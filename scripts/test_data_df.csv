1,1,"OBJECTIVES To carry out a further survey of archived appendix samples to understand better the differences between existing estimates of the prevalence of subclinical infection with prions after the bovine spongiform encephalopathy epizootic and to see whether a broader birth cohort was affected , and to understand better the implications for the management of blood and blood products and for the handling of surgical instruments . DESIGN Irreversibly unlinked and anonymised large scale survey of archived appendix samples . SETTING Archived appendix samples from the pathology departments of 41 UK hospitals participating in the earlier survey , and additional hospitals in regions with lower levels of participation in that survey . SAMPLE 32,441 archived appendix samples fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin and tested for the presence of abnormal prion protein ( PrP ) . RESULTS Of the 32,441 appendix samples 16 were positive for abnormal PrP , indicating an overall prevalence of 493 per million population ( 95 % confidence interval 282 to 801 per million ) . The prevalence in those born in 1941 - 60 ( 733 per million , 269 to 1596 per million ) did not differ significantly from those born between 1961 and 1985 ( 412 per million , 198 to 758 per million ) and was similar in both sexes and across the three broad geographical areas sampled . Genetic testing of the positive specimens for the genotype at PRNP codon 129 revealed a high proportion that were valine homozygous compared with the frequency in the normal population , and in stark contrast with confirmed clinical cases of vCJD , all of which were methionine homozygous at PRNP codon 129 . CONCLUSIONS This study corroborates previous studies and suggests a high prevalence of infection with abnormal PrP , indicating vCJD carrier status in the population compared with the 177 vCJD cases to date . These findings have important implications for the management of blood and blood products and for the handling of surgical instruments .  </s> 1/2000 in UK have abnormal PrP positivity.",SUPPORTS,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",1/2000 in UK have abnormal PrP positivity.,"RESULTS Of the 32,441 appendix samples 16 were positive for abnormal PrP , indicating an overall prevalence of 493 per million population ( 95 % confidence interval 282 to 801 per million ) . </s> 1/2000 in UK have abnormal PrP positivity.","OBJECTIVES To carry out a further survey of archived appendix samples to understand better the differences between existing estimates of the prevalence of subclinical infection with prions after the bovine spongiform encephalopathy epizootic and to see whether a broader birth cohort was affected , and to understand better the implications for the management of blood and blood products and for the handling of surgical instruments .

2,2,"BACKGROUND The heritable haemoglobinopathy alpha(+)-thalassaemia is caused by the reduced synthesis of alpha-globin chains that form part of normal adult haemoglobin ( Hb ) . Individuals homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia have microcytosis and an increased erythrocyte count . Alpha(+)-thalassaemia homozygosity confers considerable protection against severe malaria , including severe malarial anaemia ( SMA ) ( Hb concentration < 50 g/l ) , but does not influence parasite count . We tested the hypothesis that the erythrocyte indices associated with alpha(+)-thalassaemia homozygosity provide a haematological benefit during acute malaria . METHODS AND FINDINGS Data from children living on the north coast of Papua New Guinea who had participated in a case-control study of the protection afforded by alpha(+)-thalassaemia against severe malaria were reanalysed to assess the genotype-specific reduction in erythrocyte count and Hb levels associated with acute malarial disease . We observed a reduction in median erythrocyte count of approximately 1.5 x 10(12)/l in all children with acute falciparum malaria relative to values in community children ( p < 0.001 ) . We developed a simple mathematical model of the linear relationship between Hb concentration and erythrocyte count . This model predicted that children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia lose less Hb than children of normal genotype for a reduction in erythrocyte count of > 1.1 x 10(12)/l as a result of the reduced mean cell Hb in homozygous alpha(+)-thalassaemia . In addition , children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia require a 10 % greater reduction in erythrocyte count than children of normal genotype ( p = 0.02 ) for Hb concentration to fall to 50 g/l , the cutoff for SMA . We estimated that the haematological profile in children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia reduces the risk of SMA during acute malaria compared to children of normal genotype ( relative risk 0.52 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.24 - 1.12 , p = 0.09 ) . CONCLUSIONS The increased erythrocyte count and microcytosis in children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia may contribute substantially to their protection against SMA . A lower concentration of Hb per erythrocyte and a larger population of erythrocytes may be a biologically advantageous strategy against the significant reduction in erythrocyte count that occurs during acute infection with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum . This haematological profile may reduce the risk of anaemia by other Plasmodium species , as well as other causes of anaemia .

3,3,"OBJECTIVES To carry out a further survey of archived appendix samples to understand better the differences between existing estimates of the prevalence of subclinical infection with prions after the bovine spongiform encephalopathy epizootic and to see whether a broader birth cohort was affected , and to understand better the implications for the management of blood and blood products and for the handling of surgical instruments . DESIGN Irreversibly unlinked and anonymised large scale survey of archived appendix samples . SETTING Archived appendix samples from the pathology departments of 41 UK hospitals participating in the earlier survey , and additional hospitals in regions with lower levels of participation in that survey . SAMPLE 32,441 archived appendix samples fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin and tested for the presence of abnormal prion protein ( PrP ) . RESULTS Of the 32,441 appendix samples 16 were positive for abnormal PrP , indicating an overall prevalence of 493 per million population ( 95 % confidence interval 282 to 801 per million ) . The prevalence in those born in 1941 - 60 ( 733 per million , 269 to 1596 per million ) did not differ significantly from those born between 1961 and 1985 ( 412 per million , 198 to 758 per million ) and was similar in both sexes and across the three broad geographical areas sampled . Genetic testing of the positive specimens for the genotype at PRNP codon 129 revealed a high proportion that were valine homozygous compared with the frequency in the normal population , and in stark contrast with confirmed clinical cases of vCJD , all of which were methionine homozygous at PRNP codon 129 . CONCLUSIONS This study corroborates previous studies and suggests a high prevalence of infection with abnormal PrP , indicating vCJD carrier status in the population compared with the 177 vCJD cases to date . These findings have important implications for the management of blood and blood products and for the handling of surgical instruments .  </s> A total of 1,000 people in the UK are asymptomatic carriers of vCJD infection.",REFUTES,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","A total of 1,000 people in the UK are asymptomatic carriers of vCJD infection.","RESULTS Of the 32,441 appendix samples 16 were positive for abnormal PrP , indicating an overall prevalence of 493 per million population ( 95 % confidence interval 282 to 801 per million ) . </s> A total of 1,000 people in the UK are asymptomatic carriers of vCJD infection.","OBJECTIVES To carry out a further survey of archived appendix samples to understand better the differences between existing estimates of the prevalence of subclinical infection with prions after the bovine spongiform encephalopathy epizootic and to see whether a broader birth cohort was affected , and to understand better the implications for the management of blood and blood products and for the handling of surgical instruments .

4,4,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA ( ADARs ) are involved in RNA editing that converts adenosine residues to inosine specifically in double-stranded RNAs .

6,6,"Application of stem cell biology to breast cancer research has been limited by the lack of simple methods for identification and isolation of normal and malignant stem cells . Utilizing in vitro and in vivo experimental systems , we show that normal and cancer human mammary epithelial cells with increased aldehyde dehydrogenase activity ( ALDH ) have stem/progenitor properties . These cells contain the subpopulation of normal breast epithelium with the broadest lineage differentiation potential and greatest growth capacity in a xenotransplant model .

Cellular metabolism regulates tissue repair and remodelling responses to injury2 - 4 . AMPK is a critical sensor of cellular bioenergetics and controls the switch from anabolic to catabolic metabolism5 . However , the role of AMPK in fibrosis is not well understood . Here , we demonstrate that in humans with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) and in an experimental mouse model of lung fibrosis , AMPK activity is lower in fibrotic regions associated with metabolically active and apoptosis-resistant myofibroblasts . Pharmacological activation of AMPK in myofibroblasts from lungs of humans with IPF display lower fibrotic activity , along with enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and normalization of sensitivity to apoptosis .

Cellular metabolism regulates tissue repair and remodelling responses to injury2 - 4 . AMPK is a critical sensor of cellular bioenergetics and controls the switch from anabolic to catabolic metabolism5 . However , the role of AMPK in fibrosis is not well understood . Here , we demonstrate that in humans with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) and in an experimental mouse model of lung fibrosis , AMPK activity is lower in fibrotic regions associated with

However , there are considerable challenges with respect to study design , data analysis and replication . Using pooled next-generation sequencing of 507 genes implicated in the repair of DNA in 1,150 samples , an analytical strategy focused on protein-truncating variants ( PTVs ) and a large-scale sequencing case – control replication experiment in 13,642 individuals , here we show that rare PTVs in the p53-inducible protein phosphatase PPM1D are associated with predisposition to breast cancer and ovarian cancer . PPM1D PTV mutations were present in 25 out of 7,781 cases versus 1 out of 5,861 controls ( P = 1.12 × 10−5 ) , including 18 mutations in 6,912 individuals with breast cancer ( P = 2.42 × 10−4 ) and 12 mutations in 1,121 individuals with ovarian cancer ( P = 3.10 × 10−9 ) . Notably , all of the identified PPM1D PTVs were mosaic in lymphocyte DNA and clustered within a 370-base-pair region in the final exon of the gene , carboxy-terminal to the phosphatase catalytic domain . Functional studies demonstrate that the mutations result in enhanced suppression of p53 in response to ionizing radiation exposure , suggesting that the mutant alleles encode hyperactive PPM1D isoforms . Thus , although the mutations cause premature protein truncation , they do not result in the simple loss-of-function effect typically associated with this class of variant , but instead probably have a gain-of-function effect .

More generally , these data provide new insights into the role of rare and of mosaic genetic variants in common conditions , and the use of sequencing in their identification . Gliomas arising in the brainstem and thalamus are devastating tumors that are difficult to surgically resect . To determine the genetic and epigenetic landscape of these tumors , we performed exomic sequencing of 14 brainstem gliomas ( BSGs ) and 12 thalamic gliomas . We also performed targeted mutational analysis of an additional 24 such tumors and genome-wide methylation profiling of 45 gliomas . This study led to the discovery of tumor-specific mutations in PPM1D , encoding wild-type p53-induced protein phosphatase 1D ( WIP1 ) , in 37.5 % of the BSGs that harbored hallmark H3F3A mutations encoding p. Lys27Met substitutions . PPM1D mutations were mutually exclusive with TP53 mutations in BSG and attenuated p53 activation in vitro . PPM1D mutations were truncating alterations in exon 6 that enhanced the ability of PPM1D to suppress the activation of the DNA damage response checkpoint protein CHK2 .

Lys27Met substitutions . PPM1D mutations were mutually exclusive with TP53 mutations in BSG and attenuated p53 activation in vitro . PPM1D mutations were truncating alterations in exon 6 that enhanced the ability of PPM1D to suppress the activation of the DNA damage response checkpoint protein CHK2 . These results define PPM1D as a frequent target of somatic mutation and as a potential therapeutic target in brainstem gliomas . </s> Activation of PPM1D suppresses p53 function.","(0, 25870, 11, 564,

14,14,"CONTEXT Bioterrorist attacks involving letters and mail-handling systems in Washington , DC , resulted in Bacillus anthracis ( anthrax ) spore contamination in the Hart Senate Office Building and other facilities in the US Capitol 's vicinity . OBJECTIVE To provide information about the nature and extent of indoor secondary aerosolization of B anthracis spores . DESIGN Stationary and personal air samples , surface dust , and swab samples were collected under semiquiescent ( minimal activities ) and then simulated active office conditions to estimate secondary aerosolization of B anthracis spores . Nominal size characteristics , airborne concentrations , and surface contamination of B anthracis particles ( colony-forming units ) were evaluated . RESULTS Viable B anthracis spores reaerosolized under semiquiescent conditions , with a marked increase in reaerosolization during simulated active office conditions . Increases were observed for B anthracis collected on open sheep blood agar plates ( P<.001 ) and personal air monitors ( P = .01 ) during active office conditions .

CONCLUSIONS Bacillus anthracis spores used in a recent terrorist incident reaerosolized under common office activities . </s> Anthrax spores can be disposed of easily after they are dispersed.,"CONTEXT Bioterrorist attacks involving letters and mail-handling systems in Washington , DC , resulted in Bacillus anthracis ( anthrax ) spore contamination in the Hart Senate Office Building and other facilities in the US Capitol 's vicinity . OBJECTIVE To provide information about the nature and extent of indoor secondary aerosolization of B anthracis spores . DESIGN Stationary and personal air samples , surface dust , and swab samples were collected under semiquiescent ( minimal activities ) and then simulated active office conditions to estimate secondary aerosolization of B anthracis spores . Nominal size characteristics , airborne concentrations , and surface contamination of B anthracis particles ( colony-forming units ) were evaluated . RESULTS Viable B anthracis spores reaerosolized under semiquiescent conditions , with a marked increase in reaerosolization during simulated active office conditions . Increases were observed for B anthracis collected on open sheep blood agar plates ( P<.001 ) and personal air monitors ( P = .01 ) during active office conditions . These findings have important implications for appropriate respiratory protection , remediation , and reoccupancy of contaminated office environments . </s> Anthrax spores can be disposed of easily after they are dispersed.","(0, 9690, 87, 1812, 7606, 9, 5, 163, 38631, 13249, 354, 16710, 4786, 15, 31616, 14516, 58, 624, 41, 1076, 548, 19231, 18237, 45770, 1836, 1186, 9, 321, 4, 4015, 7, 155, 4,

In 2010 , there were an estimated 1.1 million incident cases of tuberculosis among the 34 million people living with HIV worldwide . Antiretroviral therapy has substantial potential to prevent HIV-associated tuberculosis . We conducted a systematic review of studies that analysed the impact of antiretroviral therapy on the incidence of tuberculosis in adults with HIV infection . METHODS AND FINDINGS PubMed , Embase , African Index Medicus , LILACS , and clinical trial registries were systematically searched . Randomised controlled trials , prospective cohort studies , and retrospective cohort studies were included if they compared tuberculosis incidence by antiretroviral therapy status in HIV-infected adults for a median of over 6 mo in developing countries . For the meta-analyses there were four categories based on CD4 counts at antiretroviral therapy initiation : ( 1 ) less than 200 cells/µl , ( 2 ) 200 to 350 cells/µl , ( 3 ) greater than 350 cells/µl , and ( 4 ) any CD4 count . Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria . Antiretroviral therapy is strongly associated with a reduction in the incidence of tuberculosis in all baseline CD4 count categories : ( 1 ) less than 200 cells/µl ( hazard ratio [ HR ] 0.16 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.07 to 0.36 ) , ( 2 ) 200 to 350 cells/µl ( HR 0.34 , 95 % CI 0.19 to 0.60 ) , ( 3 ) greater than 350 cells/µl ( HR 0.43 , 95 % CI 0.30 to 0.63 ) , and ( 4 ) any CD4 count ( HR 0.35 , 95 % CI 0.28 to 0.44 ) . There was no evidence of hazard ratio modification with respect to baseline CD4 count category ( p = 0.20 ) . CONCLUSIONS Antiretroviral therapy is strongly associated with a reduction in the incidence of tuberculosis across all CD4 count strata .

17,17,"PLoS Biology publishes today a research article by Gunther Eysenbach that is not about biology . It is about citations . It provides robust evidence that open-access articles ( OA articles ) are more immediately recognized and cited than non-OA articles . As such , it adds objective support to the belief we have always held that open-access publication speeds up scientific dialog between researchers and , consequently , should be extended to the whole scientific literature as quickly as possible . It is therefore fitting that we publish such a paper . We have long argued that papers freely available in a journal will be more often read and cited than those behind a subscription barrier . However , solid evidence to support or refute such a claim has been surprisingly hard to find . Since most open-access journals are new , comparisons of the effects of open access with established subscription-based journals are easily confounded by age and reputation . In the current study , Eysenbach compared citations compiled by Thomson Scientific ( formerly Thomson ISI ) to individual articles published between June 2004 and December 2004 in the same journal — namely , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) , which announced its open-access option for authors on June 8 of that year , with an associated publication charge of US$ 1,000 . Non-OA articles in PNAS are subject to a six-month “ toll-access ” delay before the article becomes publicly available . The results of this natural experiment are clear : in the 4 to 16 months following publication , OA articles gained a significant citation advantage over non-OA articles during the same period . They are twice as likely to be cited 4 to 10 months after publication and almost three times as likely between 10 and 16 months . Given that PNAS delays open access for only six months , the disparity between OA and non-OA articles in journals where the delay is longer or where articles remain “ toll-access ” is likely to be even greater . Eysenbach also looked at the impact of self-archiving non-OA articles . One route to open access , it is argued , is for authors to archive their published articles on their own Web sites or in institutional repositories , although this does not include an explicit business model to cover the cost of peer-review and publishing . The analysis revealed that self-archived articles are also cited less often than OA articles from the same journal . Yes , you 're right ; we do have a strong and vested interest in publishing results that so obviously endorse our existence . Moreover , the author of the article is also an editor of an open-access journal . But sometimes a potential conflict of interest can actually help to ensure rigor . In this case , we have an acute interest in ensuring that the article meets the same , if not higher , standards as any other research article we publish . Not only must the conclusions provide a significant advance for the field , but the study must be technically sound , with appropriate evidence to support those conclusions . As with all our research articles , we consulted throughout the evaluation process with an academic editor with appropriate expertise — in this case , Carol Tenopir , professor of information sciences at the University of Tennessee ( Knoxville , Tennessee , United States ) . The article was reviewed by two experts in bibliometric analyses and information science , and an experienced research biologist with expertise in statistics . They all enthusiastically supported publication , although one understandably questioned the suitability of PLoS Biology as the publication venue . We have no intention of making PLoS Biology a regular home for bibliometric studies ( even when about open access ) . What makes this study worth publishing in PLoS Biology is not only the relative strength of evidence supporting the claim but also the extent to which many ( especially other publishers ) have anticipated such an analysis . As far as we are aware , no other study has compared OA and non-OA articles from the same journal and controlled for so many potentially confounding factors . Eysenbach 's multivariate analysis took into account the number of days since publication , number of authors , article type , country of the corresponding author , funding type , subject area , submission track ( PNAS has three different ways that authors can submit a paper ) , and the previous citation record of the first and last authors . He even administered a supplementary questionnaire to assess whether authors choosing the OA option in PNAS chose to do so for only their most important research ( they did n't ) . As Ian Rowlands from the Centre for Publishing at University College London — and one of the reviewers who agreed to be identified in this article — said at the start of his review : “ Many ( most ) of the papers and presentations I have read/seen on this topic have completely failed to address the kinds of confounding issues that are so convincingly tackled here . For that reason alone , this paper deserves to be published and alerted to the widest possible audience . ” In addition to providing evidence for the immediate advantage of open access , Eysenbach 's analysis also highlights several potential challenges to its long-term future . Although a limited dataset , the citation history of the first and last authors differed between those who chose the open-access option and those who did not . In the group that chose open access , last authors tended to have a “ stronger ” previous citation record , whereas this situation was reversed among the group that declined the open-access option — here , it was the first authors who tended to be stronger . This may reflect varying attitudes of authors at different stages of their career , a stronger influence from the leader of a particular group , or an age- or career-related difference in the ability to pay the publication charge ( e.g. , [ 1 ] ) . Indeed , access to appropriate funds may also be a reason why a lower proportion of authors from European countries tended to choose the open-access option . In many of these countries , funds for page charges — and , by extension , open-access publication fees — are often not included within research grants . PNAS was one of the first journals to offer an open-access option to its authors .

The results of this natural experiment are clear : in the 4 to 16 months following publication , OA articles gained a significant citation advantage over non-OA articles during the same period . They are twice as likely to be cited 4 to 10 months after publication and almost three times as likely between 10 and 16 months . Moreover , although the evidence from the current analysis argues most strongly for a time advantage in citation for OA articles , a study over longer periods will reveal whether this translates into a sustained increase in the number of citations . </s> Articles published in open access format are less likely to be cited than traditional journals.","PLoS Biology publishes today a research article by Gunther Eysenbach that is not about biology . It is about citations . As such , it adds objective support to the belief we have always held that open-access publication speeds up scientific dialog between researchers and , consequently , should be extended to the whole scientific literature as quickly as possible . It is therefore fitting that we publish such a paper . We have long argued that papers freely available in a journal will be more often read and cited than those behind a subscription barrier . However , solid evidence to support or refute such a claim has been surprisingly hard to find . Since most open-access journals are new , comparisons of the effects of open access with established subscription-based journals are easily confounded by age and reputation . In the current study , Eysenbach compared citations compiled by Thomson Scientific ( formerly Thomson ISI ) to individual articles published between June 2004 and December 2004 in the same journal — namely , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) , which announced its open-access option for authors on June 8 of that year , with an associated publication charge of US$ 1,000 . Non-OA articles in PNAS are subject to a six-month “ toll-access ” delay before the article becomes publicly available . Given that PNAS delays open access for only six months , the disparity between OA and non-OA articles in journals where the delay is longer or where articles remain “ toll-access ” is likely to be even greater . Eysenbach also looked at the impact of self-archiving non-OA articles . One route to open access , it is argued , is for authors to archive their published articles on their own Web sites or in institutional repositories , although this does not include an explicit business model to cover the cost of peer-review and publishing . The analysis revealed that self-archived articles are also cited less often than OA articles from the same journal . Yes , you 're right ; we do have a strong and vested interest in publishing results that so obviously endorse our existence . Moreover , the author of the article is also an editor of an open-access journal . But sometimes a potential conflict of interest can actually help to ensure rigor . In this case , we have an acute interest in ensuring that the article meets the same , if not higher , standards as any other research article we publish . Not only must the conclusions provide a significant advance for the field , but the study must be technically sound , with appropriate evidence to support those conclusions . As with all our research articles , we consulted throughout the evaluation process with an academic editor with appropriate expertise — in this case , Carol Tenopir , professor of information sciences at the University of Tennessee ( Knoxville , Tennessee , United States ) . The article was reviewed by two experts in bibliometric analyses and information science , and an experienced research biologist with expertise in statistics . They all enthusiastically supported publication , although one understandably questioned the suitability of PLoS Biology as the publication venue . We have no intention of making PLoS Biology a regular home for bibliometric studies ( even when about open access ) . What makes this study worth publishing in PLoS Biology is not only the relative strength of evidence supporting the claim but also the extent to which many ( especially other publishers ) have anticipated such an analysis . As far as we are aware , no other study has compared OA and non-OA articles from the same journal and controlled for so many potentially confounding factors . Eysenbach 's multivariate analysis took into account the number of days since publication , number of authors , article type , country of the corresponding author , funding type , subject area , submission track ( PNAS has three different ways that authors can submit a paper ) , and the previous citation record of the first and last authors . He even administered a supplementary questionnaire to assess whether authors choosing the OA option in PNAS chose to do so for only their most important research ( they did n't ) . As Ian Rowlands from the Centre for Publishing at University College London — and one of the reviewers who agreed to be identified in this article — said at the start of his review : “ Many ( most ) of the papers and presentations I have read/seen on this topic have completely failed to address the kinds of confounding issues that are so convincingly tackled here . For that reason alone , this paper deserves to be published and alerted to the widest possible audience . ” In addition to providing evidence for the immediate advantage of open access , Eysenbach 's analysis also highlights several potential challenges to its long-term future . Although a limited dataset , the citation history of the first and last authors differed between those who chose the open-access option and those who did not . In the group that chose open access , last authors tended to have a “ stronger ” previous citation record , whereas this situation was reversed among the group that declined the open-access option — here , it was the first authors who tended to be stronger . This may reflect varying attitudes of authors at different stages of their career , a stronger influence from the leader of a particular group , or an age- or career-related difference in the ability to pay the publication charge ( e.g. , [ 1 ] ) . Indeed , access to appropriate funds may also be a reason why a lower proportion of authors from European countries tended to choose the open-access option . In many of these countries , funds for page charges — and , by extension , open-access publication fees — are often not included within research grants . PNAS was one of the first journals to offer an open-access option to its authors . However , such hybrid journals are increasing : Blackwell , Springer , and Oxford University Press now provide this option as well . This means that similar experiments can be replicated . In the meantime , open-access advocates should be emboldened by tangible evidence for what has seemed obvious all along . </s> Articles published in open access format are less likely to be cited than traditional journals.","(0, 243, 1639, 6295, 1283, 14, 490, 12, 28300, 7201, 36, 384, 250, 7201, 4839, 32, 55, 1320, 4984, 8, 4418, 87, 786, 12, 16024, 7201, 479, 20, 775, 9, 42, 1632, 9280, 32, 699,

18,18,"PLoS Biology publishes today a research article by Gunther Eysenbach that is not about biology . It is about citations . It provides robust evidence that open-access articles ( OA articles ) are more immediately recognized and cited than non-OA articles . As such , it adds objective support to the belief we have always held that open-access publication speeds up scientific dialog between researchers and , consequently , should be extended to the whole scientific literature as quickly as possible . It is therefore fitting that we publish such a paper . We have long argued that papers freely available in a journal will be more often read and cited than those behind a subscription barrier . However , solid evidence to support or refute such a claim has been surprisingly hard to find . Since most open-access journals are new , comparisons of the effects of open access with established subscription-based journals are easily confounded by age and reputation . In the current study , Eysenbach compared citations compiled by Thomson Scientific ( formerly Thomson ISI ) to individual articles published between June 2004 and December 2004 in the same journal — namely , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) , which announced its open-access option for authors on June 8 of that year , with an associated publication charge of US$ 1,000 . Non-OA articles in PNAS are subject to a six-month “ toll-access ” delay before the article becomes publicly available . The results of this natural experiment are clear : in the 4 to 16 months following publication , OA articles gained a significant citation advantage over non-OA articles during the same period . They are twice as likely to be cited 4 to 10 months after publication and almost three times as likely between 10 and 16 months . Given that PNAS delays open access for only six months , the disparity between OA and non-OA articles in journals where the delay is longer or where articles remain “ toll-access ” is likely to be even greater . Eysenbach also looked at the impact of self-archiving non-OA articles . One route to open access , it is argued , is for authors to archive their published articles on their own Web sites or in institutional repositories , although this does not include an explicit business model to cover the cost of peer-review and publishing . The analysis revealed that self-archived articles are also cited less often than OA articles from the same journal . Yes , you 're right ; we do have a strong and vested interest in publishing results that so obviously endorse our existence . Moreover , the author of the article is also an editor of an open-access journal . But sometimes a potential conflict of interest can actually help to ensure rigor . In this case , we have an acute interest in ensuring that the article meets the same , if not higher , standards as any other research article we publish . Not only must the conclusions provide a significant advance for the field , but the study must be technically sound , with appropriate evidence to support those conclusions . As with all our research articles , we consulted throughout the evaluation process with an academic editor with appropriate expertise — in this case , Carol Tenopir , professor of information sciences at the University of Tennessee ( Knoxville , Tennessee , United States ) . The article was reviewed by two experts in bibliometric analyses and information science , and an experienced research biologist with expertise in statistics . They all enthusiastically supported publication , although one understandably questioned the suitability of PLoS Biology as the publication venue . We have no intention of making PLoS Biology a regular home for bibliometric studies ( even when about open access ) . What makes this study worth publishing in PLoS Biology is not only the relative strength of evidence supporting the claim but also the extent to which many ( especially other publishers ) have anticipated such an analysis . As far as we are aware , no other study has compared OA and non-OA articles from the same journal and controlled for so many potentially confounding factors . Eysenbach 's multivariate analysis took into account the number of days since publication , number of authors , article type , country of the corresponding author , funding type , subject area , submission track ( PNAS has three different ways that authors can submit a paper ) , and the previous citation record of the first and last authors . He even administered a supplementary questionnaire to assess whether authors choosing the OA option in PNAS chose to do so for only their most important research ( they did n't ) . As Ian Rowlands from the Centre for Publishing at University College London — and one of the reviewers who agreed to be identified in this article — said at the start of his review : “ Many ( most ) of the papers and presentations I have read/seen on this topic have completely failed to address the kinds of confounding issues that are so convincingly tackled here . For that reason alone , this paper deserves to be published and alerted to the widest possible audience . ” In addition to providing evidence for the immediate advantage of open access , Eysenbach 's analysis also highlights several potential challenges to its long-term future . Although a limited dataset , the citation history of the first and last authors differed between those who chose the open-access option and those who did not . In the group that chose open access , last authors tended to have a “ stronger ” previous citation record , whereas this situation was reversed among the group that declined the open-access option — here , it was the first authors who tended to be stronger . This may reflect varying attitudes of authors at different stages of their career , a stronger influence from the leader of a particular group , or an age- or career-related difference in the ability to pay the publication charge ( e.g. , [ 1 ] ) . Indeed , access to appropriate funds may also be a reason why a lower proportion of authors from European countries tended to choose the open-access option . In many of these countries , funds for page charges — and , by extension , open-access publication fees — are often not included within research grants . PNAS was one of the first journals to offer an open-access option to its authors . However , such hybrid journals are increasing : Blackwell , Springer , and Oxford University Press now provide this option as well . This means that similar experiments can be replicated . Moreover , although the evidence from the current analysis argues most strongly for a time advantage in citation for OA articles , a study over longer periods will reveal whether this translates into a sustained increase in the number of citations . In the meantime , open-access advocates should be emboldened by tangible evidence for what has seemed obvious all along .  </s> Articles published in open access format are more likely to be cited than traditional journals.",SUPPORTS,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Articles published in open access format are more likely to be cited than traditional journals.,"It provides robust evidence that open-access articles ( OA articles ) are more immediately recognized and cited than non-OA articles .

Reportedly , mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) have successfully treated graft-vs-host disease . OBJECTIVE To assess autologous MSCs as replacement of antibody induction for patients with end-stage renal disease who undergo ABO-compatible , cross-match-negative kidney transplants from a living-related donor . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PATIENTS One hundred fifty-nine patients were enrolled in this single-site , prospective , open-label , randomized study from February 2008-May 2009 , when recruitment was completed . INTERVENTION Patients were inoculated with marrow-derived autologous MSC ( 1 - 2 x 10(6)/kg ) at kidney reperfusion and two weeks later . Fifty-three patients received standard-dose and 52 patients received low-dose CNIs ( 80 % of standard ) ; 51 patients in the control group received anti-IL-2 receptor antibody plus standard-dose CNIs . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary measure was 1-year incidence of acute rejection and renal function ( estimated glomerular filtration rate [ eGFR ] ) ; the secondary measure was patient and graft survival and incidence of adverse events . RESULTS Patient and graft survival at 13 to 30 months was similar in all groups . After 6 months , 4 of 53 patients ( 7.5 % ) in the autologous MSC plus standard-dose CNI group ( 95 % CI , 0.4%-14.7 % ; P = .04 ) and 4 of 52 patients ( 7.7 % ) in the low-dose group ( 95 % CI , 0.5%-14.9 % ; P = .046 ) compared with 11 of 51 controls ( 21.6 % ; 95 % CI , 10.5%-32.6 % ) had biopsy-confirmed acute rejection . None of the patients in either autologous MSC group had glucorticoid-resistant rejection , whereas 4 patients ( 7.8 % ) in the control group did ( 95 % CI , 0.6%-15.1 % ; overall P = .02 ) . Renal function recovered faster among both MSC groups showing increased eGFR levels during the first month after surgery than the control group . Patients receiving standard-dose CNI had a mean difference of 6.2 mL/min per 1.73 m(2 ) ( 95 % CI , 0.4 - 11.9 ; P=.04 ) and those in the low-dose CNI of 10.0 mL/min per 1.73 m(2 ) ( 95 % CI , 3.8 - 16.2 ; P=.002 ) . Also , during the 1-year follow-up , combined analysis of MSC-treated groups revealed significantly decreased risk of opportunistic infections than the control group ( hazard ratio , 0.42 ; 95 % CI , 0.20 - 0.85 , P=.02 ) CONCLUSION Among patients undergoing renal transplant , the use of autologous MSCs compared with anti-IL-2 receptor antibody induction therapy resulted in lower incidence of acute rejection , decreased risk of opportunistic infection , and better estimated renal function at 1 year .

Reportedly , mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) have successfully treated graft-vs-host disease . OBJECTIVE To assess autologous MSCs as replacement of antibody induction for patients with end-stage renal disease who undergo ABO-compatible , cross-match-negative kidney transplants from a living-related donor . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PATIENTS One hundred fifty-nine patients were enrolled in this single-site , prospective , open-label , randomized study from February 2008-May 2009 , when recruitment was completed . INTERVENTION Patients were inoculated with marrow-derived autologous MSC ( 1 - 2 x 10(6)/kg ) at kidney reperfusion and two weeks later . Fifty-three patients received standard-dose and 52 patients received low-dose CNIs ( 80 % of standard ) ; 51 patients in the control group received anti-IL-2 receptor antibody plus standard-dose CNIs . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary measure was 1-year incidence of acute rejection and renal function ( estimated glomerular filtration rate [ eGFR ] ) ; the secondary measure was patient and graft survival and incidence of adverse events . RESULTS Patient and graft survival at 13 to 30 months was similar in all groups . After 6 months , 4 of 53 patients ( 7.5 % ) in the autologous MSC plus standard-dose CNI group ( 95 % CI , 0.4%-14.7 % ; P = .04 ) and 4 of 52 patients ( 7.7 % ) in the low-dose group ( 95 % CI , 0.5%-14.9 % ; P = .046 ) compared with 11 of 51 controls ( 21.6 % ; 95 % CI , 10.5%-32.6 % ) had biopsy-confirmed acute rejection . None of the patients in either autologous MSC group had glucorticoid-resistant rejection , whereas 4 patients ( 7.8 % ) in the control group did ( 95 % CI , 0.6%-15.1 % ; overall P = .02 ) . Renal function recovered faster among both MSC groups showing increased eGFR levels during the first month after surgery than the control group . Patients receiving standard-dose CNI had a mean difference of 6.2 mL/min per 1.73 m(2 ) ( 95 % CI , 0.4 - 11.9 ; P=.04 ) and those in the low-dose CNI of 10.0 mL/min per 1.73 m(2 ) ( 95 % CI , 3.8 - 16.2 ; P=.002 ) . Also , during the 1-year follow-up , combined analysis of MSC-treated groups revealed significantly decreased risk of opportunistic infections than the control group ( hazard ratio , 0.42 ; 95 % CI , 0.20 - 0.85 , P=.02 ) CONCLUSION Among patients undergoing renal transplant , the use of autologous MSCs compared with anti-IL-2 receptor antibody induction therapy resulted in lower incidence of acute rejection , decreased risk of opportunistic infection , and better estimated renal function at 1 year .

Reportedly , mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) have successfully treated graft-vs-host disease . OBJECTIVE To assess autologous MSCs as replacement of antibody induction for patients with end-stage renal disease who undergo ABO-compatible , cross-match-negative kidney transplants from a living-related donor . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PATIENTS One hundred fifty-nine patients were enrolled in this single-site , prospective , open-label , randomized study from February 2008-May 2009 , when recruitment was completed . INTERVENTION Patients were inoculated with marrow-derived autologous MSC ( 1 - 2 x 10(6)/kg ) at kidney reperfusion and two weeks later . Fifty-three patients received standard-dose and 52 patients received low-dose CNIs ( 80 % of standard ) ; 51 patients in the control group received anti-IL-2 receptor antibody plus standard-dose CNIs . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary measure was 1-year incidence of acute rejection and renal function ( estimated glomerular filtration rate [ eGFR ] ) ; the secondary measure was patient and graft survival and incidence of adverse events . RESULTS Patient and graft survival at 13 to 30 months was similar in all groups . After 6 months , 4 of 53 patients ( 7.5 % ) in the autologous MSC plus standard-dose CNI group ( 95 % CI , 0.4%-14.7 % ; P = .04 ) and 4 of 52 patients ( 7.7 % ) in the low-dose group ( 95 % CI , 0.5%-14.9 % ; P = .046 ) compared with 11 of 51 controls ( 21.6 % ; 95 % CI , 10.5%-32.6 % ) had biopsy-confirmed acute rejection . None of the patients in either autologous MSC group had glucorticoid-resistant rejection , whereas 4 patients ( 7.8 % ) in the control group did ( 95 % CI , 0.6%-15.1 % ; overall P = .02 ) . Renal function recovered faster among both MSC groups showing increased eGFR levels during the first month after surgery than the control group . Patients receiving standard-dose CNI had a mean difference of 6.2 mL/min per 1.73 m(2 ) ( 95 % CI , 0.4 - 11.9 ; P=.04 ) and those in the low-dose CNI of 10.0 mL/min per 1.73 m(2 ) ( 95 % CI , 3.8 - 16.2 ; P=.002 ) . Also , during the 1-year follow-up , combined analysis of MSC-treated groups revealed significantly decreased risk of opportunistic infections than the control group ( hazard ratio , 0.42 ; 95 % CI , 0.20 - 0.85 , P=.02 ) CONCLUSION Among patients undergoing renal transplant , the use of autologous MSCs compared with anti-IL-2 receptor antibody induction therapy resulted in lower incidence of acute rejection , decreased risk of opportunistic infection , and better estimated renal function at 1 year .

28,28,"BACKGROUND Birth size , perhaps a proxy for prenatal environment , might be a correlate of subsequent breast cancer risk , but findings from epidemiological studies have been inconsistent . We re-analysed individual participant data from published and unpublished studies to obtain more precise estimates of the magnitude and shape of the birth size-breast cancer association . METHODS AND FINDINGS Studies were identified through computer-assisted and manual searches , and personal communication with investigators . Individual participant data from 32 studies , comprising 22,058 breast cancer cases , were obtained . Random effect models were used , if appropriate , to combine study-specific estimates of effect . Birth weight was positively associated with breast cancer risk in studies based on birth records ( pooled relative risk [ RR ] per one standard deviation [ SD ] [ = 0.5 kg ] increment in birth weight : 1.06 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.02 - 1.09 ) and parental recall when the participants were children ( 1.02 ; 95 % CI 0.99 - 1.05 ) , but not in those based on adult self-reports , or maternal recall during the woman 's adulthood ( 0.98 ; 95 % CI 0.95 - 1.01 ) ( p for heterogeneity between data sources = 0.003 ) . Relative to women who weighed 3.000 - 3.499 kg , the risk was 0.96 ( CI 0.80 - 1.16 ) in those who weighed < 2.500 kg , and 1.12 ( 95 % CI 1.00 - 1.25 ) in those who weighed > or = 4.000 kg ( p for linear trend = 0.001 ) in birth record data . Birth length and head circumference from birth records were also positively associated with breast cancer risk ( pooled RR per one SD increment : 1.06 [ 95 % CI 1.03 - 1.10 ] and 1.09 [ 95 % CI 1.03 - 1.15 ] , respectively ) . Simultaneous adjustment for these three birth size variables showed that length was the strongest independent predictor of risk . The birth size effects did not appear to be confounded or mediated by established breast cancer risk factors and were not modified by age or menopausal status . The cumulative incidence of breast cancer per 100 women by age 80 y in the study populations was estimated to be 10.0 , 10.0 , 10.4 , and 11.5 in those who were , respectively , in the bottom , second , third , and top fourths of the birth length distribution . CONCLUSIONS This pooled analysis of individual participant data is consistent with birth size , and in particular birth length , being an independent correlate of breast cancer risk in adulthood . INTRODUCTION Various perinatal factors , including birth weight , birth order , maternal age , gestational age , twin status , and parental smoking , have been postulated to affect breast cancer risk in daughters by altering the hormonal environment of the developing fetal mammary glands . Despite ample biologic plausibility , epidemiologic studies to date have yielded conflicting results . We investigated the associations between perinatal factors and subsequent breast cancer risk through meta-analyses . METHODS We reviewed breast cancer studies published from January 1966 to February 2007 that included data on birth weight , birth order , maternal age , gestational age , twin status , and maternal or paternal smoking . Meta-analyses using random effect models were employed to summarize the results . RESULTS We found that heavier birth weights were associated with increased breast cancer risk , with studies involving five categories of birth weight identifying odds ratios ( ORs ) of 1.24 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.04 to 1.48 ) for 4,000 g or more and 1.15 ( 95 % CI 1.04 to 1.26 ) for 3,500 g to 3,999 g , relative to a birth weight of 2,500 to 2,599 g. These studies provided no support for a J-shaped relationship of birthweight to risk . Support for an association with birthweight was also derived from studies based on three birth weight categories ( OR 1.15 [ 95 % CI 1.01 to 1.31 ] for > or = 4,000 g relative to < 3,000 g ) and two birth weight categories ( OR 1.09 [ 95 % CI 1.02 to 1.18 ] for > or = 3,000 g relative to < 3,000 g ) . Women born to older mothers and twins were also at some increased risk , but the results were heterogeneous across studies and publication years . Birth order , prematurity , and maternal smoking were unrelated to breast cancer risk . CONCLUSION Our findings provide some support for the hypothesis that in utero exposures reflective of higher endogenous hormone levels could affect risk for development of breast cancer in adulthood . BACKGROUND Emerging evidence suggests an association between female prenatal experience and her subsequent risk of developing breast cancer . Potential underlying mechanisms include variation in amounts of maternal endogenous sex hormones and growth hormones , germ-cell mutations , formation of cancer stem-cells , and other genetic or epigenetic events . We reviewed and summarised quantitatively the available data on intrauterine exposures and risk of breast cancer . METHODS We systematically searched for studies that assessed association between perinatal factors and risk of breast cancer . We reviewed separately each of the perinatal factors , including birthweight , birth length , parental age at delivery , gestational age , intrauterine exposure to diethylstilbestrol , twin membership , maternal pre-eclampsia or eclampsia , and other factors . FINDINGS We identified 57 studies published between Oct 1 , 1980 , and June 21 , 2007 . Increased risk of breast cancer was noted with increased birthweight ( relative risk [ RR ] 1.15 [ 95 % CI 1.09 - 1.21 ] ) , birth length ( 1.28 [ 1.11 - 1.48 ] ) , higher maternal age ( 1.13 [ 1.02 - 1.25 ] ) , and paternal age ( 1.12 [ 1.05 - 1.19 ] ) . Decreased risk of breast cancer was noted for maternal pre-eclampsia and eclampsia ( 0.48 [ 0.30 - 0.78 ] ) and twin membership ( 0.93 [ 0.87 - 1.00 ] ) . No association was noted between risk of breast cancer and gestational age at birth ( 0.95 [ 0.71 - 1.26 ] ) or maternal diethylstilbestrol treatment ( 1.40 [ 0.86 - 2.28 ] ) . INTERPRETATION The intrauterine environment contributes to the predisposition of women to breast cancer in adulthood . The in-utero mechanisms responsible for such predisposition need to be elucidated . Breast cancer may originate in utero . We reviewed the available evidence on the association between birthweight and the risk of breast cancer . To date , 26 research papers addressing this issue have been published . The majority of studies identified a positive link between birthweight and premenopausal , but not postmenopausal , breast cancer . The relative risk estimate for breast cancer comparing women with high birthweight to women with low birthweight combining all studies including both pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer was 1.23 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.13 - 1.34 ) . The mechanisms underlying this association likely include elevated levels of growth factors that may increase the number of susceptible stem cells in the mammary gland or initiate tumors through DNA mutations .

METHODS AND FINDINGS Studies were identified through computer-assisted and manual searches , and personal communication with investigators . Individual participant data from 32 studies , comprising 22,058 breast cancer cases , were obtained . Random effect models were used Birth weight was positively associated with breast cancer risk in studies based on birth records ( pooled relative risk [ RR ] per one standard deviation [ SD ] [ = 0.5 kg ] increment in birth weight : 1.06 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.02 - 1.09 ) and parental recall when the participants were children ( 1.02 ; 95 % CI 0.99 - 1.05 ) , but not in those based on adult self-reports , or maternal recall during the woman 's adulthood ( 0.98 ; 95 % CI 0.95 - 1.01 ) ( p for heterogeneity between data sources = 0.003 ) . Relative to women who weighed 3.000 - 3.499 kg , the risk was 0.96 ( CI 0.80 - 1.16 ) in those who weighed < 2.500 kg , and 1.12 ( 95 % CI 1.00 - 1.25 ) in those who weighed > or = 4.000 kg ( p for linear trend = 0.001 ) in birth record data . adjustment for these three birth size variables showed that length was the strongest independent predictor of risk . The birth size effects did not appear to be confounded or mediated CONCLUSIONS This pooled analysis of individual participant data is consistent with birth size , and in particular birth length , being an independent correlate of breast cancer risk in adulthood . </s> Birth-weight is positively associated with breast cancer.","BACKGROUND Birth size , perhaps a proxy for prenatal environment , might be a correlate of subsequent breast cancer risk , but findings from epidemiological studies have been inconsistent . We re-analysed individual participant data from published , if appropriate , to combine study-specific estimates of effect . Birth length and head circumference from birth records were also positively associated with breast cancer risk ( pooled RR per one SD increment : 1.06 [ 95 % CI 1.03 - 1.10 ] and 1.09 [ 95 % CI 1.03 - 1.15 ] , respectively ) . Simultaneous by established breast cancer risk factors and were not modified by age or menopausal status . The cumulative incidence of breast cancer per 100 women by age 80 y in the study populations was estimated to be 10.0 , 10.0 , 10.4 , and 11.5 in those who were , respectively , in the bottom , second , third , and top fourths of the birth length distribution . INTRODUCTION Various perinatal factors , including birth weight , birth order , maternal age , gestational age , twin status , and parental smoking , have been postulated to affect breast cancer risk in daughters by altering the hormonal environment of the developing fetal mammary glands . Despite ample biologic plausibility , epidemiologic studies to date have yielded conflicting results . We investigated the associations between perinatal factors and subsequent breast cancer risk through meta-analyses . METHODS We reviewed breast cancer studies published from January 1966 to February 2007 that included data on birth weight , birth order , maternal age , gestational age , twin status , and maternal or paternal smoking . Meta-analyses using random effect models were employed to summarize the results . RESULTS We found that heavier birth weights were associated with increased breast cancer risk , with studies involving five categories of birth weight identifying odds ratios ( ORs ) of 1.24 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.04 to 1.48 ) for 4,000 g or more and 1.15 ( 95 % CI 1.04 to 1.26 ) for 3,500 g to 3,999 g , relative to a birth weight of 2,500 to 2,599 g. These studies provided no support for a J-shaped relationship of birthweight to risk . Support for an association with birthweight was also derived from studies based on three birth weight categories ( OR 1.15 [ 95 % CI 1.01 to 1.31 ] for > or = 4,000 g relative to < 3,000 g ) and two birth weight categories ( OR 1.09 [ 95 % CI 1.02 to 1.18 ] for > or = 3,000 g relative to < 3,000 g ) . Women born to older mothers and twins were also at some increased risk , but the results were heterogeneous across studies and publication years . Birth order , prematurity , and maternal smoking were unrelated to breast cancer risk . CONCLUSION Our findings provide some support for the hypothesis that in utero exposures reflective of higher endogenous hormone levels could affect risk for development of breast cancer in adulthood . BACKGROUND Emerging evidence suggests an association between female prenatal experience and her subsequent risk of developing breast cancer . Potential underlying mechanisms include variation in amounts of maternal endogenous sex hormones and growth hormones , germ-cell mutations , formation of cancer stem-cells , and other genetic or epigenetic events . We reviewed and summarised quantitatively the available data on intrauterine exposures and risk of breast cancer . METHODS We systematically searched for studies that assessed association between perinatal factors and risk of breast cancer . We reviewed separately each of the perinatal factors , including birthweight , birth length , parental age at delivery , gestational age , intrauterine exposure to diethylstilbestrol , twin membership , maternal pre-eclampsia or eclampsia , and other factors . FINDINGS We identified 57 studies published between Oct 1 , 1980 , and June 21 , 2007 . Increased risk of breast cancer was noted with increased birthweight ( relative risk [ RR ] 1.15 [ 95 % CI 1.09 - 1.21 ] ) , birth length ( 1.28 [ 1.11 - 1.48 ] ) , higher maternal age ( 1.13 [ 1.02 - 1.25 ] ) , and paternal age ( 1.12 [ 1.05 - 1.19 ] ) . Decreased risk of breast cancer was noted for maternal pre-eclampsia and eclampsia ( 0.48 [ 0.30 - 0.78 ] ) and twin membership ( 0.93 [ 0.87 - 1.00 ] ) . No association was noted between risk of breast cancer and gestational age at birth ( 0.95 [ 0.71 - 1.26 ] ) or maternal diethylstilbestrol treatment ( 1.40 [ 0.86 - 2.28 ] ) . INTERPRETATION The intrauterine environment contributes to the predisposition of women to breast cancer in adulthood . The in-utero mechanisms responsible for such predisposition need to be elucidated . Breast cancer may originate in utero . We reviewed the available evidence on the association between birthweight and the risk of breast cancer . To date , 26 research papers addressing this issue have been published . The majority of studies identified a positive link between birthweight and premenopausal , but not postmenopausal , breast cancer . The relative risk estimate for breast cancer comparing women with high birthweight to women with low birthweight combining all studies including both pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer was 1.23 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.13 - 1.34 ) . The mechanisms underlying this association likely include elevated levels of growth factors that may increase the number of susceptible stem cells in the mammary gland or initiate tumors through DNA mutations . Loss of imprinting ( LOI ) of growth hormone genes relevant for intrauterine growth , such as insulin-like growth factor 2 ( IGF2 ) , leads to abnormally high levels of these hormones evidenced by high birthweight . LOI of IGF2 has also been found in mammary tumor tissue . The role of environmental factors that stimulate such epigenetic regulation of gene expression remains to be elucidated . </s> Birth-weight is positively associated with breast cancer.","(0, 463,

30,30,"Despite accumulating evidence suggesting local self-maintenance of tissue macrophages in the steady state , the dogma remains that tissue macrophages derive from monocytes . Using parabiosis and fate-mapping approaches , we confirmed that monocytes do not show significant contribution to tissue macrophages in the steady state . Similarly , we found that after depletion of lung macrophages , the majority of repopulation occurred by stochastic cellular proliferation in situ in a macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-Csf)- and granulocyte macrophage (GM)-CSF-dependent manner but independently of interleukin-4 .

Using parabiosis and fate-mapping approaches , we confirmed that monocytes do not show significant contribution to tissue macrophages in the steady state . Similarly , we found that after depletion of lung macrophages , the majority of repopulation occurred by stochastic cellular proliferation in situ in a macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-Csf)- and granulocyte macrophage (GM)-CSF-dependent manner but independently of interleukin-4 .

Here , we report that epigenetic drift is conserved across species and the rate of drift correlates with lifespan when comparing mice , rhesus monkeys , and humans . Twenty-two to 30-year-old rhesus monkeys exposed to 30 % caloric restriction since 7 - 14 years of age showed attenuation of age-related methylation drift compared to ad libitum-fed controls such that their blood methylation age appeared 7 years younger than their chronologic age . Even more pronounced effects were seen in 2.7 - 3.2-year-old mice exposed to 40 % caloric restriction starting at 0.3 years of age . The effects of caloric restriction on DNA methylation were detectable across different tissues and correlated with gene expression . We propose that epigenetic drift is a determinant of lifespan in mammals . Caloric restriction has been shown to increase lifespan in mammals .

Even more pronounced effects were seen in 2.7 - 3.2-year-old mice exposed to 40 % caloric restriction starting at 0.3 years of age . Caloric restriction has been shown to increase lifespan in mammals . Here , the authors provide evidence that age-related methylation drift correlates with lifespan and that caloric restriction in mice and rhesus monkeys results in attenuation of age-related methylation drift . </s> CR is associated with higher methylation age.","In mammals , caloric restriction consistently results in extended lifespan . Here , we report that epigenetic drift is conserved across species and the rate of drift correlates with lifespan when comparing mice , rhesus monkeys , and humans . The effects of caloric restriction on DNA methylation were detectable across different tissues and correlated with gene expression . We propose that epigenetic drift is a determinant of lifespan in mammals . </s> CR is associated with higher methylation age.","(0, 39318, 8554, 15557, 335, 45320, 30, 5708, 39902, 1258, 16, 18412,

38,38,"BACKGROUND Alcohol has been reported to be a common and modifiable risk factor for hypertension . However , observational studies are subject to confounding by other behavioural and sociodemographic factors , while clinical trials are difficult to implement and have limited follow-up time . Mendelian randomization can provide robust evidence on the nature of this association by use of a common polymorphism in aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 ( ALDH2 ) as a surrogate for measuring alcohol consumption . ALDH2 encodes a major enzyme involved in alcohol metabolism . Individuals homozygous for the null variant ( * 2 * 2 ) experience adverse symptoms when drinking alcohol and consequently drink considerably less alcohol than wild-type homozygotes ( * 1 * 1 ) or heterozygotes . We hypothesise that this polymorphism may influence the risk of hypertension by affecting alcohol drinking behaviour . METHODS AND FINDINGS We carried out fixed effect meta-analyses of the ALDH2 genotype with blood pressure ( five studies , n = 7,658 ) and hypertension ( three studies , n = 4,219 ) using studies identified via systematic review . In males , we obtained an overall odds ratio of 2.42 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.66 - 3.55 , p = 4.8 x 10(-6 ) ) for hypertension comparing * 1 * 1 with * 2 * 2 homozygotes and an odds ratio of 1.72 ( 95 % CI 1.17 - 2.52 , p = 0.006 ) comparing heterozygotes ( surrogate for moderate drinkers ) with * 2 * 2 homozygotes . Systolic blood pressure was 7.44 mmHg ( 95 % CI 5.39 - 9.49 , p = 1.1 x 10(-12 ) ) greater among * 1 * 1 than among * 2 * 2 homozygotes , and 4.24 mmHg ( 95 % CI 2.18 - 6.31 , p = 0.00005 ) greater among heterozygotes than among * 2 * 2 homozygotes .

In males , we obtained an overall odds ratio of 2.42 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.66 - 3.55 , p = 4.8 x 10(-6 ) ) for hypertension comparing * 1 * 1 with * 2 * 2 homozygotes and an odds ratio of 1.72 ( 95 % CI 1.17 - 2.52 , p = 0.006 ) comparing heterozygotes ( surrogate for moderate drinkers ) with * 2 * 2 homozygotes . Systolic blood pressure was 7.44 mmHg ( 95 % CI 5.39 - 9.49 , p = 1.1 x 10(-12 ) ) greater among * 1 * 1 than among * 2 * 2 homozygotes , and 4.24 mmHg ( 95 % CI 2.18 - 6.31 , p = 0.00005 ) greater among heterozygotes than among * 2 * 2 homozygotes . CONCLUSIONS These findings support the hypothesis that alcohol intake has a marked effect on blood pressure and the risk of hypertension . </s> Carriers of the alcohol aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency mutation drink less that non-carries.","(0, 43174, 29, 9486, 48259, 1827, 13, 5, 23796, 17390, 36, 1009, 132, 1009, 132, 4839, 676, 12661, 5298, 77, 4835, 3766, 8, 28766, 4076, 14299, 540,

44,44,"BACKGROUND Endothelium-dependent modulation of coronary tone is impaired in the collateral-dependent coronary microcirculation . We used a porcine model of chronic coronary occlusion and collateral development to evaluate the hypothesis that exercise training enhances endothelium-mediated relaxation and increases endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( ecNOS ) mRNA levels of collateral-dependent microvasculature . METHODS AND RESULTS Adult female miniature swine were subjected to chronic , progressive ameroid occlusion of the proximal left circumflex coronary artery ( LCx ) ; after 2 months , animals were randomly exposed to 16-week exercise-training ( EX group ; treadmill running ) or sedentary ( SED group ; cage confinement ) protocols . After completion of EX or SED programs , coronary arterioles ( approximately 100 microm in diameter ) were isolated from collateral-dependent LCx ( distal to occlusion ) and nonoccluded left anterior descending coronary artery ( LAD ) regions of each heart . Arterioles were studied by in vitro videomicroscopy or frozen for ecNOS mRNA analysis ( RT-PCR techniques ) . Relaxation to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator bradykinin was decreased ( P<0.05 ) in arterioles isolated from collateral-dependent LCx versus nonoccluded LAD regions of SED animals . Bradykinin-mediated relaxation , however , was not different in LCx versus LAD arterioles isolated from EX animals . Nitroprusside-induced relaxation was unaffected by either chronic occlusion or exercise . Importantly , ecNOS mRNA expression was significantly decreased in arterioles isolated from LCx versus LAD regions of SED animals . After training , ecNOS mRNA expression was not different between LAD and LCx arterioles . CONCLUSIONS These data indicate that exercise training enhances bradykinin-mediated relaxation of collateral-dependent LCx arterioles isolated after chronic coronary occlusion , most likely because of effects on ecNOS mRNA expression and increased production of NO . BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that vasodilator responses of porcine coronary resistance arteries are increased by exercise training . METHODS AND RESULTS Yucatan miniature swine were randomly divided into groups of exercise-trained ( ET ) and sedentary ( SED ) control pigs . ET pigs were placed on a progressive treadmill training program lasting 16 to 20 weeks , and SED pigs remained inactive during the same time period . Coronary resistance arteries 64 to 157 microns in diameter were isolated for in vitro evaluation of relaxation responses to the endothelium-independent dilators sodium nitroprusside ( 1 x 10(-10 ) to 1 x 10(-4 ) mol/L ) and adenosine ( 1 x 10(-10 ) to 1 x 10(-5 ) mol/L ) and to bradykinin ( 1 x 10(-13 ) to 3 x 10(-7 ) mol/L ) , an endothelium-dependent agent . Relaxation responses to adenosine and sodium nitroprusside were not altered by exercise training . Endothelium-dependent relaxation to bradykinin was enhanced in coronary resistance arteries from ET pigs ( IC50 : ET , 0.07 + /- 0.02 nmol/L ; SED , 1.59 + /- 0.09 nmol/L ) . To determine whether prostanoids and/or the nitric oxide synthase pathway were involved in the ET-induced changes in bradykinin-induced vasodilation , responses to bradykinin were examined in coronary resistance arteries from both ET and SED pigs in the presence of indomethacin and in the presence of nitro-monomethyl L-arginine ( L-NMMA ) . Both indomethacin and L-NMMA produced significant inhibition of the bradykinin-induced relaxation in vessels from both groups . Despite decreased bradykinin-induced relaxation after indomethacin , bradykinin-induced vasodilation was still enhanced in vessels from the ET group . L-NMMA caused greater inhibition of the bradykinin-induced relaxation in coronary resistance arteries from ET pigs relative to arteries from SED pigs and eliminated the training-induced enhancement of the bradykinin responses . CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that exercise training enhances bradykinin-induced vasodilation through increased endothelium-derived relaxing factor/nitric oxide production by the L-arginine/nitric oxide synthase pathway .  </s> Chronic aerobic exercise alters endothelial function, improving vasodilating mechanisms mediated by NO.",SUPPORTS,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","Chronic aerobic exercise alters endothelial function, improving vasodilating mechanisms mediated by NO.","Relaxation to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator bradykinin was decreased ( P<0.05 ) in arterioles isolated from collateral-dependent LCx versus nonoccluded LAD regions of SED animals .

OBJECTIVE To determine efficacy and safety of varenicline and bupropion sustained-release ( SR ; combination therapy ) compared with varenicline ( monotherapy ) in cigarette smokers . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized , blinded , placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial with a 12-week treatment period and follow-up through week 52 conducted between October 2009 and April 2013 at 3 midwestern clinical research sites . Five hundred six adult ( ≥18 years ) cigarette smokers were randomly assigned and 315 ( 62 % ) completed the study . INTERVENTIONS Twelve weeks of varenicline and bupropion SR or varenicline and placebo . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was abstinence rates at week 12 , defined as prolonged ( no smoking from 2 weeks after the target quit date ) abstinence and 7-day point-prevalence ( no smoking past 7 days ) abstinence . Secondary outcomes were prolonged and point-prevalence smoking abstinence rates at weeks 26 and 52 . Outcomes were biochemically confirmed . RESULTS At 12 weeks , 53.0 % of the combination therapy group achieved prolonged smoking abstinence and 56.2 % achieved 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence compared with 43.2 % and 48.6 % in varenicline monotherapy ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 1.49 ; 95 % CI , 1.05 - 2.12 ; P = .03 and OR , 1.36 ; 95 % CI , 0.95 - 1.93 ; P = .09 , respectively ) . At 26 weeks , 36.6 % of the combination therapy group achieved prolonged and 38.2 % achieved 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence compared with 27.6 % and 31.9 % in varenicline monotherapy ( OR , 1.52 ; 95 % CI , 1.04 - 2.22 ; P = .03 and OR , 1.32 ; 95 % CI , 0.91 - 1.91 ; P = .14 , respectively ) . At 52 weeks , 30.9 % of the combination therapy group achieved prolonged and 36.6 % achieved 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence compared with 24.5 % and 29.2 % in varenicline monotherapy ( OR , 1.39 ; 95 % CI , 0.93 - 2.07 ; P = .11 and OR , 1.40 ; 95 % CI , 0.96 - 2.05 ; P = .08 , respectively ) . Participants receiving combination therapy reported more anxiety ( 7.2 % vs 3.1 % ; P = .04 ) and depressive symptoms ( 3.6 % vs 0.8 % ; P = .03 ) . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among cigarette smokers , combined use of varenicline and bupropion , compared with varenicline alone , increased prolonged abstinence but not 7-day point prevalence at 12 and 26 weeks . Neither outcome was significantly different at 52 weeks . Further research is required to determine the role of combination therapy in smoking cessation .

46,46,"Somatic mutations that activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3 K ) have been identified in the p110-alpha catalytic subunit ( encoded by PIK3CA ) . They are most frequently observed in two hotspots : the helical domain ( E545 K and E542 K ) and the kinase domain ( H1047R ) . Although the p110-alpha mutants are transforming in vitro , their oncogenic potential has not been assessed in genetically engineered mouse models . Furthermore , clinical trials with PI3 K inhibitors have recently been initiated , and it is unknown if their efficacy will be restricted to specific , genetically defined malignancies . In this study , we engineered a mouse model of lung adenocarcinomas initiated and maintained by expression of p110-alpha H1047R . Treatment of these tumors with NVP-BEZ235 , a dual pan-PI3 K and mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibitor in clinical development , led to marked tumor regression as shown by positron emission tomography-computed tomography , magnetic resonance imaging and microscopic examination . In contrast , mouse lung cancers driven by mutant Kras did not substantially respond to single-agent NVP-BEZ235 . However , when NVP-BEZ235 was combined with a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( MEK ) inhibitor , ARRY-142886 , there was marked synergy in shrinking these Kras-mutant cancers . These in vivo studies suggest that inhibitors of the PI3K-mTOR pathway may be active in cancers with PIK3CA mutations and , when combined with MEK inhibitors , may effectively treat KRAS mutated lung cancers . Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( PI3 K ) pathway deregulation is a common event in human cancer , either through inactivation of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10 or activating mutations of p110-alpha . These hotspot mutations result in oncogenic activity of the enzyme and contribute to therapeutic resistance to the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab . The PI3 K pathway is , therefore , an attractive target for cancer therapy . We have studied NVP-BEZ235 , a dual inhibitor of the PI3 K and the downstream mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) . NVP-BEZ235 inhibited the activation of the downstream effectors Akt , S6 ribosomal protein , and 4EBP1 in breast cancer cells . The antiproliferative activity of NVP-BEZ235 was superior to the allosteric selective mTOR complex inhibitor everolimus in a panel of 21 cancer cell lines of different origin and mutation status . The described Akt activation due to mTOR inhibition was prevented by higher doses of NVP-BEZ235 . NVP-BEZ235 reversed the hyperactivation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway caused by the oncogenic mutations of p110-alpha , E545 K , and H1047R , and inhibited the proliferation of HER2-amplified BT474 cells exogenously expressing these mutations that render them resistant to trastuzumab . In trastuzumab-resistant BT474 H1047R breast cancer xenografts , NVP-BEZ235 inhibited PI3 K signaling and had potent antitumor activity . In treated animals , there was complete inhibition of PI3 K signaling in the skin at pharmacologically active doses , suggesting that skin may serve as surrogate tissue for pharmacodynamic studies . In summary , NVP-BEZ235 inhibits the PI3K/mTOR axis and results in antiproliferative and antitumoral activity in cancer cells with both wild-type and mutated p110-alpha .  </s> Combining phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase and MEK 1/2 inhibitors is effective at treating KRAS mutant tumors.",SUPPORTS,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Combining phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase and MEK 1/2 inhibitors is effective at treating KRAS mutant tumors.,"However , when NVP-BEZ235 was combined with a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( MEK ) inhibitor , ARRY-142886 , there was marked synergy in shrinking these Kras-mutant cancers .

OBJECTIVE To assess whether dexamethasone dose-dependently reduces the risk of PONV at 24 hours after tonsillectomy . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PATIENTS Randomized placebo-controlled trial conducted among 215 children undergoing elective tonsillectomy at a major public teaching hospital in Switzerland from February 2005 to December 2007 . INTERVENTIONS Children were randomly assigned to receive dexamethasone ( 0.05 , 0.15 , or 0.5 mg/kg ) or placebo intravenously after induction of anesthesia . Acetaminophen-codeine and ibuprofen were given as postoperative analgesia . Follow-up continued until the 10th postoperative day . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary end point was prevention of PONV at 24 hours ; secondary end points were decrease in the need for ibuprofen at 24 hours and evaluation of adverse effects . RESULTS At 24 hours , 24 of 54 participants who received placebo ( 44 % ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 31%-59 % ) had experienced PONV compared with 20 of 53 ( 38 % ; 95 % CI , 25%-52 % ) , 13 of 54 ( 24 % ; 95 % CI , 13%-38 % ) , and 6 of 52 ( 12 % ; 95 % CI , 4%-23 % ) who received dexamethasone at 0.05 , 0.15 , and 0.5 mg/kg , respectively ( P<.001 for linear trend ) . Children who received dexamethasone received significantly less ibuprofen . There were 26 postoperative bleeding episodes in 22 children . Two of 53 ( 4 % ; 95 % CI , 0.5%-13 % ) children who received placebo had bleeding compared with 6 of 53 ( 11 % ; 95 % CI , 4%-23 % ) , 2 of 51 ( 4 % ; 95 % CI , 0.5%-13 % ) , and 12 of 50 ( 24 % ; 95 % CI , 13%-38 % ) who received dexamethasone at 0.05 , 0.15 , and 0.5 mg/kg , respectively ( P = .003 ) . Dexamethasone , 0.5 mg/kg , was associated with the highest bleeding risk ( adjusted relative risk , 6.80 ; 95 % CI , 1.77 - 16.5 ) . Eight children had to undergo emergency reoperation because of bleeding , all of whom had received dexamethasone . The trial was stopped early for safety reasons . CONCLUSION In this study of children undergoing tonsillectomy , dexamethasone decreased the risk of PONV dose dependently but was associated with an increased risk of postoperative bleeding .

METHODS AND RESULTS Prospectively collected data from 6 different countries in the Organization to Assess Strategies for Ischemic Syndromes ( OASIS ) registry were analyzed to determine the 2-year prognosis of diabetic and nondiabetic patients who were hospitalized with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction . Overall , 1718 of 8013 registry patients ( 21 % ) had diabetes . Diabetic patients had a higher rate of coronary bypass surgery than nondiabetic patients ( 23 % versus 20 % , P:<0.001 ) but had similar rates of catheterization and angioplasty .

54,54,"Inflammation induced by recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns markedly affects subsequent adaptive responses . We asked whether the adaptive immune system can also affect the character and magnitude of innate inflammatory responses .

56,56,"OBJECTIVES To determine the incidence and clinical importance of errors in the preparation and administration of intravenous drugs and the stages of the process in which errors occur . DESIGN Prospective ethnographic study using disguised observation . PARTICIPANTS Nurses who prepared and administered intravenous drugs . SETTING 10 wards in a teaching and non-teaching hospital in the United Kingdom . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Number , type , and clinical importance of errors . RESULTS 249 errors were identified . At least one error occurred in 212 out of 430 intravenous drug doses ( 49 % , 95 % confidence interval 45 % to 54 % ) . Three doses ( 1 % ) had potentially severe errors , 126 ( 29 % ) potentially moderate errors , and 83 ( 19 % ) potentially minor errors .

57,57,"OBJECTIVE To determine whether higher past exposure to particulate air pollution is associated with prevalent high symptoms of anxiety . DESIGN Observational cohort study . SETTING Nurses ' Health Study . PARTICIPANTS 71,271 women enrolled in the Nurses ' Health Study residing throughout the contiguous United States who had valid estimates on exposure to particulate matter for at least one exposure period of interest and data on anxiety symptoms . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Meaningfully high symptoms of anxiety , defined as a score of 6 points or greater on the phobic anxiety subscale of the Crown-Crisp index , administered in 2004 . RESULTS The 71,271 eligible women were aged between 57 and 85 years ( mean 70 years ) at the time of assessment of anxiety symptoms , with a prevalence of high anxiety symptoms of 15 % . Exposure to particulate matter was characterized using estimated average exposure to particulate matter < 2.5 μm in diameter ( PM2.5 ) and 2.5 to 10 μm in diameter ( PM2.5 - 10 ) in the one month , three months , six months , one year , and 15 years prior to assessment of anxiety symptoms , and residential distance to the nearest major road two years prior to assessment . Significantly increased odds of high anxiety symptoms were observed with higher exposure to PM2.5 for multiple averaging periods ( for example , odds ratio per 10 µg/m(3 ) increase in prior one month average PM2.5 : 1.12 , 95 % confidence interval 1.06 to 1.19 ; in prior 12 month average PM2.5 : 1.15 , 1.06 to 1.26 ) . Models including multiple exposure windows suggested short term averaging periods were more relevant than long term averaging periods . There was no association between anxiety and exposure to PM2.5 - 10 . Residential proximity to major roads was not related to anxiety symptoms in a dose dependent manner . CONCLUSIONS Exposure to fine particulate matter ( PM2.5 ) was associated with high symptoms of anxiety , with more recent exposures potentially more relevant than more distant exposures .

DESIGN AND SETTING The Rotterdam Study , a population-based prospective cohort study conducted in the Netherlands .

64,64,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association of overall and specific headaches with volume of white matter hyperintensities , brain infarcts , and cognition . DESIGN Population based , cross sectional study . SETTING Epidemiology of Vascular Ageing study , Nantes , France . PARTICIPANTS 780 participants ( mean age 69 , 58.5 % women ) with detailed headache assessment . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Brain scans were evaluated for volume of white matter hyperintensities ( by fully automated imaging processing ) and for classification of infarcts ( by visual reading with a standardised assessment grid ) . Cognitive function was assessed by a battery of tests including the mini-mental state examination . RESULTS 163 ( 20.9 % ) participants reported a history of severe headache and 116 had migraine , of whom 17 ( 14.7 % ) reported aura symptoms . An association was found between any history of severe headache and increasing volume of white matter hyperintensities . The adjusted odds ratio of being in the highest third for total volume of white matter hyperintensities was 2.0 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.3 to 3.1 , P for trend 0.002 ) for participants with any history of severe headache when compared with participants without severe headache being in the lowest third . The association pattern was similar for all headache types . Migraine with aura was the only headache type strongly associated with volume of deep white matter hyperintensities ( highest third odds ratio 12.4 , 1.6 to 99.4 , P for trend 0.005 ) and with brain infarcts ( 3.4 , 1.2 to 9.3 ) . The location of infarcts was predominantly outside the cerebellum and brain stem . Evidence was lacking for cognitive impairment for any headache type with or without brain lesions .

DESIGN Population based , cross sectional study . SETTING Epidemiology of Vascular Ageing study , Nantes , France . PARTICIPANTS 780 participants ( mean age 69 , 58.5 % women ) with detailed headache assessment . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Brain scans were evaluated for volume of white matter hyperintensities ( by fully automated imaging processing ) and for classification of infarcts ( by visual reading with a standardised assessment grid ) . Cognitive function was assessed by a battery of tests including the mini-mental state examination . RESULTS 163 ( 20.9 % ) participants reported a history of severe headache and 116 had migraine , of whom 17 ( 14.7 % ) reported aura symptoms . An association was found between any history of severe headache and increasing volume of white matter hyperintensities . The adjusted odds ratio of being in the highest third for total volume of white matter hyperintensities was 2.0 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.3 to 3.1 , P for trend 0.002 ) for participants with any history of severe headache when compared with participants without severe headache being in the lowest third . The association pattern was similar for all headache types . Migraine with aura was the only headache type strongly associated with volume of deep white matter hyperintensities ( highest third odds ratio 12.4 , 1.6 to 99.4 , P for trend 0.005 ) and with brain infarcts ( 3.4 , 1.2 to 9.3 ) . The location of infarcts was predominantly outside the cerebellum and brain stem . CONCLUSIONS In this population based study , any history of severe headache was associated with an increased volume of white matter hyperintensities . Migraine with aura was the only headache type associated with brain infarcts . Evidence that headache of any type by itself or in combination with brain lesions was associated with cognitive impairment was lacking . </s> Headaches are not correlated with cognitive impairment.","(0, 46069, 21, 12622, 13, 14526, 18741, 13, 143, 19344, 1907, 19, 50, 396, 2900, 40841, 479, 1437, 2, 3928, 11322, 32, 45, 34852, 19, 14526, 18741, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,

One consequence of inactivity , low cardiorespiratory fitness , is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) morbidity and mortality , but the prevalence of cardiorespiratory fitness has not been quantified in representative US population samples . OBJECTIVES To describe the prevalence of low fitness in the US population aged 12 through 49 years and to relate low fitness to CVD risk factors in this population . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Inception cohort study using data from the cross-sectional nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999 - 2002 . Participants were adolescents ( aged 12 - 19 years ; n = 3110 ) and adults ( aged 20 - 49 years ; n = 2205 ) free from previously diagnosed CVD who underwent submaximal graded exercise treadmill testing to achieve at least 75 % to 90 % of their age-predicted maximum heart rate . Maximal oxygen consumption ( VO2max ) was estimated by measuring the heart rate response to reference levels of submaximal work . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Low fitness defined using percentile cut points of estimated VO2max from existing external referent populations ; anthropometric and other CVD risk factors measured according to standard methods . RESULTS Low fitness was identified in 33.6 % of adolescents ( approximately 7.5 million US adolescents ) and 13.9 % of adults ( approximately 8.5 million US adults ) ; the prevalence was similar in adolescent females ( 34.4 % ) and males ( 32.9 % ) ( P = .40 ) but was higher in adult females ( 16.2 % ) than in males ( 11.8 % ) ( P = .03 ) . Non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans were less fit than non-Hispanic whites . In all age-sex groups , body mass index and waist circumference were inversely associated with fitness ; age- and race-adjusted odds ratios of overweight or obesity ( body mass index > or = 25 ) ranged from 2.1 to 3.7 ( P<.01 for all ) , comparing persons with low fitness with those with moderate or high fitness . Total cholesterol levels and systolic blood pressure were higher and levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were lower among participants with low vs high fitness .

OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers in individuals with stable COPD are associated with an increased risk of having exacerbations . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective cohort study examining 61,650 participants with spirometry measurements from the Copenhagen City Heart Study ( 2001 - 2003 ) and the Copenhagen General Population Study ( 2003 - 2008 ) . Of these , 6574 had COPD , defined as a ratio between forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 ) and forced vital capacity below 0.7 . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Baseline levels of C-reactive protein ( CRP ) and fibrinogen and leukocyte count were measured in participants at a time when they were not experiencing symptoms of exacerbations . Exacerbations were recorded and defined as short-course treatment with oral corticosteroids alone or in combination with an antibiotic or as a hospital admission due to COPD . Levels of CRP and fibrinogen and leukocyte count were defined as high or low according to cut points of 3 mg/L , 14 μmol/L , and 9 ×10(9)/L , respectively . RESULTS During follow-up , 3083 exacerbations were recorded ( mean , 0.5/participant ) . In the first year of follow-up , multivariable-adjusted odds ratios for having frequent exacerbations were 1.2 ( 95 % CI , 0.7 - 2.2 ; 17 events/1000 person-years ) for individuals with 1 high biomarker , 1.7 ( 95 % CI , 0.9 - 3.2 ; 32 events/1000 person-years ) for individuals with 2 high biomarkers , and 3.7 ( 95 % CI , 1.9 - 7.4 ; 81 events/1000 person-years ) for individuals with 3 high biomarkers compared with individuals who had no elevated biomarkers ( 9 events/1000 person-years ; trend : P = 2 × 10(-5 ) ) . Corresponding hazard ratios using maximum follow-up time were 1.4 ( 95 % CI , 1.1 - 1.8 ) , 1.6 ( 95 % CI , 1.3 - 2.2 ) , and 2.5 ( 95 % CI , 1.8 - 3.4 ) , respectively ( trend : P = 1 × 10(-8 ) ) . The addition of inflammatory biomarkers to a basic model including age , sex , FEV1 percent predicted , smoking , use of any inhaled medication , body mass index , history of previous exacerbations , and time since most recent prior exacerbation improved the C statistics from 0.71 to 0.73 ( comparison : P = 9 × 10(-5 ) ) . Relative risks were consistent in those with milder COPD , in those with no history of frequent exacerbations , and in the 2 studies separately . The highest 5-year absolute risks of having frequent exacerbations in those with 3 high biomarkers ( vs no high biomarkers ) were 62 % ( vs 24 % ) for those with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ( GOLD ) grades C-D ( n = 558 ) , 98 % ( vs 64 % ) in those with a history of frequent exacerbations ( n = 127 ) , and 52 % ( vs 15 % ) for those with GOLD grades 3 - 4 ( n = 465 ) .

67,67,"OBJECTIVE To obtain summary estimates of the accuracy of a single baseline measurement of the Elecsys Troponin T high-sensitive assay ( Roche Diagnostics ) for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients presenting to the emergency department . DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy studies . DATA SOURCES Medline , Embase , and other relevant electronic databases were searched for papers published between January 2006 and December 2013 . STUDY SELECTION Studies were included if they evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of a single baseline measurement of Elecsys Troponin T high-sensitive assay for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected acute coronary syndrome . STUDY APPRAISAL AND DATA SYNTHESIS The first author screened all titles and abstracts identified through the searches and selected all potentially relevant papers . The screening of the full texts , the data extraction , and the methodological quality assessment , using the adapted QUADAS-2 tool , were conducted independently by two reviewers with disagreements being resolved through discussion or arbitration . If appropriate , meta-analysis was conducted using the hierarchical bivariate model . RESULTS Twenty three studies reported the performance of the evaluated assay at presentation . The results for 14 ng/L and 3 - 5 ng/L cut-off values were pooled separately . At 14 ng/L ( 20 papers ) , the summary sensitivity was 89.5 % ( 95 % confidence interval 86.3 % to 92.1 % ) and the summary specificity was 77.1 % ( 68.7 % to 83.7 % ) . At 3 - 5 ng/L ( six papers ) , the summary sensitivity was 97.4 % ( 94.9 % to 98.7 % ) and the summary specificity was 42.4 % ( 31.2 % to 54.5 % ) . This means that if 21 of 100 consecutive patients have the target condition ( 21 % , the median prevalence across the studies ) , 2 ( 95 % confidence interval 2 to 3 ) of 21 patients with acute myocardial infarction will be missed ( false negatives ) if 14 ng/L is used as a cut-off value and 18 ( 13 to 25 ) of 79 patients without acute myocardial infarction will test positive ( false positives ) . If the 3 - 5 ng/L cut-off value is used , < 1 ( 0 to 1 ) patient with acute myocardial infarction will be missed and 46 ( 36 to 54 ) patients without acute myocardial infarction will test positive . CONCLUSIONS The results indicate that a single baseline measurement of the Elecsys Troponin T high-sensitive assay could be used to rule out acute myocardial infarction if lower cut-off values such as 3 ng/L or 5 ng/L are used . However , this method should be part of a comprehensive triage strategy and may not be appropriate for patients who present less than three hours after symptom onset . Care must also be exercised because of the higher imprecision of the evaluated assay and the greater effect of lot-to-lot reagent variation at low troponin concentrations .

PATIENTS 157 Patients ( mean age 66.6 ( SD 8.2 ) years ) , 113 with patent grafts and 44 with occluded grafts one year after bypass . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Cumulative percentage patency at one year . RESULTS Markers for smoking ( blood carboxyhaemoglobin concentration ( p less than 0.05 ) and plasma thiocyanate concentration ( p less than 0.01 ) and plasma concentrations of fibrinogen ( p less than 0.001 ) and apolipoproteins AI ( p less than 0.04 ) and ( a ) ( p less than 0.05 ) were significantly higher in patients with occluded grafts . Serum cholesterol concentrations were significantly higher in patients with grafts that remained patent one year after bypass ( p less than 0.005 ) . Analysis of the smoking markers indicated that a quarter of patients ( 40 ) were untruthful in their claims to have stopped smoking . Based on smoking markers , patency of grafts in smokers was significantly lower at one year by life table analysis than in non-smokers ( 63 % v 84 % , p less than 0.02 ) . Patency was significantly higher by life table analysis in patients with a plasma fibrinogen concentration below the median than in those with a concentration above ( 90 % v 57 % , p less than 0.0002 ) . Surprisingly , increased plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was significantly associated with improved patency at one year ( 85 % ) at values above the median compared with patency ( only 68 % ) at values in the lower half of the range ( p less than 0.02 ) .

PATIENTS 157 Patients ( mean age 66.6 ( SD 8.2 ) years ) , 113 with patent grafts and 44 with occluded grafts one year after bypass . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Cumulative percentage patency at one year . RESULTS Markers for smoking ( blood carboxyhaemoglobin concentration ( p less than 0.05 ) and plasma thiocyanate concentration ( p less than 0.01 ) and plasma concentrations of fibrinogen ( p less than 0.001 ) and apolipoproteins AI ( p less than 0.04 ) and ( a ) ( p less than 0.05 ) were significantly higher in patients with occluded grafts . Serum cholesterol concentrations were significantly higher in patients with grafts that remained patent one year after bypass ( p less than 0.005 ) . Analysis of the smoking markers indicated that a quarter of patients ( 40 ) were untruthful in their claims to have stopped smoking . Based on smoking markers , patency of grafts in smokers was significantly lower at one year by life table analysis than in non-smokers ( 63 % v 84 % , p less than 0.02 ) . Patency was significantly higher by life table analysis in patients with a plasma fibrinogen concentration below the median than in those with a concentration above ( 90 % v 57 % , p less than 0.0002 ) . Surprisingly , increased plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was significantly associated with improved patency at one year ( 85 % ) at values above the median compared with patency ( only 68 % ) at values in the lower half of the range ( p less than 0.02 ) .

73,73,"CONTEXT Although acute hypoglycemia may be associated with cognitive impairment in children with type 1 diabetes , no studies to date have evaluated whether hypoglycemia is a risk factor for dementia in older patients with type 2 diabetes . OBJECTIVE To determine if hypoglycemic episodes severe enough to require hospitalization are associated with an increased risk of dementia in a population of older patients with type 2 diabetes followed up for 27 years . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PATIENTS A longitudinal cohort study from 1980 - 2007 of 16,667 patients with a mean age of 65 years and type 2 diabetes who are members of an integrated health care delivery system in northern California . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Hypoglycemic events from 1980 - 2002 were collected and reviewed using hospital discharge and emergency department diagnoses . Cohort members with no prior diagnoses of dementia , mild cognitive impairment , or general memory complaints as of January 1 , 2003 , were followed up for a dementia diagnosis through January 15 , 2007 . Dementia risk was examined using Cox proportional hazard regression models , adjusted for age , sex , race/ethnicity , education , body mass index , duration of diabetes , 7-year mean glycated hemoglobin , diabetes treatment , duration of insulin use , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , cardiovascular disease , stroke , transient cerebral ischemia , and end-stage renal disease . RESULTS At least 1 episode of hypoglycemia was diagnosed in 1465 patients ( 8.8 % ) and dementia was diagnosed in 1822 patients ( 11 % ) during follow-up ; 250 patients had both dementia and at least 1 episode of hypoglycemia ( 16.95 % ) . Compared with patients with no hypoglycemia , patients with single or multiple episodes had a graded increase in risk with fully adjusted hazard ratios ( HRs ) : for 1 episode ( HR , 1.26 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.10 - 1.49 ) ; 2 episodes ( HR , 1.80 ; 95 % CI , 1.37 - 2.36 ) ; and 3 or more episodes ( HR , 1.94 ; 95 % CI , 1.42 - 2.64 ) . The attributable risk of dementia between individuals with and without a history of hypoglycemia was 2.39 % per year ( 95 % CI , 1.72%-3.01 % ) . Results were not attenuated when medical utilization rates , length of health plan membership , or time since initial diabetes diagnosis were added to the model . When examining emergency department admissions for hypoglycemia for association with risk of dementia ( 535 episodes ) , results were similar ( compared with patients with 0 episodes ) with fully adjusted HRs : for 1 episode ( HR , 1.42 ; 95 % CI , 1.12 - 1.78 ) and for 2 or more episodes ( HR , 2.36 ; 95 % CI , 1.57 - 3.55 ) .

OBJECTIVE To determine if hypoglycemic episodes severe enough to require hospitalization are associated with an increased risk of dementia in a population of older patients with type 2 diabetes followed up for 27 years . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PATIENTS A longitudinal cohort study from 1980 - 2007 of 16,667 patients with a mean age of 65 years and type 2 diabetes who are members of an integrated health care delivery system in northern California . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Hypoglycemic events from 1980 - 2002 were collected and reviewed using hospital discharge and emergency department diagnoses . Cohort members with no prior diagnoses of dementia , mild cognitive impairment , or general memory complaints as of January 1 , 2003 , were followed up for a dementia diagnosis through January 15 , 2007 . Dementia risk was examined using Cox proportional hazard regression models , adjusted for age , sex , race/ethnicity , education , body mass index , duration of diabetes , 7-year mean glycated hemoglobin , diabetes treatment , duration of insulin use , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , cardiovascular disease , stroke , transient cerebral ischemia , and end-stage renal disease .

74,74,"The importance of neuropeptides in the hypothalamus has been experimentally established . Due to difficulties in assessing function in vivo , the roles of the fast-acting neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA are largely unknown . Synaptic vesicular transporters ( VGLUTs for glutamate and VGAT for GABA ) are required for vesicular uptake and , consequently , synaptic release of neurotransmitters . Ventromedial hypothalamic ( VMH ) neurons are predominantly glutamatergic and express VGLUT2 . To evaluate the role of glutamate release from VMH neurons , we generated mice lacking VGLUT2 selectively in SF1 neurons ( a major subset of VMH neurons ) . These mice have hypoglycemia during fasting secondary to impaired fasting-induced increases in the glucose-raising pancreatic hormone glucagon and impaired induction in liver of mRNAs encoding PGC-1alpha and the gluconeogenic enzymes PEPCK and G6Pase .

Due to difficulties in assessing function in vivo , the roles of the fast-acting neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA are largely unknown . Synaptic vesicular transporters ( VGLUTs for glutamate and VGAT for GABA ) are required for vesicular uptake and , consequently , synaptic release of neurotransmitters . Ventromedial hypothalamic ( VMH ) neurons are predominantly glutamatergic and express VGLUT2 . To evaluate the role of glutamate release from VMH neurons , we generated mice lacking VGLUT2 selectively in SF1 neurons ( a major subset of VMH neurons ) .

76,76,"It is unclear how the immune response in early life becomes appropriately stimulated to provide protection while also avoiding excessive activation as a result of diverse new antigens . T cells are integral to adaptive immunity ; mouse studies indicate that tissue localization of T cell subsets is important for both protective immunity and immunoregulation . In humans , however , the early development and function of T cells in tissues remain unexplored . We present here an analysis of lymphoid and mucosal tissue T cells derived from pediatric organ donors in the first two years of life , as compared to adult organ donors , revealing early compartmentalization of T cell differentiation and regulation .

78,78,"CONTEXT More than 1.5 million US adults use stimulants and other medications labeled for treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) . These agents can increase heart rate and blood pressure , raising concerns about their cardiovascular safety . OBJECTIVE To examine whether current use of medications prescribed primarily to treat ADHD is associated with increased risk of serious cardiovascular events in young and middle-aged adults . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective , population-based cohort study using electronic health care records from 4 study sites ( OptumInsight Epidemiology , Tennessee Medicaid , Kaiser Permanente California , and the HMO Research Network ) , starting in 1986 at 1 site and ending in 2005 at all sites , with additional covariate assessment using 2007 survey data . Participants were adults aged 25 through 64 years with dispensed prescriptions for methylphenidate , amphetamine , or atomoxetine at baseline . Each medication user ( n = 150,359 ) was matched to 2 nonusers on study site , birth year , sex , and calendar year ( 443,198 total users and nonusers ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Serious cardiovascular events , including myocardial infarction ( MI ) , sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) , or stroke , with comparison between current or new users and remote users to account for potential healthy-user bias . RESULTS During 806,182 person-years of follow-up ( median , 1.3 years per person ) , 1357 cases of MI , 296 cases of SCD , and 575 cases of stroke occurred . There were 107,322 person-years of current use ( median , 0.33 years ) , with a crude incidence per 1000 person-years of 1.34 ( 95 % CI , 1.14 - 1.57 ) for MI , 0.30 ( 95 % CI , 0.20 - 0.42 ) for SCD , and 0.56 ( 95 % CI , 0.43 - 0.72 ) for stroke . The multivariable-adjusted rate ratio ( RR ) of serious cardiovascular events for current use vs nonuse of ADHD medications was 0.83 ( 95 % CI , 0.72 - 0.96 ) . Among new users of ADHD medications , the adjusted RR was 0.77 ( 95 % CI , 0.63 - 0.94 ) . The adjusted RR for current use vs remote use was 1.03 ( 95 % CI , 0.86 - 1.24 ) ; for new use vs remote use , the adjusted RR was 1.02 ( 95 % CI , 0.82 - 1.28 ) ; the upper limit of 1.28 corresponds to an additional 0.19 events per 1000 person-years at ages 25 - 44 years and 0.77 events per 1000 person-years at ages 45 - 64 years . CONCLUSIONS Among young and middle-aged adults , current or new use of ADHD medications , compared with nonuse or remote use , was not associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events .

DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Population-based cohort study using the resources of the Rochester Epidemiology Project conducted in Olmsted County , Minnesota . Patients were 4537 Olmsted County residents ( 57 % women ; mean [ SD ] age , 74 [ 14 ] years ) with a diagnosis of heart failure between 1979 and 2000 . Framingham criteria and clinical criteria were used to validate the diagnosis MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Incidence of heart failure and survival after heart failure diagnosis . RESULTS The incidence of heart failure was higher among men ( 378/100 000 persons ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 361 - 395 for men ; 289/100 000 persons ; 95 % CI , 277 - 300 for women ) and did not change over time among men or women .

80,80,"The number of women dying from cervical cancer in 1997 was 7 % lower than in 1996 and has fallen by over 25 % since 1992.1 Such rapid change must be at least partly due to cervical screening , although strong cohort effects have caused large fluctuations in cervical mortality in the past.2 We modelled mortality data , taking into account the effects of age and year of birth and looking for trends in time within four age groups to estimate the beneficial effects of cervical screening . We obtained mortality data , in 5 year age bands , from death registrations in England and Wales and calculated rates using mid-year population estimates . Mortality since 1993 was adjusted upwards by 4 % because of changes in classification of cause of death.3 We modelled the data assuming that the age specific mortality is the product of a smoothly varying age effect , birth cohort effect , and age dependent … With respect to cervical cancer management , Finland and the Netherlands are comparable in relevant characteristics , e.g. , fertility rate , age-of-mother at first birth and a national screening programme for several years . The aim of this study is to compare trends in incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer in Finland and the Netherlands in relation to the introduction and intensity of the screening programmes . Therefore , incidence and mortality rates were calculated using the Cancer Registries of Finland and the Netherlands . Data on screening intensity were obtained from the Finnish Cancer Registry and the Dutch evaluation centre at ErasmusMC-Rotterdam . Women aged 30 - 60 have been screened every 5 years , in Finland since 1992 and in the Netherlands since 1996 . Screening protocols for smear taking and referral to the gynaecologist are comparable . Incidence and mortality rates have declined more in Finland . In 2003 , age-adjusted incidence and mortality in Finland were 4.0 and 0.9 and in the Netherlands 4.9 and 1.4 per 100,000 woman-years , respectively . Excess smear use in the Netherlands was estimated to be 24 per 1,000 women during a 5-year interval compared to 121 in Finland . The decline in mortality in Finland seems to be almost completely related to the screening programme whereas in the Netherlands it was initially considered to be a natural decline . Differences in risk factors might also play a role : the Netherlands has higher population density and higher percentages of immigrants and ( female ) smokers . The greater excess smear use in Finland might also have affected incidence . OBJECTIVE To describe the efficacy of the Finnish mass screening program for cervical squamous carcinoma and adenocarcinoma , as reflected by changes of incidence and mortality rate . METHODS Cervical cancer incidence and mortality data were obtained from the Finnish Cancer Registry . Data were available from the year 1953 , when the registry was established . The nationwide mass screening program in Finland was started in the mid-1960s . A centralized organization administers this program . Women age 30 - 60 years are notified for screening every 5 years . RESULTS The mean incidence of cervical carcinoma in the early 1960s was 15.4 per 10(5 ) woman-years . In 1991 , it was only 2.7 per 10(5 ) woman-years . The mortality rate has decreased in the same proportion since the mass screening program .

Mortality since 1993 was adjusted upwards by is the product of a smoothly varying age effect , </s> Incidence rates of cervical cancer have decreased.","We obtained mortality 4 % because of changes in classification of cause of death.3 We modelled the data assuming that the age specific mortality birth cohort effect , and age dependent … With respect to cervical cancer management , Finland and the Netherlands are comparable in relevant characteristics , e.g. , fertility rate , age-of-mother at first birth and a national screening programme for several years . The aim of this study is to compare trends in incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer in Finland and the Netherlands in relation to the introduction and intensity of the screening programmes . Therefore , incidence and mortality rates were calculated using the Cancer Registries of Finland and the Netherlands . Data on screening intensity were obtained from the Finnish Cancer Registry and the Dutch evaluation centre at ErasmusMC-Rotterdam . Women aged 30 - 60 have been screened every 5 years , in Finland since 1992 and in the Netherlands since 1996 . Screening protocols for smear taking and referral to the gynaecologist are comparable . Incidence and mortality rates have declined more in Finland . In 2003 , age-adjusted incidence and mortality in Finland were 4.0 and 0.9 and in the Netherlands 4.9 and 1.4 per 100,000 woman-years , respectively . Excess smear use in the Netherlands was estimated to be 24 per 1,000 women during a 5-year interval compared to 121 in Finland . The decline in mortality in Finland seems to be almost completely related to the screening programme whereas in the Netherlands it was initially considered to be a natural decline . Differences in risk factors might also play a role : the Netherlands has higher population density and higher percentages of immigrants and ( female ) smokers . The greater excess smear use in Finland might also have affected incidence . OBJECTIVE To describe the efficacy of the Finnish mass screening program for cervical squamous carcinoma and adenocarcinoma , as reflected by changes of incidence and mortality rate . METHODS Cervical cancer incidence and mortality data were obtained from the Finnish Cancer Registry . Data were available from the year 1953 , when the registry was established . The nationwide mass screening program in Finland was started in the mid-1960s . A centralized organization administers this program . Women age 30 - 60 years are notified for screening every 5 years . RESULTS The mean incidence of cervical carcinoma in the early 1960s was 15.4 per 10(5 ) woman-years . In 1991 , it was only 2.7 per 10(5 ) woman-years . The mortality rate has decreased in the same proportion since the mass screening program . In the early 1960s , the mortality was 6.6 and in 1991 1.4 per 10(5 ) woman-years . However , the decrease of the incidence is seen almost exclusively in squamous cell carcinomas . The mortality caused by adenocarcinoma has decreased in screened birth cohorts , but the incidence rate has remained the same .

81,81,"With respect to cervical cancer management , Finland and the Netherlands are comparable in relevant characteristics , e.g. , fertility rate , age-of-mother at first birth and a national screening programme for several years . The aim of this study is to compare trends in incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer in Finland and the Netherlands in relation to the introduction and intensity of the screening programmes . Therefore , incidence and mortality rates were calculated using the Cancer Registries of Finland and the Netherlands . Data on screening intensity were obtained from the Finnish Cancer Registry and the Dutch evaluation centre at ErasmusMC-Rotterdam . Women aged 30 - 60 have been screened every 5 years , in Finland since 1992 and in the Netherlands since 1996 . Screening protocols for smear taking and referral to the gynaecologist are comparable . Incidence and mortality rates have declined more in Finland . In 2003 , age-adjusted incidence and mortality in Finland were 4.0 and 0.9 and in the Netherlands 4.9 and 1.4 per 100,000 woman-years , respectively . Excess smear use in the Netherlands was estimated to be 24 per 1,000 women during a 5-year interval compared to 121 in Finland .

The decline in mortality in Finland seems to be almost completely related to the screening programme whereas in the Netherlands it was initially considered to be a natural decline . </s> Incidence rates of cervical cancer have increased due to nationwide screening programs based primarily on cytology to detect uterine cervical cancer.,"With respect to cervical cancer management , Finland and the Netherlands are comparable in relevant characteristics , e.g. , fertility rate , age-of-mother at first birth and a national screening programme for several years . The aim of this study is to compare trends in incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer in Finland and the Netherlands in relation to the introduction and intensity of the screening programmes . Therefore , incidence and mortality rates were calculated using the Cancer Registries of Finland and the Netherlands . Data on screening intensity were obtained from the Finnish Cancer Registry and the Dutch evaluation centre at ErasmusMC-Rotterdam . Women aged 30 - 60 have been screened every 5 years , in Finland since 1992 and in the Netherlands since 1996 . Screening protocols for smear taking and referral to the gynaecologist are comparable . In 2003 , age-adjusted incidence and mortality in Finland were 4.0 and 0.9 and in the Netherlands 4.9 and 1.4 per 100,000 woman-years , respectively . Excess smear use in the Netherlands was estimated to be 24 per 1,000 women during a 5-year interval compared to 121 in Finland .

85,85,"CONTEXT Insomnia is a common condition in older adults and is associated with a number of adverse medical , social , and psychological consequences . Previous research has suggested beneficial outcomes of both psychological and pharmacological treatments , but blinded placebo-controlled trials comparing the effects of these treatments are lacking . OBJECTIVE To examine short- and long-term clinical efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) and pharmacological treatment in older adults experiencing chronic primary insomnia . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial of 46 adults ( mean age , 60.8 y ; 22 women ) with chronic primary insomnia conducted between January 2004 and December 2005 in a single Norwegian university-based outpatient clinic for adults and elderly patients . INTERVENTION CBT ( sleep hygiene , sleep restriction , stimulus control , cognitive therapy , and relaxation ; n = 18 ) , sleep medication ( 7.5-mg zopiclone each night ; n = 16 ) , or placebo medication ( n = 12 ) . All treatment duration was 6 weeks , and the 2 active treatments were followed up at 6 months . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Ambulant clinical polysomnographic data and sleep diaries were used to determine total wake time , total sleep time , sleep efficiency , and slow-wave sleep ( only assessed using polysomnography ) on all 3 assessment points . RESULTS CBT resulted in improved short- and long-term outcomes compared with zopiclone on 3 out of 4 outcome measures . For most outcomes , zopiclone did not differ from placebo . Participants receiving CBT improved their sleep efficiency from 81.4 % at pretreatment to 90.1 % at 6-month follow-up compared with a decrease from 82.3 % to 81.9 % in the zopiclone group . Participants in the CBT group spent much more time in slow-wave sleep ( stages 3 and 4 ) compared with those in other groups , and spent less time awake during the night . Total sleep time was similar in all 3 groups ; at 6 months , patients receiving CBT had better sleep efficiency using polysomnography than those taking zopiclone .

Improved understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie the metabolism and regulation of LDL cholesterol might help to identify novel therapeutic targets . We therefore did a genome-wide association study of LDL-cholesterol concentrations . METHODS We used genome-wide association data from up to 11,685 participants with measures of circulating LDL-cholesterol concentrations across five studies , including data for 293 461 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) with a minor allele frequency of 5 % or more that passed our quality control criteria . We also used data from a second genome-wide array in up to 4337 participants from three of these five studies , with data for 290,140 SNPs . We did replication studies in two independent populations consisting of up to 4979 participants . Statistical approaches , including meta-analysis and linkage disequilibrium plots , were used to refine association signals ; we analysed pooled data from all seven populations to determine the effect of each SNP on variations in circulating LDL-cholesterol concentrations . FINDINGS In our initial scan , we found two SNPs ( rs599839 [ p=1.7x10(-15 ) ] and rs4970834 [ p=3.0x10(-11 ) ] ) that showed genome-wide statistical association with LDL cholesterol at chromosomal locus 1p13.3 . The second genome screen found a third statistically associated SNP at the same locus ( rs646776 [ p=4.3x10(-9 ) ] ) . Meta-analysis of data from all studies showed an association of SNPs rs599839 ( combined p=1.2x10(-33 ) ) and rs646776 ( p=4.8x10(-20 ) ) with LDL-cholesterol concentrations . SNPs rs599839 and rs646776 both explained around 1 % of the variation in circulating LDL-cholesterol concentrations and were associated with about 15 % of an SD change in LDL cholesterol per allele , assuming an SD of 1 mmol/L. INTERPRETATION We found evidence for a novel locus for LDL cholesterol on chromosome 1p13.3 .

OBJECTIVE To evaluate clinical outcomes following adoption of a national universal prestorage leukoreduction program for blood transfusions . DESIGN , SETTING , AND POPULATION Retrospective before-and-after cohort study conducted from August 1998 to August 2000 in 23 academic and community hospitals throughout Canada , enrolling 14 786 patients who received red blood cell transfusions following cardiac surgery or repair of hip fracture , or who required intensive care following a surgical intervention or multiple trauma . INTERVENTION Universal prestorage leukoreduction program introduced by 2 Canadian blood agencies . A total of 6982 patients were enrolled during the control period and 7804 patients were enrolled following prestorage leukoreduction . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES All-cause in-hospital mortality and serious nosocomial infections ( pneumonia , bacteremia , septic shock , all surgical site infections ) occurring after first transfusion and at least 2 days after index procedure or intensive care unit admission . Secondary outcomes included rates of posttransfusion fever and antibiotic use . RESULTS Unadjusted in-hospital mortality rates were significantly lower following the introduction of leukoreduction compared with the control period ( 6.19 % vs 7.03 % , respectively ; P = .04 ) . Compared with the control period , the adjusted odds of death following leukoreduction were reduced ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 0.87 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.75 - 0.99 ) , but serious nosocomial infections did not decrease ( adjusted OR , 0.97 ; 95 % CI , 0.87 - 1.09 ) . The frequency of posttransfusion fevers decreased significantly following leukoreduction ( adjusted OR , 0.86 ; 95 % CI , 0.79 - 0.94 ) , as did antibiotic use ( adjusted OR , 0.90 ; 95 % CI , 0.82 - 0.99 ) .

A total of 6982 patients were enrolled during the control period and 7804 patients were enrolled following prestorage leukoreduction . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES All-cause in-hospital mortality and serious nosocomial infections ( pneumonia , bacteremia , septic shock , all surgical site infections ) occurring after first transfusion and at least 2 days after index procedure or intensive care unit admission . Secondary outcomes included rates of posttransfusion fever and antibiotic use . RESULTS Unadjusted in-hospital mortality rates were significantly lower following the introduction of leukoreduction compared with the control period ( 6.19 % vs 7.03 % , respectively ; P = .04 ) . </s> Leuko-increased blood increases infectious complications in red blood cell transfusion.","(0, 44891, 19, 5, 797, 675, 2156, 5, 5493, 5995, 9, 744, 511, 2084, 1350, 1688, 42705, 58, 2906, 36,

90,90,"Research on the human microbiome has established that commensal and pathogenic bacteria can influence obesity , cancer , and autoimmunity through mechanisms mostly unknown . We found that a component of bacterial biofilms , the amyloid protein curli , irreversibly formed fibers with bacterial DNA during biofilm formation . This interaction accelerated amyloid polymerization and created potent immunogenic complexes that activated immune cells , including dendritic cells , to produce cytokines such as type I interferons , which are pathogenic in systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) .

92,92,"Blood monocytes are well-characterized precursors for macrophages and dendritic cells . Subsets of human monocytes with differential representation in various disease states are well known . In contrast , mouse monocyte subsets have been characterized minimally . In this study we identify three subpopulations of mouse monocytes that can be distinguished by differential expression of Ly-6C , CD43 , CD11c , MBR , and CD62L . The subsets share the characteristics of extensive phagocytosis , similar expression of M-CSF receptor ( CD115 ) , and development into macrophages upon M-CSF stimulation . By eliminating blood monocytes with dichloromethylene-bisphosphonate-loaded liposomes and monitoring their repopulation , we showed a developmental relationship between the subsets . Monocytes were maximally depleted 18 h after liposome application and subsequently reappeared in the circulation . These cells were exclusively of the Ly-6C(high ) subset , resembling bone marrow monocytes . Serial flow cytometric analyses of newly released Ly-6C(high ) monocytes showed that Ly-6C expression on these cells was down-regulated while in circulation .

Subsets of human monocytes with differential representation in various disease states are well known . In contrast , mouse monocyte subsets have been characterized minimally . In this study we identify three subpopulations of mouse monocytes that can be distinguished by differential expression of Ly-6C , CD43 , CD11c , MBR , and CD62L . The subsets share the characteristics of extensive phagocytosis , similar expression of M-CSF receptor ( CD115 ) , and development into macrophages upon M-CSF stimulation . By eliminating blood monocytes with dichloromethylene-bisphosphonate-loaded liposomes and monitoring their repopulation , we showed a developmental relationship between the subsets . Monocytes were maximally depleted 18 h after liposome application and subsequently reappeared in the circulation . These cells were exclusively of the Ly-6C(high ) subset , resembling bone marrow monocytes . Serial flow cytometric analyses of newly released Ly-6C(high ) monocytes showed that Ly-6C expression on these cells was down-regulated while in circulation . Taken together , these data identify distinct subpopulations of mouse blood monocytes that differ in maturation stage and capacity to become recruited to inflammatory sites . </s> Ly6C hi monocytes

95,95,"CONTEXT Increasing evidence supports the hypothesis of a causal association between certain bacterial infections and increased risk of developing acute myocardial infarction . If such a causal association exists , subjects who used antibiotics active against the bacteria , regardless of indication , might be at lower risk of developing acute myocardial infarction than nonusers . OBJECTIVE To determine whether previous use of antibiotics decreases the risk of developing a first-time acute myocardial infarction . DESIGN Population-based case-control analysis . SETTING The United Kingdom-based General Practice Research Database comprising 350 general practices . PATIENTS A total of 3315 case patients aged 75 years or younger with a diagnosis of first-time acute myocardial infarction between 1992 and 1997 and 13139 controls without myocardial infarction matched to cases for age , sex , general practice attended , and calendar time . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Use of antibiotics among those who did or did not have a first-time acute myocardial infarction . RESULTS Cases were significantly less likely to have used tetracycline antibiotics ( adjusted odds ratio [ OR ] , 0.70 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.55 - 0.90 ) or quinolones ( adjusted OR , 0.45 ; 95 % CI , 0.21 - 0.95 ) . No effect was found for previous use of macrolides ( primarily erythromycin ) , sulfonamides , penicillins , or cephalosporins .

If such a causal association exists , subjects who used antibiotics active against the bacteria , regardless of indication , might be at lower risk of developing acute myocardial infarction than nonusers . OBJECTIVE To determine whether previous use of antibiotics decreases the risk of developing a first-time acute myocardial infarction . DESIGN Population-based case-control analysis . SETTING The United Kingdom-based General Practice Research Database comprising 350 general practices . PATIENTS A total of 3315 case patients aged 75 years or younger with a diagnosis of first-time acute myocardial infarction between 1992 and 1997 and 13139 controls without myocardial infarction matched to cases for age , sex , general practice attended , and calendar time . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Use of antibiotics among those who did or did not have a first-time acute myocardial infarction . RESULTS Cases were significantly less likely to have used tetracycline antibiotics ( adjusted odds ratio [ OR ] , 0.70 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.55 - 0.90 ) or quinolones ( adjusted OR , 0.45 ; 95 % CI , 0.21 - 0.95 ) .

98,98,"BACKGROUND Artemisinin derivatives used in recently introduced combination therapies ( ACTs ) for Plasmodium falciparum malaria significantly lower patient infectiousness and have the potential to reduce population-level transmission of the parasite . With the increased interest in malaria elimination , understanding the impact on transmission of ACT and other antimalarial drugs with different pharmacodynamics becomes a key issue . This study estimates the reduction in transmission that may be achieved by introducing different types of treatment for symptomatic P. falciparum malaria in endemic areas . METHODS AND FINDINGS We developed a mathematical model to predict the potential impact on transmission outcomes of introducing ACT as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in six areas of varying transmission intensity in Tanzania . We also estimated the impact that could be achieved by antimalarials with different efficacy , prophylactic time , and gametocytocidal effects . Rates of treatment , asymptomatic infection , and symptomatic infection in the six study areas were estimated using the model together with data from a cross-sectional survey of 5,667 individuals conducted prior to policy change from sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine to ACT . The effects of ACT and other drug types on gametocytaemia and infectiousness to mosquitoes were independently estimated from clinical trial data . Predicted percentage reductions in prevalence of infection and incidence of clinical episodes achieved by ACT were highest in the areas with low initial transmission . A 53 % reduction in prevalence of infection was seen if 100 % of current treatment was switched to ACT in the area where baseline slide-prevalence of parasitaemia was lowest ( 3.7 % ) , compared to an 11 % reduction in the highest-transmission setting ( baseline slide prevalence = 57.1 % ) . Estimated percentage reductions in incidence of clinical episodes were similar . The absolute size of the public health impact , however , was greater in the highest-transmission area , with 54 clinical episodes per 100 persons per year averted compared to five per 100 persons per year in the lowest-transmission area . High coverage was important . Reducing presumptive treatment through improved diagnosis substantially reduced the number of treatment courses required per clinical episode averted in the lower-transmission settings although there was some loss of overall impact on transmission . An efficacious antimalarial regimen with no specific gametocytocidal properties but a long prophylactic time was estimated to be more effective at reducing transmission than a short-acting ACT in the highest-transmission setting . CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that ACTs have the potential for transmission reductions approaching those achieved by insecticide-treated nets in lower-transmission settings . ACT partner drugs and nonartemisinin regimens with longer prophylactic times could result in a larger impact in higher-transmission settings , although their long term benefit must be evaluated in relation to the risk of development of parasite resistance .  </s> Mathematical models predict that using Artemisinin-based combination therapy over nongametocytocidal drugs have a dramatic impact in reducing malaria transmission.",REFUTES,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Mathematical models predict that using Artemisinin-based combination therapy over nongametocytocidal drugs have a dramatic impact in reducing malaria transmission.,An efficacious antimalarial regimen with no specific gametocytocidal properties but a long prophylactic time was estimated to be more effective at reducing transmission than a short-acting ACT in the highest-transmission setting . </s> Mathematical models predict that using Artemisinin-based combination therapy over nongametocytocidal drugs have a dramatic impact in reducing malaria transmission.,"BACKGROUND Artemisinin derivatives used in recently introduced combination therapies ( ACTs ) for Plasmodium falciparum malaria significantly lower patient infectiousness and have the potential to reduce population-level transmission of the parasite .

The effects of ACT and other drug types on gametocytaemia and infectiousness to mosquitoes were independently estimated from clinical trial data . Predicted percentage reductions in prevalence of infection and incidence of clinical episodes achieved by ACT were highest in the areas with low initial transmission . A 53 % reduction in prevalence of infection was seen if 100 % of current treatment was switched to ACT in the area where baseline slide-prevalence of parasitaemia was lowest ( 3.7 % ) , compared to an 11 % reduction in the highest-transmission setting ( baseline slide prevalence = 57.1 % ) . Estimated percentage reductions in incidence of clinical episodes were similar . The absolute size of the public health impact , however , was greater in the highest-transmission area , with 54 clinical episodes per 100 persons per year averted compared to five per 100 persons per year in the lowest-transmission area . High coverage was important . Reducing presumptive treatment through improved diagnosis substantially reduced the number of treatment courses required per clinical episode averted in the lower-transmission settings although there was some loss of overall impact on transmission . CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that ACTs have the potential for transmission reductions approaching those achieved by insecticide-treated nets in lower-transmission settings . ACT partner drugs and nonartemisinin regimens with longer prophylactic times could result in a larger impact in higher-transmission settings , although their long term benefit must be evaluated in relation to the risk of development of parasite resistance . </s> Mathematical models predict that using Artemisinin-based combination therapy over nongametocytocidal drugs have a dramatic impact in reducing malaria transmission.","(0, 4688, 20995, 15525, 9876, 16980, 27774, 30174, 19, 117, 2167, 20577, 594, 30321, 40105, 11934, 3611, 53, 10, 251, 1759, 3792, 4360, 28201, 86, 21, 2319, 7, 28, 55,

99,99,"BACKGROUND Elderly and frail patients with cancer , although often treated with chemotherapy , are under-represented in clinical trials . We designed FOCUS2 to investigate reduced-dose chemotherapy options and to seek objective predictors of outcome in frail patients with advanced colorectal cancer . METHODS We undertook an open , 2 × 2 factorial trial in 61 UK centres for patients with previously untreated advanced colorectal cancer who were considered unfit for full-dose chemotherapy . After comprehensive health assessment ( CHA ) , patients were randomly assigned by minimisation to : 48-h intravenous fluorouracil with levofolinate ( group A ) ; oxaliplatin and fluorouracil ( group B ) ; capecitabine ( group C ) ; or oxaliplatin and capecitabine ( group D ) . Treatment allocation was not masked . Starting doses were 80 % of standard doses , with discretionary escalation to full dose after 6 weeks . The two primary outcome measures were : addition of oxaliplatin ( [ A vs B ] + [ C vs D ] ) , assessed with progression-free survival ( PFS ) ; and substitution of fluorouracil with capecitabine ( [ A vs C ] + [ B vs D ] ) , assessed by change from baseline to 12 weeks in global quality of life ( QoL ) . Analysis was by intention to treat . Baseline clinical and CHA data were modelled against outcomes with a novel composite measure , overall treatment utility ( OTU ) . This study is registered , number ISRCTN21221452 . FINDINGS 459 patients were randomly assigned ( 115 to each of groups A-C , 114 to group D ) . Factorial comparison of addition of oxaliplatin versus no addition suggested some improvement in PFS , but the finding was not significant ( median 5·8 months [ IQR 3·3 - 7·5 ] vs 4·5 months [ 2·8 - 6·4 ] ; hazard ratio 0·84 , 95 % CI 0·69 - 1·01 , p=0·07 ) . Replacement of fluorouracil with capecitabine did not improve global QoL : 69 of 124 ( 56 % ) patients receiving fluorouracil reported improvement in global QoL compared with 69 of 123 ( 56 % ) receiving capecitabine . The risk of having any grade 3 or worse toxic effect was not significantly increased with oxaliplatin ( 83/219 [ 38 % ] vs 70/221 [ 32 % ] ; p=0·17 ) , but was higher with capecitabine than with fluorouracil ( 88/222 [ 40 % ] vs 65/218 [ 30 % ] ; p=0·03 ) . In multivariable analysis , fewer baseline symptoms ( odds ratio 1·32 , 95 % CI 1·14 - 1·52 ) , less widespread disease ( 1·51 , 1·05 - 2·19 ) , and use of oxaliplatin ( 0·57 , 0·39 - 0·82 ) were predictive of better OTU . INTERPRETATION FOCUS2 shows that with an appropriate design , including reduced starting doses of chemotherapy , frail and elderly patients can participate in a randomised controlled trial . On balance , a combination including oxaliplatin was preferable to single-agent fluoropyrimidines , although the primary endpoint of PFS was not met .

106,106,"Background The catalytically active 66-kDa subunit of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) reverse transcriptase ( RT ) consists of DNA polymerase , connection , and ribonuclease H ( RNase H ) domains . Almost all known RT inhibitor resistance mutations identified to date map to the polymerase domain of the enzyme . However , the connection and RNase H domains are not routinely analysed in clinical samples and none of the genotyping assays available for patient management sequence the entire RT coding region . The British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS ( the Centre ) genotypes clinical isolates up to codon 400 in RT , and our retrospective statistical analyses of the Centre ’s database have identified an N348I mutation in the RT connection domain in treatment-experienced individuals . The objective of this multidisciplinary study was to establish the in vivo relevance of this mutation and its role in drug resistance . Methods and Findings The prevalence of N348I in clinical isolates , the time taken for it to emerge under selective drug pressure , and its association with changes in viral load , specific drug treatment , and known drug resistance mutations was analysed from genotypes , viral loads , and treatment histories from the Centre ’s database . N348I increased in prevalence from below 1 % in 368 treatmentnao ¨ve individuals to 12.1 % in 1,009 treatment-experienced patients ( p ¼ 7.7 3 10 � 12 ) . N348I appeared early in therapy and was highly associated with thymidine analogue mutations ( TAMs ) M41L and T215Y/F ( p , 0.001 ) , the lamivudine resistance mutations M184V/I ( p , 0.001 ) , and non-nucleoside RTI ( NNRTI ) resistance mutations K103N and Y181C/I ( p , 0.001 ) . The association with TAMs and NNRTI resistance mutations was consistent with the selection of N348I in patients treated with regimens that included both zidovudine and nevirapine ( odds ratio 2.62 , 95 % confidence interval 1.43–4.81 ) . The appearance of N348I was associated with a significant increase in viral load ( p , 0.001 ) , which was as large as the viral load increases observed for any of the TAMs . However , this analysis did not account for the simultaneous selection of other RT or protease inhibitor resistance mutations on viral load . To delineate the role of this mutation in RT inhibitor resistance , N348I was introduced into HIV-1 molecular clones containing different genetic backbones . N348I decreased zidovudine susceptibility 2- to 4-fold in the context of wildtype HIV-1 or when combined with TAMs . N348I also decreased susceptibility to nevirapine ( 7.4fold ) and efavirenz ( 2.5-fold ) and significantly potentiated resistance to these drugs when combined with K103N . Biochemical analyses of recombinant RT containing N348I provide supporting evidence for the role of this mutation in zidovudine and NNRTI resistance and give some insight into the molecular mechanism of resistance . Conclusions  </s> N348I mutations cause resistance to zidovudine (AZT).",SUPPORTS,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]",N348I mutations cause resistance to zidovudine (AZT).,Biochemical analyses of recombinant RT containing N348I provide supporting evidence for the role of this mutation in zidovudine and NNRTI resistance and give some insight into the molecular mechanism of resistance . </s> N348I mutations cause resistance to zidovudine (AZT).,"Background The catalytically active 66-kDa subunit of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) reverse transcriptase ( RT ) consists of DNA polymerase , connection , and ribonuclease H ( RNase H ) domains .

112,112,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the cost effectiveness of standard treatment with and without the addition of ward based non-invasive ventilation in patients admitted to hospital with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . DESIGN Incremental cost effectiveness analysis of a randomised controlled trial . SETTING Medical wards in 14 hospitals in the United Kingdom . PARTICIPANTS The trial comprised 236 patients admitted to hospital with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and mild to moderate acidosis ( pH 7.25 - 7.35 ) secondary to respiratory failure . The economic analysis compared the costs of treatment that these patients received after randomisation . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Incremental cost per in-hospital death . RESULTS 24/118 died in the group receiving standard treatment and 12/118 in the group receiving non-invasive ventilation ( P=0.05 ) . Allocation to the group receiving non-invasive ventilation was associated with a reduction in costs of 49362 pounds sterling ( 78741 dollars ; 73109 euros ) , mainly through reduced use of intensive care units . The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was -645 pounds sterling per death avoided ( 95 % confidence interval -2310 pounds sterling to 386 pounds sterling ) , indicating a dominant ( more effective and less costly ) strategy . Modelling of these data indicates that a typical UK hospital providing a non-invasive ventilation service will avoid six deaths and three to nine admissions to intensive care units per year , with an associated cost reduction of 12000 - 53000 pounds sterling per year .

114,114,"An adoption study of genetic effects on obesity in adulthood was carried out in which adoptees separated from their natural parents very early in life were compared with their biological full and half siblings reared by their natural parents . The adoptees represented four groups who by sampling from a larger population were categorised as either thin , medium weight , overweight , or obese . Weight and height were obtained for 115 full siblings of 57 adoptees and for 850 half siblings of 341 adoptees . In full siblings body mass index ( kg/m2 ) significantly increased with weight of the adoptees . Body mass index of the half siblings showed a steady but weaker increase across the four weight groups of adoptees . There were no significant interactions with sex of the adoptees , sex of the siblings , or ( for the half siblings ) sex of the common parent . In contrast with the findings in half siblings and ( previously ) the natural parents there was a striking , significant increase in body mass index between full siblings of overweight and obese adoptees . The degree of fatness in adults living in the same environment appears to be influenced by genetic factors independent of sex , which may include polygenic as well as major gene effects on obesity . An analysis of the genetic factors in obesity has been carried out on a sample of nuclear families from Aosta ( N. Italy ) . The families consisted of the parents and sibs of all elementary school children considered to be obese during a preliminary screening and a similar sample of non-obese children and their nuclear families . The numbers of such families were 67 and 112 , respectively . Several tests were applied in order to examine the genetic contribution to obesity , and in particular to investigate the presence of a dominant major gene . Our conclusions are that genetic factors are certainly present . Several analyses suggest the presence of a dominant major gene with weak effect . Using the Princeton School District Family Study cohort , our specific aim was to estimate the prevalence of suspected familial ponderosity and leanness , to provide empirical risk estimates for the proportion of probands ' first-degree relatives who were similarly affected , and to estimate the contributions of diseases , drugs and caloric intake to relative obesity and leanness . We studied 379 probands , 125 whites and 52 blacks from a random recall group , 147 whites and 55 blacks from a hyperlipidemic recall group . Suspected familial obesity and leanness were arbitrarily identified in those kindreds with at least two first-degree relatives in the same Quetelet index decile as the proband , top or bottom respectively . Suspected familial obesity was observed in 2.4 percent and 6 percent respectively of random and hyperlipidemic recall group whites . Suspected familial leanness was identified in 2.4 percent and 1.4 percent of random and hyperlipidemic recall whites and in 3.8 percent of randomly recalled blacks . Approximately twice as many as expected white first-degree relatives of top Quetelet index decile probands themselves had top decile Quetelet indices ; approximately three times as many as expected first-degree relatives of bottom decile Quetelet index probands themselves had bottom decile Quetelet indices . Nineteen percent and 31 percent of top decile Quetelet index white probands from random and hyperlipidemic recall groups came from families where at least two other first-degree relatives were similarly obese ; 18 percent and 20 percent of white random and hyperlipidemic recall group probands with bottom decile Quetelet indices had suspected familial leanness . Nearly all subjects with familial obesity or leanness had no overt metabolic or pharmacological explanations for their body habitus . Within-family clustering of hypertension was common in kindreds with suspected familial obesity and was absent in kindreds with suspected familial leanness . Marked within-family clustering of both obesity and leanness is useful diagnostically ; therapeutic intervention to reduce obesity , to be most effective , should be family-wide in the many kindreds which share familial obesity . To assess the relative importance of genetic and environmental effects on the body-mass index ( weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters ) , we studied samples of identical and fraternal twins , reared apart or reared together . The samples consisted of 93 pairs of identical twins reared apart , 154 pairs of identical twins reared together , 218 pairs of fraternal twins reared apart , and 208 pairs of fraternal twins reared together . The intrapair correlation coefficients of the values for body-mass index of identical twins reared apart were 0.70 for men and 0.66 for women . These are the most direct estimates of the relative importance of genetic influences ( heritability ) on the body-mass index , and they were only slightly lower than those for twins reared together in this and earlier studies . Similar estimates were derived from maximum-likelihood model-fitting analyses--0.74 for men and 0.69 for women . Nonadditive genetic variance made a significant contribution to the estimates of heritability , particularly among men . Of the potential environmental influences , only those unique to the individual and not those shared by family members were important , contributing about 30 percent of the variance . Sharing the same childhood environment did not contribute to the similarity of the body-mass index of twins later in life . We conclude that genetic influences on body-mass index are substantial , whereas the childhood environment has little or no influence . These findings corroborate and extend the results of earlier studies of twins and adoptees . We examined the contributions of genetic factors and the family environment to human fatness in a sample of 540 adult Danish adoptees who were selected from a population of 3580 and divided into four weight classes : thin , median weight , overweight , and obese . There was a strong relation between the weight class of the adoptees and the body-mass index of their biologic parents - for the mothers , P less than 0.0001 ; for the fathers , P less than 0.02 . There was no relation between the weight class of the adoptees and the body-mass index of their adoptive parents . Cumulative distributions of the body-mass index of parents showed similar results ; there was a strong relation between the body-mass index of biologic parents and adoptee weight class and no relation between the index of adoptive parents and adoptee weight class . Furthermore , the relation between biologic parents and adoptees was not confined to the obesity weight class , but was present across the whole range of body fatness - from very thin to very fat . We conclude that genetic influences have an important role in determining human fatness in adults , whereas the family environment alone has no apparent effect .  </s> Obesity is determined solely by environmental factors.",REFUTES,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",Obesity is determined solely by environmental factors.,"sampling from a larger population were categorised as either thin , medium weight , overweight , or obese .

Several tests were applied in order to examine the genetic contribution to obesity , and in particular to investigate the presence of a dominant major gene . Our conclusions are that genetic factors are certainly present . Several analyses suggest the presence of a dominant major gene with weak effect . Using the Princeton School District Family Study cohort , our specific aim was to estimate the prevalence of suspected familial ponderosity and leanness , to provide empirical risk estimates for the proportion of probands ' first-degree relatives who were similarly affected , and to estimate the contributions of diseases , drugs and caloric intake to relative obesity and leanness . We studied 379 probands , 125 whites and 52 blacks from a random recall group , 147 whites and 55 blacks from a hyperlipidemic recall group . Suspected familial obesity and leanness were arbitrarily identified in those kindreds with at least two first-degree relatives in the same Quetelet index decile as the proband , top or bottom respectively . Suspected familial obesity was observed in 2.4 percent and 6 percent respectively of random and hyperlipidemic recall group whites . Suspected familial leanness was identified in 2.4 percent and 1.4 percent of random and hyperlipidemic recall whites and in 3.8 percent of randomly recalled blacks . Approximately twice as many as expected white first-degree relatives of top Quetelet index decile probands themselves had top decile Quetelet indices ; approximately three times as many as expected first-degree relatives of bottom decile Quetelet index probands themselves had bottom decile Quetelet indices . Nineteen percent and 31 percent of top decile Quetelet index white probands from random and hyperlipidemic recall groups came from families where at least two other first-degree relatives were similarly obese ; 18 percent and 20 percent of white random and hyperlipidemic recall group probands with bottom decile Quetelet indices had suspected familial leanness . Nearly all subjects with familial obesity or leanness had no overt metabolic or pharmacological explanations for their body habitus . Within-family clustering of hypertension was common in kindreds with suspected familial obesity and was absent in kindreds with suspected familial leanness . Marked within-family clustering of both obesity and leanness is useful diagnostically ; therapeutic intervention to reduce obesity , to be most effective , should be family-wide in the many kindreds which share familial obesity . To assess the relative importance of genetic and environmental effects on the body-mass index ( weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters ) , we studied samples of identical and fraternal twins , reared apart or reared together . The samples consisted of 93 pairs of identical twins reared apart , 154 pairs of identical twins reared together , 218 pairs of fraternal twins reared apart , and 208 pairs of fraternal twins reared together . The intrapair correlation coefficients of the values for body-mass index of identical twins reared apart were 0.70 for men and 0.66 for women . These are the most direct estimates of the relative importance of genetic influences ( heritability ) on the body-mass index , and they were only slightly lower than those for twins reared together in this and earlier studies . Similar estimates were derived from maximum-likelihood model-fitting analyses--0.74 for men and 0.69 for women . Nonadditive genetic variance made a significant contribution to the estimates of heritability , particularly among men . Of the potential environmental influences , only those unique to the individual and not those shared by family members were important , contributing about 30 percent of the variance . Sharing the same childhood environment did not contribute to the similarity of the body-mass index of twins later in life . We conclude that genetic influences on body-mass index are substantial , whereas the childhood environment has little or no influence . These findings corroborate and extend the results of earlier studies of twins and adoptees . We examined the contributions of genetic factors and the family environment to human fatness in a sample of 540 adult Danish adoptees who were selected from a population of 3580 and divided into four weight classes : thin , median weight , overweight , and obese . There was a strong relation between the weight class of the adoptees and the body-mass index of their biologic parents - for the mothers , P less than 0.0001 ; for the fathers , P less than 0.02 . There was no relation between the weight class of the adoptees and the body-mass index of their adoptive parents . Cumulative distributions of the body-mass index of parents showed similar results ; there was a strong relation between the body-mass index of biologic parents and adoptee weight class and no relation between the index of adoptive parents and adoptee weight class . Furthermore , the relation between biologic parents and adoptees was not confined to the obesity weight class , but was present across the whole range of body fatness - from very thin to very fat . We conclude that genetic influences have an important role in determining human fatness in adults , whereas the family environment alone has no apparent effect . </s> Obesity is determined solely by environmental factors.","(0, 33243, 20418, 31, 10, 2514, 1956, 58, 18072, 1720, 25, 1169, 7174, 2156, 4761, 2408, 2156, 19755, 2156, 50, 24409, 479, 17515, 8, 6958, 58, 4756, 13, 12312, 455, 10384, 9,

120,120,"Synaptic long-term potentiation ( LTP ) at spinal neurons directly communicating pain-specific inputs from the periphery to the brain has been proposed to serve as a trigger for pain hypersensitivity in pathological states . Previous studies have functionally implicated the NMDA receptor-NO pathway and the downstream second messenger , cGMP , in these processes . Because cGMP can broadly influence diverse ion-channels , kinases , and phosphodiesterases , pre- as well as post-synaptically , the precise identity of cGMP targets mediating spinal LTP , their mechanisms of action , and their locus in the spinal circuitry are still unclear . Here , we found that Protein Kinase G1 ( PKG-I ) localized presynaptically in nociceptor terminals plays an essential role in the expression of spinal LTP . Using the Cre-lox P system , we generated nociceptor-specific knockout mice lacking PKG-I specifically in presynaptic terminals of nociceptors in the spinal cord , but not in post-synaptic neurons or elsewhere ( SNS-PKG-I(-/- ) mice ) . Patch clamp recordings showed that activity-induced LTP at identified synapses between nociceptors and spinal neurons projecting to the periaqueductal grey ( PAG ) was completely abolished in SNS-PKG-I(-/- ) mice , although basal synaptic transmission was not affected . Analyses of synaptic failure rates and paired-pulse ratios indicated a role for presynaptic PKG-I in regulating the probability of neurotransmitter release . Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor 1 and myosin light chain kinase were recruited as key phosphorylation targets of presynaptic PKG-I in nociceptive neurons . Finally , behavioural analyses in vivo showed marked defects in SNS-PKG-I(-/- ) mice in several models of activity-induced nociceptive hypersensitivity , and pharmacological studies identified a clear contribution of PKG-I expressed in spinal terminals of nociceptors . Our results thus indicate that presynaptic mechanisms involving an increase in release probability from nociceptors are operational in the expression of synaptic LTP on spinal-PAG projection neurons and that PKG-I localized in presynaptic nociceptor terminals plays an essential role in this process to regulate pain sensitivity .  </s> PKG-la plays an essential role in expression of pain hypersensitivity in PGK-la knockout mice.",SUPPORTS,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]",PKG-la plays an essential role in expression of pain hypersensitivity in PGK-la knockout mice.,"Here , we found that Protein Kinase G1 ( PKG-I ) localized presynaptically in nociceptor terminals plays an essential role in the expression of spinal LTP .

127,127,"BACKGROUND Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) testing is more sensitive for the detection of high-grade cervical lesions than is cytology , but detection of HPV by DNA screening in two screening rounds 5 years apart has not been assessed . The aim of this study was to assess whether HPV DNA testing in the first screen decreases detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) grade 3 or worse , CIN grade 2 or worse , and cervical cancer in the second screening . METHODS In this randomised trial , women aged 29 - 56 years participating in the cervical screening programme in the Netherlands were randomly assigned to receive HPV DNA ( GP5+/6 + -PCR method ) and cytology co-testing or cytology testing alone , from January , 1999 , to September , 2002 . Randomisation ( in a 1:1 ratio ) was done with computer-generated random numbers after the cervical specimen had been taken . At the second screening 5 years later , HPV DNA and cytology co-testing was done in both groups ; researchers were masked to the patient 's assignment . The primary endpoint was the number of CIN grade 3 or worse detected . Analysis was done by intention to screen . The trial is now finished and is registered , number ISRCTN20781131 . FINDINGS 22,420 women were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 22 518 to the control group ; 19 999 in the intervention group and 20,106 in the control group were eligible for analysis at the first screen . At the second screen , 19 579 women in the intervention group and 19,731 in the control group were eligible , of whom 16,750 and 16,743 , respectively , attended the second screen . In the second round , CIN grade 3 or worse was less common in the intervention group than in the control group ( 88 of 19 579 in the intervention group vs 122 of 19,731 in the control group ; relative risk 0·73 , 95 % CI 0·55 - 0·96 ; p=0·023 ) . Cervical cancer was also less common in the intervention group than in the control group ( four of 19 579 in the intervention group vs 14 of 19,731 ; 0·29 , 0·10 - 0·87 ; p=0·031 ) . In the baseline round , detection of CIN grade 3 or worse did not differ significantly between groups ( 171 of 19 999 vs 150 of 20,106 ; 1·15 , 0·92 - 1·43 ; p=0·239 ) but was significantly more common in women with normal cytology ( 34 of 19,286 vs 12 of 19,373 ; 2·85 , 1·47 - 5·49 ; p=0·001 ) . Furthermore , significantly more cases of CIN grade 2 or worse were detected in the intervention group than in the control group ( 267 of 19 999 vs 215 of 20,106 ; 1·25 , 1·05 - 1·50 ; p=0·015 ) . In the second screen , fewer HPV16-positive CIN grade 3 or worse were detected in the intervention group than in the control group ( 17 of 9481 vs 35 of 9354 ; 0·48 , 0·27 - 0·85 ; p=0·012 ) ; detection of non-HPV16-positive CIN grade 3 or worse did not differ between groups ( 25 of 9481 vs 25 of 9354 ; 0·99 , 0·57 - 1·72 ; p=1·00 ) . The cumulative detection of CIN grade 3 or worse and CIN grade 2 or worse did not differ significantly between study arms , neither for the whole study group ( CIN grade 3 or worse : 259 of 19 999 vs 272 of 20,106 ; 0·96 , 0·81 - 1·14 , p=0·631 ; CIN grade 2 or worse : 427 of 19 999 vs 399 of 20,106 ; 1·08 , 0·94 - 1·24 ; p=0·292 ) , nor for subgroups of women invited for the first time ( CIN grade 3 or worse in women aged 29 - 33 years : 102 of 3139 vs 105 of 3128 ; 0·97 , 0·74 - 1·27 ; CIN grade 2 or worse in women aged 29 - 33 years : 153 of 3139 vs 151 of 3128 ; 1·01 , 0·81 - 1·26 ; CIN grade 3 or worse in women aged 34 - 56 years : 157 of 16,860 vs 167 of 16 978 ; 0·95 , 0·76 - 1·18 ; CIN grade 2 or worse in women aged 34 - 56 years : 274 of 16,860 vs 248 of 16 978 ; 1·11 , 0·94 - 1·32 ) . INTERPRETATION Implementation of HPV DNA testing in cervical screening leads to earlier detection of clinically relevant CIN grade 2 or worse , which when adequately treated , improves protection against CIN grade 3 or worse and cervical cancer . Early detection of high-grade cervical legions caused by HPV16 was a major component of this benefit . Our results lend support to the use of HPV DNA testing for all women aged 29 years and older . FUNDING Zorg Onderzoek Nederland ( Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development ) . BACKGROUND Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) testing is known to be more sensitive , but less specific than cytology for detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) . We assessed the efficacy of cervical-cancer screening policies that are based on HPV testing . METHODS Between March , 2004 , and December , 2004 , in two separate recruitment phases , women aged 25 - 60 years were randomly assigned to conventional cytology or to HPV testing in combination with liquid-based cytology ( first phase ) or alone ( second phase ) . Randomisation was done by computer in two screening centres and by sequential opening of numbered sealed envelopes in the remaining seven centres . During phase one , women who were HPV-positive and aged 35 - 60 years were referred to colposcopy , whereas women aged 25 - 34 years were referred to colposcopy only if cytology was also abnormal or HPV testing was persistently positive . During phase two , women in the HPV group were referred for colposcopy if the HPV test was positive . Two rounds of screening occurred in each phase , and all women had cytology testing only at the second round . The primary endpoint was the detection of grade 2 and 3 CIN , and of invasive cervical cancers during the first and second screening rounds . Analysis was done by intention to screen . This trial is registered , number ISRCTN81678807 . FINDINGS In total for both phases , 47,001 women were randomly assigned to the cytology group and 47,369 to HPV testing . 33,851 women from the cytology group and 32,998 from the HPV-testing group had a second round of screening . We also retrieved the histological diagnoses from screening done elsewhere . The detection of invasive cervical cancers was similar for the two groups in the first round of screening ( nine in the cytology group vs seven in the HPV group , p=0.62 ) ; no cases were detected in the HPV group during round two , compared with nine in the cytology group ( p=0.004 ) . Overall , in the two rounds of screening , 18 invasive cancers were detected in the cytology group versus seven in the HPV group ( p=0.028 ) . Among women aged 35 - 60 years , at round one the relative detection ( HPV vs cytology ) was 2.00 ( 95 % CI 1.44 - 2.77 ) for CIN2 , 2.08 ( 1.47 - 2.95 ) for CIN3 , and 2.03 ( 1.60 - 2.57 ) for CIN2 and 3 together . At round two the relative detection was 0.54 ( 0.23 - 1.28 ) for CIN2 , 0.48 ( 0.21 - 1.11 ) for CIN3 , and 0.51 ( 0.28 - 0.93 ) for CIN2 and 3 together . Among women aged 25 - 34 years , there was significant heterogeneity between phases in the relative detection of CIN3 . At round one the relative detection was 0.93 ( 0.52 - 1.64 ) in phase one and 3.91 ( 2.02 - 7.57 ) in phase two . At round two the relative detection was 1.34 ( 0.46 - 3.84 ) in phase one and 0.20 ( 0.04 - 0.93 ) in phase two . Pooling both phases , the detection ratio of CIN2 for women aged 25 - 34 years was 4.09 ( 2.24 - 7.48 ) at round one and 0.64 ( 0.23 - 1.27 ) at round two . INTERPRETATION HPV-based screening is more effective than cytology in preventing invasive cervical cancer , by detecting persistent high-grade lesions earlier and providing a longer low-risk period . However , in younger women , HPV screening leads to over-diagnosis of regressive CIN2 . FUNDING European Union , Italian Ministry of Health , Regional Health Administrations of Piemonte , Tuscany , Veneto and Emilia-Romagna , and Public Health Agency of Lazio . More than ever , clinicians need regularly updated reviews given the continuously increasing amount of new information regarding innovative cervical cancer prevention methods . A summary is given from recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews on 3 possible clinical applications of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) testing : triage of women with equivocal or low-grade cytologic abnormalities ; prediction of the therapeutic outcome after treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) lesions , and last not but not least , primary screening for cervical cancer and pre-cancer . Consistent evidence is available indicating that HPV-triage with the Hybrid Capture ( ® ) 2 assay ( Qiagen Gaithersburg , Inc. , MD , USA [ previously Digene Corp. ] ( HC2 ) is more accurate ( higher sensitivity , similar specificity ) than repeat cytology to triage women with equivocal Pap smear results . Several other tests show at least similar accuracy but mRNA testing with the APTIMA ( ® ) ( Gen-Probe Inc. , San Diego , CA , USA ) test is similarly sensitive but more specific compared to HC2 . In triage of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions ( LSIL ) , HC2 is more sensitive but its specificity is substantially lower compared to repeat cytology . The APTIMA ( ® ) test is more specific than HC2 without showing a loss in sensitivity . Identification of DNA of HPV types 16 and/or 18 , or RNA from the five most carcinogenic HPV types allow selecting women at highest risk for CIN3 + but the sensitivity and negative predictive value of these markers are lower than full-range high-risk HPV ( hrHPV ) testing . After conservative treatment of cervical pre-cancer , HPV testing picks up more quickly , with higher sensitivity and not lower specificity , residual or recurrent high-grade CIN than follow-up cytology . Primary screening for hrHPV generally detects more CIN2 , CIN3 or cancer compared to cytology at cut-off atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance ( ASC-US ) or LSIL , but is less specific . Combined HPV and cytology screening provides a further small gain in sensitivity at the expense of a considerable loss in specificity if positive by either test is referred to colposcopy , in comparison with HPV testing only . Randomised trials and follow-up of cohort studies consistently demonstrate a significantly lower cumulative incidence of CIN3 + and even of cancer , in women aged 30 years or older , who were at enrollment hrHPV DNA negative compared to those who were cytologically negative . The difference in cumulative risk of CIN3 + or cancer for double negative ( cytology & HPV ) versus only HPV-negative women is small . HC2 , GP5+/6 + PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ) , cobas ( ® ) 4800 PCR ( Roche Molecular Systems Inc. , Alameda , CA , USA ) and Real Time PCR ( Abbott Molecular , Des Plaines , IL , USA ) can be considered as clinically validated for use in primary screening . The loss in specificity associated with primary HPV-based screening can be compensated by appropriate algorithms involving reflex cytology and/or HPV genotyping for HPV16 or 18 . There exists a substantial evidence base to support that HPV testing is advantageous both in triage of women with equivocal abnormal cytology , in surveillance after treatment of CIN lesions and in primary screening of women aged 30 years or older . However , the possible advantages offered by HPV-based screening require a well organised program with good compliance with screening and triage policies . This article forms part of a special supplement entitled "" Comprehensive Control of HPV Infections and Related Diseases "" Vaccine Volume 30 , Supplement 5 , 2012 . BACKGROUND Screening for cervical cancer based on testing for human papillomavirus ( HPV ) increases the sensitivity of detection of high-grade ( grade 2 or 3 ) cervical intraepithelial neoplasia , but whether this gain represents overdiagnosis or protection against future high-grade cervical epithelial neoplasia or cervical cancer is unknown . METHODS In a population-based screening program in Sweden , 12,527 women 32 to 38 years of age were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to have an HPV test plus a Papanicolaou ( Pap ) test ( intervention group ) or a Pap test alone ( control group ) . Women with a positive HPV test and a normal Pap test result were offered a second HPV test at least 1 year later , and those who were found to be persistently infected with the same high-risk type of HPV were then offered colposcopy with cervical biopsy . A similar number of double-blinded Pap smears and colposcopies with biopsy were performed in randomly selected women in the control group . Comprehensive registry data were used to follow the women for a mean of 4.1 years . The relative rates of grade 2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer detected at enrollment and at subsequent screening examinations were calculated . RESULTS At enrollment , the proportion of women in the intervention group who were found to have lesions of grade 2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer was 51 % greater ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 13 to 102 ) than the proportion of women in the control group who were found to have such lesions . At subsequent screening examinations , the proportion of women in the intervention group who were found to have grade 2 or 3 lesions or cancer was 42 % less ( 95 % CI , 4 to 64 ) and the proportion with grade 3 lesions or cancer was 47 % less ( 95 % CI , 2 to 71 ) than the proportions of control women who were found to have such lesions . Women with persistent HPV infection remained at high risk for grade 2 or 3 lesions or cancer after referral for colposcopy . CONCLUSIONS The addition of an HPV test to the Pap test to screen women in their mid-30s for cervical cancer reduces the incidence of grade 2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer detected by subsequent screening examinations .

The aim of this study was to assess whether HPV DNA the intervention group than in the control group ( 88 of 19 579 in the intervention group vs 122 of 19,731 in the control group ; relative risk 0·73 , 95 % CI 0·55 group vs 14 of 19,731 ; 0·29 , 0·10 - 0·87 ; p=0·031 ) . In the baseline round , detection of CIN grade 3 or worse did not differ significantly between groups ( 171 of 19 999 vs 150 of 20,106 ; 1·15 , 0·92 - 1·43 ; p=0·239 ) but was significantly more common in women with normal cytology ( 34 Furthermore , significantly more cases of CIN grade 2 or worse were detected in the intervention group than in the control group ( 267 of 19 999 vs 215 of 20,106 ; 1·25 , 1·05 - 1·50 ; p=0·015 ) . arms , neither for the whole study group ( CIN grade 3 or worse : 259 of 19 999 vs 272 of 20,106 ; 0·96 , 0·81 </s> Primary cervical cancer screening with HPV detection has higher longitudinal sensitivity than conventional cytology to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2.","testing in the first screen decreases detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) grade 3 or worse , CIN grade 2 or worse , and cervical cancer in the second screening . METHODS In this randomised trial , women aged 29 - 56 years participating in the cervical screening programme in the Netherlands were randomly assigned to receive HPV DNA ( GP5+/6 + -PCR method ) and cytology co-testing or cytology testing alone , from January , 1999 , to September , 2002 . Randomisation ( in a 1:1 ratio ) was done with computer-generated random numbers after the cervical specimen had been taken . At the second screening 5 years later , HPV DNA and cytology co-testing was done in both groups ; researchers were masked to the patient 's assignment . The primary endpoint was the number of CIN grade 3 or worse detected . Analysis was done by intention to screen . The trial is now finished and is registered , number ISRCTN20781131 . FINDINGS 22,420 women were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 22 518 to the control group ; 19 999 in the intervention group and 20,106 in the control group were eligible for analysis at the first screen . At the second screen , 19 579 women in the intervention group and 19,731 in the control group were eligible , of whom 16,750 and 16,743 , respectively , attended the second screen . In the second round , CIN grade 3 or worse was less common in - 0·96 ; p=0·023 ) . Cervical cancer was also less common in the intervention group than in the control group ( four of 19 579 in the intervention of 19,286 vs 12 of 19,373 ; 2·85 , 1·47 - 5·49 ; p=0·001 ) . In the second screen , fewer HPV16-positive CIN grade 3 or worse were detected in the intervention group than in the control group ( 17 of 9481 vs 35 of 9354 ; 0·48 , 0·27 - 0·85 ; p=0·012 ) ; detection of non-HPV16-positive CIN grade 3 or worse did not differ between groups ( 25 of 9481 vs 25 of 9354 ; 0·99 , 0·57 - 1·72 ; p=1·00 ) .

INTERPRETATION Implementation of HPV DNA testing in cervical screening leads to earlier detection of clinically relevant CIN grade 2 or worse , which when adequately treated , improves protection against CIN grade 3 or worse and cervical cancer . Early detection of high-grade cervical legions caused by HPV16 was a major component of this benefit . Our results lend support to the use of HPV DNA testing for all women aged 29 years and older . FUNDING Zorg Onderzoek Nederland ( Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development ) . BACKGROUND Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) testing is known to be more sensitive , but less specific than cytology for detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) . We assessed the efficacy of cervical-cancer screening policies that are based on HPV testing . METHODS Between March , 2004 , and December , 2004 , in two separate recruitment phases , women aged 25 - 60 years were randomly assigned to conventional cytology or to HPV testing in combination with liquid-based cytology ( first phase ) or alone ( second phase ) . Randomisation was done by computer in two screening centres and by sequential opening of numbered sealed envelopes in the remaining seven centres . During phase one , women who were HPV-positive and aged 35 - 60 years were referred to colposcopy , whereas women aged 25 - 34 years were referred to colposcopy only if cytology was also abnormal or HPV testing was persistently positive . During phase two , women in the HPV group were referred for colposcopy if the HPV test was positive . Two rounds of screening occurred in each phase , and all women had cytology testing only at the second round . The primary endpoint was the detection of grade 2 and 3 CIN , and of invasive cervical cancers during the first and second screening rounds . Analysis was done by intention to screen . This trial is registered , number ISRCTN81678807 . FINDINGS In total for both phases , 47,001 women were randomly assigned to the cytology group and 47,369 to HPV testing . 33,851 women from the cytology group and 32,998 from the HPV-testing group had a second round of screening . We also retrieved the histological diagnoses from screening done elsewhere . The detection of invasive cervical cancers was similar for the two groups in the first round of screening ( nine in the cytology group vs seven in the HPV group , p=0.62 ) ; no cases were detected in the HPV group during round two , compared with nine in the cytology group ( p=0.004 ) . Overall , in the two rounds of screening , 18 invasive cancers were detected in the cytology group versus seven in the HPV group ( p=0.028 ) . Among women aged 35 - 60 years , at round one the relative detection ( HPV vs cytology ) was 2.00 ( 95 % CI 1.44 - 2.77 ) for CIN2 , 2.08 ( 1.47 - 2.95 ) for CIN3 , and 2.03 ( 1.60 - 2.57 ) for CIN2 and 3 together . At round two the relative detection was 0.54 ( 0.23 - 1.28 ) for CIN2 , 0.48 ( 0.21 - 1.11 ) for CIN3 , and 0.51 ( 0.28 - 0.93 ) for CIN2 and 3 together . Among women aged 25 - 34 years , there was significant heterogeneity between phases in the relative detection of CIN3 . At round one the relative detection was 0.93 ( 0.52 - 1.64 ) in phase one and 3.91 ( 2.02 - 7.57 ) in phase two . At round two the relative detection was 1.34 ( 0.46 - 3.84 ) in phase one and 0.20 ( 0.04 - 0.93 ) in phase two . Pooling both phases , the detection ratio of CIN2 for women aged 25 - 34 years was 4.09 ( 2.24 - 7.48 ) at round one and 0.64 ( 0.23 - 1.27 ) at round two . INTERPRETATION HPV-based screening is more effective than cytology in preventing invasive cervical cancer , by detecting persistent high-grade lesions earlier and providing a longer low-risk period . However , in younger women , HPV screening leads to over-diagnosis of regressive CIN2 . FUNDING European Union , Italian Ministry of Health , Regional Health Administrations of Piemonte , Tuscany , Veneto and Emilia-Romagna , and Public Health Agency of Lazio . More than ever , clinicians need regularly updated reviews given the continuously increasing amount of new information regarding innovative cervical cancer prevention methods . A summary is given from recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews on 3 possible clinical applications of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) testing : triage of women with equivocal or low-grade cytologic abnormalities ; prediction of the therapeutic outcome after treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) lesions , and last not but not least , primary screening for cervical cancer and pre-cancer . Consistent evidence is available indicating that HPV-triage with the Hybrid Capture ( ® ) 2 assay ( Qiagen Gaithersburg , Inc. , MD , USA [ previously Digene Corp. ] ( HC2 ) is more accurate ( higher sensitivity , similar specificity ) than repeat cytology to triage women with equivocal Pap smear results . Several other tests show at least similar accuracy but mRNA testing with the APTIMA ( ® ) ( Gen-Probe Inc. , San Diego , CA , USA ) test is similarly sensitive but more specific compared to HC2 . In triage of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions ( LSIL ) , HC2 is more sensitive but its specificity is substantially lower compared to repeat cytology . The APTIMA ( ® ) test is more specific than HC2 without showing a loss in sensitivity . Identification of DNA of HPV types 16 and/or 18 , or RNA from the five most carcinogenic HPV types allow selecting women at highest risk for CIN3 + but the sensitivity and negative predictive value of these markers are lower than full-range high-risk HPV ( hrHPV ) testing . After conservative treatment of cervical pre-cancer , HPV testing picks up more quickly , with higher sensitivity and not lower specificity , residual or recurrent high-grade CIN than follow-up cytology . Primary screening for hrHPV generally detects more CIN2 , CIN3 or cancer compared to cytology at cut-off atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance ( ASC-US ) or LSIL , but is less specific . Combined HPV and cytology screening provides a further small gain in sensitivity at the expense of a considerable loss in specificity if positive by either test is referred to colposcopy , in comparison with HPV testing only . Randomised trials and follow-up of cohort studies consistently demonstrate a significantly lower cumulative incidence of CIN3 + and even of cancer , in women aged 30 years or older , who were at enrollment hrHPV DNA negative compared to those who were cytologically negative . The difference in cumulative risk of CIN3 + or cancer for double negative ( cytology & HPV ) versus only HPV-negative women is small . HC2 , GP5+/6 + PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ) , cobas ( ® ) 4800 PCR ( Roche Molecular Systems Inc. , Alameda , CA , USA ) and Real Time PCR ( Abbott Molecular , Des Plaines , IL , USA ) can be considered as clinically validated for use in primary screening . The loss in specificity associated with primary HPV-based screening can be compensated by appropriate algorithms involving reflex cytology and/or HPV genotyping for HPV16 or 18 . There exists a substantial evidence base to support that HPV testing is advantageous both in triage of women with equivocal abnormal cytology , in surveillance after treatment of CIN lesions and in primary screening of women aged 30 years or older . However , the possible advantages offered by HPV-based screening require a well organised program with good compliance with screening and triage policies . This article forms part of a special supplement entitled "" Comprehensive Control of HPV Infections and Related Diseases "" Vaccine Volume 30 , Supplement 5 , 2012 . BACKGROUND Screening for cervical cancer based on testing for human papillomavirus ( HPV ) increases the sensitivity of detection of high-grade ( grade 2 or 3 ) cervical intraepithelial neoplasia , but whether this gain represents overdiagnosis or protection against future high-grade cervical epithelial neoplasia or cervical cancer is unknown . METHODS In a population-based screening program in Sweden , 12,527 women 32 to 38 years of age were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to have an HPV test plus a Papanicolaou ( Pap ) test ( intervention group ) or a Pap test alone ( control group ) . Women with a positive HPV test and a normal Pap test result were offered a second HPV test at least 1 year later , and those who were found to be persistently infected with the same high-risk type of HPV were then offered colposcopy with cervical biopsy . A similar number of double-blinded Pap smears and colposcopies with biopsy were performed in randomly selected women in the control group . Comprehensive registry data were used to follow the women for a mean of 4.1 years . The relative rates of grade 2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer detected at enrollment and at subsequent screening examinations were calculated . RESULTS At enrollment , the proportion of women in the intervention group who were found to have lesions of grade 2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer was 51 % greater ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 13 to 102 ) than the proportion of women in the control group who were found to have such lesions . At subsequent screening examinations , the proportion of women in the intervention group who were found to have grade 2 or 3 lesions or cancer was 42 % less ( 95 % CI , 4 to 64 ) and the proportion with grade 3 lesions or cancer was 47 % less ( 95 % CI , 2 to 71 ) than the proportions of control women who were found to have such lesions . Women with persistent HPV infection remained at high risk for grade 2 or 3 lesions or cancer after referral for colposcopy . CONCLUSIONS The addition of an HPV test to the Pap test to screen women in their mid-30s for cervical cancer reduces the incidence of grade 2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer detected by subsequent screening examinations .

129,129,"The canonical role of messenger RNA ( mRNA ) is to deliver protein-coding information to sites of protein synthesis . However , given that microRNAs bind to RNAs , we hypothesized that RNAs could possess a regulatory role that relies on their ability to compete for microRNA binding , independently of their protein-coding function . As a model for the protein-coding-independent role of RNAs , we describe the functional relationship between the mRNAs produced by the PTEN tumour suppressor gene and its pseudogene PTENP1 and the critical consequences of this interaction . We find that PTENP1 is biologically active as it can regulate cellular levels of PTEN and exert a growth-suppressive role . We also show that the PTENP1 locus is selectively lost in human cancer .

However , given that microRNAs bind to RNAs , we hypothesized that RNAs could possess a regulatory role that relies on their ability to compete for microRNA binding , independently of their protein-coding function . As a model for the protein-coding-independent role of RNAs , we describe the functional relationship between the mRNAs produced by the PTEN tumour suppressor gene and its pseudogene PTENP1 and the critical consequences of this interaction .

131,131,"OBJECTIVE To investigate the long term effect of radioactive iodine on thyroid function and size in patients with non-toxic multinodular goitre . DESIGN Consecutive patients with multinodular non-toxic goitre selected for radioactive iodine treatment and followed for a minimum of 12 months ( median 48 months ) after an intended dose of 3.7 MBq/g thyroid tissue corrected to a 100 % uptake of iodine-131 in 24 hours . PATIENTS 69 patients with a growing multinodular non-toxic goitre causing local compression symptoms or cosmetic inconveniences . The treatment was chosen because of a high operative risk , previous thyroidectomy , or refusal to be operated on . MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Standard thyroid function variables and ultrasonically determined thyroid volume before treatment as well as 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , and 12 months after treatment and then once a year . RESULTS 56 patients were treated with a single dose of 131I , 12 with two doses , and one with four doses . In 45 patients treated with one dose and remaining euthyroid the median thyroid volume was reduced from 73 ( interquartile range 50 - 106 ) ml to 29 ( 23 - 48 ) ml at 24 months in the 39 patients in whom this was measured during follow up . The median reduction was 40 ( 22 - 48 ) ml ( 60 % reduction , p < 0.0001 ) , half of which occurred within three months . Patients treated with two doses as well as those developing hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism had a significant reduction in thyroid volume . Eleven patients developed hypothyroidism ( cumulative five year risk 22 % , 95 % confidence interval 4.8 % to 38.4 % ) . Side effects were few : three cases of hyperthyroidism and two cases of radiation thyroiditis . Only one patient was dissatisfied with the result ; she was referred for operation six months after treatment . CONCLUSIONS A substantial reduction in thyroid volume accompanied by a low incidence of hypothyroidism and few side effects makes the use of radioactive iodine an attractive alternative to surgery in selected cases of non-toxic multinodular goitre .  </s> Radioiodine treatment of non-toxic multinodular goitre reduces thyroid volume.",SUPPORTS,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]",Radioiodine treatment of non-toxic multinodular goitre reduces thyroid volume.,In 45 patients treated with one dose and remaining euthyroid the median thyroid volume was reduced from 73 ( interquartile range 50 - 106 ) ml to 29 ( 23 - 48 ) ml at 24 months in the 39 patients in whom this was measured during follow up .

134,134,"Although susceptibility of neurons in the brain to microbial infection is a major determinant of clinical outcome , little is known about the molecular factors governing this vulnerability . Here we show that two types of neurons from distinct brain regions showed differential permissivity to replication of several positive-stranded RNA viruses . Granule cell neurons of the cerebellum and cortical neurons from the cerebral cortex have unique innate immune programs that confer differential susceptibility to viral infection ex vivo and in vivo .

Here we show that two types of neurons from distinct brain regions showed differential permissivity to replication of several positive-stranded RNA viruses . Granule cell neurons of the cerebellum and cortical neurons from the cerebral cortex have unique innate immune programs that confer differential susceptibility to viral infection ex vivo and in vivo .

136,136,"Numerous reports have demonstrated that CD4(+)CD25(+ ) regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) from individuals with a range of human autoimmune diseases , including type 1 diabetes , are deficient in their ability to control autologous proinflammatory responses when compared with nondiseased , control individuals . Treg dysfunction could be a primary , causal event or may result from perturbations in the immune system during disease development . Polymorphisms in genes associated with Treg function , such as IL2RA , confer a higher risk of autoimmune disease . Although this suggests a primary role for defective Tregs in autoimmunity , a link between IL2RA gene polymorphisms and Treg function has not been examined . We addressed this by examining the impact of an IL2RA haplotype associated with type 1 diabetes on Treg fitness and suppressive function . Studies were conducted using healthy human subjects to avoid any confounding effects of disease . We demonstrated that the presence of an autoimmune disease-associated IL2RA haplotype correlates with diminished IL-2 responsiveness in Ag-experienced CD4(+ ) T cells , as measured by phosphorylation of STAT5a , and is associated with lower levels of FOXP3 expression by Tregs and a reduction in their ability to suppress proliferation of autologous effector T cells . These data offer a rationale that contributes to the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which polymorphisms in the IL-2RA gene affect immune regulation , and consequently upon susceptibility to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases . Autoimmune diseases are thought to result from imbalances in normal immune physiology and regulation . Here , we show that autoimmune disease susceptibility and resistance alleles on mouse chromosome 3 ( Idd3 ) correlate with differential expression of the key immunoregulatory cytokine interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) . In order to test directly that an approximately twofold reduction in IL-2 underpins the Idd3-linked destabilization of immune homeostasis , we show that engineered haplodeficiency of Il2 gene expression not only reduces T cell IL-2 production by twofold but also mimics the autoimmune dysregulatory effects of the naturally occurring susceptibility alleles of Il2 . Reduced IL-2 production achieved by either genetic mechanism correlates with reduced function of CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells , which are critical for maintaining immune homeostasis .

Polymorphisms in genes associated with Treg function , such as IL2RA , confer a higher risk of autoimmune disease . Although this suggests a primary role for defective Tregs in autoimmunity , a link between IL2RA gene polymorphisms and Treg function has not been examined . We addressed this by examining the impact of an IL2RA haplotype associated with type 1 diabetes on Treg fitness and suppressive function . Studies were conducted using healthy human subjects to avoid any confounding effects of disease . We demonstrated that the presence of an autoimmune disease-associated IL2RA haplotype correlates with diminished IL-2 responsiveness in Ag-experienced CD4(+ ) T cells , as measured by phosphorylation of STAT5a , and is associated with lower levels of FOXP3 expression by Tregs and a reduction in their ability to suppress proliferation of autologous effector T cells . </s> Reduced responsiveness to interleukin-2 in regulatory T cells is associated with greater resistance to autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 Diabetes.","Numerous reports have demonstrated that CD4(+)CD25(+ ) regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) from individuals with a range of human autoimmune diseases , including type 1 diabetes , are deficient in their ability to control autologous proinflammatory responses when compared with nondiseased , control individuals .

137,137,"Nucleosomes containing the histone variant H3.3 tend to be clustered in vivo in the neighborhood of transcriptionally active genes and over regulatory elements . It has not been clear , however , whether H3.3-containing nucleosomes possess unique properties that would affect transcription . We report here that H3.3 nucleosomes isolated from vertebrates , regardless of whether they are partnered with H2A or H2A.Z , are unusually sensitive to salt-dependent disruption , losing H2A/H2B or H2A.Z/H2B dimers . Immunoprecipitation studies of nucleosome core particles ( NCPs ) show that NCPs that contain both H3.3 and H2A.Z are even less stable than NCPs containing H3.3 and H2A . Intriguingly , NCPs containing H3 and H2A.Z are at least as stable as H3/H2A NCPs .

It has not been clear , however , whether H3.3-containing nucleosomes possess unique properties that would affect transcription . We report here that H3.3 nucleosomes isolated from vertebrates , regardless of whether they are partnered with H2A or H2A.Z , are unusually sensitive to salt-dependent disruption , losing H2A/H2B or H2A.Z/H2B dimers . Intriguingly , NCPs containing H3 and H2A.Z are at least as stable as H3/H2A NCPs . These results establish an hierarchy of stabilities for native nucleosomes carrying different complements of variants , and suggest how H2A.Z could play different roles depending on its partners within the NCP . They also are consistent with the idea that H3.3 plays an active role in maintaining accessible chromatin structures in enhancer regions and transcribed regions .

OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy of sildenafil citrate in men with sexual dysfunction associated with the use of selective and nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SRI ) antidepressants . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PATIENTS Prospective , parallel-group , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted between November 1 , 2000 , and January 1 , 2001 , at 3 US university medical centers among 90 male outpatients ( mean [ SD ] age , 45 [ 8 ] years ) with major depression in remission and sexual dysfunction associated with SRI antidepressant treatment . INTERVENTION Patients were randomly assigned to take sildenafil ( n = 45 ) or placebo ( n = 45 ) at a flexible dose starting at 50 mg and adjustable to 100 mg before sexual activity for 6 weeks . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measure was score on the Clinical Global Impression-Sexual Function ( CGI-SF ) ; secondary measures were scores on the International Index of Erectile Function , Arizona Sexual Experience Scale , Massachusetts General Hospital-Sexual Functioning Questionnaire , and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ( HAM-D ) . RESULTS Among the 90 randomized patients , 93 % ( 83/89 ) of patients treated per protocol took at least 1 dose of study drug and 85 % ( 76/89 ) completed week 6 end-point assessments with last observation carried forward analyses . At a CGI-SF score of 2 or lower , 54.5 % ( 24/44 ) of sildenafil compared with 4.4 % ( 2/45 ) of placebo patients were much or very much improved ( P<.001 ) . Erectile function , arousal , ejaculation , orgasm , and overall satisfaction domain measures improved significantly in sildenafil compared with placebo patients . Mean depression scores remained consistent with remission ( HAM-D score < or = 10 ) in both groups for the study duration .

142,142,"Modification of proteins by SUMO is essential for the maintenance of genome integrity . During DNA replication , the Mms21-branch of the SUMO pathway counteracts recombination intermediates at damaged replication forks , thus facilitating sister chromatid disjunction . The Mms21 SUMO ligase docks to the arm region of the Smc5 protein in the Smc5/6 complex ; together , they cooperate during recombinational DNA repair . Yet how the activity of the SUMO ligase is controlled remains unknown . Here we show that the SUMO ligase and the chromosome disjunction functions of Mms21 depend on its docking to an intact and active Smc5/6 complex , indicating that the Smc5/6-Mms21 complex operates as a large SUMO ligase in vivo . In spite of the physical distance separating the E3 and the nucleotide-binding domains in Smc5/6 , Mms21-dependent sumoylation requires binding of ATP to Smc5 , a step that is part of the ligase mechanism that assists Ubc9 function .

During DNA replication , the Mms21-branch of the SUMO pathway counteracts recombination intermediates at damaged replication forks , thus facilitating sister chromatid disjunction . The Mms21 SUMO ligase docks to the arm region of the Smc5 protein in the Smc5/6 complex ; together , they cooperate during recombinational DNA repair . Yet how the activity of the SUMO ligase is controlled remains unknown . Here we show that the SUMO ligase and the chromosome disjunction functions of Mms21 depend on its docking to an intact and active Smc5/6 complex , indicating that the Smc5/6-Mms21 complex operates as a large SUMO ligase in vivo . In spite of the physical distance separating the E3 and the nucleotide-binding domains in Smc5/6 , Mms21-dependent sumoylation requires binding of ATP to Smc5 , a step that is part of the ligase mechanism that assists Ubc9 function . The communication is enabled by the presence of a conserved disruption in the coiled coil domain of Smc5 , pointing to potential conformational changes for SUMO ligase activation . Our results demonstrate that the ATP-binding activity of the Smc5/6 complex is coordinated with its SUMO ligase , through the coiled coil domain of Smc5 and the physical remodeling of the molecule ,

143,143,"Importance Although non – vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants ( NOACs ) are increasingly used to prevent thromboembolic disease , there are limited data on NOAC-related intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) . Objective To assess the association between preceding oral anticoagulant use ( warfarin , NOACs , and no oral anticoagulants [ OACs ] ) and in-hospital mortality among patients with ICH . Design , Setting , and Participants Retrospective cohort study of 141 311 patients with ICH admitted from October 2013 to December 2016 to 1662 Get With The Guidelines – Stroke hospitals . Exposures Anticoagulation therapy before ICH , defined as any use of OACs within 7 days prior to hospital arrival . Main Outcomes and Measures In-hospital mortality . Results Among 141 311 patients with ICH ( mean [ SD ] age , 68.3 [ 15.3 ] years ; 48.1 % women ) , 15 036 ( 10.6 % ) were taking warfarin and 4918 ( 3.5 % ) were taking NOACs preceding ICH , and 39 585 ( 28.0 % ) and 5783 ( 4.1 % ) were taking concomitant single and dual antiplatelet agents , respectively . Patients with prior use of warfarin or NOACs were older and had higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation and prior stroke . Acute ICH stroke severity ( measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ) was not significantly different across the 3 groups ( median , 9 [ interquartile range , 2 - 21 ] for warfarin , 8 [ 2 - 20 ] for NOACs , and 8 [ 2 - 19 ] for no OACs ) . The unadjusted in-hospital mortality rates were 32.6 % for warfarin , 26.5 % for NOACs , and 22.5 % for no OACs . Compared with patients without prior use of OACs , the risk of in-hospital mortality was higher among patients with prior use of warfarin ( adjusted risk difference [ ARD ] , 9.0 % [ 97.5 % CI , 7.9 % to 10.1 % ] ; adjusted odds ratio [ AOR ] , 1.62 [ 97.5 % CI , 1.53 to 1.71 ] ) and higher among patients with prior use of NOACs ( ARD , 3.3 % [ 97.5 % CI , 1.7 % to 4.8 % ] ; AOR , 1.21 [ 97.5 % CI , 1.11 - 1.32 ] ) . Compared with patients with prior use of warfarin , patients with prior use of NOACs had a lower risk of in-hospital mortality ( ARD , −5.7 % [ 97.5 % CI , −7.3 % to −4.2 % ] ; AOR , 0.75 [ 97.5 % CI , 0.69 to 0.81 ] ) . The difference in mortality between NOAC-treated patients and warfarin-treated patients was numerically greater among patients with prior use of dual antiplatelet agents ( 32.7 % vs 47.1 % ; ARD , −15.0 % [ 95.5 % CI , −26.3 % to −3.8 % ] ; AOR , 0.50 [ 97.5 % CI , 0.29 to 0.86 ] ) than among those taking these agents without prior antiplatelet therapy ( 26.4 % vs 31.7 % ; ARD , −5.0 % [ 97.5 % CI , −6.8 % to −3.2 % ] ; AOR , 0.77 [ 97.5 % CI , 0.70 to 0.85 ] ) , although the interaction P value ( .07 ) was not statistically significant . Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with ICH , prior use of NOACs or warfarin was associated with higher in-hospital mortality compared with no OACs . Prior use of NOACs , compared with prior use of warfarin , was associated with lower risk of in-hospital mortality .  </s> Stroke patients with prior use of direct oral anticoagulants have a lower risk of in-hospital mortality than stroke patients with prior use of warfarin.",SUPPORTS,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]",Stroke patients with prior use of direct oral anticoagulants have a lower risk of in-hospital mortality than stroke patients with prior use of warfarin.,"The unadjusted in-hospital mortality rates were 32.6 % for warfarin , 26.5 % for NOACs , and 22.5 % for no OACs .

Prior use of NOACs , compared with prior use of warfarin , was associated with lower risk of in-hospital mortality . </s> Stroke patients with prior use of direct oral anticoagulants have a lower risk of in-hospital mortality than stroke patients with prior use of warfarin.","Importance Although non – vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants ( NOACs ) are increasingly used to prevent thromboembolic disease , there are limited data on NOAC-related intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) . Objective To assess the association between preceding oral anticoagulant use ( warfarin , NOACs , and no oral anticoagulants [ OACs ] ) and in-hospital mortality among patients with ICH . Design , Setting , and Participants Retrospective cohort study of 141 311 patients with ICH admitted from October 2013 to December 2016 to 1662 Get With The Guidelines – Stroke hospitals . Exposures Anticoagulation therapy before ICH , defined as any use of OACs within 7 days prior to hospital arrival . Main Outcomes and Measures In-hospital mortality . Results Among 141 311 patients with ICH ( mean [ SD ] age , 68.3 [ 15.3 ] years ; 48.1 % women ) , 15 036 ( 10.6 % ) were taking warfarin and 4918 ( 3.5 % ) were taking NOACs preceding ICH , and 39 585 ( 28.0 % ) and 5783 ( 4.1 % ) were taking concomitant single and dual antiplatelet agents , respectively . Patients with prior use of warfarin or NOACs were older and had higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation and prior stroke . Acute ICH stroke severity ( measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ) was not significantly different across the 3 groups ( median , 9 [ interquartile range , 2 - 21 ] for warfarin , 8 [ 2 - 20 ] for NOACs , and 8 [ 2 - 19 ] for no OACs ) . The difference in mortality between NOAC-treated patients and warfarin-treated patients was numerically greater among patients with prior use of dual antiplatelet agents ( 32.7 % vs 47.1 % ; ARD , −15.0 % [ 95.5 % CI , −26.3 % to −3.8 % ] ; AOR , 0.50 [ 97.5 % CI , 0.29 to 0.86 ] ) than among those taking these agents without prior antiplatelet therapy ( 26.4 % vs 31.7 % ; ARD , −5.0 % [ 97.5 % CI , −6.8 % to −3.2 % ] ; AOR , 0.77 [ 97.5 % CI , 0.70 to 0.85 ] ) , although the interaction P value ( .07 ) was not statistically significant . Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with ICH , prior use of NOACs or warfarin was associated with higher in-hospital mortality compared with no OACs . </s> Stroke patients with prior use of direct oral anticoagulants have a lower risk of in-hospital mortality than stroke patients with prior use of warfarin.","(0, 133, 542, 25350, 11, 12, 40179, 15812, 1162, 58, 2107, 4, 401, 7606, 13,

145,145,"BACKGROUND The Global Burden of Diseases , Injuries , and Risk Factors Study 2015 provides an up-to-date synthesis of the evidence for risk factor exposure and the attributable burden of disease . By providing national and subnational assessments spanning the past 25 years , this study can inform debates on the importance of addressing risks in context . METHODS We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for previous iterations of the Global Burden of Disease Study to estimate attributable deaths , disability-adjusted life-years ( DALYs ) , and trends in exposure by age group , sex , year , and geography for 79 behavioural , environmental and occupational , and metabolic risks or clusters of risks from 1990 to 2015 . This study included 388 risk-outcome pairs that met World Cancer Research Fund-defined criteria for convincing or probable evidence . We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from randomised controlled trials , cohorts , pooled cohorts , household surveys , census data , satellite data , and other sources . We used statistical models to pool data , adjust for bias , and incorporate covariates . We developed a metric that allows comparisons of exposure across risk factors-the summary exposure value . Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk level , we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk . We decomposed trends in attributable burden into contributions from population growth , population age structure , risk exposure , and risk-deleted cause-specific DALY rates . We characterised risk exposure in relation to a Socio-demographic Index ( SDI ) . FINDINGS Between 1990 and 2015 , global exposure to unsafe sanitation , household air pollution , childhood underweight , childhood stunting , and smoking each decreased by more than 25 % . Global exposure for several occupational risks , high body-mass index ( BMI ) , and drug use increased by more than 25 % over the same period . All risks jointly evaluated in 2015 accounted for 57·8 % ( 95 % CI 56·6 - 58·8 ) of global deaths and 41·2 % ( 39·8 - 42·8 ) of DALYs . In 2015 , the ten largest contributors to global DALYs among Level 3 risks were high systolic blood pressure ( 211·8 million [ 192·7 million to 231·1 million ] global DALYs ) , smoking ( 148·6 million [ 134·2 million to 163·1 million ] ) , high fasting plasma glucose ( 143·1 million [ 125·1 million to 163·5 million ] ) , high BMI ( 120·1 million [ 83·8 million to 158·4 million ] ) , childhood undernutrition ( 113·3 million [ 103·9 million to 123·4 million ] ) , ambient particulate matter ( 103·1 million [ 90·8 million to 115·1 million ] ) , high total cholesterol ( 88·7 million [ 74·6 million to 105·7 million ] ) , household air pollution ( 85·6 million [ 66·7 million to 106·1 million ] ) , alcohol use ( 85·0 million [ 77·2 million to 93·0 million ] ) , and diets high in sodium ( 83·0 million [ 49·3 million to 127·5 million ] ) . From 1990 to 2015 , attributable DALYs declined for micronutrient deficiencies , childhood undernutrition , unsafe sanitation and water , and household air pollution ; reductions in risk-deleted DALY rates rather than reductions in exposure drove these declines . Rising exposure contributed to notable increases in attributable DALYs from high BMI , high fasting plasma glucose , occupational carcinogens , and drug use . Environmental risks and childhood undernutrition declined steadily with SDI ; low physical activity , high BMI , and high fasting plasma glucose increased with SDI . In 119 countries , metabolic risks , such as high BMI and fasting plasma glucose , contributed the most attributable DALYs in 2015 . Regionally , smoking still ranked among the leading five risk factors for attributable DALYs in 109 countries ; childhood underweight and unsafe sex remained primary drivers of early death and disability in much of sub-Saharan Africa . INTERPRETATION Declines in some key environmental risks have contributed to declines in critical infectious diseases . Some risks appear to be invariant to SDI . Increasing risks , including high BMI , high fasting plasma glucose , drug use , and some occupational exposures , contribute to rising burden from some conditions , but also provide opportunities for intervention . Some highly preventable risks , such as smoking , remain major causes of attributable DALYs , even as exposure is declining . Public policy makers need to pay attention to the risks that are increasingly major contributors to global burden .

GSCs are regulated by molecular pathways distinct from the bulk tumor that may be useful therapeutic targets . We determined that A20 ( TNFAIP3 ) , a regulator of cell survival and the NF-kappaB pathway , is overexpressed in GSCs relative to non-stem glioblastoma cells at both the mRNA and protein levels . To determine the functional significance of A20 in GSCs , we targeted A20 expression with lentiviral-mediated delivery of short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) . Inhibiting A20 expression decreased GSC growth and survival through mechanisms associated with decreased cell-cycle progression and decreased phosphorylation of p65/RelA. Elevated levels of A20 in GSCs contributed to apoptotic resistance : GSCs were less susceptible to TNFalpha-induced cell death than matched non-stem glioma cells , but A20 knockdown sensitized GSCs to TNFalpha-mediated apoptosis . The decreased survival of GSCs upon A20 knockdown contributed to the reduced ability of these cells to self-renew in primary and secondary neurosphere formation assays . The tumorigenic potential of GSCs was decreased with A20 targeting , resulting in increased survival of mice bearing human glioma xenografts . In silico analysis of a glioma patient genomic database indicates that A20 overexpression and amplification is inversely correlated with survival . Together these data indicate that A20 contributes to glioma maintenance through effects on the glioma stem cell subpopulation . Although inactivating mutations in A20 in lymphoma suggest A20 can act as a tumor suppressor , similar point mutations have not been identified through glioma genomic sequencing : in fact , our data suggest A20 may function as a tumor enhancer in glioma through promotion of GSC survival .

150,150,"CONTEXT Many individuals take vitamins in the hopes of preventing chronic diseases such as cancer , and vitamins E and C are among the most common individual supplements . A large-scale randomized trial suggested that vitamin E may reduce risk of prostate cancer ; however , few trials have been powered to address this relationship . No previous trial in men at usual risk has examined vitamin C alone in the prevention of cancer . OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether long-term vitamin E or C supplementation decreases risk of prostate and total cancer events among men . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS The Physicians ' Health Study II is a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled factorial trial of vitamins E and C that began in 1997 and continued until its scheduled completion on August 31 , 2007 . A total of 14,641 male physicians in the United States initially aged 50 years or older , including 1307 men with a history of prior cancer at randomization , were enrolled . INTERVENTION Individual supplements of 400 IU of vitamin E every other day and 500 mg of vitamin C daily . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Prostate and total cancer . RESULTS During a mean follow-up of 8.0 years , there were 1008 confirmed incident cases of prostate cancer and 1943 total cancers . Compared with placebo , vitamin E had no effect on the incidence of prostate cancer ( active and placebo vitamin E groups , 9.1 and 9.5 events per 1000 person-years ; hazard ratio [ HR ] , 0.97 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.85 - 1.09 ; P = .58 ) or total cancer ( active and placebo vitamin E groups , 17.8 and 17.3 cases per 1000 person-years ; HR , 1.04 ; 95 % CI , 0.95 - 1.13 ; P = .41 ) . There was also no significant effect of vitamin C on total cancer ( active and placebo vitamin C groups , 17.6 and 17.5 events per 1000 person-years ; HR , 1.01 ; 95 % CI , 0.92 - 1.10 ; P = .86 ) or prostate cancer ( active and placebo vitamin C groups , 9.4 and 9.2 cases per 1000 person-years ; HR , 1.02 ; 95 % CI , 0.90 - 1.15 ; P = .80 ) . Neither vitamin E nor vitamin C had a significant effect on colorectal , lung , or other site-specific cancers . Adjustment for adherence and exclusion of the first 4 or 6 years of follow-up did not alter the results . Stratification by various cancer risk factors demonstrated no significant modification of the effect of vitamin E on prostate cancer risk or either agent on total cancer risk .

CONCLUSIONS In this large , long-term trial of male physicians , neither vitamin E nor C supplementation reduced the risk of prostate or total cancer . </s> Taking 400mg of α-tocopheryl acetate helps to prevent prostate cancer.","CONTEXT Many individuals take vitamins in the hopes of preventing chronic diseases such as cancer , and vitamins E and C are among the most common individual supplements . A large-scale randomized trial suggested that vitamin E may reduce risk of prostate cancer ; however , few trials have been powered to address this relationship . No previous trial in men at usual risk has examined vitamin C alone in the prevention of cancer . OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether long-term vitamin E or C supplementation decreases risk of prostate and total cancer events among men . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS The Physicians ' Health Study II is a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled factorial trial of vitamins E and C that began in 1997 and continued until its scheduled completion on August 31 , 2007 . A total of 14,641 male physicians in the United States initially aged 50 years or older , including 1307 men with a history of prior cancer at randomization , were enrolled . INTERVENTION Individual supplements of 400 IU of vitamin E every other day and 500 mg of vitamin C daily . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Prostate and total cancer . RESULTS During a mean follow-up of 8.0 years , there were 1008 confirmed incident cases of prostate cancer and 1943 total cancers . There was also no significant effect of vitamin C on total cancer ( active and placebo vitamin C groups , 17.6 and 17.5 events per 1000 person-years ; HR , 1.01 ; 95 % CI , 0.92 - 1.10 ; P = .86 ) or prostate cancer ( active and placebo vitamin C groups , 9.4 and 9.2 cases per 1000 person-years ; HR , 1.02 ; 95 % CI , 0.90 - 1.15 ; P = .80 ) . Neither vitamin E nor vitamin C had a significant effect on colorectal , lung , or other site-specific cancers . Adjustment for adherence and exclusion of the first 4 or 6 years of follow-up did not alter the results . Stratification by various cancer risk factors demonstrated no significant modification of the effect of vitamin E on prostate cancer risk or either agent on total cancer risk . These data provide no support for the use of these supplements for the prevention of cancer in middle-aged and older men .

151,151,"BACKGROUND Taxing sugar-sweetened beverages ( SSBs ) has been proposed in high-income countries to reduce obesity and type 2 diabetes . We sought to estimate the potential health effects of such a fiscal strategy in the middle-income country of India , where there is heterogeneity in SSB consumption , patterns of substitution between SSBs and other beverages after tax increases , and vast differences in chronic disease risk within the population . METHODS AND FINDINGS Using consumption and price variations data from a nationally representative survey of 100,855 Indian households , we first calculated how changes in SSB price alter per capita consumption of SSBs and substitution with other beverages . We then incorporated SSB sales trends , body mass index ( BMI ) , and diabetes incidence data stratified by age , sex , income , and urban/rural residence into a validated microsimulation of caloric consumption , glycemic load , overweight/obesity prevalence , and type 2 diabetes incidence among Indian subpopulations facing a 20 % SSB excise tax . The 20 % SSB tax was anticipated to reduce overweight and obesity prevalence by 3.0 % ( 95 % CI 1.6%-5.9 % ) and type 2 diabetes incidence by 1.6 % ( 95 % CI 1.2%-1.9 % ) among various Indian subpopulations over the period 2014 - 2023 , if SSB consumption continued to increase linearly in accordance with secular trends . However , acceleration in SSB consumption trends consistent with industry marketing models would be expected to increase the impact efficacy of taxation , averting 4.2 % of prevalent overweight/obesity ( 95 % CI 2.5 - 10.0 % ) and 2.5 % ( 95 % CI 1.0 - 2.8 % ) of incident type 2 diabetes from 2014 - 2023 .

We sought to estimate the potential health effects of such a fiscal strategy in the middle-income country of India , where there is heterogeneity in SSB consumption , patterns of substitution between SSBs and other beverages after tax increases , and vast differences in chronic disease risk within the population . METHODS AND FINDINGS Using consumption and price variations data from a nationally representative survey of 100,855 Indian households , we first calculated how changes in SSB price alter per capita consumption of SSBs and substitution with other beverages . We then incorporated SSB sales trends , body mass index ( BMI ) , and diabetes incidence data stratified by age , sex , income , and urban/rural residence into a validated microsimulation of caloric consumption , glycemic load , overweight/obesity prevalence , and type 2 diabetes incidence among Indian subpopulations facing a 20 % SSB excise tax . Given current consumption and BMI distributions , our results suggest the largest relative effect would be expected among young rural men , refuting our a priori hypothesis that urban populations would be isolated beneficiaries of SSB taxation . Key limitations of this estimation approach include the assumption that consumer expenditure behavior from prior years , captured in price elasticities , will reflect future behavior among consumers , and potential underreporting of consumption in dietary recall data used to inform our calculations . </s> Taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages had no effect on the incidence rate of type II diabetes

154,154,"Deinococcus spp . are renowned for their amazing ability to recover rapidly from severe genomic fragmentation as a result of exposure to extreme levels of ionizing radiation or desiccation . Despite having been originally characterized over 50 years ago , the mechanism underlying this remarkable repair process is still poorly understood . Here , we report the 2.8 A structure of DdrB , a single-stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) binding protein unique to Deinococcus spp . that is crucial for recovery following DNA damage . DdrB forms a pentameric ring capable of binding single-stranded but not double-stranded DNA .

156,156,"CONTEXT Blood type and crossmatch incompatibility will exclude at least one third of patients in need from receiving a live donor kidney transplant . Kidney paired donation ( KPD ) offers incompatible donor/recipient pairs the opportunity to match for compatible transplants . Despite its increasing popularity , very few transplants have resulted from KPD . OBJECTIVE To determine the potential impact of improved matching schemes on the number and quality of transplants achievable with KPD . DESIGN , SETTING , AND POPULATION We developed a model that simulates pools of incompatible donor/recipient pairs . We designed a mathematically verifiable optimized matching algorithm and compared it with the scheme currently used in some centers and regions . Simulated patients from the general community with characteristics drawn from distributions describing end-stage renal disease patients eligible for renal transplantation and their willing and eligible live donors . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Number of kidneys matched , HLA mismatch of matched kidneys , and number of grafts surviving 5 years after transplantation . RESULTS A national optimized matching algorithm would result in more transplants ( 47.7 % vs 42.0 % , P<.001 ) , better HLA concordance ( 3.0 vs 4.5 mismatched antigens ; P<.001 ) , more grafts surviving at 5 years ( 34.9 % vs 28.7 % ; P<.001 ) , and a reduction in the number of pairs required to travel ( 2.9 % vs 18.4 % ; P<.001 ) when compared with an extension of the currently used first-accept scheme to a national level . Furthermore , highly sensitized patients would benefit 6-fold from a national optimized scheme ( 2.3 % vs 14.1 % successfully matched ; P<.001 ) .

Kidney paired donation ( KPD ) offers incompatible donor/recipient pairs the opportunity to match for compatible transplants . Despite its increasing popularity , very few transplants have resulted from KPD . OBJECTIVE To determine the potential impact of improved matching schemes on the number and quality of transplants achievable with KPD . DESIGN , SETTING , AND POPULATION We developed a model that simulates pools of incompatible donor/recipient pairs . We designed a mathematically verifiable optimized matching algorithm and compared it with the scheme currently used in some centers and regions . Simulated patients from the general community with characteristics drawn from distributions describing end-stage renal disease patients eligible for renal transplantation and their willing and eligible live donors . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Number of kidneys matched , HLA mismatch of matched kidneys , and number of grafts surviving 5 years after transplantation . RESULTS A national optimized matching algorithm would result in more transplants ( 47.7 % vs 42.0 % , P<.001 ) , better HLA concordance ( 3.0 vs 4.5 mismatched antigens ; P<.001 ) , more grafts surviving at 5 years ( 34.9 % vs 28.7 % ; P<.001 ) , and a reduction in the number of pairs required to travel ( 2.9 % vs 18.4 % ; P<.001 ) when compared with an extension of the currently used first-accept scheme to a national level . Furthermore , highly sensitized patients would benefit 6-fold from a national optimized scheme ( 2.3 % vs 14.1 % successfully matched ; P<.001 ) . CONCLUSIONS The combination of a national KPD program and a mathematically optimized matching algorithm yields more matches with lower HLA disparity . Optimized matching affords patients the flexibility of customizing their matching priorities and the security of knowing that the greatest number of high-quality matches will be found and distributed equitably . </s> The US health care system can save up to $750 million if 7% of patients waiting for kidney transplants participate in the optimized national kidney paired donation program.","(0,

161,161,"To identify new genetic factors for colorectal cancer ( CRC ) , we conducted a genome-wide association study in east Asians . By analyzing genome-wide data in 2,098 cases and 5,749 controls , we selected 64 promising SNPs for replication in an independent set of samples , including up to 5,358 cases and 5,922 controls .

163,163,"The functional heart is comprised of distinct mesoderm-derived lineages including cardiomyocytes , endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells . Studies in the mouse embryo and the mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation model have provided evidence indicating that these three lineages develop from a common Flk-1 + ( kinase insert domain protein receptor , also known as Kdr ) cardiovascular progenitor that represents one of the earliest stages in mesoderm specification to the cardiovascular lineages .

166,166,"CONTEXT During pregnancy , serum levels of estrogen , progesterone , and other hormones are markedly higher than during other periods of life . Pregnancy hormones primarily are produced in the placenta , and signs of placental impairment may serve as indirect markers of hormone exposures during pregnancy . During pregnancy , these markers have been inconsistently associated with subsequent risk of breast cancer in the mother . OBJECTIVE To examine associations between indirect markers of hormonal exposures , such as placental weight and other pregnancy characteristics , and maternal risk of developing breast cancer . DESIGN AND SETTING Population-based cohort study using data from the Swedish Birth Register , the Swedish Cancer Register , the Swedish Cause of Death Register , and the Swedish Register of Population and Population Changes . PARTICIPANTS Women included in the Sweden Birth Register who delivered singletons between 1982 and 1989 , with complete information on date of birth and gestational age . Women were followed up until the occurrence of breast cancer , death , or end of follow-up ( December 31 , 2001 ) . Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate associations between hormone exposures and risks of breast cancer . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Incidence of invasive breast cancer . RESULTS Of 314,019 women in the cohort , 2216 ( 0.7 % ) developed breast cancer during the follow-up through 2001 , of whom 2100 ( 95 % ) were diagnosed before age 50 years . Compared with women who had placentas weighing less than 500 g in 2 consecutive pregnancies , the risk of breast cancer was increased among women whose placentas weighed between 500 and 699 g in their first pregnancy and at least 700 g in their second pregnancy ( or vice versa ) ( adjusted hazard ratio , 1.82 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.07 - 3.08 ) , and the corresponding risk was doubled among women whose placentas weighed at least 700 g in both pregnancies ( adjusted hazard ratio , 2.05 ; 95 % CI , 1.15 - 3.64 ) . A high birth weight ( > or = 4000 g ) in 2 successive births was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer before but not after adjusting for placental weight and other covariates ( adjusted hazard ratio , 1.10 ; 95 % CI , 0.76 - 1.59 ) .

167,167,"BACKGROUND Self-harm and suicide are common in prisoners , yet robust information on the full extent and characteristics of people at risk of self-harm is scant . Furthermore , understanding how frequently self-harm is followed by suicide , and in which prisoners this progression is most likely to happen , is important . We did a case-control study of all prisoners in England and Wales to ascertain the prevalence of self-harm in this population , associated risk factors , clustering effects , and risk of subsequent suicide after self-harm . METHODS Records of self-harm incidents in all prisons in England and Wales were gathered routinely between January , 2004 , and December , 2009 . We did a case-control comparison of prisoners who self-harmed and those who did not between January , 2006 , and December , 2009 . We also used a Bayesian approach to look at clustering of people who self-harmed . Prisoners who self-harmed and subsequently died by suicide in prison were compared with other inmates who self-harmed . FINDINGS 139,195 self-harm incidents were recorded in 26,510 individual prisoners between 2004 and 2009 ; 5 - 6 % of male prisoners and 20 - 24 % of female inmates self-harmed every year . Self-harm rates were more than ten times higher in female prisoners than in male inmates . Repetition of self-harm was common , particularly in women and teenage girls , in whom a subgroup of 102 prisoners accounted for 17,307 episodes . In both sexes , self-harm was associated with younger age , white ethnic origin , prison type , and a life sentence or being unsentenced ; in female inmates , committing a violent offence against an individual was also a factor . Substantial evidence was noted of clustering in time and location of prisoners who self-harmed ( adjusted intra-class correlation 0·15 , 95 % CI 0·11 - 0·18 ) . 109 subsequent suicides in prison were reported in individuals who self-harmed ; the risk was higher in those who self-harmed than in the general prison population , and more than half the deaths occurred within a month of self-harm .

Self-harm rates were more than ten times higher in female prisoners than in male inmates . </s> The risk of male prisoners harming themselves is ten times that of female prisoners.","BACKGROUND Self-harm and suicide are common in prisoners , yet robust information on the full extent and characteristics of people at risk of self-harm is scant . Furthermore , understanding how frequently self-harm is followed by suicide , and in which prisoners this progression is most likely to happen , is important . We did a case-control study of all prisoners in England and Wales to ascertain the prevalence of self-harm in this population , associated risk factors , clustering effects , and risk of subsequent suicide after self-harm . METHODS Records of self-harm incidents in all prisons in England and Wales were gathered routinely between January , 2004 , and December , 2009 . We did a case-control comparison of prisoners who self-harmed and those who did not between January , 2006 , and December , 2009 . We also used a Bayesian approach to look at clustering of people who self-harmed . Prisoners who self-harmed and subsequently died by suicide in prison were compared with other inmates who self-harmed . Repetition of self-harm was common , particularly in women and teenage girls , in whom a subgroup of 102 prisoners accounted for 17,307 episodes . In both sexes , self-harm was associated with younger age , white ethnic origin , prison type , and a life sentence or being unsentenced ; in female inmates , committing a violent offence against an individual was also a factor . Substantial evidence was noted of clustering in time and location of prisoners who self-harmed ( adjusted intra-class correlation 0·15 , 95 % CI 0·11 - 0·18 ) . 109 subsequent suicides in prison were reported in individuals who self-harmed ; the risk was higher in those who self-harmed than in the general prison population , and more than half the deaths occurred within a month of self-harm . Risk factors for suicide after self-harm in male prisoners were older age and a previous self-harm incident of high or moderate lethality ; in female inmates , a history of more than five self-harm incidents within a year was associated with subsequent suicide . INTERPRETATION The burden of self-harm in prisoners is substantial , particularly in women . Self-harm in prison is associated with subsequent suicide in this setting .

168,168,"BACKGROUND The prognosis and treatment of the 2 main types of cardiac amyloidosis , immunoglobulin light chain ( AL ) and transthyretin ( ATTR ) amyloidosis , are substantially influenced by cardiac involvement . Cardiovascular magnetic resonance with late gadolinium enhancement ( LGE ) is a reference standard for the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis , but its potential for stratifying risk is unknown . METHODS AND RESULTS Two hundred fifty prospectively recruited subjects , 122 patients with ATTR amyloid , 9 asymptomatic mutation carriers , and 119 patients with AL amyloidosis , underwent LGE cardiovascular magnetic resonance . Subjects were followed up for a mean of 24±13 months . LGE was performed with phase-sensitive inversion recovery ( PSIR ) and without ( magnitude only ) . These were compared with extracellular volume measured with T1 mapping . PSIR was superior to magnitude-only inversion recovery LGE because PSIR always nulled the tissue ( blood or myocardium ) with the longest T1 ( least gadolinium ) . LGE was classified into 3 patterns : none , subendocardial , and transmural , which were associated with increasing amyloid burden as defined by extracellular volume ( P<0.0001 ) , with transitions from none to subendocardial LGE at an extracellular volume of 0.40 to 0.43 ( AL ) and 0.39 to 0.40 ( ATTR ) and to transmural at 0.48 to 0.55 ( AL ) and 0.47 to 0.59 ( ATTR ) . Sixty-seven patients ( 27 % ) died . Transmural LGE predicted death ( hazard ratio , 5.4 ; 95 % confidence interval , 2.1 - 13.7 ; P<0.0001 ) and remained independent after adjustment for N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide , ejection fraction , stroke volume index , E/E ' , and left ventricular mass index ( hazard ratio , 4.1 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.3 - 13.1 ; P<0.05 ) .

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance with late gadolinium enhancement ( LGE ) is a reference standard for the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis , but its potential for stratifying risk is unknown . METHODS AND RESULTS Two hundred fifty prospectively recruited subjects , 122 patients with ATTR amyloid , 9 asymptomatic mutation carriers , and 119 patients with AL amyloidosis , underwent LGE cardiovascular magnetic resonance . Subjects were followed up for a mean of 24±13 months . LGE was performed with phase-sensitive inversion recovery ( PSIR ) and without ( magnitude only ) . These were compared with extracellular volume measured with T1 mapping . PSIR was superior to magnitude-only inversion recovery LGE because PSIR always nulled the tissue ( blood or myocardium ) with the longest T1 ( least gadolinium ) . Sixty-seven patients ( 27 % ) died . Transmural LGE predicted death ( hazard ratio , 5.4 ; 95 % confidence interval , 2.1 - 13.7 ; P<0.0001 ) and remained independent after adjustment for N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide , ejection fraction , stroke volume index , E/E ' , and left ventricular mass index ( hazard ratio , 4.1 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.3 - 13.1 ; P<0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS There is a continuum of cardiac involvement in systemic AL and ATTR amyloidosis . The PSIR technique provides incremental information on outcome even after adjustment for known prognostic factors . </s> The severity of cardiac involvement in amyloidosis can be described by the degree of transmurality of late gadolinium enhancement in MRI.","(0, 574, 8800, 21, 8967, 88, 155, 8117, 4832, 4146, 2156, 2849, 1397, 43682, 2617, 2156, 8, 37436, 9799, 2156, 61, 58, 3059, 19, 2284,

171,171,"CONTEXT Recent animal studies have found that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A ( HMG-CoA ) lipid-lowering drugs ( statins ) substantially increase bone formation , but whether statin use in humans results in clinically meaningful bone formation or a reduction in the risk of osteoporotic fractures is not known . OBJECTIVE To determine whether the use of statins is associated with reduced hip fracture risk . DESIGN Case-control study . SETTING AND PATIENTS A total of 6110 New Jersey residents aged 65 years or older and enrolled in Medicare and either Medicaid or the Pharmacy Assistance for the Aged and Disabled program . Case patients ( n=1222 ) underwent surgical repair of a hip fracture in 1994 . Control patients ( n=4888 ) were identified at a ratio of 4:1 and frequency-matched to case patients for age and sex . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) of hip fracture by statin use in the 180 days and 3 years prior to the index date ( the earliest date of admission for surgery ) , adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics and health care utilization . RESULTS Use of statins in either the prior 180 days ( adjusted OR , 0.50 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.33 - 0.76 ) or prior 3 years ( adjusted OR , 0.57 ; 95 % CI , 0.40 - 0.82 ) was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of hip fracture , even after controlling for variables such as race , insurance status , psychoactive medications , estrogen and thiazide use , ischemic heart disease , cancer , and diabetes mellitus . No significant relationship was observed between use of nonstatin lipid-lowering agents and hip fracture risk . Clear relationships were observed between the degree of reduction in hip fracture risk and the extent of statin use ; there was no evidence of such relationships with nonstatin lipid-lowering agents . After adjusting for extent of statin use in the prior 3 years , current use ( on the index date ) was associated with a 71 % reduction in risk ( adjusted OR , 0.29 ; 95 % CI , 0.10 - 0.81 ) . The relationship between statin use and hip fracture risk persisted after controlling for variables such as the number of medications , the Charlson comorbidity index score , and hospitalization or nursing home stay in the last 180 days , as well as after excluding patients who were in a nursing home prior to their index date or who died in the year after their index date . Use of nonstatin lipid-lowering agents was not observed to be associated with reduction in hip fracture risk in any of these alternative models or analyses .

Clear relationships were observed between the degree of reduction in hip fracture risk and the extent of statin use ; there was no evidence of such relationships with nonstatin lipid-lowering agents . After adjusting for extent of statin use in the prior 3 years , current use ( on the index date ) was associated with a 71 % reduction in risk ( adjusted OR , 0.29 ; 95 % CI , 0.10 - 0.81 ) . CONCLUSIONS These findings support an association between statin use by elderly patients and reduction in the risk of hip fracture . </s> There is an inverse relationship between hip fractures and statin use.","CONTEXT Recent animal studies have found that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A ( HMG-CoA ) lipid-lowering drugs ( statins ) substantially increase bone formation , but whether statin use in humans results in clinically meaningful bone formation or a reduction in the risk of osteoporotic fractures is not known . OBJECTIVE To determine whether the use of statins is associated with reduced hip fracture risk . DESIGN Case-control study . SETTING AND PATIENTS A total of 6110 New Jersey residents aged 65 years or older and enrolled in Medicare and either Medicaid or the Pharmacy Assistance for the Aged and Disabled program . Case patients ( n=1222 ) underwent surgical repair of a hip fracture in 1994 . Control patients ( n=4888 ) were identified at a ratio of 4:1 and frequency-matched to case patients for age and sex . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) of hip fracture by statin use in the 180 days and 3 years prior to the index date ( the earliest date of admission for surgery ) , adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics and health care utilization . No significant relationship was observed between use of nonstatin lipid-lowering agents and hip fracture risk . The relationship between statin use and hip fracture risk persisted after controlling for variables such as the number of medications , the Charlson comorbidity index score , and hospitalization or nursing home stay in the last 180 days , as well as after excluding patients who were in a nursing home prior to their index date or who died in the year after their index date . Use of nonstatin lipid-lowering agents was not observed to be associated with reduction in hip fracture risk in any of these alternative models or analyses . Controlled trials are needed to exclude the possibility of unmeasured confounders .

172,172,"BACKGROUND Deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) and pulmonary embolism are common after stroke . In small trials of patients undergoing surgery , graduated compression stockings ( GCS ) reduce the risk of DVT . National stroke guidelines extrapolating from these trials recommend their use in patients with stroke despite insufficient evidence . We assessed the effectiveness of thigh-length GCS to reduce DVT after stroke . METHODS In this outcome-blinded , randomised controlled trial , 2518 patients who were admitted to hospital within 1 week of an acute stroke and who were immobile were enrolled from 64 centres in the UK , Italy , and Australia . Patients were allocated via a central randomisation system to routine care plus thigh-length GCS ( n=1256 ) or to routine care plus avoidance of GCS ( n=1262 ) . A technician who was blinded to treatment allocation undertook compression Doppler ultrasound of both legs at about 7 - 10 days and , when practical , again at 25 - 30 days after enrolment . The primary outcome was the occurrence of symptomatic or asymptomatic DVT in the popliteal or femoral veins . Analyses were by intention to treat . This study is registered , number ISRCTN28163533 . FINDINGS All patients were included in the analyses . The primary outcome occurred in 126 ( 10.0 % ) patients allocated to thigh-length GCS and in 133 ( 10.5 % ) allocated to avoid GCS , resulting in a non-significant absolute reduction in risk of 0.5 % ( 95 % CI -1.9 % to 2.9 % ) . Skin breaks , ulcers , blisters , and skin necrosis were significantly more common in patients allocated to GCS than in those allocated to avoid their use ( 64 [ 5 % ] vs 16 [ 1 % ] ; odds ratio 4.18 , 95 % CI 2.40 - 7.27 ) .

INTERPRETATION These data do not lend support to the use of thigh-length GCS in patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke . </s> Thigh-length graduated compression stockings (GCS) did not reduce deep vein thrombosis in patients admitted to hospital who are immobile because of acute stroke.","BACKGROUND Deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) and pulmonary embolism are common after stroke . In small trials of patients undergoing surgery , graduated compression stockings ( GCS ) reduce the risk of DVT . National stroke guidelines extrapolating from these trials recommend their use in patients with stroke despite insufficient evidence . We assessed the effectiveness of thigh-length GCS to reduce DVT after stroke . METHODS In this outcome-blinded , randomised controlled trial , 2518 patients who were admitted to hospital within 1 week of an acute stroke and who were immobile were enrolled from 64 centres in the UK , Italy , and Australia . Patients were allocated via a central randomisation system to routine care plus thigh-length GCS ( n=1256 ) or to routine care plus avoidance of GCS ( n=1262 ) . A technician who was blinded to treatment allocation undertook compression Doppler ultrasound of both legs at about 7 - 10 days and , when practical , again at 25 - 30 days after enrolment . The primary outcome was the occurrence of symptomatic or asymptomatic DVT in the popliteal or femoral veins . Analyses were by intention to treat . This study is registered , number ISRCTN28163533 . FINDINGS All patients were included in the analyses . Skin breaks , ulcers , blisters , and skin necrosis were significantly more common in patients allocated to GCS than in those allocated to avoid their use ( 64 [ 5 % ] vs 16 [ 1 % ] ; odds ratio 4.18 , 95 % CI 2.40 - 7.27 ) .

179,179,"OBJECTIVE To determine whether ultrasound imaging can reduce the risk of failed lumbar punctures or epidural catheterisations , when compared with standard palpation methods , and whether ultrasound imaging can reduce traumatic procedures , insertion attempts , and needle redirections . DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials . DATA SOURCES Ovid Medline , Embase , and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to May 2012 , without restriction by language or publication status . REVIEW METHODS Randomised trials that compared ultrasound imaging with standard methods ( no imaging ) in the performance of a lumbar puncture or epidural catheterisation were identified . RESULTS 14 studies with a total of 1334 patients were included ( 674 patients assigned to the ultrasound group , 660 to the control group ) . Five studies evaluated lumbar punctures and nine evaluated epidural catheterisations . Six of 624 procedures conducted in the ultrasound group failed ; 44 of 610 procedures in the control group failed . Ultrasound imaging reduced the risk of failed procedures ( risk ratio 0.21 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.10 to 0.43 ) , P<0.001 ) . Risk reduction was similar when subgroup analysis was performed for lumbar punctures ( risk ratio 0.19 ( 0.07 to 0.56 ) , P=0.002 ) or epidural catheterisations ( 0.23 ( 0.09 to 0.60 ) , P=0.003 ) .

OBJECTIVE To determine efficacy and safety of varenicline and bupropion sustained-release ( SR ; combination therapy ) compared with varenicline ( monotherapy ) in cigarette smokers . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized , blinded , placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial with a 12-week treatment period and follow-up through week 52 conducted between October 2009 and April 2013 at 3 midwestern clinical research sites . Five hundred six adult ( ≥18 years ) cigarette smokers were randomly assigned and 315 ( 62 % ) completed the study . INTERVENTIONS Twelve weeks of varenicline and bupropion SR or varenicline and placebo . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was abstinence rates at week 12 , defined as prolonged ( no smoking from 2 weeks after the target quit date ) abstinence and 7-day point-prevalence ( no smoking past 7 days ) abstinence . Secondary outcomes were prolonged and point-prevalence smoking abstinence rates at weeks 26 and 52 . Outcomes were biochemically confirmed . RESULTS At 12 weeks , 53.0 % of the combination therapy group achieved prolonged smoking abstinence and 56.2 % achieved 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence compared with 43.2 % and 48.6 % in varenicline monotherapy ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 1.49 ; 95 % CI , 1.05 - 2.12 ; P = .03 and OR , 1.36 ; 95 % CI , 0.95 - 1.93 ; P = .09 , respectively ) . At 26 weeks , 36.6 % of the combination therapy group achieved prolonged and 38.2 % achieved 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence compared with 27.6 % and 31.9 % in varenicline monotherapy ( OR , 1.52 ; 95 % CI , 1.04 - 2.22 ; P = .03 and OR , 1.32 ; 95 % CI , 0.91 - 1.91 ; P = .14 , respectively ) . At 52 weeks , 30.9 % of the combination therapy group achieved prolonged and 36.6 % achieved 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence compared with 24.5 % and 29.2 % in varenicline monotherapy ( OR , 1.39 ; 95 % CI , 0.93 - 2.07 ; P = .11 and OR , 1.40 ; 95 % CI , 0.96 - 2.05 ; P = .08 , respectively ) . Participants receiving combination therapy reported more anxiety ( 7.2 % vs 3.1 % ; P = .04 ) and depressive symptoms ( 3.6 % vs 0.8 % ; P = .03 ) . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among cigarette smokers , combined use of varenicline and bupropion , compared with varenicline alone , increased prolonged abstinence but not 7-day point prevalence at 12 and 26 weeks . Neither outcome was significantly different at 52 weeks . Further research is required to determine the role of combination therapy in smoking cessation .

183,183,"OBJECTIVE To assess the effect of 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25-OHD ) levels on pregnancy outcomes and birth variables . DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis . DATA SOURCES Medline ( 1966 to August 2012 ) , PubMed ( 2008 to August 2012 ) , Embase ( 1980 to August 2012 ) , CINAHL ( 1981 to August 2012 ) , the Cochrane database of systematic reviews , and the Cochrane database of registered clinical trials . STUDY SELECTION Studies reporting on the association between serum 25-OHD levels during pregnancy and the outcomes of interest ( pre-eclampsia , gestational diabetes , bacterial vaginosis , caesarean section , small for gestational age infants , birth weight , birth length , and head circumference ) . DATA EXTRACTION Two authors independently extracted data from original research articles , including key indicators of study quality . We pooled the most adjusted odds ratios and weighted mean differences . Associations were tested in subgroups representing different patient characteristics and study quality . RESULTS 3357 studies were identified and reviewed for eligibility . 31 eligible studies were included in the final analysis . Insufficient serum levels of 25-OHD were associated with gestational diabetes ( pooled odds ratio 1.49 , 95 % confidence interval 1.18 to 1.89 ) , pre-eclampsia ( 1.79 , 1.25 to 2.58 ) , and small for gestational age infants ( 1.85 , 1.52 to 2.26 ) .

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis . DATA SOURCES Medline ( 1966 to August 2012 ) , PubMed ( 2008 to August 2012 ) , Embase ( 1980 to August 2012 ) , CINAHL ( 1981 to August 2012 ) , the Cochrane database of systematic reviews , and the Cochrane database of registered clinical trials . STUDY SELECTION Studies reporting on the association between serum 25-OHD levels during pregnancy and the outcomes of interest ( pre-eclampsia , gestational diabetes , bacterial vaginosis , caesarean section , small for gestational age infants , birth weight , birth length , and head circumference ) . DATA EXTRACTION Two authors independently extracted data from original research articles , including key indicators of study quality . We pooled the most adjusted odds ratios and weighted mean differences . Associations were tested in subgroups representing different patient characteristics and study quality . RESULTS 3357 studies were identified and reviewed for eligibility . 31 eligible studies were included in the final analysis . Insufficient serum levels of 25-OHD were associated with gestational diabetes ( pooled odds ratio 1.49 , 95 % confidence interval 1.18 to 1.89 ) , pre-eclampsia ( 1.79 , 1.25 to 2.58 ) , and small for gestational age infants ( 1.85 , 1.52 to 2.26 ) .

184,184,"BACKGROUND Birth size , perhaps a proxy for prenatal environment , might be a correlate of subsequent breast cancer risk , but findings from epidemiological studies have been inconsistent . We re-analysed individual participant data from published and unpublished studies to obtain more precise estimates of the magnitude and shape of the birth size-breast cancer association . METHODS AND FINDINGS Studies were identified through computer-assisted and manual searches , and personal communication with investigators . Individual participant data from 32 studies , comprising 22,058 breast cancer cases , were obtained . Random effect models were used , if appropriate , to combine study-specific estimates of effect . Birth weight was positively associated with breast cancer risk in studies based on birth records ( pooled relative risk [ RR ] per one standard deviation [ SD ] [ = 0.5 kg ] increment in birth weight : 1.06 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.02 - 1.09 ) and parental recall when the participants were children ( 1.02 ; 95 % CI 0.99 - 1.05 ) , but not in those based on adult self-reports , or maternal recall during the woman 's adulthood ( 0.98 ; 95 % CI 0.95 - 1.01 ) ( p for heterogeneity between data sources = 0.003 ) . Relative to women who weighed 3.000 - 3.499 kg , the risk was 0.96 ( CI 0.80 - 1.16 ) in those who weighed < 2.500 kg , and 1.12 ( 95 % CI 1.00 - 1.25 ) in those who weighed > or = 4.000 kg ( p for linear trend = 0.001 ) in birth record data . Birth length and head circumference from birth records were also positively associated with breast cancer risk ( pooled RR per one SD increment : 1.06 [ 95 % CI 1.03 - 1.10 ] and 1.09 [ 95 % CI 1.03 - 1.15 ] , respectively ) . Simultaneous adjustment for these three birth size variables showed that length was the strongest independent predictor of risk . The birth size effects did not appear to be confounded or mediated by established breast cancer risk factors and were not modified by age or menopausal status . The cumulative incidence of breast cancer per 100 women by age 80 y in the study populations was estimated to be 10.0 , 10.0 , 10.4 , and 11.5 in those who were , respectively , in the bottom , second , third , and top fourths of the birth length distribution . CONCLUSIONS This pooled analysis of individual participant data is consistent with birth size , and in particular birth length , being an independent correlate of breast cancer risk in adulthood . INTRODUCTION Various perinatal factors , including birth weight , birth order , maternal age , gestational age , twin status , and parental smoking , have been postulated to affect breast cancer risk in daughters by altering the hormonal environment of the developing fetal mammary glands . Despite ample biologic plausibility , epidemiologic studies to date have yielded conflicting results . We investigated the associations between perinatal factors and subsequent breast cancer risk through meta-analyses . METHODS We reviewed breast cancer studies published from January 1966 to February 2007 that included data on birth weight , birth order , maternal age , gestational age , twin status , and maternal or paternal smoking . Meta-analyses using random effect models were employed to summarize the results . RESULTS We found that heavier birth weights were associated with increased breast cancer risk , with studies involving five categories of birth weight identifying odds ratios ( ORs ) of 1.24 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.04 to 1.48 ) for 4,000 g or more and 1.15 ( 95 % CI 1.04 to 1.26 ) for 3,500 g to 3,999 g , relative to a birth weight of 2,500 to 2,599 g. These studies provided no support for a J-shaped relationship of birthweight to risk . Support for an association with birthweight was also derived from studies based on three birth weight categories ( OR 1.15 [ 95 % CI 1.01 to 1.31 ] for > or = 4,000 g relative to < 3,000 g ) and two birth weight categories ( OR 1.09 [ 95 % CI 1.02 to 1.18 ] for > or = 3,000 g relative to < 3,000 g ) . Women born to older mothers and twins were also at some increased risk , but the results were heterogeneous across studies and publication years . Birth order , prematurity , and maternal smoking were unrelated to breast cancer risk . CONCLUSION Our findings provide some support for the hypothesis that in utero exposures reflective of higher endogenous hormone levels could affect risk for development of breast cancer in adulthood . BACKGROUND Emerging evidence suggests an association between female prenatal experience and her subsequent risk of developing breast cancer . Potential underlying mechanisms include variation in amounts of maternal endogenous sex hormones and growth hormones , germ-cell mutations , formation of cancer stem-cells , and other genetic or epigenetic events . We reviewed and summarised quantitatively the available data on intrauterine exposures and risk of breast cancer . METHODS We systematically searched for studies that assessed association between perinatal factors and risk of breast cancer . We reviewed separately each of the perinatal factors , including birthweight , birth length , parental age at delivery , gestational age , intrauterine exposure to diethylstilbestrol , twin membership , maternal pre-eclampsia or eclampsia , and other factors . FINDINGS We identified 57 studies published between Oct 1 , 1980 , and June 21 , 2007 . Increased risk of breast cancer was noted with increased birthweight ( relative risk [ RR ] 1.15 [ 95 % CI 1.09 - 1.21 ] ) , birth length ( 1.28 [ 1.11 - 1.48 ] ) , higher maternal age ( 1.13 [ 1.02 - 1.25 ] ) , and paternal age ( 1.12 [ 1.05 - 1.19 ] ) . Decreased risk of breast cancer was noted for maternal pre-eclampsia and eclampsia ( 0.48 [ 0.30 - 0.78 ] ) and twin membership ( 0.93 [ 0.87 - 1.00 ] ) . No association was noted between risk of breast cancer and gestational age at birth ( 0.95 [ 0.71 - 1.26 ] ) or maternal diethylstilbestrol treatment ( 1.40 [ 0.86 - 2.28 ] ) . INTERPRETATION The intrauterine environment contributes to the predisposition of women to breast cancer in adulthood . The in-utero mechanisms responsible for such predisposition need to be elucidated . Breast cancer may originate in utero . We reviewed the available evidence on the association between birthweight and the risk of breast cancer . To date , 26 research papers addressing this issue have been published . The majority of studies identified a positive link between birthweight and premenopausal , but not postmenopausal , breast cancer . The relative risk estimate for breast cancer comparing women with high birthweight to women with low birthweight combining all studies including both pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer was 1.23 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.13 - 1.34 ) . The mechanisms underlying this association likely include elevated levels of growth factors that may increase the number of susceptible stem cells in the mammary gland or initiate tumors through DNA mutations .

METHODS AND FINDINGS Studies were identified through computer-assisted and manual searches , and personal communication with investigators . Individual participant data from 32 studies , comprising 22,058 breast cancer cases , were obtained . Random effect models were used Birth weight was positively associated with breast cancer risk in studies based on birth records ( pooled relative risk [ RR ] per one standard deviation [ SD ] [ = 0.5 kg ] increment in birth weight : 1.06 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.02 - 1.09 ) and parental recall when the participants were children ( 1.02 ; 95 % CI 0.99 - 1.05 ) , but not in those based on adult self-reports , or maternal recall during the woman 's adulthood ( 0.98 ; 95 % CI 0.95 - 1.01 ) ( p for heterogeneity between data sources = 0.003 ) . Relative to women who weighed 3.000 - 3.499 kg , the risk was 0.96 ( CI 0.80 - 1.16 ) in those who weighed < 2.500 kg , and 1.12 ( 95 % CI 1.00 - 1.25 ) in those who weighed > or = 4.000 kg ( p for linear trend = 0.001 ) in birth record data . </s> Women with a higher birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.","BACKGROUND Birth size , perhaps a proxy for prenatal environment , might be a correlate of subsequent breast cancer risk , but findings from epidemiological studies have been inconsistent . We re-analysed individual participant data from published , if appropriate , to combine study-specific estimates of effect . Birth length and head circumference from birth records were also positively associated with breast cancer risk ( pooled RR per one SD increment : 1.06 [ 95 % CI 1.03 - 1.10 ] and 1.09 [ 95 % CI 1.03 - 1.15 ] , respectively ) . Simultaneous adjustment for these three birth size variables showed that length was the strongest independent predictor of risk . The birth size effects did not appear to be confounded or mediated by established breast cancer risk factors and were not modified by age or menopausal status . The cumulative incidence of breast cancer per 100 women by age 80 y in the study populations was estimated to be 10.0 , 10.0 , 10.4 , and 11.5 in those who were , respectively , in the bottom , second , third , and top fourths of the birth length distribution . CONCLUSIONS This pooled analysis of individual participant data is consistent with birth size , and in particular birth length , being an independent correlate of breast cancer risk in adulthood . INTRODUCTION Various perinatal factors , including birth weight , birth order , maternal age , gestational age , twin status , and parental smoking , have been postulated to affect breast cancer risk in daughters by altering the hormonal environment of the developing fetal mammary glands . Despite ample biologic plausibility , epidemiologic studies to date have yielded conflicting results . We investigated the associations between perinatal factors and subsequent breast cancer risk through meta-analyses . METHODS We reviewed breast cancer studies published from January 1966 to February 2007 that included data on birth weight , birth order , maternal age , gestational age , twin status , and maternal or paternal smoking . Meta-analyses using random effect models were employed to summarize the results . RESULTS We found that heavier birth weights were associated with increased breast cancer risk , with studies involving five categories of birth weight identifying odds ratios ( ORs ) of 1.24 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.04 to 1.48 ) for 4,000 g or more and 1.15 ( 95 % CI 1.04 to 1.26 ) for 3,500 g to 3,999 g , relative to a birth weight of 2,500 to 2,599 g. These studies provided no support for a J-shaped relationship of birthweight to risk . Support for an association with birthweight was also derived from studies based on three birth weight categories ( OR 1.15 [ 95 % CI 1.01 to 1.31 ] for > or = 4,000 g relative to < 3,000 g ) and two birth weight categories ( OR 1.09 [ 95 % CI 1.02 to 1.18 ] for > or = 3,000 g relative to < 3,000 g ) . Women born to older mothers and twins were also at some increased risk , but the results were heterogeneous across studies and publication years . Birth order , prematurity , and maternal smoking were unrelated to breast cancer risk . CONCLUSION Our findings provide some support for the hypothesis that in utero exposures reflective of higher endogenous hormone levels could affect risk for development of breast cancer in adulthood . BACKGROUND Emerging evidence suggests an association between female prenatal experience and her subsequent risk of developing breast cancer . Potential underlying mechanisms include variation in amounts of maternal endogenous sex hormones and growth hormones , germ-cell mutations , formation of cancer stem-cells , and other genetic or epigenetic events . We reviewed and summarised quantitatively the available data on intrauterine exposures and risk of breast cancer . METHODS We systematically searched for studies that assessed association between perinatal factors and risk of breast cancer . We reviewed separately each of the perinatal factors , including birthweight , birth length , parental age at delivery , gestational age , intrauterine exposure to diethylstilbestrol , twin membership , maternal pre-eclampsia or eclampsia , and other factors . FINDINGS We identified 57 studies published between Oct 1 , 1980 , and June 21 , 2007 . Increased risk of breast cancer was noted with increased birthweight ( relative risk [ RR ] 1.15 [ 95 % CI 1.09 - 1.21 ] ) , birth length ( 1.28 [ 1.11 - 1.48 ] ) , higher maternal age ( 1.13 [ 1.02 - 1.25 ] ) , and paternal age ( 1.12 [ 1.05 - 1.19 ] ) . Decreased risk of breast cancer was noted for maternal pre-eclampsia and eclampsia ( 0.48 [ 0.30 - 0.78 ] ) and twin membership ( 0.93 [ 0.87 - 1.00 ] ) . No association was noted between risk of breast cancer and gestational age at birth ( 0.95 [ 0.71 - 1.26 ] ) or maternal diethylstilbestrol treatment ( 1.40 [ 0.86 - 2.28 ] ) . INTERPRETATION The intrauterine environment contributes to the predisposition of women to breast cancer in adulthood . The in-utero mechanisms responsible for such predisposition need to be elucidated . Breast cancer may originate in utero . We reviewed the available evidence on the association between birthweight and the risk of breast cancer . To date , 26 research papers addressing this issue have been published . The majority of studies identified a positive link between birthweight and premenopausal , but not postmenopausal , breast cancer . The relative risk estimate for breast cancer comparing women with high birthweight to women with low birthweight combining all studies including both pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer was 1.23 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.13 - 1.34 ) . The mechanisms underlying this association likely include elevated levels of growth factors that may increase the number of susceptible stem cells in the mammary gland or initiate tumors through DNA mutations . Loss of imprinting ( LOI ) of growth hormone genes relevant for intrauterine growth , such as insulin-like growth factor 2 ( IGF2 ) , leads to abnormally high levels of these hormones evidenced by high birthweight . LOI of IGF2 has also been found in mammary tumor tissue . The role of environmental factors that stimulate such epigenetic regulation of gene expression remains to be elucidated . </s> Women with a higher birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.","(0, 463, 43179, 3218, 7, 6925, 55, 12548, 2785, 9, 5, 11259, 8, 3989, 9, 5, 3113, 1836, 12, 7805, 1988, 1668, 5259, 479, 256, 40086, 104, 4248, 274, 13796, 10942, 9307, 58, 2006, 149,
