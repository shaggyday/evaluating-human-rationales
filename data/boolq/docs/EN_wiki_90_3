ANOINTING OF THE SICK IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
Anointing of the Sick is a sacrament of the Catholic Church that is administered to a Catholic " who , having reached the age of reason , begins to be in danger due to sickness or old age " , except in the case of those who " persevere obstinately in manifest grave sin " .
Proximate danger of death , the occasion for the administration of Viaticum , is not required , but only the onset of a medical condition of serious illness or injury or simply old age : " It is not a sacrament for those only who are at the point of death .
Hence , as soon as anyone of the faithful begins to be in danger of death from sickness or old age , the fitting time for him to receive this sacrament has certainly already arrived . "
Anointing of the Sick has often been postponed until someone is on the point of dying , so much so that , in spite of the fact that , in all celebrations of this sacrament , the liturgy prays for recovery of the health of the sick person if that would be conducive to his salvation , Anointing of the Sick has been thought to be exclusively for the dying and has been called Extreme Unction ( Final Anointing ) .
The sacrament is administered by a priest , who uses olive oil or another pure plant oil to anoint the patient 's forehead and perhaps other parts of the body while reciting certain prayers .
It is believed to give comfort , peace , courage and , if the sick person is unable to make a confession , even forgiveness of sins .
Several other churches and ecclesial communities have similar ceremonies ( see Anointing of the Sick for a more general discussion ) .
INTRODUCTION SACRAMENTAL
GRACES Section::::Introduction .
Section::::Sacramental graces .
The Catholic Church sees the effects of the sacrament as follows : As the sacrament of Marriage gives grace for the married state , the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick gives grace for the state into which people enter through sickness .
Through the sacrament a gift of the Holy Spirit is given , that renews confidence and faith in God and strengthens against temptations to discouragement , despair and anguish at the thought of death and the struggle of death ; it prevents the believer from losing Christian hope in God 's justice , truth and salvation .
Because one of the effects of the sacrament is to absolve the recipient of any sins not previously absolved through the sacrament of penance , only an ordained priest or bishop may administer the sacrament .
" The special grace of the sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick has as its effects : * the uniting of the sick person to the passion of Christ , for his own good and that of the whole Church ; * the strengthening , peace , and courage to endure in a Christian manner the sufferings of illness or old age ; * the forgiveness of sins , if the sick person was not able to obtain it through the sacrament of penance ; * the restoration of health , if it is conducive to the salvation of his soul ; * the preparation for passing over to eternal life . "
An extensive account of the teaching of the Catholic Church on Anointing of the Sick is given in Catechism of the Catholic Church , 1499â€“1532 .
BIBLICAL
REFERENCES Section::::Biblical references .
The chief Biblical text concerning anointing of the sick is : " Is any man sick among you ?
Let him bring in the priests of the church and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord .
And the prayer of faith shall save the sick man .
And the Lord shall raise him up : and if he be in sins , they shall be forgiven him .
" , and are also quoted in this regard .
NAMES FOR THE SACRAMENT Section::::Names for the sacrament .
In the past , the usual name of the sacrament in official documents of the Catholic Church was Extreme Unction ( meaning , Final Anointing ) , a name attached to it when it was administered only to those on the point of death .
Peter Lombard ( died 1160 ) is the first writer known to have used the term , which did not become the usual name in the West till towards the end of the twelfth century , and never became current in the East .
The word " extreme " ( final ) indicated either that it was the last of the sacramental unctions ( after the anointings at Baptism , Confirmation and , if received , Holy Orders ) or because at that time it was normally administered only when a patient was in extremis ( at the point of death ) .
In the early 1970s the official name was changed to Anointing of the Sick to reflect Church teaching that the sacrament is to be conferred on those who are " dangerously ill " .
" Extreme Unction " continues in popular use among those who prefer to keep the terminology that was customary in the period immediately before the Second Vatican Council ( see Traditionalist Catholic ) .
The sacrament has also been known by various other names in Western Christianity throughout the years , including : the holy oil or unction of the sick ; the unction or blessing of consecrated oil ; the unction of God ; the officeM of the unction .
In the Eastern Church it is technically known as euchelaion ( i.e. , prayer - oil ) ; other names used include :
elaion hagion ( holy oil ) , hegismenon elaion ( consecrated oil ) , elaiou chrisis ( anointing with oil ) , chrisma ( anointing ) .
ADMINISTRATION Section::::Administration .
Catholic canon law indicates who may receive the sacrament : " The anointing of the sick can be administered to a member of the faithful who , having reached the use of reason , begins to be in danger due to sickness or old age .
" If a new illness develops or the first illness relapses or worsens , the patient may receive the sacrament a further time .
A priest may , on the basis of his pastoral judgment , administer the sacrament numerous times in cases of old age or chronic illness .
Like any sacrament , anointing of the sick can be given only to someone who is alive ; however , as the precise moment of death is not known or defined with precision , someone may be anointed conditionally ( " if you are alive " prefixed to the sacramental formula ) during a brief period after being declared clinically dead .
The sacrament of anointing can be administered to an individual whether at home , in a hospital or institution , or in church .
Several sick persons may be anointed within the rite , especially if the celebration takes place in a church or hospital .
The celebration may also take place during a Catholic Mass. RELATIONSHIP WITH THE " LAST RITES " Section::::Relationship with the " last rites " .
When administered to those on the point of death , the sacraments of Penance , Anointing of the Sick and Viaticum ( Holy Communion administered to someone who is dying ) are sometimes mistakenly called the last rites .
What in the judgment of the Catholic Church are properly described as the last rites are Viaticum , and the ritual prayers of Commendation of the Dying , and Prayers for the Dead .
The normal order of administration of these three sacraments to the dying is : first Reconciliation ( if the dying person is physically unable to confess , absolution is given conditionally on the existence of contrition ) , then Anointing , then Viaticum .
Only a priest or bishop can administer the sacraments of Reconciliation and Anointing of the Sick , but a lay person may give a dying person Holy Communion as " Viaticum , the Last Sacrament of the Christian " .
ESTABLISHED FORM
Section::::Established form .
The oil used in the sacrament is usually olive oil , though other oils may also be used .
It is blessed by the bishop of the diocese at the Chrism Mass he celebrates on Holy Thursday or on a day close to it .
In case of necessity , the priest administering the sacrament may bless the oil within the framework of the celebration .
In the Roman Rite of the Latin Church , the priest anoints the sick person 's forehead and hands with oil ( usually in the form of a cross ) , saying : " Through this holy anointing , may the Lord in his love and mercy help you with the grace of the Holy Spirit .
May the Lord who frees you from sin save you and raise you up . "
He may also , in accordance with local culture and traditions , and the needs of the sick person , anoint other parts of the body , but without repeating the sacramental formula .
This is the form established for the Roman Rite through the papal document Sacram unctionem infirmorum of 1972 .
The form used in the Roman Rite in the preceding period included anointing of seven parts of the body ( though that of the loins was generally omitted in English - speaking countries ) , while saying ( in Latin ) : " Through this holy anointing , may the Lord pardon you whatever sins / faults you have committed by ... .
" The sense in question was then mentioned : sight , hearing , smell , taste , touch , walking , carnal delectation .
EASTERN CATHOLIC
CHURCHES Section::::Eastern Catholic churches .
In the Eastern Catholic churches , the sacrament ( or " sacred mystery " ) of Anointing the Sick is administered using various liturgies often identical with forms used by non - Catholic Eastern churches .
Adaptation or development of the liturgical forms used in the Eastern Catholic churches is overseen by the Congregation for the Oriental Churches , part of the Roman Curia .
