He confronts Katie with the information , causing a huge fight .
They break up , and Katie moves out of her house .
As Katie is about to leave town , however , Alex intercepts her and says that he has fallen in love with her .
Katie returns his love , and decides to stay in Southport .
She tells Alex that she fled to Southport to escape her abusive and alcoholic husband .
They got in a fight , and she stabbed him in self - defense before she fled south .
Meanwhile , Kevin is suspended for creating the wanted posters , whereupon it is revealed that he is Katie 's ( Erin 's ) abusive and alcoholic husband .
Enraged , he breaks into Katie 's former neighbor 's home back in Boston and finds the phone number to the Southport restaurant where Katie works .
Arriving just in time for the town 's Fourth of July parade , a severely intoxicated Kevin sees Katie kissing Alex , which enrages him .
That night , Katie has a dream that she is standing on the docks watching the fireworks when Jo comes up and tells Katie that " he " is here .
Katie wakes up in the convenience store next to a sleeping Lexie when Kevin suddenly appears and confronts her , demanding that she go back with him .
She refuses and tells him to leave .
Kevin pulls a gun and pours gasoline all over the store , with the intent to burn it down .
When he hesitates , Katie buys time by faking sympathy for him and agreeing to return home with him .
When he lets his guard down , she pushes him into the water ; however , a firework spark lands on the gasoline , igniting a fire that engulfs the store .
Alex sees the burning store , quickly makes his way across the harbor by boat , and saves Lexie .
Meanwhile , Katie tries to fight off Kevin ; during the struggle , the gun goes off and kills Kevin , ridding her of him forever .
In the aftermath of the fire , Alex recovers several letters which were written by his late wife Carly before she died .
The letters were prepared ahead of time for memorable events such as Josh 's eighteenth birthday and Lexie 's wedding day .
Alex gives Katie a letter with the words " To Her " on the envelope ; the letter thanks the recipient for making Alex happy .
Enclosed with the letter is a photo of Alex 's late wife , whom Katie is astonished to discover was actually Jo .
