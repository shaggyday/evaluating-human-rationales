SYNOPSIS
Section::::Synopsis .
Herzog used sequences extracted from more than 100 hours of video footage shot by Treadwell during the last five years of his life .
He also conducted and filmed interviews with Treadwell 's family and friends , and bear and nature experts .
Park rangers and bear experts commented on statements and actions by Treadwell , such as his repeated claims that he was defending the bears from poachers .
Park rangers noted that there had never been a recorded incident of poaching at this national park .
As another example , Treadwell claimed he had " gained the trust " of certain bears , sufficient to approach and pet them .
Park rangers pointed out that bears are wild and potentially dangerous animals ; given that , Treadwell was lucky to have survived as long as he had without being mauled .
One park ranger suggested that the bears were so confused by Treadwell 's direct , casual contact that they were n't sure how to react to him .
Other park rangers point out that the bears were not threatened by poachers , but Treadwell 's actions put them at real risk of harm and death .
By familiarizing them with human contact , he increased the likelihood that they would approach human habitation seeking food , and cause a confrontation in which humans would kill them .
In 2003 , Treadwell was camping in Katmai National Park with his girlfriend , Amie Huguenard .
Treadwell usually left the park at the end of summer but that year stayed into early October .
This put him and Huguenard at greater risk , as in this period , bears are aggressive about searching for food to store up calories for hibernation during the winter .
Herzog speculates that their staying later in the season ultimately resulted in the deaths of Treadwell and Huguenard .
In addition to presenting views from friends and professionals , Herzog narrates and offers his own interpretations of events .
He concluded that Treadwell had a sentimental view of nature , thinking he could tame the wild bears .
Herzog notes that nature is cold and harsh .
Treadwell 's view clouded his thinking and led him to underestimate danger , resulting in his death and that of Huguenard .
Treadwell 's video camera captured an audio record of the bear attack .
Herzog refrained from making this a part of the film , but he is shown listening to it , clearly disturbed .
The director advised Jewel Palovak ( the owner of the tape ) to destroy it rather than listen to it .
He later repudiated his own advice , saying it was Stupid ... silly advice born out of the immediate shock of hearing
â€” I mean , it 's the most terrifying thing I 've ever heard in my life .
Being shocked like that , I told her , ' You should never listen to it , and you should rather destroy it .
It should not be sitting on your shelf in your living room all the time . '
[ But ] she slept over it and decided to do something much wiser .
She did not destroy it but separated herself from the tape , and she put it in a bank vault .
The coroner gave Palovak Treadwell 's wristwatch , which had been retrieved from his left arm , one of the few remains found .
Willy Fulton , the pilot who discovered the remains of Treadwell and Huguenard , had noted seeing the lone arm with the wristwatch and not being able to keep the image out of his mind .
PRODUCTION Section::::Production .
Treadwell spent 13 summers in Katmai National Park and Preserve , Alaska .
Over time , he believed the bears grew to trust him ; they allowed him to approach them
and he had even touched them .
He gained some national notoriety for his work with the bears and founded Grizzly People with his friend Jewel Palovak .
They worked to protect bears in national parks by raising awareness .
Park officials repeatedly warned him that his interaction with the bears was unsafe to both him and to the bears .
" At best , he 's misguided , " Deb Liggett , superintendent at Katmai and Lake Clark national parks , told the Anchorage Daily News in 2001 .
" At worst , he 's dangerous .
If Timothy models unsafe behavior , that ultimately puts bears and other visitors at risk .
" Treadwell filmed his exploits , and used the films to raise public awareness of the problems faced by bears in North America .
In 2003 , at the end of his 13th visit , he and his girlfriend Amie Huguenard were attacked , killed , and partially eaten by a bear .
The events that led to the attack are unknown .
Jewel Palovak , co - founder of Grizzly People and a close friend of Treadwell 's , had to give her approval for the film to be produced , as she controlled his video archives .
The filmmakers had to deal with logistical as well as sentimental factors related to Treadwell 's footage of his bear interactions .
Grizzly
People is a " grassroots organization " concerned with the treatment of bears in the United States .
After her friend 's death , Palovak was left with control of Grizzly People and Treadwell 's 100 hours of archival footage .
As his close friend , former girlfriend , and confidante , she had a large emotional stake in the production .
She had known Treadwell since 1985 and felt a deep sense of responsibility to her late friend and his legacy .
She said that he had often discussed his video archives with her .
" Timothy was very dramatic , " she once said .
She quoted Treadwell as saying , " ' If I die , if something happens to me , make that movie .
You make it .
You show ' em . '
I thought that Werner Herzog could definitely do that . "

Letterman had joked that Treadwell would be eaten by a bear .

CRITICAL RECEPTION Section::::Critical reception .
Upon its North American theatrical release , Grizzly Man was acclaimed by critics .
On Rotten Tomatoes , the film has a 92 % " Certified Fresh " score based on 136 reviews , with an average rating of 8/10 .
The site 's consensus states : " Whatever opinion you come to have of the obsessive Treadwell , Herzog has once again found a fascinating subject .
" Metacritic reports an 87 out of 100 rating based on 35 critics , indicating " universal acclaim " .
David Denby of The New Yorker said : Narrating in his extraordinary German - accented English , Herzog is fair - minded and properly respectful of Treadwell 's manic self - invention .
He even praises Treadwell as a good filmmaker : as Treadwell stands talking in the foreground of the frame , the bears play behind him or scoop up salmon in sparkling water ; in other shots , a couple of foxes leap across the grass in the middle of a Treadwell monologue .
The footage is full of stunning incidental beauties .
Film critic Roger Ebert , a longtime supporter of Herzog 's work , awarded the film four out of four stars .
' I will protect these bears with my last breath ' , Treadwell says .
After he and Amie become the first and only people to be killed by bears in the park , the bear that is guilty is shot dead .
Treadwell 's watch , still ticking , is found on his severed arm .
I have a certain admiration for his courage , recklessness , idealism , whatever you want to call it , but here is a man who managed to get himself and his girlfriend eaten , and you know what ?
He deserves Werner Herzog .
Charlie Russell , a naturalist who studied bears for many years , lived near them and raised them for a decade in Kamchatka , corresponded with Treadwell and wrote about the film :
Herzog is a skillful filmmaker so a large percentage of those who watch the movie Grizzly Man , overlook Timothy 's amazing way with animals even though to me this stands out very strongly .
The fact that Timothy spent an incredible 35,000 hours , spanning 13 years , living with the bears in Katmai National Park , without any previous mishap , escapes people completely .
Even with his city - kid background , I found myself mesmerized by what he could do with animals .
The film placed at No . 94 on Slant Magazines best 100 films of the 2000s .
