LIST OF WORLD SERIES CHAMPIONS
The World Series is the annual championship series of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) and concludes the MLB postseason .
First played in 1903 , the World Series championship is determined through a best - of - seven playoff and is a contest between the champions of baseball 's National League ( NL ) and American League ( AL ) .
Often referred to as the " Fall Classic " , the modern World Series has been played every year since 1903 with two exceptions : in 1904 , when the NL champion New York Giants declined to play the AL champion Boston Americans ; and in 1994 , when the series was canceled due to the players ' strike .
The best - of - seven style has been the format of all World Series except in 1903 , 1919 , 1920 , and 1921 , when the winner was determined through a best - of - nine playoff .
Although the large majority of contests have been played entirely during the month of October , a small number of Series have also had games played during September and November .
The Series - winning team is awarded the Commissioner 's Trophy .
Players , coaches , and others associated with the team are generally given World Series rings to commemorate their victory ; however , they have received other items such as pocket watches and medallions in the past .
The winning team is traditionally invited to the White House to meet the President of the United States .
A total of 114 Series have been contested , with the NL champion winning 48 and the AL champion winning 66 .
The New York Yankees of the AL have played in 40 World Series through 2018—winning 27—the most Series appearances and most victories of any Major League Baseball franchise .
The Los Angeles Dodgers of the NL have the most losses with 14 .
The St. Louis Cardinals have represented the NL 19 times , and won 11 championships , second - most among all teams and most among NL clubs .
Both the Giants and the Los Angeles Dodgers have appeared in more World Series , with 20 each .
The Seattle Mariners and the Washington Nationals ( formerly Montreal Expos ) are the only current Major League Baseball franchises to have never appeared in a World Series ; the San Diego Padres , Colorado Rockies , Texas Rangers ( formerly the 1961–1971 version of the Washington Senators ) , Tampa Bay Rays , and Milwaukee Brewers ( formerly Seattle Pilots ) have all played in the Series but have never won .
The Toronto Blue Jays are the only franchise from outside the United States to appear in a World Series , winning in 1992 and 1993 .
The Houston Astros have represented both the NL ( 2005 ) and the AL ( 2017 ) , winning the Series in 2017 .
The current World Series champions are the Boston Red Sox .
