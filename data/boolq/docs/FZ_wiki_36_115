HISTORY FINALS Section::::History .
Section::::Finals .
As one of the 13 national sides that accepted the invitation to the inaugural World Cup , Peru was placed in Group 3 with Romania and hosts Uruguay .
With a mere 300 spectators , Peru 's match against Romania holds the record of lowest attendance in a World Cup game .
Peru lost ( 1–3 ) in a violent game where , in the second half , a fight broke out and
a Peruvian became the first player sent off in a World Cup .
A few days later , Peru and Uruguay played the inaugural match in the Estadio Centenario in Montevideo .
The Peruvians were lauded by the spectators for their defense and the impressive ability of forward José María Lavalle .
Peru lost ( 0 - 1 ) to the eventual champions , who defeated their subsequent opponents by scoring at least 4 goals per game .
The Peruvian squad next qualified for the Mexico 1970 World Cup , where they were placed in Group 4 with West Germany , Bulgaria , and Morocco .
Playing their first game two days after the 1970 Ancash earthquake , the team quickly conceded two goals to Bulgaria .
However , as Brian Glanville stated , " the elusive dribbling of Cubillas , the powerful breaks from the back four of Héctor Chumpitaz , the running of [ Hugo ] Sotil and [ Alberto ] Gallardo , turned the tide .
" Peru eventually won 3–2 .
After defeating Morocco ( 3–0 ) and losing to West Germany ( 1–3 ) , the team finished second in the group and advanced to the quarterfinals .
Facing Rivellino , Tostão , Jairzinho and Pelé , Peru was beaten by Brazil ( 2–4 ) in " a spectacular and effervescent game , a game in which both sides delighted in attack and scorned caution , " and where both teams displayed " a feast of open play and goals . "
In the Argentina 1978 World Cup , Peru was placed in Group 4 with Scotland , Iran , and the Netherlands .
With a midfield identified " as the best in the world " by Argentine sports magazine El Gráfico , Peru advanced to the second round as group leaders after defeating Scotland ( 3–1 ) , drawing with the Netherlands ( 0–0 ) , and beating Iran ( 4–1 ) .
The second round was divided into two groups , and Peru 's results placed it in Group B with Poland , Brazil , and Argentina .
After losing to Brazil ( 0–3 ) and Poland ( 0–1 ) , Peru was practically out of contention despite having one more game to play against Argentina .
This last match proved controversial because the Peruvians lost by a margin ( 0–6 ) that allowed Argentina to reach the final instead of Brazil .
Rumors circulated that the match had been fixed , but nothing was ever proven .
Peru participated in the Spain 1982 World Cup as part of Group 1 with Italy , Poland , and Cameroon .
Prior to the competition , Peru embarked on a practice tour that included victories against Hungary ( 1–2 ) in Budapest and France ( 0–1 ) in Paris , a tie with Algeria ( 1–1 ) in Algiers , and , upon returning home , a victory over Romania ( 2–0 ) .
In the World Cup finals , Peru 's opening match against Cameroon ended in a scoreless draw .
Against Italy , Peru " put on a mix of solid defending and spectacular attacking " that resulted in a draw ( 1–1 ) against the eventual champions .
Peru only needed another draw to advance in the tournament , and it managed to maintain a scoreless first half against Poland , but a " mixup in the midfield " and a " tired defense " during the second half led to Peru 's defeat ( 1–5 ) and early elimination .
QUALIFIERS Section::::Qualifiers .
Teams were invited to participate at the 1930 World Cup , so there was no qualifying tournaments .
Peru did not enter or withdrew from the qualifying rounds in 1934 , 1938 , 1950 and 1954 .
Peru failed to qualify in 1958 , 1962 and 1966 .
For the 1970 CONMEBOL qualifying tournament , Peru eliminated Bolivia and Argentina .
The game between Peru and Bolivia in La Paz is infamous for being fixed by Argentina in favor of Bolivia .
Match referee Sergio Chechelev annulled a valid goal from Peru without any justification , allowing Bolivia to win 2 - 1 .
Years later , Chechelev admitted that Argentina had paid him to favor Bolivia .
Against Argentina in Buenos Aires , the last game of the group , Peru managed a 2 - 2 draw , preventing Argentina 's intervention from succeeding in the end .
This is the only time Argentina has failed to advance in World Cup qualifying .
Peru was eliminated by Chile in 1974 .
In 1978 and 1982 , Peru finished at the top of their group and advanced to the finals .
Peru had two wins and two draws in both three - team groups , eliminating Chile and Ecuador in 1978 and Uruguay and Columbia in 1982 .
Peru almost qualified for Mexico 1986 .
Peru was placed in Group 1 with Argentina , Colombia and Venezuela .
Peru 's last two matches were against Argentina .
Peru beat Argentina 1 - 0 in Lima on 23 June 1985 .
In a rematch seven days later in Buenos Aires , Peru led 2 - 1 but Ricardo Gareca inspired his team to a 2 - 2 draw sending Argentina into the World Cup finals which they would win .
A win would have put Peru directly into the finals , however , they still had a chance to qualify through the CONMEBOL playoff .
Peru lost 2 - 5 aggregate to Chile in the first round .
Peru was grouped for the 1990 World Cup qualification along with Bolivia and Uruguay .
Peru lost all their games with only two goals scored , one by José del Solar and the other by Andres Gonzales .
Julio César Uribe was considered one of the best players of the team at that time .
The campaign to reach France 1998 was settled only on goal difference , as they finished even on points with Chile .
The qualifying system had changed and now all teams were to face each other , and Peru had been able to maintain the 4th spot until the next - to - last match when they faced Chile at Santiago .
Peru lost 4 - 0 .
The preliminaries for Korea / Japan 2002 were difficult , as the team finished eighth in the group with just four wins in eighteen matches .
The fact that they only managed to score 14 goals demonstrated how far the attack had fallen since the days of Cubillas .
Particularly low points of the qualifying tournament included a 3 - 0 loss at Venezuela and defeats in over half of their home matches to Uruguay , Ecuador , Argentina , Colombia and Brazil .
During the years of 2004 and 2005 , Peru participated in the qualifier for the Germany 2006 World Cup .
Peru this time hit the ground hard as conflicts with the team 's management soon showed poor results in the games that were to follow .
Paulo Autuori managed the squad , but was not able to achieve popularity due to a disastrous campaign that led Peru into 8th place just above Bolivia and Venezuela .
Freddy Ternero also momentarily managed the squad , but was dismissed due to problems with the FPF .
The South Africa 2010 qualifiers , beginning in 2007 , resulted in another set of problems for the Peruvian team .
In their first four games , the team only achieved two ties , both at home , and two losses .
Controversies between the FPF and the IPD ( Peruvian Sports Institute ) caused problems outside of the field for the national team .
Also a scandal shook the team as it was discovered , with informational support of prominent figures such as Jaime Bayly , that several of the players had been partying during the time they were supposedly " concentrating " for a match against Brazil .
Since then , Claudio Pizarro ( SV Werder Bremen ) , Jefferson Farfán ( Schalke 04 ) , Andrés Mendoza ( Diyarbakırspor ) and Santiago Acasiete ( UD Almería ) , important figures in the team , were never considered again for the national team by coach José del Solar .
The 2008 season resulted with 3 losses , including 6 - 0 loss against Uruguay , 2 draws against Argentina and Colombia , and only 1 game won against Venezuela .
In 2009 la blanquirroj could n't revert the situation , being the first team eliminated , at the 14th round .
They only won 2 matches during this year , against Uruguay and Bolivia .
Finally , after 36 years , the national team managed to make it to the 2018 World Cup in Russia .
They finished fifth in the qualifiers , following a controversial final day draw against Colombia , with Paolo Guerrero scoring the crucial goal .
They went on to face New Zealand in an inter - continental play off , winning 2 - 0 on aggregate , courtesy of goals from Farfán and Christian Ramos , to become the last team to qualify for Russia .
On 16 June 2018 they lost 0 - 1 against Denmark , with one goal scored by Yussuf Poulsen ; on 21 June they lost 1 - 0 against France , with a goal scored by Kylian Mbappe ; and on 26 June they defeated Australia 0 - 2 , with goals scored by André Carrillo and Paolo Guerrero .
It is the first time Peru had played these three nations at a World Cup , but were also the second team to having failed to progress the group stage , the first being Ecuador in 2014 .
