DANCING WITH THE STARS Dancing with the Stars is the name of several international television series based on the format of the British TV series
Strictly Come Dancing , which is distributed by BBC Worldwide , the commercial arm of the BBC .
Currently the format has been licensed to over 42 territories .
Versions have also been produced in dozens of countries across the world .
As a result , the series became the world 's most popular television program among all genres in 2006 and 2007 , according to the magazine Television Business International , reaching the Top 10 in 17 countries .
The show pairs a number of well known celebrities with professional ballroom dancers , who each week compete by performing one or more choreographed routines that follow the prearranged theme for that particular week .
The dancers are then scored by a panel of judges .
Viewers are given a certain amount of time to place votes for their favorite dancers , either by telephone or ( in some countries ) online .
The couple with the lowest combined score provided by the judges and viewers is eliminated .
This process continues until there are only two or three couples left ; when they have competed for the last time one couple is declared the champion and wins a trophy .

Đông Nhi Lương Mạnh Hải CHINA ( INCLUDING HONG KONG ) Section::::China ( including Hong Kong ) .
The Chinese version is a co - production between mainland China 's HBS and Hong Kong 's TVB , under licence from the BBC .
In mainland China it is aired on Hunan Television and in Hong Kong on TVB Jade .
The Chinese title ( ) is difficult to translate , but could be rendered as Miracle Dancing or " Miracles of Dance Moves " .
The official English title is Strictly Come Dancing .
Each broadcaster provides five male and five female dancers , for a total of twenty .
Pairs were determined by audience SMS votes .
The programme began airing in late 2007 , in order to mark the anniversary of the 1997 handover of Hong Kong from the UK to the People 's Republic of China .
INDIA Section::::India .
The Indian version is called Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa .
It was first broadcast in September 2006 on Sony Entertainment Television ( SET ) .
A lot of people confuse Dancing With The Stars with Nach Baliye which airs on StarPlus .
Nach Baliye and Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa have similar content and presentation but there are minor differences in the concept .
The celebrity dancers on Nach Baliye are real life couples , and work with an assigned choreographer .
The dancers on Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa have one celebrity paired with a trained dancer / choreographer .
A notice at the end of the show verifies that the Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa is indeed a version of Dancing With The Stars .
