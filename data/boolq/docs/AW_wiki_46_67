PREMISE Section::::Premise .
The series is about a boy named Malcolm ( Frankie Muniz ) , the third - born child in a comically dysfunctional working - class family of four , and later , five boys , the sons of Lois ( Jane Kaczmarek ) and Hal ( Bryan Cranston ) .
As of the first season , their delinquent oldest child , Francis ( Christopher Masterson ) , has been sent away to military school , while younger brothers Reese ( Justin Berfield ) , Malcolm , and Dewey ( Erik Per Sullivan ) remain at home with their parents .
With Francis away , Malcolm becomes the middle child of the family .
In season four , the character Jamie ( James and Lukas Rodriguez ) was added to the show as the fifth son of Hal and Lois .
The show 's early seasons centered on Malcolm dealing with the rigors of being an intellectual adolescent and enduring the eccentricities of his family life .
Later seasons expanded the show 's scope by exploring the family 's interactions with their extended family , friends and colleagues in more depth , including Lois ' tyrannical mother ( Cloris Leachman ) ; Craig Feldspar , Lois ' coworker at the Lucky Aide drugstore ; Malcolm 's disabled friend Stevie Kenarban , and Stevie 's dad Abe ; as well as a series of continuing subplots detailing Francis ' misadventures at the military college , from which he subsequently runs away to work in an Alaskan logging camp , before finally landing a job on a dude ranch run by an eccentric German couple .
The series differed significantly from the standard TV sitcom format / presentation in many respects .
Malcolm routinely broke the fourth wall by both narrating in voice - over and talking directly to the viewer on camera .
The distinctive look and sound of the series relied heavily on elaborate post - production , including fast - cut editing , sound effects and musical inserts , the extensive use of locations , and unusual camera styles , compositions and effects (
e.g. overhead , tracking , hand - held and crane shots , and the frequent use of a wide - angle lens for both closeups and ensemble scenes ) that would be generally impractical or impossible to achieve in a standard studio - based video multi - camera sitcom production .
All scenes were shot using a single - camera setup , and the show employed neither a laugh track nor a live studio audience .
Emulating the style of hour - long dramas , this half - hour show was shot on film instead of on video .
Another distinctive aspect of the show is that the cold open of every episode is unrelated to the main story .
Exceptions were episodes which were the conclusions of " two - parters " ; each part two episode opened with a recap of its part one episode .
The family 's surname was never mentioned directly on the series .
Linwood Boomer 's script for the pilot episode originally included the surname Wilkerson , but it was later removed because he did not want to put " any specific ethnic label on the characters " .
The surname appeared in early drafts of promotional material and also on Francis ' uniform in the pilot .
In the last episode of the series , Francis drops his ID badge from work , which lists his name as " Francis Nolastname " .
Also in the last episode , the principal announces Malcolm as the speaker , clearly mouthing " Nolastname " as his voice is drowned out by microphone feedback .
A publicist for Fox said that " officially the family 's last name should be considered a mystery " .
CHARACTERS MAIN * Lois ( Jane Kaczmarek ) : The family 's wildly hotheaded and stubborn mother .
An intelligent and decisive woman , most of her bullishness comes from her constant battles throughout the series to keep her badly behaved , highly destructive boys in check , while maintaining a menial job at a Lucky Aide drugstore .
Despite her constant aggressiveness , she is motherly and will defend her family fiercely , especially towards neighbors and others who view them as poor trash ; in one episode , she finds that Malcolm and Reese discovered their neighbor having an affair with her Hispanic gardener while they planned to frame her son for theft , but does n't punish them for their actions as this counted as revenge against the woman , who hated Lois .
Lois is disliked by both Hal 's wealthy family and her own parents .
She has a younger sister named Susan , who blames Lois for stealing Hal from her .
Neighbors despise Lois and her boys and celebrate the weekends when they 're gone .
In the series finale , she discovered that she and Hal are expecting a sixth child .
* Hal ( Bryan Cranston ) : Hal is Lois ' husband and father to Francis , Reese , Malcolm , Dewey , and Jamie .
Hal is a well - meaning , loving , but inept and somewhat immature father , and is completely dependent on Lois , whom he loves absolutely .
He comes from a wealthy family that does not accept Lois as his wife and wishes that he married Susan instead .
Because his family is disrespectful towards Lois , he rarely mentions them and avoids his family .
Hal loves his boys and will sometimes sneak them out for fun father - son activities behind Lois ' back .
Hal is an indecisive character who frequently picks up new hobbies for short periods of time , such as speed walking , or painting , and is irresponsible with the money he earns from his low - paying desk job .
His indecisiveness was explored in " Living Will " from a childhood which he had a hard time making decisions for himself and because of this , he always deferred to Lois to make them for him .
In the series finale , he discovered that he and Lois are expecting a sixth child .
Hal has a high sex drive , this was revealed in the episode " Forbidden Girlfriend " when Lois is taking medication and is unable to have sex for an entire week , it is mentioned again in the episode
" Poker 2 "
when Hal tells his friends he has sex 14 times per week .
Hal 's best friend is Abe Kenarban .
* Francis ( Christopher Masterson ) : Hal and Lois ' first son .
At the beginning of the series , he is attending military school in Alabama , run by the strict Commandant Spangler ( Daniel von Bargen ) .
It is shown that his parents enjoyed a promising middle - class , comfortable lifestyle before he was born and that he was such a difficult , destructive child that that dream soon ended .
He has himself legally emancipated at the start of Season 3 , leaves the school , and travels to Alaska .
He finds work at a logging camp and later meets and marries Piama ( Emy Coligado ) , a girl of Inuit heritage .
When the camp closes , they move to the western United States and take jobs at a Wild West - themed hotel / ranch , run by kindly but eccentric German , Otto Mannkusser ( Kenneth Mars ) , and his wife , Gretchen ( Meagen Fay ) .
Francis and his mother have a mutual love - hate war of wills and his main motivation in life is to thwart or irk her ( though , ironically , he marries a woman with the same personality as Lois . )
Although a juvenile delinquent , he is street - smart .
Francis is seen less frequently after season 5 , becoming an occasional recurring character and making only a small handful of appearances in Season 6 and the final Season 7 .
Whereas he was featured regularly in previous seasons as a side - story to the main family , Francis ' steady job disappeared in season 6 due to legal issues , and he returned to being a delinquent , leading a questionable and poor lifestyle with his wife , Piama , until it is revealed in the final episode of season 7 , " Graduation " , that Francis already has a steady desk job sorting out computers .
He admits he likes his job to Hal , but also enjoys frustrating Lois by telling her that he 's unemployed .
* Reese ( Justin Berfield ) : Hal and Lois ' second son .
He is the older brother of Malcolm , Dewey , and Jamie , and younger brother of Francis .
Reese is the most impulsive and physical of the boys .
He lacks common sense , he is frequently outwitted and outspoken by other family members , and is gleefully violent .
Despite being unwilling to think , Reese is as much a genius as his brothers , although in less traditional or obvious ways .
Reese is better than Malcolm at devising plans , and is masterful at the rare things which can pin his drifting focus , such as driving , or when he 's revealed to be a culinary prodigy , excelling at cooking and baking .
In the series finale , he finally graduates from high school after intentionally failing many times before , he obtained full employment as a high school custodian , and shares an apartment with Craig .
* Dewey ( Erik Per Sullivan ) : Hal and Lois ' fourth son .
He is the youngest child until the birth of Jamie , and often falls victim to his brothers ' pranks .
Dewey is very intelligent and musically gifted .
He plays the piano .
He has a very high tolerance for pain due to years of physical and mental abuse from his brothers .
Despite his intelligence , he is placed in a remedial class for slower students ( or " Buseys " ) due to a misunderstanding .
Dewey remains in the class and serves as their self - appointed teacher .
By the seventh and final season of the show , the Busey class is no longer mentioned .
He is the only sibling that eventually breaks the cycle of abusing the younger sibling , which ends up with him acting like a normal , lovable brother towards Jamie .
In the series finale , he and Jamie are seen hiding in the closet together after a prank .
* Catherine Lloyd Burns as Caroline Miller ( seasons 1 - 2 ) :
Malcolm 's " overly earnest " teacher .
She ardently adores Malcolm due to his intelligence .
Francis uses her adoration to pay a medical bill to stitch up Malcolm in one episode .
She is the teacher of the Krelboynes in Seasons 1 and 2 , at which time she is seen heavily pregnant .
After she gives birth , Caroline leaves teaching .
She was also the only non - family member to be credited as part of the main cast in the intro .
* Malcolm ( Frankie Muniz ) : the title character of the series .
Malcolm is a genius with an IQ of 165 and a photographic memory .
He is placed in a class for gifted students ( or " Krelboynes " as they are known at the school ) .
His intelligence , as well as feelings of not fitting in , and a large ego fueled by a cruel streak of snarkiness cause numerous problems for him over the course of the series .
As the title suggests , Malcolm is initially the middle child of the three living at home ; chronologically , he is Hal and Lois ' third son .
His best friend is Stevie Kenarban .
In the series finale , he graduates from high school and starts attending a prestigious college by both scholarship and working various jobs , specifically as a janitor at Harvard University .
* Jamie ( James and Lukas Rodriguez ) ( season 4 recurring ; seasons 5 - 7 ) : Hal and Lois ' fifth son , born at the end of Season 4 .

FILMING

Much of the filming for Malcolm in the Middle was done on location in various parts of the Thirty Mile Zone around Los Angeles .
A privately owned home , located at 12334 Cantura Street in Toluca Lake , California , was rented for upwards of $ 3,000 a day to film as Malcolm 's house .
Rebuilt in 2011 , the property is no longer recognizable due to its modern two - floor design .
However , the house directly to the left of it is nearly identical to what it looked like during filming , still making it a frequent stop for fans of the show .
School scenes were filmed at Walter Reed Middle School , in North Hollywood , and the Lucky Aide was represented by a Drug Emporium at 6020 Lankershim Boulevard in North Hollywood .
In " Stock Car Races , " when Hal and the boys are entering a race track , the billboard behind the entrance displays the place as Irwindale Speedway , a real race track in Southern California .
The last episode in the first season ( " Waterpark " ) was filmed at a water park called Wild Rivers ( now closed ) located in Irvine , California .
Though palm trees and desert scenery are seen in shots of the local region and town throughout the show , indicating a location in the Western United States , it is never revealed which state the show is set in ( except for Francis ' whereabouts in early seasons , such as his military school in Alabama and his job in Alaska ) .
Studio filming for Malcolm in the Middle took place on Stage 21 at CBS Studio Center in Studio City .
Hallmarks of the series ' filming and structure included the following : * A cold open presenting one or more family members in an absurd situation that has little or nothing to do with the main plot of the episode .
* A split - second whip pan as a transition from one scene to another .
* Frequent pieces to camera delivered by Malcolm .
* An abrupt cut to black at the end of each segment , accompanied by the sound of a slamming door .
During the final two seasons , Christopher Masterson reduced his on - screen time in favor of writing and directing some episodes .
