PAR ( GOLF SCORING FORMAT )
Par is a scoring system used mostly in amateur and club golf .
It involves scoring ( + , 0 , − ) based on results at each hole .
The objective is to have an end score with more pluses than minuses .
The result on each hole is always based on one 's handicap - adjusted score .
For ease of explanation , assume a player 's handicap gives him / her one stroke per hole ( i.e. , 9-hole handicap of 9 ) .
This player , playing to his / her handicap on a given day , will average a bogey on each hole .
Playing ' to ' ones handicap is expected and so there is no reward or punishment due when a bogey 5 is recorded on a par 4 .
Thus , a 0 ( zero ) is recorded .
A double - bogey 6
( one over what 's expected from a player on a 9 handicap , would incur a penalty of a minus ' − ' .
A 4 ( a genuine , unadjusted par ) is one better than a ' 9-handicapper ' would be expected to score and would earn a plus ' + ' .
However , for this golfer , 6s and above still incur just one minus ' − ' .
Likewise , 4s and below earn just one plus ' + ' .
At the end of the round , plusses and minuses are reconciled ( a minus cancels out a plus ) .
If a player finishes with two plusses , s / he is ' two up ' or ' plus 2 ' ( +2 ) .
The opposite applies if s / he finishes with two minuses - ' two down ' ; ' minus 2 ' ; ' −2 ' .
The Par format 's main disadvantage is that there is no reward for a handicap - adjusted eagle ( or even better ) .
Par 's main advantage is improving pace of play in large club competitions .
