CAMEROON NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM
The Cameroon national football team , nicknamed in French Les Lions Indomptables ( The Indomitable Lions or Untameable Lions ) , is the national team of Cameroon .
It is controlled by the Fédération Camerounaise de Football and has qualified seven times for the FIFA World Cup , more than any other African team ( in 1982 , 1990 , 1994 , 1998 , 2002 , 2010 and 2014 ) , and they were the only African team to appear at both the 1990 and 1994 tournaments .
However , the team has only made it once out of the group stage .
They were the first African team to reach the quarter - final of the World Cup , in 1990 , losing to England in extra time .
They have also won five Africa Cup of Nations titles .

2010
WORLD CUP QUALIFICATION Section::::2010 World Cup qualification .
In Cameroon 's 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign , the team was grouped with Gabon , Togo and Morocco .
After a slow start in their campaign with a loss to Togo , the coach of Cameroon , Otto Pfister , resigned .
Frenchman Paul Le Guen was appointed as the new coach after a draw against Morocco .
Le Guen 's appointment caused an uprise in Cameroon 's spirits as they earned a win against Gabon in Libreville , followed by another win against the Panthers four days later in Yaoundé .
One month later , they defeated Togo in Yaoundé by three goals .
On 14 November 2009 , Cameroon defeated the Atlas Lions of Morocco 2–0 in Fez in their last match of their campaign .
Gabon was also defeated by Togo 1–0 in Lomé .
Both results caused Cameroon to qualify for the 2010 World Cup finals , held in South Africa .
The Indomitable Lions were the first team to be mathematically eliminated in the 2010 World Cup , going out in their second group match to Denmark after losing 1–2 , preceded by a 0–1 defeat to Japan .
CONTROVERSY ABOUT SLEEVELESS AND ONE - PIECE KITS Section::::Controversy about sleeveless and one - piece kits .
Cameroon used sleeveless Puma shirts at the 2002 African Cup of Nations in Mali .
FIFA , however , did not allow Cameroon to use the same kits as at the 2002 World Cup , and black sleeves were added to the shirts .
The 2004 African Cup of Nations witnessed Cameroon again run into controversy regarding their kits .
Puma had designed a one - piece kit for the Cameroon team which FIFA declared illegal , stating that the kits must have separate shirts and shorts .
FIFA then imposed fines on Cameroon and deducted six points from their qualifying campaign .
Puma argued that a two - piece kit is not stated as a requirement in the FIFA laws of the game .
Puma , however , lost the case in court , and Cameroon were forced to wear two - piece kits , but FIFA subsequently restored the six qualifying points to Cameroon .
2003 CONFEDERATIONS CUP QUALIFIERS Section::::2003 Confederations Cup Qualifiers .
Cameroon started the 2002 African Cup of Nations competition with a 1–0 win over DR Congo .
That was followed by another 1–0 win against Ivory Coast , and a comfortable 3–0 win against Togo .
These results led Cameroon to qualify from the group stage to the quarter - finals as their group 's winner .
In the Knockout stage , Cameroon met Egypt in a close match that they won 1–0 by M'Boma 's goal in the 62nd minute of the game .
In the Semi - finals , Cameroon met the hosts Mali and won the match 3–0 to qualify to the final .

2017
CONFEDERATIONS CUP QUALIFIERS Section::::2017 Confederations Cup Qualifiers .
Cameroon started the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations competition with a 1–1 draw to Burkina Faso .
That was followed by a 2–1 win against Guinea - Bissau , and an unconvincing goalless draw against the hosts Gabon .
These results were enough for Cameroon to qualify from the group stage to the quarter - finals , where they met Senegal in a close match that Cameroon won 5–4 in a penalty shootout after it had ended 0–0 after extra time .
In the Semi - finals , Cameroon met Ghana and won the match 2–0 to qualify to the final .
On 5 February 2017 , and after a close match , Cameroon won the African Cup of Nations for the fifth time after defeating seven - time champions Egypt 2–1 in the final , by Vincent Aboubakar 's late goal in the 89th minute of the match .
