PUBLICATION HISTORY Section::::Publication history .
Created by editor Julius Schwartz , writer Dennis O'Neil and artist Neal Adams , he was introduced in Batman # 232 's " Daughter of the Demon " ( June 1971 ) .
The character 's creation and depiction was inspired by other works of fiction , such as the 1969 James Bond film On Her Majesty 's Secret Service , and the Fu Manchu fiction .
The Bond film has international crime lord Draco wanting the agent to marry his daughter Contessa Teresa .

CHARACTER OVERVIEW Section::::Character overview .
Ra 's al Ghul is an international criminal and terrorist mastermind whose ultimate goal is a world in perfect environmental balance .
He believes that the best way to achieve this balance is to eliminate most of humanity .
Ra 's usually tries to assault the world 's human populace with a biological weapon , such as a genetically - engineered virus .
He is aided in this quest by the Lazarus Pits , reservoirs of rejuvenating chemicals that restore the dead and dying to life ; these pits have granted him a lifespan of several centuries .
He regards Batman as his worthiest opponent , addressing him as " Detective " out of respect for his intellectual brilliance , and has frequently sought to make the Dark Knight as his successor .
He is one of the few criminals in Batman 's rogues gallery to have deduced his secret identity as Bruce Wayne , but keeps silent on the matter due to the same sense of respect for Batman .
For his own part , Batman 's opposition to Ra 's is complicated by both his own respect for al Ghul 's genius ( if not his goals and methods ) and his attraction to his daughter , Talia , which she reciprocates .
FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY
ORIGIN Section::::Fictional character biography .
Section::::Origin .
Ra 's al - Ghul 's real name , early life , and exact age have been described differently by various writers .
His Post - Crisis origin story is told in the graphic novel Batman : Birth of the Demon ( 1992 ) by Dennis O'Neil and Norm Breyfogle .
As told in Birth of the Demon , Ra 's al Ghul was born over 600 years before his first appearance in Batman comics , to a Bedouin tribe of nomads in a desert somewhere in the Arabian Peninsula , near a city whose inhabitants ' ancestors had journeyed there from Morocco .
Developing an interest in the sciences at an early age , Ra 's abandoned his tribe to live in the city , where he pursued life as a researcher .
He subsequently became a physician and married a woman named Sora .
Ra 's discovered the secret of the Lazarus Pit , and he saves a dying prince by lowering him into it .
The prince , who is sadistic to begin with , is driven completely insane by the Lazarus Pit .
He proceeds to strangle Sora , on whom he has already had his eye for some time .
The sultan , unwilling to admit to himself his son 's culpability , declares Ra 's guilty of the crime and sentences him to a slow , tortured death in a cage with Sora 's corpse .
Ra 's is set free by the son of a dying elderly woman , who Ra 's had earlier examined .
The son feels that he owes Ra 's a debt for easing his mother 's suffering during her last few hours .
Ra 's and the son head into the desert to seek the tribe of Ra 's ' birth .
Ra 's convinces the head of his tribe , his uncle , to follow Ra 's in his quest for revenge by promising the downfall of the sultan .
By understanding the germ theory of disease hundreds of years before anyone else , Ra 's is able to infect the prince with a deadly virus by sending him contaminated fabrics .
When the sultan comes to ask Ra 's to cure the prince again , Ra 's kills both him and his son .
Ra 's then leads his tribe to raze the city to the ground and kill all of its inhabitants .
Subsequently , Ra 's declares himself " Ra 's al Ghul " , the " Demon 's Head " .
Batman :
Birth of the Demon provides a rough figure of 500 years for Ra 's al Ghul 's age .
Due to living so long , he is assumed to have lost track of how old he is .
Azrael # 6 ( July 1995 ; written by Dennis O'Neil ) places Ra 's age closer to 450 years .
As he tells Jean Paul Valley , " I appear to be a vigorous fifty .
I am actually a very vigorous four hundred and forty - eight ... or is it four hundred and fifty - three ?
I lost count during the Black Plague .
No matter " .
In Batman Annual # 25 ( published in 2006 ) , Ra 's al Ghul is described as a " 700-Year Old International Terrorist " .
Using the Lazarus Pits to extend his life , Ra 's spends the next several centuries journeying the world .
He fights in the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars and becomes a formidable warrior .
As the world entered the modern age and industrialisation began to cover much of the Earth , Ra 's grew to despise the humans who he believed were destroying the world 's natural beauty , thus setting him on a path of eco - terrorism .
Also during this time , Ra 's , his uncle , and the boy who freed him from the sultan are all using the Lazarus Pits to prolong their lives until an incident in London .
Ra 's catches the boy writing his own memoirs in their original language , of which Ra 's has forbidden all records .
During a battle , Ra 's kills the boy and flees to a Lazarus Pit , which he uses .
When he returns to their home in London , his uncle has vanished with the remnants of their historical records .
Over time , he becomes a master of many forms of combat , notably fencing .
He also builds up vast wealth and creates The Demon , a huge international organization .
According to Justice League of America ( 1st series )
# 94 :
The League of Assassins , one of the many smaller organizations making up The Demon , is thus sometimes called " The Demon 's Fang " or " Demonfang " .
CONTAGION AND LEGACY Section::::Contagion and Legacy .
Ra 's returns to prominence and comes dangerously close to realizing his dream of worldwide genocide in the story arc of the Batman titles .
His organization unleashes a deadly virus known as Ebola Gulf A ( a.k.a .
" The Clench " ) in Gotham City , putting Batman in conflict with a force he seemingly can not defeat .
A cure is eventually located by Batman and his allies , though the mastermind behind the outbreak is not discovered until the follow - up story .
Learning that the Demon 's Head still lives , Batman and his team circle the globe , preventing further outbreaks of the virus .
Ra 's allies himself with Bane , the man who once crippled and nearly killed Batman .
Ra 's considers Bane a potential heir to his empire , despite his daughter Talia 's distaste for the criminal mastermind .
Eventually , Batman deduces a way to eliminate the Clench virus from an ancient " Wheel of Plagues " artifact whose knowledge has aided Ra 's in the creation of the disease .
The long - lived madman eludes justice again .
JLA :
TOWER OF BABEL
Section::::JLA : Tower of Babel .
In the " " storyline , in JLA # 43â€“46 , Ra 's discovers Batman 's contingency plans for stopping the other members of the Justice League of America , should they turn or be turned evil , and uses them to try to destroy the group .
Meanwhile , Ra 's steals the bodies of Batman 's parents .
This theft prevents Batman from realizing Ra 's is using his traps until it is too late , as he is distracted by the search for the corpses of his parents .
Though defeated , Ra 's does cause the temporary exit of Batman from the JLA , who now distrust the Caped Crusader .
However , though some of the League resent Batman 's plans , they eventually accept that the plans were created for the right reasons once Batman confirms that he trusts them by revealing his secret identity to the rest of the team .
Talia , disillusioned with her father , leaves the League to run LexCorp for former U.S. President Lex Luthor , before selling the company to Bruce Wayne for his Wayne Foundation to aid Batman and Superman 's victory over Luthor .
Ra 's blames Batman for his failed relationship with Talia , and stages a plot where he tries to separate Batman from his heir , Dick Grayson , shortly before Wayne officially adopts his former ward as his son .
The plan fails , and Wayne and Grayson go ahead with the adoption .
Ra 's is also featured in Birds of Prey # 31â€“35 , where he has a romantic fling with the Black Canary .
The superheroine is injured and healed in the Lazarus Pit , which also restores the Canary Cry she lost years earlier .
DEATH AND THE MAIDENS Section::::Death and the Maidens .
In Death and the Maidens ( 2004 ) , Ra 's ' other daughter , Nyssa Raatko , furious at her father for abandoning her in a Nazi concentration camp during World War II , begins plotting to destroy him , prompting Ra 's to contact Batman to make a deal for access to a Lazarus Pit to give him the strength for a final confrontation with Nyssa ; in exchange for the location of a Pit , Ra 's provides Batman with a serum that will allow him to walk in the spirit world and speak with his parents .
While Batman experiences his " vision " , Nyssa befriends Talia and then kidnaps and brainwashes her .
Nyssa plots to destroy all hope and optimism in the world by assassinating Superman with Kryptonite bullets she steals from the Batcave .
While Batman stops Nyssa from killing Superman , he is unable to stop her from mortally injuring her father .
A dying Ra 's reveals that this is all part of his greater plan to ensure that his daughters will realize that he is correct in his perceptions about the world and what needs to be done to it , and that they would come to accept their destinies as his heirs .
Ra 's ' plan works :
both Nyssa and Talia become the heads of The Demon and the League of Assassins .
Talia disavows her love for Bruce Wayne , and both sisters declare Batman their enemy .
It is too late for Ra 's , as Nyssa stabs her father through the heart , seemingly killing him for good .
To ensure Ra 's will not return , Batman oversees his nemesis ' cremation .
THE RESURRECTION OF RA 'S AL GHUL Section::::The Resurrection of Ra 's al Ghul .
In Batman Annual # 26 , Talia is prompted to read the history of Ra 's al Ghul to her son Damian by a mysterious figure from Ra 's ' past : the White Ghost .
Unbeknownst to her , the White Ghost plans to use Damian as a vessel for Ra 's ' return .
However , mother and son escape before the plan is completed .
After the escape , Batman confronts the White Ghost ; he fights Batman , but accidentally falls into a Lazarus Pit .
As of Batman # 670 , Ra 's al Ghul has returned , having evaded death by transferring his consciousness into the body of another .
Because his host body is decaying from radiation poisoning , he needs to transfer his mind into another host body .
His first choice is that of his grandson Damian Wayne , but Damian escapes to alert his father .
Upon taking Ra 's to a " Fountain of Essence " , which contains the qualities of a Lazarus Pit , Batman is confronted with the sight of the Sensei , who is revealed to be Ra 's ' father .
After defeating Ra 's , Sensei fights and impales Batman with a cane .
Determined to win , Batman drags the Sensei into the Fountain , where he is killed for not being a pure soul .
Ra 's , meanwhile , has taken over the body of a Nanda Parbat monk and departs .
Healed by the Fountain , Batman emerges and yells for Ra 's .
Ra 's attempts to make amends with Batman after his resurrection , but Batman responds by crushing his decaying fingers .
Ra 's accepts this latest rebuke and , with the help of his men , overpowers Batman and captures Damian , who has arrived to try to help his father .
Ra 's attempts to take over Damian , but Batman breaks free just as Robin , Talia , Alfred Pennyworth , and Nightwing arrive to save him .
While the battle ensues at Nanda Parbat , the White Ghost takes Ra 's to a secluded place , where he appears to accept the fact that his death is inevitable .
The White Ghost is revealed as Ra 's ' estranged albino son Dusan , and offers up his own body instead .
Ra 's performs the transfer of souls , but the White Ghost apparently dies soon afterward .
Ra 's resumes the battle and attempts to kill Batman , but the monks at Nanda Parbat stop him and banish him from the temple .
Following his resurrection , Ra 's al Ghul , in his new body , moves his base of operations to Gotham City where it is revealed that a remnant of his son Dusan 's consciousness still remains within him .
Since the White Ghost was his son , Ra 's was able to use the resemblance between them to modify his new body 's appearance to be more like his own .
This arrogance contributes to the brazen move to Gotham and a subsequent ninja attack on Batman , which indirectly leads to the discovery of a map of all the known Lazarus Pit locations across the globe .
Batman then infiltrates Ra 's al Ghul 's new Gotham penthouse headquarters and easily defeats his horde of ninjas and Ra 's himself .
To ensure Ra 's is not a constant threat within Gotham City , Batman comes up with the false identity of " Terry Gene Kase " , and plants it along with credible photos , medical records , and police records for both Blackgate Penitentiary and Arkham Asylum .
Batman takes an unconscious Ra 's directly to Arkham where it is believed he really is the prisoner " Terry Gene Kase " , a criminal with multiple personality disorder who has just been transferred to Arkham to finish out multiple life sentences .
Along with attaching false information and a false identity to Ra 's al Ghul 's file , Batman attaches a false prescription of potent medication that ensures slurred speech and next to zero mobility .
Despite these precautions , Ra 's eventually escapes when the orderlies miss his dosage once , which allows him to become conscious enough to escape from Arkham .
THE RETURN OF BRUCE WAYNE Section::::The Return of Bruce Wayne .
Ra 's realizes that Batman has apparently died after Darkseid 's invasion during Final Crisis .
After confronting Nightwing with his knowledge , he and the hero eventually duel with swords .
Nightwing defeats Ra 's and earns the immortal 's respect , signified by leaving his sword in the Batcave as a gift after their fight .
Ra 's refuses to believe his enemy 's passing despite the evidence , leading him to be involved in the Red Robin 's ( Tim Drake ) quest concerning the fate of the original Dark Knight .
After Drake finds proof that Wayne is still alive but lost in time after his battle with Darkseid , the former Boy Wonder cripples Ra 's ' organization , the League of Assassins , from within .
In response , Ra 's returns to Gotham to begin his attack to destroy every legacy of the Wayne Family .
While his men target everyone close to the Waynes , Ra 's makes a pact with Hush as part of his plans .
Unknown to both men , Lucius Fox has already given Tim power of attorney leaving him in control of the Wayne Family resources .
Enraged , Ra 's then engages Tim Drake in combat , which ends with Tim mocking Ra 's by saying that there 's nothing he can do to harm the Bat Family anymore ; in response , Ra 's smiles and says " Well done .
Detective " ( a name he has only ever reserved for Batman , Nightwing and Red Hood once before ) .
He then proceeds to kick him out of a skyscraper window and retreats from the battle .
Later , in seclusion , Ra 's reveals everything which happened was a test for Tim Drake , from the League , the Council , the Men of Death , and the plot against Bruce Wayne .
Learning of Bruce Wayne 's return , Ra 's muses that his next confrontation with the detective will be particularly interesting as he believes that Batman has at last had a taste of the immortality that Ra 's himself enjoys .
He goes after Vicki Vale and almost kills her .
He spares her life only after she refuses to publish the identity of Batman and gets rid of all of the evidence she has to that effect .
He also realizes that Vale may be a descendant of a French opponent , Marcel du Valliere , from centuries before ; therefore , his business with her may not be finished .
THE NEW 52 Section::::The New 52 .
In The New 52 ( a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe ) , Ra 's al Ghul appears in a hooded robe at the League of Assassins ' city of ' Eth Alth'eban .
He enters the Well of Sins after an encounter with Jason Todd .
When he emerges , Ra 's is consumed by the evil that corrupted the Untitled centuries before , and he feels compelled to rid himself of the machinations of his daughter and Ducra by killing Jason .
At Ra 's ' command , the prisoners are brought to him , and he promises to use his newfound power to destroy them .
Red Hood engages Ra 's , as Essence joins the battle .
She insists that he will allow Jason and his friends to leave his realm , or he will be forced to die a mortal death just as he always feared he would .
Despite having destroyed the All - Caste , Ra 's al Ghul 's actions have led to their eventual rebirth .
Defeated , he swears that he will visit great agony upon Red Hood if he ever sees him again .
Batman and Aquaman head to an island , where the League of Assassins are located , after Ra 's has the bodies of Damian Wayne and Talia exhumed .
Ra 's had ordered the hunt of whales , creating genetically altered super - humans in the wombs of sperm whales , part of a plan to rebuild the League of Assassins .
Inside the compound , they find that Ra 's is wiping the hard drives clean , preventing data recovery .
As his parting gift , he has left Batman the Heretics to keep him entertained .
Batman fights his way to Ra 's escape aircraft .
He sees Talia and Damian 's bodies stored within it , and clings to the fuselage from outside as the plane takes off .
Though Ra 's plans to go to Paradise Island , he is nearly surprised to see Batman pounding on the cockpit 's windshield .
From outside , Batman screams for Ra 's to give back his son , but Ra 's responds that he is blood of Damian 's blood and the boy is in good hands .
He orders the plane to tilt its angle , causing the wind shear to rip Batman from his purchase and drop down into the sea , where he is caught by Aquaman .
Batman and Ra 's then encounter Glorious Godfrey .
Glorious Godfrey 's reason to come to Earth is to retrieve the Chaos Shard , a powerful crystal once belonged to Darkseid which Ra 's al Ghul revealed was hidden inside the sarcophaus he crafted for Damian .
During Batman Eternal , Bruce briefly speculates that Ra 's is the mastermind behind most of the attacks against him that have left Wayne Enterprises bankrupt and Batman pushed to the limit .
However , when he confronts Ra 's , his foe reveals that , while he was invited to participate in the attack by the true mastermind , he rejected the offer as Ra 's would prefer to destroy Batman when the Dark Knight believes that his legacy will be as eternal as Ra 's , rather than tear him down in such a manner .
DC REBIRTH Section::::DC Rebirth .
Ra 's al Ghul is featured in Detective Comics issues # 953 - 956 as part of the " League of Shadows " story arc , which runs from issue # 951 - 956 ( April â€“ July 2017 ) .
Ra 's al Ghul appears in Dark Nights :
Metal issue # 2 as a member of the Immortals , a group formed by the oldest beings in the multiverse .
He participates in a discussion on how they will fight the Dark Multiverse invasion .
POWERS , ABILITIES , AND WEAPONS Section::::Powers , abilities , and weapons .
Due to his expanded life span , Ra 's has accumulated a vast knowledge of hand - to - hand combat , chemistry , detective artistry , physics , and martial arts ( all of which are greater than that of Batman ) .
He has also gained many international contacts and a vast fortune over the course of centuries .
When in combat , he favors more ancient weaponry ( as he has had more time to utilize them than more modern weaponry ) .
These weapons include scimitars , katana , bolas , throwing stars ( shuriken ) , smoke pellets , and miniaturized explosives .
Ra 's is also assisted by his devoted , musclebound servant Ubu .
Ra 's ' greatest tools are his Lazarus Pits , which heal any injury including recent death and restore the user back to the prime of life , but cause temporary insanity ( or , for those already insane like the Joker , sanity ) .
His constant exposure to the pits have granted him slightly enhanced endurance , strength , and healing but also comes with the price of a gradual onset of insanity if overused .
Along with his physical abilities and resources , Ra 's al Ghul has been shown to possess a certain degree of proficiency with mysticism .
In an effort to guarantee his continued existence , he has on several occasions demonstrated the ability to transfer his soul into the bodies of others , giving him a way to live on in the event that his physical body is destroyed and unable to be transported into a Lazarus Pit .
The exact details of this process have remained inconsistent ; at times it appears as though a complicated ritual is required to achieve this effect , while on other occasions he is capable of performing this feat on a whim , merely by making physical contact with his intended host .
In the New 52 , Ra 's temporarily gained vast magical powers after bathing in the Well of Sins , the first Lazarus Pit .
He claimed he was gifted with true immortality and displayed powers such as levitation , energy projection and construct creation and matter manipulation .
However , he lost these abilities following his battle with Jason Todd .

He was also referred to as Ash'Shabah Al - Abyad ( ) , meaning " the White Ghost " .
Though little is known about his past , it is stated that he was born out of a union meant to strengthen his father 's hold over " some long - extinct people " , suggesting that he was older than Ra 's ' other children .

( Arabic : Ø¯Ù…ÙŠØ§Ù† Ø§Ù„ØºÙˆÙ„ ) by Grant Morrison and Andy Kubert in 2006 .
Damian is the son of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul , making him the grandson of Ra 's al Ghul .
He is a Heir to the Demon Head and expected to one day lead the League .
Ra 's raised him to be the new Alexander the Great .
He is bred from birth to take and rule the world by his mother Talia al Ghul .
He was very aggressive until he met his father , Batman .
Batman taught him how to calm himself and trained him to be the new Robin .
His genetic perfection and genetic makeup unfortunately marked him as the ideal host for his grandfather who wants to take over his body .
MARA AL GHUL Section::::Mara al Ghul .
Created by Benjamin Percy and Jonboy Meyers , the character debuted in Teen Titans Vol.6 in December 2016 .
Mara al Ghul is a granddaughter of Ra 's al Ghul , daughter to the late Dusan al Ghul and a cousin to Damian Wayne .

She and Damian were both members of the Demon 's Fist , an elite group within in the League .
Damian was supposed to lead the Demon 's Fist but Mara now leads the group since Damian 's choosing his father over the League .

Like the rest of her family , she is a skilled fighter and is also noted to be a talented artist .
ATHANASIA AL
GHUL Section::::Athanasia al Ghul .
Athanasia al Ghul is a character featured so far only in the Injustice 2 prequel comics and does not appear in the prime earth continuity .
She is the daughter of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul , sister of Damian Wayne and granddaughter of Ra 's al Ghul .
Athanasia is the secret daughter of Talia and Bruce and raised by Talia without Bruce or even Damian 's knowledge .
While Talia allowed Damian to become a hero and work with his father for a time , Talia kept Athanasia a secret from her father and raised her as a member of the League of Assassins .
Athanasia is first seen beside her mother Talia breaking her brother Damian out of prison .
She is insulted by Damian 's apparent rudeness and wants him to say please before letting him out .
When Warden Dan Turpin tries to arrest them
she kills him and the guards .
While exiting the building Damian tells his mother to control her ' servant ' , Athanasia , who then assaults him .
It is only then that Talia reveals Athanasia is Damian 's sister and the " Daughter of the Bat " .
After the fall of Superman 's regime Athanasia and the rest of the League come out of hiding .
She works alongside her mother and grandfather in a scheme to reclaim the Earth from humans who were destroying it .
During a fight with Batman in their secret base in the Amazon Rainforest Athanasia was seemingly killed when El Diablo exploded and Athanasia was n't shielded by the blast .
She later appeared again alongside her grandfather in Gorilla City as King Solovar 's guests .
OTHERS Section::::Others .
Although he fathered children with several women , Ra 's al Ghul has only two confirmed marriages .
The first was to Sora , whose death set Ra 's on the path to becoming the " Demon 's Head " .
The second was to Melisande , Talia 's mother .
Ra 's also appears to have an unnamed sister or half - sister , a female assassin belonging to a group called the " Daughters of Acheron " , whose members share the same father .
Another member is a woman using the alias " Promise " .
It is unclear if their common father , " Acheron " , is in fact the Sensei ( making them all Ra 's ' half - sisters ) or if Ra 's only has one half - sister on his mother 's side .
In Batman and Robin # 12 , it is revealed that Talia has cloned her son , Damian .
The clone is , therefore , a grandson of sorts of Ra 's al Ghul .
Additionally , Nyssa once stated that she has given birth twelve times , opening the possibility of Ra 's having many other descendants .
INVOLVEMENT WITH BATMAN Section::::Involvement with Batman .
After Talia encounters and falls in love with Batman in Detective Comics # 411 ( May 1971 ) , Ra 's begins to consider Batman as a possible heir .
Ra 's first deduces Batman 's secret identity when he reasons the Dark Knight has to be rich , and learns only Bruce Wayne has bought the equipment a crime fighter would have ; he is then ready to put Batman to a final test .
Ra 's surprises Batman in the Batcave , seemingly to enlist Batman 's aid in rescuing both Talia and Dick Grayson , the first Robin , both of whom have apparently been kidnapped .
Batman soon discovers the whole affair is a charade orchestrated by Ra 's to test Batman , which he passes .
Ra 's asks Batman to become his heir , which Batman refuses , appalled by his genocidal plan to " cleanse " the world .
This story was later adapted into a two - part story in during its third season under the title " The Demon 's Quest " .
Despite being mortal enemies , Ra 's al Ghul and Batman maintain some level of respect towards one another .
Similar to The Riddler , Ra 's admires Batman 's intellectual prowess first and foremost , regularly referring to Batman as " Detective " or " The Detective " when speaking to or about him .
Despite being aware of Batman 's true identity as Bruce Wayne since their first meeting , Ra 's has never exposed that information to the public or Batman 's other foes ; something Batman once attributed to Ra 's ' personal code of honor .
However , Ra 's has repeatedly used that knowledge to his own advantage when fomenting plans and contingencies against Batman .
In the story " Resurrection Night " in Batman # 400 , Ra 's helps all of Batman 's foes to escape from Arkham Asylum and the Gotham State Penitentiary , setting them on a plan to abduct certain individuals across Gotham City who are linked in one form or another to Batman .
Ra 's ' true intent is to show Batman the folly of his efforts to protect a corrupt society , to his mind , allows criminals to exist and flourish .
Ra 's eventually uses the Pit while still healthy , both increasing his strength and putting his life at risk , in an attempt to outmatch the Dark Knight .
The plan backfires , as Ra 's is left writhing in the pit , seemingly destroyed .
OTHER VERSIONS SON OF THE DEMON
Section::::Other versions .
Section::::Son of the Demon .
In the graphic novel Son of the Demon , Ra 's successfully enlists Batman 's aid in defeating a rogue assassin and warlord , Qayin ( a variation on the spelling of Cain ) , who has murdered Ra 's ' then - wife Melisande ( Talia 's mother ) .
During this storyline , Batman marries Talia and she becomes pregnant .
Batman is nearly killed protecting Talia from the assassin 's agents .
In the end , Talia ends her relationship with Batman , unwilling to put him in danger .
She claims to have miscarried and the marriage is dissolved .
The child is eventually born and left at an orphanage ( eventually taking the name Ibn al Xu'ffasch ) .
The only identification provided is Talia 's jewel - encrusted necklace , which once belonged to Talia 's mother .
Two Elseworlds stories , Kingdom Come and Brotherhood of the Bat , feature two alternate versions of Ibn as an adult , coming to terms with his dual heritage .
For a time , DC Comics ' policy was that Son of the Demon was not canon and that Batman had no son .
The recent appearance of the child ( under the name Damian ) in an issue of Batman implies that this policy may have changed .
31ST CENTURY Section::::31st Century .
Ra 's has previously been revealed as alive in the 31st century setting of the post - Zero Hour reboot Legion of Super - Heroes , impersonating Leland McCauley .
SUPERMAN & BATMAN : GENERATIONS Section::::Superman & Batman : Generations .

With his only alternatives being a fifty - fifty chance at death in the Pit or being murdered by Ra 's ' men , Bruce agrees to the process .
He survive exposure to the Pit and subsequently uses Ra 's ' criminal empire to clandestinely set up an international humanitarian network .
He also becomes a near - immortal , aging one year for every century .

As the League of Assassins ' leader , and the father of Nyssa al Ghul and Talia al Ghul , the current individual eventually approved the training for both Malcolm Merlyn and Sara Lance ( The Canary ) .
Merlyn was trained in the advanced fighting techniques he used in his war against Oliver Queen ( the Arrow ) in season one , though Ra 's later sought to kill Merlyn for breaking the League 's code after leaving Nanda Parbat .
However , Malcolm was seemingly killed by Oliver and John Diggle at the end of season one , and Ra 's al Ghul considered the matter settled .
His daughter Nyssa also trained Sara to be an assassin , as revealed in season two .
In season two , it is revealed that Malcolm did indeed survive but neither Oliver nor the League knew he was alive as Oliver 's mother died before telling him .
He killed Sara by manipulating Oliver 's younger half sister and his daughter Thea , which reignites Ra 's ' vendetta against Malcolm .
To save his sister from Ra 's ' vengeance , Oliver falsely confesses that he was the one who killed Sara and challenges Ra 's to a trial by combat in Nanda Parbat , where he is apparently slain .
However , he narrowly survives and is healed by Tatsu Yamashiro .

Oliver worthy of being his heir ; having survived the blade of Ra 's al Ghul , Oliver must be the new Ra 's al Ghul .
