BURGLARY Burglary , also called breaking and entering and sometimes housebreaking , is an unlawful entry into a building or other location for the purposes of committing an offence .
Usually that offence is theft , but most jurisdictions include others within the ambit of burglary .
To engage in the act of burglary is to burgle in British English , a term back - formed from the word burglar , or to burglarize in American English .
COMMON - LAW DEFINITION Section::::Common - law definition .
At common law , burglary was defined by Sir Matthew Hale as : * Breaking can be either actual , such as by forcing open a door , or constructive , such as by fraud or threats .
Breaking does not require that anything be " broken " in terms of physical damage occurring .
A person who has permission to enter part of a house , but not another part , commits a breaking and entering when they use any means to enter a room where they are not permitted , so long as the room was not open to enter .
*
* Entering can involve either physical entry by a person , or the insertion of an instrument to remove property .
Insertion of a tool to gain entry may not constitute entering by itself .
Note that there must be a breaking and an entering for common - law burglary .
Breaking without entry or entry without breaking is not sufficient for common - law burglary .
* * Although rarely listed as an element , the common law required that " entry occur as a consequence of the breaking " .
For example , if a wrongdoer partially opens a window with a pry bar â€” but then notices an open door , which he uses to enter the dwelling , there is no burglary under common law .
The use of the pry bar would not constitute an entry even if a portion of the prybar " entered " the residence .
Under the instrumentality rule the use of an instrument to effect a breaking would not constitute an entry .
However , if any part of the perpetrator 's body entered the residence in an attempt to gain entry , the instrumentality rule did not apply .
Thus , if the perpetrator uses the prybar to pry open the window and then used his hands to lift the partially opened window , an " entry " would have taken place when he grasped the bottom of the window with his hands .
*
* House includes a temporarily unoccupied dwelling , but not a building used only occasionally as a habitation .
* * Night time is defined as hours between half an hour after sunset and half an hour before sunrise .
*
* Typically this element is expressed as the intent to commit a felony " therein " .
The use of the word " therein " adds nothing and certainly does not limit the scope of burglary to those wrongdoers who break and enter a dwelling intending to commit a felony on the premises .
The situs of the felony does not matter , and burglary occurs if the wrongdoer intended to commit a felony at the time he broke and entered .
*
The common - law elements of burglary often vary between jurisdictions .
The common - law definition has been expanded in most jurisdictions , such that the building need not be a dwelling or even a building in the conventional sense , physical breaking is not necessary , the entry does not need to occur at night , and the intent may be to commit any felony or theft .
The etymology originates from Anglo - Saxon or Old English , one of the Germanic languages .
According to one textbook , " The word burglar comes from the two German words , meaning " house " , and , meaning " thief " ( literally " house thief " ) .
Another suggested etymology is from the later Latin word , " to break open " or " to commit burglary " , from , meaning " fortress " or " castle " , with the word then passing through French and Middle English , with influence from the Latin , " thief " .
The British verb " burgle " is a late back - formation .
CANADA Section::::Canada .
In Canada , breaking and entering is prohibited by section 348 of the Criminal Code and is a hybrid offence .
Breaking and entering is defined as trespassing with intent to commit an indictable offence .
The crime is commonly referred to in Canada as break and enter , which in turn is often shortened to B and E. FINLAND Section::::Finland .
There is no crime of burglary as such in Finland .
In the case of breaking and entering , the Finnish penal code states that A person who unlawfully ( 1 ) enters domestic premises by force , stealth or deception , or hides or stays in such premises [ ... ] shall be sentenced for invasion of domestic premises to a fine or to imprisonment for at most six months .
However , if theft is committed during unlawful entering , then a person is guilty of theft or aggravated theft depending on the circumstances of the felony .
Aggravated theft : ( 1 )
If in the theft and the theft is aggravated also when assessed as a whole , the offender shall be sentenced for aggravated theft to imprisonment for at least four months and at most four years .
SWEDEN Section::::Sweden .
In Sweden , burglary does not exist as an offence in itself ; instead , there are two available offences .
If a person simply breaks into any premise , they are technically guilty of either unlawful intrusion ( ) or breach of domiciliary peace ( ) , depending on the premise in question .
Breach of domiciliary peace is applicable only when a person " unlawfully intrudes or remains where another has his living quarters " .
The only punishments available for any of these offences are fines , unless the offences are considered gross .
In such cases , the maximum punishment is two years ' imprisonment .
However , if the person who has forced themself into a house steals anything ( " takes what belongs to another with intent to acquire it " ) , they are guilty of ( ordinary ) theft ( ) .
However , the section regarding gross theft ( Chapter 6 , 4s of the Penal Code , ) states " in assessing whether the crime is gross , special consideration shall be given to whether the unlawful appropriation took place after intrusion into a dwelling . "
For theft , the punishment is imprisonment of at most two years , while gross theft carries a punishment of between six months and six years .
UNITED KINGDOM ENGLAND AND WALES Section::::United Kingdom .
Section::::England and Wales .
Burglary is defined by section 9 of the Theft Act 1968 , which describes two variants :
* A person is guilty of burglary if they enter any building or part of a building as a trespasser with intent to steal , inflict grievous bodily harm or do unlawful damage to the building or anything in it .
*
* A person is guilty of burglary if , having entered a building or part of a building as a trespasser , he steals or attempts to steal anything in the building , or inflicts or attempts to inflict grievous bodily harm on any person in the building .
* NORTHERN IRELAND Section::::Northern Ireland .
The offence is defined in similar terms to England and Wales by the Theft Act ( Northern Ireland ) 1969 .
SCOTLAND
Section::::Scotland .
Under Scots law , the crime of burglary does not exist .
Instead theft by housebreaking covers theft where the security of the building is overcome .
It does not include any other aspect of burglary found in England and Wales .
It is a crime usually prosecuted under solemn procedure in a superior court .
Another common law crime still used is Hamesuken , which covers forced entry into a building where a serious assault on the occupant takes place .
Common law crimes in Scotland are gradually being replaced by statutes .
UNITED STATES Section::::United States .
In the United States , burglary is prosecuted as a felony or misdemeanor and involves trespassing and theft , entering a building or automobile , or loitering unlawfully with intent to commit any crime , not necessarily a theft -- for example , vandalism .
Even if nothing is stolen in a burglary , the act is a statutory offense .
Buildings can include hangars , sheds , barns , and coops ; burglary of boats , aircraft , trucks , and railway cars is possible .
Burglary may be an element in crimes involving rape , arson , kidnapping , identity theft , or violation of civil rights ; indeed , the " plumbers " of the Watergate scandal were technically burglars .
As with all legal definitions in the U.S. , the foregoing description may not be applicable in every jurisdiction , since there are 50 separate state criminal codes , plus federal and territorial codes in force .
HOME INVASION Section::::Home invasion .
Commission of a burglary with the intention or result of confronting persons on the premises may constitute an aggravated offense known as " home invasion . "
NIGHTTIME BURGLARIES Section::::Nighttime burglaries .
In some states , a burglary committed during the hours of daylight is technically not burglary , but housebreaking .
In many jurisdictions in the U.S. , burglary is punished more severely than housebreaking .
In California , for example , burglary was punished as burglary in the first degree , while housebreaking was punished as burglary in the second degree .
California now distinguishes between entry into a residence and into a commercial building , with the burglary of a residence bearing heavier punishment .
In states that continue to punish burglary more severely than housebreaking twilight , night is traditionally defined as hours between 30 minutes after sunset and 30 minutes before sunrise .
INCHOATE CRIME Section::::Inchoate crime .
Some academics consider burglary an inchoate crime .
Others say that because the intrusion itself is harmful , this justifies punishment even when no further crime is committed .
Possession of burglars 's tools , in jurisdictions that make this an offense , has also been viewed as an inchoate crime :
FLORIDA Section::::Florida .
Under Florida State Statutes , " burglary " occurs when a person " enter[s ] a dwelling , a structure , or a conveyance with the intent to commit an offense therein , unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the defendant is licensed or invited to enter . "
Depending on the circumstances of the crime , burglary can be classified as third , second , or first - degree felonies , with maximum sentences of five years , fifteen years , and life , respectively .

It has three degrees .
Third - degree burglary is the broadest , and applies to any building or other premises .
Second - degree burglary retains the common - law element of a dwelling , and
first - degree burglary requires that the accused be in a dwelling and armed with a weapon or have intent to cause injury .
A related offense , criminal trespass , covers unlawful entry to buildings or premises without the intent to commit a crime , and is a misdemeanor or , in the third degree , a violation .
Possession of burglar 's tools , with the intent to use them to commit burglary or theft , is a misdemeanor .
MASSACHUSETTS Section::::Massachusetts .
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts uses the term " burglary " to refer to a night - time breaking and entering of a dwelling with the intent to commit a felony .
Burglary is a felony punishable by not more than twenty years ; should the burglar enter with a dangerous weapon , they may be imprisoned for life .
Unlawful entries of a structure other than a dwelling are labeled " breaking and entering " and punishments vary according to structure .
MARYLAND Section::::Maryland .
In Maryland , under title 6 , subtitle 2 of the criminal law code , the crime of burglary is divided into four degrees .
The first three degrees are felonies , while fourth - degree burglary is a misdemeanor .

Breaking and entering into a " storehouse " ( a structure other than a dwelling , also including watercraft , aircraft , railroad cars , and vessels ) with intent to commit theft , arson , or a crime of violence is second - degree burglary .
Third - degree burglary is defined as breaking and entering into a dwelling with intent to commit a crime .
Simple breaking and entering into a dwelling or storehouse without specific intent to commit an additional crime is fourth - degree burglary .
This degree also includes two other offenses that do not have breaking and entering as an element : Being in or on the yard , garden , or other property of a storehouse or dwelling with the intent to commit theft , or possession of burglar 's tools with the intent to use them in a burglary offense .
NEW HAMPSHIRE Section::::New Hampshire .
In the criminal code of New Hampshire , " A person is guilty of burglary if he enters a building or occupied structure , or separately secured or occupied section thereof , with purpose to commit a crime therein , unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the actor is licensed or privileged to enter .

WISCONSIN
Section::::Wisconsin .
In Wisconsin , burglary is committed by one who forcibly enters a building without consent and with intent to steal or to commit another felony .
Burglary may also be committed by entry to a locked truck , car or trailer or a ship .
The crime of burglary is treated as being more serious if the burglar is armed with a dangerous weapon when the burglary is committed or arms himself / herself during the commission of the burglary .
PROTECTION AGAINST BURGLARS Section::::Protection against burglars .
Protection of a household against burglars can include defences from anti - burglar paint through safety and security window film to burglar - proof doors and windows and burglar alarms .
A little over half of burglars would bypass a house if they thought it had alarm protection .
Dogs of any size can warn residents through loud barking , with larger dogs posing a threat of severe injury to an intruder .
The victim may also rightfully use self - defence in many jurisdictions .
In case of a burglar entering the house , secret stores can help protect against theft .
Ordinary places such as boxes , tables , and cabinets are prime targets of the burglar .
It 's recommended to leave fake money and jewelry in these places , which can help to preserve real valuables .
After a crime has been committed , tactics such as cocooning have been shown to dramatically reduce the incidence of repeat offences .
Cocooning involves notifying neighbours in the street that a break and enter has occurred , thereby encouraging a form of natural surveillance .
Studies show this may decrease the rate of property crime by up to 50 % in the local area .
STATISTICS BURGLARIES
BY COUNTRY Section::::Statistics .
Section::::Burglaries by country .
The UNODC notes " that when using the figures , any cross - national comparisons should be conducted with caution because of the differences that exist between the legal definitions of offences in countries , or the different methods of offence counting and recording " .
Also not every crime is reported and the rate of reported crimes may vary by countries . !
