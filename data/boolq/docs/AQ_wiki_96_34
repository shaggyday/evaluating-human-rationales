RECRUIT TRAINING Recruit training , more commonly known as basic training or colloquially boot camp , refers to the initial instruction of new military personnel .
Recruit training is a physically and psychologically intensive process , which resocializes its subjects for the demands of military employment .
MAJOR CHARACTERISTICS Section::::Major characteristics .
Initial military training is an intensive residential programme normally lasting several weeks or months , which aims to induct newly recruited military personnel into the social norms and essential tasks of the armed forces .
Common features include foot drill , inspections , physical training , weapons training , and a graduation parade .
The training process resocializes recruits to the demands made of them by military life .
Psychological conditioning techniques are used to shape attitudes and behaviours , so that recruits will obey all orders , face mortal danger , and kill their opponents in battle .
According to an expert in United States military training methods , Dave Grossman , recruit training makes extensive use of four types of conditioning techniques : role modeling , classical conditioning , operant conditioning , and brutalization .
According to the Canadian military historian Gwynne Dyer , inductees are required to partially submerge their individuality for the good of their unit ; this is essential because military organizations , unlike civilian ones , require their members to endure stress and perform actions that are normally absent in civilian life .
The resocialization of recruit training operates in several ways , as follows : CONFINEMENT AND SUPPRESSION Section::::Confinement and suppression .
Once their training has begun , the right of recruits to leave the military estate ( or to quit the armed forces ) is denied or tightly restricted .
By shaving the head , issuing uniforms , denying privacy , and prohibiting the use of first names , individuality is suppressed .
CONTROL AND CONFORMITY Section::::Control and conformity .
Recruits ' daily routine is highly controlled , in the manner of the ' total institution ' described by the Canadian - American sociologist Erving Goffman .
For example , the training regime determines how recruits must make their beds , polish boots , and stack their clothes ; mistakes are punished .
Throughout their training , recruits are conditioned to conform to military norms .
In particular , recruits are repeatedly instructed to stand , march , and respond to orders in a ritual known as foot drill , which is derived from 18th - century military practices and trains recruits to obey orders without hesitation or question .
According to Finnish Army regulations , for example , foot drill is essential for the esprit de corps and cohesion ; gets the recruits used to instinctive obedience ; enables large units to be marched and moved in an orderly manner ; and creates the basis for action in the battlefield .
STRESS AND PUNISHMENT Section::::Stress and punishment .
The training process applies stressors continuously .
Instructors may deprive recruits of sleep , food , or shelter ; shout personal insults ; use physical aggression ; or give orders intended to humiliate .
According to specialists in US recruit training , the conditions of continuous stress deplete recruits ' resistance to the demands made of them:"The intense workload and sleep restriction experienced by military recruits leaves them little attention capacity for processing the messages they receive about new norms …
Therefore , recruits should be less likely to devote their remaining cognitive effort to judging the quality of persuasive messages and will be more likely to be persuaded by the messages …
"Evidence
from Canada , the UK , the US and elsewhere shows that punishments are used routinely to condition group conformity and discourage poor performance .
The role of group punishment in Canadian army training , for example , has been described as follows:"Coming from civilian society that elevates the individual , recruits are now in a world where the institutional value of the group is supreme .
One has to be a team player or risk ostracism .
The military does things quite deliberately to intensify the power of group pressure within its ranks .
The group is made responsible for each member ...
even though it may seem manifestly unfair to make the group suffer for the individual .
"
BONDING AND THE HIERARCHY OF ESTEEM
Section::::Bonding and the hierarchy of esteem .
As a buffer against the stressful conditions of their training , the trainee group normally forms a strong bond of mutual loyalty .
Researchers in the US have described it as an intense " we - feeling " , which can feel more powerful than the civilian bonds that recruits are familiar with .
In 2006 , an official report on Australian Defence Force training explained the importance of the group bond:"Willingness to apply lethal force requires … sufficient bonding within the team to override each individual 's natural human resistance to kill .
The toughness and bonding required increases the closer the contact with the enemy .
"Recruits are taught to be proud of their identity as professional military personnel , and of their unit in particular .
Heroic regimental stories and symbols are used to ennoble the recruits ' own unit above others , and above other branches of the armed forces , thereby establishing a hierarchy of esteem ( also known as a hierarchy of respect ) ; the same stories are used to draw a contrast with inferior norms associated with civilian life .
AGGRESSION AND OBJECTIFICATION Section::::Aggression and objectification .
Evidence from Australia , the UK and the US shows that recruit training systematically stimulates aggression , particularly in those enlisted for ground close combat roles .
Bayonet practice is an example , as the strong language of this instruction from a British army corporal illustrates:"I wanna see it in your eyes that you wanna kill these fuckers .
Imagine these dummies are the fucking Taliban and they 've just killed some of your mates .
You wanna fuckin ' kill them .
Show me your war face !
[ recruits yell ]
You need some fucking more aggression , show me your war face .
"Another example is milling , an exercise used for infantry training in which pairs of recruits wearing boxing gloves punch each other in the head as aggressively as possible .
To further enable recruits to kill on demand , they are taught to objectify ( dehumanize ) their opponent in battle as an ' enemy target ' to ' be engaged ' , which will ' fall when hit ' .
FIELDCRAFT AND FITNESS Section::::Fieldcraft and fitness .
Recruits are taught the basic skills of their profession , such as military tactics , first aid , managing their affairs in the field , and the use of weaponry and other equipment .
Throughout , the physical fitness of recruits is tested and developed , although evidence from Israel , Norway , South Africa , the UK and the US has found that the heavy strain on the body also leads to a high rate of injury .
GRADUATION AND DROP - OUT Section::::Graduation and drop - out .
Recruits who complete their initial training normally take part in a graduation parade ( also called passing - out or marching - out ) .
The parade is observed by their family and friends , and senior military personnel .
Recruits then pass to the next stage of their training , if applicable .
A large minority of recruits drop out of training .
For example , attrition among British infantry recruits has been found to be above 30 % during the first 12 weeks .
Reasons for this include dismissal for behaviour problems , poor performance , or injury ; and recruits who choose to leave if and when they have a legal right to do so .
In the UK and US , younger recruits are more likely to drop out in these ways .
VARIATIONS IN RECRUIT TRAINING
Section::::Variations in recruit training .
Recruit training varies by nation according to the national requirement and can be voluntary ( volunteer military ) or mandatory ( conscription ) .
Some nations operate both volunteer and conscription systems simultaneously .
Recruit training differs according to military branch :
* Army and Marine recruits are nearly always trained in basic marksmanship with individually assigned weapons , field maintenance of weapons , physical fitness training , first aid , and basic survival techniques .
* Navy and Coast Guard training usually focuses on water survival training , physical fitness , basic seamanship , and such skills as shipboard firefighting , basic engineering , and signals .
* Air force training usually includes physical fitness training , military and classroom instructions , and field training in basic marksmanship and first aid .
The training further differs according to military role :
Recruits for close combat roles ( e.g. infantry , marines ) are trained to fight at close quarters , including with a bayonet ; training for these positions is normally more vigorous and aggressive than that for other roles ( e.g. logistics ) .
AUSTRALIA Section::::Australia .
Most of the recruit training in the Australian Army is currently held at Army Recruit Training Centre ( ARTC ) at Kapooka , near Wagga Wagga in New South Wales .
Recruit training lasts 80 days for members of the Australian Regular Army and 35 days for members of the Australian Army Reserve .
In basic training recruits are taught drill , weapons and workplace safety , basic equipment maintenance , marksmanship , fieldcraft , radio use and defensive / offensive operations .
REGIONAL FORCE SURVEILLANCE UNITS Section::::Regional Force Surveillance Units .
Training for recruits in the Regional Force Surveillance Units usually differs greatly from training in the rest of the Army .
For instance , NORFORCE recruits attend a 2-week course at the Kangaroo Flats .
Recruits from areas covered by the RFSUs often come from indigenous cultures radically different from that of the general Australian population , and as such many regular standards and methods of training are not as applicable in their case .
ROYAL MILITARY COLLEGE DUNTROON Section::::Royal Military College Duntroon .
Recruit Training for Officers in the Australian Army ( known as ICT - Initial Cadet Training ) takes place at Royal Military College , Duntroon ( RMC ) .
The ICT is conducted for approximately 7 weeks after which staff cadets continue military instruction in skills such as weapons training , military history , leadership , strategic studies and other such skills at Section , Platoon and Company levels .
Trainees at RMC hold the rank of Staff Cadet and , if successful in completing the course are commissioned as Lieutenants ( pronounced Left - tenant ) .
The overall full - time Officer Training course at RMC is 18 months long .
CANADA Section::::Canada .
Centralized recruit training in the Canadian Army did not exist until 1940 , and until the creation of Basic Training Centres across Canada , recruit training had been done by individual units or depots .
The Canadian Army , Royal Canadian Navy , and Royal Canadian Air Force were unified into one service , the Canadian Forces in 1968 .
The Canadian Forces Training System , a unified system for all the services , was devised and remains in place today .
Most non - commissioned CF recruits in the Regular Force ( full - time ) participate in the 10-week Basic Military Qualification ( BMQ ) at Canadian Forces Leadership and Recruit School at Saint - Jean - sur - Richelieu , Quebec .
Regular Force officers complete their 15-week Basic Military Officer Qualification ( BMOQ ) at CFLRS as well , before moving on to Second Language Training or their occupational training .
After basic training , personnel are trained in the specialty of their " environment " .
Members of the Royal Canadian Navy undergo a five - week sea environment training course ; with members of the Canadian Army undergo a 20-day Soldier Qualification course , while officers go through a 12-week Common Army Phase ( now renamed to Basic Military Officer Qualification - Land ) ; while members from the Royal Canadian Air Force move on directly to their trade training .
Reservists , particularly the Army Reserve , may conduct basic and trades training part - time , generally alternating weekends with their own units .
Due to increased integration of the Regular and Reserve Force , many reservists attend courses hosted by the Regular Force .
Members of the Army Reserves complete an 8-week BMQ / SQ combined course ( Basic Military Qualification and Soldier Qualification ) during the summer .
Formerly the Naval and Air Reserve jointly conduct BMQ for its recruits at the Naval Reserve Training Division Borden , Ontario equivalent to Regular Force BMQ , at Canadian Forces Base Borden .
Now the Naval Reserve conducts the Basic Military Naval Qualification in CFB Valcartier by the Canadian Forces Fleet School Québec ( a combination of recruit training and naval environmental training which leads to savings in the training ) .
Navy trains its personnel in seamanship , firefighting , damage control and other skills after BMQ , in the Naval Environmental Training Program ( NETP ) in either Esquimalt , British Columbia or Halifax , Nova Scotia .
The Royal Military College of Canada is the military academy of the Canadian Forces , and is a degree - granting university .
The Royal Military College Saint - Jean is a Canadian military academy located on the site of Fort Saint - Jean ( Quebec ) , CHINA
DENMARK Section::::Denmark .
The Danish Army conducts the HBU ( Hærens Basisuddannelse , Army Basic Training course ) at 8 bases around the country .
The course lasts four months , and has its focus on training skills used in connection with the Danish total defence , and on recruiting for the army 's international missions , and for the NCO - schools .
The recruits are technically conscripts , but during recession years , many young men and woman have volunteered for HBU .
FINLAND Section::::Finland .
Training lasts 5.5 to 11.5 months total .
All Finnish conscripts undergo two months of basic training ( peruskoulutuskausi ) , which is essentially the same for all servicemen .
It includes assault rifle ( RK-62 / RK-95 ) marksman training , few other basic weapon training , battle training , short field medic training and camping skills .
At the end of this training , all men are promoted to their first military rank .
After this , specialized training is given depending on the person ( 5,5–11,5 months ) .
The NCO trainees go to AUK ( NCO school ) and become corporals or sergeants , from which some are selected to RUK ( Reserve officer school ) and become second lieutenants .
The officer and NCO training always lasts a total of 11,5 months .
FRANCE Section::::France .
In the French army , the Formation Generale Initiale ( FGI ) is a 12 weeks course which occurs in a Centre de Formation Initiale des Militaires du Rang ( CFIM ) .
There are 10 CFIM in the country .
Prior to this course , new recruits are joining the regiment they are going to serve during 3 to 5 years for reception week where they get gears , filling administrative documents , and last medical exam before starting training = > in France any enlisted soldier signs not only for a MOS but also a unit to serve .
After completing the 12 week FGI course , recruits are receiving the AFFIM certificate ( say BCT graduation ) and are considered as private 2nd class .
After one week of leave , they go back to their regiment for the Formation de Spécialité Initiale ( FSI ) =
> MOS training
After FGI+FSI , they can start training with their platoon for external deployment .
Usually , Private 1st class rank is earned after 6 to 12 month of time in service .
For some units ( mountain troops - airborne ) , there is also during first year a Formation d'Adaptation ( FA ) for basic mountain training ( 2 × 2 weeks ) or parachute school ( 3 weeks )
Content of FGI is the following one : Drills , First aid and chemical warfare , PT and obstacle course , First weapon qualification ( FAMAS , pistol and grenade ) , Signals , Basic field and infantry training ( even if not MOS11B later on ) , Presentation of French army , soldiers duties and reports .
GERMANY
Section::::Germany .
The Allgemeine Grundausbildung ( AGA ) ( i.e. general basic training ) of the Bundeswehr covers the first three months of military service .
The contents of the " Allgemeine Grundausbildung " includes * Formal training ( ranks , flags , orders and other fundamentals ) * Weapon Drill and Basic Combat training for all soldiers ( Rifle , Pistol and machine gun drills are mandatory for every soldier )
* Theoretical Courses about Democracy and legal regulations
* Sports : the Basic Fitness Test ( BFT ) and the German Sports Badge ( DSA )
* Guard duty training ( ATB SichSdt )
* First Aid A notable peculiarity of German basic training is rooted in German military tradition that prefers initiative to obedience .
Rather than " breaking " the personality of new recruits through intimidation and aggression , German basic training generally tries to " mold " a recruit 's personality in the hope of producing soldiers with stronger personalities and more own initiative .
GREECE Section::::Greece .
While until 2000 the Greek Army was mainly conscript based , since then a large Professional Enslisted institution has been adopted , which combined with the reduction of conscript service will produce an approximate 1:1 ratio between conscript and professional enlisted .
While initially training of the two institutions was shared , it has since then diverged , and conscript training has been reduced in length while professional enlisted training has been increased .
Professional Enlisted , signing 7-year contracts , are called once per year .
They go through a 14-week initial training , which is broken into a 6-week basic training period which ends with the oathing ceremony , and a 8-week combat course .
After that period they proceed to specialty training which can last from 4 to 42 weeks .
Conscripted enlisted , serving a 9-month obligation , are called 6 times per year .
They report to various recruit camps spread over the country .
The first week is the reception week , followed by a 3-week basic soldier training course , which ends with the oathing ceremony .
Depending on their awarded specialty the conscript recruits are then transferred to specialty training camps or to operational units .
In the operational units the recruits go through a 3-week ' advanced ' recruit training course , followed occasionally ( depending on whether they have already received specialty training or not ) , by a 2 to 6 week specialty training course , conducted by the unit .
INDIA Section::::India .
The Indian military services have established numerous and distinguished academies and staff colleges across India for the purpose of training professional soldiers in new generation military sciences , warfare command and strategy , and associated technologies .
ISRAEL Section::::Israel .
The recruit training of the Israel Defense Forces ( called tironut in Hebrew ) varies depending on the unit : virtually every unusual unit completes a different training course .
Recruits are certified as riflemen after the completion of the training , while most non - combat units train in all - army bases for the certification of Rifleman 02 .
Individuals who want to become officers must apply to be trained at a facility in the Negev desert called " Bahad One " ( abbreviation of " Basis Hadracha " , Instruction Base ) .
PAKISTAN Section::::Pakistan .
The Pakistan Military Academy ( or PMA ) is a Military Academy of the Pakistan Army .
It is located at Kakul in Abbottabad in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa .
The Pakistan Military Academy is analogous to Sandhurst , West Point or Tironut and undertakes training of the prospective officers of Pakistan Army .
The academy has four training battalions and sixteen companies .
A Cadet is trained and passed out as an officer of the Pakistan Army in 2 years .
Enlisted Men undertake training at the Regimental Center of their chosen regiment .
RUSSIA
SINGAPORE
Section::::Singapore .
National Service ( NS ) in Singapore is compulsory for all able - bodied male citizens and second generation permanent residents who have reached the age of 18 .
Conscripts enlisted into the Singapore Armed Forces ( SAF ) are required to attend Basic Military Training ( BMT ) at the beginning of their NS .
They are known as Full Time National Servicemen ( NSFs ) .
Based on their Physical Employment Status ( PES ) grade determined by a pre - enlistment medical examination , NSFs may undergo either a standard , enhanced , modified , or obese BMT at the Basic Military Training Centre ( BMTC ) on the offshore island of Pulau Tekong or at the various military units that directly accept mono - intake PES A and B recruits .
Throughout their BMT , NSFs will acquire the basic skills required of a SAF soldier by : *
Executive basic drills * Physical training
* Passing the Individual Physical Proficiency Test ( IPPT )
* Operating and firing a SAR 21 assault rifle
* Throwing both practice and live SFG 87 hand grenades
* Complete a Standard Obstacle Course ( SOC ) and Battle Inoculation Course ( BIC )
* Going through a field camp At the end of BMT , NSFs will typically complete a 24 kilometer long route march in Full Battle Order ( FBO ) and attend a Passing Out Parade ( POP ) .
After BMT , NSFs will receive their posting orders to their respective vocations , which are determined by their PES status , suitability for deployment , and manpower requirements .
Some of them will be directly posted to a military unit while others may undergo vocational training at certain institutes before being posted to units .
NSFs who have performed well during BMT may progress to either the Specialist Cadet School ( SCS ) or Officer Cadet School ( OCS ) for further leadership training to become Specialists ( non - commissioned officers ) or Officers .
NSFs will serve the remaining part of their NS in their respective units until their Operationally - Ready Date ( ORD ) , whereupon they will be known as Operationally - Ready National Serviceman ( NSmen , or reservists ) .
NSmen may still be required to attend reservist training or In - Camp Training ( ICT ) for ten annual cycles .
SRI LANKA Section::::Sri Lanka .
In Sri Lanka , officer training is carried out at the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University and at the respective Military Academies of each respective service .
Recruit training for enlisted personal of the Sri Lanka Army is organised by the Army Training School and carried out at its premises and at several other locations .
Following basic training specialized training would be carried out at Regimental Training Centres .
Basic training for new recruits of the Sri Lanka Navy which is approximately six months are conducted at Advanced Naval Training Center , SLNS ' Nipuna ' ; Naval Artificer Training Institute , SLNS ' Thakshila ' , Welisara ; and at Naval Recruit Training Centres at several shore establishments .
This basic training will be followed by on - the - job training on - board fleet units and at shore establishments .
Combat Training School at SLNS ' Pandukabaya ' conducts combat training for Naval Patrolmen .
Basic training for airmen of the Sri Lanka Air Force is handled by the Training Wing of the SLAF Diyatalawa .
This is followed by secularized training at Advanced & Specialized Trade Training School .
SWEDEN Section::::Sweden .
Since conscription ended in 2010 , all recruits who seek employment within the Swedish Armed Forces have to go through Grundläggande Militär Utbildning ( GMU ) ( Basic Military Training ) for three months .
After a recruit has completed GMU , he / she may continue with further , specialized training with any of the branches of the military , as long as the candidate fits the requirements .
There is also a shorter volunteer training program for people who seek service within the Home Guard called GU - F. GU - F training takes only 14 days , but following a completed GU - F , a guardsman may go through additional training in order to specialize within the Home Guard .
Basic training as part of GMU as well as GU - F usually takes place at any of the Swedish Army training units .
UNITED KINGDOM Section::::United Kingdom .
British armed forces recruits train in two phases .
Phase One is initial recruit training lasting approximately three months , bringing all recruits to a similar standard of basic military ability .
Phase Two consists of courses of varying duration to prepare recruits for their assigned role .
Infantry training is an exception , combining Phase One and Phase Two in a course lasting six months .
The British Army , Royal Navy , Royal Marines and Royal Air Force manage their own Phase One and Phase Two training establishments .
The first six weeks of training are the most demanding .
Recruits are not permitted to leave the military estate or end their contract with the armed forces during this time .
UNITED STATES Section::::United States .
In the United States , recruit training in the U.S. Army is called Basic Combat Training ; U.S. Army Combat Arms MOS ( 11 Series , 19 series , 13 series , 12 series ) undergo OSUT ( One Station Unit Training ) which involves BCT , Advanced Individual Training and Specialized Training ( such as Bradley , or Mortar School , or Gunnery ) all in one .
In the U.S. Air Force it is called Basic Military Training or " BMT " .
In the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps it is called Recruit Training ( commonly known as Boot Camp ) , and in the U.S. Coast Guard , it is called " Basic Training . "
Some services present a badge or other award to denote completion of recruit training .
The Army typically issues the Army Service Ribbon ( issued after completion of Advanced Individual Training ) , and the Air Force presents the Air Force Training Ribbon and the Airman 's Coin .
The Marine Corps issue the Eagle , Globe , and Anchor once initial training is complete to signify that the recruits are now Marines .
The Navy replaces the " RECRUIT " ball cap the recruits have worn throughout training with the " NAVY " ball cap upon successful completion of " Battle Stations " .
The United States Coast Guard 's basic training graduates place a Coast Guard Medallion on their ball cap .
For honor graduates of basic training , the Air Force , Coast Guard , and Navy present a Basic Training Honor Graduate Ribbon .
The Navy and Marine Corps often meritoriously advance the top graduates of each division one pay - grade ( up to a maximum of E-3 ) .
U.S. ARMY Section::::U.S. Army .
In the United States Army , recruits are sent to Basic Combat Training in a location designated according to the military Military Occupational Specialty , or MOS , which is selected upon enlistment .
Initial Entry Training ( IET ) is divided into two parts , which commonly take place at two different locations , depending on the chosen MOS : * Basic Combat Training , or BCT , is a ten - week training cycle .
Keep in mind , this period does not include " Reception Week " during which recruits are being slotted to their training companies ( troops for cavalry ) .
* Advanced Individual Training , or AIT , is where new soldiers receive specific training in their chosen MOS .
The length of AIT training varies depending on the MOS and can last anywhere from four weeks to nearly one year .
* Several MOSs ( mainly combat arms ) combine both basic training and AIT in a single combined course called One Station Unit Training ( OSUT ) , which can last up to 22 weeks .
The attitude and environment remain the same throughout the entire training cycle , including drill instructors .
Essentially , OSUT is an extended version of Basic Training , especially for Infantry OSUT , which remains on the same basic soldiering tasks for the entire cycle , although in greater detail .
Infantry OSUT is conducted at the United States Army Infantry School at Fort Benning , and lasts 15–17 weeks .
The U.S. Army has four sites for BCT :
* Fort Benning in Columbus , Georgia * Fort Jackson in Columbia , South Carolina
* Fort Leonard Wood in St. Robert , Missouri * Fort Sill in Lawton ,
Oklahoma
During Basic Combat Training , Army recruits learn a variety of basic combat skills including : Basic Rifle Marksmanship ( BRM ) , land navigation , patrolling , securing and defending a position , drill and ceremony , fireteam formations and assaults , communications and use of AN / PRC-119 radio , combat lifesaving skills , 9-line medevac , reporting intelligence , hand grenades , Claymore mines ,
M203 / M320 grenade launcher ,
M249 Squad Automatic Weapon ( SAW ) ,
M240B machine gun , M2 .50 caliber machine gun , MK-19 , and AT-4 anti - tank weapon .
Training also includes combat conditioning by running an obstacle course , the Confidence Course , conducting marches of varying distances up to 12 miles , physical training , and Modern Army Combatives Program ( MACP ) , a martial arts program based on the combination of Brazilian jiu - jitsu , Wrestling , Judo , Muay Thai , Boxing , and a number of others .
Recruits are trained to adopt the Army " Warrior Ethos " , and to memorize and live by the Soldier 's Creed .
BCT is divided into three phases .
During Phase I , ( also known as " Red Phase " )
recruits are subject to " Total Control , " meaning their every action is monitored and constantly corrected by drill sergeants .
The first week of training is commonly referred to as " Hell Week , " due to the intense period of adjustment required on the part of the new recruits .
Marches are common throughout basic training .
Recruits are sent to the " gas chamber " during Phase I , as part of training for defensive chemical warfare .
They are also introduced to their standard - issue weapon , the M16A2 rifle , the M16A4 rifle , or M4 carbine .
In Phase II ( also known as " White Phase " )
soldiers begin actually firing weapons , starting with the rifle or carbine ( M4A1 ) .
Other weapons the recruit becomes familiarized with include various grenades ( such as the M67 fragmentation grenade ) and grenade launchers ( such as the M203 ) .
Recruits are then familiarized with the bayonet , anti - tank / armor weaponry and other heavy weapons .
The course also includes an obstacle course which the soldiers are expected to negotiate in a certain amount of time .
Additionally , Phase II includes continual , intense PT , along with drill and ceremony training .
At the conclusion of Phase II , Soldiers are to demonstrate proficiency with the various weaponry with which they trained .
Phase III or " Blue Phase , " is the culmination and the most challenging of all the training phases .
A final PT test is administered during the first week .
Recruits who fail are frequently retested , often up until the morning of their cycle 's graduation .
If they do not pass , then they are recycled to another platoon until they meet the fitness standards .
The final PT Test is the Army Physical Fitness Test ( APFT ) .
Usually , a Soldier needs to score at least 60 points in each APFT category ( pushups , sit - ups , and 2 mile run ) to pass , but in Basic Combat Training , only 50 points are required ; the Soldier will nevertheless take another APFT with a 60-point requirement at AIT .
During Blue Phase , the recruits move on to such longer and more intensive " bivouac " and FTX ( Field Training Exercises ) as nighttime combat operations .
Drill sergeants will make much of this an adversarial process by working against the recruits in many of the night operations and trying to foil plans , etc .
Upon completion of Basic Combat Training , a recruit is now a soldier , and has developed skills to operate in a combat environment , as a basic rifleman and to perform his or her MOS - specific duties under fire .
U.S. MARINE CORPS Section::::U.S. Marine Corps .
The United States Marine Corps Recruit Depots are located at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island , South Carolina , and Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego , California .
All female enlisted Marines go to Parris Island .
Men go to either , depending on whether they were recruited east or west of the Mississippi River .
Marine Corps boot camp is the longest basic training regimen in the U.S. Armed Forces , excluding Army OSUT , and is physically demanding .
Formerly , recruits were referred to as either " ( the ) Private(s ) " or " ( the ) recruit(s ) " from day one of Recruit Training .
Since the 1990s , they are referred to as " ( the ) recruit(s ) " alone until they earn the title of Marine .
Marine Corps Recruit Training ( MCRT ) is a 13-week program that is divided up into three four - week phases and further broken down into individual training days .
While there are 69 individual training days , recruits also go through pre- and post - training processing where recruits are afforded relatively little freedom .
Phase one mainly consists of learning recruit life protocol , physical training , MCMAP training , academic classes , initial drill , a series inspection , and the confidence course .
West coast recruits also do swim qualification during this phase .
Phase two is completely in the field at Camp Pendleton for west coast recruits , with the first two weeks being spent on marksmanship training and qualification with the M16A4 service rifle , and the last week in the field learning skills such as fireteam formations , land navigation , and hikes .
For east coast recruits , phase two is swim qualification , rifle qualification , and Team Week , a week of maintenance duties for the island as a show of how to perform base support tasks while still keeping military bearing and attention to detail .
Phase three brings the San Diego recruits back to the recruit depot where they finish up with final drill , final inspection , more PT and confidence courses , and graduation .
During third phase , west coast recruits also go back into the field one last time to do the Crucible event .
Parris Island recruits finish with field training , final drill and inspection , the Crucible , and graduation .
Note that recruits going to either depot receive exactly the same training , if in a different order .
An important part of this process is training recruits to adopt and live by the motto , " Every Marine a rifleman " .
Upon completion , recruits proceed to receive further training at the School of Infantry ( SOI ) .
All non - infantry MOS Marines are trained at the Marine Combat Training Battalion ( MCT ) , while infantry MOS Marines are trained at the Infantry Training Battalion ( ITB ) .
MCT and ITB training is conducted at one of two locations , SOI - East at Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville , North Carolina ( for Parris Island graduates ) and SOI - West at Camp Pendleton in San Diego , California ( for San Diego graduates ) .
Marine Combat Training Battalion ( MCT ) is a 29-day course .
Marines learn the basics of combat marksmanship , counter - improvised explosive device techniques , how to conduct the defense of a position , convoy operations , combat formations , fireteam assaults , patrolling , MOUT , use of the AN / PRC-119 radio , reporting military intelligence , land navigation , and the use of hand grenades , the M203 grenade launcher , M249 Squad Automatic Weapon , and M240 machine gun .
Training also includes combat conditioning by running an obstacle course , conducting marches , physical training , and Marine Corps Martial Arts Program .
Upon completion of Marine Combat Training , the Marine is to have gained the knowledge and ability to operate in a combat environment as a basic rifleman and to perform his or her primary duties under fire .
( The main contrast with Army recruit training is that nearly identical training is integrated into Basic Combat Training , so there is no follow - on school . )
Upon completion , Marines proceed to their MOS - specific school .
In Infantry Training Battalion ( ITB ) , infantry MOS ( 03XX ) Marines receive 59 days of training in infantry skills , including advanced marksmanship , combat patrolling , land navigation , and a wide array of other infantry skills .
Upon completion of ITB , newly qualified Marine infantrymen proceed to their assigned units .
U.S. NAVY Section::::U.S. Navy .
The United States Navy currently operates boot camp at Recruit Training Command Great Lakes , located at Naval Station Great Lakes , near North Chicago , Illinois .
Instead of having Drill Sergeants or Drill Instructors like other branches of the U.S. Armed Forces , the U.S. Navy has RDCs ( Recruit Division Commanders ) that are assigned to each division .
Training lasts approximately eight weeks ( although some recruits will spend as many as nine weeks in training due to the somewhat complicated processing cycle ) .
Days are counted by a system that lists the week and day that they are on , for example , 7 - 3 for week 7 day 3 .
The first approximate week is counted P-1 , P-2 , etc .
which denotes that it is a processing day and does not count as part of their 8-week training period .
Recruits are instructed on military drill , basic seamanship , basic shipboard damage control , firefighting , familiarization with the M9 pistol and Mossberg
500 shotgun ( the Navy no longer gives instruction on the M16 in boot camp ) , pass the confidence chamber ( tear - gas - filled chamber ) , PT , and the basic essentials on Navy life .
Recruits also attend many classes throughout boot camp on subjects such as Equal Opportunity , Sexual Assault Victim Intervention , Uniform Code of Military Justice , recognition of naval aircraft and vessels , and more .
In order for recruits to pass boot camp , they are physically and mentally tested on a 12-hour exercise called Battle Stations which consists of 12 different scenarios involving firefighting , first - aid knowledge , survival at sea , mass casualties , shipboard flood control , bomb detection , and many other skills that they have been learning in the previous 7 weeks .
After completion of boot camp , freshly minted Sailors are sent either to various " A " Schools located across the United States — where they begin training to receive their ratings ( jobs)—or to apprenticeship training , where they then enter the fleet without a designation .
The Navy formerly operated Recruit Training Centers in San Diego , California ; Orlando , Florida ; Meridian , Mississippi ; and Port Deposit ( Bainbridge ) , Maryland .
From 1942 to 1946—during and immediately following World War II — the Navy had two additional training sites : Naval Training Station ( USNTS )
Sampson ( renamed Sampson Air Force Base in 1950 ) , near Seneca Lake , New York , where over 400,000 recruits were trained , and Farragut Naval Training Station in Bayview , Idaho .
U.S. AIR FORCE Section::::U.S. Air Force .
The U.S. Air Force 's Basic Military Training ( BMT ) is eight and a half weeks long , as they do not count the first week ( " Week 0 " ) .
BMT is 63 calendar days long .
It is conducted at Lackland AFB in San Antonio , Texas .
Formerly , trainees were referred to as " Airman " from day one of BMT .
This has been changed ; now , personnel are referred to as Trainees until the Airman 's Coin Ceremony in the seventh week of training , when they receive their Airman 's Coin .
Trainees receive military instruction ( including the Air Force core values , flight and individual drill , and living area inspections ) , academic classes ( covering topics such as Air Force history , dress and appearance , military customs and courtesies , ethics , security , and alcohol / drug abuse prevention and treatment ) , and field training ( including protection against biological and chemical attack , basic marksmanship on the M16 rifle as well as first aid ) .
Following BMT , Airmen go to a technical school ( or ' tech school ' ) where they learn the specifics of their Air Force Specialty Code ( AFSC ) , which is similar to the MOS ( Military Occupational Specialty ) in the Army and Marines , the Navy 's NEC ( Naval Enlisted Classification ) code , or the Coast Guard 's ratings .
All non - prior - service enlistees are required to complete BMT , including those enlisting in the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command .
Reserve component enlistees receive the same training as their active - duty counterparts .
Credit can be given on a case - by - case basis for enlistees with college credit , Eagle Scouts and service in the Civil Air Patrol qualify for promotion to
E-2 ( Airman ) or E-3 ( Airman First Class ) upon graduation from BMT .
The stripes are not worn until graduation , though trainees are paid at the higher pay grade .
Lackland AFB has been associated with BMT for almost the Air Force 's entire history .
From 1950 to 1956 , 300,000 airmen received BMT at Sampson Air Force Base in New York .
In 1951 , Parks Air Force Base in Dublin , California became a BMT center , with training beginning in March 1952 .
BMT at Parks AFB ceased later in the decade and the installation was transferred to the US Army in 1959 .
For a brief time between 1966 and 1968 , the Air Force operated a second BMT at Amarillo AFB in Amarillo , Texas .
Unlike the Army and Navy , but like the Marine Corps ( throughout boot camp ) and Coast Guard ( during the first section of boot camp ) , trainees are required to refer to all Airmen , enlisted and NCO 's as well as commissioned and warrant officers , as " sir " or " ma'am " .
Trainees are required to preface speaking to Military Training Instructors with their reporting statement : " Sir / Ma'am , Trainee ( the recruit 's surname ) reports as ordered " .
An additional 2 weeks of BMT was added to the program on November 1 , 2008 , extending the duration of BMT from six and a half weeks to eight and a half weeks .
BMT has been tailored to incorporate some of the additional warfighting skills to coincide with increased Air Expeditionary Force ( AEF ) rotations and more frequent support of its sister services during those rotations .
In 2015 BMT was shortened once again to seven and a half weeks .
Trainees still stay at Lackland for eight and half weeks , however , the eighth week following graduation they are moved to a more relaxed environment under a program called Airman 's Week , which is designed to transition trainees to technical training .
U.S.
COAST GUARD Section::::U.S. Coast Guard .
Recruit training for the U.S. Coast Guard is held at Coast Guard Training Center Cape May in Cape May , New Jersey .
The official standard recruit training cycle lasts eight weeks .
A limited number of recruits may face reversion to earlier weeks of training should one exhibit egregious deficiencies in attitude and/or aptitude .
The U.S. Coast Guard recruit basic training offers an additional , abbreviated , route to serve as an enlisted member of the Fleet .
Namely , Direct Entry Petty Officer Training ( DEPOT ) : " The goal of the Direct Entry Petty Officer Training Course is to produce petty officers who on the basis of their civilian professions , prior military experience , or a combination of both " are otherwise duly qualified .
The U.S. Coast Guard is unique in that it fires the SIG Sauer P229R pistol during the training .
The training also covers basic seamanship , drill , military bearing and firefighting .
The Coast Guard base on Government Island ( now known as Coast Guard Island )
Alameda , California was also used as a second major recruit training center until it was closed in 1982 and converted into the base for the USCG Pacific Area Command , the Eleventh Coast Guard District , the Marine Safety Office San Francisco Bay , the USCG Maintenance & Logistics Command Pacific and the Integrated Support Command Center - Alameda .
Although the Coast Guard is a part of the Department of Homeland Security , rather than the Department of Defense , it is by law and tradition a branch of the United States Armed Forces .
As with all military members , Coast Guard personnel are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice ( UCMJ ) .
Due to the Coast Guard 's unique mission set – including CONUS and OCONUS defense operations , search and rescue and maritime law enforcement – there are added requirements to maintain high physical fitness standards and intense military bearing .
Due to its extremely unusual , diverse and difficult mission , the U.S. Coast Guard is the most selective in recruiting and training standards .
As an example , the Coast Guard Academy is the only service academy that uses competitive admissions for prospective officer candidates .
During their time at Cape May , recruits are subjected to the usual " boot camp " atmosphere of direct instruction and intense motivation .
The recruits are designated as Seaman Recruits ( SR ; E-1 ) .
Unique to the Coast Guard among the services , recruits successfully completing basic recruit training are advanced to the rank of Seaman Apprentice / Fireman Apprentice ( SA / FA ; E-2 ) or Seaman / Fireman ( SN / FN ;
E-3 ) upon graduation — the difference generally based on level of higher education one possess .
They must adhere to strict rules such as hygiene and uniform regulations and obey all lawful orders .
Coast Guard drill instructors are called " company commanders " and hold a rank ranging from Petty Officer 2nd Class ( E-5 ) up to Senior Chief Petty Officer ( E-8 ) .
Coast Guard companies have approximately two or three company commanders and anywhere from 20 to over 100 recruits .
After completing boot camp , recruits can select their rate and then attend an " A " school .
Not all graduates go straight to " A " school , many spend time in the fleet as " non - rates " .
" A " school is a long - term technical school providing specific instruction about a rate .
The " A " schools last two to six months and usually occurs at TRACEN Yorktown , Yorktown , Virginia or TRACEN Petaluma , Petaluma , California .
Some rates have an available apprenticeship training option instead of attending an " A " school , known as " striking " .
