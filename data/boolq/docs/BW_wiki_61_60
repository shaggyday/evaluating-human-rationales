PHENYLEPHRINE
Phenylephrine is a selective α - adrenergic receptor agonist of the phenethylamine class used primarily as a decongestant , as an agent to dilate the pupil , to increase blood pressure , and to relieve hemorrhoids .
Phenylephrine is marketed as an alternative for the decongestant pseudoephedrine , although clinical trials show phenylephrine , taken orally at the recommended dose , to be no more effective than placebo for allergy relief .
Phenylephrine can also cause a decrease in heart rate through reflex bradycardia .
MEDICAL USES
DECONGESTANT Section::::Medical uses .
Section::::Decongestant .
Phenylephrine is used as a decongestant sold as an oral medicine or as a nasal spray .
It is a common ingredient in over - the - counter decongestants in the United States .
Other decongestants include oxymetazoline and pseudoephedrine .
Phenylephrine is used as an alternative for pseudoephedrine in decongestant medicines due to pseudoephedrine 's use in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine .
Its efficacy as an oral decongestant has been questioned , with several recent independent studies finding that it provided no more relief to sinus congestion than a placebo .
Pharmacists Leslie Hendeles and Randy Hatton of the University of Florida suggested in 2006 that oral phenylephrine is ineffective as a decongestant at the 10-mg dose used , arguing that the studies used for the regulatory approval of the drug in the United States in 1976 were inadequate to prove effectiveness at the 10-mg dose , and safety at higher doses .
A 2007 meta - analysis by Hatton et al . concluded that the evidence for its effectiveness is insufficient , though another meta - analysis published shortly thereafter by researchers from GlaxoSmithKline found the standard 10-mg dose to be significantly more effective than a placebo ; however , the fact that GSK markets many products containing phenylephrine has raised some speculation regarding selective publishing and other controversial techniques .
A 2007 study by Wyeth Consumer Healthcare notes that 7 studies available in 1976 support the efficacy of phenylephrine at a 10 mg dosage .
Two studies published in 2009 examined the effects of phenylephrine on symptoms of allergic rhinitis by exposing sufferers to pollen in a controlled , indoor environment .
Neither study was able to distinguish between the effects of phenylephrine or a placebo .
Pseudoephedrine and loratadine - montelukast therapy were found to be significantly more effective than both phenylephrine and placebo .
The Food and Drug Administration has stood by its 1976 approval of phenylephrine for nasal congestion as the debate continues .
HEMORRHOIDS
Section::::Hemorrhoids .
Hemorrhoids are caused by swollen veins in the rectal area .
Phenylephrine can be used topically to prevent symptoms of hemorrhoids .
Phenylephrine causes the constriction of vascular smooth muscle and is often used in the treatment of hemorrhoids presumably to narrow the swollen veins and relieve the attendant pain .
However , veins — unlike arteries — contain less vascular smooth muscle in their walls so the mechanism by which pain relief is achieved is likely related to something other than vascular change alone .
Products for treatment may also include substances that will form a protective barrier over the inflamed area , resulting in less pain when feces are passed .
PUPIL DILATION Section::::Pupil dilation .
Phenylephrine is used as an eye drop to dilate the pupil to facilitate visualization of the retina .
It is often used in combination with tropicamide as a synergist when tropicamide alone is not sufficient .
Narrow - angle glaucoma is a contraindication to phenylephrine use .
As a mydriatic , it is available in 2.5 % and 10 % minims .
Phenylephrine eye drops are applied to the eye after a topical anesthetic is applied .
VASOPRESSOR Section::::Vasopressor .
Phenylephrine is commonly used as a vasopressor to increase the blood pressure in unstable patients with hypotension , especially resulting from septic shock .
Such use is common in anesthesia or critical - care practices ; it is especially useful in counteracting the hypotensive effect of epidural and subarachnoid anesthetics , as well as the vasodilating effect of bacterial toxins and the inflammatory response in sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome .
The elimination half life of phenylephrine is about 2.5 to 3.0 hours .
The clinical effects of a single intravenous bolus dose of phenylephrine are short lived and needs to be repeated every 10–15 minutes .
Commonly the drug is given as a carefully titrated intravenous infusion with a syringe pump or volumetric pump .
Because of its vasoconstrictive effect , phenylephrine can cause severe necrosis if it infiltrates the surrounding tissues .
Because of this , it should be given through a central line if at all possible .
Damage may be prevented or mitigated by infiltrating the tissue with the alpha blocker phentolamine by subcutaneous injection .
Phenylephrine hydrochloride at 0.25 % is used as a vasoconstrictor in some suppository formulations .
Recently , Phenylephrine has been used to treat conditions of orthostatic intolerance such as Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome - where by activation of venous alpha 1 adrenoreceptors increases venous return and stroke volume which improves symptoms .
PRIAPISM Section::::Priapism .
Phenylephrine is used by urologists to abort priapism .
It is diluted with normal saline and injected directly into the corpora cavernosa .
The mechanism of action is to cause constriction of the blood vessels entering into the penis , thus causing decreased blood flow and relieving the priapism .
An injection is given every 3–5 minutes .
If priapism is not resolved in 1 hour , another form of therapy is considered .
SIDE EFFECTS HEART Section::::Side effects .
Section::::Heart .
The primary side effect of phenylephrine is high blood pressure .
People with high blood pressure are typically advised to avoid products containing it .
Because this medication is a sympathomimetic amine without beta - adrenergic activity , it does not increase contractility force and output of the cardiac muscle .
It may increase blood pressure resulting in a slow heart rate through stimulation of vascular ( likely carotid ) baroreceptors .
A common side effect during IV administration is reflex bradycardia .
The low concentration eye drops do not cause blood pressure changes and the changes with the higher dose drops
do not last long .
OTHER Section::::Other .
Prostatic hyperplasia can also be worsened by use , and chronic use can lead to rebound hyperemia .
People with a history of anxiety or panic disorders , or on anticonvulsant medication for epilepsy should not take this substance .
The drug interaction might produce seizures .
Some patients have been shown to have an upset stomach , severe abdominal cramping , and vomiting issues connected to taking this drug .
Phenylephrine is
pregnancy category C. Due to the lack of studies done in animals and in humans , it is not known whether there is harm to the fetus .
Phenylephrine should only be given to pregnant women who have a clear need .
Extended use may cause rhinitis medicamentosa , a condition of rebound nasal congestion .
INTERACTIONS
Section::::Interactions .
The increase in blood pressure effect of phenylephrine may be increased by drugs such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors , tricyclic antidepressants , and hydrocortisone .
Patients taking these medications may need a lower dose of phenylephrine to achieve a similar increase in blood pressure .
Drugs that may decrease the effects of phenylephrine may include calcium channel blockers , ACE inhibitors and benzodiazepines .
Patients taking these medications may need a higher dose of phenylephrine to achieve a comparable increase in blood pressure .
MECHANISM OF ACTION Section::::Mechanism of action .
Oral phenylephrine is extensively metabolized by monoamine oxidase , an enzyme that is present on the outside of cells , throughout the body .
Compared to intravenous pseudoephedrine , phenylephrine has a reduced and variable bioavailability ; only up to 38 % .
Phenylephrine is a sympathomimetic drug , which means that it mimics the actions of epinephrine ( commonly known as adrenaline ) or norepinephrine .
Phenylephrine selectively binds to alpha receptors which cause blood vessels to constrict .
Phenylephrine may cause side effects such as headache , reflex bradycardia , excitability , restlessness and cardiac arrhythmias .
Phenylephrine is not suggested for use in patients with hypertension .
Whereas pseudoephedrine causes both vasoconstriction and increase of mucociliary clearance through its nonspecific adrenergic activity , phenylephrine 's selective α - adrenergic agonism causes vasoconstriction alone , creating a difference in their methods of action .
SUBSTITUTE FOR PSEUDOEPHEDRINE Section::::Substitute for pseudoephedrine .
Pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine are both used as decongestants ; and , until recently , pseudoephedrine was much more commonly available in the United States .
This has changed because provisions of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 placed restrictions on the sale of pseudoephedrine products to prevent the clandestine manufacture of methamphetamine .
Since 2004 , phenylephrine has been increasingly marketed as a substitute for pseudoephedrine ; some manufacturers have changed the active ingredients of products to avoid the restrictions on sales .
Phenylephrine has been off patent for some time , and many generic brands are available .
