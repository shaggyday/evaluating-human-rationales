RUSSELL GROUP
The Russell Group is a self - selected association of twenty - four public research universities in the United Kingdom .
The group is headquartered in London and was established in 1994 to represent its members ' interests , principally to government and parliament .
It was incorporated in 2007 .
As of 2017 , Russell Group members receive over three quarters of all university research grant and contract income in the United Kingdom .
The group is widely perceived as representing the best universities in the country , although this is disputed .
Russell Group members award 60 % of all doctorates gained in the United Kingdom .
In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework , 68 % of world - leading ( 4 * ) research and 68 % of research with an outstanding ( 4 * ) impact was carried out in Russell Group universities .
Of the 21 Russell Group universities that have chosen to enter the Teaching Excellence and Student Outcomes Framework ( TEF ) , 10 hold gold awards ( 48 % ) , 10 silver ( 48 % ) and one bronze ( 5 % ) , compared to proportions across all higher education providers with full awards of 27 % gold , 50 % silver and 23 % bronze .
The Russell Group is so named because the first informal meetings of the Group took place at the Hotel Russell in Russell Square , London .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The Russell Group was formed in 1994 by 18 British research universities – Birmingham , Bristol , Cambridge , Edinburgh , Glasgow , Imperial College London , Queen Mary , Leeds , Liverpool , London School of Economics , Manchester , Newcastle , Nottingham , Oxford , Sheffield , Southampton , University College London and Warwick , who originally met at Hotel Russell shortly before meetings of the Committee of Vice - Chancellors and Principals ( now Universities UK ) in nearby Tavistock Square , close to the University of London buildings and , particularly , Senate House .
In 1998 Cardiff University and King 's College London joined the group .
In March 2001 the Russell Group decided against selecting a preferred option for the future funding of higher education , stating that endowments , a graduate contribution , increased public funding and top - up fees should all remain options .
In December 2005 it was announced that the Russell Group would be appointing its first full - time director - general as a result of a planned expansion of its operations , including commissioning and conducting its own policy research .
In November 2006 Queen 's University Belfast was admitted as the twentieth member of the group .
In the same month Wendy Piatt , the then deputy director in the Prime Minister 's strategy unit , was announced as the group 's new Director General and chief executive .
In March 2012
it was announced that four universities – Durham , Exeter , Queen Mary University of London ; and York – would become members of the Russell Group in August of the same year .
All of the new members had previously been members of the 1994 Group of British universities .
In January 2013 it was announced that the Russell Group would establish an academic board to advise the English exams watchdog Ofqual on the content of A - Levels .
ORGANISATION OBJECTIVES Section::::Organisation .
Section::::Objectives .
The Russell Group states that " its aim is to help ensure that our universities have the optimum conditions in which to flourish and continue to make social , economic and cultural impacts through their world - leading research and teaching . "
It works towards this by lobbying the UK government and parliament ; commissioning reports and research ; creating a forum in which its member institutions can discuss issues of common concern ; and identify opportunities for them to work together .
LEADERSHIP Section::::Leadership .
The Russell Group is led by Chief Executive Dr Tim Bradshaw and chaired by Prof Sir Anton Muscatelli , Vice - Chancellor of the University of Glasgow .
MEMBERS Section::::Members .
The Russell Group currently has twenty four members , of which twenty are from England , two from Scotland , and one from each of Wales and Northern Ireland .
Of the English members , five are from Greater London ; three from the Yorkshire and the Humber region ; two from each of the North East , North West , West Midlands , South West and South East regions ; and one from each of the East Midlands and East regions .
Four Russell Group members are constituent colleges of the University of London and a fifth London institution , Imperial College London , was part of the University of London until 2007 .

STATUS
RESEARCH Section::::Status .
Section::::Research .
In 2015/16 , following the 2014 Research Excellence Framework , the 19 English universities with HEFCE research funding allocations ( excluding transitional funding ) in excess of £ 20 million were all members of the Russell Group .
The only English Russell Group institution to receive an allocation below £ 20 M was the LSE ( £ 18.6 M ) , which ranked 22nd behind the Universities of Leicester and Lancaster ( both on £ 19 M ) .
In 2010/11 , 19 of the 20 UK universities with the highest income from research grants and contracts were members of the Russell Group .
In terms of total research funding allocations from the Higher Education Funding Council for England ( HEFCE ) in 2007/8 , the top 15 universities were all Russell Group institutions .
LSE was 21st , due to its focus on less costly social sciences research .
Queen 's University Belfast , Cardiff , Glasgow and Edinburgh , were not included in this table , as they are not English institutions .
The Russell Group institutions received 82 % of the total HEFCE research funding allocation .
The research funding figures depend on factors other than the quality of research , in particular there are variations due to institutional size and subject spread ( e.g. science , technology and medicine tend to attract more money ) .
In 2008 , 18 of the then 20 members were positioned in the top 20 of Research Fortnight 's Research Assessment Exercise ' Power ' Table .
The other two places were occupied by Durham University and Queen Mary University of London , which were not then Russell Group members but have since joined .
The two Russell Group institutions outside the top 20 were QUB ( 21st ) and the LSE ( 27th ) , while the other two universities to have since joined were York ( 22nd ) and Exeter ( 25th ) .
In the equivalent table for the 2014 Research Excellence Framework , the 24 Russell Group members occupied the top 24 positions , with the University of Lancaster in 25th being the highest - ranked non - Russell Group university .
RANKINGS Section::::Rankings .
For 2015–16 , all 8 UK universities in the ARWU top 100 , 17 of the 18 in the QS top 100 , and 15 of the 16 in the THE top 100 are members of the Russell Group ( the other place in both the QS and THE rankings being occupied by the University of St Andrews ) .
On the 2016 national tables , the Russell Group provides 7 of the top 10 in the Complete University Guide , 6 in the Guardian University Guide and 8 in the Times /
Sunday Times Good University Guide . !

All but two of the universities in the Russell Group are part of the Sutton Trust 's group of 30 highly selective universities , the Sutton Trust 30 ( the absent members being Queen Mary University of London and Queen 's University Belfast ) .
The Sutton 13 group of the 13 most highly selective universities only includes one non - Russell Group member , the University of St Andrews .
St Andrews was also the only non - Russell Group University in the top 10 by average UCAS tariff score of new undergraduate students in 2015–16 , placing fifth with an average score of 525 ( and an offer rate of 52.2 % ) .
Half of the Russell Group made offers to more than three quarter of their undergraduate applicants in 2015 . !

The Russell Group accounted for 49.1 % of the income of the higher education sector in the UK in 2013–14 , having risen from 44.7 % of the total in 2001–02 .
Over the same period the total income of Russell Group universities rose by 69.9 % in real terms , compared to a sector average of 54.4 % .
Russell Group universities are also seen as " particularly creditworthy " due to their membership of the group , allowing them to borrow money at low interest rates .
The total annual income for Russell Group members for 2016–17 was £ 16.67 billion of which £ 4.38 billion was from research grants and contracts , with an expenditure of £ 15.90 billion .

339.8 ALDWYCH GROUP Section::::Aldwych Group .
In response to the Russell Group 's support for tuition fees ( and other issues ) , in 1994 the students ' unions of the member universities formed the Aldwych Group as a parallel organisation to represent what they perceive to be the common interests of their students .
It was established by Martin Lewis ( who was general secretary of LSE Students ' Union in 1994/5 ) as a watchdog in response to the creation of the Russell Group .
It now appears to be moribund , with the website not having been updated to reflect the 2012 changes in membership of the Russell Group and containing no news items or press releases .
The Aldwych Group was so called because it was established at a meeting at the London School of Economics and Political Science , which is located on Aldwych .
Aside from the unions of the Russell Group universities ( above ) , the Aldwych Group was also observed by two other bodies :
* The National Union of Students * The National Postgraduate Committee , due to the high numbers of graduate students in the Russell Group and their research - intensive focus .
CRITICISMS ' ELITE ' STATUS QUESTIONED Section::::Criticisms .
Section::::'Elite ' status questioned .
In a statement to the Higher Education Policy Institute , David Watson of the University of Oxford suggested that the Russell Group 's claim to represent 24 ' leading universities ' was " a real stretch " .
In the context of the Russell Group 's reputation in the sector , he continued : " particularly dangerous , I think , is the bottom half of the Russell Group …
The problem with the Russell Group is that it represents neither the sector as a whole [ nor ] , in many cases , the best of the sector .
" Performance in research intensity showed that there were dozens of other UK universities " above the bottom Russellers " .
A Durham University academic , Vikki Boliver , published a report in 2015 claiming that the prestigious position of the Russell Group was not based on evidence , but rather successful marketing .
Only the universities of Oxford and Cambridge were significantly more elite than the majority of " old " universities when a grouping analysis was performed using data on academic selectivity , research activity , teaching quality , socio - economic exclusivity and economic resources .
The other 22 members of the Russell Group sit in a second tier of universities along with 18 other " old " universities ( University of Aberdeen , University of Bath * , University of Keele , University of Dundee , University of East Anglia * , Goldsmiths * , Heriot - Watt University , University of Kent , Lancaster University * , University of Leicester * , Loughborough University * , University of Reading * , Royal Holloway * , University of St Andrews * , SOAS * , University of Strathclyde , University of Surrey * and University of Sussex * ) , mostly comprising former members of the defunct 1994 Group ( shown by asterisks ) .
Another 13 " old " universities and 52 " new " universities made up a third tier , with a fourth tier of 19 " new " universities .
Within each tier , the differences between the institutions were less significant than the differences between the tiers .
This reflected an earlier result from 2010 that , when the " Golden Triangle " universities ( defined in the study as Oxford , Cambridge , Imperial , LSE , and UCL ) were omitted , the remaining ( then ) members of the Russell Group were outperformed by the ( then ) members of the 1994 Group .
Ant Bagshaw from the Wonkhe think - tank has criticised the use of Russell Group membership as a proxy for selectivity in official Department for Education reports and statistics , as better measures of selectivity are available from UCAS data .
He states that the idea that " Russell Group membership is synonymous with ' best is " persistent , but unverified " .
He also notes that this may lead to less scrutiny of the performance of non - Russell Group selective universities with respect to widening participation and improving access .
PROTECTIONISM Section::::Protectionism .
The Institute of Economic Affairs has argued that the Russell Group acts out of protectionist interests .
It is claimed that this will " restrict competition , discourage innovation and encourage inefficiency , thereby depriving students of lower prices and/or greater choice " .
TUITION FEES Section::::Tuition fees .
The Russell Group has been prominent in recent years in the debate over the introduction of tuition fees , a measure which it has strongly supported – much to the dismay of the universities ' students ' unions .
Indeed , members of the Group argued that even the fees proposed by the controversial Higher Education Bill would not be sufficient to cover the rising cost of undergraduate teaching , and successfully argued for the right to charge variable fees at much higher rates , so - called top - up fees .
