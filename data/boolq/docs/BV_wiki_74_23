JUGHANDLE
A jughandle is a type of ramp or slip road that changes the way traffic turns left at an at - grade intersection ( in a country where traffic drives on the right ) .
Instead of a standard left turn being made from the left lane , left - turning traffic uses a ramp on the right side of the road .
In a standard forward jughandle or near - side jughandle , the ramp leaves before the intersection , and left - turning traffic turns left off it rather than the through road .
Right turns are also made using the jughandle .
In a reverse jughandle or far - side jughandle , the ramp leaves after the intersection , and left - turning traffic loops around to the right and merges with the crossroad before the intersection .
The jughandle is also known as a Jersey left due to its association with the U.S. state of New Jersey , though this term is also locally used for an abrupt left at the beginning of a green light cycle .
Occasionally a setup is used where traffic on the side road can not turn left at the intersection but turns left after it , merging with the main road .
This is most often used for U - turns where a normal jughandle can not be constructed ; traffic turns left off the main road onto the ramp .
Occasionally , a jughandle is removed if turning traffic is too heavy ( see Disadvantages ) .
In at least one case ( Route 36 at Route 71 , ) in New Jersey , the jughandle was kept for left turns , but U - turns are made from a left - turn lane .
The New Jersey Department of Transportation defines three types of jughandles .
"
Type A " is the standard forward jughandle .
" Type B " is a variant with no cross - street intersected by the jughandle ; it curves 90 degrees left to meet the main street , and is either used at a " T " intersection or for a U - turn only .
" Type C " is the standard reverse jughandle .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The first mention of jughandles in the New York Times is on June 14 , 1959 , referring to jughandles having been built in New Jersey on US 46 in Montville , US 22 between North Plainfield and Bound Brook , and Route 35 at Monmouth Park Racetrack .
By the beginning of 1960 , New Jersey had 160 jughandles , most if not all standard before - intersection jughandles .
The 160th one was on U.S. Route 1 between New Brunswick and Trenton .

States with a prevalence of jughandles include New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Connecticut , Delaware , Maryland , Ohio , Massachusetts , Michigan , Missouri , New York , New Hampshire , Wisconsin , and Vermont .
Jughandles are particularly associated with New Jersey .
Jughandles are possible in other locations as they are a valid type of intersection control to consider for intersection design .
SIGNAGE Section::::Signage .
On New Jersey State Highways and Pennsylvania State Highways , a white sign is placed before a jughandle or at the beginning of a stretch of jughandles saying " All turns from right lane " .
Each jughandle is marked with a white sign below the standard green sign , saying " All turns " , or " U and left turns " in the case of a reverse jughandle .
On locally maintained roads , and in other states , jughandle signage can appear to be haphazard and confusing to out of state drivers .
Generally on Pennsylvania Route 61 , jughandles are common , and are signed as " All Turns ( up / right arrow ) " .
ADVANTAGES
* Safety
* Removes left - turning vehicles from travel lanes , particularly from higher - speed left lanes .
* Pedestrian crossing distance is reduced across the mainline .
* Reduced left - turn conflict points as compared to a standard four - leg intersection .
* Removes conflicts with right - turning vehicles and pedestrians / bicyclists at the primary intersection .
* Operations
* Reduced overall travel time and delay through the intersection .
* Reduced signal phases due to the elimination of the associated left - turn phase(s ) .
* Increases queuing space for left - turning vehicles .
*
Shorter pedestrian crossing distance across the mainline may provide for shorter cross street signal phases .
* May improve U - turns by reducing the need for a tight - radius turning maneuver which conflicts with cross - street right - turns .
*
Reduced need for rights - of - way acquisition when there is not any room for a left turning lane ; focuses land requirement near intersection rather than a long stretch that is often highly developed .
DISADVANTAGES
* Safety * Driver confusion , due to left - turns being made from the right side of the roadway — an uncommon configuration outside of the northeastern United States .
Expectancy issues may be compounded due to inconsistency between intersections , where some intersections may be jughandles and others may be standard intersections .
These issues can be reduced through advance signing .
* Pedestrian conflict is increased along the cross street due to the addition of an additional intersecting approach .
* Creates a higher - speed conflict between vehicles and pedestrians / bicyclists at the divergence point of the jughandle ramp .
* Operations * Increased travel time and delay for left - turning motorists redirected through jughandle .
* Increased overall percentage of vehicles stopped at the intersection .
* Potential for queues along the cross street to block the exit terminal of the jughandle , increasing stops , delays , and travel time of left - turning motorists .
* With reverse jughandles , motorists travel through the intersection twice : adding to the net movement demand .
* Motorists wishing to perform a U - turn maneuver at a reverse jughandle must perform a weaving maneuver across all cross - street lanes to travel from the jughandle terminus to the left - turn lane ( unless another reverse jughandle is located on the other corner on the side of the cross street ahead of the motorist 's original direction , in which case the motorist stays on the right but must cross through the intersection three times ) .
* To provide for motorist safety , the Federal Highway Administration recommends locating transit stops further from the intersection , outside of the jughandle ramps .
This can reduce pedestrian demand due to the additional travel distance to access the transit stop .
* " Type A " standard forward jughandles can encourage drivers to try beating ( bypassing )
the stopped redlight traffic by driving into the jughandle , turning left , and then turning right onto the original roadway to proceed in the original direction of travel prior to that roadway 's light turning green again and releasing the stopped traffic .
*
Right - of - way * Additional right - of - way may be required alongside the roadway , unless the existing street network can be utilized .
