HOME RUN DERBY
The Home Run Derby is an annual home run hitting contest in Major League Baseball ( MLB )
customarily held the day before the MLB All - Star Game , which places the contest on a Monday in July .
Since the inaugural derby in 1985 , the event has seen several rule changes , evolving from a short outs - based competition , to multiple rounds , and eventually a bracket - style timed event .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The event has grown significantly from its roots in the 1980s , when it was not televised .
Prior to 1991 , the Home Run Derby was structured as a two - inning event with each player receiving five outs per inning , allowing for the possibility of ties .
It is now one of the most - watched events broadcast on ESPN .
In 2000 , a " match play"-style format was instituted for the second round .
The player with the most home runs in the first round faced the player with the least among the four qualifying players , as did the players with the second- and third - most totals .
The contestant who won each matchup advanced to the finals .
This format was discontinued after the 2003 competition .
The field of players selected currently consists of four American League players and four National League players .
The first Derby in 1985 featured five from each league , and the 1986 and 1987 events featured three and two players from each league , respectively .
In 1996 , the field was again expanded to ten players , five from each league ( though in 1997 , the AL had six contestants to the NL 's four ) .
In 2000 , the field reverted to the current four - player - per - league format .
The only exception was 2005 , when Major League Baseball changed the selection criteria with eight players representing their home countries rather than their respective leagues .
The change was believed to be in promotion of the inaugural World Baseball Classic , played in March 2006 .
In 2006 , the selection of four players from each league resumed .
In 2011 , the format was revised so that team captains selected the individual sides .
Some notable performances in the Derby include Bobby Abreu in 2005 , who won the Derby with a then - record 41 homers , including a then - record 24 in the first round .
The first - round record was broken in 2008 by Josh Hamilton , who hit 28 home runs .
Though Hamilton 's performance was notable for the length of his home runs , he ultimately lost to Justin Morneau in a brief final round .
The overall record was broken in 2016 by Giancarlo Stanton , who finished with a total of 61 home runs , defeating Todd Frazier in the final round .
Only two participants , Yoenis Céspedes and Giancarlo Stanton , have won the Home Run Derby without being selected to the All - Star game itself .
OVERVIEW FORMAT Section::::Overview .
Section::::Format .
The format has varied since the Home Run Derby started in 1985 .
1985–1990 Section::::1985–1990 .
In the early years of the Home Run Derby , 4 - 10 players from both the AL and NL were selected to participate .
Each player was given 2 " innings " to hit as many home runs as possible before reaching 5 outs .
For the derby , an out is defined as any swing that is not a home run .
The winner of the contest was the player with the most total home runs in the two innings .
1991–2005
Section::::1991–2005 .
Beginning in 1991 , the format changed to a 3-round contest .
From 1991–2006 , 8 - 10 players were selected and hit as many home runs as possible before reaching 10 outs in each round .
The tally reset for each round , with the top four advancing to the second round , and the top two advancing to the final .
In honor of the World Baseball Classic , the 2005 contest featured eight players from different countries .
The format remained the same .
2006–2013 Section::::2006–2013 .
The format changed slightly in 2006 .
Instead of the tally resetting for each round , it was only reset before the final round .
Therefore , the players with the four highest totals after Round 1 advanced to Round 2 , and the players with the two highest sum of Round 1 and 2 advanced to the finals . 2014 Section::::2014 .
The Home Run Derby format was changed significantly in 2014 , as MLB sought to speed - up the contest and increase the drama .
In the new bracket format , five players from each league faced the other players in their league in Round 1 , with each players having seven " outs . "
The player in each league with the highest Round 1 total received a second - round bye , and the players with the second- and third - highest
Round 1 totals from each league faced off .
The Round 2 winner from each league faced the Round 1 winner , and the Round 3 winner crowned the league winner .
The final featured the winner of each league .
Each round stands alone , with the score reset for each round .
Ties in any round are broken by a 3-swing swing - off .
If the players remain tied , the players engage in a sudden - death swing - off until one player homers .
SINCE 2015 Section::::Since 2015 .
The format was changed once again in 2015 .
The most significant change was the elimination of " outs " , which was replaced by a time limit .
Eight players are seeded based on their season home run totals and are given five minutes to hit as many home runs as possible .
The winner of each head - to - head matchup advances , until a final winner is determined .
If a tie occurs in any match - up , three sets of tiebreakers are employed : first , a 90-second swing - off decides the winner ; second , best - of-3-swing swing - off ; thereafter , sudden - death swingoffs until a winner is determined .
Further , a player can get " bonus time " in the last minute of each round .
During that time , the clock stops for each home run , and does n't restart until a swing does not result in a home run .
Additional bonus time could be earned for distance .
Players who hit at least two home runs measuring at least are given an extra minute of bonus time .
An additional 30 seconds of bonus time is granted if at least one home run measures over .
Weather concerns in 2015 lead to a reduction in time from five minutes per round to four minutes .
The clock was not stopped in the final minute , and bonus time was only granted for hitting two home runs of over .
The format was tweaked slightly in 2016 .
The four - minute round length returned , while the minute of bonus time was changed to 30 seconds and required two home runs of or longer .
The additional time was removed , while the swing - off ( which was not required ) was reduced to one minute .
Each batter is allowed one time - out during each round , and two in the finals .
By 2017 the first tie - breaker was restored back to 90 seconds .
GOLD BALLS Section::::Gold balls .
From 2005–2013 , a gold ball has been used once a player reaches nine outs ( in 2014 when the T - Mobile Ball came into play , six ; since 2015 , during the final minute ) .
If a batter hit a home run using the golden ball , Century 21 Real Estate and Major League Baseball would donate $ 21,000 ( a reference to the " 21 " in " Century 21 " ) per home run to charity ( MLB donated to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America , and Century 21 donated to Easter Seals ) .
In both 2005 and 2006 , $ 294,000 was raised for the charities , equaling fourteen golden ball home runs per year .
State Farm continued this in 2007 as they designated $ 17,000 per home run ( one dollar for each of State Farm 's agencies ) , to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America .
In the 2007 event , fifteen golden balls were hit for a donation of $ 255,000 , and ten ( $ 170,000 ) were hit in the 2008 event .
For 2009 , State Farm added $ 5,000 for all non - Gold Ball homers , and $ 517,000 was collected .
For 2010 , the non - Gold Ball homer was reduced to $ 3,000 per home run and a total of $ 453,000 was collected .
Since 2014 any homer hit off a T - Mobile Ball resulted in a $ 10,000 donation to charity by T - Mobile and MLB , to Team Rubicon .
TELEVISION AND RADIO COVERAGE Section::::Television and radio coverage .
On July 11 , 1988 , the day before the Major League Baseball All - Star Game from Cincinnati , TBS televised the annual All - Star Gala from the Cincinnati Zoo .
Larry King hosted the broadcast with Craig Sager and Pete Van Wieren handling interviews .
The broadcast 's big draw would 've been the Home Run Derby , which TBS intended on taping during the afternoon , and later airing it in prime time during the Gala coverage .
Unfortunately , the derby and a skills competition were canceled due to rain .
The derby was first nationally televised by ESPN in 1993 on a same - day delayed basis , with the first live telecast in 1998 .
Although two hours are scheduled in programming listings for the telecast , it has rarely ever been contained to the timeslot and consistently runs three to four hours .
Chris Berman has gained notoriety for his annual hosting duties on ESPN , including his catchphrase , " Back back back … Gone ! " .
Berman starts this phrase when the ball is hit , and does not say " Gone ! "
until the ball lands .
The 2008 Derby was the year 's most highly rated basic cable program .
Because of the game 's TV popularity , invited players have felt pressure to participate .
Notably , Ken Griffey Jr. initially quietly declined to take part in 1998 , partly due to ESPN scheduling the Mariners in their late Sunday game the night before .
After a discussion with ESPN 's Joe Morgan and another with Hall of Famer Frank Robinson , Griffey changed his mind , and then won the Derby at Coors Field .
In Spanish , the event is televised on Spanish language network ESPN Deportes .
ESPN Radio also carries the event annually .
