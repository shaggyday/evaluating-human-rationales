The brand was widely known for its successful " Ring Around The Collar " campaign introduced in 1968 , spotlighting sometimes - difficult to treat stains that appeared on shirt collars , and the product 's ability to help fight them .
The campaign received significant criticism decades later for being misogynistic , with the implication that it was the fault of wives for letting their husbands leave home with dirty collars .
