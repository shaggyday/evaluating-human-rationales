WEST END OF LONDON
The West End of London ( commonly referred to as the West End ) , refers to both a distinct and the wider region of Central London , west of the City of London and north of the River Thames , in which many of the city 's major tourist attractions , shops , businesses , government buildings and entertainment venues , including West End theatres , are concentrated .
Use of the term began in the early 19th century to describe fashionable areas to the west of Charing Cross .
The West End covers part of the boroughs of Westminster and Camden .
While the City of London , or the Square Mile , is the main business and financial district in London , the West End is the main commercial and entertainment centre of the city .
It is the largest central business district in the United Kingdom , comparable to Midtown Manhattan in New York City , Causeway Bay in Hong Kong , Shibuya in Tokyo , or the 8th arrondissement in Paris .
It is one of the most expensive locations in the world in which to rent office space .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Medieval London comprised two adjacent cities - the City of London
( cathedral : St. Paul 's ) to the east , and the City of Westminster
( cathedral : Westminster Abbey ) to the west .
Over time they came to form the centre of modern London , although each kept its own distinct character and its separate legal identity ( for example , the City of London has its own police force and is a distinct county ) .
The City of London became a centre for the banking , financial , legal and professional sectors , while Westminster became associated with the leisure , shopping , commerce , and entertainment sectors , the government , and home to universities and embassies .
The modern West End is closely associated with this area of central London .
Lying to the west of the historic Roman and medieval City of London , the West End was long favoured by the rich elite as a place of residence because it was usually upwind of the smoke drifting from the crowded City .
It was close to the royal seat of power at the Palace of Westminster ( now home to Parliament ) , and is largely contained within the City of Westminster ( one of the 32 London boroughs ) .
Developed in the 17th , 18th and 19th centuries , it was built as a series of palaces , expensive town houses , fashionable shops and places of entertainment .
The areas closest to the City around Holborn , Seven Dials , and Covent Garden contained poorer communities that were cleared and redeveloped in the 19th century .
BOUNDARIES
Section::::Boundaries .
As the West End is a term used colloquially by Londoners and is not an official geographical or municipal definition , its exact constituent parts are up for debate .
Westminster City Council 's 2005 report Vision for the West End included the following areas in its definition : Covent Garden , Soho , Chinatown , Leicester Square , the shopping streets of Oxford Street , Regent Street and Bond Street , the area encompassing Trafalgar Square , the Strand and Aldwych , and the district known as Theatreland .
The Edgware Road to the north - west and the Victoria Embankment to the south - east were also covered by the document but were treated as " adjacent areas " to the West End .
According to Ed Glinert 's West End Chronicles ( 2006 ) the districts falling within the West End are Mayfair , Soho , Covent Garden , Fitzrovia and Marylebone .
By this definition , the West End borders Temple , Holborn and Bloomsbury to the east , Regent 's Park to the north , Paddington , Hyde Park and Knightsbridge to the west , and Victoria and Westminster to the south .
Other definitions include Bloomsbury within the West End .
One of the local government wards within the City of Westminster is called " West End " .
This covers a similar area that defined by Glinert : Mayfair , Soho , and parts of Fitzrovia and Marylebone .
The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 10,575 .
ACTIVITIES Section::::Activities .
Taking a fairly broad definition of the West End , the area contains the main concentrations of most of London 's metropolitan activities apart from financial and many types of legal services , which are concentrated primarily in the City of London .
