ARGIOPE AURANTIA
The spider species Argiope aurantia is commonly known as the yellow garden spider , black and yellow garden spider , golden garden spider , writing spider , zigzag spider , corn spider , or McKinley spider .
It is common to the contiguous United States , Hawaii , southern Canada , Mexico , and Central America .
It has distinctive yellow and black markings on the abdomen and a mostly white cephalothorax .
Its scientific Latin name translates to " gilded silver - face " ( the genus name Argiope meaning " silver - face " , while the specific epithet aurantia means " gilded " ) .
Males range from ; females range from .
These spiders may bite if disturbed or harassed , but the venom is harmless to non - allergic humans , roughly equivalent to a bumblebee sting in intensity .
HABITAT Section::::Habitat .
Yellow garden spiders often build webs in areas adjacent to open sunny fields where they stay concealed and protected from the wind .
The spider can also be found along the eaves of houses and outbuildings or in any tall vegetation where they can securely stretch a web .
Female Argiope aurantia spiders tend to be somewhat local , often staying in one place throughout much of their lifetime .
The web of the yellow garden spider is distinctive : a circular shape up to 2 feet ( 60 cm ) in diameter , with a dense zigzag of silk , known as a stabilimentum , in the center .
The purpose of the stabilimentum is disputed .
It is possible that it acts as camouflage for the spider lurking in the web 's center , but it may also attract insect prey , or even warn birds of the presence of the otherwise difficult - to - see web .
Only those spiders that are active during the day construct stabilimenta in their webs .
To construct the web , several radial lines are stretched among four or five anchor points that can be more than three feet apart .
The radial lines meet at a central point .
The spider makes a frame with several more radial lines and then fills the center with a spiral of silk , leaving a gap between the spiral rings , starting with the innermost ring and moving outward in a clockwise motion .
To ensure that the web is taut , the spider bends the radial lines slightly together while applying the silk spiral .
The female builds a substantially larger web than the male 's small zigzag web , often found nearby .
The spider occupies the center of the web , usually facing straight down , waiting for prey to become ensnared in it .
If disturbed by a possible predator , she may drop from the web and hide on the ground nearby .
The web normally remains in one location for the entire summer , but spiders can change locations usually early in the season , perhaps to find better protection or better hunting .
The yellow garden spider can oscillate her web vigorously while she remains firmly attached in the center .
This action might prevent predators like wasps and birds from drawing a good bead , and also to fully entangle an insect before it cuts itself loose .
However , in a case observed in Georgia , Davis witnessed a Vespa crabro fly into the spider 's web and get tangled up .
Upon looking closer it was found that V. crabro was actually cutting free prey that had been caught in the A. aurantia web .
In this case , A. aurantia did not interfere or fight with the European hornet , probably because it dropped from the web and hid nearby .
The yellow garden spider does not live in very dense location clusters like other orb spiders such as the golden orb web spider .
The yellow garden spider keeps a clean orderly web in comparison to the cluttered series of webs built and abandoned by groups of golden orb spiders .
VENOM Section::::Venom .
Argiope spiders are not aggressive .
They might bite if grabbed , but other than for defense they do not attack large animals .
Their venom often contains a library of polyamine toxins with potential as therapeutic medicinal agents .
Notable among these is the argiotoxin ArgTX-636 .
A bite by Argiope aurantia is comparable to a bee sting with redness and swelling .
For a healthy adult , a bite is not considered an issue .
Though they are not aggressive spiders , the very young , elderly , and those with compromised immune systems should exercise caution , just as they would around a beehive .
REPRODUCTION
Section::::Reproduction .
Yellow garden spiders breed twice a year .
The males roam in search of a female , building a small web near or actually in the female 's web , then court the females by plucking strands on her web .
Often , when the male approaches the female , he has a safety drop line ready , in case she attacks him .
The male uses the palpal bulbs on his pedipalps to transfer sperm to the female .
After inserting the second palpal bulb , the male dies , and is sometimes then eaten by the female .
She lays her eggs at night on a sheet of silky material , then covers them with another layer of silk , then a protective brownish silk .
She then uses her legs to form the sheet into a ball with an upturned neck .
Egg sacs range from 5/8 " to 1 " in diameter .
She often suspends the egg sac right on her web , near the center where she spends most of her time .
Each spider produces from one to four sacs with perhaps over a thousand eggs inside each .
She guards the eggs against predation as long as she is able .
However , as the weather cools , she becomes more frail , and dies around the time of the first hard frost .
In the spring , the young spiders exit the sac .
They are so tiny that they look like dust gathered inside the silk mesh .
Some of the spiderlings remain nearby , but others exude a strand of silk that gets caught by the breeze , carrying the spiderling to a more distant area .
EATING HABITS Section::::Eating habits .
Females of the species are the most commonly seen in gardens .
Their webs are usually characterized by a zigzag shaped stabilimentum ( an extra thick line of silk ) in the middle extending vertically .
The spiders spend most of their time in their webs , waiting for prey to become ensnared .
When prey becomes caught in the web , the spider may undulate the web back and forth to further trap the insect .
When the prey is secure , the spider kills it by injecting its venom and then wraps the prey in a cocoon of silk for later consumption ( typically 1â€“4 hours later ) .
Prey includes small vertebrates , such as geckos and green anoles , as well as insects .
