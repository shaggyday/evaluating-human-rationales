TELEVISION LICENSING IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND
In Ireland , a television licence is required for any address at which there is a television set .
Since 2016 , the annual licence fee is € 160 .
Revenue is collected by An Post , the Irish postal service .
The bulk of the fee is used to fund Raidió Teilifís Éireann ( RTÉ ) , the state broadcaster .
The licence must be paid for any premises that has any equipment that can potentially decode TV signals , even those that are not RTÉ 's .
The licence is free to anyone over the age of 70 , some over 66 , some Social Welfare recipients , and the blind .
The fee for the licences of such beneficiaries is paid for by the state .
The current governing legislation is the Broadcasting Act 2009 , in particular Part 9 " Television Licence " and Chapter 5 " Allocation of Public Funding to RTÉ and TG4 " .
Devices which stream television via internet do not need licenses , nor do small portable devices such as mobile phones .
The 2011–16 government planned to replace the television licence with a Public Service Broadcasting Charge on all primary residences and certain businesses .
A public consultation document on the plan was published in August 2013 .
Asked in December 2014 about the delay in switching from the licence to the new charge ,
Minister of State Joe McHugh said the government would " be taking more time to work out a very complex system " .
Implementation of the broadcasting charge was postponed in 2015 but returned to the political agenda in 2017 .
COLLECTION AND EVASION Section::::Collection and evasion .
An Post is responsible for collection of the licence fee and commencement of prosecution proceedings in cases of non - payment .
Licences can be purchased and renewed at post offices ( in person or by post ) , or by using a credit card or debit card via a call centre or via the internet .
An Post receives commission to cover the cost of its collection service .
In 2004 , An Post had signalled its intention to withdraw from the business , but was still the agent in 2017 .
In 2012 , 10.25 % of licensees paid by direct debit and 11.5 % using savings stamps .
The Broadcasting ( Amendment ) Bill 2017 proposes to allow public tender for additional collection agents , who would not have prosecution powers .
A 2017 Oireachtas committee report recommends transferred responsibility for collection to the Revenue Commissioners .
An Post maintains a database of addresses and uses this to inspect suspected cases of non - payment .
Television dealers are required to supply details of people buying or renting televisions ; this is no longer enforced as details supplied were unreliable .
There is no obligation on cable and satellite providers to supply details of subscribers ; in November 2012 , a bill to change this was introduced .
Communications minister Pat Rabbitte announced a planned government bill to the same effect in July 2014 .
In April 2015 , the proposal was to allow An Post to access cable and satellite subscriber databases , in tandem with cost - cutting at RTÉ ; in October 2015 it was reported that the plan had been shelved .
Inspectors , who are An Post employees , visit the premises to verify if TV receiving equipment is present .
If speedy payment of the licence is not made following an inspection , court proceedings are commenced by An Post .
In 2002 , the rate of licence - fee evasion was estimated at 12 % .
In the Dublin region in that year , approximately 21 % of detected evaders were summonsed for prosecution ( 6,000 cases ) ; approximately one third of these cases resulted in fines , averaging € 174 .
Only 4 % of fined evaders followed up three months later had purchased a licence .
In 2012 , there were 11,500 prosecutions , up 10 % over 2011 .
Of those convicted , 242 were sent to jail , most for a few hours , six overnight .
This compared with 49 jailed in 2008 .
In 2010 , the Secretary General of the Department of Communications , Energy and Natural Resources told the Oireachtas Public Accounts Committee that the evasion rate was estimated at 12 % , and the renewed contract with An Post would include provision for a 1 percentage point annual decrease in this .
In September 2016 the evasion rate was estimated at 13.75 % , representing approximately € 40 m annual lost revenue .
DISBURSEMENT Section::::Disbursement .
TV licence fees make up 50 % of the income of RTÉ .
The bulk of the rest comes from RTÉ broadcasting commercials on its radio and TV stations .
RTÉ also sells programming to other broadcasting .
Some RTÉ services , such as RTÉ 2fm , RTÉ Aertel , rte.ie , and the transmission network operate on an entirely commercial basis .
The licence fee does not entirely go to RTÉ .
Expenses first deducted include the cost of collection ( paid to An Post ) .
7 % of the balance is used for the BAI 's " Sound and Vision Scheme " , which provides a fund for programme production and restoration of archive material which is open to applications from any quarter .
TG4 does not obtain licence fee revenue directly , but does so indirectly as RTÉ is required to provide it with one hour 's programming per day , as well as other technical support .
RTÉ 's accounts express the cost of this as a percentage of its licence fee income , amounting to 5.3 % in 2006 .
The remainder of TG4 's funding is direct state grants and commercial income .
The 2009 McCarthy Report , commissioned in response to a growing economic crisis , recommended that € 10 m of TG4 's funding should in future come from licence fee revenue ; without increasing the fee , this would entail a matching reduction in RTÉ 's funding .
This reduction is included in the government budget introduced in December 2010 .
A 2017 Oireachtas committee report recommended that any increase in revenue from reduction in fee evasion should be allocated to TG4 and independent broadcasters providing public - service programming .
The RTÉ Authority was replaced by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland which regulates both private and public broadcasters .
It is not directly funded from the licence fee ; RTÉ , however , in common with other broadcasters , pays a levy to the Authority for its services .
CRITICISM Section::::Criticism .
The licence has been criticised both in principle and as regards its implementation .
It is opposed for being outdated in a world with an increasing variety of TV channels and audio - visual technologies .
Commercial television companies have alleged that RTÉ unfairly uses licence fee to outbid them for broadcast rights to foreign films , TV series , and sports events .
RTÉ denies this .
European Community competition law prevents state funding of commercial activity , and RTÉ 's accounts charge for non-"public service " programming out of its commercial income rather than its licence fee subsidy .
The licence is condemned as a regressive tax , where the majority of prosecutions are of people on low incomes .
The high cost of collection is presented as inefficient .
Licence inspectors ' calling to people 's doors is seen as intrusive .
The low rate of prosecution of non - payers is seen as allowing evaders a " free ride " .
The lack of an exemption ( as exists in the UK ) for those who can prove they do n't use their equipment to receive RTÉ ( or any TV ) is regarded as unfair .
Alternative funding methods suggested include direct funding from general exchequer revenues , or a levy on electricity bills on the model of Cyprus .
A licence is required per address , rather than per person or per set .
It has been considered unfair that the same licence fee applies to a single private dwelling as to a large commercial address , such as a hotel or a privately owned business park .
In 2003 , there was negative comment after a crackdown on unlicensed television sets at holiday homes , and proposals for a reduced - rate licence for seldom - occupied premises .
RTÉ journalists largely support the existence of the licence , and lobby for greater increases in the fee , as being a revenue stream independent of the government and thus guaranteeing freedom from political influence and associated editorial bias .
The opposite claim has also been made : that an annual review of the licence fee by the Government leaves RTÉ liable to political pressure .
A survey of public attitudes to public - sector broadcasting was carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute in 2004 .
The authors noted that " public discontent at the level and inherently regressive nature of the ad rem licence fee is noticeable by its absence , particularly in contrast to the difficulties associated with the introduction of some ad rem service charges , e.g. bin and water charges .
" The associated opinion poll recorded agree : disagree percentages of 54:29 for the statement " Public Broadcasting should be financed by the licence fee .
" Respondents were asked what level of monthly fee they would be prepared to pay to receive RTÉ if subscription access were hypothetically to replace the licence fee : the annualised mean and median household figures were € 180 and € 252.60 , compared to the then licence fee of € 150 , with those who frequently watched RTÉ programs most willing to pay .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Television licences were introduced for the establishment of Telefís Éireann ( now RTÉ ) in 1962 .
Radio licences , abolished in 1972 , had been introduced by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1904 prior to the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922 .
Non - compliance was widespread until the Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1926 when the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was empowered to prosecute those with no licence .
Although before 1962 there was no television licence as such , a television set fell under the definition of " wireless receiver " ;
thus someone possessing a television but no radio would have needed a wireless licence at the same fee as someone with a radio .
Conversely between 1962 and 1972 , the possessor of a television licence did not need an additional radio licence .
In 1975 , members of Conradh na Gaeilge , an Irish language activist group , began campaigning for an Irish - language television station .
They adopted tactics learnt from Welsh language activists of Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg , including non - payment of the television licence , and non - payment of fines imposed for not having a licence .
Between 1973 and 1993 , a total of 15 people were imprisoned for terms of between 2 and 14 days for non - payment of the licence fee and associated fine .
Among them were Alan Heusaff and Seán Mac Stíofáin .
This campaign of civil disobedience ended in 1996 with the establishment of Telefís na Gaeilge ( now TG4 ) .
Century Radio , Ireland 's first licensed national solely private - sector broadcaster , began broadcasting in 1990 .
Minister Ray Burke proposed allocating 25 % of the television licence revenues to private - sector broadcasters .
The government rejected this , but agreed instead to cap RTÉ 's advertising income .
A tribunal of enquiry later established that Oliver Barry , an investor in Century Radio , had given Burke a political donation of £ 30,000 .
The advertising cap was lifted in 1993 .
In the mid-1990s , proposals were floated to distribute funding ( licence fee income or otherwise ) among broadcasters based on content production , on the model of New Zealand .
RTÉ successfully persuaded minister Michael D. Higgins against such a change ; although the Sound & Vision scheme now operated effectively provides this , at a low level .
RTÉ provide 7 % ( increased from 5 % in 2009 ) of the licence fee to the Sound and Vision fund which is managed by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland ( BAI ) .
RTÉ are required by law to commission independent productions with at least 20 % of their total licence and 365 hours of programming a year to TG4 .
MEDIA CONVERGENCE Section::::Media convergence .
The definition of television in the original licensing legislation presumed a wireless radio broadcast receiver , and it was unclear whether it extended to computers , internet devices , 3 G mobile phones , or other newer technologies .
In April 2007 , then Minister for Communications , Energy and Natural Resources Noel Dempsey proposed modernising the definition to include newer technologies
The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications , Marine and Natural Resources cautioned against too broad a definition :
In 2009 , a ministerial order under the 2009 Act explicitly exempted two classes of device from the requirement to have a licence ; namely , portable devices with small screens such as 3 G phones or PDAs , and devices accessing streaming video services via the internet .
However , computers with TV tuner cards are not exempt .
The 2009 Act also provides for on - the - spot fines and civil suits to be used against those not having a television licence , in response to negative views of the previous use of criminal proceedings , including imprisonment .
The programme agreed by the Fine Gael – Labour coalition government formed after the 2011 general election states :
In January 2012 , minister Pat Rabbitte told the Dáil the existing licence model was inadequate both because it failed to take account of new media and because the evasion rate was 15 % .
He said his department was studying funding methods of several foreign countries , and was considering using the database being established for the household charge to collect the broadcasting charge .
The department commissioned a value - for - money report , completed in April 2013 , which found that evasion of the licence fee was increasing and that " the most serious threat to the future effectiveness of the current system is likely to arise from the capacity and convergence of new technology " .
Based on the report , the department drafted a consultation document on a proposed new " Public Service Broadcasting Charge " which was published on 27 August 2013 .
In April 2015 , Rabbitte 's successor as minister , Alex White , said " we can not replace the TV licence fee with a public service broadcasting charge until we have built public understanding and support for such a move " .
A September 2015 report by Kevin Rafter for the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland concluded that " Changing viewing habits will continue to undermine the licence fee model . "
In November 2017 , an Oireachtas committee report recommended a " non - device dependent public service broadcasting charge " per household , to fund " authoritative , impartial , indigenous , trusted and reputable public service media in Ireland " .
LICENCE FEE Section::::Licence fee .
Increases in the licence fee have been irregular .
Only one happened between 1986 and 2001 .
Later increases were essentially index - linked , with none since the Irish financial crisis which began in 2008 .
Section 124 of the 2009 Act enshrines index - linking in law , although only as a recommendation .
RTÉ in 2017 suggested an immdiate increase to € 175 to backdate annual increases forgone since 2009 .
A 2017 Oireachtas committee recommended a review every two years based on a pure CPI formula .
The annual fee is set by a statutory instrument ( SI ) which remains in force until superseded by a later SI .
