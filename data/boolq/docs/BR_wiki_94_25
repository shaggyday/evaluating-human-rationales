SHOTGUNNING Shotgunning is a means of consuming a beverage , commonly beer , very quickly by punching a hole in the side of the can , near the bottom , placing the mouth over the hole , and pulling the tab to open the top .
The beer quickly drains , and is quickly consumed .
A related technique , strawpedoing , is used for containers not easily punctured such as a glass bottles .
A straw is inserted into the bottle and bent around the hole .
When the bottle is tilted , the beverage quickly drains and quickly consumed .
The technique increases beverage delivery since the extra hole allows the liquid to leave while air enters simultaneously through the main hole .
The bottleneck , created where air entering the container must travel through the same orifice as liquid leaving , is removed .
Both of these are normally done as a competition .
The participants wait until all the others are ready until the countdown begins .
Once the countdown is finished , the participants get under way and the first one to finish consuming the beverage is the winner .
TECHNIQUE Section::::Technique .
To shotgun a beverage , a small hole is punched in the side of the can , close to the bottom .
In order to prevent the liquid from spilling out while the cut is made , the can is held horizontally and the hole is made in the resulting air pocket .
The hole can be made with any sharp object â€” typically a key , bottle opener , pen or knife .
The drinker then places their mouth over the hole while rotating the can straight up .
When the can 's tab is pulled , the liquid will quickly drain through the hole into the drinker 's mouth .
