ARKANSAS RAZORBACKS
The Arkansas Razorbacks , also known as the Hogs , are the mascots of college sports teams at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville , Arkansas .
The University of Arkansas student body voted to change the name of the school mascot ( originally the Cardinals ) in 1910 to the Arkansas Razorbacks after a hard fought battle against LSU in which they were said to play like a " wild band of Razorback hogs " by former coach Hugo Bezdek .
The Arkansas Razorbacks are the only major sports team in the US with a porcine nickname , though the Texas A&M – Kingsville Javelinas play in Division II .
The University of Arkansas currently fields 19 total varsity teams ( eight men 's and 11 women 's ) in 13 sports , and competes in the NCAA Division
I ( I FBS in football ) and is currently a member of the Southeastern Conference ( Western Division ) .
HISTORY Section::::History .
After classes were first held at the university , a contest was held on campus to select school colors .
Cardinal ( a shade of deep red ) was selected over heliotrope , a shade of moderate purple .
The first Arkansas football team was formed that same year and was known as the " Arkansas Cardinals " .
Sometime around the year 2000 , the color black began making its way onto Razorback merchandise and eventually some team uniforms .
Indeed , for some time , the Collegiate Licensing Company ( responsible for all UA licensed gear ) touted the university 's colors as red and black instead of cardinal red and white .
While this has been corrected , many manufacturers of UA related merchandise still make product according to the red and black color scheme .
Arkansas merchandise sold at the highest levels in school history during the 2012–13 academic year when royalties through CLC ranked 10th best in the nation .
In 1909 , the football team finished a 7–0 season , allowing only 18 points on defense and scoring 186 points on offense .
College Football Hall of Fame coach Hugo Bezdek proclaimed his team played " like a wild band of razorback hogs " .
The name proved so popular that it was changed for the 1910 season .
The tradition of calling the hogs , " Woo , Pig ! Sooie " was added in the 1920s .
In 1957 , Frank Broyles was hired as the head football coach and served in that position for 19 years .
Broyles ' team was awarded the 1964 National Championship by the Football Writers Association of America and the Helms Athletic Foundation .
At the time , The AP and UPI both awarded the designation before bowl games , and gave the award to Alabama .
However , Alabama lost their bowl game to Texas , while Arkansas won theirs against Nebraska .
The FWAA and HAF both awarded their national championship designations to Arkansas , who was the only team to go undefeated through bowl games that year .
Both the University of Arkansas and the University of Alabama claimed national championships for the year 1964 .
In 1969 , Broyles ' team was ranked # 2 and played the # 1-ranked Texas Longhorns , coached by Darrell Royal , in Fayetteville .
The game , known as " The Big Shootout " is perhaps the most notable football game in Razorback history .
President Richard Nixon was even in attendance .
The Razorbacks led 14–0 until the 4th quarter .
Texas scored 15 unanswered points and won the national championship 15–14 .
After Broyles left coaching and became Athletic Director , he hired Lou Holtz to take over his former position .
Holtz served as the head football coach from 1977 through the 1983 season .
Under him , the Razorbacks lost a national championship in the Sugar Bowl against Alabama and beat the Oklahoma Sooners in the Orange Bowl , ending their national championship hopes .
On 1971 , the women 's athletic department was formed .
On January 1 , 2008 , the men 's and women 's athletic departments merged along with a new athletic director .
The basketball team rose to prominence in the 1970s now under the coaching of Eddie Sutton and with future NBA star Sidney Moncrief along with Marvin Delph and Ron Brewer , three similarly - sized Arkansas bred guards , known as " The Triplets " .
The team made a Final Four appearance under him , finishing 3rd by defeating Notre Dame on a last second shot in the now defunct consolation game .
In the 1980s , the football team was now coached by Ken Hatfield , and established itself as a powerful running team .
The Razorbacks challenged for the SWC title each year and went to the Cotton Bowl Classic twice .
Hatfield 's teams established excellent regular season records , but had difficulty winning bowl games .
In 1990 , Broyles led the Razorbacks out of the Southwest Conference and into the Southeastern Conference , setting off a major realignment in college football .
In 1995 , the Arkansas Razorbacks won its first SEC Western Division Title in football .
In 1994 , Nolan Richardson 's basketball Razorbacks won the NCAA Tournament .
His basketball teams challenged for the SEC and national championships regularly during the 1990s , making three trips to the Final Four and two to the championship game while compiling a record of 389–169 ( .697 ) in his 17 years as the head basketball coach .
On December 10 , 1997 , Houston Nutt was hired as head football coach for the Razorbacks ( 1998 season was his first full season ) to replace Danny Ford , who had been head coach since 1993 , and the 1998 season was his first full season .
Highly sought after as a Little Rock Central quarterback , Nutt had been the last recruit to sign under Broyles , but transferred to Oklahoma State University once when he did not fit Holtz 's offensive plans .
Soon after Houston Dale Nutt 's timely departure , Razorback fans rejoiced as Atlanta Falcons Coach Bobby Petrino called the team .
He led the team to a BCS game in 2010 and the school 's third 11 win season with a Top 5 season ranking in the 2011 season with a heavy passing attack .
On April 1 , 2012 Bobby Petrino drove his motorcycle into a ditch with a passenger aboard .
He was fired after it was revealed this passenger was his mistress whom he had hired onto his staff .
AD Jeff Long introduced John L. Smith as the interim coach for the 2012 season in late April .
Smith entered the season as the steward of a pre - season Top 10 squad with multiple pre - season Heisman hopefuls .
He recorded the school 's first loss to a Sunbelt team in the program 's 100-year history as Louisiana Monroe pulled the upset in Little Rock .
In only his second game , he had managed the second largest drop from the AP ranking narrowly missing the # 1 spot held by Michigan after losing the season opener to Appalachian State just threes years before .
On December 4 , 2012 , the school named former University of Wisconsin coach Bret Bielema as head coach for the 2013 season .
Coach Bielema rebuilt the team around a power running game and strong defense and led the team back to a winning record in 2014 including back - to - back shutouts over top ten teams , the first time in history such a feat had been accomplished , and a victory over Texas in the Texas bowl at the end of the season .

Inside the state of Arkansas , the University of Arkansas has continued to maintain the policy of not competing against other in - state Division I schools .
There are four other Division I schools in the state of Arkansas :
Arkansas State University in Jonesboro , the University of Arkansas at Little Rock ( athletically branded as " Little Rock " ) , University of Arkansas - Pine Bluff , and the University of Central Arkansas in Conway .
ASU is the only school of the three to compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision ; Little Rock does not have football , while UAPB and UCA compete in the Football Championship Subdivision .
Historically , Arkansas ' most heated rivalry was with the Longhorns of the University of Texas .
However , the rivalry has become much less intense since the two teams joined different conferences in the early 1990s and now meet up infrequently .
Texas leads the series in football and baseball , while Arkansas holds the series lead in basketball and track & field .
Another rival from the state of Texas is
Texas A&M. During their Southwest Conference rivalry days , the two teams played annually in all sports .
In 2009 , the rivalry resumed again on an annual basis , being played each year at Cowboys Stadium .
( see Arkansas – Texas A&M rivalry )
The rivalry in all other sports resumed in the fall of 2012 after A&M joined the SEC .
Since joining the Southeastern Conference the Razorbacks have developed a rivalry with Louisiana State University ( LSU Tigers ) in football .
The game between these two teams usually takes place near the end of the season and has sometimes decided the SEC Western Division Championship .
The winner of this game takes home the " Golden Boot " which is a gold trophy in the shape of the two states .
Arkansas took the Golden Boot home in 2007 with a 50–48 win over the # 1 ranked Tigers in Baton Rouge .
This was their first time winning the trophy since 2002 .
Arkansas and LSU have also built a rivalry in baseball , as the two schools have been at the top of the NCAA attendance standings for the past several seasons .
In 2001 , despite coming into the series in last place in the SEC West , Arkansas swept a three - game series from top - ranked LSU , which won the 2000 College World Series , in Fayetteville .
In basketball , the primary rival for the Razorbacks in the SEC are the Wildcats of the University of Kentucky .
This rivalry developed in the 1990s during the coaching tenures of Rick Pitino at Kentucky and Nolan Richardson at Arkansas when both Kentucky and Arkansas were annually in competition for a national title .
MASCOTS Section::::Mascots .
The live mascot for the University of Arkansas is named Tusk .
He is a Russian boar that weighs in at approximately 400 pounds .
Tusk currently resides on the Stokes family farm in Dardanelle , Ark. , and makes a two - hour trek up to Northwest Arkansas for every Razorback football game .
The currently mascot , Tusk IV , is a direct descendant of
Tusk I. The live mascot program at Arkansas is supported by the Tusk Fund , which is administered by the Razorback Foundation .
There are a number of costumed mascots for the University of Arkansas Razorbacks that attend most major sporting events .
Big Red ( aka the " Fighting Razorback " ) is the traditional mascot for the university and represents the intimidating fighting spirit of the Razorbacks at all athletic events .
Sue E. , is the female hog and is famous for her costume changes and dancing ability .
Pork Chop is the " kid " mascot .
Boss Hog , a nine - foot inflatable mascot , joined the mascot family during the 1998–99 football season .
The Razorback was officially adopted as the university 's mascot in 1909 after Hugo Bezdek , the coach at the time , stated after a big win that his team played like a " wild band of razorback hogs " .
Subsequently , the razorback became the mascot for the entire university , replacing the cardinals as the official mascot .
The only current athletic logo for the university is the classic or running hog as has been depicted on the program 's football helmets .
The university has ceased manufacture of memorabilia with any of the other logos in an attempt to re - brand the athletic department .
