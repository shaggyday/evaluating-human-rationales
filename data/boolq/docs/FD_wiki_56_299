POLYGAMY IN NORTH AMERICA Polygamy is the practice of taking more than one spouse .
Polygyny is the specific practice of one man taking more than one wife : it is a common marriage pattern in some parts of the world .
In North America polygamy has not been a culturally normative or legally recognized institution since the continent 's colonization by Europeans .
Polygamy became a significant social and political issue in the United States in 1852 , when The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ( LDS Church ) made it known that a form of the practice , called plural marriage , was part of its doctrine .
Opposition to the practice by the United States government resulted in an intense legal conflict , and culminated in LDS Church president Wilford Woodruff announcing the church 's official abandonment of the practice on September 25 , 1890 .
However , breakaway Mormon fundamentalist groups living mostly in the western United States , Canada , and Mexico still practice plural marriage .
Some other Americans practice polygamy including Muslims communities .
POLYGAMY DEFINED Section::::Polygamy defined .
Polygamy is defined as the practice or condition of having more than one spouse at the same time , conventionally referring to a situation where all spouses know about each other , in contrast to bigamy , where two or more spouses are usually unaware of each other .
LEGALITY OF POLYGAMY IN NORTH AMERICA UNITED STATES Section::::Legality of polygamy in North America .
Section::::United States .
Polygamy is the act or condition of a person marrying another person while still being lawfully married to another spouse .
As this is the very definition of bigamy , it is illegal in the United States .
The crime is punishable by a fine , imprisonment , or both , according to the law of the individual state and the circumstances of the offense .
Polygamy was outlawed federally by the Edmunds Act , and there are laws against the practice in all 50 states , as well as the District of Columbia , Guam , and Puerto Rico .
Because state laws exist , polygamy is not actively prosecuted at the federal level , but the practice is considered " against public policy " and , accordingly , the U.S. government wo n't recognize bigamous marriages for immigration purposes ( that is , would not allow one of the spouses to petition for immigration benefits for the other ) , even if they are legal in the country where bigamous marriage was celebrated .
Any immigrant who is coming to the United States to practice polygamy is inadmissible .
Many US courts ( e.g. Turner v. S. , 212 Miss. 590 , 55 So.2d 228 ) treat bigamy as a strict liability crime : in some jurisdictions , a person can be convicted of a felony even if he reasonably believed he had only one legal spouse .
For example , if a person has the mistaken belief that their previous spouse is dead or that their divorce is final , they can still be convicted of bigamy if they marry a new person .
CANADA Section::::Canada .
In Canada the federal Criminal Code applies throughout the country .
It extends the normal definition of polygamy to having any kind of conjugal union with more than one person at the same time .
Also anyone who assists , celebrates , or is a part to a rite , ceremony , or contract that sanctions a polygamist relationship is guilty of polygamy .
Polygamy is an offence punishable by up to five years in prison .
HISTORY OF POLYGAMY Section::::History of polygamy .
Scots - Irish settlers , and some Welsh emigrants , carried long - standing multiple partner traditions to the Americas from Europe .
Utopian and communal groups established during the mid-19th century had varying marriage systems , including group marriage and polygyny .
There is also some evidence in the American South for multiple marriage partners , particularly after the Civil War .
Polygamy has also been practiced , discreetly , by some Muslims living in America .
However , these polygamous marriages are not recognized by American law .
Because polygamy has been illegal throughout the United States since the mid-19th century , and in many individual states before that , sources on alternative marriage practices are limited .
Consequently , it is difficult to get a clear picture of the extent of the practice in the past and at the present time .
EARLY LATTER DAY SAINT PRACTICE
Section::::Early Latter Day Saint practice .
Mormon practice of plural marriage was officially introduced by Joseph Smith , the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement , on July 12 , 1843 .
As polygamy was illegal in the state of Illinois , it was practiced secretly during Smith 's lifetime .
During the 1839â€“44 Nauvoo era , several Mormon leaders ( including Smith , Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball ) took plural wives , any Mormon leaders that publicly taught polygamous doctrine were disciplined .
For example , Hyram Brown was excommunicated on February 1 , 1844 .
In May 1844 Smith declared , " What a thing it is for a man to be accused of committing adultery , and having seven wives , when I can only find one . "
After the death of Joseph Smith , the practice of polygamy continued with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ( LDS Church ) , then led by Brigham Young .
In the territory that became Utah , and some surrounding areas , plural marriage was openly practiced by LDS Church adherents .
In 1852 , Young felt the LDS Church in Utah was secure enough to publicly announce their practice of polygamy .
However opposition from the U.S. government threatened the legal standing of the LDS Church .
President Wilford Woodruff announced the LDS Church 's official abandonment of the practice on September 25 , 1890 .
Woodruff 's declaration was formally accepted in an LDS Church general conference on October 6 , 1890 .
The LDS Church 's position on the practice of polygamy was reinforced by another formal statement in 1904 called the Second Manifesto , which again renounced polygamy .
Although the Second Manifesto ended the official practice of new plural marriages , existing plural marriages were not automatically dissolved .
Many Mormons , including prominent LDS Church leaders , maintained existing plural marriages well into the 20th century .
A small percentage of adherents rejected the change , identifying as Mormon fundamentalists and leaving the mainstream LDS Church to continue practicing plural marriage .
LATTER DAY
SAINT FUNDAMENTALISM Section::::Latter Day Saint fundamentalism .
Some sects that practice or at least sanction polygamy are the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints ( FLDS ) , the Latter - day Church of Christ and the Apostolic United Brethren .
Polygamy among these groups persists today in Utah , Arizona , Colorado , Canada , and some neighboring states , as well as up to 15,000 isolated individuals with no organized church affiliation .
Polygamist churches of Latter Day Saint origin are often referred to as " Mormon fundamentalist " ; however , the main LDS Church has rejected polygamy since the early 20th century .
Mormon fundamentalists often use an ambiguous September 27 , 1886 revelation to John Taylor as the basis for continuing the practice of plural marriage .
The Salt Lake Tribune estimates there may be as many as 37,000 Mormon fundamentalists , with less than half living in polygamous households .
Most polygamous groups are composed of about a dozen extended Mormon fundamentalist organizations .
The LDS Church asserts it is improper to call any of these splinter polygamous groups " Mormon . "
CURRENT POLYGAMIST GROUPS Section::::Current polygamist groups .
Members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints
( FLDS ) practice polygamy in [ [ arranged marriages ] ]
that often , but not always , place young girls with older men .
Most FLDS members live in [ [ Hildale , Utah ] ]
and [ [ Colorado City , Arizona ] ] , about 350 miles southwest of Salt Lake City , with other communities in Canada , Texas and other areas of the North American west .
The FLDS leader is currently [ [ Warren Jeffs ] ] .
In 1998 , about 40,000 people living in Utah were part of a polygamist family , or about 1.4 percent of the population .
Polygamists have been difficult to prosecute because many only seek [ [ marriage licenses ] ] for their first marriage , while the other marriages are secretly conducted in private ceremonies .
Thereafter , secondary wives attempt to be seen in public as single women with children .
MULTIPLE DIVORCE AND MARRIAGE FOR POLYGAMY Section::::Multiple divorce and marriage for polygamy .
Some polygamous families use a system of multiple divorce and legal marriage as a [ [ loophole ] ]
in order to avoid committing a criminal act .
In such cases the husband marries the first wife , she takes his last name , he divorces her and then marries the next wife , who takes his name .
This is repeated until he has married and divorced all his wives , except possibly the last one .
This way the wives feel justified in calling themselves Mrs [ husband 's last name ] and , while legally they are divorced from the husband , they still act as if married to him and expect those around them to acknowledge and respect this .
Since only one wife is officially married to the husband at any one time , no law is being broken and so this type of polygamous family unit can be overt about their relationship .
The conviction of [ [ Thomas Arthur Green ] ]
in 2001 may have made the legal status of such relationships more precarious in Utah , although Green 's bigamy convictions were made possible only by his own public statements .
POLYGAMY TODAY
Section::::Polygamy today .
Mormon fundamentalist sects tend to aggregate in individual communities of their own specific sect and basis for polygamy .
These small groups range from a few hundred up to 10,000 , and are located across Western North America , including : * [ [ Bountiful , British Columbia ] ]
*
[ [ Pringle , South Dakota ] ] * [ [ Ozumba ] ] , [ [ State of Mexico ] ]
* [ [ Centennial Park , Arizona ] ]
*
[ [ Colorado City , Arizona ] ]

RECENT POLYGAMY CASES Section::::Recent polygamy cases .
The practice of informal polygamy among fundamentalist groups presents interesting legal issues .
It has been considered difficult to prosecute polygamists for [ [ bigamy ] ] , in large part because they are rarely formally married under state laws .
Without evidence that suspected offenders have multiple formal or [ [ common - law marriage]]s , these groups are merely subject to the laws against [ [ adultery ] ] or unlawful [ [ cohabitation ] ] â€” laws which are not commonly enforced because they also criminalize other behavior that is otherwise socially sanctioned .
However , some " Fundamentalist " polygamists marry women prior to the [ [ age of consent ] ] , or commit fraud to obtain [ [ Welfare ( financial aid)welfare ] ] and other public assistance .
In 1953 , the state of [ [ Short Creek raidArizona investigated and raided ] ]
a group of 385 people in the polygamist - practicing colony of Hildale and Colorado City , straddling the Utah - Arizona border .
All the men were arrested and the children were placed with foster families .
A judge eventually ruled this action illegal , and everyone returned to the community , which now contains about 10,000 people .
In 2001 , in the state of [ [ Utah ] ] in the [ [ United States ] ] , Juab County Attorney [ [ David O. Leavitt ] ] successfully prosecuted [ [ Thomas Arthur GreenThomas Green ] ] , who was convicted of [ [ Child support in the United Statescriminal non - support ] ] and four counts of bigamy for having five serially monogamous marriages , while living with previous legally divorced wives .
His cohabitation was considered evidence of a common - law marriage to the wives he had divorced while still living with them .
That premise was subsequently affirmed by the Utah Supreme Court in State v. Green , as applicable only in the State of Utah .
Green was also convicted of [ [ child rape ] ] and criminal non - support .
In 2005 , the state attorneys - general of [ [ Utah ] ] and [ [ Arizona ] ] issued a primer on helping victims of domestic violence and child abuse in polygamous communities .
It was subsequently updated four times , the latest in 2011 .
Enforcement of crimes such as [ [ child abuse ] ] , [ [ domestic violence ] ] , and [ [ fraud ] ] were emphasized over the enforcement of anti - polygamy and bigamy laws .
The priorities of local prosecutors are not covered by this statement .
In 2008 , starting on April 4 , Texas State officials took 436 women and children into temporary legal custody after Rozita Swinton , a 33-year - old woman living in Colorado Springs , Colorado , called both Texas Social Services and a local shelter claiming to be a 16-year - old girl .
She made a series of phone calls to authorities in late March , claiming she had been beaten and forced to become a " spiritual " wife to an adult man .
Acting on her calls , authorities raided the ranch in Eldorado , about 40 miles south of San Angelo .
The [ [ YFZ Ranch ] ] is owned by the [ [ Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ] ]
( FLDS ) , a Mormon offshoot that practices polygamy .
Two men were arrested for obstructing the raid but were later released .
Several men were found guilty and convicted of sexual assault , rape , and bigamy involving underage girls .
The stars of the TLC show [ [ Sister Wives ] ] challenged the state of Utah 's bigamy laws , though also acknowledging that the state 's constitutional ban of plural marriage licenses would remain regardless of the lawsuit 's outcome .
On December 13 , 2013 , [ [ United States federal judgeUS Federal Judge ] ]
[ [ Clark Waddoups ] ] ruled in [ [ Brown v. Buhman ] ] that the portions of Utah 's anti - polygamy laws which prohibit multiple [ [ cohabitation ] ] were unconstitutional , but also allowed Utah to maintain its ban on multiple marriage licenses .
Unlawful cohabitation , where prosecutors did not need to prove that a marriage ceremony had taken place ( only that a couple had lived together ) , had been a major tool used to prosecute polygamy in Utah since the 1882 [ [ Edmunds Act ] ] .
The [ [ United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ] ]
reversed sister wives decision in April 11 , 2016
On January 23 , 2017 , the [ [ Supreme Court of the United States ] ] declined to hear arguments from the husband and four wives who star in the television show " Sister Wives , " letting stand a lower court ruling that kept polygamy a crime in Utah .
CANADA Section::::Canada .
In Canada , polygamy is a criminal offence under section 293 of the [ [ Criminal Code ( Canada)Criminal Code ] ] , which provides for a penalty of up to five years imprisonment , but prosecutions are rare .
As of January 2009 , no person had been prosecuted for polygamy in Canada in over sixty years .
This changed in 2014 , when polygamy charges were brought against [ [ Winston Blackmore ] ] and [ [ James Oler ] ] .
Edith Barlow , a mother of five in the polygamous community of [ [ Bountiful , British ColumbiaBountiful ] ] , B.C. , was denied permanent residence and was asked to leave the country after ten years in Canada .
ALBERTA Section::::Alberta .
A 2005 report by the Alberta Civil Liberties Research Centre recommended that Canada decriminalize polygamy , stating : " Criminalization is not the most effective way of dealing with gender inequality in polygamous and plural union relationships .
Furthermore , it may violate the constitutional rights of the parties involved . "
BRITISH COLUMBIA Section::::British Columbia .
In 2007 , the Attorney General of [ [ British Columbia ] ] expressed concerns over whether this prohibition is constitutional , and an independent prosecutor in British Columbia recommended that Canadian courts be asked to rule on the constitutionality of laws against polygamy .
The [ [ Supreme Court of British Columbia ] ] upheld Canada 's anti - polygamy section 293 of the Criminal Code and other ancillary legislation in a 2011 [ [ reference questionreference case ] ] .
On March 9 , 2018 , the Supreme Court of British Columbia upheld the constitutionality of Canada 's anti - polygamy laws again .
PUBLIC OPINION
Section::::Public opinion .
In the United States , 19 % of people believe that polygamy is morally acceptable , according to a 2018 Gallup poll .
