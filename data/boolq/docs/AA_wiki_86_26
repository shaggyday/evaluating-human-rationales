CALORIE
A calorie or calory ( archaic ) is a unit of energy .
Various definitions exist but fall into two broad categories .
The first , the small calorie ( symbol : cal ) , is defined as the amount of heat energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius at a pressure of one atmosphere .
The second , the large calorie or kilocalorie ( symbols : Cal , kcal ) , also known as the food calorie and similar names , is defined as the heat energy required to raise the temperature of one kilogram ( rather than a gram ) of water by one degree Celsius .
It is equal to small calories .
Although these units relate to the metric system , all of them have been considered obsolete in science since the adoption of the SI system .
The unit of energy in the International System of Units is the joule .
One small calorie is approximately 4.2 joules ( so one large calorie is about 4.2 kilojoules ) .
The factor used to convert calories to joules at a given temperature is numerically equivalent to the specific heat capacity of water expressed in joules per kelvin per gram ( or per kilogram , for kilocalories ) .
The precise conversion factor depends on the definition adopted .
In spite of its non - official status , the large calorie is still widely used as a unit of food energy .
The small calorie is also often used for measurements in chemistry , although the amounts involved are typically recorded in kilocalories .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The ( large ) calorie was first defined by Nicolas Clément in 1824 as a unit of heat energy .
It entered French and English dictionaries between 1841 and 1867 .
The word comes .
The small calorie was introduced by Pierre Antoine Favre ( Chemist)and Johann T. Silbermann(Physicist ) in 1852 .
In 1879 , Marcellin Berthelot introduced the convention of capitalizing the large Calorie to distinguish the senses .
The use of the ( large ) calorie for nutrition was introduced to the American public by Wilbur Olin Atwater , a professor at Wesleyan University , in 1887 .
DEFINITIONS Section::::Definitions .
The energy needed to increase the temperature of a given mass of water by 1 ° C depends on the atmospheric pressure and the starting temperature .
Accordingly , several different precise definitions of the calorie have been used .
The pressure is usually taken to be the standard atmospheric pressure ( ) .
The temperature increase can be expressed as one kelvin , which means the same as an increment of one degree Celsius . !

The two definitions most common in older literature appear to be the 15 ° C calorie and the thermochemical calorie .
Until 1948 , the latter was defined as 4.1833 international joules ; the current standard of 4.184 J was chosen to have the new thermochemical calorie represent the same quantity of energy as before .
The calorie was first defined specifically to measure energy in the form of heat , especially in experimental calorimetry .
NUTRITION Section::::Nutrition .
In a nutritional context , the kilojoule kilocalories ( kJ ) is the SI unit of food energy , although the kilocalorie is still in common use .
The word calorie is popularly used with the number of kilocalories of nutritional energy measured .
As if to avoid confusion , it is sometimes written Calorie ( with a capital " C " )
in an attempt to make the distinction , although this is not widely understood .
Capitalization contravenes the rule that the initial letter of a unit name or its derivative shall be lower case in English .
To facilitate comparison , specific energy or energy density figures are often quoted as " calories per serving " or " kilocalories per 100 g " .
A nutritional requirement or consumption is often expressed in calories per day .
One gram of fat in food contains nine calories , while a gram of either a carbohydrate or a protein contains approximately four calories .
Alcohol in a food contains seven calories per gram .
CHEMISTRY Section::::Chemistry .
In other scientific contexts , the term calorie almost always refers to the small calorie .
Even though it is not an SI unit , it is still used in chemistry .
For example , the energy released in a chemical reaction per mole of reagent is occasionally expressed in kilocalories per mole .
Typically , this use was largely due to the ease with which it could be calculated in laboratory reactions , especially in aqueous solution : a volume of reagent dissolved in water forming a solution , with concentration expressed in moles per liter ( 1 liter weighing 1 kg ) , will induce a temperature change in degrees Celsius in the total volume of water solvent , and these quantities ( volume , molar concentration and temperature change ) can then be used to calculate energy per mole .
It is also occasionally used to specify energy quantities that relate to reaction energy , such as enthalpy of formation and the size of activation barriers .
However , its use is being superseded by the SI unit , the joule , and multiples thereof such as the kilojoule .
MEASUREMENT OF ENERGY CONTENT OF FOOD
Section::::Measurement of energy content of food .
In the past a bomb calorimeter was utilised to determine the energy content of food by burning a sample and measuring a temperature change in the surrounding water .
Today this method is not commonly used in the USA and has been succeeded by calculating the energy content indirectly from adding up the energy provided by energy - containing nutrients of food ( such as protein , carbohydrates and fats ) .
The fibre content is also subtracted to account for the fact fibre is not digested by the body .
