The Pelicans were established as the New Orleans Hornets in the when then - owner of the Charlotte Hornets , George Shinn , relocated the franchise to New Orleans .

FRANCHISE HISTORY RELOCATION TO NEW ORLEANS Section::::Franchise history .
Section::::Relocation to New Orleans .
While the Charlotte Hornets put a competitive team on the court throughout the 1990s , the team 's attendance began falling dramatically .
Many attributed this lapse in popularity to the team 's owner , George Shinn , who was slowly becoming despised by the people of the city .
In 1997 , a Charlotte woman claimed that Shinn had raped her , and the resulting trial severely tarnished his reputation in the city .
The consensus was that while Charlotte was as basketball - crazy as ever , fans took out their anger at Shinn on the team .
Shinn had also become discontented with the Charlotte Coliseum , which , although considered state - of - the - art when it opened in 1988 , had by then been considered obsolete due to a limited number of luxury boxes .
On March 26 , 2001 , both the Hornets and the Vancouver Grizzlies applied for relocation to Memphis , Tennessee , which was ultimately won by the Grizzlies .
Shinn issued an ultimatum : unless the city built a new arena at no cost to him , the Hornets would leave town .
The city initially refused , leading Shinn to consider moving the team to either Norfolk , Louisville , or St. Louis .
Of the cities in the running , only St. Louis had an NBA - ready arena ( Savvis Center , now known as the Enterprise Center ) already in place and was a larger media market than Charlotte at the time ; also , it was the only one of the four to have previously hosted an NBA franchise — the St. Louis Hawks , who moved to Atlanta in 1968 .
Finally , a new arena in Uptown , which would eventually become the Charlotte Bobcats Arena ( now known as Spectrum Center ) , was included in a non - binding referendum for a larger arts - related package , and Shinn withdrew his application to move the team .
Polls showed the referendum on its way to passage .
However , just days before the referendum , Mayor Pat McCrory vetoed a living wage ordinance .
The veto prompted many of the city 's black ministers to oppose the referendum ; they felt it was immoral for the city to build a new arena when city employees were not paid enough to make a living .
After the referendum failed , city leaders devised a plan to build a new arena in a way that did not require voter support , but made it known that they would not even consider building it unless Shinn sold the team .
While even the NBA acknowledged that Shinn had alienated fans , league officials felt such a demand would anger other owners .
The city council refused to remove the statement , leading the Hornets to request a move to New Orleans – a move which would eventually return the NBA to that city since the Jazz moved to Salt Lake City in 1979 .
Before the Hornets were eliminated from the playoffs , the NBA approved the move .
As part of a deal , the NBA promised that Charlotte would get a new team , which took the court two years later as the .
In a 2008 interview with the Charlotte Observer , Shinn , who has not returned to Charlotte since the Hornets moved , admitted that the " bad judgment I made in my life " played a role in the Hornets ' departure .
He also said that if he had it to do all over again , he would not have withdrawn from the public after the sexual assault trial .
Shinn emphasized how he was making amends by committing to New Orleans saying , " I 've made enough mistakes in my life .
I 'm not going to make one here .
This city needs us here .
We 're going to make this ( New Orleans ) thing work . "
2002–2005

The Hornets looked at many teams , including the Boston Celtics and the Golden State Warriors as trade partners , but Paul had made it clear he wanted to be traded to New York or Los Angeles .
A three - team trade involving the Los Angeles Lakers and the Houston Rockets was agreed upon , but commissioner David Stern vetoed the trade .
On December 14 , 2011 , the Hornets agreed to a deal with the Los Angeles Clippers that would send Paul to Los Angeles in exchange for Eric Gordon , Chris Kaman , Al - Farouq Aminu , and a first - round draft pick acquired by the Clippers from a trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2004 .

On April 13 , 2012 , it was announced that Tom Benson , owner of the National Football League 's New Orleans Saints , had purchased the franchise from the NBA for $ 338 million .
In addition , Benson announced that he would change the team name to something that would better suit the region , fueling rumors that the Hornets name could one day return to Charlotte , where the Charlotte Bobcats played .

2013–PRESENT Section::::2013–present .
New owner Tom Benson had indicated early in his ownership that he wished to change the team 's name to something more local , even preferring that the Utah Jazz – founded in New Orleans in 1974 and played there until 1979 – give up the " Jazz " name , but the Jazz indicated they had no interest in returning the name due to over 30 years of history associated with it .
Benson had also heavily favored the names " Brass " and " Krewe " .
However , on December 4 , 2012 , it was reported that the Hornets would change their name to the New Orleans Pelicans beginning with the 2013–14 season .
The team name is inspired by Louisiana 's state bird , the brown pelican .
The name " Pelicans " previously had been used by a minor - league baseball team that played in New Orleans from 1901 to 1957 .
The Hornets organization officially confirmed the name change in a press conference held on January 24 , 2013 , where officials unveiled the team 's new logos and navy blue – gold – red color scheme .
On April 18 , 2013 , after the end of the team 's 2012–13 season , the team 's name was officially changed to the Pelicans .
Following the New Orleans franchise 's 2013 disestablishment of the " Hornets " name , on May 21 , 2013 , the Charlotte Bobcats ' owner Michael Jordan officially announced the organization had submitted an application to change the name of his franchise to the Charlotte Hornets for the 2014–15 season pending a majority vote for approval by the NBA Board of Governors at a meeting in Las Vegas , on July 18 , 2013 .
Then - NBA Deputy Commissioner and COO Adam Silver had previously pointed out that the league owns the rights to the name Hornets and that could speed up the process .
The NBA unanimously approved the name change starting with 2014–15 .
On June 27 , 2013 , during the 2013 NBA draft , the Pelicans selected Nerlens Noel 6th overall , and traded him along with a 2014 protected first - round pick for All - Star point guard Jrue Holiday of the Philadelphia 76ers and the 42nd pick , Pierre Jackson .
At a May 20 , 2014 , press conference announcing the Charlotte Bobcats ' official team name change to Hornets , it was also announced that the Pelicans agreed to transfer the records and statistics of the original Hornets ( 1988–2002 ) to the current Charlotte franchise , thus unifying all of Charlotte 's NBA basketball history under one franchise ; the team records and statistics since the 2002 move to New Orleans would be retained by the Pelicans , retroactively turning the Pelicans into a 2002 expansion team .
To restate and clarify the series of events : after the 2002 season , the original Hornets moved to New Orleans .
In 2004 , Charlotte was granted a new franchise , the Bobcats .
After the 2013–14 season , the Bobcats changed their name to the Hornets and reclaimed the history and records of the 1988–2002 Hornets .

On February 1 , 2018 , the Pelicans acquired Nikola Mirotić in a trade with the Chicago Bulls .
Though the trade went through , a previous trade for Mirotić to the Pelicans was called off when New Orleans did not want to pay for Mirotić 's 2019 team option contract , that Mirotić signed with the Bulls during the off - season in 2017 .
The Pelicans received Mirotić and a 2018 second - round pick for veterans Ömer Aşık , Jameer Nelson , and Tony Allen .
