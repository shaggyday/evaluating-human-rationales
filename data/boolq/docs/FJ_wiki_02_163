PLOT Section::::Plot .
Paul Blart lives in West Orange , New Jersey , with his teenage daughter , Maya , and mother , Margaret .
Aspiring to join the New Jersey State Police , he trains at the police academy , but his hypoglycemic medical condition causes him to collapse , therefore failing the exam .
To shape up for his career , Blart works as a security guard at the fictional West Orange Pavilion Mall .
Blart patrols the mall on a Segway to assure that things are safe and clean .
He also trains Veck Simms , who is new but uninterested in the job .
Meanwhile , Blart becomes acquainted with Amy Anderson , the vendor of a new kiosk .
He meets her one evening at a party at Joe 's American Bar and Grill with other mall employees .
Things initially go well , but Blart is sidetracked when he decides to participate in a nacho - eating contest with his friend Leon .
The hot and spicy salsa is more than Blart can handle , causing him to inadvertently drink several alcoholic beverages .
He ruins the party and makes a wild exit by falling through a window .
Two days later , on the night of Black Friday , an organized gang of thugs disguised as Santa 's Village employees begin what appears to be a bank heist inside the mall .
They take Amy and other customers in the bank hostage .
Simms is revealed as the gang 's leader â€“ his mall security job was a ploy to gather intelligence .
They are keeping the hostages as insurance for the gang 's escape .
The crew force shoppers to exit the mall and strategically place motion sensors around each entrance to detect any attempt to enter or exit the building .
Blart takes a break in the arcade and plays " Detroit Rock City " via Rock Band .
He eventually walks back out in the mall , and discovers the entire mall is evacuated and under a state of emergency .
Upon realizing this , he calls the police , and slips out of the mall to speak with Commander Sergeant Howard .
Blart realizes Amy is still inside after spotting her car in the parking lot , and decides to return to the mall to look for her .
A SWAT team arrives with Commander James Kent at the helm .
Kent , a former classmate and bully from Blart 's childhood , takes control of the police units and orders Blart to let them handle the situation .
Blart refuses and attempts a rescue .
Vastly outnumbered and physically outclassed , Blart takes a stand against Simms ' crew using improvised measures to take them down one by one .
He discovers credit card codes written in invisible ink on the burglars ' arms and realizes that their real plans go beyond robbing the bank .
Maya , unaware of what has happened , shows up at the mall on her way to bring Blart some food , but Simms ' remaining henchmen seize her and add her to the hostage group .
Blart manages to subdue all of Simms ' accomplices and attempts to evacuate the hostages by pulling them up through an air vent .
The plan fails when Leon does not fit .
Simms enters the room , capturing Blart and forcing him to give up the credit card codes he recorded on his cell phone .
Simms flees , taking Amy and Maya with him .
As police raid the mall to apprehend the criminals and rescue the hostages , Blart borrows a display minivan and joins Kent in pursuing Simms to the airport , where he is attempting to escape to the Cayman Islands .
After a brief scuffle , Blart overpowers Simms and puts him in handcuffs .
Moments later , however , Kent pulls his gun on Blart , revealing that he was in cahoots with Simms .
Kent demands the phone containing the codes from Blart , who refuses and destroys the phone .
Before Kent can retaliate by shooting Blart , Chief Brooks of the mall security team arrives and shoots Kent in the arm .
Kent and Simms are arrested , and Amy and Maya are returned safely .
For his bravery and assistance , Howard offers Blart a job with the West Orange Police Department .
Blart inexplicably declines , preferring to remain in mall security .
Blart and Amy are eventually married in the mall , where they exchange vows on a set of black and white Segways .

Interior filming took place mostly at night .
Some of the aerial stunts , such as Blart being attacked in the scenic elevator , were performed at the South Shore Plaza in Braintree , MA , as the Burlington Mall 's construction did not allow for some of these stunts .
