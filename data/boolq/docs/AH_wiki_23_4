BERRY
A berry is a small , pulpy , and often edible fruit .
Typically , berries are juicy , rounded , brightly colored , sweet or sour , and do not have a stone or pit , although many pips or seeds may be present .
Common examples are strawberries , raspberries , blueberries , blackberries , red currants , white currants and blackcurrants .
In Britain , soft fruit is a horticultural term for such fruits .
The scientific usage of the term " berry " differs from common usage .
In scientific terminology , a berry is a fruit produced from the ovary of a single flower in which the outer layer of the ovary wall develops into an edible fleshy portion ( pericarp ) .
The definition includes many fruits that are not commonly known as berries , such as grapes , tomatoes , cucumbers , eggplants , bananas , and chili peppers .
Fruits excluded by the botanical definition include strawberries , raspberries , and blackberries , which are aggregate fruits ; and mulberries , which are multiple fruits .
A plant bearing berries is said to be bacciferous or baccate .
While many berries are edible , some are poisonous to humans , such as deadly nightshade and pokeweed .
Others , such as the white mulberry , red mulberry , and elderberry , are poisonous when unripe , but are edible when ripe .
Berries are eaten worldwide and often used in jams , preserves , cakes , or pies .
Some berries are commercially important .
The berry industry varies from country to country as do types of berries cultivated or growing in the wild .
Some berries such as raspberries and strawberries have been bred for hundreds of years and are distinct from their wild counterparts , while other berries , such as lingonberries and cloudberries , grow almost exclusively in the wild .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Berries have been valuable as a food source for humans since before the start of agriculture , and remain among the primary food sources of other primates .
They were a seasonal staple for early hunter - gatherers for thousands of years , and wild berry gathering remains a popular activity in Europe and North America today .
In time , humans learned to store berries so that they could be used in the winter .
They may be made into fruit preserves , and among Native Americans , mixed with meat and fats as pemmican .
Berries also began to be cultivated in Europe and other countries .
Some species of blackberries and raspberries of the genus Rubus have been cultivated since the 17th century , while smooth - skinned blueberries and cranberries of the genus Vaccinium have been cultivated in the United States for over a century .
In Japan , between the 10th and 18th centuries , the term referred to many berry crops .
The most widely cultivated berry of modern times , however , is the strawberry , which is produced globally at twice the amount of all other berry crops combined .
The strawberry was mentioned by ancient Romans , who thought it had medicinal properties , but it was then not a staple of agriculture .
Woodland strawberries began to be grown in French gardens in the 14th century .
The musky - flavored strawberry ( F. moschata ) began to be grown in European gardens in the late 16th century .
Later , the Virginia strawberry was grown in Europe and the United States .
The most commonly consumed strawberry , the garden strawberry ( F. ananassa ) , is an accidental hybrid of the Virginia strawberry and a Chilean variety Fragaria chiloensis .
It was first noted by a French gardener around the mid 18th century that , when F. moschata and F. virginiana were planted in between rows of F. chiloensis , the Chilean strawberry would bear abundant and unusually large fruits .
Soon after , Antoine Nicolas Duchesne began to study the breeding of strawberries and made several discoveries crucial to the science of plant breeding , such as the sexual reproduction of strawberry .
Later , in the early 1800s , English breeders of strawberry made varieties of F. ananassa which were important in strawberry breeding in Europe , and hundreds of cultivars have since been produced through the breeding of strawberries .
ETYMOLOGY Section::::Etymology .
A form of the word " berry " is found in all the Germanic languages ; for example , Old English berie compares with Old Saxon and Old High German beri , and Old Norse ber .
These forms point to the Proto Germanic * bazją .
In Old English , the word was mainly applied to grapes , but has since grown to its current definition .
BOTANICAL DEFINITION Section::::Botanical definition .
In botanical terminology , a berry is a simple fruit with seeds and pulp produced from the ovary of a single flower .
It is fleshy throughout , except for the seeds .
It does not have a special " line of weakness " along which it splits to release the seeds when ripe ( i.e. it is indehiscent ) .
A berry may develop from an ovary with one or more carpels ( the female reproductive structures of a flower ) .
The seeds are usually embedded in the fleshy interior of the ovary , but there are some non - fleshy examples such as peppers , with air rather than pulp around their seeds .
The differences between the everyday and botanical uses of " berry " results in three categories : those fruits that are berries under both definitions ; those fruits that are botanical berries but not commonly known as berries ; and those parts of plants commonly known as berries that are not botanical berries , and may not even be fruits .
Berries under both definitions include blueberries , cranberries , lingonberries , and the fruits of many other members of the heather family , as well as gooseberries , goji berries and elderberries .
The fruits of some " currants " ( Ribes species ) , such as blackcurrants , red currants and white currants , are botanical berries , and are treated as horticultural berries ( or as soft fruit in the UK ) , even though their most commonly used names do not include the word " berry " .
Botanical berries not commonly known as berries include bananas , tomatoes , grapes , eggplants ( aubergines ) , persimmons , watermelons , and pumpkins .
There are several different kinds of fruits which are commonly called berries , but are not botanical berries .
Blackberries , raspberries , and strawberries are kinds of aggregate fruit ; they contain seeds from different ovaries of a single flower .
In aggregate fruits like blackberries , the individual " fruitlets " making up the fruit can be clearly seen .
The fruits of blackthorn may be called " sloe berries " , but botanically are small stone fruits or drupes , like plums or apricots .
Junipers and yews are commonly said to have berries , but these differ from botanical berries and are instead highly modified seed - bearing cones .
In juniper berries , used to flavour gin , the cone scales , which are hard and woody in most conifers , are instead soft and fleshy when ripe .
The bright red berries of yews consist of a fleshy outgrowth ( aril ) almost enclosing the poisonous seed .
CULTIVATION Section::::Cultivation .
Strawberries have been grown in gardens in Europe since the 14th century .
Blueberries were domesticated starting in 1911 , with the first commercial crop in 1916 .
Huckleberries of all varieties are not fully domesticated , but domestication was attempted from 1994 - 2010 for the economically significant western huckleberry .
Many other varieties of Vaccinium are likewise not domesticated , with some being of commercial importance .
AGRICULTURAL METHODS
Section::::Agricultural methods .
Like most other food crops , berries are commercially grown , with both conventional pest management and integrated pest management ( IPM ) practices .
Organically certified berries are becoming more widely available .
Many soft fruit berries require a period of temperatures between 0 ° C and 10 ° C for breaking dormancy .
In general , strawberries require 200–300 hours , blueberries 650–850 hours , blackberries 700 hours , raspberries 800–1700 hours , currants and gooseberries 800–1500 hours , and cranberries 2000 hours .
However , too low a temperature will kill the crops : blueberries do not tolerate temperatures below -29 ° C , raspberries , depending on variety , may tolerate as low as -31 ° C , and blackberries are injured below -20 ° C .
Spring frosts are , however , much more damaging to berry crops than low winter temperatures .
Sites with moderate slopes ( 3 - 5 % ) , facing north or east , in the northern hemisphere , near large bodies of water , which regulate spring temperature , are considered ideal in preventing spring frost injury to the new leaves and flowers .
All berry crops have shallow root systems .
Many land - grant university extension offices suggest that strawberries should not be planted more than five years on the same site , due to the danger of black root rot ( though many other illnesses go by the same name ) , which is controlled in major commercial production by annual methyl bromide fumigation .
Besides the number of years in production , soil compaction , the frequency of fumigation , and herbicide usages increase the appearance of black root rot in strawberries .
Raspberries , blackberries , strawberries , and many other berries are susceptible to verticillium wilt .
Blueberries and cranberries grow poorly if the clay or silt content of the soil is more than 20 % , while most other berries tolerate a wide range of soil types .
For most berry crops , the ideal soil is well drained sandy loam , with a pH of 6.2 - 6.8 and a moderate to high organic content ; however , blueberries have an ideal pH of 4.2 - 4.8 and can be grown on muck soils , while blueberries and cranberries prefer poorer soils with lower cation exchange , lower calcium , and lower levels of phosphorus .
Growing
most berries organically requires the use of proper crop rotation , the right mix of cover crops , and the cultivation of the correct beneficial microorganisms in the soil .
As blueberries and cranberries thrive in soils that are not hospitable to most other plants , and conventional fertilizers are toxic to them , the primary concern when growing them organically is bird management .
Post - harvest small fruit berries are generally stored at 90 - 95 % relative humidity and 0 ° C .
Cranberries , however , are frost sensitive , and should be stored at 3 C. Blueberries are the only berries that respond to ethylene , but flavor does not improve after harvest , so they require the same treatment as other berries .
Removal of ethylene may reduce disease and spoilage in all berries .
Precooling within one to two hours post - harvest to storage temperature , generally 0 ° C , via forced air cooling increases the storage life of berries by about a third .
Under optimum storage conditions , raspberries and blackberries last for two to five days , strawberries 7–10 days , blueberries two to four weeks , and cranberries two to four months .
Berries can be shipped under high carbon dioxide or modified atmosphere of 10 - 15 % carbon dioxide for high carbon dioxide or 15 - 20 % carbon dioxide and 5 - 10 % oxygen for a modified atmosphere container to increase shelf life and prevent grey mold rot .
BREEDING Section::::Breeding .
Several discoveries in the science of breeding berries were made in the 18th century by Antoine Nicolas Duchesne in his work on strawberries .
In the traditional technique of plant breeding , berries with specific desirable characteristics were chosen and allowed to sexually reproduce with other berries , and offspring with improved traits could then be selected and used for further crossing .
Plants may be hybridized with different species within the same genus ; hybridization between different genus may also be possible , but more difficult .
Breeding may seek to increase the size and yield of the fruit , improve the flavor and quality of its nutrient content , such as antioxidants , expand the harvest season , and produce cultivars with resistance to diseases , tolerance of hot or cold conditions , and other desirable traits .
Advancements in molecular biology and genetic engineering allow for a more efficient and better targeted approach in the selection for a desirable genotype , via marker - assisted selection , for example .
Genetic modification techniques can also be used for breeding berries .
HORTICULTURAL SOFT FRUIT BERRIES
Section::::Horticultural soft fruit berries .
Some fruit not commonly referred to as berries and not always botanically berries are included by land - grant university extension offices in their guides for berry cultivation , or in guides for identifying local wild edible and non - edible berries .
Examples include beach plums , American persimmons , pawpaws , Pacific crabapples , and prickly pears .
COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION Section::::Commercial production .
One source suggests that , in the year 2005 , there were 1.8 million acres of land worldwide cultivating berries , with 6.3 million tons produced .
ECONOMICS Section::::Economics .
According to figures from Global Berry Congress 2015 in the US , over 6 million dollars of soft fruit are sold , accounting for 19 % of total supermarket revenue , more than bananas ( a botanical berry ) at 11 % , and apples ( 14 % ) , with continued rapid growth in the market expected .
In certain regions , berrypicking can be a large part of the economy , and it is becoming increasingly common for western European countries such as Sweden and Finland to import cheap labor from Thailand or Bulgaria to do the berry picking .
This practice has come under scrutiny in the past years because of the low wages and poor living standard for the " berry - pickers " , as well as the lack of worker safety .
COLOR AND POTENTIAL
HEALTH BENEFITS Section::::Color and potential health benefits .
Once ripened , berries are typically of a contrasting color to their background ( often of green leaves ) , making them visible and attractive to frugivorous animals and birds .
This assists the wide dispersal of the plants ' seeds .
Berry colors are due to natural plant pigments , such as anthocyanins , together with other flavonoids localized mainly in berry skins , seeds and leaves .
Although berry pigments have antioxidant properties in vitro , there is insufficient physiological evidence established to date that berry pigments have actual antioxidant or any other functions within the human body .
Consequently , it is not permitted to claim that foods containing polyphenols have antioxidant health value on product labels in the United States or Europe .
CULINARY SIGNIFICANCE USE IN BAKED GOODS Section::::Culinary significance .
Section::::Use in baked goods .
Berries are commonly used in pies or tarts , such as grape pie , blueberry pie , blackberry pie , and strawberry pie .
Berries are often used in baking , such as blueberry muffins , blackberry muffins , berry cobblers , berry crisps , berry cakes , berry buckles , berry crumb cakes , berry tea cakes , and berry cookies .
Berries are commonly incorporated whole into the batter for baking , and care is often taken so as to not burst the berries .
Frozen or dried berries may be preferable for some baked berry products .
Fresh berries are also often incorporated into baked berry desserts , sometimes with cream , either as a filling to the dessert or as a topping .
BEVERAGES Section::::Beverages .
Berries are often added to water and/or juiced , as in cranberry juice , which accounts for 95 % of cranberry crop usage , blueberry juice , raspberry juice , goji berry juice , acai juice , aronia berry juice , and strawberry juice .
Wine is the principal fermented beverage made from berries ( grapes ) .
Fruit wines are commonly made out of other berries .
In most cases , sugars must be added to the berry juices in the process of Chaptalization to increase the alcohol content of the wine .
Examples of fruit wines made from berries include : elderberry wine , strawberry wine , blueberry wine , blackberry wine , redcurrant wine , huckleberry wine , goji wine and cranberry wine .
Berries are used in some styles of beer , particularly framboise ( made with raspberry ) and other fruit lambics .
DRIED
Section::::Dried .
Currants , raisins and sultanas are examples of dried grape berries , and many other commercially important berries are available in dried form .
FRUIT PRESERVES Section::::Fruit preserves .
Berries are perishable fruits with a short shelf life , and are often preserved by drying , freezing , pickling or making fruit preserves .
Berries such as blackberry , blueberry , boysenberry , lingonberry , loganberry , raspberry , and strawberry are often used in jams and jellies .
In the United States , Native Americans were " the first to make preserves from blueberries " .
OTHER USAGES
Section::::Other usages .
Chefs have created quick pickled soft fruit , such as blackberries , strawberries , and blueberries .
Strawberries can be battered and quickly fried in a deep fryer .
Sauces made from berries , such as cranberry sauce , can be frozen until hard , battered , and deep fried .
Cranberry sauce is a traditional food item for Thanksgiving , and similar sauces can be made from many other berries such as blueberries , raspberries , blackberries , and huckleberries .
CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE DYEING Section::::Cultural significance .
Section::::Dyeing .
Berries have been used in some cultures for dyeing .
Many berries contain juices that can easily stain , affording use as a natural dye .
For example , blackberries are useful for making dyes , especially when ripe berries can easily release juice to produce a colorfast effect .
Rubus berries , such as blackberry , raspberry , black raspberry , dewberry , loganberry , and thimbleberry all produce dye colors .
These were once used by Native Americans .
In Hawaii , the native raspberry called ' akala ' was used to dye tapa cloth with lavender and pink hues , whereas berries from the dianella lily were used for blue coloration , and berries from the black nightshade were used to produce green coloration .
In Swaziland , several berry species are used as a dye .
