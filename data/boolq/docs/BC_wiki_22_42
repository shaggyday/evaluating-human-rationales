HALICTIDAE
The Halictidae is the second largest family of Apoidea bees .
Halictid species occur all over the world and are usually dark - colored and often metallic in appearance .
Several species are all or partly green and a few are red ; a number of them have yellow markings , especially the males , which commonly possess yellow faces , a pattern widespread among the various families of bees .
They are commonly referred to as " sweat bees " ( especially the smaller species ) , as they are often attracted to perspiration .
They are likely to sting only if disturbed ; the sting is minor .
ECOLOGY Section::::Ecology .
Most halictids nest in the ground , though a few nest in wood , and they mass - provision
their young ( a mass of pollen and nectar is formed inside a waterproof cell , an egg laid upon it , and the cell sealed off , so the larva is given all of its food at one time , as opposed to " progressive provisioning " , where a larva is fed repeatedly as it grows , as in honey bees ) .
All species ( except for those which are kleptoparasites ) are pollen feeders and may be important pollinators .
EUSOCIAL SPECIES Section::::Eusocial species .
Many species in the subfamily Halictinae are eusocial at least in part , such as Lasioglossum malachurum or Halictus rubicundus , with fairly well - defined queen and worker castes ( though not the same as the caste system in honey bees ) , and certain manifestations of their social behavior appear to be facultative in various lineages .
Those species who do not have a permanent , rigid , division of labor , such as Lasioglossum zephyrum , are considered primitively eusocial .
Another example of a primitive eusocial bee species from this family is the Halictus ligatus species , for which aggression is one of the most influential behavioral attitudes for establishing hierarchy and social organization within the colony .
Primitively eusocial species such as these provide insight into the early evolution of eusociality .
Halictus sexcinctus , which exhibits social , communal , and eusocial organization , provides insight into the evolutionary reversal of eusociality .
Phylogenetic data from this species suggests that a communal strategy serves as a transitional step between eusociality and a reversion back to solitary nesting .
CLEPTOPARASITIC SPECIES
Section::::Cleptoparasitic species .
Several genera and species of halictids are cleptoparasites of other bees ( mostly other halictids ) , and the behavior has evolved at least 9 times independently within the family .
The most well - known and common are species in the genus Sphecodes , which are somewhat wasp - like in appearance ( often shining black with blood - red abdomen-
German : Blutbienen - usually 4–9 mm in body length ) ; the female Sphecodes enters the cell with the provision mass , eats the host egg , and lays an egg of her own in its place .
" NOCTURNAL " SPECIES Section::::"Nocturnal " species .
Halictidae are one of the four bee families that contain some crepuscular species ; these halictids are active only at dusk or in the early evening , so are technically considered " vespertine " ( e.g. in the subgenus Sphecodogastra of Lasioglossum ) , or sometimes truly nocturnal ( e.g. in the genus Megalopta , or species Megalopta genalis ) .
These bees , as is typical in such cases , have greatly enlarged ocelli .
The other families with some crepuscular species are Andrenidae , Colletidae , and Apidae .
SPECIES OF ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE Section::::Species of economic importance .
Some species are important in the pollination of crops .
Among these are the alkali bee , Lasioglossum vierecki and Lasioglossum leucozonium .
PHYLOGENY Section::::Phylogeny .
The Halictidae belong to the hymenopteran superfamily Apoidea , series Anthophila .
The oldest fossil record of Halictidae dates back to Early Eocene with a number of species , such as Neocorynura electra and Augochlora leptoloba known from amber deposits .
Currently , the family is divided into four subfamilies , many genera and more than 2000 known species .
The Rophitinae appear to be the sister group to the remaining three subfamilies ( Nomiinae , Nomioidinae , Halictinae ) based on both morphology and molecular data .
