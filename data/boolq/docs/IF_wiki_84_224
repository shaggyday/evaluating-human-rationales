CONSTITUTION
Section::::Constitution .
The foremost source of state law is the Constitution of New York .
The Constitution of New York in turn is subordinate only to the Constitution of the United States , which is the supreme law of the land .
STATUTORY LAW Section::::Statutory law .
Pursuant to the state constitution , the New York State Legislature has enacted legislation , called chapter laws or slip laws when printed separately .
The bills and concurrent resolutions proposing amendments to the state or federal constitutions of each legislative session are called session laws and published in the official Laws of New York .
The codification of the permanent laws of a general nature are contained in the Consolidated Laws of New York .
New York uses a system called " continuous codification " whereby each session law clearly identifies the law and section of the Consolidated Laws affected by its passage .
Unlike real codes , the Consolidated Laws are systematic but neither comprehensive nor preemptive , and reference to other laws and case law is often necessary .
There also exist unconsolidated laws , such as the various court acts .
Unconsolidiated laws are uncodified , typically due to their local nature , but are otherwise legally binding .
There are also numerous sources used for statutory interpretation ( e.g. , legislative intent ) .
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW
Section::::Administrative law .
Pursuant to certain broadly worded statutes , state agencies and courts have promulgated an enormous body of rules and regulations ( delegated legislation ) .
Regulations are promulgated with and published in the New York State Register and compiled in the New York Codes , Rules and Regulations ( NYCRR ) .
There are also numerous decisions , opinions , and rulings of state agencies .
Altogether these are sometimes called administrative law .
CASE LAW Section::::Case law .
Decisions of the New York Court of Appeals are binding authority on all other courts , and persuasive authority for itself in later cases .
Decisions of the New York Supreme Court , Appellate Division department panels are binding on the lower courts , and are persuasive authority for the Court of Appeals , other Appellate Division departments .
In the absence of a relevant Appellate Division decision from a trial court 's own department , the trial court is bound by the applicable decisions of other departments .
Decisions by the Supreme Court , Appellate Term must be followed by courts whose appeals lie to it .
Published trial court decisions are persuasive authority for all other courts in the state .
The New York State Courts Electronic Filing System ( NYSCEF ) is the electronic court filing ( e - filing ) system .
The New York State Reporter of the New York State Law Reporting Bureau is the official reporter of decisions and is required to publish every opinion , memorandum , and motion sent to it by the Court of Appeals and the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the New York Reports and Appellate Division Reports , respectively .
The trial court and Supreme Court appellate term opinions are published selectively in the Miscellaneous Reports .

LOCAL LAW
Section::::Local law .
New York is divided into counties , cities , towns , and villages , which are all municipal corporations with their own government .
New York City contains no county , town or village governments other than the government of New York City .
The Constitution of New York enumerates the powers of local governments , such as the power to elect a legislative body and adopt local laws .
Counties , cities , and towns may also promulgate ordinances in addition to laws .
A local law has a status equivalent with a law enacted by the Legislature ( subject to certain exceptions and restrictions ) , and is superior to the older forms of municipal legislation such as ordinances , resolutions , rules and regulations .
Each local government ( such as counties ) must designate a newspaper of notice to publish or describe its laws .
The Secretary of State is responsible for publishing local laws online and as a supplement to the Laws of New York .
Local laws are not effective until they have been filed with the Secretary of State in the form designated .
With respect to New York City , the codified local laws are contained in the New York City Administrative Code consisting of 29 titles , the regulations promulgated by city agencies are contained in the Rules of the City of New York consisting of 71 titles , and The City Record is the official journal ( newspaper of notice ) published each weekday ( except legal holidays ) containing legal notices produced by city agencies .
