HISTORY Section::::History .
On June 8 , 1944 , the U.S. First Army established the temporary cemetery , the first American cemetery on European soil in World War II .
After the war , the present - day cemetery was established a short distance to the east of the original site .
Like all other overseas American cemeteries in France for World War I and II , France has granted the United States a special , perpetual concession to the land occupied by the cemetery , free of any charge or any tax to honor the forces .
This cemetery is managed by the American Battle Monuments Commission , a small independent agency of the U.S. federal government , under Congressional acts that provide yearly financial support for maintaining them , with most military and civil personnel employed abroad .
The U.S. flag flies over these granted soils .

Included are graves of Army Air Corps crews shot down over France as early as 1942 and three American women .
Only some of the soldiers who died overseas are buried in the overseas American military cemeteries .
When it came time for a permanent burial , the next of kin eligible to make decisions were asked if they wanted their loved ones repatriated for permanent burial in the U.S. , or interred at the closest overseas cemetery .

In the horror film The Omen ( 1976 ) , the cemetery is used as a main photo poster with Damien standing next to the thousands of graves .
*
In Saving Private Ryan ( 1998 ) , the cemetery is featured at the beginning and end , showing World War II veteran Private James Francis Ryan accompanied by his family .
In the beginning of the film , he makes his way to the grave of Captain John Miller ( played by Tom Hanks ) .
At the end , Ryan salutes the grave and asks his wife if he lived a good life and was a good man .
( Both the grave and Captain John Miller are fictional ; the headstone for Miller was only brought to the cemetery for the movie . )
The Private Ryan story is based upon the story of the Niland Brothers , two of whom are buried in the cemetery ; references are also made to the five Sullivan brothers , who were all killed in the " Juneau incident " .
