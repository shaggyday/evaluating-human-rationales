It was designed by Antonio Contino ( whose uncle Antonio da Ponte had designed the Rialto Bridge ) and was built in 1600 .
ETYMOLOGY Section::::Etymology .
The view from the Bridge of Sighs was the last view of Venice that convicts saw before their imprisonment .
The bridge 's name , given by Lord Byron as a translation from the Italian " Ponte dei sospiri " in the 19th century , comes from the suggestion that prisoners would sigh at their final view of beautiful Venice through the window before being taken down to their cells .
In reality , the days of inquisitions and summary executions were over by the time the bridge was built , and the cells under the palace roof were occupied mostly by small - time criminals .
In addition , little could be seen from inside the bridge due to the stone grills covering the windows .
