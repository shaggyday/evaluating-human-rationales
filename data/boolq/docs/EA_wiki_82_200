WHITE TIGER
The white tiger or bleached tiger is a pigmentation variant of the Bengal tiger , which is reported in the wild from time to time in the Indian states of Madhya Pradesh , Assam , West Bengal and Bihar in the Sunderbans region and especially in the former State of Rewa .
Such a tiger has the black stripes typical of the Bengal tiger , but carries a white or near - white coat .
VARIATION Section::::Variation .
The white Bengal tigers are distinctive due to the color of their fur .
The white fur caused by a lack of the pigment pheomelanin , which is found in Bengal tigers with orange color fur .
When compared to Bengal tigers , the white Bengal tigers tend to grow faster and heavier than the orange Bengal tiger .
They also tend to be somewhat bigger at birth , and as fully grown adults .
White Bengal tigers are fully grown when they are 2–3 years of age .
White male tigers reach weights of 200 to 230 kilograms and can grow up to 3 meters in length .
As with all tigers , the white Bengal tiger 's stripes are like fingerprints , with no two tigers having the same pattern .
The stripes of the tiger are a pigmentation of the skin ; if an individual were to be shaved , its distinctive coat pattern would still be visible .
For a white Bengal tiger to be born , both parents must carry the unusual gene for white colouring , which only happens naturally about once in 10,000 births .
Dark - striped white individuals are well - documented in the Bengal tiger subspecies ( Panthera tigris tigris ) as well as having been reported historically in several other subspecies .
Currently , several hundred white tigers are in captivity worldwide , with about one hundred being found in India .
Their unique white color fur has made them popular in entertainment showcasing exotic animals , and at zoos .
STRIPELESS TIGERS Section::::Stripeless tigers .
An additional genetic condition can remove most of the striping of a white tiger , making the animal almost pure white .
One such specimen was exhibited at Exeter Change in England in 1820 , and described by Georges Cuvier as " A white variety of Tiger is sometimes seen , with the stripes very opaque , and not to be observed except in certain angles of light . "
Naturalist Richard Lydekker said that , " a white tiger , in which the fur was of a creamy tint , with the usual stripes faintly visible in certain parts , was exhibited at the old menagerie at Exeter Change about the year 1820 . "
Hamilton Smith said , " A wholly white tiger , with the stripe - pattern visible only under reflected light , like the pattern of a white tabby cat , was exhibited in the Exeter Change Menagerie in 1820 . " , and John George Wood stated that , " a creamy white , with the ordinary tigerine stripes so faintly marked that they were only visible in certain lights . "
Edwin Henry Landseer also drew this tigress in 1824 .
The modern strain of snow white tigers came from repeated brother – sister matings of Bhim and Sumita at Cincinnati Zoo .
The gene involved may have come from a Siberian tiger , via their part - Siberian ancestor Tony .
Continued inbreeding appears to have caused a recessive gene for stripelessness to show up .
About one fourth of Bhim and Sumita 's offspring were stripeless .
Their striped white offspring , which have been sold to zoos around the world , may also carry the stripeless gene .
Because Tony 's genome is present in many white tiger pedigrees , the gene may also be present in other captive white tigers .
As a result , stripeless white tigers have appeared in zoos as far afield as the Czech Republic ( Liberec ) , Spain and Mexico .
Stage magicians Siegfried & Roy were the first to attempt to selectively breed tigers for stripelessness ; they owned snow - white Bengal tigers taken from Cincinnati Zoo ( Tsumura , Mantra , Mirage and Akbar - Kabul ) and Guadalajara , Mexico ( Vishnu and Jahan ) , as well as a stripeless Siberian tiger called Apollo .
In 2004 , a blue - eyed , stripeless white tiger was born in a wildlife refuge in Alicante , Spain .
Its parents are normal orange Bengals .
The cub was named Artico ( " Arctic " ) .
GENETICS Section::::Genetics .
A white tiger 's pale coloration is due to the lack of the red and yellow pheomelanin pigments that normally produce the orange coloration .
This had long been thought to be due to a mutation in the gene for the tyrosinase enzyme .
A knockout mutation in this gene results in albinism , the inability to make either pheomelanin ( red and yellow pigments ) or eumelanin ( black and brown pigments ) , while a less severe mutation in the same gene in other mammals results in selective loss of pheomelanin , the so - called Chinchilla trait .
The white phenotype in tigers had been attributed to such a Chinchilla mutation in tyrosinase , and in the past white tigers were sometimes referred to as ' partial albinos ' .
However , whole genome sequencing of normal and white tigers demonstrated instead that a naturally - occurring point mutation in the SLC45A2 gene is responsible .
The resultant single amino acid substitution introduces an alanine residue that protrudes into the transport protein 's central passageway , apparently blocking it , and by a mechanism yet to be determined this prevents pheomelanin expression in the fur .
Mutations in the same gene are known to underlie the cream coloration of horses , and play a role in the paler skin of humans of European descent .
This is a recessive trait , meaning that it is only seen in individuals that are homozygous for this mutation , but that white tigers can be bred from any colored Bengal tiger pair each possessing the unique mutation .
Inbreeding promotes recessive traits and has been used as a strategy to produce white tigers in captivity , but this has also resulted in a range of other genetic defects .
The stripe color varies due to the influence and interaction of other genes .
Another genetic characteristic makes the stripes of the tiger very pale ; white tigers of this type are called snow - white or " pure white " .
White tigers , Siamese cats , and Himalayan rabbits have enzymes in their fur which react to temperature , causing them to grow darker in the cold .
A white tiger named Mohini was whiter than her relatives in the Bristol Zoo , who showed more cream tones .
This may have been because she spent less time outdoors in the winter .
Kailash Sankhala observed that white tigers were always whiter in Rewa State , even when they were born in New Delhi and returned there . "
In spite of living in a dusty courtyard , they were always snow white .
"
A weakened immune system is directly linked to reduced pigmentation in white tigers .
DEFECTS Section::::Defects .
Outside of India , inbred white tigers have been prone to crossed eyes , a condition known as strabismus , due to incorrectly routed visual pathways in the brains of white tigers .
When stressed or confused , all white tigers cross their eyes .
Strabismus is associated with white tigers of mixed Bengal x Siberian ancestry .
The only pure - Bengal white tiger reported to be cross - eyed was Mohini 's daughter Rewati .
Strabismus is directly linked to the white gene and is not a separate consequence of inbreeding .
The orange litter - mates of white tigers are not prone to strabismus .
Siamese cats and albinos of every species which have been studied all exhibit the same visual pathway abnormality found in white tigers .
Siamese cats are also sometimes cross - eyed , as are some albino ferrets .
The visual pathway abnormality was first documented in white tigers in the brain of a white tiger called Moni after he died , although his eyes were of normal alignment .
The abnormality is that there is a disruption in the optic chiasm .
The examination of Moni 's brain suggested the disruption is less severe in white tigers than it is in Siamese cats .
Because of the visual pathway abnormality , by which some optic nerves are routed to the wrong side of the brain , white tigers have a problem with spatial orientation , and bump into things until they learn to compensate .
Some tigers compensate by crossing their eyes .
When the neurons pass from the retina to the brain and reach the optic chiasma , some cross and some do not , so that visual images are projected to the wrong hemisphere of the brain .
White tigers can not see as well as normal tigers and suffer from photophobia , like albinos .
Other genetic problems include shortened tendons of the forelegs , club foot , kidney problems , arched or crooked backbone and twisted neck .
Reduced fertility and miscarriages , noted by " tiger man " Kailash Sankhala in pure - Bengal white tigers , were attributed to inbreeding depression .
A condition known as " star - gazing " ( the head and neck are raised almost straight up , as if the affected animal is gazing at the stars ) , which is associated with inbreeding in big cats , has also been reported in white tigers .
Some white tigers born to North American lines have bulldog faces with a snub nose , jutting jaw , domed head and wide - set eyes with an indentation between the eyes .
However , some of these traits may be linked to poor diet rather than inbreeding .
There was a male cross - eyed white tiger at the Pana'ewa Rainforest Zoo in Hawaii , which was donated to the zoo by Las Vegas magician Dirk Arthur .
There is a picture of a white tiger which appears to be cross - eyed on just one side in Siegfried & Roy 's book Mastering The Impossible .
A white tiger , named Scarlett O'Hara , who was Tony 's sister , was cross - eyed only on the right side .
A male tiger named ' Cheytan ' , a son of Bhim and Sumita who was born at the Cincinnati Zoo , died at the San Antonio Zoo in 1992 , from anaesthesia complications during root canal therapy .
It appears that white tigers also react strangely to anaesthesia .
The best drug for immobilizing a tiger is CI 744 , but a few tigers , white ones in particular , undergo a re - sedation effect 24–36 hours later .
This is due to their inability to produce normal tyrosinase , a trait they share with albinos , according to zoo veterinarian David Taylor .
He treated a pair of white tigers from the Cincinnati Zoo at Fritz Wurm 's safari park in Stukenbrock , Germany , for salmonella poisoning , which reacted strangely to the anaesthesia .
Mohini was checked for Chédiak - Higashi syndrome in 1960 , but the results were inconclusive .
This condition is similar to albino mutations and causes bluish lightening of the fur color , crossed eyes , and prolonged bleeding after surgery .
Also , in the event of an injury , the blood is slow to coagulate .
This condition has been observed in domestic cats , but there has never been a case of a white tiger having Chédiak - Higashi syndrome .
There has been a single case of a white tiger having central retinal degeneration , reported from the Milwaukee County Zoo , which could be related to reduced pigmentation in the eye .
The white tiger in question was a male named Mota on loan from the Cincinnati Zoo .
There is a myth that white tigers have an 80 % infant mortality rate .
However , the infant mortality rate for white tigers is no higher than it is for normal orange tigers bred in captivity .
Cincinnati Zoo director Ed Maruska said : " We have not experienced premature death among our white tigers .
Forty - two animals born in our collection are still alive .
Mohan , a large white tiger , died just short of his 20th birthday , an enviable age for a male of any subspecies , since most males live shorter captive lives .
Premature deaths in other collections may be artifacts of captive environmental conditions ...
in 52 births we had four stillbirths , one of which was an unexplained loss .
We lost two additional cubs from viral pneumonia , which is not excessive .
Without data from non - inbred tiger lines , it is difficult to determine whether this number is high or low with any degree of accuracy .
"
Ed Maruska also addressed the issue of deformities : " Other than a case of hip dysplasia that occurred in a male white tiger , we have not encountered any other body deformities or any physiological or neurological disorders .
Some of these reported maladies in mutant tigers in other collections may be a direct result of inbreeding or improper rearing management of tigers generally . "
INBREEDING AND OUTCROSSING Section::::Inbreeding and outcrossing .
Because of the extreme rarity of the white tiger allele in the wild , the breeding pool was limited to the small number of white tigers in captivity .
According to Kailash Sankhala , the last white tiger ever seen in the wild was shot in 1958 .
Today there is a large number of white tigers in captivity .
A white Amur tiger may have been born at Center Hill and has given rise to a strain of white Amur tigers .
A man named Robert Baudy realized that his tigers had white genes when a tiger he sold to Marwell Zoo in England developed white spots , and bred them accordingly .
The Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa Bay has four of these white Amur tigers , descended from Robert Baudy 's stock .
It has also been possible to expand the white - gene pool by outcrossing white tigers with unrelated orange tigers and then using the cubs to produce more white tigers .
The white tigers Ranjit , Bharat , Priya and Bhim were all outcrossed , in some instances to more than one tiger .
Bharat was bred to an unrelated orange tiger named Jack from the San Francisco Zoo and had an orange daughter named Kanchana .
Bharat and Priya were also bred with an unrelated orange tiger from Knoxville Zoo , and Ranjit was bred to this tiger 's sister , also from Knoxville Zoo .
Bhim fathered several litters with an unrelated orange tigress named Kimanthi at the Cincinnati Zoo .
ankam Ranjeeth had several mates at the Omaha Zoo .
The last descendants of Bristol Zoo 's white tigers were a group of orange tigers from outcrosses which were bought by a Pakistani senator and shipped to Pakistan .
Rajiv , Pretoria Zoo 's white tiger , who was born in the Cincinnati Zoo , was also outcrossed and sired at least two litters of orange cubs at Pretoria Zoo .
Outcrossing is not necessarily done with the intent of producing more white cubs by resuming inbreeding further down the line .
Outcrossing is a way of bringing fresh blood into the white strain .
The New Delhi Zoo loaned out white tigers to some of India 's better zoos for outcrossing , and the government had to impose a whip to force zoos to return either the white tigers or their orange offspring .
Siegfried & Roy performed at least one outcross .
In the mid-1980s they offered to work with the Indian government in the creation of a healthier strain of white tigers .
The Indian government reportedly considered the offer ; however , India had a moratorium on breeding white tigers after cubs were born at New Delhi Zoo with arched backs and clubbed feet , necessitating euthanasia .
Siegfried & Roy have bred white tigers in collaboration with the Nashville Zoo .
Because of the inbreeding and resulting genetic defects the Association of Zoos and Aquariums barred member zoos from breeding white tigers , white lions and king cheetahs in a white paper adopted by the board of directors in July 2011 .
It is noteworthy that the first person to speak out against the displaying of white tigers was William G. Conway , General Director of the New York Zoological Society , which later became known as the Wildlife Conservation Society when he said , " White tigers are freaks .
It 's not the role of a zoo to show two headed calves and white tigers . "
He warned AZA in 1983 of the harm to the zoo 's credibility in catering to the public 's fascination with freaks , but went unheeded until 2008 when AZA issued a request to their members to stop breeding white tigers and then later in July 2011 when the AZA formally adopted that stance as policy .
Conway was attacked by Ed Maruska of the Cincinnati Zoo for his observation , but in the end Conway 's belief was validated .
