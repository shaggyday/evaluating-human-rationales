MALACHITE GREEN Malachite green is an organic compound that is used as a dyestuff and controversially as an antimicrobial in aquaculture .
Malachite green is traditionally used as a dye for materials such as silk , leather , and paper .
Despite its name the dye is not prepared from the mineral malachite , and the name just comes from the similarity of color .
STRUCTURES AND PROPERTIES Section::::Structures and properties .
Malachite green is classified in the dyestuff industry as a triarylmethane dye and also using in pigment industry .
Formally , malachite green refers to the chloride salt [ CHC(CHN(CH))]Cl , although the term malachite green is used loosely and often just refers to the colored cation .
The oxalate salt is also marketed .
The anions have no effect on the color .
The intense green color of the cation results from a strong absorption band at 621 nm ( extinction coefficient of ) .
Malachite green is prepared by the condensation of benzaldehyde and dimethylaniline to give leuco malachite green ( LMG ) : Second , this colorless leuco compound , a relative of triphenylmethane , is oxidized to the cation that is MG :
A typical oxidizing agent is manganese dioxide .
Hydrolysis of MG gives an alcohol :
This alcohol is important because it , not MG , traverses cell membranes .
Once inside the cell , it is metabolized into LMG .
Only the cation MG is deeply colored , whereas the leuco and alcohol derivatives are not .
This difference arises because only the cationic form has extended pi - delocalization , which allows the molecule to absorb visible light .
PREPARATION Section::::Preparation .
The leuco form of malachite green was first prepared by Hermann Fischer in 1877 by condensing benzaldehyde and dimethylaniline in the molecular ratio 1:2 in the presence of sulfuric acid .
USES Section::::Uses .
Malachite green is traditionally used as a dye .
Kilotonnes of MG and related triarylmethane dyes are produced annually for this purpose .
MG is active against the oomycete Saprolegnia , which infects fish eggs in commercial aquaculture , MG has been used to treat Saprolegnia and is used as an antibacterial .
It is a very popular treatment against Ichthyophthirius multifiliis in freshwater aquaria .
The principal metabolite , LMG , is found in fish treated with malachite green , and this finding is the basis of controversy and government regulation .
See also Antimicrobials in aquaculture .
MG has frequently been used to catch thieves and pilferers .
The bait , usually money , is sprinkled with the anhydrous powder .
Anyone handling the contaminated money will find that on upon washing the hands , a green stain on the skin that lasts for several days will result .
NICHE USES Section::::Niche uses .
Numerous niche applications exploit the intense color of MG .
It is used as a biological stain for microscopic analysis of cell biology and tissue samples .
In the Gimenez staining method , basic fuchsin stains bacteria red or magenta , and malachite green is used as a blue - green counterstain .
Malachite green is also used in endospore staining , since it can directly stain endospores within bacterial cells ; here a safranin counterstain is often used .
Malachite green can also be used as a saturable absorber in dye lasers , or as a pH indicator between pH 0.2â€“1.8 .
However , this use is relatively rare .
Leuco - malachite green ( LMG ) is used as a detection method for latent blood in forensic science .
Hemoglobin catalyzes the reaction between LMG and hydrogen peroxide , converting the colorless LMG into malachite green .
Therefore , the appearance of a green color indicates the presence of blood .
REGULATION Section::::Regulation .
In 1992 , Canadian authorities determined that eating fish contaminated with malachite green posed a significant health risk .
Malachite green was classified a Class II Health Hazard .
Due to its low manufacturing cost , malachite green is still used in certain countries with less restrictive laws for non aquaculture purposes .
In 2005 , analysts in Hong Kong found traces of malachite green in eels and fish imported from China and Taiwan .
In 2006 , the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) detected malachite green in seafood imported from China , among others , where the substance is also banned for use in aquaculture .
In June 2007 , the FDA blocked the importation of several varieties of seafood due to continued malachite green contamination .
The substance has been banned in the United States since 1983 in food - related applications .
It is banned in the UK , also .
Animals metabolize malachite green to its leuco form .
Being lipophillic ( the leuco form has a log P of 5.70 ) , the metabolite is retained in catfish muscle longer ( HL = 10 days ) than is the parent molecule ( HL = 2.8 days ) .
TOXICITY Section::::Toxicity .
The ( oral , mouse ) is 80 mg / kg .
Rats fed malachite green experience " a dose - related increase in liver DNA adducts " along with lung adenomas .
Leucomalachite green causes an " increase in the number and severity of changes " .
As leucomalachite green is the primary metabolite of malachite green and is retained in fish muscle much longer , most human dietary intake of malachite green from eating fish would be in the leuco form .
During the experiment , rats were fed up to 543 ppm of leucomalachite green , an extreme amount compared to the average 5 ppb discovered in fish .
After a period of two years , an increase in lung adenomas in male rats was discovered but no incidences of liver tumors .
Therefore , it could be concluded that malachite green caused carcinogenic symptoms , but a direct link between malachite green and liver tumor was not established .
