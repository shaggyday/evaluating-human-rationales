ADULT ADOPTION Adult adoption is a form of adoption between 2 or more adults in order to transfer inheritance rights and/or filiation .
Adult adoption may be done for various reasons including : to establish intestate inheritance rights ; to formalize a step - parent / step - child relationship or a foster parent / foster child relationship ; or to restore the original legal relationship between adult adoptees and their natural families .
In Japan , adult adoption may be used in order to facilitate the continuance of a family business .
This form of adoption is known as mukoy≈çshi ( " son - in - law adoption " ) .
Adult adoption may also be used in some jurisdictions by same - sex couples in order to establish inheritance rights .
Depending on the laws of the jurisdiction , adult adoption may not be available as a legal option .
In the United Kingdom , only children may be adopted .
The Adoption and Children Act ( 2002 ) states , " An application for an adoption order may only be made if the person to be adopted has not attained the age of 18 years on the date of the application . "
In places where adult adoptions exist , it may or may not transfer filiation in addition to inheritance rights .
For example , in Colorado , one can adopt an adult of age 21 or older for inheritance purposes , but filiation will remain unaffected .
However , adoption of a person between the ages of 18 and 20 ( inclusive ) transfers both inheritance rights and filiation .
