MINI DISPLAYPORT
The Mini DisplayPort ( MiniDP or mDP ) is a miniaturized version of the DisplayPort audio - visual digital interface .
It was announced by Apple in October 2008 .
As of 2013 , all new Apple Macintosh computers had the port , as did the LED Cinema Display .
However , in 2016 Apple began phasing out the port and replacing it with the new USB - C connector .
The Mini DisplayPort is also fitted to some PC motherboards , and some PC notebooks from Asus , Microsoft , MSI , Lenovo , Toshiba , HP , Dell , and other manufacturers .
Unlike its Mini - DVI and Micro - DVI predecessors , the Mini DisplayPort can drive display devices with resolutions up to 2560×1600 ( WQXGA ) in its DisplayPort 1.1a implementation , and 4096×2160 ( 4 K ) in its DisplayPort 1.2 implementation .
With an adapter , the Mini DisplayPort can drive display devices with VGA , DVI , or HDMI interfaces .
Apple offers a free license for the Mini DisplayPort but they reserve the right to cancel the license
should the licensee " commence an action for patent infringement against Apple " .
COMPATIBILITY Section::::Compatibility .
Apple replaced the DVI port from the MacBook , MacBook Air , MacBook Pro , iMac , Mac Mini , and the Mac Pro with the Mini DisplayPort .
Its use as the video connector for the 24-inch Cinema Display may complicate compatibility :
* Mini DisplayPort 's HDCP extension disables playback of certain DRM - encrypted content on any display not designed for it .
This includes some content from the iTunes Store which has no such restrictions if played on a Mac without Mini DisplayPort .
* Apple 's Dual - Link DVI or VGA adapters are relatively large and expensive compared to past adapters , and customers have reported problems with them , such as being unable to connect to an external display .
Monitors connected to a Mini DisplayPort via these adaptors may have resolution problems or not " wake up " from sleep .
*
While the DisplayPort specification can support digital audio , the older 2009 line of MacBooks , MacBook Pros , and Mac Minis can not provide an audio signal through the Mini DisplayPort , and only do so over USB , Firewire , or the audio line out port .
( The April 2010 line of MacBook Pro , and July 2010 iMac and later do support this ) .
This can be a problem for users who want to connect their computers to HDTVs using a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter .
To work around this issue , some third - party manufacturers have created dual or triple - headed adapters that get power for the adapter from a USB port , video from the Mini DisplayPort , and audio from either the USB port or the optical - out port .
Either option terminates with a single female HDMI connector , thus allowing both video and audio to be channeled over the single HDMI cable .
