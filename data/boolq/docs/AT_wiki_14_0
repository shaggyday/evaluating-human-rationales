U.S. OPEN ( GOLF )
The United States Open Championship , commonly known as the U.S. Open , is the annual open national championship of golf in the United States .
It is the second of the four major championships in golf , and is on the official schedule of both the PGA Tour and the European Tour .
Since 1898 the competition has been 72 holes of stroke play ( 4 rounds on an 18-hole course ) , with the winner being the player with the lowest total number of strokes .
It is staged by the United States Golf Association ( USGA ) in mid - June , scheduled so that , if there are no weather delays , the final round is played on the third Sunday , which is Father 's Day .
The U.S. Open is staged at a variety of courses , set up in such a way that scoring is very difficult , with a premium placed on accurate driving .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The first U.S. Open was played on October 4 , 1895 , on a nine - hole course at the Newport Country Club in Newport , Rhode Island .
It was a 36-hole competition and was played in a single day .
Ten professionals and one amateur entered .
The winner was Horace Rawlins , a 21-year - old Englishman , who had arrived in the U.S. earlier that year to take up a position at the host club .
He received $ 150 cash out of a prize fund of $ 335 , plus a $ 50 gold medal ; his club received the Open Championship Cup trophy , which was presented by the USGA .
In the beginning , the tournament was dominated by experienced British players until 1911 , when John J. McDermott became the first native - born American winner .
American golfers soon began to win regularly and the tournament evolved to become one of the four majors .
Since 1911 , the title has been won mostly by players from the United States .
Since 1950 , players from only six countries other than the United States have won the championship , most notably South Africa , which has won five times since 1965 .
A streak of four consecutive non - American winners occurred from 2004 to 2007 for the first time since 1910 .
These four players , South African Retief Goosen ( 2004 ) , New Zealander Michael Campbell ( 2005 ) , Australian Geoff Ogilvy ( 2006 ) and Argentine Ángel Cabrera ( 2007 ) , are all from countries in the Southern Hemisphere .
Northern Ireland 's Graeme McDowell ( 2010 ) became the first European player to win the event since Tony Jacklin of England in 1970 ; three more Europeans won in the next four editions , making it only three American wins in the 11 tournaments from 2004 - 2014 .
U.S. Open play is characterized by tight scoring at or around par by the leaders , with the winner usually emerging at around even par .
A U.S. Open course is seldom beaten severely , and there have been many over - par wins ( in part because par is usually set at 70 , except for the very longest courses ) .
Normally , an Open course is quite long and will have a high cut of primary rough ( termed " Open rough " by the American press and fans ) ; undulating greens ( such as at Pinehurst No . 2 in 2005 , which was described by Johnny Miller of NBC as " like trying to hit a ball on top of a VW Beetle " ) ; pinched fairways ( especially on what are expected to be less difficult holes ) ; and two or three holes that are short par fives under regular play would be used as long par fours during the tournament ( often to meet that frequently used par of 70 , forcing players to have accurate long drives ) .
Some courses that are attempting to get into the rotation for the U.S. Open will undergo renovations to develop these features .
Rees Jones is the most notable of the " Open Doctors " who take on these projects ; his father Robert Trent Jones had filled that role earlier .
As with any professional golf tournament , the available space surrounding the course ( for spectators , among other considerations ) and local infrastructure also factor into deciding which courses will host the event .
QUALIFICATION Section::::Qualification .
The U.S. Open is open to any professional , or to any amateur with a USGA Handicap Index not exceeding 1.4 .
Players ( male or female ) may obtain a place by being fully exempt or by competing successfully in qualifying .
The field is 156 players .
About half of the field is made up of players who are fully exempt from qualifying .
The current exemption categories are : * Winners of the U.S. Open for the last ten years * Winner and runner - up from the previous year 's U.S. Amateur and winners of the previous year 's U.S. Junior Amateur and U.S. Mid - Amateur
* Winner of the previous year 's Amateur Championship * The previous year 's Mark H. McCormack Medal winner for the top - ranked amateur golfer in the world
* Winners of each of Masters Tournament , Open Championship and PGA Championship for the last five years
* Winners of the last three Players Championships * Winner of the current year 's BMW PGA Championship
* Winner of the last U.S.
Senior Open
*
In the year after the Olympic golf tournament , the reigning men 's gold medalist
* Top 10 finishers and ties from the previous year 's U.S. Open * Players who qualified for the previous year 's Tour Championship * The top 60 in the Official World Golf Ranking ( OWGR ) as of two weeks before the start of the tournament * The top 60 in the OWGR as of the tournament date
* Special exemptions selected by the USGA *
All remaining spots after the second top 60 OWGR cutoff date filled by alternates from qualifying tournaments .
The exemptions for amateurs apply only if the players remain amateurs as of the tournament date .
Before 2011 , the sole OWGR cutoff for entry was the top 50 as of two weeks before the tournament .
An exemption category for the top 50 as of the tournament date was added for 2011 , apparently in response to the phenomenon of golfers entering the top 50 between the original cutoff date and the tournament ( such as Justin Rose and Rickie Fowler in 2010 ) .
Through 2011 , exemptions existed for leading money winners on the PGA , European , Japanese , and Australasian tours , as well as winners of multiple PGA Tour events in the year before the U.S. Open .
These categories were eliminated in favor of inviting the top 60 on the OWGR at both relevant dates .
Starting with the 2012 championship , an exemption was added for the winner of the current year 's BMW PGA Championship , the European Tour 's equivalent of The Players Championship .
Potential competitors who are not fully exempt must enter the Qualifying process , which has two stages .
Firstly there is Local Qualifying , which is played over 18 holes at more than 100 courses around the United States .
Many leading players are exempt from this first stage , and they join the successful local qualifiers at the Sectional Qualifying stage , which is played over 36 holes in one day at several sites in the U.S. , as well as one each in Europe and Japan .
There is no lower age limit and the youngest - ever qualifier was 14-year - old Andy Zhang of China , who qualified in 2012 after Paul Casey withdrew days before the tournament .
USGA SPECIAL EXEMPTIONS Section::::USGA special exemptions .
The USGA has granted a special exemption to 34 players 52 times since 1966 .
Players with multiple special exemptions include : Arnold Palmer ( 1978 , 1980 , 1981 , 1983 , 1994 ) , Seve Ballesteros ( 1978 , 1994 ) , Gary Player ( 1981 , 1983 ) , Lee Trevino ( 1983 , 1984 ) , Hale Irwin ( 1990 , 2002 , 2003 ) , Jack Nicklaus ( 1991 , 1993 , 1995 , 1996 , 1997 , 1998 , 1999 , 2000 ) , Tom Watson ( 1993 , 1996 , 2000 , 2003 , 2010 ) .
Irwin won the 1990 U.S. Open after accepting a special exemption .
In the 2016 , a special exemption was extended to former champion Retief Goosen ( 2001 , 2004 ) .
In 2018 , a special exemption was extended to former U.S. Open champions Jim Furyk ( 2003 ) and Ernie Els ( 1994 , 1997 ) .
PRIZES
Section::::Prizes .
The purse at the 2017 U.S. Open was $ 12 million , and the winner 's share was $ 2.16 million .
The European Tour uses conversion rates at the time of the tournament to calculate the official prize money used in their Race to Dubai ( € 10,745,927 in 2017 ) .
In line with the other majors , winning the U.S. Open gives a golfer several privileges that make his career much more secure if he is not already one of the elite players of the sport .
U.S. Open champions are automatically invited to play in the other three majors ( the Masters , The Open Championship ( British Open ) , and the PGA Championship ) for the next five years , as well as The Players Championship , and they are exempt from qualifying for the U.S. Open itself for 10 years .
Winners may also receive a five - year exemption on the PGA Tour , which is automatic for regular members .
Non - PGA Tour members who win the U.S. Open have the choice of joining the PGA Tour either within 60 days of winning , or prior to the beginning of any one of the next five tour seasons .
Finally , U.S. Open winners receive automatic invitations to three of the five senior majors once they turn 50 ; they receive a five - year invitation to the U.S. Senior Open and a lifetime invitation to the Senior PGA Championship and Senior British Open .
The top 10 finishers at the U.S. Open are fully exempt from qualifying for the following year 's Open , and the top four are automatically invited to the following season 's Masters .
PLAYOFF FORMAT Section::::Playoff format .
Up to 2017 , the U.S. Open retained a full 18-hole playoff the following day ( Monday ) .
If a tie existed after that fifth round , then the playoff continued as sudden - death on the 91st hole .
The U.S. Open advanced to sudden - death three times ( 1990 , 1994 , 2008 ) , most recently when Tiger Woods defeated Rocco Mediate on the first additional playoff hole in 2008 .
Before sudden - death was introduced in the 1950s , additional 18-hole rounds were played ( 1925 , 1939 , and 1946 ) to break the tie .
When the playoff was scheduled for 36 holes and ended in a tie , as in 1931 , a second 36-hole playoff was required .
Since 2018 , the USGA adopted a two - hole aggregate playoff format , after consulting fans , players and media partners .
Sudden death will still be played if the playoff ends tied .
CHAMPIONS
Section::::Champions .
Willie Anderson , Bobby Jones , Ben Hogan and Jack Nicklaus hold the record for the most U.S. Open victories , with four victories each .
