SQUARE NUMBER
In mathematics , a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer ; in other words , it is the product of some integer with itself .
For example , 9 is a square number , since it can be written as .
The usual notation for the square of a number is not the product , but the equivalent exponentiation , usually pronounced as " squared " .
The name square number comes from the name of the shape .
The unit of area is defined as the area of a unit square ( ) .
Hence , a square with side length has area .
Square numbers are non - negative .
Another way of saying that a ( non - negative ) integer is a square number is that its square root is again an integer .
For example , = 3 , so 9 is a square number .
A positive integer that has no perfect square divisors except 1 is called square - free .
For a non - negative integer , the th square number is , with being the zeroth one .
The concept of square can be extended to some other number systems .
If rational numbers are included , then a square is the ratio of two square integers , and , conversely , the ratio of two square integers is a square , e.g. , formula_1 .
Starting with 1 , there are square numbers up to and including , where the expression represents the floor of the number .
EXAMPLES Section::::Examples .
The squares smaller than 60 = 3600 are : The difference between any perfect square and its predecessor is given by the identity .
Equivalently , it is possible to count up square numbers by adding together the last square , the last square 's root , and the current root , that is , .
PROPERTIES Section::::Properties .
The number is a square number if and only if one can arrange points in a square :
The expression for the th square number is .
This is also equal to the sum of the first odd numbers as can be seen in the above pictures , where a square results from the previous one by adding an odd number of points ( shown in magenta ) .
The formula follows : So for example , .
There are several recursive methods for computing square numbers .
For example , the th square number can be computed from the previous square by .
Alternatively , the th square number can be calculated from the previous two by doubling the th square , subtracting the th square number , and adding 2 , because .
For example , One number less than a square ( m - 1 ) is always the product of - 1 and + 1 ( e.g. 8 × 6 equals 48 , while 7 equals 49 ) .
Thus , 3 is the only prime number one less than a square .
A square number is also the sum of two consecutive triangular numbers .
The sum of two consecutive square numbers is a centered square number .
Every odd square is also a centered octagonal number .
Another property of a square number is that ( except 0 ) it has an odd number of positive divisors , while other natural numbers have an even number of positive divisors .
An integer root is the only divisor that pairs up with itself to yield the square number , while other divisors come in pairs .
Lagrange 's four - square theorem states that any positive integer can be written as the sum of four or fewer perfect squares .
Three squares are not sufficient for numbers of the form .
A positive integer can be represented as a sum of two squares precisely if its prime factorization contains no odd powers of primes of the form .
This is generalized by Waring 's problem .
In base 10 , a square number can end only with digits 0 , 1 , 4 , 5 , 6 or 9 , as follows : * if the last digit of a number is 0 , its square ends in 0 ( in fact , the last two digits must be 00 ) ; * if the last digit of a number is 1 or 9 ,
its square ends in 1 ;
* if the last digit of a number is 2 or 8 , its square ends in 4 ; * if the last digit of a number is 3 or 7 ,
its square ends in 9 ;
* if the last digit of a number is 4 or 6 , its square ends in 6 ; and *
if the last digit of a number is 5 , its square ends in 5 ( in fact , the last two digits must be 25 ) .
In base 12 , a square number can end only with square digits ( like in base 12 , a prime number can end only with prime digits or 1 ) , i.e. 0 , 1 , 4 or 9 , as follows : * if a number is divisible both by 2 and by 3
( i.e. divisible by 6 ) , its square ends in 0 ;
* if a number is divisible neither by 2 nor by 3 , its square ends in 1 ; * if a number is divisible by 2 , but not by 3 , its square ends in 4 ; and *
if a number is not divisible by 2 , but by 3 , its square ends in 9 .
Similar rules can be given for other bases , or for earlier digits ( the tens instead of the units digit , for example ) .
All such rules can be proved by checking a fixed number of cases and using modular arithmetic .
In general , if a prime divides a square number then the square of must also divide ; if fails to divide , then is definitely not square .
Repeating the divisions of the previous sentence , one concludes that every prime must divide a given perfect square an even number of times ( including possibly 0 times ) .
Thus , the number is a square number if and only if , in its canonical representation , all exponents are even .
Squarity testing can be used as alternative way in factorization of large numbers .
Instead of testing for divisibility , test for squarity : for given and some number , if is the square of an integer then divides .
( This is an application of the factorization of a difference of two squares . )
For example , is the square of 3 , so consequently divides 9991 .
This test is deterministic for odd divisors in the range from to where covers some range of natural numbers .
A square number can not be a perfect number .
The sum of the n first square numbers is The first values of these sums , the square pyramidal numbers , are : 0 , 1 , 5 , 14 , 30 , 55 , 91 , 140 , 204 , 285 , 385 , 506 , 650 , 819 , 1015 , 1240 , 1496 , 1785 , 2109 , 2470 , 2870 , 3311 , 3795 , 4324 , 4900 , 5525 , 6201 ...
The sum of the first odd integers , beginning with one , is a perfect square .
1 , 1 + 3 , 1 + 3 + 5 , 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 , etc .
The sum of the n first cubes is the square of the sum of the n first positive integers ; this is Nicomachus 's theorem .
All fourth powers , sixth powers , eighth powers and so on are perfect squares .
SPECIAL CASES
*
If the number is of the form where represents the preceding digits , its square is where and represents digits before 25 .
For example , the square of 65 can be calculated by which makes the square equal to 4225 .
*
If the number is of the form where represents the preceding digits , its square is where .
For example , the square of 70 is 4900 .
*
If the number has two digits and is of the form where represents the units digit , its square is where and .
Example :
To calculate the square of 57 , 25 + 7 = 32 and 7 = 49 , which means 57 = 3249 .
* If the number ends in 5 , its square will end in 5 ; similarly for ending in 25 , 625 , 0625 , 90625 , ... 8212890625 , etc .
If the number ends in 6 , its square will end in 6 , similarly for ending in 76 , 376 , 9376 , 09376 , ... 1787109376 .
For example , the square of 55376 is 3066501376 , both ending in 376 .
( The numbers 5 , 6 , 25 , 76 , etc . are called automorphic numbers .
They are sequence A003226 in the OEIS )
ODD AND EVEN SQUARE NUMBERS Section::::Odd and even square numbers .
Squares of even numbers are even ( and in fact divisible by 4 ) , since .
Squares of odd numbers are odd , since .
It follows that square roots of even square numbers are even , and square roots of odd square numbers are odd .
As all even square numbers are divisible by 4 , the even numbers of the form are not square numbers .
As all odd square numbers are of the form , the odd numbers of the form are not square numbers .
Squares of odd numbers are of the form , since and is an even number .
Every odd perfect square is a centered octagonal number .
The difference between any two odd perfect squares is a multiple of 8 .
The difference between 1 and any higher odd perfect square always is eight times a triangular number , while the difference between 9 and any higher odd perfect square is eight times a triangular number minus eight .
Since all triangular numbers have an odd factor , but no two values of differ by an amount containing an odd factor , the only perfect square of the form is 1 , and the only perfect square of the form is 9 .
