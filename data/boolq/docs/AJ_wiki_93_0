PERIOD ( PERIODIC TABLE )
A period in the periodic table is a horizontal row .
All elements in a row have the same number of electron shells .
Each next element in a period has one more proton and is less metallic than its predecessor .
Arranged this way , groups of elements in the same column have similar chemical and physical properties , reflecting the periodic law .
For example , the alkali metals lie in the first column ( group 1 ) and share similar properties , such as high reactivity and the tendency to lose one electron to arrive at a noble - gas electronic configuration .
As of 2016 , a total of 118 elements have been discovered and confirmed .
Modern quantum mechanics explains these periodic trends in properties in terms of electron shells .
As atomic number increases , shells fill with electrons in approximately the order shown at right .
The filling of each shell corresponds to a row in the table .
In the s - block and p - block of the periodic table , elements within the same period generally do not exhibit trends and similarities in properties ( vertical trends down groups are more significant ) .
However , in the d - block , trends across periods become significant , and in the f - block elements show a high degree of similarity across periods .
PERIODS Section::::Periods .
Seven periods of elements occur naturally on Earth .
For period 8 , which includes elements which may be synthesized after 2016 , see the extended periodic table .
A group in chemistry means a family of objects with similarities like different families .
There are 7 periods , going horizontally across the periodic table .
PERIOD 1
Section::::Period 1 . !
Group !

Name
The first period contains the least elements than any other , with only two , hydrogen and helium .
They therefore do not follow the octet rule .
Chemically , helium behaves like a noble gas , and thus is taken to be part of the group 18 elements .
However , in terms of its nuclear structure it belongs to the s block , and is therefore sometimes classified as a group 2 element , or simultaneously both 2 and 18 .
Hydrogen readily loses and gains an electron , and so behaves chemically as both a group 1 and a group 17 element .
* Hydrogen ( H ) is the most abundant of the chemical elements , constituting roughly 75 % of the universe 's elemental mass .
Ionized hydrogen is just a proton .
Stars in the main sequence are mainly composed of hydrogen in its plasma state .
Elemental hydrogen is relatively rare on Earth , and is industrially produced from hydrocarbons such as methane .
Hydrogen can form compounds with most elements and is present in water and most organic compounds .
* Helium ( He ) exists only as a gas except in extreme conditions .
It is the second - lightest element and is the second - most abundant in the universe .
Most helium was formed during the Big Bang , but new helium is created through nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars .
On Earth , helium is relatively rare , only occurring as a byproduct of the natural decay of some radioactive elements .
Such ' radiogenic ' helium is trapped within natural gas in concentrations of up to seven percent by volume .

Name Period 2 elements involve the 2s and 2p orbitals .
They include the biologically most essential elements besides hydrogen : carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen .
* Lithium ( Li ) is the lightest metal and the least dense solid element .
In its non - ionized state it is one of the most reactive elements , and so is only ever found naturally in compounds .
It is the heaviest primordial element forged in large quantities during the Big Bang .
* Beryllium ( Be ) has one of the highest melting points of all the light metals .
Small amounts of beryllium were synthesised during the Big Bang , although most of it decayed or reacted further within stars to create larger nuclei , like carbon , nitrogen or oxygen .
Beryllium is classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a group 1 carcinogen .
Between 1 % and 15 % of people are sensitive to beryllium and may develop an inflammatory reaction in their respiratory system and skin , called chronic beryllium disease .
* Boron ( B ) does not occur naturally as a free element , but in compounds such as borates .
It is an essential plant micronutrient , required for cell wall strength and development , cell division , seed and fruit development , sugar transport and hormone development , though high levels are toxic .
* Carbon ( C ) is the fourth - most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen , helium and oxygen and is the second - most abundant element in the human body by mass after oxygen , the third - most abundant by number of atoms .
There are an almost infinite number of compounds that contain carbon due to carbon 's ability to form long stable chains of C â€” C bonds .
All organic compounds , those essential for life , contain at least one atom of carbon ; combined with hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , sulfur , and phosphorus , carbon is the basis of every important biological compound .
* Nitrogen ( N ) is found mainly as mostly inert diatomic gas , N , which makes up 78 % of the Earth 's atmosphere by volume .
It is an essential component of proteins and therefore of life .
* Oxygen ( O ) comprising 21 % of the atmosphere by volume and is required for respiration by all ( or nearly all ) animals , as well as being the principal component of water .
Oxygen is the third - most abundant element in the universe , and oxygen compounds dominate the Earth 's crust .
* Fluorine ( F ) is the most reactive element in its non - ionized state , and so is never found that way in nature .
*
Neon ( Ne ) is a noble gas used in neon lighting .

Name
All period three elements occur in nature and have at least one stable isotope .
All but the noble gas argon are essential to basic geology and biology .
* Sodium ( Na ) is an alkali metal .
It is present in Earth 's oceans in large quantities in the form of sodium chloride ( table salt ) .
* Magnesium ( Mg ) is an alkaline earth metal .
Magnesium ions are found in chlorophyll .
* Aluminium ( Al ) is a post - transition metal .
It is the most abundant metal in the Earth 's crust .
* Silicon ( Si ) is a metalloid .
It is a semiconductor , making it the principal component in many integrated circuits .
Silicon dioxide is the principal constituent of sand .
As Carbon is to Biology , Silicon is to Geology .
* Phosphorus ( P ) is a nonmetal essential to DNA .
It is highly reactive , and as such is never found in nature as a free element .
* Sulfur ( S ) is a nonmetal .
It is found in two amino acids : cysteine and methionine .
* Chlorine ( Cl ) is a halogen .
It is used as a disinfectant , especially in swimming pools .
*
Argon ( Ar ) is a noble gas , making it almost entirely nonreactive .
Incandescent lamps are often filled with noble gases such as argon in order to preserve the filaments at high temperatures .

Name Period 4 includes the biologically essential elements potassium and calcium , and is the first period in the d - block with the lighter transition metals .
These include iron , the heaviest element forged in main - sequence stars and a principal component of the Earth , as well as other important metals such as cobalt , nickel , and copper .
Almost all have biological roles .
Completing the fourth period are the post - transition metals zinc and gallium , the metalloids germanium and arsenic , and the nonmetals selenium , bromine , and krypton . PERIOD 5 Section::::Period 5 . !

Name
All elements of period 7 are radioactive .
This period contains the heaviest element which occurs naturally on Earth , plutonium .
All of the subsequent elements in the period have been synthesized artificially .
Whilst five of these ( from americium to einsteinium ) are now available in macroscopic quantities , most are extremely rare , having only been prepared in microgram amounts or less .
Some of the later elements have only ever been identified in laboratories in quantities of a few atoms at a time .
Although the rarity of many of these elements means that experimental results are not very extensive , periodic and group trends in behaviour appear to be less well defined for period 7 than for other periods .
Whilst francium and radium do show typical properties of groups 1 and 2 , respectively , the actinides display a much greater variety of behaviour and oxidation states than the lanthanides .
These peculiarities of period 7 may be due to a variety of factors , including a large degree of spin - orbit coupling and relativistic effects , ultimately caused by the very high positive electrical charge from their massive atomic nuclei .
PERIOD 8 Section::::Period 8 .
No element of the eighth period has yet been synthesized .
A g - block is predicted .
It is not clear if all elements predicted for the eighth period are in fact physically possible .
There may therefore be no eighth period .
