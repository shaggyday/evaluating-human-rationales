EAST ANGLIA East Anglia is a geographical area in the East of England .
The area included has varied but the legally defined NUTS 2 statistical unit comprises the counties of Norfolk , Suffolk and Cambridgeshire , including the City of Peterborough unitary authority area .
The name derives from the Anglo - Saxon kingdom of the East Angles , a tribe whose name originated in Anglia , northern Germany .
AREA Section::::Area .
Definitions of what constitutes East Anglia vary .
The Anglo - Saxon Kingdom of East Anglia , established in the 6th century , originally consisted of the modern counties of Norfolk and Suffolk and expanded west into at least part of Cambridgeshire .
The modern NUTS 2 statistical unit of East Anglia comprises Norfolk , Suffolk and Cambridgeshire ( including the City of Peterborough unitary authority ) .
Those three counties have formed the Roman Catholic Diocese of East Anglia since 1976 , and were the subject of a possible government devolution package in 2016 .
Essex has sometimes been included in definitions of East Anglia , including by the London Society of East Anglians .
However , the Kingdom of Essex to the south , was a separate element of the Heptarchy of Anglo - Saxon England and did not identify as Angles but Saxons .
The county of Essex by itself forms a NUTS 2 statistical unit in the East of England region .
Other definitions of the area have been used or proposed over the years .
For example , the Redcliffe - Maud Report in 1969 , which followed the Royal Commission on the Reform of Local Government , recommended the creation of eight provinces in England .
The proposed East Anglia province would have included northern Essex , southern Lincolnshire and a small part of Northamptonshire as well as Cambridgeshire , Norfolk and Suffolk .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The kingdom of East Anglia initially consisted of Norfolk and Suffolk , but upon the marriage of the East Anglian princess Etheldreda , the Isle of Ely also became part of the kingdom .
The kingdom was formed about the year 520 by the merging of the North and the South Folk ( Angles who had settled in the former lands of the Iceni during the previous century ) and was one of the seven Anglo - Saxon heptarchy kingdoms ( as defined in the 12th century writings of Henry of Huntingdon ) .
For a brief period following a victory over the rival kingdom of Northumbria around the year 616 , East Anglia was the most powerful of the Anglo - Saxon kingdoms of England , and its King Raedwald was Bretwalda ( overlord of the Anglo - Saxons kingdoms ) .
However , this did not last and over the next forty years East Anglia was defeated by the Mercians twice and continued to weaken in relation to the other kingdoms .
Finally , in 794 , Offa of Mercia had king Æthelberht killed and took control of the kingdom himself .
Although independence was temporarily restored by rebellion in 825 , on 20 November 869 the Danes killed King Edmund and captured the kingdom ( see Ivar the Boneless ) .
By 917 , after a succession of Danish defeats , East Anglia was incorporated into the Kingdom of England by Edward the Elder , afterwards becoming an earldom .
Despite some engineering work in the form of sea barriers constructed by the Roman Empire , much of East Anglia remained marshland and bogs until the 17th century .
From this point onward a series of systematic drainage projects , mainly using drains and river diversions along the lines of Dutch practice , converted the alluvial land into wide swathes of productive arable land .
In the 1630s thousands of Puritan families from East Anglia settled in the American region of New England , taking much East Anglian culture with them that can still be traced today .
East Anglia , which based much of its earnings on wool , textiles , and arable farming , was a rich area of England until the effects of the Industrial Revolution saw manufacturing and development shift to the Midlands and the North .
During the Second World War , the Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces constructed many airbases in East Anglia for the heavy bomber fleets of the Combined Bomber Offensive against Nazi - occupied Europe .
East Anglia was ideally suited to airfield construction as it comprises large areas of open , level terrain and is close to mainland Europe .
The reduced flight time to mainland Europe therefore reduced the fuel load required and enabled a larger bomb load to be carried .
Building the airfields was a massive civil engineering project and by the end of the war there was one approximately every 8 miles .
Many of these airfields can still be seen today , particularly from aerial photographs , and a few remain in use today , the most prominent being Norwich International Airport .
Pillboxes , which were erected in 1940 to help defend the nation against invasion , can also be found throughout the area at strategic points .
GEOGRAPHY
Section::::Geography .
East Anglia is bordered to the north and east by the North Sea , to the south by the estuary of the River Thames and shares an undefined land border to the west with the rest of England .
Much of northern East Anglia is flat , low - lying and marshy ( such as the Fens of Cambridgeshire and Norfolk ) , although the extensive drainage projects of the past centuries actually make this one of the driest areas in the UK .
Inland much of the rest of Suffolk and Norfolk is gently undulating , with glacial moraine ridges providing some areas of steeper areas relief .
The supposed flatness of the Norfolk landscape is noted in literature , such as Noël Coward 's Private Lives – " Very flat , Norfolk " .
On the north - west corner East Anglia is bordered by a bay known as The Wash , where owing to deposits of sediment and land reclamation , the coastline has altered markedly within historical times ; several towns once on the coast of the Wash ( notably King 's Lynn ) are now some distance inland .
Conversely , over to the east on the coast exposed to the North Sea
the coastline is subject to rapid erosion and has shifted inland significantly since historic times .
Major rivers include Suffolk 's Stour , running through country beloved of the painter John Constable , and the River Nene .
The River Cam is a tributary of the Great Ouse and gives its name to Cambridge , whilst Norwich sits on the River Yare and River Wensum .
The River Orwell flows through Ipswich and has its mouth , along with the Stour at Felixstowe .
The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads form a network of waterways between Norwich and the coast and are popular for recreational boating .
The Ouse flows into the Wash at King 's Lynn .
Major urban areas in East Anglia include the cities of Norwich , Cambridge and Peterborough , and the town of Ipswich .
Smaller towns and cities include Bury St Edmunds , Ely , Lowestoft , Great Yarmouth and King 's Lynn .
Much of the area is still rural in nature with many villages surrounded by agricultural land .
The landscape of Cambridgeshire and Norfolk has been heavily influenced by Dutch technology , from the use of red clay pantiles to the draining of the Fens .
CLIMATE Section::::Climate .
The climate of East Anglia is generally dry and mild .
Temperatures range from an average of 1–10 ° C in the winter to 12–22 ° C in the summer , although it is not uncommon for daily temperatures to fall and rise significantly outside these averages .
Although water plays a significant role in the Fenland and Broadland landscapes , the area is among the driest in the United Kingdom and during the summer months , tinder - dry conditions are frequently experienced , occasionally resulting in field and heath fires .
Many areas receive less than 700 mm of rainfall a year and this is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year .
Sunshine totals tend to be higher towards the coastal areas .
TRANSPORT Section::::Transport .
Transport in East Anglia consists of an extensive road and rail network .
Main A roads , such as the A12 and A47 link the area to the rest of the UK , and the A14 links the Midlands to the Port of Felixstowe .
This is the busiest container port in the UK , dealing with over 40 % of UK container traffic and a is a major gateway port into the country .
There is very little motorway within East Anglia .
Rail links include the Great Eastern Main Line from Norwich to London Liverpool Street and the West Anglia Main Line connecting Cambridge to London .
Sections of the East Coast Main Line run through the area and Peterborough is an important interchange on this line .
The area is linked to the Midlands and north - west England by rail and has a number of local rail services , such as the Bittern Line from Norwich to Sheringham .
East Anglia is ideal for cycling and National Cycle Route 1 passes through it .
Cambridge has the largest proportion of its residents in the UK cycling to work with 25 % commuting by bicycle .
The city is also home to the Cambridgeshire guided busway , which at 13.3 miles ( 21.4 km ) was the longest stretch of guided bus - way in the world when it opened in 2011 .
The only major commercial airport is Norwich Airport , although London Stansted Airport , the fourth busiest passenger airport in the UK , lies just south of Cambridge in north - west Essex .
UNIVERSITIES Section::::Universities .
The University of Cambridge , established at the start of the 13th century and in the town of the same name , is East Anglia 's best - known institution of higher learning , and is among the oldest and most famous universities in the world .
Other institutions include the University of East Anglia ( in Norwich ) , Norwich University of the Arts , Anglia Ruskin University ( based in Cambridge ) , University of Suffolk ( based in Ipswich ) and University Centre Peterborough .
ENTERPRISE ZONES Section::::Enterprise zones .
Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft Enterprise Zone , an enterprise zone initiated by New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership , was announced in 2011 and launched in April 2012 .
It includes six sites with a total area of , which have attracted a number of energy - related businesses .
The sites are Beacon Park and South Denes in Great Yarmouth , Mobbs Way , Riverside Road and South Lowestoft Industrial Estate in Lowestoft and Ellough Business Park in Ellough near Beccles .
There is also an enterprise zone in Cambridgeshire , Alconbury Enterprise Campus in Huntingdon .
SYMBOLS AND CULTURE Section::::Symbols and culture .
A shield of three golden crowns , placed two above one , on a blue background has been used as a symbol of East Anglia for centuries .
The coat of arms was ascribed by medieval heralds to the Anglo - Saxon Kingdom of East Anglia and the Wuffingas dynasty which ruled it .
The arms are effectively identical to the coat of arms of Sweden .
The three crowns appear , carved in stone , on the baptismal font ( c.1400 ) in the parish church of Saxmundham , and on the 15th century porch of Woolpit church , both in Suffolk .
They also appear in local heraldry and form part of the arms of the diocese of Ely and the arms of the borough of Bury St Edmunds , where the crowns are shown pierced with arrows to represent the martyrdom of Edmund the Martyr , the last king of East Anglia .
Other users of the arms include the former Isle of Ely County Council , the Borough of Colchester and the University of East Anglia .
The flag of Cambridgeshire ( adopted in 2015 ) includes the three gold crowns on a blue field .
The East Anglian flag as it is known today was proposed by George Henry Langham and adopted in 1902 by the London Society of East Anglians ( established in 1896 ) .
It superimposes the three crowns in a blue shield on a St George 's cross .
East Anglia features heavily in English literature , notably in Noël Coward 's Private Lives and the history of its waterways and drainage forms the backdrop to Graham Swift 's novel Waterland .
The area also figures in works by L.P. Hartley , Arthur Ransome and Dorothy L. Sayers , among many others .
TOURISM Section::::Tourism .
East Anglia has a wide range of holiday resorts that range from the traditional coastal towns of Felixstowe and Lowestoft in Suffolk and Great Yarmouth and Hunstanton in Norfolk , to small fishing villages like Aldeburgh and Southwold in Suffolk .
Other tourist attractions include historic towns and cities like Bury St Edmunds , Cambridge and Ely as well as areas such as Constable Country , the Broads and the North Norfolk coast .
