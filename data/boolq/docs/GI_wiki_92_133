GAMEPLAY
Section::::Gameplay .
Ape Escape is a platform game that is viewed from a third - person perspective .
Players traverse several different environments to advance through the game .
For most of the game , players control Spike â€” a boy tasked with pursuing and capturing the apes across time , preventing them from rewriting history .
Players use various gadgets to pursue and capture the apes , such as the Stun Club , used as an offensive measure against enemies , and the Time Net , used to capture apes and transport them to present day .
More gadgets become available as players progress through the game .
Players also control vehicles throughout the game , including a rubber raft , which allows travel over water , and the water net , which assists in traversing underwater .
The game 's controls are heavily centered around the analog sticks : the left stick is used to move players , while the right stick manipulates the various gadgets .
The apes are equipped with helmets , which feature a siren representing their alarm level : blue means relaxed , and unaware of the player characters ' presence ; yellow is alert ; and red indicates fully alarmed , resulting in attempting to escape or becoming hostile .
An ape 's personality can also be determined by the colour of shorts : yellow is standard , light blue means timid , and red represents aggressive .
Some apes are equipped with weaponry , allowing them to attack players , or binoculars that allow them to identify players from long distances .
Players are required to capture a specific amount of apes to clear a level ; remaining apes can be captured upon revisiting the level .
Should players take damage , they lose a life .
Players can recharge their health by collecting cookies .
Throughout the game , players can gather Specter Coins , which can be found in hidden locations in each stage .
Collecting enough Specter Coins unlocks three bonus mini - games : Ski Kidz Racing , a skiing game in which players race against opponents ; Galaxy Monkey , a shoot
'em up where players fight against aliens ; and Specter Boxing , a boxing game where players dodge and punch using the analog sticks .
PLOT Section::::Plot .
The story begins when Specter , a white - haired monkey who is well - known at his home in a monkey - themed amusement park , puts on an experimental Peak Point Helmet created by a Professor , which increases his intelligence beyond that of a regular monkey , but also twists his mind , turning him evil .
Imbued with this new power , Specter gives Pipo Helmets to all the monkeys in the park and sets them loose , having them take over the local laboratory where the Professor and his assistant Natalie ( Katie / Natsumi ) are currently building a time machine .
As Spike ( Kakeru ) and his best friend Jake ( Buzz / Hiroki ) arrive at the laboratory , they find themselves transported by Specter , along with all the other monkeys , to the various reaches of time .
Realizing that leaving the monkeys to their own devices could rewrite history in disastrous ways , the Professor tasks Spike with finding all of the monkeys scattered across time and sending them back to the present .
Spike must also face off against Specter , who has not only built himself an advanced Peak Point Helmet further increasing his own intelligence , but has also brainwashed Jake to his side .
After a lengthy series of captures and battles in segments of history ranging from the age of the dinosaurs , medieval times and present day , Spike is eventually able to capture all of the apes .
Spike chases Specter to his deranged theme park , where he is holding a recently captured Professor , Natalie , and his friend Jake .
Spike frees Jake of his mind control , and releases both the professor and Natalie , and goes on to find Specter in an alternative universe he calls the " Peak Point Matrix " .
Spike defeats Specter after a final battle , and he is captured and sent back to the zoo .
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Development .
The development of Ape Escape lasted approximately two - and - a - half years .
Shortly after the development team began conceiving the design and concept for Ape Escape , they attended a meeting regarding the development of the DualShock .
Intrigued by the potential of the controller , the team implemented its use in Ape Escape , making it the first video game to require the use of the DualShock for gameplay .
Conceptualizing the controls for the controller 's analog sticks was the greatest challenge for the team , and the controls underwent great testing prior to finalization .
The game 's music was composed by Soichi Terada .
After a game director listened to Terada 's track " Sumo Jungle " , he was given the opportunity to compose the music for Ape Escape .
The music changes in - game depending on the situation and level ; for example , should players act stealthily , the music alters slightly to give a mellow atmosphere .
Music from the game was included in Ape Escape Originape Soundtracks , published on November 18 , 2011 by Terada 's label Far East Recording .
The gameplay sound effects were designed by Masaaki Kaneko , while the sound effects in the cutscenes were provided by Masatoshi Mizumachi .
The English voice acting was recorded at Dubey Tunes Studios in San Francisco , California , with Sara Holihan and Hunter A. Pipes III serving as voice - over director and producer , respectively .
Ape Escape was officially announced in the April 1999 issue of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine .
A playable demonstration was integrated into the Jampack Summer ' 99 compilation CD released by PlayStation Underground .
A second playable demonstration was included on a promotional compilation disc released by Pizza Hut on November 14 , 1999 .
Promotions for the game were held on Cartoon Network during Sony 's winter holiday marketing campaign of 1999 .
A remake of the game , titled Ape Escape : On the Loose , was announced on May 11 , 2004 , during Sony 's press conference at the Electronic Entertainment Expo .
It was released as a launch title for the PlayStation Portable ( PSP ) on March 24 , 2005 .
