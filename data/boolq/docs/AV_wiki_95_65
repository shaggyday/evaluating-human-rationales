RELATIVE KEY
In music , relative keys are the major and minor scales that have the same key signatures .
A pair of major and minor scales sharing the same key signature are said to be in a relative relationship .
The relative minor of a particular major key , or the relative major of a minor key , is the key which has the same key signature but a different tonic ; this is as opposed to parallel minor or major , which shares the same tonic ( from the Latin relativus , itself from relatus , past participle of referre ) .
Relative keys are closely related keys , the keys between which most modulations occur , in that they differ by no more than one accidental ( none in the case of relative keys ) .
The minor key starts three semitones below its relative major ; for example , A minor is three semitones below its relative , C major .
For example , G major and E minor both have a single sharp in their key signature at F ; therefore , E minor is the relative minor of G major , and conversely G major is the relative major of E minor .
The tonic of the relative minor is the sixth scale degree of the major scale , while the tonic of the relative major is the third degree of the minor scale .
The relative relationship may be visualized through the circle of fifths .

A minor Though modulation from the minor to relative major is common in the Classical and Romantic periods , Donald Tovey criticizes the idea that the keys have much in common , stating that , " the so - called ' relative major ' is one of five equally direct relations to a minor tonic and the ' relative minor ' is one of five to a major tonic .
The [ most closely related ] minor mode of C [ major ] is not ...
A minor , but C minor . " TERMINOLOGY Section::::Terminology .
Confusingly , the term for " relative key " in German is Paralleltonart , while parallel key is Varianttonart .
Similar terminology is used in most Germanic and Slavic languages , but not Romance languages .
This is particularly confusing with the term parallel chord , which denotes chords derived from the relative key in English usage .
