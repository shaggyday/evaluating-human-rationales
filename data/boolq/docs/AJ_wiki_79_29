OTHER TERMS
Section::::Other terms .
While conterminous U.S. has the precise meaning of contiguous U.S. ( both adjectives meaning " sharing a common boundary " ) , other terms commonly used to describe the 48 contiguous states have a greater degree of ambiguity .
CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES Section::::Continental United States .
Because Alaska is also on the North American continent , the term continental United States would also include that state , so the term is sometimes qualified with the explicit inclusion or exclusion of Alaska to resolve any ambiguity .
The term was in use prior to the admission of Alaska and Hawaii as states of the United States and at that time usually excluded outlying territories of the United States .
However , even before Alaska became a state , it was sometimes included within the " Continental U.S. " CONUS AND OCONUS Section::::CONUS and OCONUS .
CONUS , a technical term used by the U.S. Department of Defense , General Services Administration , NOAA / National Weather Service , and others , has been defined both as the continental United States , and as the 48 contiguous states .
The District of Columbia is not always specifically mentioned as being part of CONUS .
OCONUS is derived from CONUS with O for outside added , thus referring to Outside of Continental United States ( OCONUS ) .
THE LOWER 48 Section::::The lower 48 .
The term lower 48 is also used to refer to the conterminous United States .
The National Geographic style guide recommends the use of contiguous or conterminous United States instead of lower 48 when the 48 states are meant , unless used in the context of Alaska .
ZONE OF THE INTERIOR Section::::Zone of the Interior .
During World War II , the first four numbered Air Forces of the USAAF were said to be assigned to the Zone of the Interior by the American military organizations of the time â€” the future states of Alaska and Hawaii , then each only territories of the Union , were respectively covered by the Eleventh Air Force and Seventh Air Force during WW II .
TERMS USED IN THE NON - CONTIGUOUS STATES Section::::Terms used in the non - contiguous states .
Both Alaskans and Hawaiians have unique labels for the contiguous United States because of their own locations relative to them .

Alaska became the 49th state of the United States on January 3 , 1959 .
Alaska is on the northwest end of the North American continent , but separated from the rest of the United States Pacific coast by the Canadian province of British Columbia .
In Alaska , given the ambiguity surrounding the usage of continental , the term " continental United States " is almost unheard of when referring to the contiguous 48 states .
Several other terms have been used over the years .
The term Lower 48 has , for many years , been a common Alaskan equivalent for " contiguous United States " ;
today , more Alaskans use the term " Outside " , though a few persons may use " Outside " to refer to any location not within Alaska .
