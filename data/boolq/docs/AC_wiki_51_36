KENTUCKY DERBY
The Kentucky Derby , is a horse race that is held annually in Louisville , Kentucky , United States , on the first Saturday in May , capping the two - week - long Kentucky Derby Festival .
The race is a Grade I stakes race for three - year - old Thoroughbreds at a distance of at Churchill Downs .
Colts and geldings carry and fillies .
The race is often called " The Run for the Roses " for the blanket of roses draped over the winner .
It is also known in the United States as " The Most Exciting Two Minutes In Sports " or " The Fastest Two Minutes in Sports " in reference to its approximate duration .
It is the first leg of the American Triple Crown and is followed by the Preakness Stakes , then the Belmont Stakes .
Unlike the Preakness and Belmont Stakes , which took hiatuses in 1891–1893 and 1911–1912 , respectively , the Kentucky Derby has been run every consecutive year since 1875 .
The Derby , Preakness and Belmont all were run even every year throughout both World Wars , when the Olympics and nearly all professional sports seasons were canceled , due to the fact that nearly all the athletes enlisted .
A horse must win all three races to win the Triple Crown .
In the 2015 listing of the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities ( IFHA ) , the Kentucky Derby tied with the Whitney Handicap as the top Grade 1 race in the United States outside the Breeders ' Cup races .
The attendance at the Kentucky Derby ranks first in North America and usually surpasses the attendance of all other stakes races including the Preakness Stakes , Belmont Stakes , and the Breeders ' Cup .
HISTORY Section::::History .
In 1872 , Col . Meriwether Lewis Clark , Jr. , grandson of William Clark of the Lewis and Clark expedition , traveled to England , visiting Epsom in Surrey where The Derby had been running annually since 1780 .
From there , Clark went on to Paris , France , where in 1863 , a group of racing enthusiasts had formed the French Jockey Club and had organized the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp , which at the time was the greatest race in France .
Returning home to Kentucky , Clark organized the Louisville Jockey Club for the purpose of raising money to build quality racing facilities just outside the city .
The track would soon become known as Churchill Downs , named for John and Henry Churchill , who provided the land for the racetrack .
Officially , the racetrack was incorporated as Churchill Downs in 1937 .
The Kentucky Derby was first run at 1 1/2 miles ( 12 furlongs ; 2.4 km ) the same distance as the Epsom Derby .
The distance was changed in 1896 to its current 1 1/4 miles ( 10 furlongs ; 2 km ) .
On May 17 , 1875 , in front of an estimated crowd of 10,000 people , a field of 15 three - year - old horses contested the first Derby .
Under jockey Oliver Lewis , a colt named Aristides , who was trained by future Hall of Famer Ansel Williamson , won the inaugural Derby .
Later that year , Lewis rode Aristides to a second - place finish in the Belmont Stakes .
Although the first race meeting proved a success , the track ran into financial difficulties and in 1894 the New Louisville Jockey Club was incorporated with new capitalization and improved facilities .
Despite this , the business floundered until 1902 when Col .
Matt Winn of Louisville put together a syndicate of businessmen to acquire the facility .
Under Winn , Churchill Downs prospered and the Kentucky Derby then became the preeminent stakes race for three - year - old thoroughbred horses in North America .
Thoroughbred owners began sending their successful Derby horses to compete later in the Preakness Stakes at the Pimlico Race Course , in Baltimore , Maryland , followed by the Belmont Stakes in Elmont , New York .
The three races offered large purses and in 1919 Sir Barton became the first horse to win all three races .
However , the term Triple Crown did n't come into use for another eleven years .
In 1930 , when Gallant Fox became the second horse to win all three races , sportswriter Charles Hatton brought the phrase into American usage .
Fueled by the media , public interest in the possibility of a " superhorse " that could win the Triple Crown began in the weeks leading up to the Derby .
Two years after the term was coined , the race , which had been run in mid - May since inception , was changed to the first Saturday in May to allow for a specific schedule for the Triple Crown races .
Since 1931 , the order of Triple Crown races has been the Kentucky Derby first , followed by the Preakness Stakes and then the Belmont Stakes .
Prior to 1931 , eleven times the Preakness was run before the Derby .
On May 12 , 1917 and again on May 13 , 1922 , the Preakness and the Derby were run on the same day .
On eleven occasions the Belmont Stakes was run before the Preakness Stakes .
On May 16 , 1925 , the first live radio broadcast of the Kentucky Derby was originated by WHAS and was also carried by WGN in Chicago .
On May 7 , 1949 , the first television coverage of the Kentucky Derby took place , produced by WAVE - TV , the NBC affiliate in Louisville .
This coverage was aired live in the Louisville market and sent to NBC as a kinescope newsreel recording for national broadcast .
On May 3 , 1952 , the first national television coverage of the Kentucky Derby took place , aired from then - CBS affiliate WHAS - TV .
In 1954 , the purse exceeded $ 100,000 for the first time .
In 1968 , Dancer 's Image became the first ( and to this day the only ) horse to win the race and then be disqualified after traces of phenylbutazone , an analgesic and anti - inflammatory drug , were found in the horse 's urinalysis ; Forward Pass won after a protracted legal battle by the owners of Dancer 's Image ( which they lost ) .
Forward Pass thus became the eighth winner for Calumet Farm .
Unexpectedly , the regulations at Kentucky thoroughbred race tracks were changed some years later , allowing horses to run on phenylbutazone .
In 1970 , Diane Crump became the first female jockey to ride in the Derby , finishing 15th aboard Fathom .
The fastest time ever run in the Derby was set in 1973 at 1:59.4 minutes when Secretariat broke the record set by Northern Dancer in 1964 .
Not only has Secretariat 's record time yet to be topped , in the race itself , he did something unique in Triple Crown races :
each successive quarter , his times were faster .
Though times for non - winners were not recorded , in 1973 Sham finished second , two and a half lengths behind Secretariat in the same race .
Using the thoroughbred racing convention of one length equaling one - fifth of a second to calculate Sham 's time , he also finished in under two minutes .
Another sub - two - minute finish , only the third , was set in 2001 by Monarchos at 1:59.97 .
In 2005 , the purse distribution for the Derby was changed , so that horses finishing fifth would henceforth receive a share of the purse ; previously only the first four finishers did so .
ATTENDANCE Section::::Attendance .
Since the Kentucky Derby is the biggest race in the world , millions of people from around the world bet at various live tracks and online sportsbooks .
In 2017 , a crowd of 158,070 watched Always Dreaming win the Derby , making it the seventh biggest attendance in the history of the racetrack .
The track reported a wagering total of $ 209.2 million from all the sources on all the races on the Kentucky Derby Day program .
It was a 9 percent increase compared to the total of $ 192.6 million in 2016 and an increase of 8 percent over the previous record set in 2015 of $ 194.3 million .
TwinSpires , a platform for betting online and a partner of the Kentucky Derby and the Breeders ' Cup , recorded $ 32.8 million in handle on the Churchill Down races for the Kentucky Derby Day program .
This was a 22 percent increase over the preceding year .
On the Kentucky Derby race alone , the handle of TwinSpires was $ 20.1 million , which is a 22 percent rise compared to the prior year .
The race often draws celebrities .
HM Queen Elizabeth II , on a visit to the United States , joined the racegoers at Churchill Downs in 2007 .
SPONSORSHIP Section::::Sponsorship .
The 2004 Derby marked the first time that jockeys — as a result of a court order — were allowed to wear corporate advertising logos on their clothing .
Norman Adams has been the designer of the Kentucky Derby Logo since 2002 .
On February 1 , 2006 , the Louisville - based fast - food company Yum !
Brands , Inc. announced a corporate sponsorship deal to call the race " The Kentucky Derby presented by Yum !
Brands .
" In 2018 , Woodford Reserve replaced Yum Brands as the presenting sponsor .
TRADITIONS Section::::Traditions .
In addition to the race itself , a number of traditions play a large role in the Derby atmosphere .
The mint julep — an iced drink consisting of bourbon , mint , and a sugar syrup — is the traditional beverage of the race .
The historic drink can be served in an ice - frosted silver julep cup , but most Churchill Downs patrons sip theirs from souvenir glasses ( first offered in 1939 and available in revised form each year since )
printed with all previous Derby winners .
Also , burgoo , a thick stew of beef , chicken , pork , and vegetables , is a popular Kentucky dish served at the Derby .
The infield — a spectator area inside the track — offers general admission prices but little chance of seeing much of the race , particularly prior to the jumbotron installation in 2014 .
Instead , revelers show up in the infield to party with abandon .
By contrast , " Millionaire 's Row " refers to the expensive box seats that attract the rich , the famous and the well - connected .
Women appear in fine outfits lavishly accessorized with large , elaborate hats .
Following the Call to the Post , as the horses are paraded before the grandstands , the University of Louisville Cardinal Marching Band plays Stephen Foster 's " My Old Kentucky Home , " a tradition which began in 1921 .
The event attracts spectators from a large area , flying in hundreds of private aircraft to Louisville International Airport .
The Derby is frequently referred to as " The Run for the Roses , " because a lush blanket of 554 red roses is awarded to the Kentucky Derby winner each year .
The tradition originated in 1883 when New York socialite E. Berry Wall presented roses to ladies at a post - Derby party that was attended by Churchill Downs founder and president , Col . M. Lewis Clark .
This gesture is believed to have led Clark to the idea of making the rose the race 's official flower .
However , it was not until 1896 that any recorded account referred to roses being draped on the Derby winner .
The Governor of Kentucky awards the garland and the Kentucky Derby Trophy .
Pop vocalist Dan Fogelberg composed the song " Run for the Roses " which was released in time for the 1980 running of the race .
RIDERS UP !
