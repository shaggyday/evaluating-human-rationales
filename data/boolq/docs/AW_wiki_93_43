PRODUCTION
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Production .
Section::::Development .
Warner Bros. purchased the film rights to The Phantom of the Opera in early 1989 , granting Andrew Lloyd Webber total artistic control .
Despite interest from A - list directors , Lloyd Webber and Warner Bros. instantly hired Joel Schumacher to direct ; Lloyd Webber had been impressed with Schumacher 's use of music in The Lost Boys .
The duo wrote the screenplay that same year , while Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman were cast to reprise their roles from the original stage production .
Filming was set to begin at Pinewood Studios in England in July 1990 , under a $ 25 million budget .
However , the start date was pushed to November 1990 at both Babelsberg Studios in Munich , Germany and Barrandov Studios in Prague , Czech Republic .
Production for The Phantom of the Opera was stalled with Lloyd Webber and Brightman 's divorce .
" Everything got tied up in settlements " , Schumacher reflected . "
Then my career took off and I was really busy . "
As a result , The Phantom of the Opera languished in development limbo for Warner Bros. throughout the 1990s .
In February 1997 , Schumacher considered returning , but eventually dropped out in favour of Batman Unchained , Runaway Jury and Dreamgirls .
The studio was keen to cast John Travolta for the lead role , but also held discussions with Antonio Banderas , who undertook vocal preparation and sang the role of the Phantom in the TV special Andrew Lloyd Webber : The Royal Albert Hall Celebration .
Schumacher and Lloyd Webber restarted development for The Phantom of the Opera in December 2002 .
It was then announced in January 2003 that Lloyd Webber 's Really Useful Group had purchased the film rights from Warner Bros. in an attempt to produce The Phantom of the Opera independently .
As a result , Lloyd Webber invested $ 6 million of his own money .
The Phantom of the Opera was produced on a $ 55 million budget .
A further $ 15 million was used for marketing , bringing the final budget to $ 70 million .
Warner Bros. was given a first look deal for distribution ; the studio did not sign on until June 2003 , when the principal cast was chosen .
CASTING
Section::::Casting .
Hugh Jackman was offered the chance to audition for the Phantom , but he faced scheduling conflicts with Van Helsing .
" They rang to ask about my availability " , Jackman explained in an April 2003 interview , " probably about 20 other actors as well .
I was n't available , unfortunately .
So , that was a bummer . "
" We needed somebody who has a bit of rock and roll sensibility in him " , Andrew Lloyd Webber explained .
" He 's got to be a bit rough , a bit dangerous ; not a conventional singer .
Christine is attracted to the Phantom because he 's the right side of danger . "
Director Joel Schumacher had been impressed with Gerard Butler 's performance in Dracula 2000 .
Prior to his audition , Butler had no professional singing experience and had only taken four voice lessons before singing " The Music of the Night " for Lloyd Webber .
Katie Holmes , who began working with a vocal coach , was the front - runner for Christine Daaé in March 2003 .
She was later replaced by Anne Hathaway , a classically trained soprano , in 2004 .
However , Hathaway dropped out of the role because the production schedule of the film overlapped with , which she was contractually obligated to make .
Hathaway was then replaced with Emmy Rossum .
The actress modeled the relationship between the Phantom and Christine after Suzanne Farrell and George Balanchine .
Patrick Wilson was cast as Raoul based on his previous Broadway theatre career .
For the role of Carlotta , Minnie Driver devised an over - the - top , camp performance as the egotistical prima donna .
Despite also lacking singing experience , Ciarán Hinds was cast by Schumacher as Richard Firmin ; the two had previously worked together on Veronica Guerin .
Ramin Karimloo also briefly appears as the portrait of Gustave Daaé , Christine 's father .
Karimloo later played the Phantom as well as the role of Raoul on London 's West End .
FILMING
Section::::Filming .
Principal photography lasted from 15 September 2003 to 15 January 2004 .
The film was shot entirely using eight sound stages at Pinewood Studios , where , on the Pinewood backlot , the bottom half exterior of the Palais Garnier was constructed .
The top half was implemented using a combination of computer - generated imagery ( CGI ) and a scale model created by Cinesite .
The surrounding Paris skyline for " All I Ask of You " was entirely composed of matte paintings .
Cinesite also created a miniature falling chandelier , since a life - size model was too big for the actual set .
Production designer Anthony D. G. Pratt was influenced by French architect Charles Garnier , designer of the original Paris opera house , as well as Edgar Degas , John Singer Sargent , Gustave Caillebotte , the Pre - Raphaelite Brotherhood and Dante Gabriel Rossetti .
Schumacher was inspired by Jean Cocteau 's Beauty and the Beast ( 1946 ) , where a hallway is lined with arms holding candelabra .
The cemetery was based on the Père Lachaise and Montparnasse .
Costume designer Alexandra Byrne utilised a limited black , white , gold and silver colour palette for the Masquerade ball .

CRITICAL RECEPTION Section::::Critical reception .
The film received mixed to negative reviews from film critics but received highly positive reviews from audiences .
Rotten Tomatoes gives it 32 % rotten with an average score of 5/10 .
" The music of the night has hit something of a sour note : Critics are calling the screen adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber 's popular musical histrionic , boring and lacking in both romance and danger " , the consensus read . "
Still , some have praised the film for its sheer spectacle " .
By comparison , Metacritic calculated an average score of 40/100 from its 39 reviews collected .
Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of " A " on an A+ to F scale , while it currently holds a 7.3/10 rating on IMDB .
Despite having been impressed with the cast , Jonathan Rosenbaum of Chicago Reader wrote that " Teen romance and operetta - style singing replace the horror elements familiar to film - goers , and director Joel Schumacher obscures any remnants of classy stage spectacle with the same disco overkill he brought to Batman Forever . "
Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com believed that Phantom of the Opera " takes everything that 's wrong with Broadway and puts it on the big screen in a gaudy splat . "
In a mixed review for Newsweek , David Ansen praised Rossum 's performance , but criticized the filmmakers for their focus on visual design rather than presenting a cohesive storyline . "
Its kitschy romanticism bored me on Broadway and it bores me here
— I may not be the most reliable witness .
Still , I can easily imagine a more dashing , charismatic Phantom than Butler 's .
Rest assured , however , Lloyd Webber 's neo - Puccinian songs are reprised and reprised and reprised until you 're guaranteed to go out humming . "
Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly believed Schumacher did not add enough dimension in adapting The Phantom of the Opera .
"
Schumacher , the man who added nipples to Batman 's suit , has staged Phantom chastely , as if his job were to adhere the audience to every note " .
Roger Ebert reasoned that " part of the pleasure of movie - going is pure spectacle — of just sitting there and looking at great stuff and knowing it looks terrific .
There was n't much Schumacher could have done with the story or the music he was handed , but in the areas over which he held sway , he has triumphed . "
In contrasting between the popularity of the Broadway musical , Michael Dequina of Film Threat magazine explained that " it conjures up this unexplainable spell that leaves audiences sad , sentimental , swooning , smiling — in some way transported and moved .
Now , in Schumacher 's film , that spell lives on . "
