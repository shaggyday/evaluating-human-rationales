PRACTICE SCOPE Section::::Practice .
Section::::Scope .
Veterinary chiropractors typically treat horses , racing greyhounds , and pets .
Some animal chiropractors perform adjusts on exotic animals such as birds , dolphins elephants , iguanas , turkeys , pigs , and llamas .
It has become a fast developing area .
A 2011 survey in New Zealand found that use of animal chiropractic on competition race horses is widespread .
CLINICAL
Section::::Clinical .
The American Veterinary Medical Association ( AVMA ) guidelines recommend that a veterinarian should examine an animal and establish a preliminary diagnosis before any alternative treatment , like chiropractic , is initiated .
Before performing a chiropractic adjustment , the chiropractor examines the animal 's gait , posture , and the vertebrae and extremities .
The chiropractor may also make neurological evaluations .
In addition to spinal manipulation , other adjustive procedures can be performed to the extremity joints and cranial sutures .
Those that specialize in horses are referred to as " equine chiropractors . "
The AVMA lists chiropractic as a complementary and alternative treatment ( CAVM ) .
Other CAVM treatments include acupuncture and physical therapy .
The AVMA Model Veterinary Practice Act includes CAVM in the definition of veterinary medicine , and that standard has been adopted in 20 states .
An additional 20 states have enacted other provisions regarding the use of CAVM on animals , most of which require some type of veterinary input such as supervision or referral .
Veterinary chiropractic is not recognized by the American Chiropractic Association as being chiropractic .
EFFICACY AND SAFETY Section::::Efficacy and safety .
Limited evidence exists on the efficacy of osteopathic or chiropractic methods in equine therapy .
There is limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of spinal manipulation or mobilization for equine pain management , and the efficacy of specific equine manual therapy techniques is mostly anecdotal .
Together , the American Animal Hospital Association and the American Association of Feline Practitioners stated in 2015 that there was insufficient " reliable , noncontradictory evidence " for veterinary chiropractic methods in the management of pain .
The practice remains controversial .
There is some degree of risk associated with even skilled manipulation in animals as the potential for injury exists with any technique used .
This risk may increase in the presence of structural disease , such as equine cervical vertebral malformation ( CVM ) or canine intervertebral disk disease .
Horses have been hurt by very forceful animal chiropractic movements .
Adjusting the spine of a dog with a degenerative disk runs the risk of serious injury to the spinal cord .
HISTORY AND CERTIFICATION Section::::History and certification .
Chiropractic treatment of large animals dates back to the early 1900s .
The founder of the field of chiropractic , spiritualist Daniel David Palmer used the method on animals , partly to challenge claims that the placebo effect was responsible for favorable results in humans .
In the 1980s , it began to be seen on the margins of veterinary medicine .
By the late 1980s , a veterinarian who also was a chiropractor , Sharon Willoughby , developed a training program .
With the emergence of veterinary chiropractic , both doctors of chiropractic ( DCs ) and veterinary medicine ( DVMs ) became able to take additional training to become certified in veterinary chiropractic .
The primary certifier in North America is The Animal Chiropractic Certification Commission ( ACCC ) of the American Veterinary Chiropractic Association ( AVCA ) .
Earning certification from the ACCC requires attending an ACCC - approved animal chiropractic program followed by ACCC written and clinical examinations .
In some locations , a veterinarian must supervise the treatment provided by a veterinary chiropractor .
