SEASON FINALE
A season finale
( British English : last in the series ; Australian English : season final ) is the final episode of a season of a television program .
This is often the final episode to be produced for a few months or longer , and , as such , will try to attract viewers to continue watching when the series begins again .
A season finale may contain a cliffhanger ending to be resolved in the next season .
Alternatively , a season finale could bring storylines to a close , " going out on a high " and similarly maintaining interest in the series ' eventual return .
MID - SEASON FINALE Section::::Mid - season finale .
In the 2000s , the terms " mid - season finale " , " fall finale " and " winter finale " began being used by some cable and broadcast networks in the United States to denote the last episode in the first half of a split television season .
Such a " finale " is ahead of a break in the broadcast schedule in order to make room for a mid - season replacement series , or it can simply demarcate the interregnum between November sweeps and the end of the Christmas / Hanukkah / New Year holiday period , when most regular programming is in hiatus .
SERIES FINALE
Section::::Series finale .
The final episode of a television series often concludes the entire premise of the show , wrapping up any loose ends and storylines .
On occasion , the season finale has become the series finale due to cancellation of the series , sometimes unexpectedly so , leaving plot points unresolved .
IN SPORTS Section::::In sports .
In American English , the term has evolved to describe the final event of a sporting season , e.g. in soccer or motocross , perhaps partly because of the popularity of these with television viewers .
