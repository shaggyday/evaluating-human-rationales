CHEEK
The cheeks ( ) constitute the area of the face below the eyes and between the nose and the left or right ear .
" Buccal " means relating to the cheek .
In humans , the region is innervated by the buccal nerve .
The area between the inside of the cheek and the teeth and gums is called the vestibule or buccal pouch or buccal cavity and forms part of the mouth .
In other animals the cheeks may also be referred to as jowls .
STRUCTURE
Section::::Structure .
Cheeks are fleshy in humans , the skin being suspended by the chin and the jaws , and forming the lateral wall of the human mouth , visibly touching the cheekbone below the eye .
The inside of the cheek is lined with a mucous membrane ( buccal mucosa , part of the oral mucosa ) .
During mastication ( chewing ) , the cheeks and tongue between them serve to keep the food between the teeth .
OTHER ANIMALS
Section::::Other animals .
The cheeks are covered externally by hairy skin , and internally by stratified squamous epithelium .
This is mostly smooth , but may have caudally directed papillae ( e.g. , in ruminants ) .
The mucosa is supplied with secretions from the Buccal glands , which are arranged in superior and inferior groups .
In carnivores , the superior buccal gland is large and discrete : the Zygomatic gland .
During mastication ( chewing ) , the cheeks and tongue between them serve to keep the food between the teeth .
Some animals such as squirrels and hamsters use the buccal pouch to carry food or other items .
In some vertebrates , markings on the cheek area , particularly immediately beneath the eye , often serve as important distinguishing features between species or individuals .
BUTTOCKS Section::::Buttocks .
Sometimes people refer to the buttocks as the " cheeks " , because of their semi - round appearance .
SOCIETY AND CULTURE Section::::Society and culture .
