MALAR RASH
In medicine , malar rash ( from Latin ' jaw , cheek - bone ' ) , also called butterfly rash , is a medical sign consisting of a characteristic form of facial rash .
It is often seen in lupus erythematosus but is not pathognomonic - it is also seen in other diseases such as pellagra , dermatomyositis , and Bloom syndrome .
The malar rash of lupus is red or purplish and mildly scaly .
Characteristically , it has the shape of a butterfly and involves the bridge of the nose .
Notably , the rash spares the nasolabial folds of the face , which contributes to its characteristic appearance .
It is usually macular with sharp edges and not itchy .
The rash can be transient or progressive with involvement of other parts of the facial skin .
A malar rash is present in approximately 46â€“65 % of lupus sufferers and varies between different populations .
There are numerous other conditions which can cause rashes with a similar appearance .
Where lupus is suspected , further medical tests ( usually an ANA as a screening test which is not specific for systemic lupus erythematosus ) and a detailed history and examination are necessary to differentiate it from other conditions .
