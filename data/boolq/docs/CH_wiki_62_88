NONVERBAL LEARNING DISORDER Nonverbal learning disorder ( also known as nonverbal learning disability , NLD , or NVLD ) is a learning disorder characterized by verbal strengths as well as visual - spatial , motor , and social skills difficulties .
It is sometimes confused with autism spectrum disorder .
Nonverbal learning disorder has never been included in the American Psychiatric Association 's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or the World Health Organization 's International Classification of Diseases .
OVERVIEW Section::::Overview .
Considered to be neurologically based , nonverbal learning disorder is characterized by verbal strengths as well as visual - spatial , motor , and social skills difficulties .
People with this disorder may not at times comprehend nonverbal cues such as facial expression or tone of voice .
Challenges with mathematics and handwriting are common .
While various nonverbal impairments were recognized since early studies in child neurology , there is ongoing debate as to whether /
or the extent to which existing conceptions of NLD provide a valid diagnostic framework .
As originally presented " nonverbal disabilities " ( p. 44 ) or " disorders of nonverbal learning " ( p. 272 ) was a category encompassing non - linguistic learning problems ( Johnson and Myklebust , 1967 ) .
" Nonverbal learning disabilities " were further discussed by Myklebust in 1975 as representing a subtype of learning disability with a range of presentations involving " mainly visual cognitive processing , " social imperception , a gap between higher verbal ability and lower performance IQ , as well as difficulty with handwriting .
Later neuropsychologist Byron Rourke sought to develop consistent criteria with a theory and model of brain functioning that would establish NLD as a distinct syndrome ( 1989 ) .
Questions remain about how best to frame the perceptual , cognitive and motor issues associated with NLD .
The DSM-5 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ) and ICD-10 ( International Classification of Diseases ) do not include NLD as a diagnosis .
Assorted diagnoses have been discussed as sharing symptoms with NLD — these conditions include Right hemisphere brain damage and Developmental Right Hemisphere Syndrome , Developmental Coordination Disorder , Social - Emotional Processing Disorder , autism spectrum disorders , Gerstmann syndrome and others .
Labels for specific associated issues include visual - spatial deficit , dyscalculia , dysgraphia , as well as dyspraxia .
In their 1967 book Learning Disabilities ; Educational Principles and Practices , Doris J. Johnson and Helmer R. Myklebust characterize how someone with these kinds of disabilities appears in a classroom : " An example is the child who fails to learn the meaning of the actions of others ...
We categorize this child as having a deficiency in social perception , meaning that he has an inability which precludes acquiring the significance of basic nonverbal aspects of daily living , though his verbal level of intelligence falls within or above the average . "

In their chapter " Nonverbal Disorders Of Learning " ( p. 272 - 306 ) are sections titled " Learning
Though Pictures , " ( 274 ) " Gesture , " ( 281 ) " Nonverbal Motor Learning , " ( 282 ) " Body Image , " ( 285 ) " Spatial Orientation , " ( 290 )
" Right - Left Orientation , " ( 292 ) " Social Imperception , " ( 295 ) " Distractibility , Perseveration , and Disinhibition . " ( 298 ) SEE ALSO * Autism spectrum * Pragmatic Language Impairment
