HEADLIGHT
FLASHING Headlight flashing is the act of either briefly switching on the headlights of a car , or of momentarily switching between a headlight 's high beams and low beams , in an effort to communicate with another driver or drivers .
The signal is sometimes referred to in car manufacturers ' manuals as an optical horn , since it draws the attention of other drivers .
The signal can be intended to convey a variety of messages , including a warning to other drivers of road hazards , telling a driver they can pass through or alerting a driver of speed traps , and it can also be a form of aggressive driving .
The legality of headlight flashing varies by jurisdiction .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Headlight flashing might have come into more common use as a means of attempting driver - to - driver communication by the mid-1970s , when cars began to come with headlight beam selectors located on the steering column — typically activated by pulling the turn signal stalk — rather than the previous foot - operated pushbutton switches .
The signal stalk configuration was later wired to permit the momentary activation of the high beams regardless of whether the headlamp switch was turned on or off .
USES Section::::Uses .
Headlight flashing attracts attention , and so can be considered the visual equivalent of blowing the horn .
Indeed , some car owner 's manuals identify headlight control on the steering column as the " optical horn " .
Like the horn , it has many uses .
Headlight flashing can let other drivers know of one 's presence .
Flashing can acknowledge the presence or actions of other drivers .
Flashing can be a signal that the flashing driver is yielding the right of way , for example at an intersection controlled by stop signs .
Flashing can warn other drivers of road dangers , such as crashed cars or police speed traps .
Flashing can be used to give thanks .
For example , when one is warned of police activity , it is sometimes considered courteous to flash back .
Flashing can inform drivers of problems with their car , such as headlamps left off after dark , burned out or misaligned lights , or misuse of high beam rather than low beam in traffic ; or to berate a driver who poses a risk to traffic .
Headlight flashing coupled with blowing the car 's horn can help clear deer from a driver 's path .
Flashing can indicate the intention to overtake or pass another driver , or to signal a driver who has just overtaken that he or she can now return to the original lane .
Flashing can request or insist that a leading driver speed up or change lanes to get out of the way of a faster following driver .
Headlight flashing may constitute aggressive driving , and can be used in an attempt to intimidate others into speeding or otherwise driving unsafely .
Some drivers attempt to communicate " I will continue my current behavior ! "
when flashing their headlights .
For example , if such a driver flashes his or her headlights while slowing down , they intend to communicate to another driver who is waiting to merge in traffic :
" Go on , I will let you merge ! "
On the other hand , if such a driver keeps his or her current speed and flashes headlights , they intend to communicate " Stay back , I am not slowing down ! "
Headlight flashing may also indicate protest or celebration of an event or political position .
Motorcycle headlamp modulators automatically oscillate the intensity of the headlamp in an effort to make the motorcycle more conspicuous to other drivers .
EFFECTIVENESS AND AMBIGUITY Section::::Effectiveness and ambiguity .
Headlight flashing as an effective mode of driver communication has been questioned , and researchers have found the ability of drivers to communicate with one another is about the same as the communication abilities among insects .
However , when used as a means of increasing conspicuousness to other drivers , as in the case of motorcycle high / low beam modulators , it is highly effective .
Flashed headlamps can have ambiguous or contradictory meanings , with no way for the observing driver to tell for sure what the flashing driver is trying to say .
It may mean , for example , that the flashing driver intends to yield the right of way , or instead that he intends to take it .
Misinterpretation of the flashing driver 's intent can cause crashes .
LEGALITY AND MEANING AUSTRALIA Section::::Legality and meaning .
Section::::Australia .
Headlight flashing to warn drivers of traffic enforcement cameras is illegal in the state of Queensland , carrying a $ 30 fine and one demerit point , or a $ 1500 fine if the fine is unsuccessfully challenged in court .
Officers may either fine a driver for improper use of headlights , or may even arrest and prosecute for hindering police .
In the state of New South Wales , headlight flashing by regular drivers ( that is , not a police officer , etc . )
for any reason is illegal , except in emergency purposes and immediately before overtaking .
In Victoria , Traffic Superintendent Dean McWhirter has said he is happy for motorists to flash their lights to warn other motorists they were approaching a speed camera in 2013 .
BANGLADESH Section::::Bangladesh .
Headlight flashing is common in Bangladesh , where roads are sometimes narrow and lane discipline is lax .
It is done by large vehicles such as buses or trucks to alert smaller , more maneuverable vehicles to their presence and to encourage them to make way , for example by moving to the side of the road .
CANADA Section::::Canada .
In Ontario , the Highway Traffic Act does not prohibit " flashing head beams " .
Some have brought tickets to court , claiming the law only regulates the use of alternating lights in an attempt to impersonate emergency and law enforcement vehicles , and not a driver 's manually flashing his car 's headlamps to communicate with other drivers .
The section that deals with alternating headlights in Ontario is Section 169 of the Highway Traffic Act .
It is an offence to improperly use high - beams at night , which is dealt with by way of section 168 of the Highway Traffic Act .
INDIA Section::::India .
Headlight flashing in India is often used as a signal that the driver flashing you is offering to let you go first .
Such use is however strongly discouraged because it can lead to accidents where the driver flashing has not seen the approach of another road user .
It is also used to indicate to an oncoming vehicle to either stop or give way in narrow lanes .
JAMAICA Section::::Jamaica .
On some occasions , motorists who flashed their headlights to warn of police activity have unwittingly helped fugitives evade police .
In 2008 , one of Jamaica 's most wanted men went around police checkpoints which had been set up on his most likely routes after a driver had flashed his headlights to warn of police ahead .
Drivers were warned that flashing headlights may result in " unwittingly facilitating criminal activity " .
UNITED KINGDOM Section::::United Kingdom .
Though not all of its rules represent law , the Highway Code states " Only flash your headlights to let other road users know that you are there .

Drivers warning others about speed traps have been fined in the past for " misuse of headlights " .
Headlight flashing in the United Kingdom is often used as a signal that the driver flashing you is offering to let you go first .
Such use is however strongly discouraged because it can lead to accidents where the driver flashing has not seen the approach of another road user .
Using it to indicate that you are coming through and the other driver must wait , could lead to an accident .
Drivers should also be aware of the so - called " Flash - for - Cash " scam , in which criminals flash their lights to let other drivers out of a junction , then crash into them on purpose in order to make fraudulent insurance claims for damage and whiplash injury .
UNITED STATES Section::::United States .
In the United States , although the legality of headlight flashing varies from state to state , a federal court ruled that flashing headlights was a constitutionally protected form of speech , issuing an injunction prohibiting a police department from citing or prosecuting drivers who flash their lights to warn of radar and speed traps .
Some states consider that drivers have a First Amendment right to flash their headlights .
In other states , law enforcement officers give citations for headlight flashing under three types of laws :
( 1 ) laws prohibiting a person from obstructing a police investigation , ( 2 ) laws prohibiting a person from having flashing lights on their vehicle , and ( 3 ) laws prohibiting shining a vehicle 's high beams at oncoming traffic .
The specific language of each law varies by state along with courts ' holdings on whether their respective laws prohibit headlight flashing .
Additionally , although not legally binding , the state driver 's manual of some states suggests flashing high beams under specific scenarios ( e.g. if an oncoming vehicle is using its high beams , driver 's manuals suggest a motorist flash his or her high beams momentarily ) .

In Maryland , police officers sometimes ticket drivers for flashing car headlights under a law which prohibits driving in a vehicle with flashing lights and laws prohibiting " obstructing a police investigation " .
The American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland challenges the current interpretation of the law , contending the law refers to an adjective and not a verb ; that automatic flashing lights on non - emergency vehicles are illegal , but the act by a driver of manually flashing a vehicle 's headlamps is not .
Though ticketing was common in the 1990s , Maryland and Washington DC police say that flashing one 's headlights was not against the law in either place .
In Massachusetts , the practice of headlight flashing is technically not forbidden .

URBAN LEGEND Section::::Urban legend .
Beginning in the early 1980s , a widespread rumor regarding flashing headlights was spread mainly through fax , and later on the Internet .
The rumor stated that various gangs across the United States carry out an initiation wherein the initiate drives around at night with his headlights off .
Whichever driver flashes his headlamps in response to the unlit car becomes the target ; to complete the initiation , the prospective gang member must hunt down and shoot , kill , assault , or rape the target .
The story was widely spread by many government organizations , including the New Mexico State Police .
This rumor has been proven an urban legend .
The story originated in Montana in the early 1980s , where it was rumored that the Hells Angels bike gang was initiating recruits in this way .
By 1984 , the story had spread to Eugene , Oregon , where it had morphed into a story of Latino and black gangs targeting whites .
In August 1993 , the story once again appeared , this time spread through fax and email forwarding .
Warning of a " blood initiation weekend " on 25 and 26 September , the rumor this time led some police departments to issue warnings after having received the fake ones .
In February 1994 , a resident of Massillon , Ohio revived the rumor by issuing flyers which claimed that killings would take place at Westfield Belden Village .
After a night of sending faxes to local businesses , the person was arrested for inducing panic .
The rumor once again spread in October 1998 , when a new fax , this time claiming to originate with a Drug Abuse Resistance Education ( DARE ) officer in Texas .
The rumor spread further when officials in the San Diego government circulated the fax among city agencies ; this version of the fax , though quickly dismissed within city government when it was found that the Sheriff 's office had no real connection to it , now appeared to be a legitimate government - issued document .
Also in the fall of 1998 , the Sheriff 's office of Nassau County , Florida sent a warning about such gang initiation to the county fire department , who subsequently spread the fax to all county agencies .
Police dispatcher
Ann Johnson had thought the message urgent enough to send , but had not bothered to check its legitimacy .
The rumor provided inspiration for the 1998 film Urban Legend , and served as a plot device in Mark Billingham 's 2008 novel In The Dark .
An incident inspired by this legend is the catalyst for the 2007 film Death Sentence .
