AGONIST - ANTAGONIST
In pharmacology the term agonist - antagonist or mixed agonist / antagonist is used to refer to a drug which under some conditions behaves as an agonist ( a substance that fully activates the receptor that it binds to )
while under other conditions , behaves as an antagonist ( a substance that binds to a receptor but does not activate and can block the activity of other agonists ) .
Types of mixed agonist / antagonist include receptor ligands that act as agonist for some receptor types and antagonist for others or agonist in some tissues while antagonist in others ( also known as selective receptor modulators ) .
AGONIST - ANTAGONIST OPIOIDS Section::::Agonist - antagonist opioids .
The best known agonist - antagonists are opioids .
Examples of such opioids are : * pentazocine , agonist at the kappa ( κ ) and sigma ( σ ) and has a weak antagonist action at the mu opioid receptor ( μ ) .
* butorphanol , partial agonist at μ- and a pure agonist at κ - opioid receptor and antagonist activity at the delta opioid receptor ( δ )
* nalbuphine , κ - agonist / μ - antagonist analgesic Agonist – antagonist opioids usually have a ceiling effect – over particular dose they do n't increase their potency .
Hence agonist –
antagonist opioids have a lower addiction potential but also
lower analgesic efficacy and are more likely to produce psychotomimetic effects .
Agonist – antagonist opioids that block delta while activating mu opioid receptors produce analgesia without the development of tolerance .
