LEGISLATOR
A legislator ( or lawmaker ) is a person who writes and passes laws , especially someone who is a member of a legislature .
Legislators are usually politicians and are often elected by the people of the state .
Legislatures may be supra - national ( for example , the European Parliament ) , national ( for example , the United States Congress ) , regional ( for example , the National Assembly for Wales ) , or local ( for example , local authorities ) .
OVERVIEW
Section::::Overview .
The political theory of the separation of powers requires legislators to be different individuals from the members of the executive and the judiciary .
Certain political systems adhere to this principle , others do not .
In the United Kingdom , for example , the executive is formed almost exclusively from legislators ( members of Parliament )
although the judiciary is mostly independent ( until reforms in 2005 , the Lord Chancellor uniquely was a legislator , a member of the executive ( indeed , the Cabinet ) , and a judge , while until 2009 the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary were both judges and legislators as members of the House of Lords , though by convention they did not vote in the House until retirement ) .
In continental European jurisprudence and legal discussion , " the legislator " ( le l√©gislateur ) is the abstract entity that has produced the laws .
When there is room for interpretation , the intent of the legislator will be questioned , and the court is supposed to rule in the direction it judges to best fit the legislative intent , which can be difficult in the case of conflicting laws or constitutional provisions .
TERMINOLOGY Section::::Terminology .
The local term for a legislator is usually a derivation of the local term for the relevant legislature .
Typical examples include * Parliament : Member of Parliament * Assembly : Member of the Assembly
* Senate :
Senator * House of Representatives :
Representative * Congress : Member of Congress
The generic term " deputy " may also be used , deriving from the concept that the legislator is " deputising " for the electorate of his electoral district .
SUBSTITUTE LEGISLATOR Section::::Substitute legislator .
Some legislatures provide each legislator with an official " substitute legislator " who deputises for the legislator in the legislature if he or she is unavailable .
Venezuela , for example , provides for substitute legislators ( diputado suplente ) to be elected under Article 186 of its 1999 constitution .
Ecuador and Panama also have substitute legislators .
