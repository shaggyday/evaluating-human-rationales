TONGUE MAP
The tongue map or taste map is a common misconception that different sections of the tongue are exclusively responsible for different basic tastes .
It is illustrated with a schematic map of the tongue , with certain parts of the tongue labeled for each taste .
Although widely taught in schools , this was scientifically disproven by later research ; all taste sensations come from all regions of the tongue , although different parts are more sensitive to certain tastes .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The theory behind this map originated from a paper written by Harvard psychologist D.P Hanig , which was a translation of a German paper , Zur Psychophysik des Geschmackssinnes , which was written in 1901 .
The unclear representation of data in the former paper suggested that each part of the tongue tastes exactly one basic taste .
The paper showed minute differences in threshold detection levels across the tongue , but these differences were later taken out of context and the minute difference in threshold sensitivity was misconstrued in textbooks as a difference in sensation .
While some parts of the tongue may be able to detect a taste before the others do , all parts are equally capable of conveying the qualia of all tastes .
Threshold sensitivity may differ across the tongue , but intensity of sensation does not .
The same paper included a taste bud distribution diagram that showed a " taste belt " .
In 1974 , Virginia Collings investigated the topic again , and confirmed that all the tastes exist on all parts of the tongue .
TASTE BELT Section::::Taste belt .
The misinterpreted 2013 diagram in the article that sparked this myth shows human taste buds distributed in a " taste belt " along the inside of the tongue .
Prior to this , A. Hoffmann had concluded , in 1875 , that the dorsal center of the human tongue has practically no fungiform papillae and taste buds , and it was this finding that the diagram describes .
