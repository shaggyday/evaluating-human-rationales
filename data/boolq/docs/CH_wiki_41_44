BRIDGE OF THE AMERICAS
The Bridge of the Americas (; originally known as the Thatcher Ferry Bridge ) is a road bridge in Panama , which spans the Pacific entrance to the Panama Canal .
Designed by Sverdrup & Parcel , it was completed in 1962 at a cost of US$ 20 million , connecting the north and south American land masses .
Two other bridges cross the canal : the Atlantic Bridge at the Gatun locks ( expected 2018 ) and the Centennial Bridge .
DESCRIPTION Section::::Description .
The Bridge of the Americas crosses the Pacific approach to the Panama Canal at Balboa , near Panama City .
It was built between 1959 and 1962 by the United States at a cost of US$ 20 million .
From its completion in 1962 until the opening of the parallel Centennial Bridge in 2004 , the Bridge of the Americas was a key part of the Pan - American Highway .
The Bridge of the Americas greatly increases road traffic capacity across the Canal .
Two earlier bridges cross the Canal , but they use moveable designs and have limited traffic capacity .
These earlier spans include a small swinging road bridge , built into the lock structure at Gatún , and a swinging road / rail bridge constructed in 1942 at Miraflores .
The Centennial Bridge was constructed to eliminate the bottleneck of , and reduce traffic congestion on , the Bridge of the Americas .
The bridge is a cantilever design where the suspended span is a tied arch .
The bridge has a total length of 1,654 m ( 5,425 ft ) in 14 spans , abutment to abutment .
The main span measures and the tied arch ( the center part of the main span ) is .
The highest point of the bridge is above mean sea level ; the clearance under the main span is at high tide .
Ships must cross under this bridge when traversing the Panama Canal , and are subject to this height restriction .
The world 's largest cruise ships , , and the will fit within the canal 's widened locks , but they are too tall to pass under the Bridge of the Americas , even at low tide , unless the Bridge of the Americas is raised in the future .
( The Centennial Bridge is also a fixed obstacle , but its clearance is much higher : . )
The bridge has wide access ramps at each end , and pedestrian walkways on each side .
HISTORY
THE NEED FOR A BRIDGE Section::::History .
Section::::The need for a bridge .
From the beginning of the French project to construct a canal , it was recognised that the cities of Colón and Panamá would be split from the rest of the republic by the new canal .
This was an issue even during construction , when barges were used to ferry construction workers across the canal .
After the canal opened , the increasing number of cars , and the construction of a new road leading to Chiriquí , in the west of Panama , increased the need for some kind of crossing .
The Panama Canal Mechanical Division addressed this in August 1931 , with the commissioning of two new ferries , the Presidente Amador and President Washington .
This service was expanded in August 1940 , with additional barges mainly serving the military .
On June 3 , 1942 , a road / rail swing bridge was inaugurated at the Miraflores locks ; although only usable when no ships were passing , this provided some relief for traffic wishing to cross the canal .
Still , it was clear that a more substantial solution would be required .
To meet the growing needs of vehicle traffic , another ferry , the Presidente Porras , was added in November 1942 .
THE BRIDGE PROJECT Section::::The Bridge Project .
The idea of a permanent bridge over the canal had been proposed as a major priority as early as 1923 .
Subsequent administrations of Panama pressed this issue with the United States , which controlled the Canal Zone ; and in 1955 the Remón - Eisenhower treaty committed the United States to building a bridge .
A contract worth $ 20,000,000 was awarded to John F. Beasly & Company who built the bridge out of steel and reinforced concrete , and the project was initiated in a ceremony which took place on December 23 , 1958 , in the presence of United States Ambassador Julian Harrington , and Panamanian President Ernesto de la Guardia Navarro .
Construction began on October 12 , 1959 , and took nearly two and a half years to complete .
The inauguration of the bridge took place on October 12 , 1962 , with great ceremony .
The ribbon was cut by Maurice H. Thatcher , after which those present were allowed to walk across the bridge .
The ceremony was given full nationwide coverage on radio and television ; significant precautions were taken to manage the large crowds of people present .
These proved inadequate , however , and pro - Panamanian protesters disrupted the ceremony , even removing the memorial plaques on the bridge .
POST - CONSTRUCTION Section::::Post - construction .
When opened , the bridge was an important part of the Pan - American Highway , and carried around 9,500 vehicles per day ; however , this expanded over time , and by 2004 the bridge was carrying 35,000 vehicles per day .
The bridge therefore became a significant bottleneck on the highway , which led to the construction of the Centennial Bridge , which now carries the Pan - American Highway too .
On May 18 , 2010 , the bulk cargo ship Atlantic Hero struck one of the protective bases of the bridge after losing engine power , partially blocking that section of the canal to shipping traffic .
The bridge did not receive damage and there were no fatalities .
In December 2010 , the Centennial Bridge access road collapsed in a mudslide , and commercial traffic was diverted to the Bridge of The Americas .
THE " THATCHER FERRY BRIDGE " Section::::The " Thatcher Ferry Bridge " .
The bridge was originally named " Thatcher Ferry Bridge " , after the original ferry which crossed the canal at about the same point .
The ferry was , in turn , named after Maurice H. Thatcher , a former member of the Canal Commission , who introduced the legislation which created the ferry .
Thatcher cut the tape at the inauguration of the bridge .
The name was unpopular with the government of Panama , however , which preferred the name " Bridge of the Americas " .
The Panamanian view was made official by a resolution of the National Assembly on October 2 , 1962 , ten days before the inauguration .
The resolution read as follows :
The bridge over the Panama Canal shall bear the name Bridge of the Americas .
Said name will be used exclusively to identify said bridge .
Panamanian government officials shall reject any document in which reference is made to the bridge by any name other than " Bridge of the Americas " .
A copy of this resolution , with the appropriate note on style , shall be forwarded to all legislative bodies of the world , so that all may give the bridge the name chosen by this honorable assembly , complying with the express will of the Panamanian people .
Given in the city of Panama on the second day of the month of October of nineteen hundred and sixty - two .
During the inauguration ceremony ( which was concluded with the playing of the " Thatcher Ferry Bridge March " ) , U.S. Under Secretary of State George Wildman Ball said in his speech : " we can look today to this bridge as a new and bright step toward the realization of that dream of a Pan - American Highway , which is now almost a reality .
The grand bridge we inaugurate today — truly a bridge of the Americas — completes the last stage of the highway from the United States to Panama " .
Nonetheless , the official name of the bridge became the " Thatcher Ferry Bridge " and remained so until Panamanian control in 1979 .
Postage stamps were issued with the name " Thatcher Ferry Bridge " .
In the postage stamps and postal history of the Canal Zone they are well known for an error on one sheet where the bridge is missing .
