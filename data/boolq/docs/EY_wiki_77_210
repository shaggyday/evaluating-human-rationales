ABOVE - THE - LINE
DEDUCTION
Above the line deductions are also known as " adjustments to income " and are shown on lines 23 - 36 of Form 1040 .
In the United States tax law , an above - the - line deduction is a deduction that the Internal Revenue Service allows a taxpayer to subtract from his or her gross income in arriving at " adjusted gross income " for the taxable year .
These deductions are set forth in Internal Revenue Code Section 62 .
A taxpayer 's gross income minus his or her above - the - line deductions is equal to the adjusted gross income .
Because these deductions are taken before adjusted gross income is calculated , they are designated " above - the - line . "
Thus , those deductions allowed in computing " taxable income " under section 63 of the IRC are " below the line deductions " ( thus , adjusted gross income represents " the line " ) .
Above - the - line deductions may be more valuable to high income taxpayers than below - the - line deductions .
IMPACT
Section::::Impact .
Above - the - line deductions are generally more advantageous for a high income taxpayer than so - called below - the - line deductions .
Below the line deductions are subtracted from a taxpayer 's adjusted gross income .
Above - the - line deductions may also be subject to income - sensitive phaseouts or limitations , e.g. , MAGI limits on Tuition and Fees deduction on line 34 .
Certain below the line deductions are also phased out for high income taxpayers pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 68 .
Medical and dental expenses are below the line deductions pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 67 .
These expenses may only be deducted , however , to the extent they exceed 10 % ( 7.5 % for 65 and over ) of a taxpayer 's AGI .
( Accordingly , if a taxpayer had an adjusted gross income of $ 100,000 and medical expenses of $ 11,000 , he or she would only be entitled to deduct the amount by which these expenses exceed 10 % of $ 100,000 , or $ 10,000 .
Because these expenses exceed $ 10,000 by $ 1,000 , the taxpayer is only entitled to a $ 1,000 deduction .
Above - the - line deductions are also preferred because they can be taken by ALL taxpayers regardless of whether they take standard or itemized deductions ( see attached tax ladder ) .
Moreover , they are desirable because they reduce adjusted gross income ( AGI ) .
Generally , the smaller the AGI , the greater the percentage of deductibility of itemized deductions .
LIST OF THE ABOVE - THE - LINE DEDUCTIONS Section::::List of the above - the - line deductions .
