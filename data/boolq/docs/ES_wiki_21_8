CRITICAL AND PUBLIC RESPONSE Section::::Critical and
public response . !

Rotten Tomatoes !
Metacritic !
CinemaScore Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe praised the first three X - Men films as " more than a cash - guzzling wham - bang Hollywood franchise ...
these three movies sport philosophy , ideas , a telethon - load of causes , and a highly elastic us - versus - them allegory .
"
Morris praised X - Men :
The Last Stand for " put[ting ] the heroes of a mighty summer blockbuster in a rare mortal position .
Realism at this time of year ?
How unorthodox ! "
Roger Ebert gave the films mostly positive reviews , but criticized them for the amount of mutants , stating " their powers are so various and ill - matched that it 's hard to keep them all on the same canvas . "
The first two films were highly praised due to their cerebral tone .
However , when director Bryan Singer left the series , many criticized his successor , Brett Ratner .
Colin Colvert of the Star Tribune felt " Singer 's sensitivity to [ the discrimination themes ] made
the first two X - Men films surprisingly resonant and soulful for comic - based summer extravaganzas ...
Singer is adept at juggling large casts of three - dimensional characters , Ratner makes shallow , unimaginative bang - ups . "
James Berardinelli felt , "
X - Men : The Last Stand is n't as taut or satisfying as X - Men 2 , but it 's better constructed and better paced than the original X - Men .
The differences in quality between the three are minor , however ; despite the change in directors , there seems to be a single vision . "
David Denby of The New Yorker praised " the liquid beauty and the poetic fantasy of Singer 's work " , but called Ratner 's film " a crude synthesizer of comedy and action tropes . "
Singer 's third film in the series ,
X - Men : Days of Future Past was also well received .
Alonso Duralde of The Wrap felt that " Singer keeps things moving along briskly enough that you can just go along with the ride of Superhero Stuff without getting bogged down " .
Spider - Man director Sam Raimi said he was a fan of the series , particularly Singer 's films .
Film historian Kim Newman also tonally compared Batman Begins to Singer 's films .
Logan received a nomination from Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay .
There was criticism of the large cast , and the limited screentime for all of them .
Richard George of IGN reacted well to the depictions of Wolverine , Professor X , Magneto , Jean Grey , Storm , William Stryker , Mystique , Beast and Nightcrawler ; however , George thought many of the younger X - Men characters , such as Rogue , Iceman , Pyro , Angel and Kitty Pryde were " adjectiveless teenager[s ] " , and was disappointed by Cyclops ' characterization .
He observed the filmmakers were " big fans of silent henchmen " , due to the small roles of the various villainous mutants ; such as Lady Deathstrike and Psylocke .
While Jesse Schedeen of IGN , stated that the continuity of the films does n't make sense with dead characters returning with zero or little explanation , different versions of the same character appearing across multiple films and plot points that are conveniently ignored in later films .
He also criticized 20th Century Fox for not mapping out the series from the beginning .
LEGACY Section::::Legacy .
Richard George of IGN stated that the success of the first X - Men film paved the way for comic - book film adaptations such as the Spider - Man series , Fantastic Four ( 2005 ) , V for Vendetta and Singer 's Superman Returns .
Chris Hewitt of Empire magazine called the first X - Men film as the " catalyst " for films based on Marvel Comics characters , stating " Singer 's 2000 film is the catalyst for everything that 's come since , good and bad .
Without it , there 's no Marvel Studios .
" Comic - book writer Mark Millar said that Singer 's X - Men " revolutionized " superhero films .
Rebecca Rubin of Variety magazine stated that the X - Men franchise has proven there 's an audience for a hardline superhero film .
While Jeff Bock of Exhibitor Relations said that with films like the Deadpool films and Logan , that studios can do more with an R - rated film , and give the audience something new .
