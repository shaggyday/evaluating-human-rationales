SYNOPSIS SETTING
Section::::Synopsis . Section::::Setting .
Over 100 years before the beginning of the story on an alternate world , giant humanoid creatures called suddenly appeared and nearly wiped out humanity , devouring them without remorse or reason and only targeting them ; they completely ignore other wildlife .
What remains of humanity now resides within three enormous curtain walls : the outermost is ; the middle wall is and the innermost is .
Inside these walls , humanity has lived in uneasy peace for one hundred years , many people growing up without ever having seen a Titan .
This all changes when one day , a giant -tall Colossus Titan mysteriously appears after a strike of lightning and breaches the outer wall ( which is 50 meters tall ) of the Shiganshina district , a town at Wall Maria , allowing the smaller Titans to invade the district .
An Armored Titan smashes clean through the gate in Wall Maria , forcing humankind to abandon the land between Wall Maria and Wall Rose , evacuating the remaining population into the inner districts .
The sudden influx of population causes turmoil and famine .
The Titans are giant humanoid figures ranging between tall and are usually masculine in body structure but lack reproductive organs .
Although they do not appear to need food , they instinctively attack and eat humans on sight ; it is mentioned that they derive their energy from sunlight .
Furthermore , the Titans also do not have a proper digestive tract ; once they have eaten their fill of human prey , Titans will vomit large , slimy balls , derisively referred to as " hairballs " , as shown in the episode where the squad retakes Trost .
Finally , their skin is tough and difficult to penetrate , and they regenerate quickly from injuries , except for a weak spot at the nape of their neck .
Combating the Titans is the military , which is divided into three branches .
Foremost in the story is the , which goes out into Titan territory to try to reclaim the land .
The Survey Corps is heavily derided in society because of its apparently senseless high casualty rate and little sense of progress .
The second and largest branch is the , which guards the walls and the civilian populace .
The third branch is the , which guards the royal family and lives relatively relaxed lives in the innermost wall , although this eventually results in fraud , corruption , and political subterfuge .
The soldiers use a grappling , tethering system called that allows them to jump onto ( and swing from ) walls , trees , or nearby buildings to attack Titans with dual swords , and use gas canisters which to propel themselves .
However , despite it being the soldiers ' primary line of both offense and defense against the Titans , it is useless in open and flat terrain like fields .
It is later revealed that the Titans were created when Ymir Fritz found the " source of all organic life " and became the Founding Titan which gave her the ability to create and control the Titans .
When Ymir Fritz died as a side effect of having the Titan ability for 13 years , her power was divided among nine who pass their abilities to another upon death to other Subjects of Ymir , also known the Eldian people .
These Titans consist of the Founding Titan , the Attack Titan , the Colossal Titan , the Armored Titan , the Female Titan , the Beast Titan , the Jaw Titan , the Cart Titan , and the War Hammer Titan .
The Founding Titan remained with the Fritz family as Eldia 's 145th King Karl Fritz arranged for his country 's fall by the country of Marley and took a handful of his people to the island of Paradis where he used the countless Colossus Titans to make the walls and erased the memories of the Eldians he brought with him so that they did not know anything about the outside world , his descendants continuing his work while the Eldians in Marley suffer as second - class citizen with some being exiled to Paradis as the Titans that terrorize the island 's residents .
PLOT Section::::Plot .
Eren Yeager lives with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and best friend Armin Arlert in the town of Shiganshina adjacent to Wall Maria , outermost of three circular walls protecting humanity from man - eating Titans said to have killed all other humans one hundred years prior .
When Shiganshina and Wall Maria are breached by the Colossal and Armored Titans , invading Titans force humanity to retreat behind Wall Rose .
After a titan devours his mother and his father disappears , a vengeful Eren enlists in the military along with Mikasa and Armin .
Five years later , the three cadet graduates are positioned in Trost district adjacent to Wall Rose when the Colossal Titan breaches the city gate .
During the subsequent Titan invasion , Eren is eaten but survives after creating and controlling a Titan 's body .
Previously unaware of his abilities , Eren suspects his father 's basement holds answers .
Although Eren seals Trost 's breach using his Titan power , many consider him a potential threat and a military tribunal assigns him to the Survey Corps under Captain Levi 's watch , with many of Eren 's friends following suit .
During an expedition to Shiganshina , a Female Titan unsuccessfully attempts to capture Eren .
Despite the expedition 's failure , Armin deduces the Female Titan 's identity as a fellow cadet from their class named Annie Leonheart with abilities akin to Eren 's .
Annie encases herself in crystal following her capture in Stohess , collateral damage revealing the walls are formed from massive Titans within them .
Following the mysterious appearance of the Beast Titan behind Wall Rose , Eren is kidnapped by his fellow cadets Reiner Braun and Bertolt Hoover , exposed as the Titans who compromised Wall Maria .
They and Annie were dispatched by an unknown party to capture the " Coordinate " , an ability to control titans which they suspect Eren possesses .
Eren manifests this power during an encounter with the titan who killed his mother , allowing him and the pursuing Survey Corps to escape .
The Corps theorize that Titans were originally humans , and may regain their human form by consuming an individual with Titan power , acquiring those abilities for themselves .
Persecuted by the military police , the Survey Corps discover the royal government seats a figurehead king and suppresses technological advancement .
Eren 's comrade Historia Reiss learns she is the illegitimate child of the walls ' true ruler Rod Reiss , who has her and Eren kidnapped .
Rod reveals his ancestor created the walls using the power of the Founding Titan , intending to confine humanity and erasing their memories .
The Reiss family passed down the King 's power and will until Eren 's father Grisha stole the power of the Founding Titan during Wall Maria 's fall , and passed its power to Eren by turning him into a Titan via an injection and allowing himself to be devoured .
Rod intends for Historia to become a Titan and eat Eren to reclaim the Reiss family 's power , but Historia refuses and aids the Survey Corps ' rescue of Eren and rebellion against the monarchy .
Following Rod 's defeat , the military assumes power and crowns Historia queen .
Although Eren 's lack of royal ancestry inhibits the Founding Titan 's power , he obtains an ability to create permanent structures , which the Survey Corps use in their next expedition to seal the breach in Wall Maria .
However , the group are ambushed by Reiner , Bertolt and their superior Zeke , the Beast Titan .
The Survey Corps subdue Bertolt and drive off the other enemy Titans , but most of the expedition members are killed during the battle with Armin and Commander Erwin Smith left mortally wounded .
Levi , armed with a single injection taken from Rod , decides to save Armin over Erwin .
Armin devours Bertolt and acquires the Colossal Titan 's powers .
Before returning home , the survivors recover Grisha 's memoirs from the Yeagers ' basement .
His writings state that human civilization is actually thriving and the people of the walls are members of the Eldian race , whose common ancestor Ymir Fritz acquired the Power of the Titans , granting her progeny the unique potential to become Titans and inherit nine Titan powers .
Ymir 's descendants dominated world history for centuries until 100 years prior to the series ' beginning , when the 145th Eldian King retreated to Paradis Island and established the three walls with the Founding Titan , threatening to retaliate with the titans comprising the walls should his peace be disturbed .
The nation of Marley conquered the remaining Eldians , quarantining them in ghettos and passing the seven captured Titan Powers to indoctrinated Eldian " Warriors " for furthering Marley 's national interests .
Grisha conspired with other Eldian dissidents to acquire the Founding Titan before Marley and free their people but was outed by his son Zeke Yeager , Eren 's half - brother and the future Beast Titan , and sentenced to life as a mindless Titan wandering Paradis .
However , Grisha was saved by his movement 's informant , who entrusted his Titan power and mission to Grisha and sent him to infiltrate the walls and recover the Founding Titan .
Eren learns that despite his lack of royal ancestry , he may be able to use the Founding Titan 's full " Coordinate " power through physical contact with a titan of royal blood .
Four years after the Battle of Shiganshina , a conflict between Marley and a combined offensive sees the emergence of conventional weapons capable of defeating Titans .
Fearing the military obsolescence of Eldians will lead to their genocide , the Warriors work with the influential Tybur family , retainers of the War Hammer Titan , to recruit global support for a resumed offensive on Paradis .
The family 's patriarch , Willy Tybur , holds a rally in the Eldian ghetto of Liberio with foreign dignitaries in attendance and reveals that the 145th King lamented the Eldians ' history , arranged the fall of the Eldian Empire and would have allowed for his people 's genocide had his will and power not been stolen .
Eren , having infiltrated Marley on his own , confronts Reiner before assassinating Willy Tybur as he labels Eren a threat to world peace and declares war on Paradis .
With the aid of the Survey Corps in the ensuing battle , Eren steals the War Hammer Titan 's power and Zeke defects to Paradis .
Eren and the Survey Corps return to Paradis with Zeke via airship , but Eren 's friend Sasha is killed by Gabi Braun , Warrior candidate and Reiner 's cousin who stowed away along with her friend Falco Grice .
Flashbacks depict the preceding four years on Paradis , during which Zeke 's followers arrived and introduced Paradis to modern technology and the friendly nation of Hizuru .
Through his emissary Yelena , Zeke proposed passing his Titan power to Historia , which would enable Eren to use the Founding Titan 's full power to deter foreign invasion until Hizuru modernizes Paradis .
Because users of Titan power die thirteen years after their acquisition , the proposition demanded that Historia produce heirs to ensure the availability of the Founding Titan 's power .
Eren disapproved of this arrangement and instead infiltrated Marley alone and without authorization , coercing the Survey Corps 's assistance .
In the present , Eren is detained for insubordination and his friends express doubt in his loyalties to them and Paradis over Zeke .
It is revealed that Historia is pregnant , preventing the Corps from immediately passing the Beast Titan to her and forcing them to place Zeke under Levi 's watch .
Suspected of arranging Historia 's pregnancy to prolong Zeke 's life , Yelena and her followers are arrested .
The military 's leaders distrust Eren and plan to relinquish his power following the discovery of his secret correspondence with Zeke and Yelena , prompting nationalist rebels loyal to Eren to assassinate the commander - in - chief .
Eren escapes his cell and seeks out Zeke alongside his supporters , now called the Yeagerists .
Meanwhile , the Warriors infiltrate Paradis in advance of an international counterattack against the island .
The Survey Corps discover wine tainted with Zeke 's spinal fluid has been served throughout the military , enabling Zeke to turn the victims into titans with his shout .
Falco , who had escaped custody alongside Gabi , is inadvertently poisoned by the wine .
Eren and the Yeagerists capture the Corps along with Gabi and depart for Shiganshina , while Zeke turns his guards into Titans and escapes confinement .
PRODUCTION Section::::Production .
Hajime Isayama created a 65-page one - shot version of Attack on Titan in 2006 .
In a 2018 interview with NHK , Isayama revealed that his inspiration for the series came from his hometown of Hita , ≈åita , while wondering if there were monsters beyond the walls bordering the town .
Originally , he also offered his work to the Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump department at Shueisha , where he was advised to modify his style and story to be more suitable for Jump .
He declined and instead decided to take it to the Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine department at Kodansha .
Before serialization began in 2009 , he had already thought of ideas for twists , although they are fleshed out as the series progresses .
The author initially based the scenery in the manga on that of his hometown , which is surrounded by mountains .
While working at an internet cafe , Isayama encountered a customer who grabbed him by the collar .
It was this incident that showed him " the fear of meeting a person I ca n't communicate with , " which is the feeling that he conveys through the Titans .
When designing the appearances of the Titans , he uses several models such as martial artist Yushin Okami for Eren Yeager 's Titan form as well as Brock Lesnar for the Armored Titan .
George Wada , the anime 's producer , stated that the " Wall of Fear " was influenced by the isolated and enclosed nature of Japanese culture .
He also said that the inner feelings of every individual is one of the series ' main influences .
Isayama later would confirm that Attack on Titan was inspired in part by Muv - Luv Alternative , the second visual novel in the Muv - Luv visual novel series .
Isayama estimated his basic monthly timeline as one week to storyboard and three weeks to actually draw the chapter .
The story is planned out in advance , even marking down in which collected volumes a specific " truth " will be revealed .
In September 2013 , he stated that he was aiming to end the series in 20 collected volumes .
Originally , Isayama planned to give the series a tragic conclusion similar to that of the film adaptation of Stephen King 's The Mist , where every character dies .
However , positive response to the manga and anime has caused the author to contemplate changing the ending due to the impact it could have on fans .
On November 16th , Isayama reported saying that the final chapter is now in development and did a documentary about it .

The artwork of the manga has been criticized as crude by some reviewers , with Isayama himself admitting his drawings are " amateurish . "
However , those same critics stated that after years of serialization , the art has been improving , and Kure believes that had the illustrations been " refined " , it would not have conveyed the " eeriness " that is a key characteristic of the work .
In a short review , Jason Thompson noted how the characters conveniently receive " power - ups " to create plot twists , but concluded that these said plot twists and the manga 's post - apocalyptic world are " too good to miss . "

Kimlinger criticized Araki 's direction , saying he " clearly intends it to be powerful and unsettling , but it 's just crude and unpleasant . "
On the other hand , other critics from Anime News Network praised much of the series .
Rebecca Silverman said it " is both gorgeous and appalling in its visuals " , and " an excellent mix of what 18th century Gothic novelist Ann Radcliffe defined as horror versus terror : the one is physical , making you want to look away , and the other is intellectual , making you want to know what 's going to happen next . "

John Sinnott of DVD Talk called the series one of the best ones he has ever watched and one " that anime fans should not miss . " POLITICAL INTERPRETATIONS Section::::Political interpretations .
The series has gained a strong popularity in not only Japan but also throughout the world .
For instance , coverage of the anime appeared on the front page of the Hong Kong free newspaper am730 on May 27 , 2013 , concerning its popularity within Hong Kong as well as in Mainland China and Taiwan .
The series also attracted criticism : the South Korean Electronic Times magazine accused Attack on Titan of having a militaristic message that serves Japanese Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe 's political leanings ; while the series also resonated with Hong Kong youths who saw the invading Titans as a metaphor for mainland China .
Hong Kong media commentator Wong Yeung - tat praised Isayama 's style and the versatility of Attack on Titans setting , which opens itself to readers ' various interpretations .
In 2013 , after media linked to a 2010 blog post by Isayama indicating that the design of the character Dot Pixis was based on the Imperial Japanese General Akiyama Yoshifuru , an Internet flame war about the general 's war record ( e.g. allowing the Port Arthur massacre to occur ) ensued on his blog and included death threats to the author .
Because many of the threats written in Japanese had grammatical errors , it is believed that they were written by people outside of Japan .
The central political message of breaking free from the prison of collective historical guilt imposed by a decadent ruling class echoes the nationalist political wave sweeping the globe in the late 2010s , as well as drawing criticism from its opponents .
CHINA BAN Section::::China ban .
On June 12 , 2015 , the Chinese Ministry of Culture listed Attack on Titan among 38 anime and manga titles banned in China .
