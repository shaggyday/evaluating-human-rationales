PEROXIDE
Peroxides are a group of compounds with the structure
R−O−O−R.
The O−O group in a peroxide is called the peroxide group or peroxo group .
In contrast to oxide ions , the oxygen atoms in the peroxide ion have an oxidation state of −1 .
The most common peroxide is hydrogen peroxide ( HO ) , colloquially known simply as " peroxide " .
It is marketed as a solution in water at various concentrations .
Since hydrogen peroxide is colorless , so are these solutions .
It is mainly used as an oxidant and bleaching agent .
However , hydrogen peroxide is also biochemically produced in the human body , largely as a result of a range of oxidase enzymes .
Concentrated solutions are potentially dangerous when in contact with organic compounds .
Aside from hydrogen peroxide , some other major classes of peroxides are these : * Peroxy acids , the peroxy derivatives of many familiar acids , examples being peroxymonosulfuric acid and peracetic acid .
* Metal peroxides , examples being barium peroxide ( BaO ) and sodium peroxide ( NaO ) .
* Organic peroxides , compounds with the linkage C−O−O−C or
C−O−O−H. One example is tert - butylhydroperoxide * Main group peroxides , compounds with the linkage E−O−O−E ( E = main group element ) , one example is potassium peroxydisulfate .
