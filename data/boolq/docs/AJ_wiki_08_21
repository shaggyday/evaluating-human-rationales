EDINBURGH CASTLE Edinburgh Castle ( ) is a historic fortress which dominates the skyline of the city of Edinburgh , Scotland , from its position on the Castle Rock .
Archaeologists have established human occupation of the rock since at least the Iron Age ( 2nd century AD ) , although the nature of the early settlement is unclear .
There has been a royal castle on the rock since at least the reign of David I in the 12th century , and the site continued to be a royal residence until 1633 .
From the 15th century the castle 's residential role declined , and by the 17th century it was principally used as military barracks with a large garrison .
Its importance as a part of Scotland 's national heritage was recognised increasingly from the early 19th century onwards , and various restoration programmes have been carried out over the past century and a half .
As one of the most important strongholds in the Kingdom of Scotland , Edinburgh Castle was involved in many historical conflicts from the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 14th century to the Jacobite rising of 1745 .
Research undertaken in 2014 identified 26 sieges in its 1100-year - old history , giving it a claim to having been " the most besieged place in Great Britain and one of the most attacked in the world " .
Few of the present buildings pre - date the Lang Siege of the 16th century , when the medieval defences were largely destroyed by artillery bombardment .
The most notable exceptions are St Margaret 's Chapel from the early 12th century , which is regarded as the oldest building in Edinburgh , the Royal Palace and the early-16th - century Great Hall , although the interiors have been much altered from the mid - Victorian period onwards .
The castle also houses the Scottish regalia , known as the Honours of Scotland and is the site of the Scottish National War Memorial and the National War Museum of Scotland .
The British Army is still responsible for some parts of the castle , although its presence is now largely ceremonial and administrative .
Some of the castle buildings house regimental museums which contribute to its presentation as a tourist attraction .
The castle , in the care of Historic Scotland , is Scotland 's most - visited paid tourist attraction , with over 2 million visitors in 2017 and over 70 percent of leisure visitors to Edinburgh visiting the castle .
As the backdrop to the Edinburgh Military Tattoo during the annual Edinburgh Festival the castle has become a recognisable symbol of Edinburgh and of Scotland .

Section::::Pre - history of the Castle Rock .
Section::::Geology .
The castle stands upon the plug of an extinct volcano , which is estimated to have risen about 350 million years ago during the lower Carboniferous period .
The Castle Rock is the remains of a volcanic pipe , which cut through the surrounding sedimentary rock before cooling to form very hard dolerite , a type of basalt .
Subsequent glacial erosion was resisted by the dolerite , which protected the softer rock to the east , leaving a crag and tail formation .
The summit of the Castle Rock is above sea level , with rocky cliffs to the south , west and north , rising to a height of above the surrounding landscape .
This means that the only readily accessible route to the castle lies to the east , where the ridge slopes more gently .
The defensive advantage of such a site is self - evident , but the geology of the rock also presents difficulties , since basalt is extremely impermeable .
Providing water to the Upper Ward of the castle was problematic , and despite the sinking of a deep well , the water supply often ran out during drought or siege , for example during the Lang Siege in 1573 .
EARLIEST HABITATION
Section::::Earliest habitation .
Archaeological investigation has yet to establish when the Castle Rock was first used as a place of human habitation .
There is no record of any Roman interest in the location during General Agricola 's invasion of northern Britain near the end of the 1st century AD .
Ptolemy 's map of the 2nd century AD shows a settlement in the territory of the Votadini named " Alauna " , meaning " rock place " , making this possibly the earliest known name for the Castle Rock .
This could , however , refer to another of the tribe 's hill forts in the area .
The Orygynale Cronykil of Andrew of Wyntoun ( c. 1350 – c. 1423 ) , an early source for Scottish history , names " Ebrawce " ( Ebraucus ) , a legendary King of the Britons , as having " byggyd [ built ] Edynburgh " .
According to the earlier chronicler , Geoffrey of Monmouth ( c. 1100 – c. 1155 ) , Ebraucus had fifty children by his twenty wives , and was the founder of " Kaerebrauc " ( York ) , " Alclud " ( Dumbarton ) and the " Maidens ' Castle " .
The 16th - century English writer John Stow ( c. 1525 – 1605 ) , credited Ebraucus with building " the Castell of Maidens called Edenbrough " in 989 BC .
The name " Maidens ' Castle " ( or ) occurs frequently up until the 16th century .
It appears in charters of David I ( r. 1124–1153 ) and his successors , although the reason for it is not known .
William Camden 's survey of Britain , Britannia ( 1607 ) , records that " the Britans called [ it ]
Castle Myned Agned [ winged rock ] , the Scots , the Maidens Castle and the Virgins Castle , of certaine young maidens of the Picts roiall bloud who were kept there in old time " .
According to the 17th - century antiquarian Father Richard Hay , the " maidens " were a group of nuns , who were ejected from the castle and replaced by canons , considered " fitter to live among soldiers " .
However , this story was considered " apocryphal " by the 19th - century antiquarian Daniel Wilson and has been ignored by historians since .
The name may have been derived from a " Cult of the Nine Maidens " type of legend .
Arthurian legends suggest that the site once held a shrine to Morgain la Fee , one of nine sisters .
Later , St Monenna , said to be one of nine companions , reputedly invested a church at Edinburgh , as well as at Dumbarton and other places .
Similar names are shared by many other Iron Age hillforts and may have simply described a castle that had never been taken by force or derived from an earlier Brittonic name like mag dun .
An archaeological excavation in the early 1990s
uncovered evidence of the site having been settled during the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age , potentially making the Castle Rock the longest continually occupied site in Scotland .
However , the extent of the finds was not particularly significant and was insufficient to draw any certain conclusions about the precise nature or scale of this earliest known phase of occupation .
The archaeological evidence is more reliable in respect of the Iron Age .
Traditionally , it had been supposed that the tribes of central Scotland had made little or no use of the Castle Rock .
Excavations at nearby Dunsapie Hill , Duddingston , Inveresk and Traprain Law had revealed relatively large settlements and it was supposed that these sites had been chosen in preference to the Castle Rock .
However , the excavation in the 1990s pointed to the probable existence of an enclosed hill fort on the rock , although only the fringes of the site were excavated .
House fragments revealed were similar to Iron Age dwellings previously found in Northumbria .
The 1990s dig revealed clear signs of habitation from the 1st and 2nd centuries AD , consistent with Ptolemy 's reference to " Alauna " .
Signs of occupation included some Roman material , including pottery , bronzes and brooches , implying a possible trading relationship between the Votadini and the Romans beginning with Agricola 's northern campaign in AD 82 , and continuing through to the establishment of the Antonine Wall around AD 140 .
The nature of the settlement in this period is inconclusive , but Driscoll and Yeoman suggest it may have been a broch , similar to the one at Edin 's Hall near Duns in the Scottish Borders .
EARLY MIDDLE AGES
Section::::Early Middle Ages .
The castle does not re - appear in contemporary historical records from the time of Ptolemy until around AD 600 .
Then , in the epic Welsh poem Y Gododdin there is a reference to Din Eidyn , " the stronghold of Eidyn " .
This has been generally assumed to refer to the Castle Rock .
The poem tells of the Gododdin King Mynyddog Mwynfawr , and his band of warriors , who , after a year of feasting in their fortress , set out to do battle with the Angles at " Catreath " ( possibly Catterick ) in Yorkshire .
Despite performing glorious deeds of valour and bravery , the poem relates that the Gododdin were massacred .
The Irish annals record that in 638 , after the events related in Y Gododdin , " Etin " was besieged by the Angles under Oswald of Northumbria , and the Gododdin were defeated .
The territory around Edinburgh then became part of the Kingdom of Northumbria , which was itself absorbed by England in the 10th century .
Lothian became part of Scotland , during the reign of Indulf ( r.954–962 ) .
The archaeological evidence for the period in question is based entirely on the analysis of middens ( domestic refuse heaps ) , with no evidence of structures .
Few conclusions can therefore be derived about the status of the settlement during this period , although the midden deposits show no clear break since Roman times .
HIGH MIDDLE AGES Section::::High
Middle Ages .
The first documentary reference to a castle at Edinburgh is John of Fordun 's account of the death of King Malcolm III .
Fordun describes his widow , the future Saint Margaret , as residing at the " Castle of Maidens " when she is brought news of his death in November 1093 .
Fordun 's account goes on to relate how Margaret died of grief within days , and how Malcolm 's brother Donald Bane laid siege to the castle .
However , Fordun 's chronicle was not written until the later 14th century , and the near - contemporary account of the life of St Margaret by Bishop Turgot makes no mention of a castle .
During the reigns of Malcolm III and his sons , Edinburgh Castle became one of the most significant royal centres in Scotland .
Malcolm 's son King Edgar died here in 1107 .
Malcolm 's youngest son , King David
I ( r.1124–1153 ) , developed Edinburgh as a seat of royal power principally through his administrative reforms ( termed by some modern scholars the Davidian Revolution ) .
Between 1139 and 1150 , David held an assembly of nobles and churchmen , a precursor to the parliament of Scotland , at the castle .
Any buildings or defences would probably have been of timber , although two stone buildings are documented as having existed in the 12th century .
Of these , St. Margaret 's Chapel remains at the summit of the rock .
The second was a church , dedicated to St. Mary , which stood on the site of the Scottish National War Memorial .
Given that the southern part of the Upper Ward ( where Crown Square is now sited ) was not suited to being built upon until the construction of the vaults in the 15th century , it seems probable that any earlier buildings would have been located towards the northern part of the rock ; that is around the area where St. Margaret 's Chapel stands .
This has led to a suggestion that the chapel is the last remnant of a square , stone keep , which would have formed the bulk of the 12th - century fortification .
The structure may have been similar to the keep of Carlisle Castle , which David I began after 1135 .
David 's successor King Malcolm IV ( r.1153–1165 ) reportedly stayed at Edinburgh more than at any other location .
But in 1174 , King William " the Lion " ( r.1165–1214 ) was captured by the English at the Battle of Alnwick .
He was forced to sign the Treaty of Falaise to secure his release , in return for surrendering Edinburgh Castle , along with the castles of Berwick , Roxburgh and Stirling , to the English King , Henry II .
The castle was occupied by the English for twelve years , until 1186 , when it was returned to William as the dowry of his English bride , Ermengarde de Beaumont , who had been chosen for him by King Henry .
By the end of the 12th century , Edinburgh Castle was established as the main repository of Scotland 's official state papers .
WARS OF SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE Section::::Wars of Scottish Independence .
A century later , in 1286 , on the death of King Alexander III , the throne of Scotland became vacant .
Edward I of England was appointed to adjudicate the competing claims for the Scottish crown , but used the opportunity to attempt to establish himself as the feudal overlord of Scotland .
During the negotiations , Edward stayed briefly at Edinburgh Castle and may have received homage there from the Scottish nobles .
In March 1296 , Edward I launched an invasion of Scotland , unleashing the First War of Scottish Independence .
Edinburgh Castle soon came under English control , surrendering after a three days long bombardment .
Following the siege , Edward had many of the Scottish legal records and royal treasures moved from the castle to England .
A large garrison numbering 325 men was installed in 1300 .
Edward also brought to Scotland his master builders of the Welsh castles , including Thomas de Houghton and Master Walter of Hereford , both of whom travelled from Wales to Edinburgh .
After the death of Edward I in 1307 , however , England 's control over Scotland weakened .
On 14 March 1314 , a surprise night attack by Thomas Randolph ,
1st Earl of Moray recaptured the castle .
John Barbour 's narrative poem
The Brus relates how a party of thirty hand - picked men were guided by one William Francis , a member of the garrison who knew of a route along the north face of the Castle Rock and a place where the wall might be scaled .
Making the difficult ascent , Randolph 's men scaled the wall , surprised the garrison and took control .
Robert the Bruce immediately ordered the destruction of the castle 's defences to prevent its re - occupation by the English .
Four months later , his army secured victory at the Battle of Bannockburn .
After Bruce 's death in 1329 , Edward III of England determined to renew the attempted subjugation of Scotland and supported the claim of Edward Balliol , son of the former King John Balliol , over that of Bruce 's young son David II .
Edward invaded in 1333 , marking the start of the Second War of Scottish Independence , and the English forces reoccupied and refortified Edinburgh Castle in 1335 , holding it until 1341 .
This time , the Scottish assault was led by William Douglas , Lord of Liddesdale .
Douglas 's party disguised themselves as merchants from Leith bringing supplies to the garrison .
Driving a cart into the entrance , they halted it there to prevent the gates closing .
A larger force hidden nearby rushed to join them and the castle was retaken .
The English garrison , numbering 100 , were all killed .
DAVID 'S TOWER AND THE 15TH CENTURY Section::::David 's Tower and the 15th century .
The 1357 Treaty of Berwick brought the Wars of Independence to a close .
David II resumed his rule and set about rebuilding Edinburgh Castle which became his principal seat of government .
David 's Tower was begun around 1367 , and was incomplete when David died at the castle in 1371 .
It was completed by his successor , Robert II , in the 1370s .
The tower stood on the site of the present Half Moon Battery and was connected by a section of curtain wall to the smaller Constable 's Tower , a round tower built between 1375 and 1379 where the Portcullis Gate now stands .
In the early 15th century , another English invasion , this time under Henry IV , reached Edinburgh Castle and began a siege , but eventually withdrew due to lack of supplies .
From 1437 , Sir William Crichton was Keeper of Edinburgh Castle , and soon after became Chancellor of Scotland .
In an attempt to gain the regency of Scotland , Crichton sought to break the power of the Douglases , the principal noble family in the kingdom .
The sixteen - year - old William Douglas , 6th Earl of Douglas and his younger brother David were summoned to Edinburgh Castle in November 1440 .
After the so - called " Black Dinner " had taken place in David 's Tower , both boys were summarily executed on trumped - up charges in the presence of the ten - year - old King James II ( r.1437–1460 ) .
Douglas ' supporters subsequently besieged the castle , inflicting damage .
Construction continued throughout this period , with the area now known as Crown Square being laid out over vaults in the 1430s .
Royal apartments were built , forming the nucleus of the later palace block , and a Great Hall was in existence by 1458 .
In 1464 , access to the castle was improved when the current approach road up the north - east side of the rock was created to allow easier movement of the royal artillery train in and out of the area now known as the Upper Ward .
In 1479 , Alexander Stewart , Duke of Albany , was imprisoned in David 's Tower for plotting against his brother , King James III ( r.1460–1488 ) .
He escaped by getting his guards drunk , then lowering himself from a window on a rope .
Albany fled to France , then England , where he allied himself with King Edward IV .
In 1482 , Albany marched into Scotland with Richard , Duke of Gloucester ( later King Richard III ) and an English army .
James III was trapped in the castle from 22 July to 29 September 1482 until he successfully negotiated a settlement .
During the 15th century the castle was increasingly used as an arsenal and armaments factory .
The first known purchase of a gun was in 1384 , and the " great bombard " Mons Meg was delivered to Edinburgh in 1457 .
The first recorded mention of an armoury for the manufacture of guns occurs in 1474 , and by 1498 the master gunner Robert Borthwick was casting bronze guns at Edinburgh .
By 1511 Edinburgh was the principal foundry in Scotland , supplanting Stirling Castle , with Scottish and European smiths working under Borthwick , who by 1512 was appointed " master melter of the king 's guns " .
Their output included guns for the Scottish flagship , the " Great Michael " , and the " Seven Sisters " , a set of cannon captured by the English at Flodden in 1513 .
Sir Thomas Howard , England 's Lord Admiral , admired their graceful shape and brilliant finish , declaring them the most beautiful [ cannon ] for their size and length that he had ever seen .
From 1510 Dutch craftsmen were also producing hand culverins , an early firearm .
After Flodden , Borthwick continued his work , producing an unknown number of guns , of which none survive .
He was succeeded by French smiths , who began manufacturing hagbuts ( another type of firearm ) in the 1550s , and by 1541 the castle had a stock of 413 .
Meanwhile , the royal family began to stay more frequently at the Abbey of Holyrood , about from the castle .
Around the end of the fifteenth century , King James IV ( r.1488–1513 ) built Holyroodhouse , by the abbey , as his principal Edinburgh residence , and the castle 's role as a royal home subsequently declined .
James IV did , however , construct the Great Hall , which was completed in the early 16th century .
16TH CENTURY AND THE LANG SIEGE Section::::16th century and the Lang Siege .
James IV was killed in battle at Flodden Field , on 9 September 1513 .
Expecting the English to press their advantage , the Scots hastily constructed a town wall around Edinburgh and augmented the castle 's defences .
Robert Borthwick and a Frenchman , Antoine d'Arces , were involved in designing new artillery defences and fortifications in 1514 , though it appears from lack of evidence that little of the planned work was carried out .
Three years later , King James V ( r.1513–1542 ) , still only five years old , was brought to the castle for safety .
Upon his death 25 years later , the crown passed to his week - old daughter , Mary , Queen of Scots .
English invasions followed , as King Henry VIII attempted to force a dynastic marriage on Scotland , although Edinburgh Castle remained largely unaffected .
Following these campaigns , refortifications included an earthen angle - bastion , known as the Spur , of the type known as trace italienne , one of the earliest examples in Britain .
It may have been designed by Migliorino Ubaldini , an Italian engineer from the court of Henry II of France , and was said to have the arms of France carved on it .
James V 's widow , Mary of Guise , acted as regent from 1554 until her death at the castle in 1560 .
The following year , the Catholic Mary , Queen of Scots , returned from France to begin her reign , which was marred by crises and quarrels amongst the powerful Protestant Scottish nobility .
In 1565 , the Queen made an unpopular marriage with Henry Stuart , Lord Darnley , and the following year , in a small room of the Palace at Edinburgh Castle , she gave birth to their son James , who would later be King of both Scotland and England .
Mary 's reign was , however , brought to an abrupt end .
Three months after the murder of Darnley at Kirk o ' Field in 1567 , she married James Hepburn , 4th Earl of Bothwell , one of the chief murder suspects .
A large proportion of the nobility rebelled , resulting ultimately in the imprisonment and forced abdication of Mary at Loch Leven Castle .
She escaped and fled to England , but some of the nobility remained faithful to her cause .
Edinburgh Castle was initially handed by its Captain , James Balfour , to the Regent Moray , who had forced Mary 's abdication and now held power in the name of the infant King James VI .
Shortly after the Battle of Langside , in May 1568 , Moray appointed Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange Keeper of the Castle .
Grange was a trusted lieutenant of the Regent , but after Moray 's murder in January 1570 his allegiance to the King 's cause began to waver .
Intermittent civil war continued between the supporters of the two monarchs , and in April 1571 Dumbarton Castle fell to " the King 's men " .
Under the influence of William Maitland of Lethington , Mary 's secretary , Grange changed sides , occupying the town and castle of Edinburgh for Queen Mary , and against the new regent , the Earl of Lennox .
The stand - off which followed was not resolved until two years later , and became known as the " Lang Siege " , from the Scots word for " long " .
Hostilities began in May , with a month - long siege of the town , and a second short siege in October .
Blockades and skirmishing continued meanwhile , and Grange continued to refortify the castle .
The King 's party appealed to Elizabeth I of England for assistance , as they lacked the artillery and money required to reduce the castle , and feared that Grange would receive aid from France and the Duke of Alba in the Spanish Netherlands .
Elizabeth sent ambassadors to negotiate , and in July 1572 a truce was agreed and the blockade lifted .
The town was effectively surrendered to the King 's party , with Grange confined to the castle .
The truce expired on 1 January 1573 , and Grange began bombarding the town .
His supplies of powder and shot , however , were running low , and despite having 40 cannon available , there were only seven gunners in the garrison .
The King 's forces , now with the Earl of Morton in charge as regent , were making headway with plans for a siege .
Trenches were dug to surround the castle , and St Margaret 's Well was poisoned .
By February , all Queen Mary 's other supporters had surrendered to the Regent , but Grange resolved to resist despite water shortages within the castle .
The garrison continued to bombard the town , killing a number of citizens .
They also made sorties to set fires , burning 100 houses in the town and then firing on anyone attempting to put out the flames .
In April , a force of around 1,000 English troops , led by Sir William Drury , arrived in Edinburgh .
They were followed by 27 cannon from Berwick - upon - Tweed , including one that had been cast within Edinburgh Castle and captured by the English at Flodden .
The English troops built an artillery emplacement on Castle Hill , immediately facing the east walls of the castle , and five others to the north , west and south .
By 17 May these batteries were ready , and the bombardment began .
Over the next 12 days the gunners dispatched around 3,000 shots at the castle .
On 22 May , the south wall of David 's Tower collapsed , and the next day the Constable 's Tower also fell .
The debris blocked the castle entrance , as well as the Fore
Well , although this had already run dry .
On 26 May , the English attacked and captured the Spur , the outer fortification of the castle , which had been isolated by the collapse .
The following day Grange emerged from the castle by a ladder after calling for a ceasefire to allow negotiations for a surrender to take place .
When it was made clear that he would not be allowed to go free even if he ended the siege , Grange resolved to continue the resistance , but the garrison threatened to mutiny .
He therefore arranged for Drury and his men to enter the castle on 28 May , preferring to surrender to the English rather than the Regent Morton .
Edinburgh Castle was handed over to George Douglas of Parkhead , the Regent 's brother , and the garrison were allowed to go free .
In contrast , Kirkcaldy of Grange , his brother James and two jewellers , James Mossman and James Cokke , who had been minting coins in Mary 's name inside the castle , were hanged at the Cross in Edinburgh on 3 August .
NOVA SCOTIA AND CIVIL WAR Section::::Nova Scotia and Civil War .
Much of the castle was subsequently rebuilt by Regent Morton , including the Spur , the new Half Moon Battery and the Portcullis Gate .
Some of these works were supervised by William MacDowall , the master of work who fifteen years earlier had repaired David 's Tower .
The Half Moon Battery , while impressive in size , is considered by historians to have been an ineffective and outdated artillery fortification .
This may have been due to a shortage of resources , although the battery 's position obscuring the ancient David 's Tower and enhancing the prominence of the palace block , has been seen as a significant decision .
The battered palace block remained unused , particularly after James VI departed to become King of England in 1603 .
James had repairs carried out in 1584 , and in 1615–1616 more extensive repairs were carried out in preparation for his return visit to Scotland .
The mason William Wallace and master of works James Murray introduced an early Scottish example of the double - pile block .
The principal external features were the three , three - storey oriel windows on the east façade , facing the town and emphasising that this was a palace rather than just a place of defence .
During his visit in 1617 , James held court in the refurbished palace block , but still preferred to sleep at Holyrood .
In 1621 , King James granted Sir William Alexander the land in North America between New England and Newfoundland , as Nova Scotia ( " New Scotland " ) .
To promote the settlement and plantation of the new territory , the Baronetage of Nova Scotia was created in 1624 .
Under Scots Law , baronets had to " take sasine " by symbolically receiving the earth and stone of the land of which they were baronet .
To make this possible , since Nova Scotia was so distant , the King declared that sasine could be taken either in the new province or alternatively " at the castle of Edinburgh as the most eminent and principal place of Scotland . "
James ' successor , King Charles I , visited Edinburgh Castle only once , hosting a feast in the Great Hall and staying the night before his Scottish coronation in 1633 .
This was the last occasion that a reigning monarch resided in the castle .
In 1639 , in response to Charles ' attempts to impose Episcopacy on the Scottish Church , civil war broke out between the King 's forces and the Presbyterian Covenanters .
The Covenanters , led by Alexander Leslie , captured Edinburgh Castle after a short siege , although it was restored to Charles after the Peace of Berwick in June the same year .
The peace was short - lived , however , and the following year the Covenanters took the castle again , this time after a three - month siege , during which the garrison ran out of supplies .
The Spur was badly damaged , and was demolished in the 1640s .
The Royalist commander James Graham , 1st Marquis of Montrose was imprisoned here after his capture in 1650 .
In May 1650 , the Covenanters signed the Treaty of Breda , allying themselves with the exiled Charles II against the English Parliamentarians , who had executed his father the previous year .
In response to the Scots proclaiming Charles King , Oliver Cromwell launched an invasion of Scotland , defeating the Covenanter army at Dunbar in September .
Edinburgh Castle was taken after a three - month siege , which caused further damage .
The Governor of the Castle , Colonel Walter Dundas , surrendered to Cromwell despite having enough supplies to hold out , allegedly from a desire to change sides .
GARRISON FORTRESS : JACOBITES AND PRISONERS OF WAR Section::::Garrison fortress : Jacobites and prisoners of war .
After his Restoration in 1660 , Charles II opted to maintain a full - time standing army based on Cromwell 's New Model Army .
From this time until 1923 , a garrison was continuously maintained at the castle .
The medieval royal castle was transformed into a garrison fortress , but continued to see military and political action .
The Marquis of Argyll was imprisoned here in 1661 , when King Charles II settled old scores with his enemies following his return to the throne .
Twenty years later , Argyll 's son , the 9th Earl of Argyll , was also imprisoned in the castle for religious Nonconformism in the reign of King James VII .
He escaped by disguising himself as his sister 's footman , but was recaptured and returned to the castle after his failed rebellion to oust James from the throne in 1685 .
James VII was deposed and exiled by the Glorious Revolution of 1688 , which installed William of Orange as King of England .
Not long after , in early 1689 , the Estates of Scotland , after convening to accept William formally as their new king , demanded that Duke of Gordon , Governor of the Castle , surrender the fortress .
Gordon , who had been appointed by James VII as a fellow Catholic , refused .
In March 1689 , the castle was blockaded by 7,000 troops against a garrison of 160 men , further weakened by religious disputes .
On 18 March , Viscount Dundee , intent on raising a rebellion in the Highlands , climbed up the western side of the Castle Rock to urge Gordon to hold the castle against the new King .
Gordon agreed , but during the ensuing siege he refused to fire upon the town , while the besiegers inflicted little damage on the castle .
Despite Dundee 's initial successes in the north , Gordon eventually surrendered on 14 June , due to dwindling supplies and having lost 70 men during the three - month siege .
Under the terms of the Acts of Union , which joined England and Scotland in 1707 , Edinburgh was one of the four Scottish castles to be maintained and permanently garrisoned by the new British Army , the others being Stirling , Dumbarton and Blackness .
The castle was almost taken in the first Jacobite rising in support of James Stuart , the " Old Pretender " , in 1715 .
On 8 September , just two days after the rising began , a party of around 100 Jacobite Highlanders , led by Lord Drummond , attempted to scale the walls with the assistance of members of the garrison .
However , the rope ladder lowered by the castle sentries was too short , and the alarm was raised after a change of the watch .
The Jacobites fled , while the deserters within the castle were hanged or flogged .
In 1728 , General Wade reported that the castle 's defences were decayed and inadequate , and a major strengthening of the defences was carried out throughout the 1720s and 1730s .
This was the period when most of the artillery defences and bastions on the north and west sides of the castle were built .
These were designed by military engineer Captain John Romer , and built by the architect William Adam .
They include the Argyle Battery , Mills Mount Battery , the Low Defences and the Western Defences .
The last military action at the castle took place during the second Jacobite rising of 1745 .
The Jacobite army , under Charles Edward Stuart ( " Bonnie Prince Charlie " ) , captured Edinburgh without a fight in September 1745 , but the castle remained in the hands of its ageing Deputy Governor , General George Preston , who refused to surrender .
After their victory over the government army at Prestonpans on 21 September , the Jacobites attempted to blockade the castle .
Preston 's response was to bombard Jacobite positions within the town .
After several buildings had been demolished and four people killed , Charles called off the blockade .
The Jacobites themselves had no heavy guns with which to respond , and by November they had marched into England , leaving Edinburgh to the castle garrison .
Over the next century , the castle vaults were used to hold prisoners of war during several conflicts , including the Seven Years ' War ( 1756–1763 ) , the American War of Independence ( 1775–1783 ) and the Napoleonic Wars ( 1803–1815 ) .
During this time , several new buildings were erected within the castle , including powder magazines , stores , the Governor 's House ( 1742 ) , and the New Barracks ( 1796–1799 ) . 19TH CENTURY TO THE PRESENT Section::::19th century to the present .
A mass prison break in 1811 , in which 49 prisoners of war escaped via a hole in the south wall , persuaded the authorities that the castle vaults were no longer suitable as a prison .
This use ceased in 1814 and the castle began gradually to assume a different role as a national monument .
In 1818 , Sir Walter Scott was given permission to search the castle for the Crown of Scotland , believed lost after the union of Scotland and England in 1707 .
Breaking into a sealed room , now known as the Crown Room , and unlocking a chest within , he rediscovered the Honours of Scotland , which were then put on public display with an entry charge of one shilling .
In 1822 , King George IV made a visit to Edinburgh , becoming the first reigning monarch to visit the castle since Charles II in 1651 .
In 1829 , the cannon Mons Meg was returned from the Tower of London , where it had been taken as part of the process of disarming Scotland after " the ' 45 " , and the palace began to be opened up to visitors during the 1830s .
St Margaret 's Chapel was " rediscovered " in 1845 , having been used as a store for many years .
Works in the 1880s , funded by the Edinburgh publisher William Nelson and carried out by Hippolyte Blanc , saw the Argyle Tower built over the Portcullis Gate and the Great Hall restored after years of use as a barracks .
A new Gatehouse was built in 1888 .
During the 19th century , several schemes were put forward for rebuilding the whole castle as a Scottish Baronial style château .
Work began in 1858 , but was soon abandoned , and only the hospital building was eventually remodelled in 1897 .
Following the death of Prince Albert in 1861 , the architect David Bryce put forward a proposal for a keep as a memorial , but Queen Victoria objected and the scheme was not pursued .
In 1905 , responsibility for the castle was transferred from the War Office to the Office of Works , although the garrison remained until 1923 , when the troops moved to Redford Barracks in south - west Edinburgh .
The castle was again used as a prison during the First World War , when " Red Clydesider " David Kirkwood was confined in the military prison block , and during the Second World War , when downed German Luftwaffe pilots were captured .
The position of Governor of Edinburgh Castle , vacant since 1876 , was revived in 1935 as an honorary title for the General Officer Commanding in Scotland , the first holder being Lieutenant - General Sir Archibald Cameron of Lochiel .
The castle passed into the care of Historic Scotland when it was established in 1991 , and was designated a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1993 .
The buildings and structures of the castle are further protected by 24 separate listings , including 13 at category A , the highest level of protection for a historic building in Scotland .
The Old and New Towns of Edinburgh , a World Heritage Site inscribed by UNESCO in 1995 , is described as " dominated by a medieval fortress " .
DESCRIPTION Section::::Description .
Edinburgh Castle is located at the top of the Royal Mile , at the west end of Edinburgh 's Old Town .
The volcanic Castle Rock offers a naturally defended position , with sheer cliffs to north and south , and a steep ascent from the west .
The only easy approach is from the town to the east , and the castle 's defences are situated accordingly , with a series of gates protecting the route to the summit of the Castle Rock .
OUTER DEFENCES Section::::Outer defences .
In front of the castle is a long sloping forecourt known as the Esplanade .
Originally the Spur , a 16th - century hornwork , was located here .
The present Esplanade was laid out as a parade ground in 1753 , and extended in 1845 .
It is upon this Esplanade that the Edinburgh Military Tattoo takes place annually .
From the Esplanade the Half Moon Battery is prominent , with the Royal Palace to its left .
The Gatehouse at the head of the Esplanade was built as an architecturally cosmetic addition to the castle in 1888 .
Statues of Robert the Bruce by Thomas Clapperton and William Wallace by Alexander Carrick were added in 1929 , and the Latin motto Nemo me impune lacessit is inscribed above the gate .
The dry ditch in front of the entrance was completed in its present form in 1742 .
Within the Gatehouse are offices , and to the north is the most recent addition to the castle ; the ticket office , completed in 2008 to a design by Gareth Hoskins Architects .
The road , built by James III in 1464 for the transport of cannon , leads upward and around to the north of the Half Moon Battery and the Forewall Battery , to the Portcullis Gate .
In 1990 , an alternative access was opened by digging a tunnel from the north of the esplanade to the north - west part of the castle , separating visitor traffic from service traffic .
PORTCULLIS GATE AND ARGYLE TOWER Section::::Portcullis Gate and Argyle Tower .
The Portcullis Gate was begun by the Regent Morton after the Lang Siege of 1571–73 to replace the round Constable 's Tower , which was destroyed in the siege .
In 1584 the upper parts of the Gatehouse were completed by William Schaw , and these were further modified in 1750 .
In 1886–1887 this plain building was replaced with a Scots Baronial tower , designed by the architect Hippolyte Blanc , although the original Portcullis Gate remains below .
The new structure was named the Argyle Tower , from the fact that the 9th Earl of Argyll had been held here prior to his execution in 1685 .
Described as " restoration in an extreme form " , the rebuilding of the Argyle Tower was the first in a series of works funded by the publisher William Nelson .
Just inside the gate is the Argyle Battery overlooking Princes Street , with Mills Mount Battery , the location of the One O'Clock Gun , to the west .
Below these is the Low Defence , while at the base of the rock is the ruined Wellhouse Tower , built in 1362 to guard
St. Margaret 's Well .
This natural spring provided an important secondary source of water for the castle , the water being lifted up by a crane mounted on a platform known as the Crane Bastion .
MILITARY BUILDINGS Section::::Military buildings .
The areas to the north and west of the Argyle Tower are largely occupied by military buildings erected after the castle became a major garrison in the early 18th century .
Adjacent to Mills Mount are the 18th - century cart sheds , now tea rooms .
The Governor 's House to the south was built in 1742 as accommodation for the Governor , Storekeeper , and Master Gunner , and was used until the post of Governor became vacant in the later 19th century ; it was then used by nurses of the castle hospital .
Today , it functions as an officers ' mess , and as the office of the Governor since the restoration of the post in 1936 .
South of the Governor 's House are the New Barracks , completed in 1799 to house 600 soldiers , and replacing the outdated accommodation in the Great Hall .
They now house the Regimental Headquarters of the Royal Regiment of Scotland and the Regimental Headquarters of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards ( Carabiniers and Greys ) as well as the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards Museum .
The latter was opened in 1995 by the regiment 's Colonel , Queen Elizabeth II .
Also nearby , in the former Royal Scots drill hall , constructed in 1900 , is the Regimental Museum of the Royal Scots ( The Royal Regiment ) .
The military prison was built in 1842 as a detention block for the castle garrison and was extended in the 1880s .
It was last used in 1923 , when the garrison moved to the city 's Redford Barracks .
NATIONAL WAR MUSEUM OF SCOTLAND Section::::National War Museum of Scotland .
West of the Governor 's House , a store for munitions was built in 1747–48 and later extended to form a courtyard , in which the main gunpowder magazine also stood .
In 1897 the area was remodelled as a military hospital , formerly housed in the Great Hall .
The building to the south of this courtyard is now the National War Museum of Scotland , which forms part of the National Museums of Scotland .
It was formerly known as the Scottish United Services Museum , and , prior to this , the Scottish Naval and Military Museum , when it was located in the Queen Anne Building .
It covers Scotland 's military history over the past 400 years , and includes a wide range of military artefacts , such as uniforms , medals and weapons .
The exhibits also illustrate the history and causes behind the many wars in which Scottish soldiers have been involved .
Beside the museum is Butts Battery , named after the archery butts ( targets ) formerly placed here .
Below it are the Western Defences , where a postern , named the West Sally Port , gives access to the western slope of the rock .
UPPER WARD Section::::Upper Ward .
The Upper Ward or Citadel occupies the highest part of the Castle Rock , and is entered via the late 17th - century Foog 's Gate .
The origin of this name is unknown , although it was formerly known as the Foggy Gate , which may relate to the dense sea - fogs , known as haars , which commonly affect Edinburgh .
Adjacent to the gates are the large cisterns built to reduce the castle 's dependency on well water and a former fire station , now used as a shop .
The summit of the rock is occupied by St Margaret 's Chapel and 15th - century siege gun Mons Meg .
On a ledge below this area is a small 19th - century Dogs ' Cemetery for the burial of the soldiers ' regimental mascots .
Beside this , the Lang Stair leads down to the Argyle Battery , past a section of a medieval bastion , and gives access to the upper storey of the Argyle Tower .
The eastern end of the Upper Ward is occupied by the Forewall and Half Moon Batteries , with Crown Square to the south .
ST .
MARGARET 'S CHAPEL
Section::::St .
Margaret 's Chapel .
The oldest building in the castle , and in Edinburgh , is the small St. Margaret 's Chapel .
One of the few 12th - century structures surviving in any Scottish castle , it dates from the reign of King David I ( r.1124–1153 ) , who built it as a private chapel for the royal family and dedicated it to his mother , Saint Margaret of Scotland , who died in the castle in 1093 .
It survived the slighting of 1314 , when the castle 's defences were destroyed on the orders of Robert the Bruce , and was used as a gunpowder store from the 16th century , when the present roof was built .
In 1845 , it was " discovered " by the antiquary Daniel Wilson , while in use as part of the larger garrison chapel , and was restored in 1851–1852 .
The chapel is still used for religious ceremonies , such as weddings .
MONS MEG
Section::::Mons Meg .
The 15th - century siege gun or bombard known as Mons Meg is displayed on a terrace in front of St. Margaret 's Chapel .
She was constructed in Flanders on the orders of Philip III , Duke of Burgundy in 1449 , and given as a gift to King James II , the husband of his niece , in 1457 .
The gun rests on a reconstructed carriage , the details of which were copied from an old stone relief that can be seen inside the tunnel of the Gatehouse at the castle entrance .
Some of Meg 's large gun stones , weighing around each , are displayed alongside her .
On 3 July 1558 , she was fired in salute to celebrate the marriage of Mary , Queen of Scots to the French dauphin , François II .
The royal Treasurer 's Accounts of the time record a payment to soldiers for retrieving one of her stones from Wardie Muir near the River Forth , fully from the castle .
The gun has been defunct since her barrel burst while firing a salute to greet the Duke of Albany , the future King James VII and II , on his arrival in Edinburgh on 30 October 1681 .
HALF MOON BATTERY AND DAVID 'S TOWER Section::::Half Moon Battery and David 's Tower .
The Half Moon Battery , which remains a prominent feature on the east side of the castle , was built as part of the reconstruction works supervised by the Regent Morton , and was erected between 1573 and 1588 .
The Forewall to the north was built between 1689 and 1695 to link the Half Moon to the Portcullis Tower , although part of the original wall of 1540 was incorporated into it .
The Half Moon Battery was built around and over the ruins of David 's Tower , two storeys of which survive beneath , with windows facing out onto the interior wall of the battery .
David 's Tower was built on an L - plan , the main block being , with a wing measuring to the west .
The entrance was via a pointed - arched doorway in the inner angle , although in the 16th century this was filled in to make the tower a solid rectangle .
Prior to the Lang Siege , the tower was recorded as being high , and the remaining portions stand up to from the rock .
The tower was rediscovered during routine maintenance work in 1912 , and excavations below the Half Moon Battery revealed the extent of the surviving buildings .
Several rooms are accessible to the public , although the lower parts are generally closed .
Outside the tower , but within the battery , is a three - storey room , where large portions of the exterior wall of the tower are still visible , showing shattered masonry caused by the bombardment of 1573 .
Beside the tower , a section of the former curtain wall was discovered , with a gun loop which overlooked the High Street : a recess was made in the outer battery wall to reveal this gun loop .
Also in 1912–1913 , the adjacent Fore Well was cleared and surveyed , and was found to be deep , and mostly hewn through the rock below the castle .
CROWN
SQUARE Section::::Crown Square .
Crown Square , also known as Palace Yard , was laid out in the 15th century , during the reign of King James III , as the principal courtyard of the castle .
The foundations were formed by the construction of a series of large stone vaults built onto the uneven Castle Rock in the 1430s .
These vaults were used as a state prison until the 19th century , although more important prisoners were held in the main parts of the castle .
The square is formed by the Royal Palace to the east , the Great Hall to the south , the Queen Anne Building to the west , and the National War Memorial to the north .
ROYAL PALACE Section::::Royal Palace .
The Royal Palace comprises the former royal apartments , which were the residence of the later Stewart monarchs .
It was begun in the mid 15th century , during the reign of James IV , and it originally communicated with David 's Tower .
The building was extensively remodelled for the visit of James VI to the castle in 1617 , when state apartments for the King and Queen were built .
On the ground floor is the Laich ( low ) Hall , now called the King 's Dining Room , and a small room , known as the Birth Chamber or Mary Room , where James VI was born to Mary , Queen of Scots , in June 1566 .
The commemorative painted ceiling and other decoration were added in 1617 .
On the first floor is the vaulted Crown Room , built in 1615 to house the Honours of Scotland : the crown , the sceptre and the sword of state .
The Stone of Scone , upon which the monarchs of Scotland were traditionally crowned , has been kept in the Crown Room since its return to Scotland in 1996 .
To the south of the palace is the Register House , built in the 1540s to accommodate state archives .
GREAT HALL Section::::Great Hall .
The Great Hall measures , and was the chief place of state assembly in the castle , although there is no evidence that the Parliament of Scotland ever met here , as is sometimes reported .
Historians have disagreed over its dating , although it is usually ascribed to the reign of King James IV , and is thought to have been completed in the early years of the 16th century .
The decorative carved stone corbels supporting the roof have Renaissance detailing , which has been compared to works at Blois , France , of around 1515 , indicating that the arts in Scotland were relatively advanced at this time .
It is one of only two medieval halls in Scotland with an original hammerbeam roof .
Following Oliver Cromwell 's seizure of the castle in 1650 , the Great Hall was converted into a barracks for his troops ; and in 1737 it was subdivided into three storeys to house 312 soldiers .
Following the construction of the New Barracks in the 1790s , it became a military hospital until 1897 .
It was then restored by Hippolyte Blanc in line with contemporary ideas of medieval architecture .
The Great Hall is still occasionally used for ceremonial occasions , and has been used as a venue on Hogmanay for BBC Scotland 's Hogmanay Live programme .
To the south of the hall is a section of curtain wall from the 14th century with a parapet of later date .
QUEEN ANNE BUILDING Section::::Queen Anne Building .
In the 16th century , this area housed the kitchens serving the adjacent Great Hall , and was later the site of the Royal Gunhouse .
The present building was named after Queen Anne and was built during the attempted Jacobite invasion by the Old Pretender in 1708 .
It was designed by Captain Theodore Dury , military engineer for Scotland , who also designed Dury 's Battery , named in his honour , on the south side of the castle in 1713 .
The Queen Anne Building provided accommodation for Staff Officers , but after the departure of the Army it was remodelled in the 1920s as the Naval and Military Museum , to complement the newly opened Scottish National War Memorial .
The museum later moved to the former hospital in the western part of the castle , and the building now houses a function suite and an education centre .
SCOTTISH NATIONAL WAR MEMORIAL Section::::Scottish National War Memorial .
The Scottish National War Memorial occupies a converted barrack block on the north side of Crown Square .
It stands on the site of the medieval St. Mary 's Church which was rebuilt in 1366 , and was converted into an armoury in 1540 .
It was demolished in 1755 , and the masonry reused to build a new North Barrack Block on the site .
Proposals for a Scottish National War Memorial were put forward in 1917 , during the First World War , and the architect Sir Robert Lorimer was appointed in 1919 .
Construction began in 1923 , and the memorial was formally opened on 14 July 1927 by the Prince of Wales .
The exterior is decorated with gargoyles and sculpture , while the interior contains monuments to individual regiments .
The stained - glass windows are by Douglas Strachan .
The memorial commemorates Scottish soldiers , and those serving with Scottish regiments , who died in the two world wars and in more recent conflicts .
Upon the altar within the Shrine , placed upon the highest point of the Castle Rock , is a sealed casket containing Rolls of Honour which list over 147,000 names of those soldiers killed in the First World War .
After the Second World War , another 50,000 names were inscribed on Rolls of Honour held within the Hall , and further names continue to be added there .
The memorial is maintained by a charitable trust .
PRESENT USE Section::::Present use .
Edinburgh Castle is in the ownership of the Scottish Ministers as heads of the devolved Scottish Government .
The castle is run and administered , for the most part , by Historic Scotland , an executive agency of the Scottish Government , although the Army remains responsible for some areas , including the New Barracks block and the military museums .
Both Historic Scotland and the Army share use of the Guardroom immediately inside the castle entrance .
TOURIST ATTRACTION Section::::Tourist attraction .
Historic Scotland undertakes the dual tasks of operating the castle as a commercially viable tourist attraction , while simultaneously bearing responsibility for conservation of the site .
Edinburgh Castle remains the most popular paid visitor attraction in Scotland , with over 1.4 million visitors in 2013 .
Historic Scotland maintains a number of facilities within the castle , including two cafés / restaurants , several shops , and numerous historical displays .
An educational centre in the Queen Anne Building runs events for schools and educational groups , and employs re - enactors in costume and with period weaponry .
MILITARY ROLE
Section::::Military role .
Direct administration of the castle by the War Office came to an end in 1905 , and in 1923 the Army formally moved to the city 's new Redford Barracks .
Nevertheless , the castle continues to have a strong connection with the Army , and is one of the few ancient castles in Britain that still has a military garrison , albeit for largely ceremonial and administrative purposes .
Public duties performed by the garrison include guarding the Honours of Scotland , and armed sentries stand watch at the Gatehouse outside opening hours .
The post of Governor of Edinburgh Castle is now a ceremonial post , held by the General Officer Commanding Scotland .
The New Barracks contain both the Governor 's House , which serves as the Officers ' Mess , and the Regimental Headquarters of the Royal Regiment of Scotland .
The Army retains responsibility for these and for the Royal Scots Museum and Royal Scots Dragoon Guards Museum .
MILITARY TATTOO Section::::Military tattoo .
A series of performances known as the Edinburgh Military Tattoo ( since 2010 the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo ) takes place on the Esplanade each year during August .
The basis of each performance is a parade of the massed pipes and drums of the Scottish regiments , and since its inception in 1950 the tattoo has developed a complex format which includes a variety of performers invited from around the world , although still with a largely military focus .
The climax of the evening is the lone piper on the castle battlements , playing a pibroch in memory of dead comrades - in - arms , followed by massed bands joining in a medley of traditional Scottish tunes .
The tattoo attracts an annual audience of around 217,000 people , and is broadcast in some 30 countries to a television audience estimated at 100 million .
ONE
O'CLOCK
GUN Section::::One O'Clock Gun .
The One O'Clock Gun is a time signal , fired every day at precisely 13:00 , excepting Sunday , Good Friday and Christmas Day .
The ' Time Gun ' was established in 1861 as a time signal for ships in the harbour of Leith and the Firth of Forth , away .
It complemented the ' Time Ball ' , which was installed on the Nelson Monument in 1852 , but was useless as a visual signal in foggy weather .
Because sound travels relatively slowly ( approximately ) , a map was produced in 1861 to show the actual time when the sound of the gun would be heard at various locations across Edinburgh .
The original gun was an 18-pound muzzle - loading cannon , which needed four men to load , and was fired from the Half Moon Battery .
This was replaced in 1913 by a 32-pound breech - loader , and in May 1952 by a 25-pound Howitzer .
The present One O'Clock Gun is an L118 Light Gun , brought into service on 30 November 2001 .
On Sunday 2 April 1916 , the One O'Clock Gun was fired in vain at a German Zeppelin during an air raid , the gun 's only known use in war .
The gun is now fired from Mill 's Mount Battery , on the north face of the castle , by the District Gunner from the 105th Regiment Royal Artillery ( Volunteers ) .
Although the gun is no longer required for its original purpose , the ceremony has become a popular tourist attraction .
The longest - serving District Gunner , Staff Sergeant Thomas McKay MBE , nicknamed " Tam the Gun " , fired the One O'Clock Gun from 1979 until his retirement in January 2005 .
McKay helped establish the One O'Clock Gun Association , which opened a small exhibition at Mill 's Mount , and published a book entitled What Time Does Edinburgh 's One O'clock Gun Fire ? .
In 2006 Sergeant Jamie Shannon , nicknamed " Shannon the Cannon " , became the 29th District Gunner , and in 2006 Bombardier Allison Jones became the first woman to fire the gun .
SYMBOL OF EDINBURGH Section::::Symbol of Edinburgh .
The castle has become a recognisable symbol of Edinburgh , and of Scotland .
It appears , in stylised form , on the coats of arms of the City of Edinburgh and the University of Edinburgh .
It also features on the badge of No . 603 ( City of Edinburgh ) Squadron which was based at RAF Turnhouse ( now Edinburgh Airport ) during Second World War .
Images of the castle are used as a logo by organisations including Edinburgh Rugby , the Edinburgh Evening News , Hibernian F.C. and the Edinburgh Marathon .
It also appears on the " Castle series " of Royal Mail postage stamps , and has been represented on various issues of banknotes issued by Scottish clearing banks .
In the 1960s the castle was illustrated on £ 5 notes issued by the National Commercial Bank of Scotland , and since 1987 it has featured on the reverse of £ 1 notes issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland .
Since 2009 the castle , as part of Edinburgh 's World Heritage Site , has appeared on £ 10 notes issued by the Clydesdale Bank .
The castle is a focal point for annual fireworks displays which mark Edinburgh 's Hogmanay ( new year ) celebrations , and the end of the Edinburgh Festival in the summer .
