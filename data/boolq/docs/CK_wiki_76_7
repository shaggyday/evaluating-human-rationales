CORN CHIP
A corn chip is a snack food made from cornmeal fried in oil or baked , usually in the shape of a small noodle or scoop .
Corn chips are thick , rigid and very crunchy .
Corn chips have the strong aroma and flavor of roasted corn , and are often heavily seasoned with salt .
In the US , Fritos is one of the oldest and most widely recognized brands of corn chips .
While corn chips and tortilla chips are both made from corn , the corn in tortilla chips is subjected to the nixtamalization process , resulting in a milder flavor and aroma , and a less rigid texture .
Tortilla chips also tend to be larger , thinner , and less salty than corn chips .
Corn chips are usually eaten alone or with a chip dip .
They are a common ingredient in homemade and commercial party mix .
In the Southwestern US , a popular dish , Frito pie , is made with corn chips and chili .
In some areas , it is popular to pour the chili into a bag of corn chips and eat the mixture directly from the bag .
