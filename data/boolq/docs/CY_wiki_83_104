CLACHAN BRIDGE
The Clachan Bridge is a simple , single - arched , hump - backed , masonry bridge spanning the Clachan Sound , southwest of Oban in Argyll , Scotland .
It links the west coast of the Scottish mainland to the island of Seil .
The bridge was originally designed by John Stevenson of Oban ( and not by Thomas Telford as sometimes quoted ) and was built between 1792 and 1793 by engineer Robert Mylne .
The original design had two arches , but it was finally built with a single high arch , of roughly span and about above the bed of the channel , to allow the passage of vessels of up to at high tide .
The bridge is still in use today , forming part of the B844 road , and is in the care of Historic Scotland .
Because the Clachan Sound connects at both ends to the Atlantic Ocean , and might therefore be considered part of that ocean , the bridge came to be known as the Bridge over the Atlantic .
Such an appellation has also been applied to certain other bridges having similar situations , such as the bridge between Norðskáli and Oyri in the Faroe Islands and between Lewis and Great Bernera in the Outer Hebrides .
