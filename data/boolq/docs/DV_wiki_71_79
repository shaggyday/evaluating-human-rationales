DEBIT NOTE
A debit note or debit memorandum ( memo ) is a commercial document issued by a buyer to a seller as a means of formally requesting a credit note .
Debit note acts as the Source document to the Purchase returns journal .
In other words it is an evidence for the occurrence of a reduction in expenses .
The seller might also issue a debit note instead of an invoice in order to adjust upwards the amount of an invoice already issued ( as if the invoice is recorded in wrong value ) .
Debit notes are generally used in business - to - business transactions .
Such transactions often involve an extension of credit , meaning that a vendor would send a shipment of goods to a company before the goods have been paid for .
Although real goods are changing hands , until an actual invoice is issued , real money is not .
Rather , debits and credits are being logged in an accounting system to keep track of inventories shipped and payments REFERENCES
