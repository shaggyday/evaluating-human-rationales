MULTIPLE MAJOR SPORTS CHAMPIONSHIP SEASONS
In the history of North American major professional sports league championships ( which include the NFL , MLB , NBA , and NHL ) a city / metropolitan area has been home to multiple championships in a season fifteen times , most recently in 2008 - 2009 , when the Pittsburgh Penguins and Pittsburgh Steelers won their respective leagues , in February and June 2009 .
Only Detroit has been host to more than two major league championship teams in a season , although in 2002 Los Angeles metropolitan area 's Lakers and Angels won the NBA and MLB championships along with two other local teams of smaller leagues ( the Sparks of the WNBA and the Galaxy of the MLS ) .
Super Bowls take place in the February after the NFL 's regular season .
The Super Bowl used to be in January .
Therefore , Super Bowl I — which took place January 15 , 1967—is officially the championship game for the 1966 season .
In the calendar year 2009 , Pittsburgh 's Steelers and Penguins won their respective championships , but the Steelers ' championship was for the NFL 's 2008 regular season .
However , before 1965 , the NFL championship game was played in December of that calendar year .
That being said , both of those seasons started in 2008 and ended in 2009 .
Therefore , Pittsburgh was in fact the most recent city to win multiple championships in the same season .
On the other hand , Super Bowl III , won by the New York Jets of the AFL on January 12 , 1969 , is counted towards the 1968 season , disqualifying consideration of 3 titles in New York City in 1969 .
All four of Philadelphia 's major professional sports teams played in the championship game or series , in their respective sports , following the 1980 season : The 1980 Philadelphia Phillies won the World Series , while the 1980 Philadelphia Eagles lost Super Bowl XV , the 1979 - 80 Philadelphia 76ers lost the NBA Finals , and the 1979 - 80 Philadelphia Flyers lost the Stanley Cup Finals .
