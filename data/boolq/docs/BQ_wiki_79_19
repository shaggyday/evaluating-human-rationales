HISTORY
EARLY 20TH CENTURY Section::::History .
Section::::Early 20th century .
Jamaica 's first international appearance was against their Caribbean neighbours Haiti in 1925 .
They were invited to the French - speaking Caribbean island by Andre Chevalon , president of the United Sporting Society and it was for a three - match series between the 2 countries .
Jamaica won all three games by 1–0 , 2–1 and 3–0 .
The following year Jamaica hosted Haiti at Sabina Park and won by 6–0 .
Haiti remained frequent opponents and it was not until 1932 that their run of defeats was broken with a 4–1 home win in Port - au - Prince .
Between 1925 and when Jamaica gained its independence in 1962 , Jamaica had regular games with Trinidad and Tobago , Haiti , Cuba and clubs like Racing and Violette from Haiti , Corinthians of Britain , Tigres from Argentina , and even a series of matches with a Caribbean All Stars team in 1952 .
The Caribbean All Star team included such notables as Michael ( The Ruin ) Kruin from Suriname and also representing Jamaica were Lindy Delapenha and Gillie Heron .
The four games were shared equally with Jamaica winning the second 2–1 and the fourth 1–0 and the All Stars winning the first 5–1 and the third 1–0 .
Those friendly international games were the start of Jamaica 's football journey with most of the home matches being played at Sabina Park .
Many clubs were established during this time including Kensington , Melbourne , Kingston , Lucas and St. George 's Old Boys , thus providing the talent Jamaica needed at the times .
POST INDEPENDENCE ( 1962 )
Section::::Post independence ( 1962 ) .
In 1965 , under the leadership of Brazilian coach Jorge Penna , Jamaica made its first attempt at World Cup qualifying .
This was for the 1966 World Cup finals in England .
The preliminary group included Cuba and the Netherlands Antilles .
Jamaica 's first game was against Cuba which they won 2–0 at Jamaica 's National Stadium .
In the qualifying match against the Netherlands Antilles , Jamaica also had a 2–0 victory with both goals coming .
In the away games Jamaica was held to a goalless draw with the Netherlands Antilles and suffered an unexpected 2–1 defeat to Cuba .
Jamaica then advanced to the final group of 3 which included Costa Rica and Mexico .
The winner in this group would represent the CONCACAF region .
Jamaica lost at home to Mexico 3–2 and in the return leg in Mexico City , the high altitude proved too much for the Jamaicans and they were defeated 8–0 .
1970S Section::::1970s .
In 1968 , coach George Hamilton took leadership as Jamaica made an attempt to qualify for the 1970 World Cup Finals in Mexico .
Jamaica had only a couple remaining players from the previous World Cup team and had to rebuild because most of the players had retired or migrated to North America and England .
Jamaica lost all of their qualifying games in that year .
Jamaica 's participation in the 1973 CONCACAF Championship qualification elimination saw the suspension of 17 players on the team because of poor behaviour on a tour to Bermuda .
Jamaica withdrew from the elimination to restructure their team .
For the 1978 FIFA World Cup qualifying , Jamaica was eliminated by Cuba after two losses ( 3–1 at the National Stadium and then 2–0 in Havana ) .
1980S
Section::::1980s .
Jamaica did not participate in the qualifyings for the 1982 and 1986 World Cups , in the former due to insufficient funds and a poorly prepared team , and the later because the team was suspended for affiliation fees that were due to FIFA .
1990S Section::::1990s .
For the 1989 CONCACAF Championship qualification qualifying with coach Geoffrey Maxwell , Jamaica won both preliminary games against Puerto Rico 1–0 in Jamaica and 2–0 at Puerto Rico .
In the next round , the United States were their next opponents and the first leg was a goalless draw .
Jamaica lost the return leg in the US 5–1 , ending their qualifying attempt .
In qualification for the 1994 World Cup , Jamaica first beat Puerto Rico 2–1 and was then was put in a group with Bermuda , Canada , and El Salvador , from which two teams would advance to the final round .
Jamaica tied 1–1 with Canada and Bermuda and then lost 2–0 to El Salvador , 1–0 to Canada , 2–1 to El Salvador .
Jamaica then beat Bermuda 3–2 but did not qualify .
In 1994 , Brazilian manager René Simões was hired , along with National coach Carl Brown , with the goal of qualifying for the 1998 FIFA World Cup .
Simões searched for players – discovering some working at hotels , British players of Jamaican descent , and Jamaicans who played in English clubs – and funding .
The Jamaican team became a " Powerhouse " in the Caribbean region and received " Best Mover " award by FIFA in 1996 .
Jamaica made history in 1997 becoming the first English - speaking Caribbean country to qualify for a World Cup .

Theodore Whitmore lead the team to impressive victories over El Salvador and Guatemala in the latter part of 2007 .
However , with the return of former coach Renê Simões ( who led Jamaica to the 1998 World Cup ) , there was heavy optimism in the Reggae Boyz camps .
Jamaica started their Road To South Africa 2010 campaign in fine form beating Bahamas 7–0 at home , 6–0 away .
They then fought to a hard 1–1 draw with Canada but lost to Mexico and Honduras due to what was considered poor team selection from Renê Simões , which then in turn led to his firing .
Jamaica announced that Jamaica - born John Barnes would take over as manager in November 2008 , with former Reggae Boy Theodore Whitmore leading the team in the interim .
Jamaica were at the bottom of Group 2 in the 3rd round , but high performances saw them move up in the table .
The team battled hard to 1–0 victories over Mexico and Honduras .
However , the Boyz fell just short of advancing to the final round .
They managed an impressive 3–0 victory over Canada in their final third round match but failed to move on as Mexico advanced on goal difference after a 1–0 loss to Honduras .
After this Theodore Whitmore decided to begin early preparation for the 2014 FIFA World Cup .
They vowed to play at least one friendly a month .
The squad held South Africa to a goalless draw before 15,000 spectators at Vodacom Park , South Africa .
