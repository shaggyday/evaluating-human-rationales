URINE SPECIFIC GRAVITY Specific gravity , in the context of clinical pathology , is a urinalysis parameter commonly used in the evaluation of kidney function and can aid in the diagnosis of various renal diseases .
BACKGROUND Section::::Background .
One of the main roles of the kidneys in humans and other mammals is to aid in the clearance of various water - soluble molecules , including toxins , toxicants , and metabolic waste .
The body excretes some of these waste molecules via urination , and the role of the kidney is to concentrate the urine , such that waste molecules can be excreted with minimal loss of water and nutrients .
The concentration of the excreted molecules determines the urine 's specific gravity .
In adult humans , normal specific gravity values range from 1.010 to 1.030 .
SPECIFIC GRAVITY AND DISEASE Section::::Specific gravity and disease .
Adults generally have a specific gravity in the range of 1.010 to 1.030 Increases in specific gravity ( hypersthenuria , i.e. increased concentration of solutes in the urine ) may be associated with dehydration , diarrhea , emesis , excessive sweating , urinary tract / bladder infection , glucosuria , renal artery stenosis , hepatorenal syndrome , decreased blood flow to the kidney ( especially as a result of heart failure ) , and excess of antidiuretic hormone caused by Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone .
A specific gravity greater than 1.035 is consistent with frank dehydration .
In neonates , normal urine specific gravity is 1.003 .
Hypovolemic patients usually have a specific gravity > 1.015 .
Decreased specific gravity ( hyposthenuria
, i.e. decreased concentration of solutes in urine ) may be associated with renal failure , pyelonephritis , diabetes insipidus , acute tubular necrosis , interstitial nephritis , and excessive fluid intake ( e.g. , psychogenic polydipsia ) .
Osmolality is normally used for more detailed analysis but USG remains popular for its convenience REFERENCES
