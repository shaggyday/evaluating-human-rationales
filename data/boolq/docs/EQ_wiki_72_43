LIST OF CONNECTICUT TORNADOES
Although historically the U.S. state of Connecticut is not typically known to fall casualty to tornadoes , more than 100 of these powerful storms have affected the state in modern history , resulting in at least 48 deaths , 780 injuries , and more than $ 500 million in damage .
This list of tornadoes in the state is likely incomplete , as official records date back only to 1950 for tornadoes in the United States .
As with most of the northeastern United States , the number of tornadoes peaks in the summer months , normally in July or August .
Hartford County has had the most tornadoes in the state , although since 1950 Litchfield County has reported the most tornadoes .
Several areas have been struck more than once , and Waterbury has been struck by no less than four tornadoes since 1955 .
From 1953 to 1991 , Connecticut recorded an average of about 1.3 tornadoes per year , ranked 43rd in the United States .
Although Connecticut tornadoes are typically weak , isolated events can be violent .
Three tornadoes of F4 intensity have affected the state in its history , as well as at least 27 tornadoes of F2 intensity or greater .
Outbreaks of three or more tornadoes in a single day occurred in 1786 , 1787 , 1878 , 1973 , 1989 , 1998 , 2001 and 2018 .
The year 1973 was particularly active ; eight tornadoes occurred on six separate days .
The year 2018 has the highest number of tornadoes recorded in the state in a year , with nine total .
The 1878 Wallingford tornado killed at least 29 and likely 34 people in Wallingford , the most by any tornado event in Connecticut history .
