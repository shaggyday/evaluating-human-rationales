PUBLIC HOLIDAYS IN THE UNITED STATES
The schedule of public holidays in the United States is largely influenced by the schedule of federal holidays but is controlled by private sector employers who employ 62 % of the total US population with paid time off .
A typical work week is generally 40 hours a week with a Saturday – Sunday weekend .
Public holidays with paid time off is generally defined to occur on a day that is within the employee 's work week .
When a holiday occurs on Saturday or Sunday , that holiday is shifted to either Friday or Monday .
Most employers follow a holiday schedule similar to the federal holidays of the United States , with exceptions or additions .
The federal holiday schedule mainly benefits employees of government and government regulated businesses .
However , this sector only comprises 15 % of the working population .
At the discretion of the employer , other non - federal holidays such as Christmas Eve and the Day after Thanksgiving are common additions to the list of paid holidays while Columbus Day and Veterans Day are common omissions .
Besides paid holidays are festival and food holidays that also have wide acceptance based on sales of goods and services that are typically associated with that holiday .
Halloween and Valentine 's Day are such examples of widely celebrated uncompensated holidays .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Public holidays had their origins from established federal holidays that were enacted by Congress .
They were typically observed on days that have significance for various sectors of American society and are observed at all levels of society including government , the private sector , and are typically derived from the history , religion and the cultures of the US demographics and have changed over time .
Observances of holidays are most commonly observed with paid time off , however , many holiday celebrations are done with festivities without time off .
Some are observed with community work depending on the meaning of the holiday .
They are however not mandated by any government , agencies , whether it be federal , state , or local governments .
There are no national holidays on which all businesses are closed by law .
Federal holidays are only established for certain federally chartered and regulated businesses ( such as federal banks ) , and for Washington , DC All other public holidays are created by the States ; most states also allow local jurisdictions ( cities , villages , etc . ) to establish their own local holidays .
As a result , holidays have not historically been governed at the federal level and federal law does not govern business opening .
Some states restrict some business activities on some holidays .
Business closures are mandated on some holidays in some states for certain kinds of businesses by Blue Laws .
For example , some businesses can not open on Thanksgiving Day in some New England states if the businesses operated on more than 5000 square feet of space .
The most notable businesses to close on such occasions are car dealerships and establishments selling alcohol .
OVERVIEW Section::::Overview .
, there were eleven federal holidays in the United States , ten annual holidays and one quadrennial holiday ( Inauguration Day ) .
Pursuant to the Uniform Monday Holiday Act of 1968 ( effective 1971 ) , official holidays are observed on a Monday , except for New Year 's Day , Independence Day , Veterans Day , Thanksgiving , and Christmas .
While all current federal holidays have also been made public holidays in all 50 states for federal organizations , each state is not bound to observe the holidays on the same dates as the federal holidays .
Many states also have additional holidays that are not observed by the federal government .
Many businesses likewise observe certain holidays as well , which are also not mandated by any government agency .
A list of " recommended diversity holidays " recognizes many cultures that range from Christianity to Islam , as well as racial diversity where various ethnic holidays such as St. Patrick 's Day , Kwanzaa , Diwali , Mardi Gras , and Cinco de Mayo are celebrated by individuals in the workplace , as a matter of best practice .
In light of recent race issues in the United States , many municipalities both at the city and state levels have begun celebrating Malcolm X Day and Rosa Parks Day in addition to Martin Luther King ,
Jr. Day to embrace the mostly disenfranchised African American community in the form of festivals and parades if not done as a legal public holiday .
Illinois and Berkeley , California are two places where Malcolm X is honored with a legal holiday with offices closed whereas Missouri honored Rosa Parks on her birthday .
Today , the United States is the 85th most ethnically diverse country in the world .
While the popularity of each public holiday can not easily be measured , the holiday with the highest greeting card sales is Christmas .
Major retail establishments such as malls , shopping centers and most retail stores close only on Thanksgiving and Christmas and some on Easter Sunday as well , but remain open on all other holidays ( early closing on Christmas Eve and New Year 's Eve , and sometimes on other major holidays ) ; in the face of a rapidly tightening retail market in the 2010s , retailers have been increasingly opening on Thanksgiving to extend the holiday shopping season .
Virtually all companies observe and close on the major holidays ( New Year 's Day , Memorial Day , Independence Day , Labor Day , Thanksgiving , and Christmas ) .
Some non - retail business close on the day after Thanksgiving , while some ( such as federal banks and post offices ) are not allowed to close on the day after Thanksgiving .
Some smaller businesses normally open on Sunday will close on Easter Sunday , if it is their experience they will have very few customers that day .

K-12
public schools generally observe local , state , and federal holidays , plus additional days off around Thanksgiving , the period from before Christmas until after New Year 's Day , a spring break ( usually a week in April ) and sometimes a winter break ( a week in February or March ) .
Two or three days per year are sometimes devoted to professional development for teachers and students have the day off .
Most colleges and universities divide the school year into two semesters .
The fall semester often begins the day after Labor Day in early September and runs until mid - December .
The spring semester typically starts in the middle or end of January and runs until May. Winter and summer classes might be offered in January and May – August .
Major federal , state , and local holidays are often observed , including the day after and usually before Thanksgiving .
Spring break is usually a week in March or early April , and in elementary and secondary school and college party culture traditionally involves a warm - weather trip .
Unscheduled weather - related cancellations and emergency cancellations can also affect school calendars .
When taking summer school or summer camp schedules into account , the Independence Day holiday on July4 is usually a scheduled holiday observance for which the summer program closes .
GOVERNMENT SECTOR HOLIDAYS :
FEDERAL , STATE , AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT Section::::Government sector holidays :
federal , state , and local government .
The federal government sector labor force consisted of about 2,729,000 ( as of 2014 ) of the total labor force of 150,539,900 , which is about 2 % of the total labor force or about 1 % of the total population .
In addition , state and local governments consist of another 19,134,000 bringing the total government sector employees to about 15 % of the total labor force .
This sector of the population is entitled to paid time off designated as federal holidays by Congress in Title V of the United States Code ( ) .
Both federal and state government employees generally observe the same federal holidays .
FEDERALLY REGULATED AGENCIES : BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS Section::::Federally regulated agencies : banks and financial institutions .
US banks generally observe the federal holidays because of their reliance on the U.S. Federal Reserve for certain activities such as wire transfers and ACH transactions .
For example , JP Morgan Chase observes all federal holidays except Columbus Day , while U.S. Bank observes all of them .
The New York Stock Exchange also closely follows the federal holidays except for Columbus Day .
However , the agency also has extra holidays on the day before Independence Day and Good Friday .
LEGAL HOLIDAYS
BY STATES AND POLITICAL DIVISIONS OF THE UNITED STATES Section::::Legal holidays by states and political divisions of the United States .
In general , most state governments observe the same holidays that the federal government observes .
