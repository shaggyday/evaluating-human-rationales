LOBSTER SAUCE Lobster sauce is a type of sauce used in American - Chinese and Canadian - Chinese cuisine .
It is also sometimes found in Polynesian - influenced Chinese food .
It is a type of " white sauce " within Chinese cooking , meaning that it is of a mild flavour , and based on meat stock , as opposed to soy sauce .
The sauce itself does not contain any lobster , and may vary in preparation method from place to place or restaurant to restaurant .
However , it will typically contain chicken broth , garlic , ginger , fermented black beans , and eggs , and is thickened with corn - flour .
Some recipes incorporate pork mince and soy sauce .
The colour varies from being pale white , to a yellow , mainly depending on how the eggs are incorporated into the sauce ; if the eggs are added quickly , the sauce acquires a yellow hue .
Lobster sauce in most of New England , where it is a thicker , brown sauce , is the exception .
It may have been named " lobster sauce " due to the fact that it derives from a similar family of sauces used in Cantonese cuisine that were traditionally poured over stir - fried lobster .
It is also used over stir fried shrimp in a dish commonly known as Shrimp with Lobster Sauce ( ) .
