WATER STAGNATION
Water stagnation occurs when water stops flowing .
Stagnant water can be a major environmental hazard .
DANGERS Section::::Dangers .
Malaria and dengue are among the main dangers of stagnant water , which can become a breeding ground for the mosquitoes that transmit these diseases .
Stagnant water can be dangerous for drinking because it provides a better incubator than running water for many kinds of bacteria and parasites .
Stagnant water is often contaminated with human and animal feces , particularly in deserts or other areas of low rain .
Stagnant water may be classified into the following basic , although overlapping , types : * Water body stagnation ( stagnation in swamp , lake , lagoon , river , etc . )
* Surface and ground waters stagnation
* Trapped water stagnation .
The water may be trapped in human artifacts ( discarded cans , plant pots , tires , dug - outs , roofs , etc . ) , as well as in natural containers , such as hollow tree trunks , leaf sheath etc .
To avoid ground and surface water stagnation , drainage of surface and subsoil is advised .
Areas with a shallow water table are more susceptible to ground water stagnation due to the lower availability of natural soil drainage .
LIFE THAT MAY THRIVE IN STAGNANT WATER Section::::Life that may thrive in stagnant water .
Some plants prefer flowing water , while others , such as lotuses , prefer stagnant water .
Various anaerobic bacteria are commonly found in stagnant water .
For this reason , pools of stagnant water have historically been used in processing hemp and some other fiber crops , as well as linden bark used for making bast shoes .
Several weeks of soaking makes bast fibers easily separable due to bacterial and fermentative processes known as retting .
* Denitrifying bacteria * Leptospira * Purple bacteria ( both sulfur and non - sulfur ) FISH
* Lepisosteidae ( gar ) .
* Northern snakehead fish
* Pygmy gourami ...
* Spotted barb
* Walking catfish * Asian swamp
