CASTING
Section::::Casting .
Former umpire Ron Luciano auditioned for Coach Ernie Pantusso , but he failed to get the part because producers " wanted an experienced actor " .
Robert Prosky , who later appeared in the eleventh - season episode " Daddy 's Little Middle - Aged Girl " ( 1992 ) as the character Rebecca Howe 's Navy father , was offered the role of Coach , but he turned down the role .
Therefore , the role was given to Nicholas Colasanto .
According to Colasanto , Coach was nearly " child - like " and more of a surrogate " son " than a surrogate " father " to Sam Malone ( Ted Danson ) , while Sam was more of a " father " to Coach for dependency on Sam 's " moral support " .
Moreover , Coach was beloved by everyone and a good " lovable man " .
According to director and producer James Burrows , the character of Coach was much different from the actor Nick :
Coach was slow , while Nick was sharp .

DEATH
Section::::Death .
Colasanto , who played Coach , had heart disease since the mid-1970s exacerbated by alcoholism .
After years of sobriety , during production his heart disease worsened .
Castmates noticed his weight loss , although the actor kept the severity of his illness a secret .
Shortly after Christmas 1984 , Colasanto was admitted to a local hospital with water in his lungs .
Co - star Ted Danson later said that the veteran actor had difficulty remembering his lines during production that season .
After he was released from the hospital , Colasanto 's doctor recommended that he not return to work .
Although he appeared in the cold opening of the third - season finale ( " Rescue Me " ) , his last full episode was " Cheerio Cheers " ( filmed in late November 1984 ) .
Following Colasanto 's death by heart attack on February 12 , 1985 , the show 's creators decided not to recast Coach 's role , so Coach is written out of the show as deceased without explanation and is replaced since " Birth , Death , Love and Rice " ( episode 70 , 1985 ) by a co - bartender Woody Boyd , portrayed by Woody Harrelson .
Apparently Coach and Woody were " Pen Pals " exchanging pens in the mail .
Sam explains to Woody that Coach died recently .
When Sam visits Diane , she expresses sympathy about Coach 's death .
Coach was referenced occasionally after that , including the time that his niece Joyce appears in only one episode , " The Godfather , Part III " ( 1987 ) .
In the series finale , " One for the Road " , Sam straightens a photograph of Geronimo , used by the late Colasanto as part of his dressing room while he was alive .
The photo was hanging at the bar wall of the stage set " as a remembrance . "
