LIST OF SMALL POLYHEDRA
BY VERTEX COUNT
In geometry , a polyhedron is a solid in three dimensions with flat faces and straight edges .
Every edge has exactly two faces , and every vertex is surrounded by alternating faces and edges .
The smallest polyhedron is the tetrahedron with 4 triangular faces , 6 edges , and 4 vertices .
Named polyhedra primarily come from the families of platonic solids , Archimedean solids , Catalan solids , and Johnson solids , as well as dihedral symmetry families including the pyramids , bipyramids , prisms , antiprisms , and trapezohedrons .

Notes : Polyhedra with different names that are topologically identical are listed together .
Except in the cases of four and five vertices , the lists below are by no means exhaustive of all possible polyhedra with the given number of vertices , but rather just include particularly simple / common / well - known / named examples .
The " Counting Polyhedra " link below gives the exact number of distinct polyhedra with n vertices for small values of n. !
