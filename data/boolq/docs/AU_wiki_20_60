LORAZEPAM Lorazepam , sold under the brand name Ativan among others , is a benzodiazepine medication .
It is used to treat anxiety disorders , trouble sleeping , active seizures including status epilepticus , alcohol withdrawal , and chemotherapy - induced nausea and vomiting .
It is also used during surgery to interfere with memory formation and to sedate those who are being mechanically ventilated .
While it can be used for severe agitation , midazolam is usually preferred .
It is also used , along with other treatments , for acute coronary syndrome due to cocaine use .
It can be given by mouth or as an injection into a muscle or vein .
When given by injection onset of effects is between one and thirty minutes and effects last for up to a day .
Common side effects include weakness , sleepiness , low blood pressure , and a decreased effort to breathe .
When given intravenously the person should be closely monitored .
Among those who are depressed there may be an increased risk of suicide .
With long - term use , larger doses may be required for the same effect .
Physical dependence and psychological dependence may also occur .
If stopped suddenly after long - term use , benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome may occur .
Older people more often develop adverse effects .
In this age group lorazepam is associated with falls and hip fractures .
Due to these concerns , lorazepam use is generally only recommended for up to two to four weeks .
Lorazepam was initially patented in 1963 and went on sale in the United States in 1977 .
It is on the World Health Organization 's List of Essential Medicines , the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system .
It is available as a generic medication .
The wholesale cost in the developing world of a typical dose by mouth is between US$ 0.02 and US$ 0.16 as of 2014 .
In the United States as of 2015 a typical month 's supply is less than US$ 25 .
In the United States in 2011 , 28 million prescriptions for lorazepam were filled making it the second most prescribed benzodiazepine after alprazolam .
MEDICAL USES
ANXIETY Section::::Medical uses .
Section::::Anxiety .
Lorazepam has anxiety - reducing effects and its best - known indication is the short - term management of severe anxiety .
In the US , the FDA advises against use of benzodiazepines such as lorazepam for longer than four weeks .
It is fast acting , and useful in treating fast onset panic anxiety .
Lorazepam can effectively reduce agitation and induce sleep , and the duration of effects from a single dose makes it an appropriate choice for the short - term treatment of insomnia , especially in the presence of severe anxiety or night terrors .
It has a fairly short duration of action .
Withdrawal symptoms , including rebound insomnia and rebound anxiety , may occur after seven days ' use of lorazepam .
SEIZURES Section::::Seizures .
Intravenous diazepam or lorazepam are first - line treatments for convulsive status epilepticus .
Lorazepam is more effective than diazepam and intravenous phenytoin in the treatment of status epilepticus and has a lower risk of continuing seizure that might require additional medication .
However , phenobarbital has a superior success rate compared to lorazepam and other drugs , at least in the elderly .
Lorazepam 's anticonvulsant properties and pharmacokinetic profile , make intravenous use reliable for terminating acute seizures , but induces prolonged sedation .
Oral benzodiazepines , including lorazepam are occasionally used as long - term prophylactic treatment of resistant absence seizures ; because of gradual tolerance to their anti - seizure effects , benzodiazepines such as lorazepam are not considered first - line therapies .
Lorazepam 's anticonvulsant and CNS depressant properties are useful for the treatment and prevention of alcohol withdrawal syndrome .
In this setting , impaired liver function is not a hazard with lorazepam , since lorazepam does not require oxidation , hepatic or otherwise , for its metabolism .
SEDATION Section::::Sedation .
Lorazepam is sometimes used for individuals receiving mechanical ventilation .
However , in critically ill people , propofol has been found to be superior to lorazepam both in effectiveness and overall cost ; as a result , the use of propofol for this indication is now encouraged , whereas the use of lorazepam is discouraged .
Its relative effectiveness in preventing new memory formation , along with its ability to reduce agitation and anxiety , makes lorazepam useful as premedication .
It is given before a general anesthetic to reduce the amount of anesthetic required , or before unpleasant awake procedures , such as in dentistry or endoscopies , to reduce anxiety , to increase compliance , and to induce amnesia for the procedure .
Lorazepam by mouth is given 90 to 120 minutes before procedures , and intravenous lorazepam as late as 10 minutes before procedures .
Lorazepam is sometimes used as an alternative to midazolam in palliative sedation .
In intensive care units lorazepam is sometimes used to produce anxiolysis , hypnosis , and amnesia .
AGITATION
Section::::Agitation .
Lorazepam is sometimes used as an alternative to haloperidol when there is the need for rapid sedation of violent or agitated individuals , but haloperidol plus promethazine is preferred due to better effectiveness and due to lorazepam 's adverse effects on respiratory function .
However , adverse effects such as behavioral disinhibition may make benzodiazepines inappropriate for some acutely psychotic patients .
Acute delirium is sometimes treated with lorazepam , but as it can cause paradoxical effects , it is preferably given together with haloperidol .
Lorazepam is absorbed relatively slowly if given intramuscularly , a common route in restraint situations .
OTHER Section::::Other .
Catatonia with inability to speak is responsive to lorazepam .
Symptoms may recur and treatment for some days may be necessary .
Catatonia due to abrupt or overly rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines , as part of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome , should also respond to lorazepam treatment .
As lorazepam can have paradoxical effects , haloperidol is sometimes given at the same time .
It is sometimes used in chemotherapy in addition to medications used to treat nausea and vomiting , i.e. nausea and vomiting caused or worsened by psychological sensitization to the thought of being sick .
It is also used as adjunct therapy for cyclic vomiting syndrome .
ADVERSE EFFECTS Section::::Adverse effects .
Many beneficial effects of lorazepam ( e.g. , sedative , muscle relaxant , anti - anxiety , and amnesic effects ) may become adverse effects when unwanted .
Adverse effects can include sedation and low blood pressure ; the effects of lorazepam are increased in combination with other CNS depressant drugs .
Other adverse effects include confusion , ataxia , inhibiting the formation of new memories , and hangover effects .
With long - term benzodiazepine use it is unclear whether cognitive impairments fully return to normal after stopping lorazepam use ; cognitive deficits persist for at least six months after withdrawal , but longer than six months may be required for recovery of cognitive function .
Lorazepam appears to have more profound adverse effects on memory than other benzodiazepines ; it impairs both explicit and implicit memory .
In the elderly , falls may occur as a result of benzodiazepines .
Adverse effects are more common in the elderly , and they appear at lower doses than in younger patients .
Benzodiazepines can cause or worsen depression .
Paradoxical effects can also occur , such as worsening of seizures , or paradoxical excitement ; paradoxical excitement is more likely to occur in the elderly , children , those with a history of alcohol abuse , and in people with a history of aggression or anger problems .
Lorazepam 's effects are dose - dependent , meaning the higher the dose , the stronger the effects ( and side effects ) will be .
Using the smallest dose needed to achieve desired effects lessens the risk of adverse effects .
Sedative drugs and sleeping pills , including lorazepam , have been associated with an increased risk of death .
Sedation is the side effect people taking lorazepam most frequently report .
In a group of around 3,500 patients treated for anxiety , the most common side effects complained of from lorazepam were sedation ( 15.9 % ) , dizziness ( 6.9 % ) , weakness ( 4.2 % ) , and unsteadiness ( 3.4 % ) .
Side effects such as sedation and unsteadiness increased with age .
Cognitive impairment , behavioural disinhibition and respiratory depression as well as hypotension may also occur .
* Paradoxical effects : In some cases , paradoxical effects can occur with benzodiazepines , such as increased hostility , aggression , angry outbursts , and psychomotor agitation .
These effects are seen more commonly with lorazepam than with other benzodiazepines .
Paradoxical effects are more likely to occur with higher doses , in patients with pre - existing personality disorders and those with a psychiatric illness .
Frustrating stimuli may trigger such reactions , though the drug may have been prescribed to help the patient cope with such stress and frustration in the first place .
As paradoxical effects appear to be dose - related , they usually subside on dose reduction or on complete withdrawal of lorazepam .
* Suicidality : Benzodiazepines are associated with increased risk of suicide , possibly due to disinhibition .
Higher dosages appear to confer greater risk .
* Amnesic effects : Among benzodiazepines , lorazepam has relatively strong amnesic effects , but patients soon develop tolerance to this with regular use .
To avoid amnesia ( or excess sedation ) being a problem , the initial total daily lorazepam dose should not exceed 2 mg .
This also applies to use for night sedation .
Five participants in a sleep study were prescribed lorazepam 4 mg at night , and the next evening , three subjects unexpectedly volunteered memory gaps for parts of that day , an effect that subsided completely after two to three days ' use .
Amnesic effects can not be estimated from the degree of sedation present , since the two effects are unrelated .
High - dose or prolonged parenterally administered lorazepam is sometimes associated with propylene glycol poisoning .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Section::::Contraindications .
Lorazepam should be avoided in people with : * Allergy or hypersensitivity – Past hypersensitivity or allergy to lorazepam , to any benzodiazepine , or to any of the ingredients in lorazepam tablets or injections
* Severe respiratory failure –
Benzodiazepines , including lorazepam , may depress central nervous system respiratory drive and are contraindicated in severe respiratory failure .
An example would be the inappropriate use to relieve anxiety associated with acute severe asthma .
The anxiolytic effects may also be detrimental to a patient 's willingness and ability to fight for breath .
However , if mechanical ventilation becomes necessary , lorazepam may be used to facilitate deep sedation .
* Acute intoxication – Lorazepam may interact synergistically with the effects of alcohol , narcotics , or other psychoactive substances .
It should , therefore , not be administered to a drunk or intoxicated person .
* Ataxia – This is a neurological clinical sign , consisting of unsteady and clumsy motion of the limbs and torso , due to the failure of gross muscle movement coordination , most evident on standing and walking .
It is the classic way in which acute alcohol intoxication may affect a person .
Benzodiazepines should not be administered to already - ataxic patients .
*
Acute narrow - angle glaucoma
– Lorazepam has pupil - dilating effects , which may further interfere with the drainage of aqueous humor from the anterior chamber of the eye , thus worsening narrow - angle glaucoma .
* Sleep apnea – Sleep apnea may be worsened by lorazepam 's central nervous system depressant effects .
It may further reduce the patient 's ability to protect his or her airway during sleep .
*
Myasthenia gravis –
This condition is characterized by muscle weakness , so a muscle relaxant such as lorazepam may exacerbate symptoms .
* Pregnancy and breastfeeding – Lorazepam belongs to the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) pregnancy category D , which means it is likely to cause harm to the developing baby if taken during the first trimester of pregnancy .
The evidence is inconclusive whether lorazepam if taken early in pregnancy results in reduced intelligence , neurodevelopmental problems , physical malformations in cardiac or facial structure , or other malformations in some newborns .
Lorazepam given to pregnant women antenatally may cause floppy infant syndrome in the neonate , or respiratory depression necessitating ventilation .
Regular lorazepam use during late pregnancy ( the third trimester ) , carries a definite risk of benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in the neonate .
Neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal may include hypotonia , reluctance to suck , apneic spells , cyanosis , and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress .
Symptoms of floppy infant syndrome and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome have been reported to persist from hours to months after birth .
Lorazepam may also inhibit fetal liver bilirubin glucuronidation , leading to neonatal jaundice .
Lorazepam is present in breast milk , so caution must be exercised about breastfeeding .
SPECIFIC GROUPS
* Children and the elderly – The safety and effectiveness of lorazepam is not well determined in children under 18 years of age , but it is used to treat acute seizures .
Dose requirements have to be individualized , especially in the elderly and debilitated patients in whom the risk of oversedation is greater .
Long - term therapy may lead to cognitive deficits , especially in the elderly , which may only be partially reversible .
The elderly metabolize benzodiazepines more slowly than younger people and are more sensitive to the adverse effects of benzodiazepines compared to younger individuals even at similar plasma levels .
Additionally , the elderly tend to take more drugs which may interact or enhance the effects of benzodiazepines .
Benzodiazepines , including lorazepam , have been found to increase the risk of falls and fractures in the elderly .
As a result , dosage recommendations for the elderly are about half of those used in younger individuals and used for no longer than two weeks .
Lorazepam may also be slower to clear in the elderly , leading potentially to accumulation and enhanced effects .
Lorazepam , similar to other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines , causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning .
Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported .
The combination with alcohol increases these impairments .
Partial , but incomplete , tolerance develops to these impairments .
* Liver or kidney failure
– Lorazepam may be safer than most benzodiazepines in patients with impaired liver function .
Like oxazepam , it does not require hepatic oxidation , but only hepatic glucuronidation into lorazepam - glucuronide .
Therefore , impaired liver function is unlikely to result in lorazepam accumulation to an extent causing adverse reactions .
Similarly renal disease has minimal effects on lorazepam levels .
* Surgical premedication – Informed consent given only after receiving lorazepam premedication could have its validity challenged later .
Staff must use chaperones to guard against allegations of abuse during treatment .
Such allegations may arise because of incomplete amnesia , disinhibition , and impaired ability to process cues .
Because of its relative long duration of residual effects ( sedation , ataxia , hypotension , and amnesia ) , lorazepam premedication is best suited for hospital inpatient use .
Patients should not be discharged from the hospital within 24 hours of receiving lorazepam premedication unless accompanied by a caregiver .
They should also not drive , operate machinery , or use alcohol within this period .
* Drug and alcohol dependence – The risk of abuse of lorazepam is increased in dependent patients .
*
Comorbid psychiatric disorders also increase the risk of dependence and paradoxical adverse effects .
TOLERANCE AND DEPENDENCE Section::::Tolerance and dependence .
Dependence typified by a withdrawal syndrome occurs in about one - third of individuals who are treated for longer than four weeks with a benzodiazepine .
Higher doses and longer periods of use increase the risk of developing a benzodiazepine dependence .
Potent benzodiazepines , such as lorazepam , alprazolam , and triazolam , have the highest risk of causing a dependence .
Tolerance to benzodiazepine effects develops with regular use .
This is desirable with amnesic and sedative effects but undesirable with anxiolytic , hypnotic , and anticonvulsant effects .
Patients initially experience drastic relief from anxiety and sleeplessness , but symptoms gradually return , relatively soon in the case of insomnia , but more slowly in the case of anxiety symptoms .
After four to six months of regular benzodiazepine use , evidence of continued efficacy declines .
If regular treatment is continued for longer than four to six months , dose increases may be necessary to maintain effects , but treatment - resistant symptoms may in fact be benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms .
Due to the development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects , benzodiazepines are generally not recommended for long - term use for the management of epilepsy .
Increasing the dose may overcome tolerance , but tolerance may then develop to the higher dose and adverse effects may persist and worsen .
The mechanism of tolerance to benzodiazepines is complex and involves GABA receptor downregulation , alterations to subunit configuration of GABA receptors , uncoupling and internalisation of the benzodiazepine binding site from the GABA receptor complex as well as changes in gene expression .
The likelihood of dependence is relatively high with lorazepam compared to other benzodiazepines .
Lorazepam 's relatively short serum half - life , its confinement mainly to the vascular space , and
its inactive metabolite can result in interdose withdrawal phenomena and next - dose cravings , that may reinforce psychological dependence .
Because of its high potency , the smallest lorazepam tablet strength of 0.5 mg is also a significant dose reduction ( in the UK , the smallest tablet strength is 1.0 mg , which further accentuates this difficulty ) .
To minimise the risk of physical / psychological dependence , lorazepam is best used only short - term , at the smallest effective dose .
If any benzodiazepine has been used long - term , the recommendation is a gradual dose taper over a period of weeks , months or longer , according to dose and duration of use , the degree of dependence and the individual .
Coming off long - term lorazepam use may be more realistically achieved by a gradual switch to an equivalent dose of diazepam and a period of stabilization on this , and only then initiating dose reductions .
The advantage of switching to diazepam is that dose reductions are felt less acutely , because of the longer half - lives ( 20–200 hours ) of diazepam and its active metabolites .
WITHDRAWAL Section::::Withdrawal .
On abrupt or overly rapid discontinuation of lorazepam , anxiety , and signs of physical withdrawal have been observed , similar to those seen on withdrawal from alcohol and barbiturates .
Lorazepam , as with other benzodiazepine drugs , can cause physical dependence , addiction , and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome .
The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken , the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms .
Withdrawal symptoms can , however , occur from standard dosages and also after short - term use .
Benzodiazepine treatment should be discontinued as soon as possible via a slow and gradual dose reduction regimen .
Rebound effects often resemble the condition being treated , but typically at a more intense level and may be difficult to diagnose .
Withdrawal symptoms can range from mild anxiety and insomnia to more severe symptoms such as seizures and psychosis .
The risk and severity of withdrawal are increased with long - term use , use of high doses , abrupt or over - rapid reduction , among other factors .
Short - acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam are more likely to cause a more severe withdrawal syndrome compared to longer - acting benzodiazepines .
Withdrawal symptoms can occur after taking therapeutic doses of Ativan for as little as one week .
Withdrawal symptoms include headaches , anxiety , tension , depression , insomnia , restlessness , confusion , irritability , sweating , dysphoria , dizziness , derealization , depersonalization , numbness / tingling of extremities , hypersensitivity to light , sound , and smell , perceptual distortions , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , appetite loss , hallucinations , delirium , seizures , tremor , stomach cramps , myalgia , agitation , palpitations , tachycardia , panic attacks , short - term memory loss , and hyperthermia .
It takes about 18–36 hours for the benzodiazepine to be removed from the body .
The ease of addiction to lorazepam , ( Ativan brand was particularly cited ) , and its withdrawal were brought to the attention of the British public during the early 1980s in Esther Rantzen 's BBC TV series That 's Life ! , in a feature on the drug over a number of episodes .
INTERACTIONS
Section::::Interactions .
Lorazepam is not usually fatal in overdose , but may cause fatal respiratory depression if taken in overdose with alcohol .
The combination also causes synergistic enhancement of the disinhibitory and amnesic effects of both drugs , with potentially embarrassing or criminal consequences .
Some experts advise that patients should be warned against drinking alcohol while on lorazepam treatment , but such clear warnings are not universal .
Synergistic adverse effects may also occur when lorazepam is administered with other drugs , such as opioids or other hypnotics .
Lorazepam may also interact with rifabutin .
Valproate inhibits the metabolism of lorazepam , whereas carbamazepine , lamotrigine , phenobarbital , phenytoin , and rifampin increase its rate of metabolism .
Some antidepressants , antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital , phenytoin and carbamazepine , sedative antihistamines , opiates , antipsychotics and alcohol , when taken with lorazepam may result in enhanced sedative effects .
OVERDOSE Section::::Overdose .
In cases of a suspected lorazepam overdose , it is important to establish whether the patient is a regular user of lorazepam or other benzodiazepines since regular use causes tolerance to develop .
Also , one must ascertain whether other substances were also ingested .
Signs of overdose range through mental confusion , dysarthria , paradoxical reactions , drowsiness , hypotonia , ataxia , hypotension , hypnotic state , coma , cardiovascular depression , respiratory depression , and death .
Early management of alert patients includes emetics , gastric lavage , and activated charcoal .
Otherwise , management is by observation , including of vital signs , support and , only if necessary , considering the hazards of doing so , giving intravenous flumazenil .
Patients are ideally nursed in a kind , frustration - free environment , since , when given or taken in high doses , benzodiazepines are more likely to cause paradoxical reactions .
If shown sympathy , even quite crudely feigned , patients may respond solicitously , but they may respond with disproportionate aggression to frustrating cues .
Opportunistic counseling has limited value here , as the patient is unlikely to recall this later , owing to drug - induced anterograde amnesia .
DETECTION IN BODY FLUIDS Section::::Detection in body fluids .
Lorazepam may be quantitated in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients , provide evidence of an impaired driving arrest or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation .
Blood or plasma concentrations are usually in a range of 10–300 μg / l in persons either receiving the drug therapeutically or in those arrested for impaired driving .
Approximately 300–1000 μg / l is found in victims of acute overdosage .
PHARMACOLOGY Section::::Pharmacology .
Lorazepam has anxiolytic , sedative , hypnotic , amnesic , anticonvulsant , and muscle relaxant properties .
It is a high - potency and an intermediate - acting benzodiazepine , and its uniqueness , advantages , and disadvantages are largely explained by its pharmacokinetic properties ( poor water and lipid solubility , high protein binding and anoxidative metabolism to a pharmacologically inactive glucuronide form ) and by its high relative potency ( lorazepam 1 mg is equal in effect to diazepam 10 mg ) .
The biological half - life of lorazepam is 10–20 hours .
PHARMACOKINETICS Section::::Pharmacokinetics .
Lorazepam is highly protein bound and is extensively metabolized into pharmacologically inactive metabolites .
Due to its poor lipid solubility , lorazepam is absorbed relatively slowly by mouth and is unsuitable for rectal administration .
However , its poor lipid solubility and high degree of protein binding ( 85–90 % ) mean its volume of distribution is mainly the vascular compartment , causing relatively prolonged peak effects .
This contrasts with the highly lipid - soluble diazepam , which , although rapidly absorbed orally or rectally , soon redistributes from the serum to other parts of the body , in particular , body fat .
This explains why one lorazepam dose , despite its shorter serum half - life , has more prolonged peak effects than an equivalent diazepam dose .
Lorazepam is rapidly conjugated at its 3-hydroxy group into lorazepam glucuronide which is then excreted in the urine .
Lorazepam glucuronide has no demonstrable CNS activity in animals .
The plasma levels of lorazepam are proportional to the dose given .
There is no evidence of accumulation of lorazepam on administration up to six months .
On regular administration , diazepam will accumulate , since it has a longer half - life and active metabolites , these metabolites also have long half - lives .
Clinical example
: Diazepam has long been a drug of choice for status epilepticus ; its high lipid solubility means it gets absorbed with equal speed whether given orally , or rectally ( nonintravenous routes are convenient in outside hospital settings ) , but diazepam 's high lipid solubility also means it does not remain in the vascular space , but soon redistributes into other body tissues .
So , it may be necessary to repeat diazepam doses to maintain peak anticonvulsant effects , resulting in excess body accumulation .
Lorazepam is a different case ; its low lipid solubility makes it relatively slowly absorbed by any route other than intravenously , but once injected , it will not get significantly redistributed beyond the vascular space .
Therefore , lorazepam 's anticonvulsant effects are more durable , thus reducing the need for repeated doses .
If a patient is known to usually stop convulsing after only one or two diazepam doses , it may be preferable because sedative after effects will be less than if a single dose of lorazepam is given ( diazepam anticonvulsant / sedative effects wear off after 15–30 minutes , but lorazepam effects last 12–24 hours ) .
The prolonged sedation from lorazepam may , however , be an acceptable trade - off for its reliable duration of effects , particularly if the patient needs to be transferred to another facility .
Although lorazepam is not necessarily better than diazepam at initially terminating seizures , lorazepam is , nevertheless , replacing diazepam as the intravenous agent of choice in status epilepticus .
Lorazepam serum levels are proportional to the dose administered .
Giving 2 mg oral lorazepam will result in a peak total serum level of around 20 ng / ml around two hours later , half of which is lorazepam , half its inactive metabolite , lorazepam - glucuronide .
A similar lorazepam dose given intravenously will result in an earlier and higher peak serum level , with a higher relative proportion of unmetabolised ( active ) lorazepam .
On regular administration , maximum serum levels are attained after three days .
Longer - term use , up to six months , does not result in further accumulation .
On discontinuation , lorazepam serum levels become negligible after three days and undetectable after about a week .
Lorazepam is metabolized in the liver by conjugation into inactive lorazepam - glucuronide .
This metabolism does not involve hepatic oxidation , so is relatively unaffected by reduced liver function .
Lorazepam - glucuronide is more water - soluble than its precursor , so gets more widely distributed in the body , leading to a longer half - life than lorazepam .
Lorazepam - glucuronide is eventually excreted by the kidneys , and , because of its tissue accumulation , it remains detectable , particularly in the urine , for substantially longer than lorazepam .
PHARMACODYNAMICS Section::::Pharmacodynamics .
Relative to other benzodiazepines , lorazepam is thought to have high affinity for GABA receptors , which may also explain its marked amnesic effects .
Its main pharmacological effects are the enhancement of the effects of the neurotransmitter GABA at the GABA receptor .
Benzodiazepines , such as lorazepam , enhance the effects of GABA at the GABA receptor via increasing the frequency of opening of the chloride ion channel on the GABA receptors ; which results in the therapeutic actions of benzodiazepines .
They , however , do not on their own enhance the GABA receptors , but require the neurotransmitter GABA to be present .
Thus , the effect of benzodiazepines is to enhance the effects of the neurotransmitter GABA .
The magnitude and duration of lorazepam effects are dose - related , meaning larger doses have stronger and longer - lasting effects , because the brain has spare benzodiazepine drug receptor capacity , with single , clinical doses leading only to an occupancy of some 3 % of the available receptors .
The anticonvulsant properties of lorazepam and other benzodiazepines may be , in part or entirely , due to binding to voltage - dependent sodium channels rather than benzodiazepine receptors .
Sustained repetitive firing seems to get limited , by the benzodiazepine effect of slowing recovery of sodium channels from inactivation in mouse spinal cord cell cultures .
PHYSICAL PROPERTIES AND FORMULATIONS Section::::Physical properties and formulations .
Pure lorazepam is an almost white powder that is nearly insoluble in water and oil .
In medicinal form , it is mainly available as tablets and a solution for injection , but , in some locations , it is also available as a skin patch , an oral solution , and a sublingual tablet .
Lorazepam tablets and syrups are administered by mouth only .
Lorazepam tablets of the Ativan brand also contain lactose , microcrystalline cellulose , polacrilin , magnesium stearate , and coloring agents ( indigo carmine in blue tablets and tartrazine in yellow tablets ) .
Lorazepam for injection formulated with polyethylene glycol 400 in propylene glycol with 2.0 % benzyl alcohol as preservative .
Lorazepam injectable solution is administered either by deep intramuscular injection or by intravenous injection .
The injectable solution comes in 1 ml ampoules containing 2 or 4 mg of lorazepam .
The solvents used are polyethylene glycol 400 and propylene glycol .
As a preservative , the injectable solution contains benzyl alcohol .
Toxicity from propylene glycol has been reported in the case of a patient receiving a continuous lorazepam infusion .
Intravenous injections should be given slowly and patients closely monitored for side effects , such as respiratory depression , hypotension , or loss of airway control .
Peak effects roughly coincide with peak serum levels , which occur 10 minutes after intravenous injection , up to 60 minutes after intramuscular injection , and 90 to 120 minutes after oral administration , but initial effects will be noted before this .
A clinically relevant lorazepam dose will normally be effective for six to 12 hours , making it unsuitable for regular once - daily administration , so it is usually prescribed as two to four daily doses when taken regularly , but this may be extended to five or six , especially in the case of elderly patients who could not handle large doses at once .
Topical formulations of lorazepam , while used as treatment for nausea especially in patients in hospice , ought not be used in this form and for this purpose as they have not been proven effective .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Historically , lorazepam is one of the " classical " benzodiazepines .
Others include diazepam , clonazepam , oxazepam , nitrazepam , flurazepam , bromazepam , and clorazepate .
Lorazepam was first introduced by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals in 1977 under the brand names Ativan and Temesta .
The drug was developed by President of Research , D.J. Richards .
Wyeth 's original patent on lorazepam is expired in the United States , but the drug continues to be commercially viable .
SOCIETY AND CULTURE RECREATIONAL USE Section::::Society and culture .
Section::::Recreational use .
Lorazepam is also used for other purposes , such as recreational use , wherein the drug is taken to achieve a high , or when the drug is continued long - term against medical advice .
In addition to recreational use , flunitrazepam , another member of the benzodiazepine family , may be taken to facilitate criminal activity .
The anterograde amnesia and sedative - hypnotic effects of benzodiazepines such as lorazepam are sometimes used by predators on unwitting victims as date rape drugs , or for the purpose of robbery .
A large - scale , nationwide , U.S. government study of
pharmaceutical - related emergency department ( ED ) visits by SAMHSA found sedative - hypnotics are the pharmaceuticals most frequently used outside of their prescribed medical purpose in the United States , with 35 % of drug - related emergency department visits involving sedative - hypnotics .
In this category , benzodiazepines are most commonly used .
Males and females use benzodiazepines for nonmedical purposes equally .
Of drugs used in attempted suicide , benzodiazepines are the most commonly used pharmaceutical drugs , with 26 % of attempted suicides involving them .
Lorazepam was the third - most - common benzodiazepine used outside of prescription in these ER visit statistics .
LEGAL STATUS Section::::Legal status .
Lorazepam is a Schedule IV drug under the Controlled Substances Act in the U.S. and internationally under the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances .
It is a Schedule IV drug under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act in Canada .
In the United Kingdom , it is a Class C , Schedule 4 Controlled Drug under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 .
PRICING
Section::::Pricing .
In 2000 , the U.S. drug company Mylan agreed to pay $ 147 million to settle accusations by the FTC that they had raised the price of generic lorazepam by 2600 % and generic clorazepate by 3200 % in 1998 after having obtained exclusive licensing agreements for certain ingredients .
