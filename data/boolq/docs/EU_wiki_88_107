MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL WILD CARD
In Major League Baseball ( MLB ) , the wild card teams are the two teams in each of the two leagues ( American and National ) that have qualified for the postseason despite failing to win their division .
Both teams in each league possess the two best winning percentages in their respective league after the three division winners .
The wild card was first instituted in MLB in 1994 , with one wild - card team per league advancing to the Division Series in the postseason to face a division winner .
In 2012 , the system was modified to add a second wild - card team per league and put each league 's wild - card teams against each other in a play - in game — the MLB Wild Card Game — the winner of which would then advance to the Division Series and play the team with the best record .
This system ensures that the team with the second - best record in each league , after the three division winners and the team with the first - best record in the league that is a non - division winner , will also get a postseason berth , even if it is n't a division champion .
ONE WILD CARD PER LEAGUE ( 1994–2011 ) Section::::One wild card per league ( 1994–2011 ) .
From 1969 through 1993 , division leaders in each league advanced to the League Championship Series , with the winners of each LCS meeting in the World Series .
However , an expanding number of teams over the years made making the playoffs increasingly difficult .
The new system was instituted in 1994 ( but first used in 1995 because a players strike canceled the 1994 playoffs )
when Major League Baseball expanded from two to three divisions per league .
In the new three - division leagues , each league had four teams in the playoffs .
In addition to the three division winners , a wild - card team made the playoffs as the fourth seed .
This was the team with the most wins amongst non - division winners .
The wild - card matchup was played in the first round between the League leader in wins and the wild - card team , unless both teams were in the same division , which resulted in the wild card facing the second - best division winner in the league .
HISTORIC ANOMALIES Section::::Historic anomalies .
A " wild card " rule was used in the 1981 season after a players ' strike wiped out the " middle third " of the season .
The owners decided that the winners ( in each division ) of either " half " of the abbreviated season would make playoffs , with the caveat that if the same team won both halves then the team from the division with the second - best record from the second half would enter the playoffs as a wild card .
However , the wild - card rule was not actually used since all four divisions had different first half and second - half winners .
As a result of the hastily contrived format , the Cincinnati Reds finished the regular season with the best record in all of baseball ( 66 - 42 .611 ) but failed to qualify for the playoffs because they finished 0.5 game behind the Dodgers in the first half and 1.5 games behind the Astros in the second half .
The Astros finished 8 games back in the first half and the Dodgers 6 back in the second .
TWO
WILD CARDS PER LEAGUE ( 2012–PRESENT ) Section::::Two wild cards per league ( 2012–present ) .
On November 17 , 2011 , MLB announced that it would be adding two wild - card teams to the postseason .
The two wild - card teams in each league face each other in a one - game playoff .
The winner of this game advances to meet the top seed in the Division Series .
The revised playoff system began with the 2012 season .
