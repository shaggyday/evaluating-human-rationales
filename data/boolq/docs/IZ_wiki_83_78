LIST OF SONGS IN GUITAR HERO LIVE
Guitar Hero Live is a 2015 music video game that 's developed by FreeStyleGames and published by Activision .
It is the first title in the Guitar Hero series since it went on hiatus after 2011 , and the first game in the series available for 8th generation video game consoles ( PlayStation 4 , Wii U , and Xbox One ) .
The game was released worldwide on 20 October 2015 for these systems as well as the PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 , and iOS devices including the Apple TV .
The title is considered a reboot of the series ; instead of using a five - button guitar - shaped game controller , the game shipped with a six - button controller , arranged in two rows of three aimed to provide more realistic fingering positions than the five - button controller .
The game includes 42 songs on the game 's disc , presented in sets using full motion video taken from the first - person perspective of the lead guitarist as the background visuals to create an immersive experience .
Guitar Hero Live does not use traditional downloadable content to expand the game and is not backward compatible with previous songs from Guitar Hero games .
Instead , the game includes the online Guitar Hero TV ( GHTV ) mode modeled after music video channels that players can jump in or out of at any time , playing through ongoing songs in a curated fashion .
GHTV , through in - game rewards and microtransactions , supports the ability to play any song in the library , perform Premium shows where the newest tracks to GHTV will be found , or even unlock all features for a 24-hour period as part of a Party Pass .
Two hundred songs were available at the release of the game , with more added over time , averaging about six brand new songs each week .
FreeStyleGames selected on - disc songs from a wider variety of music genres beyond rock music as to provide challenging guitar tracks for players , while their approach to licensing of songs for GHTV enabled them to attract more musical acts to offer their music .
Game reviewers found the on - disc soundtrack to be weak as it focused too much on more recent musical acts , while praising the wider variety across a larger time period that GHTV offered .

GHTV Section::::GHTV .
Forgoing the downloadable content model used in previous Guitar Hero games , Guitar Hero Live adds songs to the game via Guitar Hero TV ( GHTV ) , an online game mode offered free of charge in Guitar Hero Live .
Instead of playing the immersive first - person view that the main career mode presents , songs on GHTV are played over the music video or footage of the band playing at a concert .
Songs on GHTV are normally offered in a curated rotation , similar to a music video channel , allowing the player to drop in and out , but the player can use collected in - game rewards or use microtransactions to play any available song outside of this rotation .
FreeStyleGames found that this approach , in contrast to the traditional downloadable content model , made it easier to secure licensing rights with artists to use their songs , as well as a throwback to the heyday of music video channels like MTV .

Reviewers considered the on - disc soundtrack for Guitar Hero Live weak .
Griffin McElroy of Polygon found it the " biggest disappointment " of the game given the setlist had mostly songs from 2000 or later , forgoing classic rock songs .
GameSpots Scott Buttersworth stated that many of the on - disc selections are pop songs that " just are n't cut out for Guitar Hero gameplay " , as they feature the same repeating guitar riff over and over .
Ben Griffin of GamesRadar was more favorable of the on - disc set list , finding that the tracks represented " the music landscape as it is rather than as it was " .
Chris Carter of Destructoid also appreciated the soundtrack , calling it a " good spread " of songs that can appeal to everyone .
The GHTV mode earned mixed opinions , with most reviewers praising the concept .
The presentation of the channels was highlighted as hearkening to the heyday of MTV , and praised for providing players with the ability to explore new music .
The selection of songs for GHTV was considered very diverse , and some reviewers found the GHTV songlist to be better varied than the on - disc list , providing songs from " six - string classic " bands that work well for games like Guitar Hero .
Criticism was raised on the use of microtransactions and premium shows , disallowing players to play specific tracks at any time without cost .
