GAMEPLAY
Section::::Gameplay .
State of Decay contains elements of third person combat and simulation ( building base and outposts ) .
The player is in charge of a small group of survivors and can either follow the storyline or perform tasks that ensure their community 's survival .
The game world is 16 square kilometers , 8 square kilometers of which is playable .
The player can choose from several locations to build a base , then reinforce and improve it with various facilities like watch towers , gardens , sleeping quarters , kitchens , workshops , medical bays , etc .
to help keep survivors safe and healthy .
Part of the game is balancing the use of resources : food , medicine , ammo , and construction materials .
They can be obtained by scavenging , trading with NPCs , only food can be grown at the base .
The player can interact with survivors outside of their group : trading with them , helping them or recruiting them .
The game features two relationship meters , the first determines if a survivor can be recruited , and the second dictates if they can be controlled .
Only one survivor can be controlled at a time , though the player can ask an AI - controlled survivor to accompany them , and in certain missions , one or more AI - controlled survivors will accompany the player .
The Storyline mode features around 150 characters , with varying facial features and clothing .
Each character has a fixed set of " traits " which give them advantages or flaws ( such as tire out more easily , or can improve a certain skill faster ) .
Except for the story - related characters , most characters can be assigned to survivor groups and be recruited .
Each character also has an " attitude " parameter , affected by game events ( a near death experience , death of another character , or having accomplished a difficult task ) .
These attitudes can affect their behaviors , sometimes requiring player intervention .
Zombies are the main threat in State of Decay .
They respawn infinitely ( unless the player establishes an outpost , which prevents spawns ) , are attracted to noise , and are capable of sprinting nearly as fast as the characters .
The player can choose to confront them directly , use stealth to sneak past them , or divert them using items like firecrackers .
In addition , there are special types of zombies , such as the animal - like " Ferals " or the tank - like " Juggernauts " that are quite dangerous in one - on - one confrontations .
The game does n't have human enemies , only zombies .
The game features over 100 different weapons , including around 30 melee weapons that can be found while scavenging ( they can not be crafted ) .
Melee weapon and firearms are further divided into sub - categories , which have different attack animations and effects .
All weapons have a durability rating , and will break when used excessively without repairs .
Besides weapons , the player can find or create various consumables to improve their chances of survival , such as painkillers and pipe bombs .
Besides walking , the player has access to several types of cars , each with its own characteristics like maneuverability and speed .
All vehicles can be damaged and destroyed when running over zombies or hitting obstacles , although they can be repaired at the home base .
PLOT Section::::Plot .
The story takes place in the fictional Trumbull Valley .
The first playable character is Marcus Campbell , a store clerk .
After returning from a fishing trip with his friend and a Trumbull local , Ed Jones , he finds that the world has degenerated into a zombie apocalypse .
The two are soon joined by Maya Torres , a soldier .
They acquire a walkie - talkie and make contact with Lily Ritter .
Following her direction , they make their way to a church called the Church of the Ascension , where Lily and several other survivors have made a home base .
With Ed wounded , the trio accept Lily 's offer to let them stay .
As the game progresses , the survivors become aware of the United States Army 's presence in Trumbull Valley , led by Sergeant Erik Tan and Captain Diane Montressor .
They soon learn that the army 's top priority is not to evacuate the survivors , but to contain and try to find the cause of the outbreak .
The players also find the local civic leader , Judge Lawton , has barricaded the courthouse with the local law enforcement .
She places citizens in her care under martial laws , planning to rebuild after the zombie incursion blows over .
Finally , the players are also introduced to The Wilkersons , a group of hillbilly gun - runners who are using the apocalypse to profit and exploit other survivors .
Near the end , the courthouse falls to a zombie attack and Judge Lawton dies .
Captain Montressor is evacuated , leaving behind Sergeant Tan and his men .
The player , along with Tan , discovers numerous dead bodies dumped at the reservoir , explaining the cause of the , " Black Fever , " that has plagued numerous survivors in Trumbull Valley .
With their only water source contaminated and long term survival no longer an option , they plan to leave the valley .
After raiding a zombie - infested warehouse to get explosives , the group head to the only road leading out of the valley , now blocked with a massive concrete wall .
While Tan sets up the explosives , the player holds off incoming zombies .
Tan realizes the detonator has malfunctioned , and the explosives can not be detonated from a safe distance .
He volunteers to manually detonate it , claiming he 's already infected .
He sacrifices himself and sets off the explosives , which destroys the wall .
As the smoke clears , the player sees the other side is also filled with destroyed cars and bodies , implying the apocalypse has already spread outside Trumbull Valley .
The survivors leave the valley and the game ends .
