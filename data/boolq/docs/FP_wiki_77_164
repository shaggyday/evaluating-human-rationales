COUNTRIES OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
The United Kingdom ( UK ) comprises four countries : England , Scotland and Wales ( which collectively make up Great Britain ) and Northern Ireland ( which is variously described as a country , province or region ) .
Within the United Kingdom , a unitary sovereign state , Northern Ireland , Scotland and Wales have gained a degree of autonomy through the process of devolution .
The UK Parliament and British Government deal with all reserved matters for Northern Ireland , Scotland and Wales , but not in general matters that have been devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly , Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales .
Additionally , devolution in Northern Ireland is conditional on co - operation between the Northern Ireland Executive and the Government of Ireland ( see North / South Ministerial Council ) and the British Government consults with the Government of Ireland to reach agreement on some non - devolved matters for Northern Ireland ( see British – Irish Intergovernmental Conference ) .
England , comprising the majority of the population and area of the United Kingdom , remains fully the responsibility of the UK Parliament centralised in London .
England , Northern Ireland , Scotland and Wales are not themselves listed in the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) list of countries .
However the ISO list of the subdivisions of the UK , compiled by British Standards and the UK 's Office for National Statistics , uses " country " to describe England , Scotland and Wales .
Northern Ireland , in contrast , is described as a " province " in the same lists .
Each has separate national governing bodies for sports and compete separately in many international sporting competitions , including the Commonwealth Games .
Northern Ireland also forms joint All - Island sporting bodies with the Republic of Ireland for most sports , including rugby union .
The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are dependencies of the Crown and are not part of the UK .
Similarly , the British overseas territories , remnants of the British Empire , are not part of the UK .
Historically , from 1801 , following the Acts of Union , until 1921 the whole island of Ireland was a country within the UK .
Ireland was split into two separate jurisdictions in 1921 : Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland .
Southern Ireland left the United Kingdom under the Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922 .

TERMINOLOGY Section::::Terminology .
Various terms have been used to describe England , Northern Ireland , Scotland and Wales .
ACTS OF PARLIAMENT
*
The Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542 annexed the legal system of Wales to England to create the single entity commonly known for centuries simply as England , but later officially renamed England and Wales .
Wales was described ( in varying combinations ) as the " country " , " principality " , and " dominion " of Wales .
Outside Wales , England was not given a specific name or term .
The Laws in Wales Acts have subsequently been repealed .
*
The Acts of Union 1707 refer to both England and Scotland as a " part " of a united kingdom of Great Britain
*
The Acts of Union 1800 use " part " in the same way to refer to England and Scotland .
However , they use the word " country " to describe Great Britain and Ireland respectively , when describing trade between them
* The Government of Ireland Act 1920 described Great Britain , Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland as " countries " in provisions relating to taxation .
*
The Northern Ireland Act 1998 , which repealed the Government of Ireland Act 1920 , does not use any term to describe Northern Ireland .
CURRENT LEGAL TERMINOLOGY Section::::Acts of Parliament .
Section::::Current legal terminology .
The Interpretation Act 1978 provides statutory definitions of the terms " England " , " Wales " and the " United Kingdom " , but neither that Act nor any other current statute defines " Scotland " or " Northern Ireland " .
Use of the first three terms in other legislation is interpreted following the definitions in the 1978 Act .
The definitions in the 1978 Act are listed below : * " England " means , " subject to any alteration of boundaries under Part IV of the Local Government Act 1972 , the area consisting of the counties established by section 1 of that Act , Greater London and the Isles of Scilly .
"
This definition applies from 1 April 1974 .
*
" United Kingdom " means " Great Britain and Northern Ireland .
"
This definition applies from 12 April 1927 .
* " Wales " means the combined area of 13 historic counties , including Monmouthshire , re - formulated into 8 new counties under section 20 of the Local Government Act 1972 , as originally enacted , but subject to any alteration made under section 73 of that Act ( consequential alteration of boundary following alteration of watercourse ) .
In 1996 these 8 new counties were redistributed into the current 22 unitary authorities .
In the Scotland Act 1998 there is no delineation of Scotland , with the definition in section 126 simply providing that Scotland includes " so much of the internal waters and territorial sea of the United Kingdom as are adjacent to Scotland " .
The Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 refers to England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland as " parts " of the United Kingdom in the following clause : " Each constituency shall be wholly in one of the four parts of the United Kingdom ( England , Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland ) . "
OTHER OFFICIAL USAGE Section::::Other official usage .
The Royal Fine Art Commission 's 1847 report on decorating the Palace of Westminster referred to " the nationality of the component parts of the United Kingdom " being represented by their four respective patron saints .
CURRENT Section::::Current .
" Regions " :
For purposes of NUTS 1 collection of statistical data in a format that is compatible with similar data that is collected elsewhere in the European Union , the United Kingdom has been divided into twelve regions of approximately equal size .
Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland are regions in their own right while England has been divided into nine regions .
The official term rest of the UK ( RUK or rUK ) is used in Scotland , for example in export statistics and in legislating for student funding .
This term is also used in the context of potential Scottish independence to mean the UK without Scotland .
The alternative term Home Nations is sometimes used in sporting contexts and may include all of the island of Ireland .
IDENTITY AND NATIONALITY Section::::Identity and nationality .
According to the British Social Attitudes Survey , there are broadly two interpretations of British identity , with ethnic and civic dimensions : Of the two perspectives of British identity , the civic definition has become the dominant idea and in this capacity , Britishness is sometimes considered an institutional or overarching state identity .
This has been used to explain why first- , second- and third - generation immigrants are more likely to describe themselves as British , rather than English , Northern Irish , Scottish or Welsh , because it is an " institutional , inclusive " identity , that can be acquired through naturalisation and British nationality law ; the vast majority of people in the United Kingdom who are from an ethnic minority feel British .
However , this attitude is more common in England than in Scotland or Wales ; " white English people perceived themselves as English first and as British second , and most people from ethnic minority backgrounds perceived themselves as British , but none identified as English , a label they associated exclusively with white people " .
Contrariwise , in Scotland and Wales " there was a much stronger identification with each country than with Britain . "
Studies and surveys have reported that the majority of the Scots and Welsh see themselves as both Scottish / Welsh and British though with some differences in emphasis .
The Commission for Racial Equality found that with respect to notions of nationality in Britain , " the most basic , objective and uncontroversial conception of the British people is one that includes the English , the Scots and the Welsh " .
However , " English participants tended to think of themselves as indistinguishably English or British , while both Scottish and Welsh participants identified themselves much more readily as Scottish or Welsh than as British " .
Some people opted " to combine both identities " as " they felt Scottish or Welsh , but held a British passport and were therefore British " , whereas others saw themselves as exclusively Scottish or exclusively Welsh and " felt quite divorced from the British , whom they saw as the English " .
Commentators have described this latter phenomenon as " nationalism " , a rejection of British identity because some Scots and Welsh interpret it as " cultural imperialism imposed " upon the United Kingdom by " English ruling elites " , or else a response to a historical misappropriation of equating the word " English " with " British " , which has " brought about a desire among Scots , Welsh and Irish to learn more about their heritage and distinguish themselves from the broader British identity " .
The propensity for nationalistic feeling varies greatly across the UK , and can rise and fall over time .
The state - funded Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey , part of a joint project between the University of Ulster and Queen 's University Belfast , has addressed the issue of identity in since it started polling in 1998 .
It reported that 37 % of people identified as British , whilst 29 % identified as Irish and 24 % identified as Northern Irish .
3 % opted to identify themselves as Ulster , whereas 7 % stated ' other ' .
Of the two main religious groups , 68 % of Protestants identified as British as did 6 % of Catholics ; 60 % of Catholics identified as Irish as did 3 % of Protestants .
21 % of Protestants and 26 % of Catholics identified as Northern Irish .
For Northern Ireland , however , the results of the Life & Times Survey are not the whole story .
The poll asks for a single preference , whereas many people easily identify as any combination of British and Irish , or British , Northern Irish and Irish , or Irish and Northern Irish .
The 2014 Life & Times Survey addressed this to an extent by choosing two of the options from the identity question : British and Irish .
It found that , while 28 % of respondents stated they felt " British not Irish " and 26 % felt " Irish not British " , 39 % of respondents felt some combination of both identities .
Six percent chose ' other description ' .
The identity question is confounded further by identity with politics and religion , and particularly by a stance on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland .
Again in 2014 , the Life & Times Survey asked what respondents felt should be the " long term future for Northern Ireland " .
66 % of respondents felt the future should be as a part of the UK , with or without devolved government .
17 % felt that Northern Ireland should unify with the Republic of Ireland .
50 % of specifically Roman Catholics considered that the long - term future should be as part of the UK , with 32 % opting for separation .
87 % of respondents identifying as any Protestant denomination opted for remaining part of the UK , with only 4 % opting for separation .
Of those respondents who declared no religion , 62 % opted for remaining part of the UK , with 9 % opting for separation .
Following devolution and the significant broadening of autonomous governance throughout the UK in the late 1990s , debate has taken place across the United Kingdom on the relative value of full independence , an option that was rejected by the Scottish people in the Scottish independence referendum , 2014 .
Cornwall is administered as a county of England , but the Cornish people are a recognised national minority , included under the terms of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities in 2014 .
COMPETITIONS Section::::Competitions .
Each of England , Northern Ireland , Scotland and Wales has separate national governing bodies for sports and competes separately in many international sporting competitions .
Each country of the United Kingdom has a national football team , and competes as a separate national team in the various disciplines in the Commonwealth Games .
At the Olympic Games , the United Kingdom is represented by the Great Britain and Northern Ireland team , although athletes from Northern Ireland can choose to join the Republic of Ireland 's Olympic team .
In addition to Northern Ireland having its own national governing bodies for some sports such as Association football and Netball , for others , such as rugby union and cricket , Northern Ireland participates with the Republic of Ireland in a joint All - Ireland team .
England and Wales field a joint cricket team .
The United Kingdom participates in the Eurovision Song Contest as a single entity , though there have been calls for separate and Scottish and Welsh entrants .
In 2018 , Wales participated alone in the spin - off " Choir of the Year " , placing second .
