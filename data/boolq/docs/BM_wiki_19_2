BREAST MILK Breast milk is the milk produced by the breasts ( or mammary glands ) of a human female to feed a child .
Milk is the primary source of nutrition for newborns before they are able to eat and digest other foods ; older infants and toddlers may continue to be breastfed , in combination with other foods from six months of age when solid foods should be introduced .
METHODS Section::::Methods .
The baby nursing from its own mother is the most common way of obtaining breast milk , but the milk can be pumped and then fed by baby bottle , cup and/or spoon , supplementation drip system , or nasogastric tube .
In preterm children who do not have the ability to suck during their early days of life , avoiding bottles and tubes , and use of cups to feed expressed milk and other supplements is reported to result in better breastfeeding extent and duration subsequently .
Breast milk can be supplied by a woman other than the baby 's mother , either via donated pumped milk ( generally from a milk bank or via informal milk donation ) , or when a woman nurses a child other than her own at her breast , a practice known as wetnursing .
The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life , with solids gradually being introduced around this age when signs of readiness are shown .
Supplemented breastfeeding is recommended until at least age two and then for as long as the mother and child wish .
BENEFITS Section::::Benefits .
Breastfeeding offers health benefits to mother and child even after infancy .
These benefits include a 73 % decreased risk of sudden infant death syndrome , increased intelligence , decreased likelihood of contracting middle ear infections , cold and flu resistance , a tiny decrease in the risk of childhood leukemia , lower risk of childhood onset diabetes , decreased risk of asthma and eczema , decreased dental problems , decreased risk of obesity later in life , and a decreased risk of developing psychological disorders , including in adopted children .
In addition , feeding an infant breast milk is associated with lower insulin levels and higher leptin levels compared feeding an infant via powdered - formula .
Breastfeeding also provides health benefits for the mother .
It assists the uterus in returning to its pre - pregnancy size and reduces post - partum bleeding , as well as assisting the mother in returning to her pre - pregnancy weight .
Breastfeeding also reduces the risk of breast cancer later in life .
Lactation protects both mother and infant from both types of diabetes .
Lactation may protect the infant from specifically developing Type 2 diabetes because studies have shown that bioactive ingredients in human breast milk could prevent excess weight gain during childhood via contributing to a feeling of energy and satiety .
A lower risk of child - onset diabetes may more applicable to infants who were born from diabetic mothers .
The reason is because while breastfeeding for at least the first 6 months of life minimizes the risk of Type 1 diabetes from occurring in the infant , inadequate breastfeeding in an infant prenatally exposed to diabetes was associated with a higher risk of the child developing diabetes later on .
However , it can be argued that human breastfeeding may contribute to protective effects against the development of Type 1 diabetes due to the fact that the alternative of bottle - feeding may expose infants to unhygienic feeding conditions .
Though it now is almost universally prescribed , in some countries in the 1950s the practice of breastfeeding went through a period where it was out of vogue and the use of infant formula was considered superior to breast milk .
However , it is now universally recognized that there is no commercial formula that can equal breast milk .
In addition to the appropriate amounts of carbohydrate , protein , and fat , breast milk provides vitamins , minerals , digestive enzymes , and hormones .
Breast milk also contains antibodies and lymphocytes from the mother that help the baby resist infections .
The immune function of breast milk is individualized , as the mother , through her touching and taking care of the baby , comes into contact with pathogens that colonize the baby , and , as a consequence , her body makes the appropriate antibodies and immune cells .
At around four months of age , the internal iron supplies of the infant , held in the hepatic cells of the liver , are exhausted .
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that at this time that an iron supplement should be introduced , however , other health organisations such as the NHS in the UK have no such recommendation .
Breast milk contains less iron than formula , because it is more bioavailable as lactoferrin , which carries more safety for mothers and children than ferrous sulphate .
Both the AAP and the NHS recommend vitamin D supplementation for breastfed infants .
Vitamin D can be synthesised by the infant via exposure to sunlight , however , many infants are deficient due being kept indoors or living in areas with insufficient sunlight .
Formula is supplemented with vitamin D for this reason .
PRODUCTION Section::::Production .
Under the influence of the hormones prolactin and oxytocin , women produce milk after childbirth to feed the baby .
The initial milk produced is referred to as colostrum , which is high in the immunoglobulin IgA , which coats the gastrointestinal tract .
This helps to protect the newborn until its own immune system is functioning properly .
It also creates a mild laxative effect , expelling meconium and helping to prevent the build - up of bilirubin ( a contributory factor in jaundice ) .
Actual inability to produce enough milk is rare , with studies showing that mothers from developing countries experiencing nutritional hardship still produce amounts of milk of similar quality to that of mothers in developed countries .
There are many reasons a mother may not produce enough breast milk .
Some of the most common reasons are an improper latch ( i.e. , the baby does not connect efficiently with the nipple ) , not nursing or pumping enough to meet supply , certain medications ( including estrogen - containing hormonal contraceptives ) , illness , and dehydration .
A rarer reason is Sheehan 's syndrome , also known as postpartum hypopituitarism , which is associated with prolactin deficiency and may require hormone replacement .
The amount of milk produced depends on how often the mother is nursing and/or pumping : the more the mother nurses her baby or pumps , the more milk is produced .
It is beneficial to nurse when the baby wants to nurse rather than on a schedule .
A Cochrane review came to the conclusion that a greater volume of milk is expressed whilst listening to relaxing audio during breastfeeding , along with warming and massaging of the breast prior to and during feeding .
A greater volume of milk expressed can also be attributed to instances where the mother starts pumping milk sooner , even if the infant is unable to breastfeed .
Sodium concentration is higher in hand - expressed milk , when compared with the use of manual and electric pumps , and fat content is higher when the breast has been massaged , in conjunction with listening to relaxing audio .
This may be important for low birthweight infants .
If pumping , it is helpful to have an electric , high - grade pump so that all of the milk ducts are stimulated .
Galactagogues increase milk supply , although even herbal variants carry risks ; therefore non - pharmaceutical methods should be tried first .
COMPOSITION Section::::Composition .
+ Composition of human breast milk
colspan=2 Fat ( g/100 ml )
colspan=2 Protein ( g/100 ml ) colspan=2 Carbohydrate ( g/100 ml ) colspan=2 Minerals ( g/100 ml ) Breast milk contains complex proteins , lipids , carbohydrates and other biologically active components .
The composition changes over a single feed as well as over the period of lactation .
During the first few days after delivery , the mother produces colostrum .
This is a thin yellowish fluid that is the same fluid that sometimes leaks from the breasts during pregnancy .
It is rich in protein and antibodies that provide passive immunity to the baby ( the baby 's immune system is not fully developed at birth ) .
Colostrum also helps the newborn 's digestive system to grow and function properly .
Colostrum will gradually change to become mature milk .
In the first 3â€“4 days it will appear thin and watery and will taste very sweet ; later , the milk will be thicker and creamier .
Human milk quenches the baby 's thirst and hunger and provides the proteins , sugar , minerals , and antibodies that the baby needs .
In the 1980s and 1990s , lactation professionals ( De Cleats ) used to make a differentiation between foremilk and hindmilk .
But this differentiation causes confusion as there are not two types of milk .
Instead , as a baby breastfeeds , the fat content very gradually increases , with the milk becoming fattier and fattier over time .
The level of Immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) in breast milk remains high from day 10 until at least 7.5 months post - partum .
Human milk contains 0.8 % to 0.9 % protein , 4.5 % fat , 7.1 % carbohydrates , and 0.2 % ash ( minerals ) .
Carbohydrates are mainly lactose ; several lactose - based oligosaccharides have been identified as minor components .
The fat fraction contains specific triglycerides of palmitic and oleic acid ( O - P - O triglycerides ) , and also lipids with trans bonds ( see : trans fat ) .
The lipids are vaccenic acid , and Conjugated linoleic acid ( CLA ) accounting for up to 6 % of the human milk fat .
The principal proteins are alpha - lactalbumin , lactoferrin ( apo - lactoferrin ) , IgA , lysozyme , and serum albumin .
In an acidic environment such as the stomach , alpha - lactalbumin unfolds into a different form and binds oleic acid to form a complex called HAMLET that kills tumor cells .
This is thought to contribute to the protection of breastfed babies against cancer .
Non - protein nitrogen - containing compounds , making up 25 % of the milk 's nitrogen , include urea , uric acid , creatine , creatinine , amino acids , and nucleotides .
Breast milk has circadian variations ; some of the nucleotides are more commonly produced during the night , others during the day .
Mother 's milk has been shown to supply endocannabinoids ( the natural neurotransmitters that cannabis simulates ) 2-Arachidonoyl glycerol , anandamide , oleoylethanolamide , palmitoylethanolamide , N - arachidonoyl glycine , eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamide , docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide , N - palmitoleoyl - ethanolamine , dihomo - Î³ - linolenoylethanolamine , N - stearoylethanolamine ,
prostaglandin F2alpha ethanolamides and prostaglandin F2 ethanolamides , Palmitic acid esters of hydroxy - stearic acids ( PAHSAs ) .
They may act as an appetite stimulant , but they also regulate appetite so infants do n't eat too much .
That may be why formula - fed babies have a higher caloric intake than breastfed babies .
Breast milk is n't sterile , but contains as many as 600 different species of various bacteria , including beneficial Bifidobacterium breve , B. adolescentis , B. longum , B. bifidum , and B. dentium .
Breast milk contains a unique type of sugars , human milk oligosaccharides ( HMOs ) , which are not present in infant formula .
HMOs are not digested by the infant but help to make up the intestinal flora .
They act as decoy receptors that block the attachment of disease causing pathogens , which may help to prevent infectious diseases .
They also alter immune cell responses , which may benefit the infant .
To date ( 2015 ) more than a hundred different HMOs have been identified ; both the number and composition vary between women and each HMO may have a distinct functionality .
The breast milk of diabetic mothers has been shown to have a different composition from that of non - diabetic mothers .
It may contain elevated levels of glucose and insulin and decreased polyunsaturated fatty acids .
A dose - dependent effect of diabetic breast milk on increasing language delays in infants has also been noted , although doctors recommend that diabetic mothers breastfeed despite this potential risk .
Women breastfeeding should consult with their physician regarding substances that can be unwittingly passed to the infant via breast milk , such as alcohol , viruses ( HIV or HTLV-1 ) or medications .
Even though most infants infected with HIV contract the disease from breastfeeding , most infants that are breastfed by their HIV positive mothers never contract the disease .
While this paradoxical phenomenon suggests that the risk of HIV transmission between an HIV positive mother and her child via breastfeeding is small , studies have also shown that feeding infants with breast milk of HIV - positive mothers can actually have a preventative effect against HIV transmission between the mother and child .
This inhibitory effect against the infant contracting HIV is likely due to unspecified factors exclusively present in breast milk of HIV - positive mothers .
Most women that do not breastfeed use infant formula , but breast milk donated by volunteers to human milk banks can be obtained by prescription in some countries .
In addition , research has shown that women who rely on infant formula could minimize the gap between the level of immunity protection and cognitive abilities a breastfed child benefits from versus the degree to which a bottle - fed child benefits from them .
This can be done by supplementing formula - fed infants with bovine milk fat globule membranes ( MFGM ) meant to mimic the positive effects of the MFGMs which are present in human breast milk .
STORAGE OF EXPRESSED BREAST MILK Section::::Storage of expressed breast milk .
Expressed breast milk can be stored .
Lipase may cause thawed milk to taste soapy or rancid due to milk fat breakdown .
It is still safe to use , and most babies will drink it .
Scalding it will prevent rancid taste at the expense of antibodies .
It should be stored with airtight seals .
Some plastic bags are designed for storage periods of less than 72 hours .
Others can be used for up to 12 months if frozen .
This table describes safe storage time limits . !

Maximum storage time COMPARISON TO OTHER MILKS Section::::Comparison to other milks .
All mammalian species produce milk , but the composition of milk for each species varies widely and other kinds of milk are often very different from human breast milk .
As a rule , the milk of mammals that nurse frequently ( including human babies ) is less rich , or more watery , than the milk of mammals whose young nurse less often .
Human milk is noticeably thinner and sweeter than cow 's milk .
Whole cow 's milk contains too little iron , retinol , vitamin E , vitamin C , vitamin D , unsaturated fats or essential fatty acids for human babies .
Whole cow 's milk also contains too much protein , sodium , potassium , phosphorus and chloride which may put a strain on an infant 's immature kidneys .
In addition , the proteins , fats and calcium in whole cow 's milk are more difficult for an infant to digest and absorb than the ones in breast milk .
Evaporated milk may be easier to digest due to the processing of the protein but is still nutritionally inadequate .
Some infants are allergic to cow 's milk protein , this problem may be associated with infant formulas derived from cow 's milk .

In addition to providing essential nourishment to infants , human milk ; i.e. , breast milk , has a number of valuable uses , especially medicinal uses , for both children and adults .
It has been used medicinally for thousands of years .
Breast milk contains strong antibodies and antitoxins that many people believe promote healing and better overall health .
However , breast milk lacks sterile and antiseptic properties if a nursing mother is infected with certain communicable diseases , such as HIV and CMV , as breast milk can transmit such diseases to infants and other people .
Breast milk has been used as a home remedy for minor ailments , such as conjunctivitis , insect bites and stings , contact dermatitis , and infected wounds , burns , and abrasions .
Breast milk has also been used alternatively to boost the immune system of ill persons having viral gastroenteritis , influenza , the common cold , pneumonia , etc . , because of its immunologic properties .
However , breast milk should never be seen or construed as a " cure - all " .
Some medical experts are convinced that breast milk can induce apoptosis in some types of cancer cells .
However , more research and evidence are needed in this area of cancer treatment .
A minority of people , including restaurateurs Hans Lochen of Switzerland and Daniel Angerer of Austria , who operates a restaurant in New York City , have used human breast milk , or at least advocated its use , as a substitute for cow 's milk in dairy products and food recipes .
Tammy Frissell - Deppe , a family counsellor specialized in attachment parenting , published a book , titled A Breastfeeding Mother 's Secret Recipes , providing a lengthy compilation of detailed food and beverage recipes containing human breast milk .
The animal rights organization known as PETA ignited a firestorm of criticism when it urged a dairy company to replace the cow 's milk they use in their ice cream products with human breast milk as a way to stop cattle abuse .
Human breast milk is not produced or distributed industrially or commercially , because the use of human breast milk as an adult food is considered unusual to the majority of cultures around the world , and most disapprove of such a practice .
Attempts to formulate soap from breast milk have also been made , and those using it claim that its effectiveness as a cleanser is greater than , or equal to ,
that of traditional soaps .
DIFFICULTIES Section::::Difficulties .
Almost all medicines pass into breastmilk in small amounts .
Some have no effect on the baby and can be used while breastfeeding .
Women with hypothyroidism may be unable to produce milk .
Alcohol use during pregnancy carries a significant risk of serious birth defects , but consuming alcohol after the birth of the infant is considered safe .
Pesticides and other toxic substances bioaccumulate ; i.e. , creatures higher up the food chain will store more of them in their body fat .
This is an issue in particular for the Inuit , whose traditional diet is predominantly meat .
Studies are looking at the effects of polychlorinated biphenyls and persistent organic pollutants in the body ; the breast milk of Inuit mothers is extraordinarily high in toxic compounds .
EXTRAORDINARY CONSUMPTION Section::::Extraordinary consumption .
In Costa Rica , there have been trials to produce cheese and custard from human milk as an alternative to weaning .
A controversial Swiss restaurateur has created a menu based around foods cooked in human breast milk .
An Icecreamist in London 's Covent Garden started selling an ice cream named Baby Gaga in February 2011 .
Each serving costs Â£ 14 .
All the milk was donated by a Mrs Hiley who earns Â£ 15 for every 10 ounces and calls it a " great recession beater " .
The ice cream sold out on its first day .
Despite the success of the new flavour , the Westminster Council officers removed the product from the menu to make sure that it was , as they said , " fit for human consumption . "
While there is no scientific evidence that shows that breast milk is more advantageous for adults than cow 's milk , according to several 2015 news sources breast milk is being used by bodybuilders for its nutritional value .
In a February 2015 ABC News article one former competitive body builder said , " It is n't common , but I 've known people who have done this .
It 's certainly talked about quite a bit on the bodybuilding forums on the Internet . "
Calling bodybuilders " a strange breed of individuals , " he said , " Even if this type of thing is completely unsupported by research , they 're prone to gym lore and willing to give it a shot if there is any potential effect . "
At the time the article was written , in the U.S.
the price of breast milk procured from milk banks that pasteurize the milk , and have expensive quality and safety controls , was about $ 10 an ounce , and the price in the alternative market online , bought directly from mothers , ranges from $ 1 to $ 4 per US fluid ounce , compared to cow 's milk at about $ 3.44 a gallon .
MARKET Section::::Market .
There is a market for human breast milk , both in the form of wet nurse service and milk product .
As a product , breast milk is exchanged by human milk banks as well as directly between milk donors and customers mediated by websites on the Internet .
Human milk banks generally have standardized measures for screening donors and storing the milk , while donors on websites vary in regard to these measures .
A study in 2013 came to the conclusion that 74 % of breast milk samples from providers found from websites were colonized with Gram - negative bacteria or had more than 10,000 colony - forming units / mL of aerobic bacteria .
Growth happens during transit .
According to the FDA , the bacteria in fresh milk doubles every 20 minutes .
Breast milk is considered to be healthier than cow 's milk and infant formula when it comes to feeding an infant in the first 6 months of life , but only under extreme situations do international health organizations support feeding an infant breast milk from a healthy wet nurse rather than that of its biological mother .
One reason is because the unregulated breast milk market is fraught with risks such as drugs of abuse and prescription medications being present in donated breast milk .
The transmission of these substances through breast milk can do more harm than good when it comes to the health outcomes of the infant recipient .
