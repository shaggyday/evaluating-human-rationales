ABSOLUTE PITCH Absolute pitch ( AP ) , widely referred to as perfect pitch , is a rare auditory phenomenon characterized by the ability of a person to identify or re - create a given musical note without the benefit of a reference tone .
AP can be demonstrated via linguistic labeling ( " naming " a note ) , auditory imagery , or sensorimotor responses .
For example , an AP possessor can accurately reproduce a heard tone on a musical instrument without " hunting " for the correct pitch .
Researchers estimate the occurrence of AP to be 1 in 10,000 people .
Generally , absolute pitch implies some or all of the following abilities , achieved without a reference tone :
* Identify by name individual pitches ( e.g. F , A , G , C ) played on various instruments .
* Name the key of a given piece of tonal music .
* Reproduce a piece of tonal music in the correct key days after hearing it .
* Identify and name all the tones of a given chord or other tonal mass .
* Accurately sing a named pitch .
* Name the pitches of common everyday sounds such as car horns and alarms .
* Name the frequency of a pitch ( e.g. that G4 is 415Hz ) after hearing it .
People may have absolute pitch along with the ability of relative pitch , and relative and absolute pitch work together in actual musical listening and practice , but strategies in using each skill vary .
Those with absolute pitch may train their relative pitch and there has been a reported case of 6 adults in China ( with previous musical training ) acquiring absolute pitch through specific tonal training .
Furthermore , two studies by Harvard and the University of Chicago have shown Valproate , a medication used to treat epilepsy and severe depression , may re - open the " critical period " of learning making the acquisition of absolute pitch , as well as languages , potentially as efficient for adults as for children .
Adults who possess relative pitch but do not already have absolute pitch can also learn " pseudo - absolute pitch " and become able to identify notes in a way that superficially resembles absolute pitch .
Moreover , training absolute pitch can require considerable motivation , time , and effort , and learning is not retained without constant practice and reinforcement .
SCIENTIFIC STUDIES HISTORY OF STUDY AND TERMINOLOGIES Section::::Scientific studies .
Section::::History of study and terminologies .
Scientific study of absolute pitch appears to have commenced in the 19th century , focusing on the phenomenon of musical pitch and methods of measuring it .
It would have been difficult for any notion of absolute pitch to have formed earlier because pitch references were not consistent .
For example , the note now known as ' A ' varied in different local or national musical traditions between what would now be considered as G sharp and B flat before the standardisation of the late 19th century .
While the term absolute pitch , or absolute ear , was in use by the late 19th century by both British and German researchers , its application was not universal ; other terms such as musical ear , absolute tone consciousness , or positive pitch were also used to refer to the ability .
The skill is not exclusively musical , or limited to human perception ; absolute pitch has been demonstrated in animals such as bats , wolves , gerbils , and birds , for whom specific pitches facilitate identification of mates or meals .
DIFFERENCE IN COGNITION , NOT ELEMENTARY SENSATION
Section::::Difference in cognition , not elementary sensation .
Physically and functionally , the auditory system of an absolute listener does not appear to be different from that of a non - absolute listener .
Rather , " it reflects a particular ability to analyze frequency information , presumably involving high - level cortical processing .
"
Absolute pitch is an act of cognition , needing memory of the frequency , a label for the frequency ( such as " B - flat " ) , and exposure to the range of sound encompassed by that categorical label .
Absolute pitch may be directly analogous to recognizing colors , phonemes ( speech sounds ) , or other categorical perception of sensory stimuli .
Just as most people have learned to recognize and name the color blue by the range of frequencies of the electromagnetic radiation that are perceived as light , it is possible that those who have been exposed to musical notes together with their names early in life will be more likely to identify , for example , the note C. Absolute pitch may also be related to certain genes , possibly an autosomal dominant genetic trait , though it " might be nothing more than a general human capacity whose expression is strongly biased by the level and type of exposure to music that people experience in a given culture . "
INFLUENCE
BY MUSIC EXPERIENCE Section::::Influence by music experience .
Absolute pitch sense appears to be influenced by cultural exposure to music , especially in the familiarization of the equal - tempered C - major scale .
Most of the absolute listeners that were tested in this respect identified the C - major tones more reliably and , except for B , more quickly than the five " black key " tones , which corresponds to the higher prevalence of these tones in ordinary musical experience .
One study of Dutch non - musicians also demonstrated a bias toward using C - major tones in ordinary speech , especially on syllables related to emphasis .
LINGUISTICS Section::::Linguistics .
Absolute pitch is more common among speakers of tonal languages , such as most dialects of Chinese or Vietnamese , which often depend on pitch variation as the means of distinguishing words that otherwise sound the same — e.g . , Mandarin with four possible tonal variations , Cantonese with six , Southern Min with seven or eight ( depending on dialect ) , and Vietnamese with six .
Speakers of Sino - Tibetan languages have been reported to speak a word in the same absolute pitch ( within a quarter - tone ) on different days ; it has therefore been suggested that absolute pitch may be acquired by infants when they learn to speak a tonal language ( and possibly also by infants when they learn to speak a pitch - accent language ) .
However , the brains of tonal - language speakers do not naturally process musical sound as language ; perhaps such speakers are more likely to acquire absolute pitch for musical tones when they later receive musical training .
Many native speakers of a tone language , even those with little musical training , are observed to sing a given song consistently with regard to pitch .
Among music students of East Asian ethnic heritage , those who speak a tone language very fluently have a much higher prevalence of absolute pitch than those who do not speak a tone language .
It is possible that African level - tone languages — such as Yoruba , with three pitch levels , and Mambila , with four — may be better suited to study the role of absolute pitch in speech than the pitch and contour tone languages of East Asia .
Speakers of European languages have been found to make subconscious use of an absolute pitch memory when speaking .
PERCEPTION
Section::::Perception .
Absolute pitch is the ability to perceive pitch class and to mentally categorize sounds according to perceived pitch class .
A pitch class is the set of all pitches that are a whole number of octaves apart .
While the boundaries of musical pitch categories vary among human cultures , the recognition of octave relationships is a natural characteristic of the mammalian auditory system .
Accordingly , absolute pitch is not the ability to estimate a pitch value from the dimension of pitch - evoking frequency ( 30–5000 Hz ) , but to identify a pitch class category within the dimension of pitch class ( e.g. , C - C - D ... B - C ) .
An absolute listener 's sense of hearing is typically no keener than that of a non - absolute ( " normal " ) listener .
Absolute pitch does not depend upon a refined ability to perceive and discriminate gradations of sound frequencies , but upon detecting and categorizing a subjective perceptual quality typically referred to as " chroma " .
The two tasks — of identification ( recognizing and naming a pitch ) and discrimination ( detecting changes or differences in rate of vibration ) — are accomplished with different brain mechanisms .
SPECIAL POPULATIONS Section::::Special populations .
The prevalence of absolute pitch is higher among those who are blind from birth as a result of optic nerve hypoplasia .
Absolute pitch is considerably more common among those whose early childhood was spent in East Asia .
This might seem to be a genetic difference ; however , people of East Asian ancestry who are reared in North America are significantly less likely to develop absolute pitch than those raised in East Asia , so the difference is more probably explained by experience .
The language that is spoken may be an important factor ; many East Asians speak tonal languages such as Mandarin and Cantonese , while others ( such as those in Japan and certain provinces of Korea ) speak pitch - accent languages , and the prevalence of absolute pitch may be partly explained by exposure to pitches together with meaningful musical labels very early in life .
Absolute pitch ability has higher prevalence among those with Williams syndrome and those with an autism spectrum disorder , with rates as high as 30 % claimed , stating that the rate among musicians in general is far lower .
A non - verbal piano - matching method resulted in a correlation of 97 % between autism and absolute pitch , with a 53 % correlation in non - autistic observers .
NATURE VS .
NURTURE Section::::Nature vs. nurture .
Absolute pitch might be achievable by any human being during a critical period of auditory development , after which period cognitive strategies favor global and relational processing .
Proponents of the critical - period theory agree that the presence of absolute pitch ability is dependent on learning , but there is disagreement about whether training causes absolute skills to occur or lack of training causes absolute perception to be overwhelmed and obliterated by relative perception of musical intervals .
There may be a genetic locus for absolute pitch ability , which locus would suggest a genetic basis for its presence or absence .
A genetic basis , should it exist , might represent either a predisposition for learning the ability or signal the likelihood of its spontaneous occurrence .
Researchers have been trying to teach absolute pitch ability in laboratory settings for more than a century , and various commercial absolute - pitch training courses have been offered to the public since the early 1900s .
However , no adult has ever been documented to have acquired absolute listening ability , because all adults who have been formally tested after AP training have failed to demonstrate " an unqualified level of accuracy ... comparable to that of AP possessors " .
PITCH MEMORY RELATED TO MUSICAL CONTEXT Section::::Pitch memory related to musical context .
While very few people have the ability to name a pitch with no external reference , pitch memory can be activated by repeated exposure .
People who are not skilled singers will often sing popular songs in the correct key , and can usually recognize when TV themes have been shifted into the wrong key .
Members of the Venda culture in South Africa also sing familiar children 's songs in the key in which the songs were learned .
This phenomenon is apparently unrelated to musical training .
The skill may be associated more closely with vocal production .
Violin students learning the Suzuki method are required to memorize each composition in a fixed key and play it from memory on their instrument , but they are not required to sing .
When tested , these students did not succeed in singing the memorized Suzuki songs in the original , fixed key .
POSSIBLE PROBLEMS Section::::Possible problems .
Musicians with absolute perception may experience difficulties which do not exist for other musicians .
Because absolute listeners are capable of recognizing that a musical composition has been transposed from its original key , or that a pitch is being produced at a nonstandard frequency ( either sharp or flat ) , a musician with absolute pitch may become distressed upon perceiving tones believed to be " wrong " or hearing a piece of music " in the wrong key .
" This can especially apply to Baroque music that is recorded in Baroque tuning ( usually A = 415 Hz as opposed to 440 Hz , i.e. , roughly a half step or semitone lower than standard concert pitch ) .
An absolute listener may also use absolute strategies for tasks which are more efficiently accomplished with relative strategies , such as transposition or producing harmony for tones whose frequencies do not match standard equal temperament .
It is also possible for some musicians to have displaced absolute pitch , where all notes are slightly flat or slightly sharp of their respective pitch as defined by a given convention .
This may arise from learning the pitch names from an instrument that was tuned to a concert pitch convention other than the one in use , e.g. ,
A = 435 Hz ( the Paris Opera convention of the late 19th and early 20th centuries ) as opposed to the Anglo - American modern standard A = 440 Hz .
When playing in groups with other musicians , this may lead to playing in a tonality that is slightly different from that of the rest of the group .
SYNESTHESIA Section::::Synesthesia .
Absolute pitch shows a genetic overlap with synesthesia / ideasthesia , and some individuals with music - related synesthesia also have perfect pitch .
They may associate certain notes or keys with different colors , enabling them to tell what any note or key is .
It is unknown how many people with perfect pitch are also synesthetes .
CORRELATION WITH MUSICAL TALENT Section::::Correlation with musical talent .
Absolute pitch is not a prerequisite for skilled musical performance or composition .
However , musicians with absolute pitch tend to perform better on musical transcription tasks ( controlling for age of onset and amount of musical training ) compared with those without absolute pitch .
It has been argued that musicians with absolute pitch perform worse than those without absolute pitch on recognition of musical intervals .
However , experiments on which this conclusion was based contained an artifact , and when this artifact was removed , absolute pitch possessors were found to perform better than nonpossessors on recognition of musical intervals .
Owing to uncertainty in the historical record , it is often impossible to determine whether notable composers and musicians of the past had absolute pitch .
Since absolute pitch is rare in European musical culture , claims that any particular musician possessed it are difficult to evaluate .
Among composers of the Baroque and Classical eras , evidence is available only for Mozart , who is documented to have demonstrated the ability at age 7 .
Experts have only surmised that Beethoven had it , as indicated from some excerpts from his letters .
By the 19th century , it became more common for the presence of absolute pitch to be recorded , identifying the ability to be present in musicians such as Camille Saint - Saëns and John Philip Sousa .
RELATIVE PITCH Section::::Relative pitch .
Many musicians have quite good relative pitch , a skill that can be learned through ear training .
With practice , it is possible to listen to a single known pitch once ( from a pitch pipe or a tuning fork ) and then have stable , reliable pitch identification by comparing the notes heard to the stored memory of the tonic pitch .
Unlike absolute pitch , this skill is dependent on a recently perceived tonal center .
