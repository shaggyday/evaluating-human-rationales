The song 's music was composed by James Horner , its lyrics were written by Will Jennings , while the production was handled by Walter Afanasieff , Horner and Simon Franglen .

It was also included in the list of Songs of the Century by the Recording Industry Association of America and the National Endowment for the Arts .
The music video was directed by Bille Woodruff and released at the end of 1997 .
Dion performed the song to honor the 20th anniversary of the film at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards on May 21 , 2017 .
With worldwide sales estimated at 20 million copies , it became the second best - selling single by a female artist in history , and the eighth overall .
ORIGINS Section::::Origins .
James Horner had originally composed the music for the song as an instrumental motif which he used in several scenes during Titanic ; the main theme of the song being inspired by the song " Flying Dutchman " by Jethro Tull .
He then wanted to prepare a full vocal version of it , for use in the end credits of the film .
Lyricist Will Jennings was hired , who wrote the lyrics " from the point of view of a person of a great age looking back so many years . "
Director James Cameron did not want such a song , but Will Jennings went ahead anyway and wrote the lyrics .
When Dion originally heard the song , she did not want to record it as she felt she was pushing her luck by singing another film theme song after Beauty and the Beast .
Horner showed the piano sketch to Simon Franglen , who was working with him on electronic textures and synthesizers for the film score .
Franglen , who had , himself , worked with Dion for several years on many of her major hits to date , programmed and arranged an extensive demo to take to Dion .
RECORDING
Section::::Recording .
Tommy Mottola claimed that Dion recorded the song in one take , and that demo is what was released .
As Cameron felt obligated to include a theme song to promote the movie , Glen Brunman also stated that the soundtrack album was supposed to be " No song , no Céline . "
Dion 's manager and husband René Angélil convinced her to sing on this demo version , which she had not done for many years .
Horner waited until Cameron was in an appropriate mood before presenting him with the song .
After playing it several times , Cameron declared his approval , even though he worried that he might be criticized for " going commercial at the end of the movie " .
Cameron also wanted to appease anxious studio executives and " saw that a hit song from his movie could only be a positive factor in guaranteeing its completion . "
COMPOSITION Section::::Composition .
The song is written in the key of E major , though the leitmotif ( as heard in the intro ) is in the relative key of C minor .
The verses follow the chord progression of E – Bsus4–Aadd9–E – B.
The chorus has the chord progression of Cm – B – A – B.
The song modulates to F minor in the final chorus , and ends in the key of A major .
It contains heavy emphasis on the instrumental arranging .
Usage of flute is prominent , backed by melodic use of strings and rhythm guitars .
The song features both acoustic and electronic instrumentation .
Dion 's vocal performance is described as " emotional " and " demanding " by Pandora radio .
VERSIONS Section::::Versions .
The original
Horner / Franglen produced " demo " version of the ballad runs a little over five minutes and has an extended ending with longer , segmented vocalizations by Dion .
Franglen mixed the final film and soundtrack version , expanding on the demo and adding orchestra to the final chorus .
It is this version which appears on the Titanic soundtrack album and is also played over the ending credits of the film .
When the single was to be released to radio , it was produced further by Walter Afanasieff who added string and electric guitar , as well as rearranged portions of the song .
This version , which runs a little over four and a half minutes , appears on both the 4-track maxi single and Dion 's album Let 's Talk About Love .
At the height of the song 's popularity , some radio stations in the US and the UK played an edited version of the song , that had dramatic moments of dialog from the Jack and Rose lead characters in the film inserted in between Dion 's vocal lines .
CRITICAL RECEPTION Section::::Critical reception .
AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that this song " shines the most brilliantly " and marked it as a standout track .
Another AllMusic reviewer , single editor Heather Phares , who rated the single 4 out 5 stars , wrote , " Indeed , her performances of it on VH1 Divas , the 1998 Academy Awards ( wearing the film 's ' Heart of the Ocean ' pendant , no less ) , and on her 1997 album Let 's Talk About Love have cemented ' My Heart Will Go On ' as the quintessence of Dion 's sweeping , romantic style . "
Yahoo.com described the song as an " emotional power ballad that perfectly captured [ Titanic 's ] romantic yearning " .
Vulture said that it is a powerful song and has " one of the most glorious key changes in recorded music history " , and that " its legacy is eclipsed only by " Whitney Houston 's " admittedly far superior " song " I Will Always Love You " .
Washington Post appreciated how the song was not just tagged on the end of the three - hour film , but has a lyrical motif that was already placed throughout the key moments of the film 's love story in order to create a musical narrative .
In latter years , " My Heart Will Go On " proved not to be popular with readers of Rolling Stone magazine ; nor did it become popular with Kate Winslet , who played Rose DeWitt Bukater – the notional protagonist of the song – in the film .
In 2011 , Rolling Stone readers rated it the 7th worst song of the ' 90s , with the magazine writing , " Celine Dion 's song and the movie have aged very poorly ...
Now [ the song ] probably just makes you cringe " .
Winslet stated that the song made her feel " like throwing up " , due to people 's tendency to start playing it when she was around :
" I wish I could say , ' Oh listen , everybody !
It 's the Celine Dion song ! '
But I do n't .
I just have to sit there , you know , kind of straight - faced with a massive internal eye roll .
"
The Atlantic attributed the song 's decline in popularity to its overexposure and added that over the years there have been many jokes that parody the song 's lyrics by claiming " My Heart Will Go On " goes " on and on and on " .
Vulture reasoned that it has become fashionable to dislike the song because it " encapsulates most everything that once - enthusiastic moviegoers now dislike about Titanic : It 's outdated , cheesy , and overly dramatic " .
Maxim deemed it " the second most tragic event ever to result from that fabled ocean liner " .
On September 11 , 2010 , Matthew Wilkening of AOL Radio ranked the song No . 11 on his list of the " 100 Worst Songs Ever " , while stating a new rule : " From now on , the Canadian warbler , and not the captain , has to go down with this ship .
" This was in reference to the Titanic itself .

Sissel Kyrkjebø recorded the song for the film in 1997 , but Celine Dion 's vocals was preferred due to James Horner 's decision to support Dion 's career .
In an interview from December 2014 , Horner quotes : " When I had completed the Titanic [ movie ] , I had to decide for Celine Dion or Sissel [ 's ] [ vocals ] .
Sissel I am very close , while Celine I had known since she was 18 , and I had already written three film songs for [ her ] .
But that was before Celine was known and filmmakers and marketing people had not done what they should have done for Celine and [ her ] songs .
So I felt I owed her a Titanic chance , but I could [ still ] have used Sissel there . "
