EARLY LIFE
Section::::Early life .
Hart was raised just outside Chicago for the first few years of his life , until his father died when he was seven .
His mother remarried , and Hart 's stepfather inspired him to play sports , even pushing him out of a car to participate in a football skills competition , which he won .
It was at Niles West High School in Skokie at age 13 when he started playing football as a quarterback , though he lettered in basketball for three years and also played baseball .
He received a football scholarship to play for the Southern Illinois Salukis from 1963 through 1965 .
After not being drafted in the 1966 Draft , Hart 's former coach Don Shroyer invited him to a tryout with the Cardinals .
He impressed the team and was signed soon after .
PLAYING CAREER

He played in relief of Terry Nofsinger in the final game of the 1966 season on December 17 for the Cardinals ( who had lost Charley Johnson due to fulfilling an ROTC committment ) , and he threw 4-of-11 for 29 yards in a 38 - 10 loss to Cleveland .
After the season , Hart was left to be the starter .
For the 1967 season , he started all 14 contests , going 6 - 7 - 1 while throwing for 3,008 yards with 19 touchdowns and 30 interceptions on a 48.4 completion percentage .
Both his yards and interceptions would prove to be career highs .
The following year , he and the team improved slightly , with him going 8 - 3 - 1 in the 12 games he started ( with Charley Johnson starting two games ) , throwing for 2,059 yards with 15 touchdowns to 18 interceptions on a 44.3 completion percentage .

These early career teams were not particularly great ( 31–33–5 in his first seven years ) , the hire of coach Don Coryell in 1973 turned things around .
From 1974 to 1976 , he guided the Cardinals to three straight ten - plus - win seasons along with back - to - back division crowns in 1974 and 1975 , leading the Cardiac Cards to ten game - winning drives during that three - year span .
However , in t postseason he went a combined 40 for 81 in passing with two touchdowns and 4 interceptions as his Cards were eliminated in the first round twice .
In 1976 , he threw for a career high completion percentage of 56.2 % , complimenting that with 2,946 yards for 18 touchdowns and 13 interceptions , with the team going 10 - 4 .
By the time the Cardinals returned to the playoffs again at the conclusion of the 1982 - 83 season , Neil Lomax had already established himself as the starter and Hart did not play .
He stayed with the team for one more season as the back - up to Lomax before being released after the 1983 season .
Hart was signed by the Redskins to back up Joe Theismann for the 1984 season , playing little in that season before retiring in the off - season .
