SEASON 2
Section::::Season 2 .
A 100 % approval rating for the second season was reported by Rotten Tomatoes , with an average rating of 7.54/10 based on 26 reviews , and a critical consensus reading , " In its second season , The Sinner establishes itself as an engrossing why - dunnit thriller series with staying power .
"
Metacritic assigned a score of 75 out of 100 based on 16 critics for the second season , indicating " generally favorable reviews " .
Once again praising the writing and performances , several critics noting that the follow - up series surpassed expectations for season two , as star Jessica Biel 's character is not returning from the first season , which also used up the source material from the original book .
Alex McLevy of The A.V. Club wrote a rave review of the first few episodes , in particular the performance of Carrie Coon as the mysterious Vera Walker .
McLevy wrote that the second season could be even better than the first , noting , " Two things keep it from feeling like a rehash of season one : the excellent choices in new narrative twists made by writer - creator Derek Simonds , and the caliber of talent involved in bringing it to life .
Chief among the latter group is Carrie Coon , who ... brings a wonderful fusion of frazzled humanism and sinister duplicity to the part , another magnetic performance by the actor that elevates the material and lends gravitas to some of the more daffily implausible turns . "
Ben Travers of indieWire wrote , " Derek Simonds assembled a helluva team for an intriguing follow - up season .
The first three episodes of Season 2 match the tone and intensity of the writer 's gripping debut , while new cast members Tracy Letts , Natalie Paul , and Carrie Coon more than make up for any holes left by the original cast . ...
Season 2 has enough going on it could spin off the rails , but the mere fact it has so much working for it thus far is a big win for everyone involved .
The Sinner is no one - hit wonder . "
