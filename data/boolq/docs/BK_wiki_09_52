RAIN OF ANIMALS Raining animals is a rare meteorological phenomenon in which flightless animals fall from the sky .
Such occurrences have been reported in many countries throughout history .
One hypothesis is that tornadic waterspouts sometimes pick up creatures such as fish or frogs , and carry them for up to several miles .
However , this aspect of the phenomenon has never been witnessed by scientists .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Rain of flightless animals and things has been reported throughout history .
In the first century AD , Roman naturalist Pliny The Elder documented storms of frogs and fish .
In 1794 , French soldiers saw toads fall from the sky during heavy rain at Lalain , near the French city of Lille .
Rural inhabitants in Yoro , Honduras , claim ' fish rain ' happens there every summer , a phenomenon they call Lluvia de Peces .
EXPLANATIONS Section::::Explanations .
French physicist André - Marie Ampère ( 1775 – 1836 ) was among the first scientists to take seriously accounts of raining animals .
Addressing the Society of Natural Sciences , Ampère suggested that at times frogs and toads roam the countryside in large numbers , and that violent winds could pick them up and carry them great distances .
After a reported rain of fish in Singapore in 1861 , French naturalist Francis de Laporte de Castelnau speculated that a migration of walking catfish had taken place , dragging themselves over land from one puddle to another , following the rain .
Sometimes the animals survive the fall , suggesting the animals are dropped shortly after extraction .
Several witnesses of raining frogs describe the animals as startled but healthy , and exhibiting relatively normal behavior shortly after the event .
In some incidents , the animals are frozen to death or even completely encased in ice .
There are examples where the product of the rain is not intact animals , but shredded body parts .
A current scientific hypothesis involves tornadic waterspouts : a tornado that forms over the water .
Under this hypothesis , a tornadic waterspout transports animals to relatively high altitudes , carrying them over large distances .
This hypothesis appears supported by the type of animals in these rains : small and light , usually aquatic , and by the suggestion that the rain of animals is often preceded by a storm .
However , the theory does not account for how all the animals involved in each individual incident would be from only one species , and not a group of similarly - sized animals from a single area .
In the case of birds , storms may overcome a flock in flight , especially in times of migration .
The image to the right shows an example wherein a group of bats is overtaken by a thunderstorm .
In the image , the bats are in the red zone , which corresponds to winds moving away from the radar station , and enter into a mesocyclone associated with a tornado ( in green ) .
These events may occur easily with birds , which can get killed in flight , or stunned and then fall ( unlike flightless creatures , which first have to be lifted into the air by an outside force ) .
Sometimes this happens in large groups , for instance , the blackbirds falling from the sky in Beebe , Arkansas , United States on December 31 , 2010 .
It is common for birds to become disoriented ( for example , because of bad weather or fireworks ) and collide with objects such as trees or buildings , killing them or stunning them into falling to their death .
The number of blackbirds killed in Beebe is not spectacular considering the size of their congregations , which can be in the millions .
The event in Beebe , however , captured the imagination and led to more reports in the media of birds falling from the sky across the globe , such as in Sweden and Italy , though many scientists claim such mass deaths are common occurrences but usually go unnoticed .
In contrast , it is harder to find a plausible explanation for rains of terrestrial animals .

The English idiom "
it is raining cats and dogs " , used to describe an especially , is of unknown etymology , and is not necessarily related to the " raining animals " phenomenon .
The phrase ( with " polecats " instead of " cats " ) was used at least since the 17th century .
A number of possible etymologies have been put forward to explain the phrase ; for example : * Drainage systems on buildings in 17th - century Europe were poor , and may have disgorged their contents during heavy showers , including the corpses of any animals that had accumulated in them .
This occurrence is documented in Jonathan Swift 's 1710 poem ' Description of a City Shower ' , in which he describes " Drowned puppies , stinking sprats , all drenched in mud,/Dead cats and turnip - tops come tumbling down the flood . "
* " Cats and dogs " may be a corruption of the Greek word Katadoupoi , referring to the waterfalls on the Nile , possibly through the old French word catadupe ( " waterfall " ) .
* The Greek phrase " kata doksa " , which means " contrary to expectation " is often applied to heavy rain , but there is no evidence to support the theory that it was borrowed by English speakers .
In addition to at least one folk etymology : * An " explanation " widely circulated by email claimed that in 16th - century Europe , when peasant homes were commonly thatched , animals could crawl into the thatch to find shelter from the elements and would fall out during heavy rain .
However , there seems to be no evidence in support of either assertion .
There may not be a logical explanation ; the phrase may have been used just for its nonsensical humor value , like other equivalent English expressions ( " it is raining pitchforks " , " hammer handles " , etc . ) .
Other languages have equally bizarre expressions for heavy rain :
