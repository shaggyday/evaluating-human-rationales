COUPE
DES MOUSQUETAIRES La Coupe des Mousquetaires ( English : The Musketeers ' Trophy ) is the trophy awarded to the winner of the Men 's Singles competition at the French Open .
The trophy was created in its current form in 1981 , after Philippe Chatrier , then president of the Fédération Française de Tennis ( FFT ) , offered jewellers in Paris the opportunity to redesign it .
It is supposed to symbolise the victories of four famous French tennis players , who together make up the " Four Musketeers " : Jacques Brugnon , Jean Borotra , Henri Cochet and René Lacoste .
The design eventually chosen was that of the family jeweller Mellerio .
The trophy has a wide aperture , bordered with vine leaves and decorated with two swan - shaped handles .
The trophy is housed in the office of the president of the FFT , and is only removed once every year when the Men 's Singles winner at the French open is announced .
The winner does not get to keep the actual trophy ; a new replica is produced every year .
The replica , which is always slightly smaller than the original , is made from a sheet of solid silver , and takes over one hundred hours to complete .
The trophy weighs around 14 kg , is 21 cm high and 19 cm wide .
The female equivalent of La Coupe des Mousquetaires , awarded to the winner of the Women 's Singles competition , is the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen .
An exact replica of the Coupe des Mousquetaires was awarded to Rafael Nadal for his 10th win at the French Open in June 2017 .
It is the same exact size and made of the same material as the original trophy but instead of a marble base it is just a simple black colored base .
On the front of the base of Nadal 's trophy it says ' Decima ' meaning ' Tenth ' in Spanish and it also states all 10 of Nadal 's French Open titles up to that date ( 2005 - 08 , 2010 - 14 , 2017 ) .
Nadal went on to win an eleventh title in 2018 .
