ROUND OF 16 FRANCE VS ARGENTINA
Section::::Round of 16 .
Section::::France vs Argentina .
The teams had faced each other in 11 previous matches , including two World Cup group stage matches , both won by Argentina ( 1–0 in 1930 , and 2–1 in 1978 ) .
After nine minutes , Antoine Griezmann 's 25-yard free - kick crashed back off Franco Armani 's crossbar .
After picking the ball up deep inside his own half , Kylian Mbappé set off on a run that was halted when Marcos Rojo hauled him down just inside the area .
Griezmann stepped up and converted from the spot , sending the ball low to Armani 's right .
Four minutes before the interval , Ángel Di María shot from distance with his left foot to beat Hugo Lloris into the top right corner of the net .
Three minutes after the restart , Éver Banega 's free - kick was headed out towards Lionel Messi whose effort towards goal from the right was diverted past Lloris by Gabriel Mercado with his left leg .
Nine minutes later , Lucas Hernández 's cross from the left found Benjamin Pavard , who shot a half - volley from outside the area , sending it into Armani 's top - right corner .
Mbappé put France ahead again in the 64th minute when he picked up a loose ball in the left of the area , found a yard of space and fired in low with his left foot under Armani .
His second – a first - time low finish from the right of the penalty area with his right foot – followed just four minutes later .
Sergio Agüero nodded home in the third minute of stoppage time from a Messi cross from the right .
Argentina had a final chance to score , but the ball was deflected , dumping them out of the World Cup .
This game was hailed as " one of the greatest World Cup games of all time " by The Independent .
Didier Deschamps is now the longest - serving coach in the history of the French national team , with his 80th game in charge of France , moving ahead of his predecessor Raymond Domenech .
Mbappé became the first teenager to score at least twice in a World Cup tournament since Michael Owen in 1998 , and the first teenager to score at least twice in a single World Cup match since Pelé netted twice for Brazil against Sweden in the 1958 final .
Argentina are the first team to score at least three goals but still lose a World Cup match since the Soviet Union vs Belgium in 1986 .
Pavard 's strike was later voted as goal of the tournament .

The teams had met in six previous games , most recently in a friendly in 2017 , which ended in a 3–3 draw .
Playing as the Soviet Union , the teams had faced each other five times .
Russia has only had one victory over Spain .
In the 12th minute , Isco 's free - kick from deep on the right saw Sergei Ignashevich grappling with Sergio Ramos at the back post , the ball bouncing past Igor Akinfeev off the defender 's heel .
Russia were then awarded a penalty when Gerard Piqué handled in the box after a corner from the right .
Artem Dzyuba shot home to the right of the net from 12 yards to send the sides into half - time level .
In the 85th minute , Akinfeev got down low to his right to save a shot from Andrés Iniesta , the goalkeeper then denied Iago Aspas on the rebound .
Piqué and Ramos both appeared to be held from a set - piece but , after a VAR check , the referee waved away Spain 's appeals .
In the penalties , Akinfeev kept out a Koke effort and saw Aspas ' effort diverted away by his leg to give Russia the win ; as all Russia 's penalty kicks ended up successful .
Spain have now lost three of their four World Cup penalty shootouts ( after losing to Belgium in 1986 , beating the Republic of Ireland in 2002 and losing to South Korea in 2002 ) , and still have never defeated a host nation at FIFA World Cup , after losing to Italy 0–1 in 1934 , Brazil 1–6 in 1950 , and South Korea after penalties in 2002 .
Russia have reached the quarter - final of the World Cup for the first time since the break - up of the Soviet Union .
Ignashevich became the oldest player to score an own goal at the World Cup , aged 38 years and 352 days .
The match marked the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup in which a fourth substitution was made during extra time , after Aleksandr Yerokhin of Russia entered the pitch in the 97th minute .

The teams had met in five matches , which includes two matches played in 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification , the first fixture ending in a 1–1 draw and the reverse fixture a 3–1 Denmark win .
In the first minute , a long throw into the Croatia penalty area by Jonas Knudsen , allowed a run to Thomas Delaney who touched the ball on to Mathias Jørgensen , who side - footed it into the net via deflections off goalkeeper Danijel Subašić and the post .
After three minutes , Šime Vrsaljko 's ball into the box reached Henrik Dalsgaard , whose clearance hit Andreas Christensen in the face and saw Mario Mandžukić tucking the ball between Kasper Schmeichel and the left post with a shot on the turn from six yards .
During extra time , Ante Rebić burst clear of the Denmark defence and was felled by Mathias Jørgensen when he was clean through on goal , only for Schmeichel to save Luka Modrić 's spot - kick by diving down to his left and clutching the ball to his chest .
In the shoot - out , Subašić tipped off Christian Eriksen 's penalty onto the post but Schmeichel saved from Milan Badelj to bring the sides level .
Lasse Schöne 's shot was saved by Subašić and
Josip Pivarić was denied by an acrobatic Schmeichel stop .
On the final spot kicks for both the teams , Nicolai Jørgensen took a shot from a staggered run - up which Subašić saved with his feet , before Ivan Rakitić slotted the ball into the bottom left corner of the net .
Croatia have qualified for their first World Cup quarter - final since 1998 .

BRAZIL VS MEXICO
Section::::Brazil vs Mexico .
The teams had met in 40 previous matches including two games at CONCACAF Gold Cup finals ( 1996 and 2003 , both won by Mexico ) , the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup Final ( won 4–3 by Mexico ) , and four times in the FIFA World Cup group stage , three won by Brazil and one ending in a draw ( 4–0 in 1950 , 5–0 in 1954 , 2–0 in 1962 and 0–0 in 2014 ) .
Hirving Lozano 's half - volley was well blocked by Miranda , while at the other end , Guillermo Ochoa saved Neymar 's drive from just outside the penalty area .
After 25 minutes , Neymar raced past Edson Álvarez in the area and forced Ochoa into a save with his left hand .
Gabriel Jesus went close in the 33rd minute , finding space in a crowded area and drilling in a left - footed strike that Ochoa palmed away .
In the 51st minute , Neymar 's back - heel on the edge of the area teed up Willian for a burst into the box and his scuffed cross from the left was slid into an empty net by Neymar from close range .
With two minutes remaining , Neymar powered through on the left and his low effort was diverted by Ochoa 's foot into the path of Roberto Firmino , who tapped the ball into an empty net from close range .
Since the introduction of the round of 16 in 1986 , Mexico have been eliminated at this stage of the World Cup seven times – more than twice as many as any other nation .
This was also Mexico 's fourth defeat on the hand of Brazil , and moreover , Mexico had never scored a single goal against Brazil in the FIFA World Cup .

In the 48th minute , Gaku Shibasaki slipped a pass through to Genki Haraguchi , who rifled a shot across Thibaut Courtois from the right which went into the left corner of the net .
After 4 minutes , Japan scored a second , Shinji Kagawa collecting a loose ball and feeding Takashi Inui , the midfielder working himself a yard of space before arrowing home from 25-yards into the bottom right corner of the net .
Jan Vertonghen 's looping header from the left eluded goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima and landed in the right corner of the net after a corner caused chaos in the Japan penalty area – and
five minutes later they were back on level terms .
Eden Hazard twisted and turned to create space on the left wing , his cross delivered for Marouane Fellaini to climb above his marker and crash in a downward header .
In the last minute of stoppage time , Courtois found Kevin De Bruyne with a long throw , who freed Thomas Meunier with a pass , Meunier squared a low cross from the right and , when Romelu Lukaku dummied the ball , substitute Nacer Chadli was on hand to complete the comeback for Belgium with a low finish .
Belgium are the first team to come from two or more goals down to win a World Cup knockout stage match within 90 minutes since Portugal beat North Korea in the 1966 quarter - final ( 3–0 down , 5–3 win ) ; and for the first time comeback from two goals down since West Germany 's comeback 3–2 victory over England at 1970 .
Japan scored six goals at Russia 2018 , their highest ever tally in a single World Cup tournament .
Belgium have reached the World Cup quarter - finals in successive tournaments for the first time .

BRAZIL VS BELGIUM
Section::::Brazil vs Belgium .
The teams had met in four previous matches .
Their most recent meeting came in a World Cup knockout stage match in 2002 , Brazil winning 2–0 to advance to the quarter - finals .
That match was also the only time the two sides had previously met in a World Cup .
Belgium scored from their first corner of the game in the 13th minute , Vincent Kompany flicked on Eden Hazard 's left - wing delivery but the decisive touch came from Fernandinho , who turned the ball past Alisson via his arm .
Belgium doubled their lead by breaking from a Brazil corner in the 31st minute , Kevin De Bruyne arrowed a right foot drive across Alisson and into the left corner of the net from the edge of the penalty area after Romelu Lukaku collected the ball , turned and embarked on a 40-yard run with a pass at the end to free De Bruyne .
Brazil 's third change yielded a goal three minutes and 14 seconds after his introduction , Renato Augusto gliding between two Belgium defenders to nod a flicked header past Thibaut Courtois from a Philippe Coutinho cross .
Coutinho 's first - time shot flew wide and
yet another Neymar penalty appeal was rejected , before he drew a fingertip save from Courtois in the 94th minute .
De Bruyne became the 100th player to score at Russia 2018 ( excluding own goals ) .
Belgium have reached the World Cup semi - finals for only the second time , losing out to eventual winners Argentina in 1986 .
Belgium 's victory was only their second ever against Brazil , and first since a 1963 friendly match in Brussels .
This was the first time in 30 matches in all competitions that Brazil had conceded more than once in a game , since a 2–2 draw with Paraguay in March 2016 .

SWEDEN VS
ENGLAND
Section::::Sweden vs England .
The teams had faced each other in 23 previous matches , including two times in the group stage of the World Cup , both matches ending in a draw ( 1–1 in 2002 and 2–2 in 2006 ) .
Their most recent meeting came in a friendly in 2012 , a 4–2 Sweden win .
England took the lead in the 30th minute , Ashley Young 's outswinging corner from the left found Harry Maguire , goalkeeper Robin Olsen and Ola Toivonen on the line were unable to stop the defender 's downward header .
Olsen did well with a strong hand to deny Raheem Sterling , who dallied with the rebound and allowed Andreas Granqvist to make a vital block .
Shortly after the restart , Jordan Pickford dived to his left to palm away a header from Marcus Berg , who climbed above Young at the back post .
In the 58th minute , another England set - piece caused chaos and , although Sweden initially cleared their lines when Jesse Lingard delivered a cross from the right to the back post , Dele Alli was there to double his side 's advantage with a header .
John Guidetti teed up strike partner Berg in the 71st minute , but Pickford tipped the effort over the crossbar .
Alli 's goal was England 's 11th at Russia 2018 , equalling the country 's record of most goals at a single World Cup set in 1966 .
Alli is the second youngest player to score for England at the World Cup ( 22 years and 87 days ) , behind only Michael Owen ( 18 years and 190 days against Romania in 1998 ) .
Maguire became the first player to score their first England goal in a World Cup knockout match since Rio Ferdinand in 2002 against Denmark .
Pickford made three saves in this match and became the youngest England goalkeeper to keep a clean sheet in a World Cup match ( 24 years and 122 days ) .
England qualified for their first World Cup semi - final since 1990 .

Section::::Russia vs Croatia .
The teams had faced each other in three previous matches .
Their most recent meeting came in a friendly in 2015 , a 3–1 Croatia win .
In the 31st minute , Denis Cheryshev came in from the left and , after a one - two with Artem Dzyuba , skipped away from Luka Modrić to curl a left foot effort beyond Danijel Subašić and into the left of the net .
Six minutes before half - time , Mario Mandžukić advanced down the left to set up the chance for Andrej Kramarić to head home the equaliser .
In the first period of extra time , Croatia took the lead as Domagoj Vida nodded down past Igor Akinfeev and into the right corner of the net after a corner from the right .
Mário Fernandes drew his team level , converting Alan Dzagoev 's free - kick with a glancing header to the left corner of the net after a free - kick from the right .
Penalties were required and while Fyodor Smolov 's Panenka attempt with the first effort was foiled by Subašić , parity was restored when Akinfeev got down to his left to keep out Mateo Kovačić 's second kick for Croatia .
After Fernandes ' failure , Modrić 's strike found the net , following touches off Akinfeev 's glove and the post .
The decisive penalty fell to Ivan Rakitić , who rolled the ball into the bottom - left corner to give Croatia the win .
Russia became the first country in World Cup history to contest two shoot - outs while hosting the event .
There were three headed goals in this match – the most in a World Cup match since Germany 8–0 Saudi Arabia in 2002 ( 5 headers ) .
Croatia are the second team to win two penalty shootouts at a single World Cup tournament – the other was Argentina in 1990 ( against Yugoslavia and Italy ) .
Croatia has qualified for the semifinal for the first time since 1998 ( their first World Cup tournament ) .

Paolo Valeri ( Italy ) SEMI - FINALS Section::::Semi - finals .
For the first time since 1966 , all multiple World Cup winners were eliminated before the semi - final stage .
This is only the second time that neither Brazil nor Germany were in the last four , the other being the inaugural 1930 tournament .
With Uruguay and Brazil eliminated in the quarter - finals , an all - European semi - final line up was completed for the fifth time ( after the 1934 , 1966 , 1982 , and 2006 tournaments ) .
This also ensured that a European side would win the World Cup for the fourth tournament in a row .
FRANCE VS BELGIUM
Section::::France vs Belgium .
The teams had faced each other in 73 previous matches , including two times in the World Cup , France winning both matches ( 3–1 in the round of 16 in 1938 and 4–2 in the third place play - off in 1986 ) .
Their most recent meeting came in a friendly in 2015 , a 4–3 Belgium win .
Eden Hazard twice went close , narrowly missing the target with a low , left - footed drive before seeing a curler with his right deflected over the crossbar by the head of Raphaël Varane .
Hugo Lloris ' full - length dive kept out a first - time strike on the turn from Toby Alderweireld , while Thibaut Courtois blocked Benjamin Pavard 's attempt from a tight angle on the right at the other end .
Six minutes after the break , Vincent Kompany 's block turned away Olivier Giroud 's shot , and Antoine Griezmann 's inswinging delivery from the right to the front post was turned in by Samuel Umtiti , who outjumped his marker , Marouane Fellaini , to head beyond Courtois .
Dries Mertens 's cross from the right flank saw Fellaini narrowly miss the target with a header .
Axel Witsel 's long - range drive was pushed away by Lloris as France secured their place into the finals .
Didier Deschamps has now managed more games for France at the World Cup than any other previous France manager , overtaking Raymond Domenech and Michel Hidalgo after this match .
This was Belgium 's first defeat of any kind since a friendly loss against Spain in September 2016 .
France have reached their third World Cup final , also doing so in 1998 and 2006 .
Only Germany ( 8) and Italy ( 6 ) have reached more among European nations .

The teams had faced each other in seven previous matches , which includes two matches played in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification , England winning on both occasions ( 4–1 and 5–1 ) .
Luka Modrić stopped a Dele Alli run , by fouling him at the edge of the area .

After half - time , Ivan Perišić met Šime Vrsaljko 's deep cross from the right with a flying left - footed finish to the left of the net .
Soon after , Perišić shot against the right - hand post from the left before Ante Rebić put the rebound into Jordan Pickford 's hands .
In extra - time , John Stones had a header cleared off the line by Vrsaljko in the 98th minute .
Pickford at the other end , denied Mario Mandžukić at point - blank range after the striker met Perišić 's cross from the left .
But Mandžukić came out on top soon after the break , latching on to Perišić 's headed pass on the left and sending a left - footed effort across Pickford to find the bottom - right corner , securing Croatia 's entrance into their first ever World Cup final .
Croatia are the first team to avoid defeat after trailing in three knockout matches at a single World Cup .
They become the 13th different nation to reach their first World Cup Final .
Trippier became the first player to score a direct free - kick for England at the World Cup since David Beckham in 2006 against Ecuador .
Trippier 's goal after four minutes and 44 seconds was the fastest goal scored in a World Cup semi - final since 1958 ( Vavá after two minutes for Brazil v France ) .
Croatia became the first team to play extra time in three consecutive World Cup matches since England in 1990 .
England scored nine goals from set - pieces at the 2018 World Cup – the most by a team in a single World Cup tournament since 1966 .
