EFFECTS OF HIGH ALTITUDE ON HUMANS
The effects of high altitude on humans are considerable .
The percentage oxygen saturation of hemoglobin determines the content of oxygen in blood .
After the human body reaches around 2,100 m ( 7,000 feet ) above sea level , the saturation of oxyhemoglobin begins to decrease rapidly .
However , the human body has both short - term and long - term adaptations to altitude that allow it to partially compensate for the lack of oxygen .
There is a limit to the level of adaptation ; mountaineers refer to the altitudes above as the " death zone " , where it is generally believed that no human body can acclimatize .
EFFECTS
AS A FUNCTION OF ALTITUDE Section::::Effects as a function of altitude .
The human body can perform best at sea level , where the atmospheric pressure is 101,325 Pa or 1013.25 millibars ( or 1 atm , by definition ) .
The concentration of oxygen ( O ) in sea - level air is 20.9 % , so the partial pressure of O ( pO ) is 21.136 kPa .
In healthy individuals , this saturates hemoglobin , the oxygen - binding red pigment in red blood cells .
Atmospheric pressure decreases exponentially with altitude while the O fraction remains constant to about 100 km , so pO decreases exponentially with altitude as well .
It is about half of its sea - level value at , the altitude of the Everest Base Camp , and only a third at , the summit of Mount Everest .
When pO drops , the body responds with altitude acclimatization .
Mountain medicine recognizes three altitude regions that reflect the lowered amount of oxygen in the atmosphere : * High altitude = * Very high altitude = * Extreme altitude = above Travel to each of these altitude regions can lead to medical problems , from the mild symptoms of acute mountain sickness to the potentially fatal high - altitude pulmonary edema ( HAPE ) and high - altitude cerebral edema ( HACE ) .
The higher the altitude , the greater the risk .
Research also indicates elevated risk of permanent brain damage in people climbing to extreme altitudes .
Expedition doctors commonly stock a supply of dexamethasone , or " dex , " to treat these conditions on site .
Humans have survived for two years at , 475 millibars of atmospheric pressure ) , which is the highest recorded permanently tolerable altitude ; the highest permanent settlement known , La Rinconada , is at .
At extreme altitudes , above , 383 millibars of atmospheric pressure ) , sleeping becomes very difficult , digesting food is near - impossible , and the risk of HAPE or HACE increases greatly .
DEATH ZONE Section::::Death zone .
The death zone , in mountaineering , refers to altitudes above a certain point where the amount of oxygen is insufficient to sustain human life for an extended time span .
This point is generally tagged as , less than 356 millibars of atmospheric pressure ) .
All 14 summits in the death zone above 8000 m , called eight - thousanders , are located in the Himalaya and Karakoram mountain ranges .
The concept of the death zone ( originally the lethal zone ) was first conceived in 1953 by Edouard Wyss - Dunant , a Swiss doctor , in an article about acclimatization published in the journal of the Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research .
Many deaths in high - altitude mountaineering have been caused by the effects of the death zone , either directly ( loss of vital functions ) or indirectly ( wrong decisions made under stress , physical weakening leading to accidents ) .
In the death zone , the human body can not acclimatize .
An extended stay in the zone without supplementary oxygen will result in deterioration of bodily functions , loss of consciousness , and , ultimately , death .
Scientists at the High Altitude Pathology Institute in Bolivia dispute the existence of a death zone , based on observation of extreme tolerance to hypoxia in patients with chronic mountain sickness and normal fetuses in - utero , both of which present pO levels similar to those at the summit of Mount Everest .
LONG - TERM EFFECTS Section::::Long - term effects .
Studies have shown that the approximately 140 million people who live at elevations above have adapted to the lower oxygen levels .
These adaptations are especially pronounced in people living in the Andes and the Himalayas .
Compared with acclimatized newcomers , native Andean and Himalayan populations have better oxygenation at birth , enlarged lung volumes throughout life , and a higher capacity for exercise .
Tibetans demonstrate a sustained increase in cerebral blood flow , lower hemoglobin concentration , and less susceptibility to chronic mountain sickness ( CMS ) .
These adaptations may reflect the longer history of high altitude habitation in these regions .
A significantly lower mortality rate from cardiovascular disease is observed for residents at higher altitudes .
Similarly , a dose response relationship exists between increasing elevation and decreasing obesity prevalence in the United States .
This is not explained by migration alone .
On the other hand , people living at higher elevations also have a higher rate of suicide in the United States .
The correlation between elevation and suicide risk was present even when the researchers control for known suicide risk factors , including age , gender , race , and income .
Research has also indicated that oxygen levels are unlikely to be a factor , considering that there is no indication of increased mood disturbances at high altitude in those with sleep apnea or in heavy smokers at high altitude .
The cause for the increased suicide risk is as yet unknown .
ACCLIMATIZATION TO ALTITUDE Section::::Acclimatization to altitude .
The human body can adapt to high altitude through both immediate and long - term acclimatization .
At high altitude , in the short term , the lack of oxygen is sensed by the carotid bodies , which causes an increase in the breathing depth and rate ( hyperpnea ) .
However , hyperpnea also causes the adverse effect of respiratory alkalosis , inhibiting the respiratory center from enhancing the respiratory rate as much as would be required .
Inability to increase the breathing rate can be caused by inadequate carotid body response or pulmonary or renal disease .
In addition , at high altitude , the heart beats faster ; the stroke volume is slightly decreased ; and non - essential bodily functions are suppressed , resulting in a decline in food digestion efficiency ( as the body suppresses the digestive system in favor of increasing its cardiopulmonary reserves ) .
Full acclimatization , however , requires days or even weeks .
Gradually , the body compensates for the respiratory alkalosis by renal excretion of bicarbonate , allowing adequate respiration to provide oxygen without risking alkalosis .
It takes about four days at any given altitude and can be enhanced by drugs such as acetazolamide .
Eventually , the body undergoes physiological changes such as lower lactate production ( because reduced glucose breakdown decreases the amount of lactate formed ) , decreased plasma volume , increased hematocrit ( polycythemia ) , increased RBC mass , a higher concentration of capillaries in skeletal muscle tissue , increased myoglobin , increased mitochondria , increased aerobic enzyme concentration , increase in 2,3-BPG , hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction , and right ventricular hypertrophy .
Pulmonary artery pressure increases in an effort to oxygenate more blood .
Full hematological adaptation to high altitude is achieved when the increase of red blood cells reaches a plateau and stops .
The length of full hematological adaptation can be approximated by multiplying the altitude in kilometres by 11.4 days .
For example , to adapt to of altitude would require 45.6 days .
The upper altitude limit of this linear relationship has not been fully established .
Even when acclimatized , prolonged exposure to high altitude can interfere with pregnancy and cause intrauterine growth restriction or pre - eclampsia .
High altitude causes decreased blood flow to the placenta , even in acclimatized women , which interferes with fetal growth .
ALTITUDE AND ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE Section::::Altitude and athletic performance .
For athletes , high altitude produces two contradictory effects on performance .
For explosive events ( sprints up to 400 metres , long jump , triple jump )
the reduction in atmospheric pressure means there is less resistance from the atmosphere and the athlete 's performance will generally be better at high altitude .
For endurance events ( races of 800 metres or more ) , the predominant effect is the reduction in oxygen , which generally reduces the athlete 's performance at high altitude .
Sports organizations acknowledge the effects of altitude on performance : the International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) , for example , have ruled that performances achieved at an altitude greater than 1,000 metres will be approved for record purposes , but carry the notation of " A " to denote they were set at altitude .
The 1968 Summer Olympics were held at altitude in Mexico City .
With the best athletes in the world competing for the most prestigious title , most short sprint and jump records were set there at altitude .
Other records were also set at altitude in anticipation of those Olympics .
Bob Beamon 's record in the long jump held for almost 23 years and has only been beaten once without altitude or wind assistance .
Many of the other records set at Mexico City were later surpassed by marks set at altitude .
Athletes can also take advantage of altitude acclimatization to increase their performance .
The same changes that help the body cope with high altitude increase performance back at sea level .
However , this may not always be the case .
Any positive acclimatization effects may be negated by a de - training effect as the athletes are usually not able to exercise with as much intensity at high altitudes compared to sea level .
This conundrum led to the development of the altitude training modality known as " Live - High , Train - Low " , whereby the athlete spends many hours a day resting and sleeping at one ( high ) altitude , but performs a significant portion of their training , possibly all of it , at another ( lower ) altitude .
A series of studies conducted in Utah in the late 1990s by researchers Ben Levine , Jim Stray - Gundersen , and others , showed significant performance gains in athletes who followed such a protocol for several weeks .
Other studies have shown performance gains from merely performing some exercising sessions at high altitude , yet living at sea level .
The performance - enhancing effect of altitude training could be due to increased red blood cell count , more efficient training , or changes in muscle physiology .
