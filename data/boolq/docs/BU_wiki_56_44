SECOND
- LANGUAGE ACQUISITION
Second - language acquisition ( SLA ) , second - language learning , or L2 ( language 2 ) acquisition , is the process by which people learn a second language .
Second - language acquisition is also the scientific discipline devoted to studying that process .
The field of second - language acquisition is a subdiscipline of applied linguistics , but also receives research attention from a variety of other disciplines , such as psychology and education .
A central theme in SLA research is that of interlanguage , the idea that the language that learners use is not simply the result of differences between the languages that they already know and the language that they are learning , but that it is a complete language system in its own right , with its own systematic rules .
This interlanguage gradually develops as learners are exposed to the targeted language .
The order in which learners acquire features of their new language stays remarkably constant , even for learners with different native languages , and regardless of whether they have had language instruction .
However , languages that learners already know can have a significant influence on the process of learning a new one .
This influence is known as language transfer .
The primary factor driving SLA appears to be the language input that learners receive .
Learners become more advanced the longer they are immersed in the language they are learning , and the more time they spend doing free voluntary reading .
The input hypothesis developed by linguist Stephen Krashen makes a distinction between language acquisition and language learning ( acquisition â€“ learning distinction ) , claiming that acquisition is a subconscious process , whereas learning is a conscious one .
According to this hypothesis , the acquisition process in L2 ( Language 2 ) is the same as L1 ( Language 1 ) acquisition .
The learning process is consciously learning and inputting the language being learned .
However , this goes as far as to state that input is all that is required for acquisition .
Subsequent work , such as the interaction hypothesis and the comprehensible output hypothesis , has suggested that opportunities for output and for interaction may also be necessary for learners to reach more advanced levels .
Research on how exactly learners acquire a new language spans a number of different areas .
Focus is directed toward providing proof of whether basic linguistic skills are innate ( nature ) , acquired ( nurture ) , or a combination of the two attributes .
Cognitive approaches to SLA research deal with the processes in the brain that underpin language acquisition , for example how paying attention to language affects the ability to learn it , or how language acquisition is related to short - term and long - term memory .
Sociocultural approaches reject the notion that SLA is a purely psychological phenomenon , and attempt to explain it in a social context .
Some key social factors that influence SLA are the level of immersion , connection to the L2 community , and gender .
Linguistic approaches consider language separately from other kinds of knowledge , and attempt to use findings from the wider study of linguistics to explain SLA .
There is also a considerable body of research about how SLA can be affected by individual factors such as age and learning strategies .
A commonly discussed topic regarding age in SLA is the critical period hypothesis , which suggests that individuals lose the ability to fully learn a language after a particular age in childhood .
Another topic of interest in SLA is the differences between adult and child learners .
Learning strategies are commonly categorized as learning or communicative strategies , and are developed to improve their respective acquisition skills .
Affective factors are emotional factors that influence an individual 's ability to learn a new language .
Common affective factors that influence acquisition are anxiety , personality , social attitudes , and motivation .
Individuals may also lose a language through a process called second - language attrition .
This is often caused by lack of use or exposure to a language over time .
The severity of attrition depends on a variety of factors including level of proficiency , age , social factors , and motivation at the time of acquisition .
Finally , classroom research deals with the effect that language instruction has on acquisition . DEFINITIONS Section::::Definitions .
Second language refers to any language learned in addition to a person 's first language ; although the concept is named second - language acquisition , it can also incorporate the learning of third , fourth , or subsequent languages .
Second - language acquisition refers to what learners do ; it does not refer to practices in language teaching , although teaching can affect acquisition .
The term acquisition was originally used to emphasize the non - conscious nature of the learning process , but in recent years learning and acquisition have become largely synonymous .
SLA can incorporate heritage language learning , but it does not usually incorporate bilingualism .
Most SLA researchers see bilingualism as being the end result of learning a language , not the process itself , and see the term as referring to native - like fluency .
Writers in fields such as education and psychology , however , often use bilingualism loosely to refer to all forms of multilingualism .
SLA is also not to be contrasted with the acquisition of a foreign language ; rather , the learning of second languages and the learning of foreign languages involve the same fundamental processes in different situations .
RESEARCH BACKGROUND Section::::Research background .
The academic discipline of second - language acquisition is a subdiscipline of applied linguistics .
It is broad - based and relatively new .
As well as the various branches of linguistics , second - language acquisition is also closely related to psychology , cognitive psychology , and education .
To separate the academic discipline from the learning process itself , the terms second - language acquisition research , second - language studies , and second - language acquisition studies are also used .
SLA research began as an interdisciplinary field , and because of this it is difficult to identify a precise starting date .
However , two papers in particular are seen as instrumental to the development of the modern study of SLA :
Pit Corder 's 1967 essay
The Significance of Learners ' Errors , and Larry Selinker 's 1972 article Interlanguage .
The field saw a great deal of development in the following decades .
Since the 1980s , SLA has been studied from a variety of disciplinary perspectives , and theoretical perspectives .
In the early 2000s , some research suggested an equivalence between the acquisition of human languages and that of computer languages ( e.g. Java ) by children in the 5 to 11 year age window , though this has not been widely accepted among educators .
Significant approaches in the field today are : systemic functional linguistics , sociocultural theory , cognitive linguistics , Noam Chomsky 's universal grammar , skill acquisition theory and connectionism .
There has been much debate about exactly how language is learned , and many issues are still unresolved .
There are many theories of second - language acquisition , but none are accepted as a complete explanation by all SLA researchers .
Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field of SLA , this is not expected to happen in the foreseeable future .
Although attempts have been made to provide a more unified account that tries to bridge first language acquisition and second language learning research .
STAGES
Section::::Stages .
Stephen Krashen divides the process of second - language acquisition into five stages : preproduction , early production , speech emergence , intermediate fluency , and advanced fluency .
The first stage , preproduction , is also known as the silent period .
Learners at this stage have a receptive vocabulary of up to 500 words , but they do not yet speak their second language .
Not all learners go through a silent period .
Some learners start speaking straight away , although their output may consist of imitation rather than creative language use .
Others may be required to speak from the start as part of a language course .
For learners that do go through a silent period , it may last around three to six months .
The second of Krashen 's stages of acquisition is early production , during which learners are able to speak in short phrases of one or two words .
They can also memorize chunks of language , although they may make mistakes when using them .
Learners typically have both an active and receptive vocabulary of around 1000 words .
This stage normally lasts for around six months .
The third stage is speech emergence .
Learners ' vocabularies increase to around 3000 words during this stage , and they can communicate using simple questions and phrases .
They may often make grammatical errors .
The fourth stage is intermediate fluency .
At this stage , learners have a vocabulary of around 6000 words , and can use more complicated sentence structures .
They are also able to share their thoughts and opinions .
Learners may make frequent errors with more complicated sentence structures .
The final stage is advanced fluency , which is typically reached somewhere between five and ten years of learning the language .
Learners at this stage can function at a level close to native speakers .
Krashen has also developed a number of hypotheses discussing the nature of second language learners ' thought processes and the development of self - awareness during second language acquisition .
The most prominent of these hypotheses are Monitor Theory and the Affective Filter hypothesis .
The time taken to reach a high level of proficiency can vary depending on the language learned .
In the case of native English speakers , some estimates were provided by the Foreign Service Institute ( FSI ) of the U.S. Department of State , which compiled approximate learning expectations for a number of languages for their professional staff ( native English speakers who generally already know other languages ) .
Of the 63 languages analyzed , the five most difficult languages to reach proficiency in speaking and reading , requiring 88 weeks ( 2200 class hours ) , are Arabic , Cantonese , Mandarin , Japanese , and Korean .
The Foreign Service Institute and the National Virtual Translation Center
both note that Japanese is typically more difficult to learn than other languages in this group .
COMPARISONS WITH FIRST - LANGUAGE ACQUISITION Section::::Comparisons with first - language acquisition .
Adults who learn a second language differ from children learning their first language in at least three ways : children are still developing their brains whereas adults have mature minds , and adults have at least a first language that orients their thinking and speaking .
Although some adult second - language learners reach very high levels of proficiency , pronunciation tends to be non - native .
This lack of native pronunciation in adult learners is explained by the critical period hypothesis .
When a learner 's speech plateaus , it is known as fossilization .
Some errors that second - language learners make in their speech originate in their first language .
For example , Spanish speakers learning English may say " Is raining " rather than " It is raining " , leaving out the subject of the sentence .
This kind of influence of the first language on the second is known as negative language transfer .
French speakers learning English , however , do not usually make the same mistake of leaving out " it " in " It is raining .
"
This is because pronominal and impersonal sentence subjects can be omitted ( or as in this case , are not used in the first place ) in Spanish but not in French .
The French speaker knowing to use a pronominal sentence subject when speaking English is an example of positive language transfer .
It is important to note that not all errors occur in the same ways ; even two individuals with the same native language learning the same second language still have the potential to utilize different parts of their native language .
Likewise , these same two individuals may develop near - native fluency in different forms of grammar .
Also , when people learn a second language , the way they speak their first language changes in subtle ways .
These changes can be with any aspect of language , from pronunciation and syntax to the gestures the learner makes and the language features they tend to notice .
For example , French speakers who spoke English as a second language pronounced the /t/ sound in French differently from monolingual French speakers .
This kind of change in pronunciation has been found even at the onset of second - language acquisition ; for example , English speakers pronounced the English /p t k/ sounds , as well as English vowels , differently after they began to learn Korean .
These effects of the second language on the first led Vivian Cook to propose the idea of multi - competence , which sees the different languages a person speaks not as separate systems , but as related systems in their mind .
LEARNER LANGUAGE Section::::Learner language .
Learner language is the written or spoken language produced by a learner .
It is also the main type of data used in second - language acquisition research .
Much research in second - language acquisition is concerned with the internal representations of a language in the mind of the learner , and in how those representations change over time .
It is not yet possible to inspect these representations directly with brain scans or similar techniques , so SLA researchers are forced to make inferences about these rules from learners ' speech or writing .
INTERLANGUAGE Section::::Interlanguage .
Originally , attempts to describe learner language were based on comparing different languages and on analyzing learners ' errors .
However , these approaches were n't able to predict all the errors that learners made when in the process of learning a second language .
For example , Serbo - Croat speakers learning English may say " What does Pat doing now ? " , although this is not a valid sentence in either language .
To explain this kind of systematic error , the idea of the interlanguage was developed .
An interlanguage is an emerging language system in the mind of a second - language learner .
A learner 's interlanguage is not a deficient version of the language being learned filled with random errors , nor is it a language purely based on errors introduced from the learner 's first language .
Rather , it is a language in its own right , with its own systematic rules .
It is possible to view most aspects of language from an interlanguage perspective , including grammar , phonology , lexicon , and pragmatics .
There are three different processes that influence the creation of interlanguages : * Language transfer .
Learners fall back on their mother tongue to help create their language system .
Transfer can be positive , i.e. promote learning , or negative , i.e. lead to mistakes .
In the latter case , linguists also use the term interference error .
* Overgeneralization .
Learners use rules from the second language in roughly the same way that children overgeneralise in their first language .
For example , a learner may say " I goed home " , overgeneralizing the English rule of adding -ed to create past tense verb forms .
English children also produce forms like goed , sticked , bringed .
German children equally overextend regular past tense forms to irregular forms .
* Simplification .
Learners use a highly simplified form of language , similar to speech by children or in pidgins .
This may be related to linguistic universals .
The concept of interlanguage has become very widespread in SLA research , and is often a basic assumption made by researchers .
SEQUENCES OF ACQUISITION Section::::Sequences of acquisition .
1 .
In the 1970s , several studies investigated the order in which learners acquired different grammatical structures .
These studies showed that there was little change in this order among learners with different first languages .
Furthermore , it showed that the order was the same for adults and children , and that it did not even change if the learner had language lessons .
This supported the idea that there were factors other than language transfer involved in learning second languages , and was a strong confirmation of the concept of interlanguage .
However , the studies did not find that the orders were exactly the same .
Although there were remarkable similarities in the order in which all learners learned second - language grammar , there were still some differences among individuals and among learners with different first languages .
It is also difficult to tell when exactly a grammatical structure has been learned , as learners may use structures correctly in some situations but not in others .
Thus it is more accurate to speak of sequences of acquisition , in which specific grammatical features in a language are acquired before or after certain others but the overall order of acquisition is less rigid .
For example , if neither feature B nor feature D can be acquired until feature A has been acquired and if feature C can not be acquired until feature B has been acquired but if the acquisition of feature D does not require the possession of feature B ( or , therefore , of feature C ) , then both acquisition order ( A , B , C , D ) and acquisition order ( A , D , B , C ) are possible .
VARIABILITY Section::::Variability .
Although second - language acquisition proceeds in discrete sequences , it does not progress from one step of a sequence to the next in an orderly fashion .
There can be considerable variability in features of learners ' interlanguage while progressing from one stage to the next .
For example , in one study by Rod Ellis a learner used both " No look my card " and " Do n't look my card " while playing a game of bingo .
A small fraction of variation in interlanguage is free variation , when the learner uses two forms interchangeably .
However , most variation is systemic variation , variation that depends on the context of utterances the learner makes .
Forms can vary depending on linguistic context , such as whether the subject of a sentence is a pronoun or a noun ; they can vary depending on social context , such as using formal expressions with superiors and informal expressions with friends ; and also , they can vary depending on psycholinguistic context , or in other words , on whether learners have the chance to plan what they are going to say .
The causes of variability are a matter of great debate among SLA researchers .
LANGUAGE TRANSFER Section::::Language transfer .
One important difference between first - language acquisition and second - language acquisition is that the process of second - language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows .
This influence is known as language transfer .
Language transfer is a complex phenomenon resulting from interaction between learners ' prior linguistic knowledge , the target - language input they encounter , and their cognitive processes .
Language transfer is not always from the learner 's native language ; it can also be from a second language , or a third .
Neither is it limited to any particular domain of language ; language transfer can occur in grammar , pronunciation , vocabulary , discourse , and reading .
Language transfer often occurs when learners sense a similarity between a feature of a language they already know and a feature of the interlanguage they have developed .
If this happens , the acquisition of more complicated language forms may be delayed in favor of simpler language forms that resemble those of the language the learner is familiar with .
Learners may also decline to use some language forms at all if they are perceived as being too distant from their first language .
Language transfer has been the subject of several studies , and many aspects of it remain unexplained .
Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain language transfer , but there is no single widely accepted explanation of why it occurs .
INPUT AND INTERACTION Section::::Input and interaction .
The primary factor affecting language acquisition appears to be the input that the learner receives .
Stephen Krashen took a very strong position on the importance of input , asserting that comprehensible input is all that is necessary for second - language acquisition .
Krashen pointed to studies showing that the length of time a person stays in a foreign country is closely linked with his level of language acquisition .
Further evidence for input comes from studies on reading : large amounts of free voluntary reading have a significant positive effect on learners ' vocabulary , grammar , and writing .
Input is also the mechanism by which people learn languages according to the universal grammar model .
The type of input may also be important .
One tenet of Krashen 's theory is that input should not be grammatically sequenced .
He claims that such sequencing , as found in language classrooms where lessons involve practicing a " structure of the day " , is not necessary , and may even be harmful .
While input is of vital importance , Krashen 's assertion that only input matters in second - language acquisition has been contradicted by more recent research .
For example , students enrolled in French - language immersion programs in Canada still produced non - native - like grammar when they spoke , even though they had years of meaning - focused lessons and their listening skills were statistically native - level .
Output appears to play an important role , and among other things , can help provide learners with feedback , make them concentrate on the form of what they are saying , and help them to automatize their language knowledge .
These processes have been codified in the theory of comprehensible output .
Researchers have also pointed to interaction in the second language as being important for acquisition .
According to Long 's interaction hypothesis the conditions for acquisition are especially good when interacting in the second language ; specifically , conditions are good when a breakdown in communication occurs and learners must negotiate for meaning .
The modifications to speech arising from interactions like this help make input more comprehensible , provide feedback to the learner , and push learners to modify their speech .
COGNITIVE FACTORS Section::::Cognitive factors .
Much modern research in second - language acquisition has taken a cognitive approach .
Cognitive research is concerned with the mental processes involved in language acquisition , and how they can explain the nature of learners ' language knowledge .
This area of research is based in the more general area of cognitive science , and uses many concepts and models used in more general cognitive theories of learning .
As such , cognitive theories view second - language acquisition as a special case of more general learning mechanisms in the brain .
This puts them in direct contrast with linguistic theories , which posit that language acquisition uses a unique process different from other types of learning .
The dominant model in cognitive approaches to second - language acquisition , and indeed in all second - language acquisition research , is the computational model .
The computational model involves three stages .
In the first stage , learners retain certain features of the language input in short - term memory .
( This retained input is known as intake . )
Then , learners convert some of this intake into second - language knowledge , which is stored in long - term memory .
Finally , learners use this second - language knowledge to produce spoken output .
Cognitive theories attempt to codify both the nature of the mental representations of intake and language knowledge , and the mental processes that underlie these stages .
In the early days of second - language acquisition research on interlanguage was seen as the basic representation of second - language knowledge ; however , more recent research has taken a number of different approaches in characterizing the mental representation of language knowledge .
There are theories that hypothesize that learner language is inherently variable , and there is the functionalist perspective that sees acquisition of language as intimately tied to the function it provides .
Some researchers make the distinction between implicit and explicit language knowledge , and some between declarative and procedural language knowledge .
There have also been approaches that argue for a dual - mode system in which some language knowledge is stored as rules , and other language knowledge as items .
The mental processes that underlie second - language acquisition can be broken down into micro - processes and macro - processes .
Micro - processes include attention ; working memory ; integration and restructuring .
Restructuring is the process by which learners change their interlanguage systems ; and monitoring is the conscious attending of learners to their own language output .
Macro - processes include the distinction between intentional learning and incidental learning ; and also the distinction between explicit and implicit learning .
Some of the notable cognitive theories of second - language acquisition include the nativization model , the multidimensional model and processability theory , emergentist models , the competition model , and skill - acquisition theories .
Other cognitive approaches have looked at learners ' speech production , particularly learners ' speech planning and communication strategies .
Speech planning can have an effect on learners ' spoken output , and research in this area has focused on how planning affects three aspects of speech : complexity , accuracy , and fluency .
Of these three , planning effects on fluency has had the most research attention .
Communication strategies are conscious strategies that learners employ to get around any instances of communication breakdown they may experience .
Their effect on second - language acquisition is unclear , with some researchers claiming they help it , and others claiming the opposite .
SOCIOCULTURAL FACTORS
Section::::Sociocultural factors .
From the early days of the discipline researchers have also acknowledged that social aspects play an important role .
There have been many different approaches to sociolinguistic study of second - language acquisition , and indeed , according to Rod Ellis , this plurality has meant that " sociolinguistic SLA is replete with a bewildering set of terms referring to the social aspects of L2 acquisition " .
Common to each of these approaches , however , is a rejection of language as a purely psychological phenomenon ; instead , sociolinguistic research views the social context in which language is learned as essential for a proper understanding of the acquisition process .
Ellis identifies three types of social structure that affect acquisition of second languages : sociolinguistic setting , specific social factors , and situational factors .
Sociolinguistic setting refers to the role of the second language in society , such as whether it is spoken by a majority or a minority of the population , whether its use is widespread or restricted to a few functional roles , or whether the society is predominantly bilingual or monolingual .
Ellis also includes the distinction of whether the second language is learned in a natural or an educational setting .
Specific social factors that can affect second - language acquisition include age , gender , social class , and ethnic identity , with ethnic identity being the one that has received most research attention .
Situational factors are those that vary between each social interaction .
For example , a learner may use more polite language when talking to someone of higher social status , but more informal language when talking with friends .
Immersion programs provide a sociolinguistic setting that facilitates second - language acquisition .
Immersion programs are educational programs where children are instructed in an L2 language .
Although the language of instruction is the L2 language , the curriculum parallels that of non - immersion programs and clear support exists in the L1 language , as the teachers are all bilingual .
The goal of these programs is to develop a high level of proficiency in both the L1 and L2 languages .
Students in immersion programs have been shown to have greater levels of proficiency in their second language than students who receive second language education only as a subject in school .
This is especially true in terms of their receptive skills .
Also , students who join immersion programs earlier generally have greater second - language proficiency than their peers who join later .
However , students who join later have been shown to gain native - like proficiency .
Although immersion students ' receptive skills are especially strong , their productive skills may suffer if they spend the majority of their time listening to instruction only .
Grammatical skills and the ability to have precise vocabulary are particular areas of struggle .
It is argued that immersion is necessary , but not sufficient for the development of native - like proficiency in a second language .
Opportunities to engage in sustained conversation , and assignments that encourage syntactical , as well as semantic development help develop the productive skills necessary for bilingual proficiency .
A learner 's sense of connection to their in - group , as well as to the community of the target language emphasize the influence of the sociolinguistic setting , as well as social factors within the second - language acquisition process .
Social Identity Theory argues that an important factor for second language acquisition is the learner 's perceived identity in relation to the community of the language being learned , as well as how the community of the target language perceives the learner .
Whether or not a learner feels a sense of connection to the community or culture of the target language helps determine their social distance from the target culture .
A smaller social distance is likely to encourage learners to acquire the second language , as their investment in the learning process is greater .
Conversely , a greater social distance discourages attempts to acquire the target language .
However , negative views not only come from the learner , but the community of the target language might feel greater social distance to the learner , limiting the learner 's ability to learn the language .
Whether or not bilingualism is valued by the culture or community of the learner is an important indicator for the motivation to learn a language .
Gender , as a social factor , also influences SLA .
Females have been found to have higher motivation and more positive attitudes than males for second - language acquisition .
However , females are also more likely to present higher levels of anxiety , which may inhibit their ability to efficiently learn a new language .
There have been several models developed to explain social effects on language acquisition .
Schumann 's Acculturation Model proposes that learners ' rate of development and ultimate level of language achievement is a function of the " social distance " and the " psychological distance " between learners and the second - language community .
In Schumann 's model the social factors are most important , but the degree to which learners are comfortable with learning the second language also plays a role .
Another sociolinguistic model is Gardner 's socio - educational model , which was designed to explain classroom language acquisition .
Gardner 's model focuses on the emotional aspects of SLA , arguing that positive motivation contributes to an individuals willingness to learn L2 ; furthermore , the goal of an individual to learn a L2 is based on the idea that the individual has a desire to be part of a culture , in other words , part of a ( the targeted language ) mono - linguistic community .
Factors , such as integrativeness and attitudes towards the learning situation drive motivation .
The outcome of positive motivation is not only linguistic , but non - linguistic , such that the learner has met the desired goal .
Although there are many critics of Gardner 's model , nonetheless many of these critics have been influenced by the merits that his model holds .
The inter - group model proposes " ethnolinguistic vitality " as a key construct for second - language acquisition .
Language socialization is an approach with the premise that " linguistic and cultural knowledge are constructed through each other " , and saw increased attention after the year 2000 .
Finally , Norton 's theory of social identity is an attempt to codify the relationship between power , identity , and language acquisition .
SOCIOCULTURAL APPROACHES
Section::::Sociocultural approaches .
A unique approach to SLA is Sociocultural theory .
It was originally developed by Lev Vygotsky and his followers .
Central to Vygotsky 's theory is the concept of a zone of proximal development ( ZPD ) .
The ZPD notion states that social interaction with more advanced target language users allows one to learn language at a higher level than if they were to learn language independently .
Sociocultural theory has a fundamentally different set of assumptions to approaches to second - language acquisition based on the computational model .
Furthermore , although it is closely affiliated with other social approaches , it is a theory of mind and not of general social explanations of language acquisition .
According to Ellis , " It is important to recognize ... that this paradigm , despite the label ' sociocultural ' does not seek to explain how learners acquire the cultural values of the L2 but rather how knowledge of an L2 is internalized through experiences of a sociocultural nature . "
LINGUISTIC FACTORS
Section::::Linguistic factors .
Linguistic approaches to explaining second - language acquisition spring from the wider study of linguistics .
They differ from cognitive approaches and sociocultural approaches in that they consider language knowledge to be unique and distinct from any other type of knowledge .
The linguistic research tradition in second - language acquisition has developed in relative isolation from the cognitive and sociocultural research traditions , and as of 2010 the influence from the wider field of linguistics was still strong .
Two main strands of research can be identified in the linguistic tradition : approaches informed by universal grammar , and typological approaches .
Typological universals are principles that hold for all the world 's languages .
They are found empirically , by surveying different languages and deducing which aspects of them could be universal ; these aspects are then checked against other languages to verify the findings .
The interlanguages of second - language learners have been shown to obey typological universals , and some researchers have suggested that typological universals may constrain interlanguage development .
The theory of universal grammar was proposed by Noam Chomsky in the 1950s , and has enjoyed considerable popularity in the field of linguistics .
It focuses on describing the linguistic competence of an individual .
He believed that children not only acquire language by learning descriptive rules of grammar ; he claimed that children creatively play and form words as they learn language , creating meaning of these words , as opposed to the mechanism of memorizing language .
It consists of a set of principles , which are universal and constant , and a set of parameters , which can be set differently for different languages .
The " universals " in universal grammar differ from typological universals in that they are a mental construct derived by researchers , whereas typological universals are readily verifiable by data from world languages .
It is widely accepted among researchers in the universal grammar framework that all first - language learners have access to universal grammar ; this is not the case for second - language learners , however , and much research in the context of second - language acquisition has focused on what level of access learners may have .
Universal grammar theory can account for some of the observations of SLA research .
For example , L2-users often display knowledge about their L2 that they have not been exposed to .
L2-users are often aware of ambiguous or ungrammatical L2 units that they have not learned from any external source , nor from their pre - existing L1 knowledge .
This unsourced knowledge suggests the existence of a universal grammar .
INDIVIDUAL VARIATION
Section::::Individual variation .
There is considerable variation in the rate at which people learn second languages , and in the language level that they ultimately reach .
Some learners learn quickly and reach a near - native level of competence , but others learn slowly and get stuck at relatively early stages of acquisition , despite living in the country where the language is spoken for several years .
The reason for this disparity was first addressed with the study of language learning aptitude in the 1950s , and later with the good language learner studies in the 1970s .
More recently research has focused on a number of different factors that affect individuals ' language learning , in particular strategy use , social and societal influences , personality , motivation , and anxiety .
The relationship between age and the ability to learn languages has also been a subject of long - standing debate .
AGE Section::::Age .
The issue of age was first addressed with the critical period hypothesis .
The strict version of this hypothesis states that there is a cut - off age at about 12 , after which learners lose the ability to fully learn a language .
However , the exact age marking the end of the critical period is debated , and ranges from age 6 to 13 , with many arguing that it is around the onset of puberty .
This strict version has since been rejected for second - language acquisition , as some adult learners have been observed who reach native - like levels of pronunciation and general fluency .
However , in general , adult learners of a second - language rarely achieve the native - like fluency that children display , despite often progressing faster in the initial stages .
This has led to speculation that age is indirectly related to other , more central factors that affect language learning .
Children who acquire two languages from birth are called simultaneous bilinguals .
In these cases , both languages are spoken to the children by their parents or caregivers and they grow up knowing the two languages .
These children generally reach linguistic milestones at the same time as their monolingual peers .
Children who do not learn two languages from infancy , but learn one language from birth , and another at some point during childhood , are referred to as sequential bilinguals .
People often assume that a sequential bilingual 's first language is their most proficient language , but this is not always the case .
Over time and experience , a child 's second language may become his or her strongest .
This is especially likely to happen if a child 's first language is a minority language spoken at home , and the child 's second language is the majority language learned at school or in the community before the age of five .
Proficiency for both simultaneous and sequential bilinguals is dependent upon the child 's opportunities to engage in meaningful conversations in a variety of contexts .
Often simultaneous bilinguals are more proficient in their languages than sequential bilinguals .
One argument for this is that simultaneous bilinguals develop more distinct representations of their languages , especially with regards to phonological and semantic levels of processing .
This would cause learners to have more differentiation between the languages , leading them to be able to recognize the subtle differences between the languages that less proficient learners would struggle to recognize .
Learning a language earlier in life would help develop these distinct representations of language , as the learner 's first language would be less established .
Conversely , learning a language later in life would lead to more similar semantic representations .
Although child learners more often acquire native - like proficiency , older child and adult learners often progress faster in the initial stages of learning .
Older child and adult learners are quicker at acquiring the initial grammar knowledge than child learners , however , with enough time and exposure to the language , children surpass their older peers .
Once surpassed , older learners often display clear language deficiencies compared to child learners .
This has been attributed to having a solid grasp on the first language or mother tongue they were first immersed into .
Having this cognitive ability already developed can aid the process of learning a second language since there is a better understanding of how language works .
For this same reason interaction with family and further development of the first language is encouraged along with positive reinforcement .
The exact language deficiencies that occur past a certain age are not unanimously agreed upon .
Some believe that only pronunciation is affected , while others believe other abilities are affected as well .
However , some differences that are generally agreed upon include older learners having a noticeable accent , a smaller vocabulary , and making several linguistic errors .
One explanation for this difference in proficiency between older learners and younger learners involves Universal Grammar .
Universal Grammar is a debated theory that suggests that people have innate knowledge of universal linguistic principles that is present from birth .
These principles guide children as they learn a language , but its parameters vary from language to language .
The theory assumes that , while Universal Grammar remains into adulthood , the ability to reset the parameters set for each language is lost , making it more difficult to learn a new language proficiently .
Since adults have an already established native language , the language acquisition process is much different for them , than young learners .
The rules and principles that guide the use of the learners ' native language plays a role in the way the second language is developed .
Some nonbiological explanations for second - language acquisition age differences include variations in social and psychological factors , such as motivation ; the learner 's linguistic environment ; and the level of exposure .
Even with less advantageous nonbiological influences , many child learners attain a greater level of proficiency than adult learners with more advantageous nonbiological influences .
STRATEGIES
Section::::Strategies .
Considerable attention has been paid to the strategies learners use to learn a second language .
Strategies have been found to be of critical importance , so much so that strategic competence has been suggested as a major component of communicative competence .
Strategies are commonly divided into learning strategies and communicative strategies , although there are other ways of categorizing them .
Learning strategies are techniques used to improve learning , such as mnemonics or using a dictionary .
Communicative strategies are strategies a learner uses to convey meaning even when he or she does n't have access to the correct form , such as using pro - forms like thing , or using non - verbal means such as gestures .
If learning strategies and communicative strategies are used properly language acquisition is successful .
Some points to keep in mind while learning an additional language are : providing information that is of interest to the student , offering opportunities for the student to share their knowledge and teaching appropriate techniques for the uses of the learning resources available .
Another strategy may include intentional ways to acquire or improve official their second language skills .
Adult immigrants and/or second language learners seeking to acquire a second language can engage in different activities to receive and share knowledge as well improve their learning ; some of these include : * incidental or informal learning ( media resources , family / friend interactions , work interactions ) * purposeful learning ( self - study , taking language classes ) * pursuing formal education
AFFECTIVE FACTORS Section::::Affective factors .
The learner 's attitude to the learning process has also been identified as being critically important to second - language acquisition .
Anxiety in language - learning situations has been almost unanimously shown to be detrimental to successful learning .
Anxiety interferes with the mental processing of language because the demands of anxiety - related thoughts create competition for mental resources .
This results in less available storage and energy for tasks required for language processing .
Not only this , but anxiety is also usually accompanied by self - deprecating thoughts and fear of failure , which can be detrimental to an individual 's ability to learn a new language .
Learning a new language provides a unique situation that may even produce a specific type of anxiety , called language anxiety , that affects the quality of acquisition .
Also , anxiety may be detrimental for SLA because it can influence a learner 's ability to attend to , concentrate on , and encode language information .
It may affect speed and accuracy of learning .
Further , the apprehension created as a result of anxiety inhibits the learner 's ability to retrieve and produce the correct information .
A related factor , personality , has also received attention .
There has been discussion about the effects of extravert and introvert personalities .
Extraverted qualities may help learners seek out opportunities and people to assist with L2 learning , whereas introverts may find it more difficult to seek out such opportunities for interaction .
However , it has also been suggested that , while extraverts might experience greater fluency , introverts are likely to make fewer linguistic errors .
Further , while extraversion might be beneficial through its encouragement of learning autonomously , it may also present challenges as learners may find reflective and time - management skills to be difficult .
However , one study has found that there were no significant differences between extraverts and introverts on the way they achieve success in a second language .
Other personality factors , such as conscientiousness , agreeableness , and openness influence self - regulation , which helps L2 learners engage , process meaning , and adapt their thoughts , feelings , and actions to benefit the acquisition process .
SLA research has shown conscientiousness to be associated with time - management skills , metacognition , analytic learning , and persistence ; agreeableness to effort ; and openness to elaborative learning , intelligence , and metacognition .
Both genetics and the learner 's environment impact the personality of the learner , either facilitating or hindering an individual 's ability to learn .
Social attitudes such as gender roles and community views toward language learning have also proven critical .
Language learning can be severely hampered by cultural attitudes , with a frequently cited example being the difficulty of Navajo children in learning English .
Also , the motivation of the individual learner is of vital importance to the success of language learning .
Motivation is influenced by goal salience , valence , and self - efficacy .
In this context , goal salience is the importance of the L2 learner 's goal , as well as how often the goal is pursued ; valence is the value the L2 learner places on SLA , determined by desire to learn and attitudes about learning the L2 ; and self - efficacy is the learner 's own belief that he or she is capable of achieving the linguistic goal .
Studies have consistently shown that intrinsic motivation , or a genuine interest in the language itself , is more effective over the long term than extrinsic motivation , as in learning a language for a reward such as high grades or praise .
However , motivation is dynamic and , as a L2 learner 's fluency develops , their extrinsic motivation may evolve to become more intrinsic .
Learner motivation can develop through contact with the L2 community and culture , as learners often desire to communicate and identify with individuals in the L2 community .
Further , a supportive learning environment facilitates motivation through the increase in self - confidence and autonomy .
Learners in a supportive environment are more often willing to take on challenging tasks , thus encouraging L2 development .
ATTRITION Section::::Attrition .
Attrition is the loss of proficiency in a language caused by a lack of exposure to or use of a language .
It is a natural part of the language experience as it exists within a dynamic environment .
As the environment changes , the language adapts .
One way it does this is by using L1 as a tool to navigate the periods of change associated with acquisition and attrition .
A learner 's L2 is not suddenly lost with disuse , but its communicative functions are slowly replaced by those of the L1 .
Similar to second - language acquisition , second - language attrition occurs in stages .
However , according to the regression hypothesis , the stages of attrition occur in reverse order of acquisition .
With acquisition , receptive skills develop first , and then productive skills , and with attrition , productive skills are lost first , and then receptive skills .
Age , proficiency level , and social factors play a role in the way attrition occurs .
Most often younger children are quicker than adults to lose their L2 when it is left unused .
However , if a child has established a high level of proficiency , it may take him or her several years to lose the language .
Proficiency level seems to play the largest role in the extent of attrition .
For very proficient individuals , there is a period of time where very little , if any , attrition is observed .
For some , residual learning might even occur , which is the apparent improvement within the L2 .
Within the first five years of language disuse , the total percentage of language knowledge lost is less for a proficient individual than for someone less proficient .
A cognitive psychological explanation for this suggests that a higher level of proficiency involves the use of schemas , or mental representations for linguistic structures .
Schemas involve deeper mental processes for mental retrieval that are resistant to attrition .
As a result , information that is tied to this system is less likely to experience less extreme attrition than information that is not .
Finally , social factors may play an indirect role in attrition .
In particular , motivation and attitude influence the process .
Higher levels of motivation , and a positive attitude toward the language and the corresponding community may lessen attrition .
This is likely due to the higher level of competence achieved in L2 when the learner is motivated and has a positive attitude .
CLASSROOM
SECOND - LANGUAGE ACQUISITION Section::::Classroom second - language acquisition .
While considerable SLA research has been devoted to language learning in a natural setting , there have also been efforts made to investigate second - language acquisition in the classroom .
This kind of research has a significant overlap with language education , and it is mainly concerned with the effect that instruction has on the learner .
It also explores what teachers do , the classroom context , the dynamics of classroom communication .
It is both qualitative and quantitative research .
The research has been wide - ranging .
There have been attempts made to systematically measure the effectiveness of language teaching practices for every level of language , from phonetics to pragmatics , and for almost every current teaching methodology .
This research has indicated that many traditional language - teaching techniques are extremely inefficient .
cited in It is generally agreed that pedagogy restricted to teaching grammar rules and vocabulary lists does not give students the ability to use the L2 with accuracy and fluency .
Rather , to become proficient in the second language , the learner must be given opportunities to use it for communicative purposes .
Another area of research has been on the effects of corrective feedback in assisting learners .
This has been shown to vary depending on the technique used to make the correction , and the overall focus of the classroom , whether on formal accuracy or on communication of meaningful content .
There is also considerable interest in supplementing published research with approaches that engage language teachers in action research on learner language in their own classrooms .
As teachers become aware of the features of learner language produced by their students , they can refine their pedagogical intervention to maximize interlanguage development .
