SUPER BOWL RING
The Super Bowl ring is an award in the National Football League given to the winners of the league 's annual championship game , the Super Bowl .
Since only one Vince Lombardi Trophy is awarded to the team ( ownership ) itself , the Super Bowl ring offers a collectable memento for the actual players and team members to keep for themselves to symbolise their victory .
DETAILS Section::::Details .
These rings are typically made of yellow or white gold with diamonds .
They usually include the team name , team logo , and Super Bowl number ( usually indicated in Roman numerals ) .
The NFL contributes up to $ 5,000 per ring for up to 150 rings for the winning team ; any additional costs are borne by the team .
Most rings are manufactured by memorabilia company Jostens .
In 2015 , the rings for the New England Patriots reportedly cost $ 36,500 each , making them the most expensive rings Jostens has ever produced .
The winning team can typically present rings to whomever they choose , including usually , but not limited to : players ( active roster or injured ) , coaches , trainers , executives , personnel , and general staff .
Some teams have given rings to former players and coaches that were on the team at some point during the season , despite not having been on the winning roster for the Super Bowl itself .
Sometimes a team will give rings to fans as part of a charity raffle .
Teams can distribute any number of rings .
A recent trend over the last 15–20 years has been lesser rings awarded to front office staff .
These are commonly called " B " and " C " level rings and are smaller and contain fewer diamonds or contain faux diamonds .
The first instance of this was the Redskins Super Bowl XVII ring when many in the front office received rings that were not solid gold and contained cubic zirconia stones ( which resemble diamonds ) .
When Tampa Bay won Super Bowl XXXVII , the players and coaches received rings with a diamond - centered Lombardi trophy .
Some staff received rings with a metal Lombardi trophy and real diamonds surrounding the trophy and the " C " level ring did not contain any diamonds .
Many rings feature diamonds in the shape of the Vince Lombardi Trophy or a football .
Some feature diamonds or gold in the shape of a team logo .
Others illustrate the number of Super Bowls that franchise has won .
Also , the rings are customized with the player 's name and uniform number .
The Green Bay Packers Super Bowl XLV ring contained more than 100 diamonds .
The Packer logo , in the center of the ring , made up 13 diamonds , one for each title the team has won , dating back to 1929 .
In a break from tradition , this is the first Super Bowl ring to be made of platinum , not gold .
The New England Patriots Super Bowl LI ring has 283 diamonds , to commemorate their comeback from being down 28 - 3 versus the Atlanta Falcons late in the 3rd quarter .
