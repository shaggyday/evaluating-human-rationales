GAMEPLAY Section::::Gameplay .
Ori and the Blind Forest is a 2D platform game .
The player controls Ori , a white guardian spirit of indeterminate gender , and Sein , who is the light and eyes of the Spirit Tree .
Ori can jump , climb , and use other abilities to navigate .
Sein can shoot Spirit Flames to combat enemies or break obstacles .
Ori is required to interact with their environment as they jump from platforms and solve puzzles .
Ori is faced with enemies while making their way to restoring the forest .
The player helps Ori collect health shards , energy shards , new abilities , and upgrades .
The game world unfolds to the player in the fashion of a Metroidvania , with new abilities allowing the player to access previously inaccessible areas .
In addition to save points scattered in the game , players can create " soul links " at any time they choose to serve as checkpoints .
However , soul links can only be created using energy cells collected during gameplay ; the needed energy is not in abundant supply , forcing players to create them only when necessary .
The player can gain ability points to buy various perks and upgrades , such as increasing the damage of Sein 's Spirit Flame .
These upgrades can be bought anywhere a soul link has been created and if the player has enough ability points to buy the skill they desire .
An ability point is gained when Ori collects enough experience by killing enemies and destroying various plants .
Each skill must be bought in sequential order from one of three ability trees to allow the next , more expensive skill to be accessible .
PLOT Section::::Plot .
The voice of the Spirit Tree in the forest of Nibel narrates the story of when Ori , a white guardian spirit , fell from the tree during a storm as a newborn and was adopted by a creature named Naru , who raised Ori as her own .
A cataclysmic event soon makes all of the forest wither , and Naru dies of starvation .
Newly orphaned , Ori was left to explore the forest on their own .
After collapsing near the Spirit Tree and being restored to life by it , Ori later meets Sein ( pronounced ) , a being in the shape of a small blue orb , who both guides Ori on their adventure and attacks enemies .
To restore the forest , Sein guides Ori to recover the light of three main elements supporting the balance of Nibel : Waters , Winds and Warmth .
Ori and Sein come across two beings in their quest : Gumo , the last survivor of the spider - like Gumon clan and whose home supports the Wind element ; and Kuro , a giant , shadowy owl who is hostile toward Ori .
Her hostility and the forest 's cataclysm are explained in flashbacks .
When Ori was lost , the Spirit Tree released a flash of light to look for them , which killed all of Kuro 's recently hatched offspring .
Determined to prevent this from happening to her yet unborn child , Kuro took away the core on top of the Spirit Tree , which is actually Sein .
Without the Spirit Tree 's support , the three elements can not be sustained , and Nibel lost its balance .
As the element of Wind is rekindled , Gumo , realizing what Ori and Sein intend to do , uses his clan treasure that stores the light from the Spirit Tree to revive Naru , and takes her to where Ori is .
After the final element , Warmth , is restored in the volcano Mount Horu , Kuro captures Ori and Sein as the fire from Horu starts to spread .
Naru , who had been separated from Gumo , arrives to protect Ori from Kuro .
Kuro softens , remembering the pain of losing her children .
As the fire spreads and is about to reach her remaining egg , Kuro takes Sein back to the Spirit Tree , which emits a flash of bright light that dissipates the fire and restores the forest , but Kuro is destroyed by the light .
Time passes as the forest begins to flourish once more , and Ori is shown sitting on a log watching new spirits being born in the field at the foot of the Spirit Tree .
Gumo and Naru watch together from afar , before the latter goes home , where Kuro 's last egg now rests , just in time to see it begin to hatch .
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Development .
Ori and the Blind Forest was developed by Moon Studios , a worldwide collaboration of designers and programmers who have been working on the game four years before it was released , with Microsoft acquiring the game about a year after development started .
One of the lead team members is Thomas Mahler , an artist formerly working with Blizzard Entertainment .
According to Microsoft producer Daniel Smith , Moon Studios is not located in any one location , but instead staffers can be found throughout the world , from Austria to Australia and Israel to the United States .
Gameplay programmer David Clark described the team as being inspired by current and classic adventure games , notably the Rayman and Metroid franchises , and that Ori is intended as a " love letter " to those games .
The designers say they were guided by works such as The Lion King and The Iron Giant and that it is a " coming - of - age story " .
The designers were also heavily influenced by the work of Hayao Miyazaki , particularly with one of the levels " Valley of the Wind " , being a nod to Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind .
The art style is meant to appear hand - drawn , similar to the more recent Rayman titles that utilize Ubisoft 's " UbiArt " graphics engine ; the game instead uses the Unity engine .
The game takes place in one large map , rendered at 1080p and 60 frames per second with no visible loading time as the player explores .
According to Mahler , the game 's backgrounds are all individual components , with none duplicated as in other similar titles .
As an example , Mahler explained , " You see this tree in the background and this mushroom and this rock ?
That 's the one and only place you 'll ever see those assets . "
The game was first unveiled at E3 2014 during Microsoft 's pre - show press conference at the Galen Center ; E3 was also the first time a number of Moon Studios employees actually met face - to - face .
Microsoft 's Yusuf Mehdi , in charge of marketing for Xbox One , stated that they considered opening the conference with Ori , but instead chose .

, there has been no further announcement on the status of the Xbox 360 release .
A " Definitive Edition " was announced at Gamescom 2015 .
The expansion contains new areas , mechanics , and artwork .
Specifically , it adds in an " easy " , " hard " , and " One Life " difficulty levels , and enables fast - travel between spirit wells to help traverse the game 's world .
