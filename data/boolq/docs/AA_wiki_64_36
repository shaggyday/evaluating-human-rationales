BLUE ANGELS
The Blue Angels is the United States Navy 's flight demonstration squadron , with aviators from the Navy and Marines .
The Blue Angels team was formed in 1946 , making it the second oldest formal flying aerobatic team ( under the same name ) in the world , after the French Patrouille de France formed in 1931 .
The Blue Angels ' six demonstration pilots currently fly the McDonnell Douglas F / A-18 Hornet , typically in more than 70 shows at 34 locations throughout the United States each year , where they still employ many of the same practices and techniques used in their aerial displays in their inaugural 1946 season .
An estimated 11 million spectators view the squadron during air shows each full year .
The Blue Angels also visit more than 50,000 people in a standard show season ( March through November ) in schools and hospitals .
Since 1946 , the Blue Angels have flown for more than 260 million spectators .
As of November 2011 , the Blue Angels received $ 37 million annually out of the annual DoD budget .
MISSION Section::::Mission .
The mission of the United States Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron is " To showcase the pride and professionalism of the United States Navy and Marine Corps by inspiring a culture of excellence and service to country through flight demonstrations and community outreach . "
SHOWS Section::::Shows .
The Blue Angels ' show season runs each year from March until November .
They perform at both military and civilian airfields , and often perform directly over major cities such as San Francisco 's " Fleet Week " maritime festival , Cleveland 's annual Labor Day Air Show , the Chicago Air and Water Show , Jacksonville 's Sea and Sky Spectacular , Milwaukee Air and Water Show , and Seattle 's annual Seafair festival .
A show is also performed for the United States Naval Academy including a flyover of graduation ceremonies .
During their aerobatic demonstration , the Blues fly six F / A-18 Hornet aircraft , split into the Diamond Formation ( Blue Angels 1 through 4 ) and the Lead and Opposing Solos ( Blue Angels 5 and 6 ) .
Most of the show alternates between maneuvers performed by the Diamond Formation and those performed by the Solos .
The Diamond , in tight formation and usually at lower speeds ( 400 mph ) , performs maneuvers such as formation loops , rolls , and transitions from one formation to another .
The Solos showcase the high performance capabilities of their individual aircraft through the execution of high - speed passes , slow passes , fast rolls , slow rolls , and very tight turns .
The highest speed flown during an air show is 700 mph ( just under Mach 1 ) and the lowest speed is 120 mph .
Some of the maneuvers include both solo aircraft performing at once , such as opposing passes ( toward each other in what appears to be a collision course ) and mirror formations ( back - to - back .
belly - to - belly , or wingtip - to - wingtip , with one jet flying inverted ) .
The Solos join the Diamond Formation near the end of the show for a number of maneuvers in the Delta Formation .
The parameters of each show must be tailored in accordance with local weather conditions at showtime : in clear weather the high show is performed ; in overcast conditions a low show is performed , and in limited visibility ( weather permitting )
the flat show is presented .
The high show requires at least an ceiling and visibility of at least from the show 's centerpoint .
The minimum ceilings allowed for low and flat shows are 3,500 feet ( ~1 km ) and , respectively .
AIRCRAFT Section::::Aircraft .
The team flies fighter aircraft which have formerly served in the fleet and are maintained to nearly combat - ready status .
Modifications to each aircraft include removal of the weapons and replacement with the tank that contains smoke - oil used in demonstrations , and outfitting with the control stick spring system for more precise aircraft control input .
Control sticks are tensioned with of force installed on the control stick as to allow the pilot minimal room for uncommanded movement .
The show 's narrator flies Blue Angel 7 , a two - seat F / A-18D Hornet , to show sites .
The Blues use this jet for backup , and to give demonstration rides to VIP civilians .
Three backseats at each show are available ; one of them goes to members of the press , the other two to " Key Influencers " .
The No . 4 slot pilot often flies the No . 7 aircraft in Friday 's " practice " shows .
The Blue Angels use a United States Marine Corps Lockheed C-130 T Hercules , nicknamed " Fat Albert " , for their logistics , carrying spare parts , equipment , and to carry support personnel between shows .
Beginning in 1975 , " Bert " was used for
Jet Assisted Take Off ( JATO ) and short aerial demonstrations just prior to the main event at selected venues , but the JATO demonstration ended in 2009 due to dwindling supplies of rockets . "
Fat Albert Airlines " flies with an all - Marine crew of three officers and five enlisted personnel .
In August 2018 Boeing was awarded a contract to convert nine single - seat F / A-18E Super Hornets and two F / A-18F two - seaters for Blue Angels use , the converted aircraft are due to be completed 2021 .
TEAM MEMBERS Section::::Team members .
All team members , both officer and enlisted , pilots and staff officers , come from the ranks of regular Navy and United States Marine Corps units .
The demonstration pilots and narrator are made up of Navy and USMC Naval Aviators .
Pilots serve two to three years , and position assignments are made according to team needs , pilot experience levels , and career considerations for members .
Other officers in the squadron , including a Naval Flight Officer who serves as the Events Coordinator , three USMC C-130 pilots , an Executive Officer , a Maintenance Officer , a Supply Officer , a Public Affairs Officer , an Administrative Officer , and a Flight Surgeon .
Enlisted members range from E-4 to E-9 and perform all maintenance , administrative , and support functions .
They serve three to four years in the squadron .
After serving with the squadron , members return to fleet assignments .
The officer selection process requires pilots and support officers ( flight surgeon , events coordinator , maintenance officer , supply officer , and public affairs officer ) wishing to become Blue Angels to apply formally via their chain - of - command , with a personal statement , letters of recommendation , and flight records .
Navy and Marine Corps F / A-18 demonstration pilots and naval flight officers are required to have a minimum of 1,250 tactical jet hours and be carrier - qualified .
Marine Corps C-130 demonstration pilots are required to have 1,200 flight hours and be an aircraft commander .
Applicants " rush " the team at one or more airshows , paid out of their own finances , and sit in on team briefs , post - show activities , and social events .
Rushes are asked to tell a joke prior to the brief and are graded by the team as part of the rigorous selection process .
Team members vote in secret on the next year 's members , with no accountability to the higher Navy authority why an applicant was or was not selected .
Selections must be unanimous .
There have been female and racial minority staff officers as Blue Angel members , including minority Blue Angel pilot
Lt .
Andre Webb on the 2018 team .
Flight surgeons serve a two - year term .
They act as the team recorder during air shows and help oversee emergency response planning with the various air show planners .
The first female Blue Angel flight surgeon was Lt .
Tamara Schnurr , who was a member of the 2001 team .
The team leader ( # 1 ) is the Commanding Officer and is always a Navy Commander , who may be promoted to Captain mid - tour if approved for Captain by the selection board .
Pilots of numbers 2â€“7 are Navy Lieutenants or Lieutenant Commanders , or Marine Corps Captains or Majors .
The number 7 pilot narrates for a year , and then typically flies Opposing and then Lead Solo the following two years , respectively .
The number 3 pilot moves to the number 4 ( slot ) position for his second year .
Blue Angel No .
4 serves as the demonstration safety officer , due largely to the perspective he is afforded from the slot position within the formation , as well as his status as a second - year demonstration pilot .
COMMANDING OFFICER
Section::::Commanding officer .
Commander Eric C. Doyle is from League City , Texas and graduated from Texas A&M with a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering in 1996 .
After college , Eric went to Officer Candidate School in Pensacola , Florida , where he was commissioned as an Ensign in the U.S. Navy in December 1996 .
Doyle has accumulated more than 3,000 flight hours and has 600 carrier - arrested landings .
His decorations include the Meritorious Service Medal , seven Strike / Flight Air Medal , five Navy Commendation Medal , a Navy Achievement Medal and various personal , unit and service awards .
He joined the Blue Angels in September 2017 .
TRAINING AND WEEKLY
ROUTINE
Section::::Training and weekly routine .
Annual winter training takes place at NAF El Centro , California , where new and returning pilots hone skills learned in the fleet .
During winter training , the pilots fly two practice sessions per day , six days a week , in order to fly the 120 training missions needed to perform the demonstration safely .
Separation between the formation of aircraft and their maneuver altitude is gradually reduced over the course of about two months in January and February .
The team then returns to their home base in Pensacola , Florida , in March , and continues to practice throughout the show season .
A typical week during the season has practices at NAS Pensacola on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings .
The team then flies to its show venue for the upcoming weekend on Thursday , conducting " circle and arrival " orientation maneuvers upon arrival .
The team flies a " practice " airshow at the show site on Friday .
This show is attended by invited guests but is often open to the general public .
The main airshows are conducted on Saturdays and Sundays , with the team returning home to NAS Pensacola on Sunday evenings after the show .
Monday is the Blues ' day off .
Pilots maneuver the flight stick with their right hand and operate the throttle with their left .
They do not wear G - suits because the air bladders inside repeatedly deflate and inflate , interfering with that stability .
To prevent blood from pooling in their legs , Blue Angel pilots have developed a method for tensing their muscles to prevent blood from pooling in their lower extremities , possibly rendering them unconscious .
HISTORY ORIGINS Section::::History .
Section::::Origins .
Formed as the Flight Exhibition Team in March 1946 at Naval Air Station ( NAS )
Jacksonville , Florida by Chief of Naval Operations , Admiral Chester Nimitz , in an effort to raise awareness of naval aviation and boost morale .
The team performed their first flight demonstration on June 15 , 1946 in Grumman F6F-5 Hellcat aircraft .
The squadron was officially redesignated as the United States Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron in December 1974 .
The Blue Angels name was suggested by Right Wing Pilot Lt . Maurice " Wick " Wickendoll after reading about the Blue Angel nightclub in The New Yorker magazine .
The first official Blue Angels team insignia or " crest " was designed in 1949 by Flight Leader Lt . Cmdr .
Raleigh " Dusty " Rhodes .
The aircraft silhouettes change as the team changes aircraft .
Originally , demonstration aircraft were navy blue ( nearly black ) with gold lettering .
The current shades of blue and yellow were adopted when the team transitioned to the Bearcat in 1946 .
For a single year , in 1949 , the team performed in an all - yellow scheme with blue markings .
1940S Section::::1940s .
On 24 April 1946 , Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Chester Nimitz issued a directive ordering the formation of a flight exhibition team to boost Navy morale , demonstrate naval air power , and maintain public interest in naval aviation .
However , an underlying mission was to help the Navy generate public and political support for a larger allocation of the shrinking defense budget .
In April of that year , Rear Admiral Ralph Davison personally selected Lieutenant Commander Roy Marlin " Butch " Voris , a World War II fighter ace , to assemble and train a flight demonstration team , naming him Officer - in - Charge and Flight Leader .
Voris selected three fellow instructors to join him ( Lt . Maurice " Wick " Wickendoll , Lt . Mel Cassidy , and Lt . Cmdr .
Lloyd Barnard , veterans of the War in the Pacific ) , and they spent countless hours developing the show .
The group perfected its initial maneuvers in secret over the Florida Everglades so that , in Voris ' words , " if anything happened , just the alligators would know " .
The team 's first demonstration before Navy officials took place on 10 May 1946 and was met with enthusiastic approval .
On 15 June Voris led a trio of Grumman F6F-5 Hellcats , specially modified to reduce weight and painted sea blue with gold leaf trim , through their inaugural 15-minute - long performance at their Florida home base , Naval Air Station Jacksonville .
The team employed a North American SNJ Texan , painted and configured to simulate a Japanese Zero , to simulate aerial combat .
This aircraft was later painted yellow and dubbed the " Beetle Bomb " .
This aircraft is said to have been inspired by one of the Spike Jones ' Murdering the Classics series of musical satires , set to the tune ( in part ) of the William Tell Overture as a thoroughbred horse race scene , with " Beetle Bomb " being the " trailing horse " in the lyrics .
The team thrilled spectators with low - flying maneuvers performed in tight formations , and ( according to Voris ) by " keeping something in front of the crowds at all times .
My objective was to beat the Army Air Corps .
If we did that , we 'd get all the other side issues .
I felt that if we were n't the best , it would be my naval career . "
The Blue Angels ' first public demonstration also netted the team its first trophy , which sits on display at the team 's current home at NAS Pensacola .
On 25 August 1946 the squadron upgraded their aircraft to the Grumman F8F-1 Bearcat .
In May 1947 , flight leader Lt . Cmdr .
Bob Clarke replaced Butch Voris as the leader of the team and introduced the famous Diamond Formation , now considered the Blue Angels ' trademark .
In 1949 , the team acquired a Douglas R4D Skytrain for logistics to and from show sites .
The team 's SNJ was also replaced by a F8F-1 " Bearcat " , painted yellow for the air combat routine , inheriting the " Beetle Bomb " nickname .
The Blues transitioned to the straight - wing Grumman Grumman F9F-2 Panther on 13 July 1949 , wherein the F8F-1 " Beetle Bomb " was relegated to solo aerobatics before the main show , until it crashed on takeoff at a training show in Pensacola in 1950 .
Team headquarters shifted from NAS Corpus Christi , Texas , to NAAS Whiting Field , Florida , in the fall of 1949 , announced 14 July 1949 .
1950S
Section::::1950s .
The " Blues " continued to perform nationwide until the start of the Korean War in 1950 , when ( due to a shortage of pilots , and no planes were available ) the team was disbanded and its members were ordered to combat duty .
Once aboard the aircraft carrier the group formed the core of VF-191 , Satan 's Kittens .
The Blue Angels were officially recommissioned on 25 October 1951 , and reported to NAS Corpus Christi , Texas .
Lt .
Cdr .
Voris was again tasked with assembling the team ( he was the first of only two commanding officers to lead them twice ) .
In 1953 the team traded its Sky Train for a Curtiss R5C Commando .
In August 1953 , " Blues " leader LCDR Ray Hawkins became the first naval aviator to survive an ejection at supersonic speeds when his F9F-6 became uncontrollable on a cross - country flight .
The first Marine Corps pilot , Capt Chuck Hiett , joined the team and they relocated to their current home of NAS Pensacola in the winter of 1954 .
It was here they progressed to the swept - wing Grumman F9F-8 Cougar .
In September 1956 , the team added a sixth aircraft to the flight demonstration in the Opposing Solo position , and gave its first performance outside the United States at the International Air Exposition in Toronto , Ontario , Canada .
It also upgraded its logistics aircraft to the Douglas R5D Skymaster .
In January 1957 , the team left its winter training facility at Naval Air Facility El Centro , California for a ten - year period .
For the next ten years , the team would winter at NAS Key West , Florida .
For the 1957 show season , the Blue Angels transitioned to the supersonic Grumman F11F-1 Tiger , first flying the short - nosed , and then the long - nosed versions .
The first Six - Plane Delta Maneuvers were added in the 1958 season .
1960S
Section::::1960s .
In July 1964 , the Blue Angels participated in the Aeronaves de Mexico Anniversary Air Show over Mexico City , Mexico , before an estimated crowd of 1.5 million people .
In 1965 , the Blue Angels conducted a Caribbean island tour , flying at five sites .
Later that year , they embarked on a European tour to a dozen sites , including the Paris Air Show , where they were the only team to receive a standing ovation .
The Blues toured Europe again in 1967 touring six sites .
In 1968 the C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft was replaced with a Lockheed VC-121J Constellation .
The Blues transitioned to the two - seat McDonnell Douglas F-4J Phantom II in 1969 , nearly always keeping the back seat empty for flight demonstrations .
The Phantom was the only plane to be flown by both the " Blues " and the United States Air Force Thunderbirds .
That year they also upgraded to the Lockheed C-121 Super Constellation for logistics .
1970S Section::::1970s .
The Blues received their first U.S. Marine Corps Lockheed KC-130F Hercules in 1970 .
An all - Marine crew manned it .
That year , they went on their first South American tour .
In 1971 , the team conducted its first Far East Tour , performing at a dozen locations in Korea , Japan , Taiwan , Guam , and the Philippines .
In 1972 , the Blue Angels were awarded the Navy 's Meritorious Unit Commendation for the two - year period from 1 March 1970 â€“ 31 December 1971 .
Another European tour followed in 1973 , including air shows in Tehran , Iran , England , France , Spain , Turkey , Greece , and Italy .
In December 1974 the Navy Flight Demonstration Team downsized to the subsonic Douglas A-4F Skyhawk II and was reorganized into the Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron .
This reorganization permitted the establishment of a commanding officer ( the flight leader ) , added support officers , and further redefined the squadron 's mission emphasizing the support of recruiting efforts .
Commander Tony Less was the squadron 's first official commanding officer .
1980S
Section::::1980s .
On 8 November 1986
the Blue Angels completed their 40th anniversary year during ceremonies unveiling their present aircraft , the McDonnell Douglas F / A-18 Hornet .
The power and aerodynamics of the Hornet allows them to perform a slow , high angle of attack " tail sitting " maneuver , and to fly a " dirty " ( landing gear down ) formation loop .
Also in 1986 , LCDR Donnie Cochran , joined the Blue Angels as the first African - American Naval Aviator to be selected .
He would return to lead the team in 1993 .
1990S Section::::1990s .
In 1992 the Blue Angels deployed for a month - long European tour , their first in 19 years , conducting shows in Sweden , Finland , Russia ( first foreign flight demonstration team to perform there ) , Romania , Bulgaria , Italy , the United Kingdom , and Spain .
In 1998 , CDR Patrick Driscoll made the first " Blue Jet " landing on a " haze gray and underway " aircraft carrier , USS Harry S. Truman ( CVN-75 ) .
2000S
Section::::2000s .
In 2006 , the Blue Angels marked their 60th year of performing .
On 30 October 2008 a spokesman for the team announced that the team would complete its last three performances of the year with five jets instead of six .
The change was because one pilot and another officer in the organization had been removed from duty for engaging in an " inappropriate relationship " .
The Navy stated that one of the individuals was a man and the other a woman , one a Marine and the other from the Navy , and that Rear Admiral Mark Guadagnini , chief of Naval air training , was reviewing the situation .
At the next performance at Lackland Air Force Base following the announcement the No . 4 or slot pilot , was absent from the formation .
A spokesman for the team would not confirm the identity of the pilot removed from the team .
On 6 November 2008 both officers were found guilty at an admiral 's mast on unspecified charges but the resulting punishment was not disclosed .
The names of the two members involved were later released on the Pensacola News Journal website / forum as pilot No .
4 USMC Maj .
Clint Harris and the administrative officer , Navy Lt .
Gretchen Doane .
The Fat Albert performed its final JATO demonstration at the 2009 Pensacola Homecoming show , expending their 8 remaining JATO bottles .
This demonstration not only was the last JATO performance of the squadron , but also the final JATO use of the U.S. Marine Corps .
In 2009 , the Blue Angels were inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum .
2010S Section::::2010s .
On 22 May 2011 , the Blue Angels were performing at the Lynchburg Regional Airshow in Lynchburg , Virginia , when the Diamond formation flew the Barrel Roll Break maneuver at an altitude that was lower than the required minimum altitude .
The maneuver was aborted , the remainder of the demonstration canceled and all aircraft landed safely .
The next day , the Blue Angels announced that they were initiating a safety stand - down , canceling their upcoming Naval Academy Airshow and returning to their home base in Pensacola , Florida , for additional training and airshow practice .
On 26 May , the Blue Angels announced they would not be flying their traditional fly - over of the Naval Academy Graduation Ceremony and that they were canceling their 28â€“29 May 2011 performances at the Millville Wings and Wheels Airshow in Millville , New Jersey .
On 27 May 2011 , the Blue Angels announced that Commander Dave Koss , the squadron 's Commanding Officer , would be stepping down .
He was replaced by Captain Greg McWherter , the team 's previous Commanding Officer .
The squadron canceled performances at the Rockford , Illinois Airfest 4â€“5 June and the Evansville , Indiana Freedom Festival Air Show 11â€“12 June to allow additional practice and demonstration training under McWherter 's leadership .
Between 2 and 4 September 2011 on Labor Day weekend , the Blue Angels flew for the first time with a 50â€“50 blend of conventional JP-5 jet fuel and a camelina - based biofuel at Naval Air Station Patuxent River airshow at Patuxent River , Maryland .
McWherter flew an F / A-18 test flight on 17 August and stated there were no noticeable differences in performance from inside the cockpit .
On 1 March 2013 , the U.S. Navy announced that it was cancelling remaining 2013 performances after 1 April 2013 due to sequestration budget constraints .
In October 2013 , Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel , stating that " community and public outreach is a crucial Departmental activity " , announced that the Blue Angels ( along with the U.S. Air Force 's Thunderbirds ) would resume appearing at air shows starting in 2014 , although the number of flyovers will continue to be severely reduced .
In June 2014 , Captain Greg McWherter , flight leader of the Blue Angels for 2008 - 2010 and 2011 - 2012 , received letter of reprimand from Adm. Harry Harris after an admiral 's mast for " failing to stop obvious and repeated instances of sexual harassment , condoning widespread lewd practices within the squadron and engaging in inappropriate and unprofessional discussions with his junior officers " during his second tour with the team .
In July 2014 , Marine Corps Capt .
Katie Higgins , 27 , became the first female pilot to join the Blue Angels .
In July 2015 , Cmdr Bob Flynn became the Blue Angels ' first Executive Officer .
In July 2016 , Boeing was awarded a $ 12 million contract to begin an engineering proposal for converting the Boeing F / A-18E / F Super Hornet for Blue Angels use , with the proposal to be completed by September 2017 .

Capt .
Jeff " Kooch " Kuss , ( Opposing Solo , Blue Angel No . 6 ) , died just after takeoff while performing the Split - S maneuver in his F / A-18 Hornet during a practice run for The Great Tennessee Air Show in Smyrna , Tennessee .
The Navy investigation found that Capt . Kuss performed the maneuver at too low of an altitude while failing to retard the throttle out of afterburner , causing him to fall too fast and recover at too low of an altitude .
Capt .
Kuss ejected , but his parachute was immediately engulfed in flames , causing him to fall to his death .
Kuss ' body was recovered multiple yards away from the crash site .
The cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head .
