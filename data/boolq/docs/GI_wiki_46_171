CONTESTANT ELIGIBILITY Section::::Contestant eligibility .
There are some requirements contestants must meet before participating at a regional qualifier .
Contestants must be legal residents of the United States and be in decent physical shape .
There is no upper age limit , though participants must be at least 19 years old ( 21 years old during the first nine seasons ) .
Contestants must fill out a 20-page questionnaire and make a video about themselves .
The required length of the video has differed over the years .
Submission video length requirements have varied from 2 to 8 minutes , depending on the season .
1,000 people applied to compete in season one , 5,000 people in season six , 50,000 in season seven , 70,000 in season eight , and 77,000 in season nine .
Producers then select 100 contestants from the thousands of applicants to participate in each regional qualifier .
They also select 20 to 30 " walk - ons " who may wait weeks camping outside to get a chance on the course .
CITY QUALIFYING AND FINALS Section::::City qualifying and finals .
In each city qualifier course , the competitors that the producers have selected compete on an obstacle course consisting of six obstacles .
Descriptions of each obstacle in each course are provided by the sideline reporter at the beginning of an episode .
At the beginning of each run , a buzzer sounds off , allowing a competitor to begin the course .
A timer begins simultaneously .
The first obstacle on any city qualifying course is the quintuple steps or floating steps , in which competitors must run across .
This is followed by four different obstacles that test a competitors balance , upper - body strength and grip .
These five obstacles are built above water .
If a competitor falls into the water or touches it , their run ends immediately and the timer records their time .
Until season nine , the sixth and final obstacle was the 14'6 " warped wall , in which competitors are given three chances to reach the top .
In season ten , the 18-foot " Mega Wall " was introduced adjacent to the warped wall .
Competitors have only one attempt to reach the top of the Mega Wall , and if successful , will win $ 10,000 .
However , if unsuccessful , the competitor will only get one attempt at the warped wall .
Competitors are given the choice of which to climb .
At the top of both walls , there is a buzzer a competitor presses which stops the timer and records their time , ending their run on the course .
The top 30 competitors who go the farthest the fastest advance to the city finals course .
Since season nine , the top five women also advance to the city finals , regardless if they finished in the top 30 .
City finals courses are the follow - up to each city qualifying course .
They contain four new obstacles , in addition to the six obstacles featured in the city qualifying course .
These four obstacles are all placed after the original six obstacles .
As of season ten , two of the original six obstacles are replaced with new obstacles for the city finals course .
The top 15 competitors who go the farthest the fastest from each city finals course move on to compete on the National Finals course .
As of season nine , the top two women in each city finals course also move on to compete on the National Finals course , even if they do not finish in the top 15 .
Small prizes ranging from $ 1,000 to $ 5,000 are awarded to first , second , and third finishers who complete the city finals course .
Qualifying and finals courses are filmed back - to - back , usually over two nights .
Obstacles are designed and produced in the five months prior to an episode taping , with 3â€“4 new ones per city .
In season eight , 18 obstacles were debuted .

SEASON 4 ( 2012 )
Section::::Season 4 ( 2012 ) .
The fourth season of American Ninja Warrior began airing on May 20 , 2012 , on both G4 and NBC .
There were six regional competitions held in three locations : Venice Beach ( Southwest and Northwest ) , Dallas ( Midwest and Midsouth ) , and Miami ( Northeast and Southeast ) , that determined the 100 competitors to participate in the qualifying rounds .
The winner of the ANW season four competition would receive $ 500,000 and the coveted " American Ninja Warrior " title .
The season finale , held in Las Vegas , was the first time that Mount Midori was held on U.S. soil .
Submission videos for American Ninja Warrior season 4 had been collected since January 25 , 2012 .
The entire format was changed as well â€“ regional qualifiers in different parts of the country were aired , and the Mt. Midori course was recreated just off the Las Vegas Strip for the national finals .
The regional qualifiers would narrow down its selections down to 30 contestants who finished its qualifying course in the fastest time as well as the contestants who finished the furthest the fastest .

The 100 contestants who qualified ( including wild cards ) earned tickets to Las Vegas to challenge Mt. Midori .

The network switch was eventually delayed to September 23 , 2013 , and Esquire took over Style Network 's channel space instead .
Because of this , additional reruns of the season aired on Saturday nights on NBC through the summer to maintain ratings momentum due to G4 's lame duck status , with ANW being their only new program since they wound down all their original programming in January 2013 .
The success of the NBC re - airings led to the series being considered for NBC 's main summer schedule for the next season .
Regional competitions were held in Venice Beach , Baltimore , Miami , and Denver .
Tryouts for the season began in February 2013 and ended with the last of the regional rounds taking place the following May.
