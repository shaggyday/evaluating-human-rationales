TO ERR IS HUMAN ( REPORT )
To Err
Is Human :
Building a Safer Health System is a report issued in November 1999 by the U.S. Institute of Medicine that may have resulted in increased awareness of U.S. medical errors .
The push for patient safety that followed its release continues .
The report was based upon analysis of multiple studies by a variety of organizations and concluded that between 44,000 to 98,000 people die each year as a result of preventable medical errors .
For comparison , fewer than 50,000 people died of Alzheimer 's disease and 17,000 died of illicit drug use in the same year .
The report called for a comprehensive effort by health care providers , government , consumers , and others .
Claiming knowledge of how to prevent these errors already existed , it set a minimum goal of 50 percent reduction in errors over the next five years .
Though not currently quantified , this ambitious goal has yet to be met .
IMPACT
Section::::Impact .
The report " brought the issues of medical error and patient safety to the forefront of national concern " .
The report has been called " groundbreaking " for suggesting that 2 - 4 % of all deaths in the United States are caused by medical errors .
The report is credited with raising awareness of the extent to which medical error was a problem .
The report described that errors were not rare or isolated , and only by broad planning could they be diminished .
It also described that most errors are systemic in the health care industry , and can not be resolved at the level of individual health care providers .
RESPONSES Section::::Responses .
The report had a huge impact on management of health care .
As a result of the report President Bill Clinton signed Senate bill 580 , the Healthcare Research and Quality Act of 1999 , which renamed The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research to Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to indicate a change in focus .
The bill also funded projects through that organization .
FOLLOW UP Section::::Follow up .
The report was followed in 2001 by another widely cited Institute of Medicine report , " Crossing the Quality Chasm , " which furthers many points from the original study .
Both are widely referenced .
"
To Err Is Human " was the inspiration for the Institute for Healthcare Improvement 's 100,000 Lives Campaign , which in 2006 claimed to have prevented an estimated 124,000 deaths in a period of 18 months through patient - safety initiatives in over 3,000 hospitals .
