SQ3R
SQRRR or SQ3R is a reading comprehension method named for its five steps : survey , question , read , recite , and review .
The method was introduced by Francis P. Robinson , an American education philosopher in his 1946 book Effective Study .
The method offers a more efficient and active approach to reading textbook material .
It was created for college students , but is extremely useful for young students as well .
Classrooms all over the world have begun using this method to better understand what they are reading .
Similar methods developed subsequently include PQRST and KWL table .
PROCESS
* Survey * The first step , survey or skim , advises that one should resist the temptation to read the book and instead first go through a chapter and note headings , sub - headings and other outstanding features , such as figures , tables , and summary paragraphs .
This survey step only takes 3–5 minutes , but it provides an outline or framework for what will be presented .
The reader should identify ideas and formulate questions about the content of the chapter .
* Question * Generate questions about the content of the reading .
For example , convert headings and sub - headings into questions , and then look for answers in the content of the text .
Other more general questions may also be formulated : * " What is this chapter about ?
* What question is this chapter trying to answer ?
* How does this information help me ?
*
The Question step again only takes 3–5 minutes to complete , but it will motivate the reader to seek answers to the questions .
*
Read ( R ) * Use the background work done with " S " and " Q " in order to begin reading actively .
This means reading in order to answer the questions raised under " Q " .
Passive reading , in contrast , results in merely reading without engaging with the study material .
* Recite ( R )
* The second " R " refers to the part known as " Recite .
" The reader should try to retrieve from memory what was learned in the same manner as telling someone else about the information .
It is important that the reader use his / her own words in order to formulate and conceptualize the material .
Try recalling and identifying major points ( heading / subheadings ) and answers to questions from the " Q " step .
This recital step may be done either in an oral or written format and is related to the benefits of retrieval ( testing effect ) in boosting long - term memory for the material .
* Review ( R ) * The final " R " is " Review .
" Once you reach the end of the passage , say back to yourself what the point of the whole passage is – again , using your own words .
You may then repeat the process on the second set of questions .
SIX STAGES OF EFFECTIVE COMPREHENSION Section::::Six stages of effective comprehension .
Best 's process of effective comprehension suggests six stages for better understanding a topic while in a learning process .
* Knowing vs Understanding what the passage says ( Fact finding vs Making meaning with time management ) .
* Reflecting ( Bringing the information to life in your own words to personalize and consolidate ) .
* Interpersonal understanding ( Checking whether the reader understood the topic e.g. Explaining the idea to someone , doing seminars ... etc . )
* Intrapersonal understanding ( Finding personal significance ( interpret , compare & conclude tentatively ) of the topic in real world aspects ) * Visualisation ( Tony Buzan 's Mind Mapping ) * Mindfulness and Acceptance SEE ALSO * KWL table * PQRST ( study skill ) * Pareto principle
* Study skills
* Speed reading * Spaced repetition * Cornell Notes
* Francis P. Robinson
