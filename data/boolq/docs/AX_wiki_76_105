FLUID OUNCE
A fluid ounce ( abbreviated fl oz , fl .
oz .
or oz .
fl .
, old forms ℥ , fl ℥ , f ℥ , ƒ ℥ ) is a unit of volume ( also called capacity ) typically used for measuring liquids .
Various definitions have been used throughout history , but only two are still in common use : the British Imperial and the United States customary fluid ounce .
An imperial fluid ounce is of an imperial pint , of an imperial gallon or approximately 28.41 ml .
A US fluid ounce is of a US fluid pint and of a US liquid gallon or approximately 29.57 ml , making it about 4 % larger than the imperial fluid ounce .
The fluid ounce is distinct from the ounce as a unit of weight or mass , although it is sometimes referred to simply as an " ounce " where context makes the meaning clear , such as ounces in a bottle .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The fluid ounce was originally the volume occupied by one ounce of some substance , such as wine ( in England ) or water ( in Scotland ) .
The ounce in question varied depending on the system of fluid measure , such as that used for wine versus ale .
Various ounces were used over the centuries , including the Tower ounce , troy ounce , avoirdupois ounce , and various ounces used in international trade , such as Paris troy .
The situation is further complicated by the medieval practice of " allowances " , whereby a unit of measure was not necessarily equal to the sum of its parts .
For example , the had a for the weight of the sack and other packaging materials .
In 1824 , the British Parliament defined the imperial gallon as the volume of ten pounds of water at standard temperature .
The gallon was divided into four quarts , the quart into two pints , the pint into four gills , and the gill into five ounces .
Thus , there were 160 imperial fluid ounces to the gallon making the mass of a fluid ounce of water approximately one avoirdupois ounce ( 28.4 g ) .
This relationship is still approximately valid even though the imperial gallon 's definition was later revised to be 4.54609 litres , making the imperial fluid ounce exactly 28.4130625 ml .
The US fluid ounce is based on the US gallon , which is based on the wine gallon of 231 cubic inches that was used in England prior to 1824 .
With the adoption of the international inch , the US fluid ounce became 29.5735295625 ml exactly , or about 4 % larger than the imperial unit .
