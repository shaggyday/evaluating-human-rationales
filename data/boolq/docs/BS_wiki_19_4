LIBERIA NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM
The Liberia national football team , nicknamed the Lone Stars , is the national association football team of Liberia and is controlled by the Liberia Football Association .
Although the country produced the 1995 FIFA World Player of the Year , George Weah , they have never reached the World Cup finals .
Weah has been a patron of the Liberian team ; not only has he played for and coached the side , but he also sponsored the team with his own money .
Liberia has twice qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations – 1996 and 2002 .
In 2010 , the Hungarian Bertalan Bicskei , former coach of the national teams of Hungary and Malaysia , was named head coach of the Liberian national team .
After being poisoned and seeking medical treatment , he was replaced by Roberto Landi for the rest of 2011 .
Since the retirement of George Weah , the roster of the national team changed significantly .
Currently , a lot of Liberian international footballers play in foreign leagues , strikingly often in the Asian countries like in Indonesia and Malaysia .
