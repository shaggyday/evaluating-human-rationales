COMPOSITION Section::::Composition .
" Duel of the Fates " was composed by John Williams and recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra ( LSO ) and the London Voices for the film soundtrack .
The symphonic piece is played with both a full orchestra and a choir .
The lyrics are based on a fragment of an archaic Welsh poem Cad Goddeu ( Battle of the Trees ) , and sung in Sanskrit .
The translation was loose and Williams arranged it by ear , while rearranging the syllables , so the pronunciation of the Sanskrit is n't accurate and the meaning of the stanza is lost in the actual singing .
Although Williams conducted " Duel of the Fates " to appear as a concert suite in the end credits ( rather than the film ) , Williams did record similar cues using the ostinato motif , and in one instance , a ' cut down ' version , labelled the " Great Duel " .
John Williams stated the chorus was introduced to give a religious , temple - like feel to the epic lightsaber duel .
Williams compared the setting of the battle to a pagan altar , and that the duel itself " seems like a dance or a ballet , a religious ceremony of some kind , probably ending in the death of one of the combatants " .
