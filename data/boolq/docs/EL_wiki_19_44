GLUCOGENIC AMINO ACID
A glucogenic amino acid is an amino acid that can be converted into glucose through gluconeogenesis .
This is in contrast to the ketogenic amino acids , which are converted into ketone bodies .
The production of glucose from glucogenic amino acids involves these amino acids being converted to alpha keto acids and then to glucose , with both processes occurring in the liver .
This mechanism predominates during catabolysis , rising as fasting and starvation increase in severity .
In humans , the glucogenic amino acids are : *
Alanine *
Arginine *
Asparagine
* Aspartic acid * Cysteine * Glutamic acid * Glutamine * Glycine
* Histidine *
Methionine *
Proline *
Serine * Valine Amino acids that are both glucogenic and ketogenic ( mnemonic " PITTT " ) :
* Phenylalanine * Isoleucine * Threonine
* Tryptophan * Tyrosine Only leucine and lysine are not glucogenic ( they are only ketogenic ) .
