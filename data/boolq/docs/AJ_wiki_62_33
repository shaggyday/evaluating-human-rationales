CONCEPT AND CREATION Section::::Concept and creation .
Shigeru Miyamoto created Mario while developing Donkey Kong in an attempt to produce a best - selling video game for Nintendo ; previous titles like Sheriff had not achieved the same success as titles like Pac - Man .
Originally , Miyamoto wanted to create a video game that used the characters Popeye , Bluto , and Olive Oyl .
At the time , however , Miyamoto was unable to acquire a license to use the characters ( and would not until 1982 with Popeye ) , so he ended up making an unnamed player character , Donkey Kong , and Lady ( later known as Pauline ) .
In the early stages of Donkey Kong , Mario was unable to jump , and the focus was to escape a maze .
However , Miyamoto enabled Mario to jump , saying " If you had a barrel rolling towards you , what would you do ? "
While the protagonist was unnamed in the Japanese release , he would be named Jumpman in the game 's English instructions and Mario in the sales brochure .
Miyamoto originally named the character " Mr. Video " , and he was to be used in every video game Miyamoto developed .
According to a widely circulated story , during localization of Donkey Kong for American audiences , Nintendo of America 's warehouse landlord Mario Segale confronted then - president Minoru Arakawa , demanding back rent .
Following a heated argument in which the Nintendo employees eventually convinced Segale he would be paid , they opted to name the character in the game Mario after him .
Miyamoto commented that if he had named Mario " Mr. Video " , Mario likely would have " disappeared off the face of the Earth " .
By Miyamoto 's own account , Mario 's profession was chosen to fit with the game design .
Since Donkey Kong was set on a construction site , Mario was made into a carpenter .
When he appeared again in Mario Bros. , it was decided he should be a plumber , since a lot of the game is played in underground settings .
Mario 's character design , particularly his large nose , draws on western influences ; once he became a plumber , Miyamoto decided to " put him in New York " and make him Italian , lightheartedly attributing Mario 's nationality to his mustache .
Other sources have Mario 's profession chosen to be carpenter in an effort to depict the character as an ordinary hard worker , and make it easier for players to identify with him .
After a colleague suggested that Mario more closely resembled a plumber , Miyamoto changed Mario 's profession accordingly and developed Mario Bros. , featuring the character in the sewers of New York City .
Due to the graphical limitations of arcade hardware at the time , Miyamoto clothed the character in red overalls and a blue shirt to contrast against each other and the background .
A red cap was added to let Miyamoto avoid drawing the character 's hairstyle , forehead , and eyebrows , as well as to circumvent the issue of animating his hair as he jumped .
To give distinctly human facial features on an 8×8 pixel head , Miyamoto drew a large nose and a mustache , which avoided the need to draw a mouth and facial expressions .
Miyamoto envisioned a " go to " character that could be put into any game as needed , albeit in cameo appearances , as at the time Miyamoto was not expecting the character to become singularly popular .
To this end , he originally called the character " Mr. Video " , comparing his intent for appearances in later games to the cameos that Alfred Hitchcock had done within his films .
Over time , Mario 's appearance has become more defined ; blue eyes , white gloves , brown shoes , a red " M " in a white circle on the front of his hat and gold buttons on his overalls have been added .
The colors of his shirt and overalls were also reversed from a blue shirt with red overalls to a red shirt with blue overalls .
Miyamoto attributed this process to the different development teams and artists for each game as well as advances in technology .
SURNAME Section::::Surname .
Nintendo did not initially reveal Mario 's full name .
In a 1989 interview , his full name was stated not to be " Mario Mario " though it may be inferred from the title of the Mario Bros. series .
The first notable use of " Mario Mario " is in the 1993 live - action film adaptation .
This was again used in two of Prima 's official strategy guides , in 2000 for Mario Party 2 and in 2003 for .
In 2012 after Charles Martinet voiced Mario declaring himself " Mario Mario " at the San Diego Comic - Con the next month
Satoru Iwata said he had no last name , which Shigeru Miyamoto agreed with the month after .
Two months after Iwata 's death in July 2015 , Miyamoto changed his stance September 2015 at the Super Mario Bros. 30th Anniversary festival , asserting that his name was indeed Mario Mario .

Mario 's most commonly portrayed form of attack is jumping to stomp on the heads of enemies , first used in
Super Mario Bros. This jump - stomp move may entirely crush smaller enemies on the stage , and usually deals damage to larger ones , sometimes causing secondary effects .
