PERMANENT TEETH
Permanent teeth or adult teeth are the second set of teeth formed in diphyodont mammals .
In humans and old world simians , there are thirty - two permanent teeth , consisting of six maxillary and six mandibular molars , four maxillary and four mandibular premolars , two maxillary and two mandibular canines , four maxillary and four mandibular incisors .
TIMELINE Section::::Timeline .
The first permanent tooth usually appears in the mouth at around six years of age , and the mouth will then be in a transition time with both primary ( or deciduous dentition ) teeth and permanent teeth during the mixed dentition period until the last primary tooth is lost or shed .
The first of the permanent teeth to erupt are the permanent first molars , right behind the last ' milk ' molars of the primary dentition .
These first permanent molars are important for the correct development of a permanent dentition .
Up to the age of thirteen years , twenty - eight of the thirty - two permanent teeth will appear .
The full permanent dentition is completed much later during the permanent dentition period .
The four last permanent teeth , the third molars , usually appear between the ages of 17 and 25 years ; they are considered wisdom teeth .
PATHOLOGY Section::::Pathology .
It is possible to have extra , or " supernumerary , " teeth .
This phenomenon is called hyperdontia and is often erroneously referred to as " a third set of teeth .
" These teeth may erupt into the mouth or remain impacted in the bone .
Hyperdontia is often associated with syndromes such as cleft lip and palate , trichorhinophalangeal syndrome , cleidocranial dysplasia , and Gardner 's syndrome .
