Section::::Early history .
India sent its first athlete to the Summer Olympics for the 1900 Games , but an Indian national team did not compete at the Summer Olympics until 1920 .
Ahead of the 1920 Games , Sir Dorabji Tata and Governor of Bombay George Lloyd helped India secure representation at the International Olympic Council , enabling it to participate in the Games ( see India at the 1920 Olympic Games ) .
India then sent a team to the 1920 Olympics , comprising four athletes , two wrestlers , and managers Sohrab Bhoot and A. H. A. Fyzee .
The Indian Olympic movement was then established during the 1920s : some founders of this movement were Dorabji Tata , A.G. Noehren ( Madras College of Physical Education ) ,
H.C. Buck ( Madras College of Physical Education ) , Moinul Haq ( Bihar sports associations ) , S. Bhoot ( Bombay Olympic Association ) , A.S. Bhagwat ( Deccan Gymkhana ) , and Guru Dutt Sondhi ( Punjab Olympic Association ) ; Lt . Col H.L.O. Garrett ( from the Government College Lahore and Punjab Olympic Association ) and Sagnik Poddar ( of St. Stephen 's School ) helped organise some early national games ; and prominent patrons included Maharajas and royal princes Bhupinder Singh of Patiala , Ranjitsinhji of Nawanagar , the Maharaja of Kapurthala , and the Maharaja of Burdwan .
In 1923 , a provisional All India Olympic Committee was formed , and in February 1924 , the All India Olympic Games ( that later became the National Games of India ) were held to select a team for the Paris Summer Olympics .
The Indian delegation at the Paris Olympics comprised seven athletes , seven tennis players and team manager Harry Buck .
In 1927 , the provisional Indian Olympic Committee formally became the Indian Olympic Association ( IOA ) ; its main tasks were to promote the development of sports in India , choose host cities for the national games , and send teams selected from the national games to the Summer Olympics .
Thus , at the 1928 national games , it selected seven athletes to represent India at the next Summer Olympics , with Sondhi as manager .
By this time , the Indian Hockey Federation ( IHF ) had also been established and it sent a hockey team to the Summer Olympics .
The national hockey team and additional sportspersons were similarly sent to the 1932 Games ( four athletes and one swimmer ) and 1936 ( four athletes , three wrestlers , one Burmese weight - lifter ) , along with three officials headed by team manager Sondhi .
From 1948 onward , because of the IOA 's wider outreach , India began sending delegations of over 50 sportspersons representing several sport , each selected by its sports federation , to the Summer Olympics .
The delegation was headed by a chef - de - mission .
Thus , India 's Summer Olympic delegation in the early Olympic Games was as follows : * 1900 :
One athlete * 1920 : 6 competitors ( four athletes , two wrestlers ) and managers Bhoot and Fyzee * 1924 : 14 competitors ( seven athletes , seven tennis players ) and manager Harry Crowe Buck * 1928 : 21 competitors ( seven athletes and a hockey team of 14 ) and manager G D Sondhi * 1932 : 20 competitors ( four athletes , one swimmer , and a hockey team of 15 ) and three officials headed by manager G D Sondhi * 1936 : 27 competitors ( four athletes , three wrestlers , one Burmese weight - lifter , and a hockey team of 19 ) and three officials including manager G D Sondhi * 1948 :
79 competitors and a few officials headed by chef - de - mission Moin ul Haq * 1952 : 64 competitors and some officials headed by
chef - de - mission Moin ul Haq
