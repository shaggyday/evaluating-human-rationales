THE WRECK OF THE TITAN :
OR , FUTILITY The Wreck of the Titan :
Or , Futility ( originally called Futility ) is an 1898 novella written by Morgan Robertson .
The story features the fictional ocean liner Titan , which sinks in the North Atlantic after striking an iceberg .
Titan and its sinking have been noted to be very similar to the real - life passenger ship , which sank fourteen years later .
Following the sinking of the Titanic , the novel was reissued with some changes , particularly in the ship 's gross tonnage .

In a brief final chapter covering several years , Rowland works his way up from homeless and anonymous fisherman to a desk job and finally , two years after passing his civil service exam , to " a lucrative position under the Government , and as he seated himself at the desk in his office , could have been heard to remark : ' Now John Rowland , your future is your own .
