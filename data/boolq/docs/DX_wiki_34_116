UNITED STATES HERALDRY Heraldry in the United States was first established by European settlers who brought with them the heraldic customs of their respective countries of origin .
As the use of coats of arms may be seen as a custom of royalty and nobility , it had been debated whether the use of arms is reconcilable with American republican traditions .
Families from English , Scottish , Irish , Welsh , German , and other European nations with a heraldic tradition have retained their familial coat of arms in the United States .
Several founding fathers also employed personal arms and a great number of Americans continue to do so .
USAGE OF ARMS Section::::Usage of arms .
Most states do not employ coats of arms , but have chosen to use seals as their official emblems , but the United States has a coat of arms .
The U.S. Constitution prohibits federal and state governments from conferring titles of nobility ( see Title of Nobility Clause ) and there are few noble coats of arms in the country .
However private persons , including several past presidents , employ coats of arms either granted to them , or which they inherited .
Since there is no official regulation on arms , except for the official seals , badges , insignia , decorations and medals of the country and the states , many private individuals have assumed arms , in addition to those who inherited them , or had them granted by or registered in another country .
There is one anomalous exception to this lack of regulation : the coat of arms of the Swiss Confederation is specifically protected from unauthorized use within the U.S. , under penalty of a fine and/or imprisonment for up to six months .
U.S. ARMY INSTITUTE OF HERALDRY Section::::U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry .
Heraldic and other military symbols have been used by the military forces as well as other organizational elements of the government since the beginning of the Revolution .
However , until 1919 , there was no coordinated , overall military symbolism program .
In that year , within the War Department General Staff , an office was delegated the responsibility for the coordination and approval of coats of arms and insignia of certain Army organizations .
In 1924 , formal staff responsibility for specific military designs was delegated to The Quartermaster General .
As the needs for symbolism by the military services and the national government expanded , the scope of the services furnished by The Quartermaster General 's Office evolved into a sizable heraldic program .
The acceleration of activities brought about by World War II , the expansion of the Army , and subsequent increase of interest in symbolism , contributed to the growth of the program .
In 1949 , the Munitions Board , acting for the Army , Navy and Air Force , directed the Army to provide heraldic services to all military departments .
The program was expanded further as a result of the enactment of Public Law 85 - 263 , approved September 1957 , 71 Stat .
589 , which delineates the authority of the Secretary of the Army to furnish heraldic services to the military departments and other branches of the federal government .
The Institute of Heraldry was established in 1960 at Cameron Station in Alexandria , Virginia .
Within the Institute , functions formerly performed within the Office of The Quartermaster General and several field activities were consolidated .
Upon reorganization of the Army in 1962 , responsibility for the Heraldic Program was assigned to The Adjutant General 's Office .
In 1987 , with the realignment of certain Army Staff agency functions , the Institute was transferred to the United States Army Human Resources Command .
In April 1994 , The Institute of Heraldry was relocated from Cameron Station to Fort Belvoir , Virginia .
As a result of a realignment in October 2004 , responsibility for the Heraldic Program was assigned to The Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army , Resources and Programs Agency .
The U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry consists of a staff of twenty civilians .
The mission of the Institute is to furnish heraldic services to the Armed Forces and other United States government organizations , including the Executive Office of the President .
The activities of the Institute encompass research , design , development , standardization , quality control , and other services relating to official symbolic items — seals , decorations , medals , insignia , badges , flags , and other items awarded to or authorized for official wear or display by government personnel and agencies .
Limited research and information services concerning official symbolic items are also provided to the general public .
