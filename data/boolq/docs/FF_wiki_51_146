EXTERNAL COMPRESSION HEADACHE External Compression Headache is caused by any type of headwear .
This includes headwear that places pressure on the head â€” including tight hats , helmets , headbands , headphones and goggles .
It is not known why some people are more sensitive than others to this type of pressure .
External compression headaches can affect anyone who uses headwear .
The headaches are more common among people who have migraines .
It is believed to affect about four percent of the population .
It is also referred to as " swim goggle headache " .
These headaches can be brought on by such innocuous sources as wearing a halter top ( presses against the neck ) , earplugs ( presses against the jaw and inner ear ) , or wearing even a tiny hair clip ( compresses the scalp ) .
There is no known preventative treatment except to avoid the offending trigger .
However , once symptoms arise and the trigger is removed , " Triptan"-type migraine treatment is effective .
