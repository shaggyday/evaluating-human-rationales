SERIES OVERVIEW
Section::::Series overview .
The series is set in the fictional town of Mystic Falls , Virginia , a town charged with supernatural history since its settlement of migrants from New England in the late 19th century .
It follows the life of Elena Gilbert ( Nina Dobrev ) , a teenage girl who has just lost both parents in a car accident , as she falls in love with a 162-year - old vampire named Stefan Salvatore ( Paul Wesley ) .
Their relationship becomes increasingly complicated as Stefan 's mysterious older brother Damon Salvatore ( Ian Somerhalder ) returns , with a plan to bring back their past love Katherine Pierce , a vampire who looks exactly like Elena .
Although Damon is initially the villain and harbors a grudge against his brother for forcing him to become a vampire , he later reconciles with Stefan and falls in love with Elena , creating a love triangle among the three .
Both brothers protect Elena as they face various villains and threats to their town , including Katherine .
The brothers ' history and the town 's mythology are revealed through flashbacks as the series goes on .
Additional storylines revolve around the other inhabitants of the town , most notably Elena 's younger brother Jeremy Gilbert
( Steven R. McQueen ) , her best friends Bonnie Bennett ( Kat Graham ) and Caroline Forbes ( Candice King ) , their mutual friends Tyler Lockwood ( Michael Trevino ) and Matt Donovan ( Zach Roerig ) , and their history teacher , vampire hunter Alaric Saltzman ( Matthew Davis ) .
The town 's politics are orchestrated by descendants of the original founding families , all comprising a " Founders ' Council .
" The founding families of Mystic Falls include the Salvatores , the Gilberts , the Fells , the Forbes , and the Lockwoods .
They guard the town mainly from vampires , although there are many more supernatural threats such as werewolves , witches , hybrids , and ghosts .

EPISODES
PRODUCTION Section::::Production .
Initially , Kevin Williamson had little interest in developing the series , finding the premise too similar to other vampire tales .
However , at the urging of Julie Plec , he began to read the novels and started to become intrigued by the story : " I began to realize that it was a story about a small town , about that town 's underbelly and about what lurks under the surface .
"
Williamson has stated the town 's story will be the main focus of the series rather than high school .
On February 6 , 2009 , Variety announced that The CW had green - lit the pilot for The Vampire Diaries with Williamson and Julie Plec set as the head writers and executive producers .
On May 19 , 2009 , the series was officially ordered for the 2009–2010 season .

On the morning of May 10 , 2012 , a fire broke out in the building on Clark Street in Covington that was used as the setting for Mystic Grill on the show .
The series was given a full 22-episode order on October 21 , 2009 , after strong ratings for the first half of the season .
