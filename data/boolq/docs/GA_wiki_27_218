In addition , Larry Miller reprised his role as the overprotective father , Walter Stratford .
A cover of I Want You to Want Me by Cheap Trick ( which was covered for the film by Letters to Cleo )
was recorded by KSM .
A music video was shot which featured members of the cast with KSM .
The pilot was shot at a high school in Tujunga , California .
Due to budget constraints , future episodes were filmed at a soundstage in Santa Clarita , California , with only occasional external shots in Tujunga .
Covington served as the series ' showrunner , as well as an executive producer .
He stated that he wanted the show " to feel like a John Hughes film every week . "
Junger remained on board , and directed seven of the first 10 episodes of the series .
