PLOT Section::::Plot .
Troublemaker student Sebastian Valmont ( Robin Dunne ) is transferring to Manchester Prep following his father 's new marriage to a wealthy divorcee .
His current principal is insistent on having Sebastian 's permanent record relayed to his new school , thereby hampering his chance for a fresh start , but Sebastian already retaliated by pulling a cruel stunt on his wife .
Following his arrival in New York , Sebastian discovers the wealth of his new family and first meets his deceitful and determined step - sister Kathryn Merteuil ( Amy Adams ) .
Sebastian quickly proves to be able to better her both at piano and vocabulary .
This leads to a confrontation between Kathryn and Sebastian whereby she states that she has a comfortable lifestyle and that he " better not interfere " .
Sebastian begins school .
While waiting to see his new headmaster , he encounters Danielle Sherman ( Sarah Thompson ) , who is , unbeknownst to him , Headmaster Sherman 's daughter .
Luckily , Sebastian swapped his permanent record for an excelling one before it was sent to the headmaster 's office , and he can now start over with a clean slate .
A school assembly follows , showing Kathryn delivering a speech to her classmates , but being persistently interrupted by uncontrollable hiccups coming from a student , who then begins to choke on the gum that she was chewing in a bid to stop her hiccups .
She is saved by the quick action of Danielle who performs the Heimlich maneuver , allowing the student to expel the gum , which ends up flying into Kathryn 's hair .
A meeting of a secret society of student elites presided by Kathryn takes place , deciding upon the fate of the new students .
This leads them to Cherie , the student with the hiccups , as well as the discovery that Cherie 's family is wealthier than that of Kathryn ; this , along with the events of the assembly , causes Kathryn to seek a vendetta against Cherie .
Sebastian , coming from a more humble upbringing , wishes to befriend his house staff .
Doing so angers
Kathryn , whose day is interrupted by not being able to contact her driver .
This , combined with Kathryn 's jealousy of Sebastian , causes her to admit that she is unhappy with her life .
Sebastian attempts to woo Danielle : first , asking her for coffee at her work ; then later , conversing with her over the telephone .
Eventually , this evolves into a relationship , but Kathryn , seeing this , uses it as a way to get back at Sebastian .
She tries to lure him away from Danielle by tempting him with identical twins , who confide to Sebastian that Danielle is the only virgin at Manchester .
Kathryn 's attempt to sabotage Cherie backfires , as Kathryn 's mother tells her to become best friends with Cherie , in an attempt to encourage Cherie 's mother to donate a large amount of money to the school .
In the end , Sebastian stays with Danielle ; he professes his love for her , only to find that she does not reciprocate .
It turns out that Danielle is actually working alongside Kathryn in a secret plan to dupe Sebastian .
Defeated by Kathryn 's manipulation , Sebastian states " if you ca n't beat them , join them " , thus leading to a threesome with Danielle and Kathryn , followed by an alliance of the three to dominate and manipulate others .
