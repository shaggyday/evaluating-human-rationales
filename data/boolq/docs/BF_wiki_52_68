EUROPEAN CHAMPION CLUBS ' CUP
The European Champion Clubs ' Cup , also known as Coupe des Clubs Champions Européens , or simply the European Cup , is a trophy awarded annually by UEFA to the football club that wins the UEFA Champions League .
The competition in its older format shared its name with the trophy , being also known as the European Cup , before being renamed for the 1992–93 season onwards .
Several different physical trophies have had the name , as a club was entitled to keep the cup after five wins or three consecutive wins , with a new cup having to be forged for the following season .
THE TROPHY Section::::The trophy .
The original European Cup trophy was donated by L'Équipe , a French sports newspaper .
This trophy was awarded permanently to Real Madrid in March 1967 .
At the time , they were the reigning champions , and had won six titles altogether , including the first five competitions from 1956 to 1960 .
Celtic therefore became the first club to win the cup in its current design in 1967 .
The replacement trophy , with a somewhat different design from the original , was commissioned by UEFA from Jörg Stadelmann , a jeweller from Bern , Switzerland .
At a cost of 10,000 Swiss francs , it was silver , 74 cm high , weighing 11 kg .
The trophy bears the title " COUPE DES CLUBS CHAMPIONS EUROPÉENS ' " .
Subsequent replacement trophies have replicated this design .
The shape of the handles have earned it the nickname of " big ears " in multiple languages , including French ( " la Coupe aux grandes oreilles " ) and Spanish ( " La Orejona " ) .
The trophy that currently is awarded is the sixth and has been in use since 2006 , after Liverpool won their fifth European Cup in 2005 .
Since 2009 , Champions League winners have not kept the real trophy , which remains in UEFA 's keeping at all times .
A full - size replica trophy , the Champions League winners trophy , is awarded to the winning club with their name engraved on it .
Winning clubs are also permitted to make replicas of their own ; however , they must be clearly marked as such and can be a maximum of eighty percent the size of the actual trophy .
The previous rule introduced before the 1968–69 season , allowed a club to keep the trophy after five wins or three consecutive wins .
At that point , Real Madrid was the only club meeting either qualification and indeed met both .
Once a club had been awarded the trophy , the count was reset to zero .
For example , a club with no prior titles which won six titles in a row would have been permanently awarded trophies after the third and sixth wins ( each for three - in - a - row ) but not after their fifth win .
A club whose Champions League title win was not a fifth overall or third consecutive previously kept the real trophy for ten months after their victory and received a scaled - down replica to keep permanently .
Since 2009 , the real trophy remains with UEFA at all times , but the winning club now receives a full - sized replica with their name engraved on it .
CLUBS AWARDED THE TROPHY PERMANENTLY
Section::::Clubs awarded the trophy permanently .
Five clubs have kept the real trophy under the old rules from the 1968–69 to 2008–09 seasons : * Real Madrid , after their sixth title in 1966 .
* Ajax , after their third consecutive title in 1973 .
* Bayern Munich , after their third consecutive title in 1976 .
* Milan , after their fifth title in 1994 .
* Liverpool , after their fifth title in 2005 .
MULTIPLE - WINNER BADGE Section::::Multiple - winner badge .
The multiple - winner badge , was introduced for the start of the 2000–01 competition for clubs that kept the trophy permanently .
The badge itself adorns the left sleeve of the team 's shirt during Champions League matches .
The original badge was a blue oval on which was an outline of the current trophy in white , overlaid with part of the Champions League starball logo .
Above the trophy was the total number of titles held by the club .
From 2012 , the badge became grey with a new design .
Because the current trophy permanently remains UEFA property , it is no longer given to a team that wins a fifth overall or third consecutive title .
However , the multiple - winner badge is still awarded to such clubs .
Liverpool therefore became the last ever team to be permanently awarded the trophy .
Six teams have won five overall or three consecutive titles : * Real Madrid ( 5 consecutive , 3 consecutive and 13 overall ) *
Ajax ( 3 consecutive and 4 overall )
* Bayern Munich ( 3 consecutive and 5 overall )
*
Milan ( 7 overall )
* Liverpool ( 5 overall )
* Barcelona ( 5 overall ) TITLE - HOLDER LOGO Section::::Title - holder logo .
A separate " title - holder logo " is worn by the reigning Champions League champions in the following season 's competition in place of the regular patch worn by the other competing teams .
The logo is predominantly dark blue and was introduced in 2004–05 , with Porto as the defending champions .
The distinction between the title - holder logo and the badge of honour can be compared to the distinction between the Scudetto ( " shield " ) worn by the reigning Serie A champions in Italy , and the stella ( " star " ) worn by teams with over ten Serie A titles in total .
However , whereas Juventus wear three stars as they have won over 30 titles , there is no provision for multiple UEFA badges of honour , as the count within the badge can be incremented indefinitely .
From 2006–07 to 2010–11 , the title holders also played with the match ball used in their triumphant final in their home matches , but from 2011–12 , the title holders use the same match ball as the 31 other teams .
The original design for the title - holder badge featured two of the interconnecting stars of the competition 's star ball logo at the top , with the caption " champions " and the season of triumph in the centre of the badge .
It was slightly modified in 2008–09 to feature the entirety of the star ball logo , albeit with the other stars faded out , and it was drastically changed for the 2009–10 competition .
Without the star ball background , it instead featured a design of the trophy which was used for the branding of the previous season 's final .
It was revamped again in 2010–11 to feature part of the star ball on show below the " champions " caption and the year of triumph .
The current design was first worn by Chelsea in 2012–13 ; it features an outline design of the trophy along with the year of triumph .
