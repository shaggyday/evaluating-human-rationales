YEAR ZERO
Year zero does not exist in the anno Domini system usually used to number years in the Gregorian calendar and in its predecessor , the Julian calendar .
In this system , the year is followed by .
However , there is a year zero in astronomical year numbering ( where it coincides with the Julian year ) and in ISO 8601:2004 ( where it coincides with the Gregorian year ) as well as in all Buddhist and Hindu calendars .

NUMBERING SYSTEMS

Section::::Historians .
The Anno Domini era was introduced in 525 by Scythian monk Dionysius Exiguus (
c. 470–c . 544 ) , who used it to identify the years on his Easter table .
He introduced the new era to avoid using the Diocletian era , based on the accession of Roman Emperor Diocletian , as he did not wish to continue the memory of a persecutor of Christians .
In the preface to his Easter table , Dionysius stated that the " present year " was " the consulship of Probus Junior [ Flavius Anicius Probus Iunior ] " which was also 525 years " since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ " .
How he arrived at that number is unknown .
Dionysius did not use AD years to date any historical event .
This began with the English cleric Bede ( c. 672–735 ) , who used AD years in his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum ( 731 ) , popularizing the era .
Bede also used a term similar to the English before Christ once , but that practice did not catch on until very much later .
Bede did not sequentially number days of the month , weeks of the year , or months of the year .
However , he did number many of the days of the week using a counting origin of one in Ecclesiastical Latin .
Previous Christian histories used anno mundi ( " in the year of the world " ) beginning on the first day of creation , or anno Adami ( " in the year of Adam " ) beginning at the creation of Adam five days later ( the sixth day of creation according to the Genesis creation narrative ) , used by Africanus , or anno Abrahami ( " in the year of Abraham " ) beginning 3,412 years after Creation according to the Septuagint , used by Eusebius of Caesarea , all of which assigned " one " to the year beginning at Creation , or the creation of Adam , or the birth of Abraham , respectively .
Bede continued this earlier tradition relative to the AD era .
In chapter II of book
I of Ecclesiastical history , Bede stated that Julius Caesar invaded Britain " in the year 693 after the building of Rome , but the sixtieth year before the incarnation of our Lord " , while stating in chapter III , " in the year of Rome 798 , Claudius " also invaded Britain and " within a very few days [ ...
] concluded the war in [ ... ]
the fortysixth [ year ] from the incarnation of our Lord " .
Although both dates are wrong , they are sufficient to conclude that Bede did not include a year zero between BC and AD : 798 − 693 + 1 ( because the years are inclusive ) =
106 , but 60 + 46 = 106 , which leaves no room for a year zero .
The modern English term " before Christ " ( BC ) is only a rough equivalent , not a direct translation , of Bede 's Latin phrase ante incarnationis dominicae tempus ( " before the time of the lord 's incarnation " ) , which was itself never abbreviated .
Bede 's singular use of ' BC ' continued to be used sporadically throughout the Middle Ages .
Neither the concept nor a symbol for zero existed in the system of Roman numerals .
The Babylonian system of the BC era had used the idea of " nothingness " without considering it a number , and the Romans enumerated in much the same way .
Wherever a modern zero would have been used , Bede and Dionysius Exiguus did use Latin number words , or the word nulla ( meaning " nothing " ) alongside Roman numerals .
Zero was invented in India in the sixth century , and was either transferred or reinvented by the Arabs by about the eighth century .
The Arabic numeral for zero ( 0 ) did not enter Europe until the thirteenth century .
Even then , it was known only to very few , and only entered widespread use in Europe by the seventeenth century .
The anno Domini nomenclature was not widely used in Western Europe until the 9th century , and the to historical year was not uniform throughout Western Europe until 1752 .
The first extensive use ( hundreds of times ) of ' BC ' occurred in Fasciculus Temporum by Werner Rolevinck in 1474 , alongside years of the world ( anno mundi ) .
The terms anno Domini , Dionysian era , Christian era , vulgar era , and common era were used interchangeably between the Renaissance and the 19th century , at least in Latin .
But vulgar era was suppressed in English at the beginning of the 20th century after vulgar acquired the meaning of " offensively coarse " , replacing its original meaning of " common " or " ordinary " .
Consequently , historians regard all these eras as equal .
Historians have never included a year zero .
This means that between , for example , and , there are 999 years : 500 years BC , and 499 years AD preceding 500 .
In common usage anno Domini 1 is preceded by the year 1 BC , without an intervening year zero .
Neither the choice of calendar system ( whether Julian or Gregorian ) nor the era ( Anno Domini or Common Era ) determines whether a year zero will be used .
If writers do not use the convention of their group ( historians or astronomers ) , they must explicitly state whether they include a year 0 in their count of years , otherwise their historical dates will be misunderstood .
ASTRONOMERS Section::::Astronomers .
In astronomy , for the year AD 1 and later it is common to assign the same numbers as the Anno Domini notation , which in turn is numerically equivalent to the Common Era notation .
But the discontinuity between 1 AD and 1 BC makes it cumbersome to compare ancient and modern dates .
So the year before 1 AD is designated 0 , the year before 0 is −1 , and so on .
The letters " AD " , " BC " , " CE , or " BCE " are omitted .
So 1 BC in historical notation is equivalent to 0 in astronomical notation , 2 BC is equivalent to −1 , etc .
Sometimes positive years are preceded by the + sign .
This year numbering notation was introduced by the astronomer Jacques Cassini in 1740 .
HISTORY OF ASTRONOMICAL USAGE Section::::History of astronomical usage .
In 1627 , the German astronomer Johannes Kepler first used an astronomical year which was to become year zero in his Rudolphine Tables .
He labeled the year Christi and inserted it between years labeled Ante Christum ( BC ) and Post Christum ( AD ) on the mean motion pages of the Sun , Moon , and planets .
Then in 1702 the French astronomer Philippe de la Hire used a year he labeled at the end of years labeled ante Christum ( BC ) , immediately before years labeled post Christum ( AD ) on the mean motion pages in his Tabulæ Astronomicæ , thus adding the designation 0 to Kepler 's Christi .
Finally , in 1740 the French astronomer Jacques Cassini , who is traditionally credited with the invention of year zero , completed the transition in his Tables astronomiques , simply labeling this year 0 , which he placed at the end of years labeled avant Jesus - Christ ( BC ) , immediately before years labeled après Jesus - Christ ( AD ) .
ISO 8601 Section::::ISO 8601 .
ISO 8601:2004 ( and previously ISO 8601:2000 , but not ISO 8601:1988 ) explicitly uses astronomical year numbering in its date reference systems .
Because it also specifies the use of the proleptic Gregorian calendar for all years before 1582 , some readers incorrectly assume that a year zero is also included in that proleptic calendar , but it is not used with the BC / AD era .
The " basic " format for year 0 is the four - digit form 0000 , which equals the historical year 1 BC .
Several " expanded " formats are possible :
−0000 and +0000 , as well as five- and six - digit versions .
Earlier years are also negative four- , five- or six - digit years , which have an absolute value one less than the equivalent BC year , hence -0001 =
2 BC .
Because only ISO 646 ( 7-bit ASCII ) characters are allowed by ISO 8601 , the minus sign is represented by a hyphen - minus .
OTHER TRADITIONS
SOUTH ASIAN CALENDARS
Section::::Other traditions .
Section::::South Asian calendars .
All eras used with Hindu and Buddhist calendars , such as the Saka era or the Kali Yuga , begin with the year 0 .
All these calendars use elapsed , expired , or complete years , in contrast with most other calendars which use current years .
A complete year had not yet elapsed for any date in the initial year of the epoch , thus the number 1 can not be used .
Instead , during the first year the indication of 0 years ( elapsed ) is given in order to show that the epoch is less than 1 year old .
This is similar to the Western method of stating a person 's age – people do not reach age one until one year has elapsed since birth ( but their age during the year beginning at birth is specified in months or fractional years , not as age zero ) .
However , if ages were specified in years and months , such a person would be said to be , for example , 0 years and 6 months or 0.5 years old .
This is analogous to the way time is shown on a 24-hour clock : during the first hour of a day , the time elapsed is 0 hours , n minutes .
