PLOT Section::::Plot .
While climbing in Monument Valley , siblings Peter ( O'Donnell ) and Annie Garrett ( Tunney ) lose their father , Royce ( Stuart Wilson ) : after two falling amateurs leave the family dangling , Royce forces Peter to cut him loose to save Peter and his sister .
Peter has since retired from climbing and become a full - time wildlife photographer , and Annie has gone on to become a renowned mountain climber .
Their relationship is strained , as Annie still blames Peter for obeying Royce instead of waiting for her to secure the rope .
Three years later , during a wildlife photo shoot for National Geographic , in the lower Himalayas in Pakistan , Peter 's assistant falls , breaks his leg , and has to be evacuated by the Pakistani Army stationed in a military station that monitors avalanches .
Peter is dropped off at K2 Base Camp and searches for Annie , who is planning a summit attempt on K2 , the world 's second highest and most dangerous mountain .
The expedition is funded by wealthy industrialist Elliot Vaughn ( Paxton ) , who is also taking part .
( He wants to attempt climbing the K2 for the second time , as his first attempt ended in tragedy with him as sole survivor . )
Vaughn has the help of renowned climber Tom McLaren ( Nicholas Lea ) ; other expedition members include Pakistani mountaineer Ali Nazir .
The day before the climb Vaughn throws a promotional party with all the people at base camp .
The gala is interrupted by reclusive Montgomery Wick ( Glenn ) , reportedly the world 's best climber and K2 foremost expert , who asks if it will be Vaughn or the experienced McLaren who will be making the decisions during the climb , as the team can not have two leaders .
Vaughn states that McLaren is the leader and later explains that Wick is against him because his wife , a Sherpa guide , was one of the people who did not survive his previous expedition .
During that climb , they were hit by a storm and got lost in the mountain .
Wick 's wife died of pulmonary edema on their way down because she forgot her supply of dexamethasone , the only medicine capable of preventing it .
Wick has never believed that story and has spent years trying to find his wife 's body .
The climb turns out to be a disaster , as Vaughn forces McLaren to continue despite the radio warning from base camp director Skip Taylor ( Robert Taylor ) of a storm approaching .
As the storm closes in , the winds begin to wreak havoc and cause an avalanche .
Annie , Vaughn , and McLaren fall through a patch of ice and become trapped in a crevasse , while the other expedition members are killed .
Radio contact is lost , but Peter remains by the radio and hears Annie using static to send a Morse code signal to inform base camp that they are alive .
Peter manages to assemble a rescue mission with some of the climbers at base camp , including base camp director Skip Taylor , brothers Cyril and Malcolm ( Le Marquand and Mendelsohn ) , who are experienced climbers looking for adventure , Monique Aubertine ( Izabella Scorupco ) , who needs the money from the reward offered by Vaughn 's company , and Kareem Nazir ( Alexander Siddig ) , who is Ali 's cousin and wants to help even if he knows that his cousin is already dead .
Skip and Peter also visit Wick , who agrees to join in the rescue attempt but requests that Skip remain behind , as Wick says that he needs someone he can trust at base camp directing the mission .
The teams form , pairing experienced mountaineers with less experienced ones : Malcolm and Kareem , Cyril and Monique , and Wick and Peter .
After an eventful helicopter drop - off , each team takes a different entry point up the mountain to increase chances of success .
They each carry an old canister of nitroglycerine donated by the Pakistani Army to clear out the entrance to the crevasse .
Monique and Cyril encounter trouble when Cyril loses his balance and clings to the side of a cliff .
After Monique secures her harness to him , the peak cracks , and Monique also falls over the edge .
Their leaky nitro canisters explode beneath them while they hang from ropes .
Cyril is able to climb back up , but an avalanche caused by the explosion throws him over the edge again , without a rope this time .
Monique , who survives because she was still under the cliff 's edge , pulls herself up despite several broken fingers , and radios base camp that Cyril has been killed .
Back at the military station , the nitroglycerine canisters are exposed to sunlight and explode .
Base camp tells the teams to get their cases of nitroglycerin into the shade .
Kareem and Malcolm do so , but , while resting after covering the cases , the leaked nitroglycerin is eventually exposed to sunlight and explodes , killing the two .
Meanwhile underground , McLaren is severely injured , with a broken leg and ribs , and he has lost his dexamethasone .
Annie shares her dex with him , but Vaughn refuses it , stating that every climber should take care of his / her own supply or risk death .
Annie risks her life to reach Ali 's body and backpack , and manages to obtain additional dex for both McLaren and herself , but Vaughn tells her that McLaren is unlikely to survive , and therefore , they should keep all the dex for themselves .
The nitro explosions have shaken loose some ice , and Wick finally discovers his wife 's body in a glacier .
The empty dex box near his wife 's suggests that Vaughn lied and stole her dex , thus ensuring his own survival while leaving her behind to die from pulmonary edema .
Monique joins up with Peter and Wick , and the three spend the night on the mountain .
Peter is wary of Wick , fearing he might be more intent on taking revenge than in rescuing his sister .
Meanwhile in the crevasse , Annie falls asleep , and Vaughn kills McLaren with a dex syringe full of air to save the remaining dex for himself .
Annie suspects Vaughn but decides not to confront him and instead to save her strength , as she is already suffering from pulmonary edema .
Wick awakens to find that Peter and Monique have gone already towards their destination , leaving him behind as they no longer trust him .
Peter signals Annie their position , and Annie and Vaughn manage to mark the crevasse entrance by launching a homemade flare and using McLaren 's blood as paint .
Peter and Monique use the nitroglycerin to blast a hole , enabling access to the survivors and are joined by Wick , who promises Peter that he will rescue Annie .
Wick descends into the cave and harnesses Annie , and although the weakened Vaughn thinks he is about to attack him , Wick attaches a harness to him as well .
Wick and Peter attempt to pull Annie out of the crevasse , but an ice boulder falls , knocking Wick and Vaughn from the ledge in the crevice , and pulling Annie and Peter down .
Monique alone remains on the ledge holding the rope onto which the other four are hanging .
To save Annie and Peter , and to fulfill his revenge on Vaughn , Wick pulls a knife from his pocket , says a Buddhist prayer , and cuts the rope holding himself and Vaughn dropping the two to their deaths .
Recovering at base camp , Annie reconciles with Peter , who finally pays his respects at a memorial for those killed on K2 , including Kareem , his cousin Ali , Cyril , Malcolm , Tom McLaren , Wick , and his wife .
