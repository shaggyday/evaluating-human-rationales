By the end of the 19th century , the bank was represented in all of the Maritimes , Quebec , Ontario , and Manitoba .
In 1900 , the bank moved its headquarters to Toronto , Ontario .

CONTROVERSIES
WRONGFUL
DISMISSAL LAWSUIT Section::::Controversies .
Section::::Wrongful dismissal lawsuit .
In June 2005 , David Berry , a very successful Canadian Scotiabank trader who had built a $ 75M / year business in trading preferred shares , was fired on the grounds that he had committed securities regulatory violations .
At the time , as part of a 20 % direct drive deal , he was making more than double the CEO 's salary and Scotiabank management had already taken steps to limit his compensation .
The regulatory violation allegations from his former employer , left him unemployable to Scotiabank 's competitors despite the appeal of potentially adding more than $ 75M / year to their equity trading profits .
Documents delivered to the media showing that Scotiabank management had sought advice on terminating Berry prior to the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada ( IIROC ) violation accusation , and the results of questioning during the IIROC inquiries strongly suggest that the securities charges were part of a plan by Scotiabank senior management to remove Berry from his position and simultaneously prevent him from becoming their competitor .
In a ruling on January 15 , 2013 , more than seven years after the initial accusation , a hearing panel of the IIROC dismissed all charges against Berry .
David Berry filed a $ 100 M wrongful dismissal lawsuit against Scotiabank .
As of January 2015 , and nine years after Berry was terminated , Scotiabank settled with Berry for an undisclosed amount .
Barry Critchley , who followed the story since its beginning , wrote an article on November 6 , 2014 , in which he believes Scotiabank 's $ 55 million reported legal charges would likely be connected to the $ 100 million lawsuit ; but it is unlikely to ever be known .
UNPAID OVERTIME LAWSUIT Section::::Unpaid overtime lawsuit .
In 2014 , the bank reached a settlement in a class - action lawsuit that covered thousands of workers owed more than a decade of unpaid overtime .
The lawsuit included 16,000 Scotiabank employees across Canada who worked as personal banking officers , senior personal banking officers , financial advisors , and small business account managers from January 1 , 2000 , to December 1 , 2013 .
The 2007 lawsuit was similar to a class - action filed by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ( CIBC ) bank teller Dara Fresco of Toronto .
Under terms of the settlement , employees received 1.5 times their standard wage at the time , but no interest .
Scotiabank also paid legal fees of $ 10.45 million .
Plaintiffs ' counsels were David O'Connor of Roy O'Connor and Louis Sokolov of Sotos LLP .
FRAUD IN MEXICO Section::::Fraud in Mexico .
A 2001 investigation into the murder of Maru Oropesa , a Scotiabank branch manager in Mexico City revealed US$ 14 million missing from the branch .
Initially , investigators found that Oropesa and Jaime Ross , her former boss , had illegally transferred US$ 5 million from client investment accounts .
The money was eventually transferred to the United States where it was used to purchase three aircraft .
As the investigation continued , officials found an additional $ 9 million missing and involvement of 16 other bank employees in the fraud .
Ross was convicted of fraud and money laundering for his role and sentenced to 15 years .
Scotiabank terminated the other 16 employees , but did not prosecute them .
