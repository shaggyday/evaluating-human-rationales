PLOT Section::::Plot .
Childhood friends Dan Walker and Joe Lynch , along with Dan 's girlfriend Parker O'Neil , spend a Sunday afternoon at a New England ski resort on Mount Holliston .
They are eager to take one last run down the mountain before they go home ; however , the ski resort decides to close early because a storm is moving in .
The friends convince the ski lift attendant to let them on one last time .
Before the group gets all the way to the top , the attendant is called into the boss 's office and is replaced by a co - worker .
As he leaves , he tells the co - worker that there are only three skiers left .
Another set of three skiers comes down the mountain .
When he sees them , he shuts down the ski lift , stranding the three friends in their ski lift chair far above the ground .
They take it as a joke , but the ski resort 's lights are then turned off , leaving the three friends in fear and shock .
Parker knows the ski slopes have closed for the week .
Dan feels he has no choice but to jump from the ski lift chair and get help , as they will not survive up there in the bitter cold until Friday .
After discussing the danger , Dan decides to jump off the lift .
Upon hitting the ground , he suffers a compound fracture on both of his legs .
Soon , his screams and the scent of blood attracts a pack of wolves .
Joe , now fearing for Dan 's safety , decides to try to get to the ground by traversing the suspension cable between the lifts and steel support tower .
However , as wolves close in on Dan , he returns to the chair and holds Parker as Dan is brutally torn apart by the wolves .
In the morning , Parker awakes with her hand frozen on the bar , which she grabbed during her sleep .
She is also suffering severe frostbite .
Joe discusses his previous life experiences with her , before attempting to traverse the ski lift cable , and onto a support pole on the other side .
By doing this , he also causes the chair Parker is sitting in to dangerously loosen from the cable .
After scaring off a pair of wolves by using a ski pole , he slides down the mountain on Parker 's snowboard , planning to return with help .
The wolves give chase after him .
Joe never returns and Parker spends the night alone on the loose cable .
The next day , Parker begins to climb out of the lift , but the screw comes loose and causes the lift to fall .
Blocked by a cable , the lift is hanging a few meters above the ground .
Parker jumps and then the lift lands on her ankle .
Injured , she begins to slide and crawl down the mountain .
She encounters the wolves feasting on Joe 's mutilated corpse .
Too occupied with Joe 's corpse , they ignore her as she continues down , eventually crawling to a nearby road .
The first car that passes does n't see her but soon a minivan appears and the driver , seeing her outstretched body lying in the snow along the side of the road , stops to assist her .
The film ends with the driver saying they are going to a nearby hospital , followed by Parker closing her eyes .

RECEPTION CRITICAL Section::::Reception .
Section::::Critical .
Rotten Tomatoes , a review aggregator , reports that 62 % of 91 surveyed critics gave it a positive review , and the average rating was 5.8/10 ; the site 's consensus is : " Writer / director Adam Green has the beginnings of an inventive , frightening yarn in Frozen , but neither the script nor the cast are quite strong enough to truly do it justice . "
Critic Richard Roeper called the film " an entertaining , suspense - filled , sometimes wonderfully grotesque little scarefest " , though The Hollywood Reporter commented that it " is not written , directed , or acted well enough to be a first - rate thriller " .
Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times made it a NYT Critics ' Pick and wrote , " A minimalist setup delivers maximum fright in Frozen , a nifty little chiller that balances its cold terrain with an unexpectedly warm heart . "
Peter Debruge of Variety wrote , " Do n't be surprised if the movie 's most wince - inducing moments come not from the " disturbing images " ( as the MPAA describes the sight of a leg bone sticking six inches out of one character 's ski pants ) but rather of the bad acting and worse dialogue . "
AWARDS Section::::Awards .
It was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Horror Film , but lost to Drag Me to Hell .
