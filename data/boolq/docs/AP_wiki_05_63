PETER , PAUL AND MARY Peter , Paul and Mary was an American folk group formed in New York City in 1961 , during the American folk music revival phenomenon .
The trio was composed of tenor Peter Yarrow , baritone Noel Paul Stookey and alto Mary Travers .
The group 's repertoire included songs written by Yarrow and Stookey , early songs by Bob Dylan as well as covers of other folk musicians .
After the death of Travers in 2009 , Yarrow and Stookey continued to perform as a duo under their individual names .
Mary Travers said she was influenced by Woody Guthrie , Pete Seeger , and the Weavers .
In the documentary Peter , Paul & Mary : Carry It On —
A Musical Legacy members of the Weavers discuss how Peter , Paul and Mary took over the torch of the social commentary of folk music in the 1960s .
The group was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999 .
Peter , Paul and Mary received the Sammy Cahn Lifetime Achievement Award from Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2006 .
HISTORY EARLY YEARS ( 1961–1969 )
Section::::History .
Section::::Early years ( 1961–1969 ) .
Manager Albert Grossman created Peter , Paul and Mary in 1961 , after auditioning several singers in the New York folk scene , including Dave Van Ronk , who was rejected as too idiosyncratic and uncommercial , and Carolyn Hester .
After rehearsing Yarrow , Stookey and Travers out of town in Boston and Miami , Grossman booked them into The Bitter End , a coffee house , nightclub and popular folk music venue in New York City 's Greenwich Village .
They recorded their debut album , Peter , Paul and Mary , the following year .
It included " Lemon Tree " , " 500 Miles " , and the Pete Seeger hit tunes " If I Had a Hammer " ( subtitled " The Hammer Song " ) and " Where Have All the Flowers Gone ? " .
The album was listed in the Billboard Magazine Top Ten for 10 months , including seven weeks in the No . 1 position .
It remained a main catalog - seller for decades to come , eventually selling over two million copies , earning double platinum certification from the RIAA in the United States alone .
In 1963 the group released " Puff , the Magic Dragon " , with music by Yarrow and words based on a poem that had been written by a fellow student at Cornell , Leonard Lipton .
Despite rumors that the song refers to drugs , it is actually about the lost innocence of childhood .
That year the group performed " If I Had a Hammer " and " Blowin ' in the Wind " at the 1963 March on Washington , best remembered for the Reverend Martin Luther King , Jr. 's " I Have a Dream " speech .
The Bob Dylan song " Blowin ' in the Wind " was one of their biggest hit singles .
They also sang other Dylan songs , such as " The Times
They Are a - Changin ' " ; " Do n't Think Twice
, It 's All Right , " and " When the Ship Comes In . "
Their success with Dylan 's " Do n't Think Twice , It 's All
Right " helped Dylan 's The Freewheelin ' Bob Dylan album rise into the top 30 ; it had been released four months earlier .
In December 1969 " Leaving on a Jet Plane " , written by the group 's friend John Denver , became their only No . 1 single ( as well as their final top 40 pop hit ) and the group 's sixth million - selling gold single .
The track first appeared on their million - selling platinum certified Album 1700 in 1967 ( which also contained their No . 9
hit " I Dig Rock and Roll Music " ) .
Following Minnesota Sen. Eugene McCarthy 's strong showing in the 1968 New Hampshire Primary , the group recorded " Eugene McCarthy
For President ( If You Love Your Country ) " endorsing McCarthy , which was released without a record label . "
Day Is Done " , a No . 21 hit in June 1969 from the trio 's Grammy award - winning Peter , Paul and Mommy album
, was the last hot-100 hit that the trio recorded .
BREAKUP
( 1970–1978 ) Section::::Breakup ( 1970–1978 ) .
The trio broke up in 1970 to pursue solo careers .
Also during that year Peter Yarrow was convicted of making sexual advances toward a 14-year - old girl .
Years later , Yarrow received a presidential pardon from Jimmy Carter .
Travers recorded five solo LPs and did concerts and lectures across the United States .
She also produced , wrote , and starred in a BBC - TV series .
Stookey formed a Christian music group called the Body Works Band .
Yarrow co - wrote and produced Mary MacGregor 's Torn Between Two Lovers ( No . 1 , 1977 ) and earned an Emmy for three animated TV specials based on " Puff the Magic Dragon . "
Stookey wrote " The Wedding Song ( There is Love ) " for Yarrow 's marriage to Marybeth McCarthy , the niece of Eugene McCarthy , according to Stookey during an interview on the DVD Carry It On , released in 2004 by Rhino Records .
While the group was de - facto broken up and touring separately , the trio still managed to come together for a series of reunions before officially coming back together again .
In 1972 , the trio reunited for a concert at Madison Square Garden to support George McGovern 's presidential campaign , and again in 1978 , for a concert to protest against nuclear energy .
This concert was followed by a 1978 summer reunion tour .
Included was a September 3 evening performance at Red Rocks Amphitheatre outside of Denver , Colorado .
RECONCILIATION ( 1981–2009 )
Section::::Reconciliation ( 1981–2009 ) .
The summer tour in 1978 proved so popular that the group decided to reunite more or less permanently in 1981 .
They continued to record albums together and tour , playing around 45 shows a year , until the 2009 death of Mary Travers .
The trio would be accompanied in concert by double - bassist Dick Kniss ( who had been their bassist on their studio recordings and their 1960 's tours ) and , starting in 1990 , by multi - instrumentalist Paul Prestopino .
The trio were awarded the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience on September 1 , 1990 .
In 2004 , Travers was diagnosed with leukemia , leading to the cancellation of the remaining tour dates for that year .
She received a bone marrow transplant .
She and the rest of the trio resumed their concert tour on December 9 , 2005 with a holiday performance at Carnegie Hall .
The trio cancelled several dates of their summer 2007 tour , as Travers had to undergo a second surgery .
Travers was unable to perform on the trio 's tour in mid-2009 because of the effects of leukemia , but Peter and Paul performed the scheduled dates as a duo , calling the show " Peter & Paul Celebrate Mary and 5 Decades of Friendship . "
On September 16 , 2009 , Mary Travers died at the age of 72 , of complications from chemotherapy , following treatment for leukemia .
It was the same year Peter , Paul and Mary were inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame .
