On the outskirts of Washington , the group are recruited by a scout for the nearby Alexandria Safe - Zone , at Alexandria , Virginia named Aaron .
Andrea becomes the town 's look - out .
Although she is pessimistic as to how long their safety will last , she attempts to discourage Rick from challenging the safe zone 's hierarchy .
She rebuffs the romantic advances of the zone 's leader , Douglas Monroe .
While she later shares a series of flirtations with Douglas Monroe 's son , Spencer , that culminates in their almost kissing , she terminates their fledgling relationship when he suggests they abandon the zone while the other inhabitants are under attack by zombies , including his own father and her friends .
Andrea gradually begins to develop feelings for Rick .
They share a kiss , but he rebuffs her , with the explanation that everyone he cares about dies , and he does not want to lose her .
She attempts to convince him that their shared experiences make them uniquely compatible , and insists on joining him in his journey to a neighboring safe zone twenty two miles away known as the Hilltop Colony to demonstrate that he need not worry about her safety .
Andrea , along with Rick , Michonne , Carl , and Glenn , go to the Hilltop Colony by ambassador Paul Monroe , a community hoping to start a trading network with them .
There , they are shown around and introduced to Gregory .
Another resident of the colony , Ethan , returns from a failed mission where all of his companions were killed except for himself and a woman named Crystal .
Ethan then tells Gregory he has a message for him and stabs him .
Rick tackles Ethan to the ground and in the struggle cuts his throat , while the rest of the residents stare at him , shocked .
The survivors learn of the Hilltop 's trading with the dangerous Saviors and Andrea believes it to be " messed up " that they had taken advantage of it and taken most of their supplies .
On the way back to Alexandria , they are stopped by a band of Saviors demanding all the supplies that Gregory gave them .
The group kills all but one of the Saviors , issuing a warning to send back to their leader Negan and they make it back to the community .

WAR AGAINST NEGAN ( 2012–14 ) Section::::War against Negan
( 2012–14 ) .
Andrea is taken aback by Rick 's news of Glenn 's death and feels they should retaliate by killing Dwight .
He refuses , but she angrily protests saying he stop blaming himself every time someone they care about dies .
During a meeting the next day , Andrea interrupts Rick and tries to rally the others to support her in fighting the Saviors .
Rick says that he knows what he 's doing and releases Dwight to go back to Negan .
Furious at Rick , Andrea decides to move out , but , when Rick tells her that he 's planning to take on The Saviors in the future , she forgives him .
Rick tells Andrea about the alliance formed between the Safe - Zone , Dwight , and the leader of the Kingdom ( another networking community )
Ezekiel .
He also gives more details about his plan , which she is happy to hear .
She is then taken by Rick , along with Heath , Aaron , Michonne , and Carl , to visit the Kingdom .
During their stay , Andrea observes several of the residents and is impressed with their accuracy with firearms .
Rick tells her that there are over thirty residents in the Kingdom who are ready for combat , plus the twenty or so men that Paul is bringing from the Hilltop .
She is a little hesitant and worried that they might not have enough manpower , but , Rick assures her that Eugene 's ammunition production will help even the score .
During a conference between Rick , Ezekiel , and Paul , Andrea agrees with Ezekiel 's plan to focus on hitting the Savior outposts and whittle away their numbers .
When they arrive back to the Safe - Zone , they are greeted with troubling news that Negan has arrived ahead of schedule and that he gutted Spencer , killing him .
After Rick has an argument with Negan , he tells Andrea that this may be their best chance of killing Negan and to grab her rifle and get to the bell tower .
He also tells her to rally the Alexandria defenders and have them assemble at the wall .
She is able to kill the Savior who was driving the truck , however she is unable to get a clear shot of Negan .
After the shot , Connor finds her , beats her , and almost kills her in the bell tower .
While strangling her , Connor expresses his regret on killing her , since he sees that she 's been through so much .
Andrea reaches for his knife and slashes his arm .
She gets up and tries to kill him , until he pushes her against the ledge of the tower , with the knife against his throat .
Connor challenges her to kill him before he pushes off .
Right before she is about to be pushed over the ledge to her death , she flips Connor out of the tower and kills him .
She then states that she and Rick are survivors .
After this scuffle , Andrea passes out in the tower until Rick and Michonne help her back to the safe - zone .
Back at the safe - zone , beaten and bruised , Andrea is patched up by Dr. Denise Cloyd .
Andrea spends her time in recovery and bonds with Carl until Negan bombs the safe zone and they are forced to leave to the Hilltop , which Maggie Greene now rules over .
Andrea assures Rick that everything he has done to unite the communities against Negan is justified .
She shares a hug with her new family before Rick makes the decision to confront the attacking Saviors who are outside the Hilltop 's walls .
She is shocked to hear that Rick is keeping him alive to rot in a cell , as she believes he should be publicly executed .
POST - WAR ( 2014–2017 ) Section::::Post - war ( 2014–2017 ) .

Knowing Andrea may be in trouble at Woodbury , Rick and others head there , but arrive too late : Milton had turned , and while Andrea did free herself enough to subdue Milton 's reanimated body , she has also been bitten .

She asks Rick for his gun to end her own life , and the others leave as Michonne stays behind with Andrea before she commits suicide .
Andrea 's body is brought back to the prison to be buried .
DEVELOPMENT CASTING Section::::Development .
Section::::Casting .
Andrea is portrayed by Laurie Holden ( The X - Files , The Shield , Silent Hill ) , who was cast as part of the series in 2010 .
Prior to the show , Holden had been in two of Frank Darabont 's films , The Majestic ( 2001 ) and The Mist ( 2007 ) ; in the latter she starred with three other Walking Dead cast members ( Melissa McBride , Juan Pareja and Jeffrey DeMunn ) .
Soon after being cast , she read through the comics to analyze and get a definite understanding of Andrea 's character .
She acknowledged her enjoyment of having a much more physical role than on some of her other past projects , as well as her excitement towards having her character gradually become a warrior like in the comics .
CHARACTERIZATION Section::::Characterization .
Andrea , as she appears in the comic series , is described by The Hollywood Reporter James Hibberd as " a key member of the survivor group who has a proficiency with a sniper rifle and falls for a man twice her age . "
Showrunner Scott M. Gimple ( season 4–present ) describes Andrea in the comic as having an " interesting evolution " .
He said : " There was a certain brashness and cockiness that she had .
We 've seen her mature .
" In the television series , she attempts suicide at the end of the first season , but Dale talks her out of this .
Comic creator Robert Kirkman explained that her ensuing desire to protect herself would begin her evolution into her comic counterpart , " the fearless sharpshooter " .
On television , Andrea 's motivation shifts following Dale 's death .
Holden allowed the event to color her portrayal , and for the remainder of season two , before each scene she filmed , she thought " Andrea , you must honor Dale . "
She explained that " every move that Andrea makes from that point forward is about honoring Dale , and that means being a leader , having a stronger moral compass , being compassionate and really lending her hand more so than she would have before . "
Former showrunner Glen Mazzara deemed Andrea the only character who could " hold [ her ] head up " after Dale 's death , as she alone supported him against killing Randall and is " the one person who feels that she stood by him at the end . "
RELATIONSHIPS Section::::Relationships .
In the comic series , Andrea has a physical relationship with Dale .
Holden was surprised to discover this while researching her role , but in March 2011 , stated her intention to " honor the relationship well " .
However , Mazzara and Kirkman decided not to incorporate the relationship into the television series , and Dale was killed much sooner in the television series than he was in the comics .
Holden was dismayed by his departure ; she commented that she " love[d ] the Dale - Andrea dynamic and ...
felt like [ they ] had so much more story to explore together " .
For Kirkman , the effect of Dale 's death on the continuing plot was worth sacrificing their relationship .
He expressed his approval of the differences between the series and its source material , and advised viewers interested in the relationship storyline to read the comics .
Also in the comics , Andrea and Rick eventually become romantically involved within their time at the Alexandria Safe - Zone community .
Their relationship , while genuine and affectionate , was initially shown to be strained , as Rick struggled to get over the deaths of his past lovers and Andrea found herself constantly at odds with some of Rick 's decisions in life - threatening matters .
Later , especially near the end of the war and two years later , Andrea and Rick 's relationship is very intimate and close , as Carl looks to Andrea as a maternal figure , referring to her " mom " .
Though Shane dies in the comics before the group reaches the farm , he remains alive longer in the television series .
This resulted in alterations to the ensuing plot , including the creation of a relationship between Andrea and Shane .
In season three , Andrea begins flirting with the Governor , the leader of a town
she and Michonne are staying at , before she enters into a full - fledged romantic / sexual relationship with him .
DEPARTURE FROM SHOW Section::::Departure from show .
The death of Andrea ( Laurie Holden ) in the television series marks one of the biggest departures from Robert Kirkman 's source material in which Andrea played an active role within the series beyond this for a total of 13 years .
In an interview published March 31 , 2013 , TVLine asked Holden how long in advance she knew about her character Andrea 's death .
Holden replied , " I did n't get the official word until a few days before we began [ shooting ] the finale .
It was a shock to everyone .
It was never part of the original story docs for Season 3 .
And it was rather unexpected . "
Robert Kirkman said : " The comics still exist and I 'd urge those people to continue reading the comics where Andrea is still alive .
Just know the show is something different and we are telling different stories .
It does n't mean we 're not going to see a lot of the big stories and big events from the comic book in the TV show eventually ; it just means those things will be a little bit altered from time to time .
Hopefully it will be exciting , new and fresh just like it was the first time you read the comic , which is really the goal . "
Kirkman also said : " It 's something that was debated quite a bit .
There was a lot of opposition in the writers ' room .
I bounced back and forth between ' We really should n't kill her ' and ' this is a good idea . '
In the end it all came together and we decided to go for it .
It was definitely something that divided the room to a certain extent . "
Holden expressed desires of wanting to continue Andrea 's story
but she was grateful for the end result : " Do I wish we could 've seen and explored more of the comic - book - Robert - Kirkman Andrea ?
Yes .
Absolutely .
Do I wish that I had more scenes with Michonne showing that friendship ?
Yes .
Absolutely .
But at the end of the day , I do n't think I could ask for a better death .
I feel like her life mattered , and she died trying , and her heart was in the right place .
I feel grateful for that .
You ca n't have it all . "
Glen Mazzara said the decision to kill off Andrea occurred organically throughout the season , and talks of it emerged half - way through .
He also addressed that he never planned to faithfully follow the comic book source material anyway , regarding the negative feedback from comic book readers .
On the significance of Andrea 's death , he said : I thought it was important that we always show that no one is safe .
It 's also important to show the effect that these deaths have on our other characters .
Andrea 's death , for example , I knew Rick was going to finally open up the gates of the prison after a season in which he 's trying to hide away from the world and lock everybody away and keep them safe .
He realizes what that means -- that our group is now becoming isolated and will be picked off , that his own son is on the road to becoming the Governor ( David Morrissey ) , so he has to open up the gates and let other people in and be compassionate .
At the end of the finale , he brings in these women , children and elderly people and the group is going to transform .
There needed to be a blood sacrifice for that , and there had to be a price that was paid .
Andrea paying that price was important .
She is unable to re - enter the group .
In a way , a lot of what she did was bring the two groups together .
But she 's never able to enter the prison and be reunited in a full way with Rick 's group .
That was an ultimate sacrifice that was worthy of the season finale .
At Walker Stalker Con Chicago in 2014 , Greg Nicotero and Laurie Holden discussed in depth the death of Andrea .
They revealed there were three different versions of the script .
One version included Andrea surviving the season finale and saving the people of Woodbury , leading them back to the prison .
The other was the one that was written by Glen Mazzara and the aired one re - written partially by Scott Gimple .
Holden felt that re - shooting her original death scene two months later was satisfying , because " she needed to be with her friends " and felt that she died with " grace " in the re - shoot as opposed to a " D - movie horror death " in the original run .
Holden also revealed that the decision caused Glen Mazzara to lose his job as showrunner , as many of the writers were against the concept .
Nicotero felt that Andrea 's character got " lost in the writing " for the third season .
DEPARTURE FROM COMIC BOOK SERIES Section::::Departure from comic book series .
The death of Andrea in the comic book series came 4 years later in " Issue # 167 " after the war with Negan and the Whisperers .
Robert Kirkman issued an apology for killing Andrea and said , " " I 'm sorry .
I 'm sorry to my fans and to myself and to Andrea .
I feel like I killed a close friend .
The deaths in this series are never taken lightly , they 're never done with a sense of glee .
They weigh on me the same way they weigh on you .
These characters are very real to me , and their deaths are upsetting even to me .
I plotted this issue out during a plane ride a few months ago .
I plot my stories down with a pencil and paper , and there I was in my seat , blocking out scenes and writing dialog notes , surrounded by strangers who probably thought I was jotting down a shopping list .
As I was writing some of the moments from this issue , I started crying .
I found myself glancing around , wiping my eyes , hoping no one would notice .
I 've been living with this death for months now … and I do n't like it .
I had plenty of time to change my mind .
I had plenty of time to just not do it .
I am in control of this story after all .
But honestly , sometimes it feels like I 'm not .
This was one of those times .
I do n't like this .
I do n't want this .
I want Andrea to live .
I want to write more stories with her .
I want to see her and Rick grow old together , watching Carl grow up and have kids of his own .
I want that kind of happiness for these characters .
And yet , here we are .
Andrea is dead and the story moves on .
I do n't know why this had to happen …
but I know it did .
I know this is another important turning point in the life of this series .
I know Andrea 's death will mean something , that will resonate in the stories moving forward for years to come .
But I still do n't like it .
It still upsets me .
I loved Andrea and I will truly miss her . "

Her portrayal as Andrea in " TS-19 " was particularly well received by MTV 's Josh Wigler , who said she " delivered great character work . "
Similarly , Alan Sepinwall of HitFix ultimately cited the performance of Laurie Holden as an episode highlight .
For her performance in the second season , she was also nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Scream Award .
For the season 2 premiere " What Lies Ahead " , Derek Boeckelmann of the Daily Nexus praised the performance of Holden , saying that she " continues to be the strongest of the show 's players , consistently putting forth exceptional performances as the grieving Andrea . "
Critics applauded the growing relationship between Andrea and Shane in the episode " Secrets " .
Despite describing them as an " unlikely pairing " , Scott Meslow of The Atlantic asserted that it was superior to the storyline between Andrea and Dale .
" There 's something to be said for the occasional post - apocalyptic tryst , which allows two characters who 've experienced almost nothing but misery to have , even for a moment , something that resembles joy , " he articulated .
Meslow retorted that it was wise to underplay the tryst between Shane and Andrea , which he predicted would not lead to anything serious .
The character development of Andrea produced uniform praise among critics in the season 2 finale , " Beside the Dying Fire " .
Writing for Paste , Josh Jackson felt that it served as the episode 's highlight , and further assessed that she emulated actress Linda Hamilton . "
After a season of whining , there had to have been at least a few fans pulling for the walkers in her early scenes , but she quickly became Linda Hamilton - badass , braining zombies with her foot , " he said .
Likewise , Kine asserted that " the badass she has tried so hard to convince us all she is finally came across . "
Ryan thought that Andrea 's struggle to survive was a strong way to build up the exodus of the group .
She spoke of her scene with Michonne : " She 'd fought so hard to live that I wanted Andrea to fend off that final batch of walkers successfully .
When it appeared she might not live , I was , quite rightly , on the edge of my seat .
And the appearance of the caped figure — towing two armless walkers , no less — was as dramatic as could be . " .
Andrea 's role in the third season is a significant departure from the comic book series .
In comparison to previous seasons , her role was criticized and garnered generally negative critiques .
Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly commented negatively on Andrea 's actions and her relationship with The Governor , invented for the show , saying : " The characters on Walking Dead appear stuck in their tracks , reliving the same traumas over and over .
Will Andrea fall for next season 's villain , too ? "
Entertainment Weekly later included Andrea in their list of " 21 Most Annoying TV Characters Ever " .
Zack Handlen , writing for The A.V. Club felt that the climax of " I Ai n't a Judas " did n't strengthen the sense of who Andrea is , and called the character " problematic " and " a mess " , which " only becomes more obvious when she 's asked to serve as the center of some kind of ongoing moral crisis . "
He then speculated whether " the horrible scripting " was responsible .
Eric Goldman for IGN disliked the episode because it was Andrea - centric , a character he disliked particularly in the third season .
Andrea 's death received a polarized reaction .
For " Welcome to the Tombs " , IGN writer Eric Goldman disliked that the finale rested its dramatic conclusion on Andrea 's death .
AV Club writer Zack Handlen said that Andrea would be " missed less " than Milton .
Erik Kain of Forbes.com said that " Finally , Andrea is dead .
I know this is something I 've wished for all season , but it almost felt cheap at the end . "
Conversely , Josh Jackson , writing for Paste called the death " a heartbreaking end for the woman who tried to make between the two gangs of survivors .
" Despite the negative reception Andrea received for the third season , Holden was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her work on The Walking Dead in 2013 , and won .
