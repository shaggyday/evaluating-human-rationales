AMERICAN BULLY
The American Bully is a recently formed companion dog breed , originally recognized by the American Bully Kennel Club ( ABKC ) .
It has been recognized by the United Kennel Club ( UKC ) since July 15 , 2013 .
It is a small to large breed which has been divided into four categories ; Pocket , Standard , Classic and XL .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Founded in the United States between 1980 and 1990 , the American Bully was produced using a foundation of American Staffordshire Terriers and American Pit Bull Terriers bred to several bulldog - type breeds .
It was created with the purpose of being a family companion dog .
While some of the founding kennels , namely Razor 's Edge owner Dave Wilson , affirmed that they used only the two first aforementioned breeds to produce the desired dogs , it is consensus that at least five other breeds were used to attain the more " bully " physical traits desired .
These are assumed to be the American Bulldog , English Bulldog , Olde English Bulldogge , Staffordshire Bull Terrier and French Bulldog .
According to ABKC the initial desire for this breed was to produce a dog with a lower drive and more of the " bully " traits than the American Staffordshire Terrier .
Mass and heavy bone was prioritized to ensure such a look , and due to this many of the dogs shown today display the wide front for which they were originally bred .
The breed was first recognized by its breed club , the American Bully Kennel Club , in 2004 .
This registry first acted as a means to document pedigrees and show the breed against its written standard .
During the early years of the breed , a wide spectrum of dogs were shown , many displaying physical traits of the other introduced breeds ; these were penalized heavily by the registry , forcing owners and breeders of such dogs to create new means to show their style of dog without being rejected .
VARIETIES Section::::Varieties .
Within the ABKC , the four varieties are separated by height without specification of weight .
All these varieties are expected to follow the same standard with minor alterations .
All dogs are classified and shown as Standard until they reach a year of age , at which point they are separated into the varieties and shown against their own type .
CLASSIC Section::::Classic .
The original American Bully style is the Classic ; these dogs do not display the exaggerated features often found in the other varieties , and arguably display clearer ABKC American Pit Bull Terrier / American Staffordshire Terrier lineage .
The Classic is a lighter frame dog than the Standard but falls within the same height range ; male dogs must be while females must be .
Although lighter framed , classic dogs should not be confused with dogs that lack breed .

Smaller dogs are sometimes called " Micro " and larger ones are called " XXL " , but neither are recognized by the kennel clubs as legitimate varieties .
Previously a fifth category was accepted , Extreme , however as the breed is intended to be an exaggerated breed the ABKC removed the category for show purposes .
TEMPERAMENT Section::::Temperament .
The American Bully is a highly adaptable breed , often acting as a laid back companion dog in the home while showing a zest for life and energy while outside .
Many dogs , despite acting as lap dogs in the home , do well in sports such as weight pull and flirt pole .
Despite excelling in such sports and public misconception , dog and human aggression is discouraged in the breed .
HEALTH
Section::::Health .
