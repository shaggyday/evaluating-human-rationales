EUSTACHIAN TUBE
The Eustachian tube , also known as the auditory tube or pharyngotympanic tube , is a tube that links the nasopharynx to the middle ear .
It is a part of the middle ear .
In adult humans the Eustachian tube is approximately long and in diameter .
It is named after the sixteenth - century Italian anatomist Bartolomeo Eustachi .
In humans and other land animals the middle ear ( like the ear canal ) is normally filled with air .
Unlike the open ear canal , however , the air of the middle ear is not in direct contact with the atmosphere outside the body .
The Eustachian tube connects from the chamber of the middle ear to the back of the nasopharynx .
Normally , the Eustachian tube is collapsed , but it gapes open both with swallowing and with positive pressure .
When taking off in an airplane , the surrounding air pressure goes from higher ( on the ground ) to lower ( in the sky ) .
The air in the middle ear expands as the plane gains altitude , and pushes its way into the back of the nose and mouth .
On the way down , the volume of air in the middle ear shrinks , and a slight vacuum is produced .
Active opening of the Eustachian tube is required to equalize the pressure between the middle ear and the surrounding atmosphere as the plane descends .
A diver also experiences this change in pressure , but with greater rates of pressure change ; active opening of the Eustachian tube is required more frequently as the diver goes deeper into higher pressure .
STRUCTURE
Section::::Structure .
The Eustachian tube extends from the anterior wall of the middle ear to the lateral wall of the nasopharynx , approximately at the level of the inferior nasal concha .
It consists of a bony part and a cartilaginous part .
BONY PART Section::::Bony part .
The bony part ( 1/3 ) nearest to the middle ear is made of bone and is about 12 mm in length .
It begins in the anterior wall of the tympanic cavity , below the septum canalis musculotubarii , and , gradually narrowing , ends at the angle of junction of the squamous and the petrous parts of the temporal bone , its extremity presenting a jagged margin which serves for the attachment of the cartilaginous part .
CARTILAGINOUS
PART
Section::::Cartilaginous part .
The cartilaginous part of the Eustachian tube is about 24 mm in length and is formed of a triangular plate of elastic fibrocartilage , the apex of which is attached to the margin of the medial end of the bony part of the tube , while its base lies directly under the mucous membrane of the nasal part of the pharynx , where it forms an elevation , the torus tubarius or cushion , behind the pharyngeal opening of the auditory tube .
The upper edge of the cartilage is curled upon itself , being bent laterally so as to present on transverse section the appearance of a hook ; a groove or furrow is thus produced , which is open below and laterally , and this part of the canal is completed by fibrous membrane .
The cartilage lies in a groove between the petrous part of the temporal bone and the great wing of the sphenoid ; this groove ends opposite the middle of the medial pterygoid plate .
The cartilaginous and bony portions of the tube are not in the same plane , the former inclining downward a little more than the latter .
The diameter of the tube is not uniform throughout , being greatest at the pharyngeal opening , least at the junction of the bony and cartilaginous portions , and again increased toward the tympanic cavity ; the narrowest part of the tube is termed the isthmus .
The position and relations of the pharyngeal opening are described with the nasal part of the pharynx .
The mucous membrane of the tube is continuous in front with that of the nasal part of the pharynx , and behind with that of the tympanic cavity ; it is covered with ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelia and is thin in the osseous portion , while in the cartilaginous portion it contains many mucous glands and near the pharyngeal orifice a considerable amount of adenoid tissue , which has been named by Gerlach the tube tonsil .
MUSCLES Section::::Muscles .
There are four muscles associated with the function of the Eustachian tube :
* Levator veli palatini ( innervated by the vagus nerve )
* Salpingopharyngeus ( innervated by the vagus nerve )
*
Tensor tympani ( innervated by the mandibular nerve of CN V )
*
Tensor veli palatini ( innervated by the mandibular nerve of CN V )
The tube is opened during swallowing by contraction of the tensor veli palatini and levator veli palatini , muscles of the soft palate .
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Development .
The Eustachian tube is derived from the ventral part of the first pharyngeal pouch and second endodermal pouch , which during embryogenesis forms the tubotympanic recess .
The distal part of the tubotympanic sulcus gives rise to the tympanic cavity , while the proximal tubular structure becomes the Eustachian tube .
It helps transformation of sound waves .
FUNCTION PRESSURE EQUALIZATION
Section::::Function .
Section::::Pressure equalization .
Under normal circumstances , the human Eustachian tube is closed , but it can open to let a small amount of air through to prevent damage by equalizing pressure between the middle ear and the atmosphere .
Pressure differences cause temporary conductive hearing loss by decreased motion of the tympanic membrane and ossicles of the ear .
Various methods of ear clearing such as yawning , swallowing , or chewing gum may be used to intentionally open the tube and equalize pressures .
When this happens , humans hear a small popping sound , an event familiar to aircraft passengers , scuba divers , or drivers in mountainous regions .
Devices assisting in pressure equalization include an ad hoc balloon applied to the nose , creating inflation by positive air pressure .
Some people learn to voluntarily ' click ' their ears , together or separately , performing a pressure equalizing routine by opening their Eustachian tubes when pressure changes are experienced , as in ascending / descending in aircraft , mountain driving , elevator lift / drops , etc .
Some are even able to deliberately keep their Eustachian tubes open for a brief period , and even increase or decrease air pressure in the middle ear .
The ' clicking ' can actually be heard by putting one 's ear to another 's while performing the clicking sound .
This voluntary control may be first discovered when yawning or swallowing , or by other means ( above ) .
Those who develop this ability may discover that it can be done deliberately without force even when there are no pressure issues involved .
MUCUS DRAINAGE Section::::Mucus drainage .
The Eustachian tube also drains mucus from the middle ear .
Upper respiratory tract infections or allergies can cause the Eustachian tube , or the membranes surrounding its opening to become swollen , trapping fluid , which serves as a growth medium for bacteria , causing ear infections .
This swelling can be reduced through the use of decongestants such as pseudoephedrine , oxymetazoline , and phenylephrine .
Ear infections are more common in children because the tube is horizontal and shorter , making bacterial entry easier , and it also has a smaller diameter , making the movement of fluid more difficult .
In addition , children 's developing immune systems and poor hygiene habits make them more prone to upper respiratory infections .
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Section::::Clinical significance .
Otitis media , or inflammation of the middle ear , commonly affects the Eustachian tube .
Children under 7 are more susceptible to this condition , one theory being that this is because the Eustachian tube is shorter and at more of a horizontal angle than in the adult ear .
Others argue that susceptibility in this age group is related to immunological factors and not Eustachian tube anatomy .
Barotitis , a form of barotrauma , may occur when there is a substantial difference in air or water pressure between the outer and the inner ear â€” for example , during a rapid ascent while scuba diving , or during sudden decompression of an aircraft at high altitude .
Some people are born with a dysfunctional Eustachian tube that is much slimmer than usual .
The cause may be genetic , but it has also been posited as a condition in which the patient did not fully recover from the effects of pressure on the middle ear during birth ( retained birth compression ) .
It is suggested that Eustachian tube dysfunction can result in a large amount of mucus accumulating in the middle ear , often impairing hearing to a degree .
This condition is known as otitis media with effusion , and may result in the mucus becoming very thick and glue - like , a condition known as glue ear .
A patulous Eustachian tube is a rare condition in which the Eustachian tube remains intermittently open , causing an echoing sound of the person 's own heartbeat , breathing , and speech .
This may be temporarily relieved by holding the head upside down .
Smoking can also cause damage to the cilia that protect the Eustachian tube from mucus , which can result in the clogging of the tube and a buildup of bacteria in the ear , leading to a middle ear infection .
Recurring and chronic cases of sinus infection can result in Eustachian tube dysfunction caused by excessive mucus production which , in turn , causes obstruction to the openings of the Eustachian tubes .
SURGICAL EARDRUM
PIERCING
Section::::Surgical eardrum piercing .
In severe cases of childhood inner ear infections and Eustachian tube blockage , ventilation can be provided by a surgical puncturing of the eardrum to permit air equalization , known as myringotomy .
The eardrum would normally naturally heal and close the hole , so a tiny plastic rimmed grommet is inserted into the hole to hold it open .
This is known as a tympanostomy tube .
As a child grows , the tube is eventually naturally expelled by the body .
Longer - lasting vent grommets with larger flanges have been researched , but these can lead to permanent perforation of the eardrum .
PERMANENT VENTING TO EXTERNAL EAR CANAL Section::::Permanent venting to external ear canal .
Surgical implantation of permanent bypasses around the eardrum have also been studied , though these suffer from blockage issues , requiring frequent manual cleaning .
These also can lead to inner ear infection due to the direct path from the external to the internal ear .
EUSTACHIAN TUBE PROSTHESIS Section::::Eustachian tube prosthesis .
Another approach to permitting middle ear drainage is the use of a prosthesis inserted into the Eustachian tube , to assist in holding the tube open .
The prosthesis does not necessarily hold the tube completely open all the time , but may instead lightly brace the tissue walls of a narrow tube to assist in venting .
One such example invented in 1978 is a silicone tube with a flange at the top , which keeps it from dislodging and sliding out into the throat .
However , in a study in 1978 it was not found to be effective for long - term use , and would eventually become internally blocked with mucus or otitis media , or dislodged from its position .
REMOVAL OF EXCESSIVE TUBE TISSUE Section::::Removal of excessive tube tissue .
Debridement has also been studied as a solution to inability to open the Eustachian tube .
Hypertrophy ( excessive growth ) of the cells that produce mucus can make the tube hard to open , and the procedure to reduce the growth is known as " microdebrider Eustachian tuboplasty " .
OTHER ANIMALS
Section::::Other animals .
In the equids ( horses ) and some rodent - like species such as the desert hyrax , an evagination of the Eustachian tube is known as the guttural pouch and is divided into medial and lateral compartments by the stylohyoid bone of the hyoid apparatus .
This is of great importance in equine medicine as the pouches are prone to infections , and , due to their intimate relationship to the cranial nerves ( VII , IX , X , XI ) and the internal and external carotid artery , various syndromes may arise relating to which is damaged .
Epistaxis ( nosebleed ) is a very common presentation to veterinary surgeons and this may often be fatal unless a balloon catheter can be placed in time to suppress bleeding .
