PROTECTED HEALTH
INFORMATION
Protected health information ( PHI ) under the US law is any information about health status , provision of health care , or payment for health care that is created or collected by a Covered Entity ( or a Business Associate of a Covered Entity ) , and can be linked to a specific individual .
This is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient 's medical record or payment history .
PHI is often sought out in datasets for de - identification before researchers share the dataset publicly .
Researchers remove individually identifiable PHI from a dataset to preserve privacy for research participants .
UNITED STATES Section::::United States .
Under the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) , PHI that is linked based on the following list of 18 identifiers must be treated with special care :
* Names * * All geographical identifiers smaller than a state , except for the initial three digits of a zip code if , according to the current publicly available data from the U.S. Bureau of the Census : the geographic unit formed by combining all zip codes with the same three initial digits contains more than 20,000 people ; and the initial three digits of a zip code for all such geographic units containing 20,000 or fewer people is changed to 000
*
* Dates ( other than year ) directly related to an individual * * Phone Numbers * * Fax numbers
*
* Email addresses * * Social Security numbers
* * Medical record numbers * * Health insurance beneficiary numbers * * Account numbers * * Certificate / license numbers *
* Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers , including license plate numbers ;
*
* Device identifiers and serial numbers ; * * Web Uniform Resource Locators ( URLs ) * * Internet Protocol ( IP ) address numbers *
* Biometric identifiers , including finger , retinal and voice prints *
* Full face photographic images and any comparable images *
* Any other unique identifying number , characteristic , or code except the unique code assigned by the investigator to code the data * DE - IDENTIFICATION
VERSUS ANONYMIZATION Section::::De - identification versus anonymization .
Anonymization is a process in which PHI elements are eliminated or manipulated with the purpose of hindering the possibility of going back to the original data set .
This involves removing all identifying data to create unlinkable data .
De - identification under the HIPAA Privacy Rule occurs when data has been stripped of common identifiers by two methods : De - identified data is coded , with a link to the original , fully identified data set kept by an honest broker .
Links exist in coded de - identified data making the data considered indirectly identifiable and not anonymized .
Coded de - identified data is not protected by the HIPAA Privacy Rule , but is protected under the Common Rule .
The purpose of de - identification and anonymization is to use health care data in larger increments , for research purposes .
Universities , government agencies , and private health care entities use such data for research , development and marketing purposes .
Covered Entities
In general , US law governing PHI applies to data collected in the course of providing and paying for health care .
Privacy and security regulations govern how healthcare professionals , hospitals , health insurers , and other Covered Entities use and protect the data they collect .
It is important to understand that the source of the data is as relevant as the data itself when determining if information is PHI under U.S. law .
For example , sharing information about someone on the street with an obvious medical condition such as an amputation is not restricted by US law .
However , obtaining information about the amputation exclusively from a protected source , such as from an electronic medical record , would breach HIPAA regulations .
Business Associates Covered Entities often use third parties to provide certain health and business services .
If they need to share PHI with those third parties , it is the responsibility of the Covered Entity to put in place a Business Associate Agreement that holds the third party to the same standards of privacy and confidentiality as the Covered Entity .
