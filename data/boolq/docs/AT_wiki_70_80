KUWAITI DINAR
The Kuwaiti dinar ( , code : KWD ) is the currency of Kuwait .
It is sub - divided into 1,000 fils .
The Kuwaiti dinar is currently the world 's highest - valued currency unit per face value .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The dinar was introduced in 1960 to replace the Gulf rupee , equal to the Indian rupee .
It was initially equivalent to one pound sterling .
As the rupee was fixed at 1 shilling 6 pence , that resulted in a conversion rate of rupees to the dinar .
When Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 , the Iraqi dinar replaced the Kuwaiti dinar as the currency and large quantities of banknotes were stolen by the invading forces .
After liberation , the Kuwaiti dinar was restored as the country 's currency and a new banknote series was introduced , allowing the previous notes , including those stolen , to be demonetized .
COINS Section::::Coins .
The coins in the following table were introduced in 1961 .
The design of all coins is similar and has not changed since they were first minted .
On the obverse is a boom ship , with year of minting in both Islamic and Common Era in Arabic .
The reverse contains the value in Arabic within a central circle with إمَارَة الكُوَيت ( The State of Kuwait in Arabic ) above and KUWAIT in English below .
Unlike many other Middle Eastern currencies , Kuwait has a coin worth 0.2 of its main currency unit rather than 0.25 .
The 1 fils coin was last minted in 1988 . !
