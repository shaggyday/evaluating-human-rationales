PICKLING SALT Pickling salt is a salt that is used mainly for canning and manufacturing pickles .
It is sodium chloride , as is table salt , but unlike most brands of table salt , it does not contain iodine or any anti caking products added .
A widely circulated legend suggested that iodisation caused the brine of pickles to change color .
This is false ; however , some anti - caking agents are known to collect at the bottom of the jars , a minor aesthetic issue .
Pickling salt is very fine - grained , to speed up dissolving in water to create a brine , so it is useful for solutions needing salt .
OTHER USES
Section::::Other uses .
Pickling salt can be used for things other than pickling .
It can be used in place of table salt , although it can cake .
A solution to this would be to add a few grains of rice to the salt , or to bake it ( draws the moisture out ) , and then break it apart .
Pickling salt sticks well to food , so it can be used in place of popcorn salt , which also has fine grains .
