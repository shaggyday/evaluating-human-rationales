LIST OF SIGN LANGUAGES
There are perhaps three hundred sign languages in use around the world today .
The number is not known with any confidence ; new sign languages emerge frequently through creolization and de novo ( and occasionally through language planning ) .
In some countries , such as Sri Lanka and Tanzania , each school for the deaf may have a separate language , known only to its students and sometimes denied by the school ; on the other hand , countries may share sign languages , although sometimes under different names ( Croatian and Serbian , Indian and Pakistani ) .
Deaf sign languages also arise outside educational institutions , especially in village communities with high levels of congenital deafness , but there are significant sign languages developed for the hearing as well , such as the speech - taboo languages used in aboriginal Australia .
Scholars are doing field surveys to identify the world 's sign languages .
The following list is grouped into three sections : * Deaf sign languages , which are the preferred languages of Deaf communities around the world ; these include village sign languages , shared with the hearing community , and Deaf - community sign languages *
Auxiliary sign languages , which are not native languages but sign systems of varying complexity , used alongside spoken languages .
Simple gestures are not included , as they do not constitute language .
* Signed modes of spoken languages , also known as manually coded languages , which are bridges between signed and spoken languages
The list of deaf sign languages is sorted regionally and alphabetically , and such groupings should not be taken to imply any genetic relationships between these languages ( see List of language families ) .

Section::::Africa .
There are at least 25 sign languages in Africa , according to researcher Nobutaka Kamei .
Some have distributions that are completely independent of those of African spoken languages .
At least 13 foreign sign languages , mainly from Europe and America , have been introduced to at least 27 African nations ; some of the 23 sign languages documented by Kamei have originated with or been influenced by them . !
