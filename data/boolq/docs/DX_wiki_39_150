MEZCAL WORM
A mezcal worm is an insect larva found in some types of mezcal produced in Oaxaca , Mexico .
The larva is usually either a gusano rojo ( " red worm " ) or a chinicuil ( " maguey worm " ) , the caterpillar of the Comadia redtenbacheri moth .
The red worm is typically considered tastier .
Contrary to popular belief , a true Tequila does not contain a worm .
It is only in Tequila 's brother Mezcal .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Although the custom is relatively recent , larvae are used frequently by several brands of mezcal to give flavor to the drink .
A whole larva is deposited in the bottle , normally after having previously been cured in pure alcohol .
Nacional Vinicola ( NAVISA ) was the first company to add a worm to its Gusano Rojo mezcal .
Andres Paniagua and Jacobo Lozano , creators of Gusano Rojo and Dos Gusanos , first introduced the practice of adding larva to mezcal .
Today , several brands are doing this including Patron .
OTHER KINDS OF WORMS
Section::::Other kinds of worms .
The other variety of " worm " in mezcal is the larva of a weevil known as picudo del agave , Scyphophorus acupunctatus , the agave snout weevil , that infests certain species of yucca and maguey .
They are not related to edible maguey worms ( which are , in reality , a species each of moth or butterfly larvae ) of central Mexico .
The weevil is a pest that can severely damage agave plants , by eating the plant to death from the inside .
If only a few infest the plant , they can still carry and infect the plant with harmful bacteria leading to plant death .
In some cases , up to 40 % of a maguey harvest has been lost to weevil infestations .
Infection - resistant varieties of the plant are being developed .
Picudo larvae may be roasted and eaten ; they are a seasonal specialty of markets in southeastern Mexico .
