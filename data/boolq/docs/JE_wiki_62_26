PROJECT RUNWAY :
JUNIOR Project Runway :
Junior is an American reality television series that premiered on November 12 , 2015 on Lifetime .
It is the eighth direct spin - off series of another series , Project Runway , which airs on the same network .
It featured twelve teen designers aged between 13 and 17 .
The designers were described by Tim Gunn as " kids [ who ] have grown up watching this show " ( Project Runway ) .
The show was co - hosted by Tim Gunn and Hannah Jeter , with Gunn also serving as the designers ' workroom mentor .
In his role as mentor , Tim Gunn had a " Tim Gunn Save " with which he could bring back an eliminated designer once during the season at his discretion .
The three judges were fashion designer Christian Siriano
( Project Runway Season 4 's winner ) , fashion critic and designer Kelly Osbourne and Aya Kanai , Executive Fashion Director at Cosmopolitan and Seventeen magazines .
Of note , unlike other versions of Project Runway , the only episode with a guest judge was the finale .
According to Executive Producer Sara Rea , Project Runway : Junior is a re - creation of the original adult series with no concessions in the difficulty of challenges or critiques being made for the contestants ' ages .
The unconventional challenge featured items from a car wash and one challenge was introduced by First Lady Michelle Obama .
The winner of Project Runway :
Junior received a full scholarship to the prestigious Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising in California , a complete home sewing and crafting studio provided by Brother , a feature in Seventeen Magazine and a $ 25,000 cash prize to help launch their line plus a Visionworks shopping spree .
In May 2016 , Lifetime renewed Project Runway : Junior for a second and third season in a deal with The Weinstein Company .
