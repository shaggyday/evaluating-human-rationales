BRITISH UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE CLASSIFICATION
The British undergraduate degree classification system is a grading structure for undergraduate degrees or bachelor 's degrees and integrated master 's degrees in the United Kingdom .
The system has been applied ( sometimes with significant variations ) in other countries and regions .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The classification system as currently used in the United Kingdom was developed in 1918 .
Honours were then a means to recognise individuals who demonstrated depth of knowledge or originality , as opposed to relative achievement in examination conditions .
Concern exists about possible grade inflation .
It is claimed that academics are under increasing pressure from administrators to award students good marks and grades with little regard for those students ' actual abilities , in order to maintain their league table rankings .
It is also claimed that academics who enforce rigorous standards risk receiving poor student course evaluations .
The percentage of graduates who receive a First has grown from 7 % in 1997 to 26 % in 2017 , with the rate of growth sharply accelerating toward the end of this period .
A 2018 study by the UK Standing Committee for Quality Assessment concluded that improvements in faculty skill and student motivation are only two of many factors driving average grades upward , that grade inflation is real , that the British undergraduate degree classifications will become less useful to students and employers , and that inflation will undermine public confidence in the overall value of higher education .
Students already believe that a First or upper Second , by itself , is no longer sufficient to secure a good job , and that they need to engage in extra - curricular activities to build their CV .
DEGREE CLASSIFICATION Section::::Degree classification .
A bachelor 's degree can be an honours degree ( bachelor 's with honours ) or an ordinary degree ( bachelor 's without honours ) .
Honours degrees are classified , usually based on a weighted average ( with higher weight given to marks in the later years of the course , and often zero weight to those in the first year ) of the marks gained in exams and other assessments .
Grade boundaries can vary by institution , but typical values are given below .
* First - class honours ( 1st , 1 or I ) – typically 70 % or higher * Second - class honours ; * Upper division ( 2:1 , 2i or II-1 ) – typically 60–69 %
* Lower division ( 2:2 , 2ii or II-2 ) – typically 50–59 % * Third - class honours
( 3rd , 3 or III ) – typically 40–49 % Students who do not achieve honours may be awarded an ordinary degree , sometimes known as a " pass " .
Ordinary degrees , and other exit awards such as the Diploma of Higher Education ( DipHE ; for completing the first two years of a degree course ) and Certificate of Higher Education ( CertHE ; for completing the first year of a degree course ) , may be unclassified ( pass / fail ) or , particularly in Scotland where the ordinary degree is offered as a qualification in its own right , classified into pass , merit and distinction .
Foundation degrees are normally classified into pass , merit and distinction .
Integrated master 's degrees are usually classified with honours in the same way as a bachelor 's honours degree , although some integrated master 's degrees are classified like postgraduate taught master 's degrees into pass ( usually 50 % ) , merit ( 60 % ) and distinction ( 70 % ) .
At most institutions , the system allows a small amount of discretion .
A candidate may be elevated to the next degree class if his or her average marks are close to ( or the median of their weighted marks achieves ) the higher class , and if they have submitted several pieces of work worthy of the higher class .
However , even students with a high average mark may be unable to take honours if they have failed part of the course and so have insufficient credits .
In England , Wales and Northern Ireland , a bachelor 's degree with honours normally takes three years of full - time study and usually requires 360 credits , of which at least 90 are at level 6 ( final year of a bachelor 's degree ) level , while an ordinary bachelor 's degree normally requires 300 credits , of which 60 are at level 6 .
In Scotland , the honours bachelor 's degree takes four years and requires 480 credits with a minimum of 90 at level 10 of the Scottish framework ( last year of the honours degree ) and 90 at level 9 ( penultimate year ) , while the ordinary degree takes three years and requires 360 credits with a minimum of 60 at level 9 ( last year of the ordinary degree ) .
In Scotland , it is possible to start university a year younger than in the rest of the United Kingdom , as the Scottish Higher exams are often taken at age 16 or 17 ( as opposed to 18 ) , so Scottish students often end a four - year course at the same age as a student from elsewhere in the UK taking a three - year course , assuming no gap years or students skipping the first year ( direct entry to 2nd year ) .
When a candidate is awarded a degree with honours , " ( Hons ) " may be suffixed to their designatory letters — for example , BA ( Hons ) , BSc ( Hons ) , BMus ( Hons ) , MA ( Hons ) .
An MA ( Hons ) would generally indicate a degree award from certain Scottish universities ( c.f . Scottish MA ) and is at the same level as a bachelor 's degree .
DISTRIBUTION OF CLASSES Section::::Distribution of classes .
The Higher Education Statistics Agency ( HESA ) has published the number of degrees awarded with different classifications since 1994/5 .
The relative proportions of different classes have changed over this period , with increasing numbers of students being awarded higher honours .
The table below shows the percentage of classified degrees ( i.e. not including fails or unclassified degrees such as MBBS ) in each class at five year intervals ; note that HESA stopped giving statistics separately for third class honours and pass degree after 2003 and that a small number of undivided second class honours degrees ( shown under " other " along with " unknown " , which makes up the bulk of this category ) were awarded up to 1996 . !

First - class honours , referred to as a " first " , is the highest honours classification and indicates high academic achievement .
In 2010 and 2011 , the Higher Education Statistics Agency ( HESA ) reported that approximately 15 % of all degree candidates graduated with first - class honours .
The percentages of graduates achieving a first vary greatly by university and course studied .
For example , students of law are least likely to gain a first , whereas students of mathematical sciences are most likely to gain a first .
In 2006–2007 and 2010–2011 , 5.8 % and 8.1 % of law students gained a first , respectively ; however , in those years , 28.9 % and 30.0 % of mathematics students gained a first , respectively .
UPPER SECOND - CLASS HONOURS Section::::Upper second - class honours .
The upper division is commonly abbreviated to " 2:1 " or " II.i " ( pronounced two - one ) .
The 2:1 is a minimum requirement for entry to many postgraduate courses in the UK .
It is also required for the award of a research council postgraduate studentship in the UK , although possession of a master 's degree can render a candidate eligible for an award if their initial degree was below the 2:1 standard .
The percentage of candidates who achieve upper second - class honours can vary widely by degree subject , as well as by university .
LOWER SECOND - CLASS HONOURS Section::::Lower second - class honours .
This is the lower division of second - class degrees and is abbreviated as " 2:2 " or " II.ii " ( pronounced two - two ) .
It is also informally known as a " Desmond " , named after Desmond Tutu .
THIRD - CLASS HONOURS Section::::Third - class honours .
Third - class honours , referred to as a " third " , is the lowest honours classification in most modern universities .
Historically , the University of Oxford awarded fourth - class honours degrees and , until the late 1970s , did not distinguish between upper and lower second - class honours degrees .
Informally , the third - class honours degree is referred to as a " gentleman 's degree " ( cf .
the " gentleman 's C " in the U.S. ) .
Approximately 7.2 % of students graduating in 2006 with an honours degree received a third - class honours .
ORDINARY DEGREE
Section::::Ordinary degree .
While most university bachelor 's degree courses lead to honours degrees , some universities offer courses leading to ordinary degrees .
Some honours courses permit students who do not gain sufficient credits in a year by a small margin to transfer to a parallel ordinary degree course .
Ordinary degrees may also sometimes be awarded to honours degree students who do not pass sufficient credits in their final year to gain an honours degree , but pass enough to earn an ordinary degree .
Some Scottish universities offer three - year ordinary degrees as a qualification in their own right , as well as an honours degree over four years .
This is in contrast to English universities that have honours degrees with three years of study .
An ordinary degree in Scotland is not a failed honours degree , as in certain English universities .
Students can decide , usually at the end of their second or third year , whether or not they wish to complete a fourth honours year .
Scottish universities may also award their ordinary degrees with distinction if a student achieves a particularly good grade average , usually 70 % or above .
A common example of a Scottish ordinary degree is the Bachelor of Laws course taken by graduates of other subjects , as this is sufficient ( without honours ) for entry into the legal profession .
In other countries , Malawi for example , Mzuzu University offers four year ordinary degrees .
The degree follows the same classification as those in the United Kingdom .
Grades attained in the last two years ( year three and four ) including internship and dissertation , contribute to the final degree classification .
AEGROTAT
Section::::Aegrotat .
An aegrotat (; ) degree is an honours or ordinary degree without classification , awarded under the presumption that , had a candidate who was unable to undertake their exams due to illness or even death completed those exams , they would have satisfied the standard required for that degree .
Aegrotat degrees are often qualified with an appended " ( aegrotat ) " .
Following the introduction of current regulations regarding mitigating circumstances , aegrotat degrees are less commonly awarded than they previously were .
VARIATIONS IN CLASSIFICATION Section::::Variations in classification .
At the University of Cambridge , undergraduate Tripos examinations are split into three parts ( e.g. Part IA , IB , and II ) , or two parts ( Part I and II ) .
Part II is taken at the end of final year .
Each student receives a formal classification for each part ( i.e. Class I , II.I , II.II , or III ) .
Typically , the Part II grade that corresponds with final examinations is quoted , but officially a grade simply exists for every Part of the degree , not for the overall degree .
At the University of Oxford , a formal degree Class is given , and this is typically based on the final examinations .
In Oxford , examinations for Prelims or Honour Moderations are also undertaken in first / second year , but these results do not typically affect the final degree classification .
Until the 1970s , the four honours divisions in Oxford 's moderations and final examinations were named first , second , third and fourth class , but eventually Oxford gave in and adopted the numbering used by other English universities .
VARIATIONS OF FIRST - CLASS HONOURS Section::::Variations of first - class honours .
At the University of Cambridge , Triposes were previously split into two parts : Part I and Part II .
Attaining First Class Honours in both parts would culminate in graduating with a " Double First " .
Most Triposes were later split into three parts :
" Part IA , " " Part IB " and " Part II " , or " Part I " , " Part IIA " and " Part IIB " .
Attaining a First Class in all three parts culminates in graduating with a " Triple First " .
The frequency of this honour varies with subject , but typically fewer than 3 % of students will achieve this distinction .
It is possible in some of the humanities Triposes to be awarded a " Starred First " , for examination scripts that " consistently exhibit the qualities of first class answers to an exceptional degree .
"
The science Triposes do not award Starred Firsts .
Oxford sometimes grants a congratulatory first , which The New York Times described as " a highly unusual honor in which the examining professors ask no questions about the candidate 's written work but simply stand and applaud " , and Martin Amis described as " the sort where you are called in for a viva and the examiners tell you how much they enjoyed reading your papers " .
A " double first " at Oxford usually informally refers to first - class honours in both components of an undergraduate degree , i.e. Moderations / Prelims and the Final Honour School , or in both the bachelor 's and master 's components of an integrated master 's degree .
At University College London , candidates who perform well beyond the requirements of a standard First Class Honours may be nominated to the Dean 's List .
This is generated once per year and recognizes outstanding academic achievement in final examinations .
There are no set criteria for nomination to the list , but typically only a nominal number of students from each faculty are nominated per year .

The South African Qualifications Authority ( SAQA ) compares international degrees with local degrees before any international student continues their studies in that country .
While the British degree accreditation and classification system allows students to go straight from a three - year bachelor 's degree onto a master 's degree ( normally requiring a 1st or a 2:1 – those with a 2:2 or a 3rd usually require appropriate professional experience ) , South Africa does not do so unless the student has proven research capabilities .
South African Honours degrees prepare the students to undertake a research - specific degree ( in terms of master 's ) , by spending an in - depth year ( up to 5 modules ) creating research proposals and undertaking a research project of limited scope .
This prepares students for the research degrees later in their academic career .

UNITED STATES AND CANADA Section::::United States and Canada .
British honours degrees are sometimes considered equivalent ( by British sources ) to a US master 's degree , with the US bachelor 's degree being equivalent to a British pass degree , due to the much higher degree of specialisation in the UK .
However , many British institutions accept US bachelor 's degrees for admission to postgraduate study ( see below ) and US comparison services treat British and American degrees as equivalent .
When US bachelor 's degrees are compared to British honours degrees , equivalencies can be expressed in terms of either US Grade Point Averages ( GPAs ) or letter grades .
British institutions normally state equivalence in terms of GPAs .
Approximate mappings between British classifications and GPAs can be inferred from the graduate admissions criteria used by British universities , which often give international equivalents .
For example , University College London ( UCL ) equates the minimum classification for entrance to GPAs using 1st =
3.6 ,
2:1 = 3.3 and 2:2
= 3.0 .
However , different universities convert grades differently : the London School of Economics and Political Science ( LSE ) considers a GPA ( U.S. ) of 3.5 or better as equivalent to gaining a 2:1 , while the department of English Language and Literature at Oxford considers a GPA of " about 3.8 " equivalent to a first class degree .
Similarly , the UK NARIC gives equivalent GPAs for determining eligibility for teacher training bursaries .
In contrast , Durham University 's North American Undergraduate Guide 2017 gives a conversion table as a guide to understanding British classifications ( rather than for admission to postgraduate study ) of 1st = 3.8–4.0 , 2:1 = 3.3–3.7 , 2:2 = 2.8–3.2 and 3rd = 2.3–2.7 .
The GPA conversions are summarised in the following table : !

The 4-point GPAs are sometimes seen to differ from the US but other sources treat them as equivalent .
The Durham conversion specifies GPAs for the US and letter grades / percentages for Canada while the UK NARIC has separate GPA conversions for the four - year bachelor 's honours , baccalauréat and professional bachelor 's degrees ( which differ from their US GPA equivalents by at most 0.1 ) and the three - year bachelor 's degree ( which is seen as a lower standard ) .
The British Graduate Admissions Fact Sheet from McGill University uses the conversion 1st = 4.0 ; 2:1 = 3.0 ; 2:2 = 2.7 ; 3rd = 2.0 ; Pass = 1.0 ; Fail = 0.0 . !

Bachelor 's degrees ( including the Scottish MA , but not including medical degrees , dentistry degrees or degrees in veterinary science ) attained in the UK are at FHEQ level 6 / FQHEIS level 9 ( ordinary ) or 10 ( honours ) ; master 's degrees ( including integrated master 's degrees and first degrees in medicine , dentistry and veterinary science ) are at FHEQ level 7 / FQHEIS level 11 , and doctoral degrees are at FHEQ level 8 / FQHEIS level 12 .
Bachelor 's , master 's and doctoral degrees map to first , second and third cycle qualifications in the Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area .
PROGRESSION TO POSTGRADUATE STUDY Section::::Progression to postgraduate study .
Regulations governing the progression of undergraduate degree graduates to postgraduate programmes vary among universities , and are often flexible .
A candidate for a postgraduate master 's degree is usually required to have at least a 2:2 bachelor honours degree , although candidates with 2:1s are in a considerably stronger position to gain a place in a postgraduate course and to obtain funding , especially in medical and natural sciences .
Some institutions specify a 2:1 minimum for certain types of master 's program , such as for a Master of Research course .
Candidates with a Third or an Ordinary degree are sometimes accepted , provided they have acquired satisfactory professional experience subsequent to graduation .
A candidate for a doctoral programme who does not hold a master 's degree is nearly always required to have a First or 2:1 at bachelor 's level .
VARIATIONS INTERNATIONAL DEGREES AUSTRALIA Section::::Variations .
Section::::International degrees .
Section::::Australia .
Some universities , such as those in Australia , offer ordinary or pass degrees , ( for instance , as a three - year B.A. or a three - year BSc ) by default .
High - achieving students may be recognised with an honours classification without further coursework or research , as is often the case in engineering , which often contains a research and thesis component , or law .
However , other courses ( such as humanities , arts , social sciences , and sciences ) and other universities may recognise high - achieving students with an honours classification with further coursework or research , undertaken either concurrently with , and as part of or in addition to , a bachelor 's course , or after completion of a bachelor 's course requirements and attaining adequately competitive grades .
Some graduate degrees have been or are classified ; however , under the Australian Qualifications Framework ( AQF ) , no graduate - level degrees ( i.e. , master 's by coursework , master 's by research , or higher research degrees ) may be classified .
To comply with this standard , some institutions have commenced , or will commence , offering high - achieving graduates with " distinction " .
Notably , this is consistent with British graduate degree classification .
BRITISH MEDICAL AND DENTAL DEGREES Section::::British medical and dental degrees .
In the United Kingdom , medicine is usually taught as an undergraduate course , with graduates being awarded a master 's level qualification : normally the conjoined degrees of Bachelor of Medicine , Bachelor of Surgery ( MBBS , BM BCh , MB ChB , etc . )
although at Queen 's University Belfast ( and universities in Ireland ) Bachelor in the Art of Obstetrics ( BAO ) is added , and at some universities only the Bachelor of Medicine is awarded - all of these have equal standing .
Unlike most undergraduate degrees , the MBBS is not normally considered an honours degree , and thus is not classified into first class honours , etc .
Students may be awarded " Merits " and " Distinctions " for parts of the course or the whole course ( depending on the institution ) and " Honours " may be awarded at some institutions for exceptional performance throughout the course ( as a grade above Distinction ) .
Medical schools split their year groups into one of 10 deciles .
These deciles are the major factor in the calculation of Educational Performance Measure ( EPM ) points used as part of medical students ' Foundation Programme applications , with the top decile receiving 43 points , decreasing by a point for each decile ( so the lowest gets 34 points ) ; 7 points can be awarded for other educational achievements ( other degrees and publications ) , and the EPM points are combined with up to 50 points from the Situational Judgement Test to give a total out of 100 .
BRITISH GRADE POINT
AVERAGE Section::::British Grade Point Average .
Following the recommendation of the Burgess report into the honours degree classification system in 2007 , the Higher Education Academy ran a pilot in 2013–2014 in collaboration with 21 institutions delivering higher education ( ranging from Russell Group universities to Further Education colleges ) to investigate how a Grade Point Average ( GPA ) system would work best in Britain .
Two main weighting systems were tested : an American - style average of all marks , weighted only by credit value , and weighting by " exit velocity " in the manner of the honours classification , where modules in the first year are given a low or zero weight and modules in the final year have a higher weight ( a third model was only rarely used ) .
Over two thirds of providers preferred exit - velocity weighting to the straight average .
A GPA scale , tied to percentage marks and letter grades , was recommended for use nationally following the study , to run in parallel with the honours degree classification system . !
