RAY GUY William Ray Guy ( born December 22 , 1949 ) is a former American football punter for the Oakland / Los Angeles Raiders of the National Football League ( NFL ) .
Guy was a unanimous All - American selection in 1972 as a senior at the University of Southern Mississippi , and was the first pure punter ever to be drafted in the first round of the NFL Draft , when the Oakland Raiders selected him with the 23rd overall pick in 1973 .
Guy was elected to both the College Football Hall of Fame and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2014 .
A six - time NFL All - Pro , Guy is widely considered to be the greatest punter of all time .
With his induction to the Hall of Fame on August 2 , 2014 , he became only the second pure kicker ( after Jan Stenerud ) and the first pure punter so honored .
COLLEGE CAREER
Section::::College career .
He was both a punter and a placekicker at Southern Mississippi , once kicking a then - record 61-yard field goal in a snowstorm during a game in Utah .
In 1972 , he kicked a 93-yard punt in a game against the University of Mississippi .
After his senior season at Southern Miss , Guy was named Most Valuable Player of the 1973 Chicago College All - Star Game , in which an all - star team of college seniors played the current Super Bowl champion .
He was also a starting safety at Southern Miss ; during his senior season , he intercepted a USM record eight passes , and was named an All - American defensive back .
PROFESSIONAL CAREER Section::::Professional career .
Guy was the first punter ever to be selected in the first round in the NFL Draft , in 1973 .
Ray Guy was selected to seven Pro Bowl teams , and in 1994 , he was named the punter on the National Football League 's 75th Anniversary Team .
His trademark was kicking punts that stayed in the air for so long that by the time the punt returner was able to field it , the Raiders ' coverage unit had the field covered so well that a return was not possible .
Guy 's punts often left opposing offenses pinned in their own end of the field .
The statistic for hang time was instituted in the NFL during his career , reportedly because of him .
Joe Horrigan , the historian of the Pro Football Hall of Fame once said : " He 's the first punter you could look at and say : ' He won games . ' "
In Super Bowl XVIII , Guy punted seven times for 299 yards ( 42.7 average ) , with 244 net yards ( 34.8 average ) and planted five of his seven punts inside the 20 .
Due in part to his effective punting , the Los Angeles Raiders easily won the game , 38 - 9 .
Guy also played quarterback in his early years ; for much of his career he was the Raiders ' emergency quarterback , replacing kicker - quarterback George Blanda in this position .
During the early part of Guy 's career , he would occasionally do kickoffs for the Raiders because the aging Blanda no longer had great range .
At the 1976 Pro Bowl , Guy became the first punter to hit the Louisiana Superdome video screen .
Officials raised the screen from 90 feet to 200 feet .
The NFC team pulled the ball and had it tested for helium ; it was filled with regular air .
In his 13-year career , Guy : * Played in 207 consecutive games * Punted 1,049 times for 44,493 yards , averaging 42.4 yards per punt , with a 33.8 net yards average * Had 210 punts inside the 20-yard line ( not counting his first 3 seasons , when the NFL did not keep track of this stat ) , with just 128 touchbacks
* Led the NFL in punting three times
* Had a streak of 619 consecutive punts before having one blocked * Has a record of 111 career punts in post season games
* Had five punts of over 60 yards during the 1981 season HALL OF FAME Section::::Hall of Fame .
Guy was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of the class of 2014 on August 2 , 2014 .
For many years before his induction in 2014 , he was considered one of the most worthy players who had not yet been selected for the Pro Football Hall of Fame .
In 1994 , he was the first pure punter to be nominated for enshrinement .
In his enshrinement speech , he proudly proclaimed , " Now the Hall of Fame has a complete team . "
Guy has been inducted into both the Mississippi and Georgia Sports Halls of Fame , the National High School Sports Hall of Fame , and the College Football Hall of Fame .
On April 21 , 2008 , Guy was inducted into the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame .
