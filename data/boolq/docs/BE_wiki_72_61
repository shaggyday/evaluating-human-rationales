PYRUVATE DEHYDROGENASE COMPLEX
Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex ( PDC ) is a complex of three enzymes that converts pyruvate into acetyl - CoA by a process called pyruvate decarboxylation .
Acetyl - CoA may then be used in the citric acid cycle to carry out cellular respiration , and this complex links the glycolysis metabolic pathway to the citric acid cycle .
Pyruvate decarboxylation is also known as the " pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction " because it also involves the oxidation of pyruvate .
This multi - enzyme complex is related structurally and functionally to the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and branched - chain oxo - acid dehydrogenase multi - enzyme complexes .

Section::::Pyruvate dehydrogenase ( E1 ) .
Initially , pyruvate and thiamine pyrophosphate ( TPP or vitamin B ) are bound by pyruvate dehydrogenase subunits .
The thiazolium ring of TPP is in a zwitterionic form , and the anionic C2 carbon performs a nucleophilic attack on the C2 ( ketone ) carbonyl of pyruvate .
The resulting hemithioacetal undergoes decarboxylation to produce an acyl anion equivalent ( see cyanohydrin or aldehyde - dithiane umpolung chemistry , as well as benzoin condensation ) .
This anion attacks S1 of an oxidized lipoate species that is attached to a lysine residue .
In a ring - opening S2-like mechanism , S2 is displaced as a sulfide or sulfhydryl moiety .
Subsequent collapse of the tetrahedral hemithioacetal ejects thiazole , releasing the TPP cofactor and generating a thioacetate on S1 of lipoate .
The E1-catalyzed process is the rate - limiting step of the whole pyruvate dehydrogenase complex .
DIHYDROLIPOYL TRANSACETYLASE ( E2 )
Section::::Dihydrolipoyl transacetylase ( E2 ) .
At this point , the lipoate - thioester functionality is translocated into the dihydrolipoyl transacetylase ( E2 ) active site , where a transacylation reaction transfers the acetyl from the " swinging arm " of lipoyl to the thiol of coenzyme A. This produces acetyl - CoA , which is released from the enzyme complex and subsequently enters the citric acid cycle .
E2 can also be known as lipoamide reductase - transacetylase .
DIHYDROLIPOYL DEHYDROGENASE ( E3 )
Section::::Dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase ( E3 ) .
The dihydrolipoate , still bound to a lysine residue of the complex , then migrates to the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase ( E3 ) active site where it undergoes a flavin - mediated oxidation , identical in chemistry to disulfide isomerase .
First , FAD oxidizes dihydrolipoate back to its lipoate resting state , producing FADH .
Then , a NAD cofactor oxidizes FADH back to its FAD resting state , producing NADH .
STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN SPECIES
Section::::Structural differences between species .
PDC is a large complex composed of multiple copies of 3 or 4 subunits depending on species .
GRAM - NEGATIVE
BACTERIA Section::::Gram - negative bacteria .
In Gram - negative bacteria , e.g. Escherichia coli , PDC consists of a central cubic core made up from 24 molecules of dihydrolipoyl transacetylase ( E2 ) .
Up to 24 copies of pyruvate dehydrogenase ( E1 ) and 12 molecules of dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase ( E3 ) bind to the outside of the E2 core .
GRAM - POSITIVE BACTERIA AND EUKARYOTES Section::::Gram - positive bacteria and eukaryotes .
In contrast , in Gram - positive bacteria ( e.g. Bacillus stearothermophilus ) and eukaryotes the central PDC core contains 60 E2 molecules arranged into an icosahedron .
Eukaryotes also contain 12 copies of an additional core protein , E3 binding protein ( E3BP ) .
The exact location of E3BP is not completely clear .
Cryo - electron microscopy has established that E3BP binds to each of the icosahedral faces in yeast .
However , it has been suggested that it replaces an equivalent number of E2 molecules in the bovine PDC core .
Up to 60 E1 or E3 molecules can associate with the E2 core from Gram - positive bacteria - binding is mutually exclusive .
In eukaryotes E1 is specifically bound by E2 , while E3 associates with E3BP .
It is thought that up to 30 E1 and 6 E3 enzymes are present , although the exact number of molecules can vary in vivo and often reflects the metabolic requirements of the tissue in question .
REGULATION Section::::Regulation .
Pyruvate dehydrogenase is inhibited when one or more of the three following ratios are increased : ATP / ADP , NADH / NAD and acetyl - CoA /
CoA.
In eukaryotes PDC is tightly regulated by its own specific pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase ( PDK ) and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase ( PDP ) , deactivating and activating it respectively .
* PDK phosphorylates three specific serine residues on E1 with different affinities .
Phosphorylation of any one of them renders E1 ( and in consequence the entire complex ) inactive .
* Dephosphorylation of E1 by PDP reinstates complex activity .
Products of the reaction act as allosteric inhibitors of the PDC , because they activate PDK .
Substrates in turn
inhibit PDK , and thus , reactivating PDC .
During starvation , PDK increases in amount in most tissues , including skeletal muscle , via increased gene transcription .
Under the same conditions , the amount of PDP decreases .
The resulting inhibition of PDC prevents muscle and other tissues from catabolizing glucose and gluconeogenesis precursors .
Metabolism shifts toward fat utilization , while muscle protein breakdown to supply gluconeogenesis precursors is minimized , and available glucose is spared for use by the brain .
Calcium ion has a role in regulation of PDC in muscle tissue , because it activates PDP , stimulating glycolysis on its release into the cytosol - during muscle contraction .
Some products of these transcriptions release H2 into the muscles .
This can cause calcium ions to decay over time .
LOCALIZATION OF PYRUVATE
DECARBOXYLATION Section::::Localization of pyruvate decarboxylation .
In eukaryotic cells the pyruvate decarboxylation occurs inside the mitochondrial matrix , after transport of the substrate , pyruvate , from the cytosol .
The transport of pyruvate into the mitochondria is via the transport protein pyruvate translocase .
Pyruvate translocase transports pyruvate in a symport fashion with a proton , and hence is active , consuming energy .
Upon entry to the mitochondria , the pyruvate is decarboxylated , producing acetyl - CoA.
This irreversible reaction traps the acetyl - CoA within the mitochondria ( the acetyl - CoA can only be transported out of the mitochondrial matrix under conditions of high oxaloacetate via the citrate shuttle , a TCA intermediate that is normally sparse ) .
The carbon dioxide produced by this reaction is nonpolar and small , and can diffuse out of the mitochondria and out of the cell .
In prokaryotes , which have no mitochondria , this reaction is either carried out in the cytosol , or not at all .
CLINICAL RELEVANCE Section::::Clinical relevance .
Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency can result from mutations in any of the enzymes or cofactors .
Its primary clinical finding is lactic acidosis .
