RECEPTION Section::::Reception .
Cedar Cove was given " generally favorable " reviews at the Metacritic website , based on the aggregate score of 62 out of 100 from ten critics .

"
Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times commented , " Despite a certain built - in B&B preciousness , Cedar Cove evokes certain splendid shows of another time and place , including the late - great Family and the longtime Irish hit Ballykissangel . ' "
The New York Timess Neil Genzlinger commented that the " able " cast " makes it stand out from the stream of interchangeable Hallmark movies that aim for the same tone and audience . "
Ellen Gray of the Philadelphia Daily News commented on the difference between Hallmark 's standard fare and Cedar Cove , " While [ Hallmark ] movies are often forced to rush headlong toward their happy endings , a series can take more time .
And in [ the ] four subsequent episodes I 've seen , the stories and characters get to breathe a bit . "
The New York Posts Linda Stasi stated , " It ai n't brain surgery and nobody 's going to win any Emmys , but that 's not why fans watch Hallmark .
"

there 's every indication a Hallmark series will be the same sort of television comfort food as a Hallmark movie . "
The Pittsburgh Post - Gazettes Rob Owen called the series " comfortable , uncomplicated , unchallenging entertainment , " adding , " which makes it ideal for Hallmark 's brand .
Fans of Hallmark 's movies will enjoy it ; viewers who want to be more engaged and absorbed by a program may be bored . "
Brian Lowry of Variety
stated,"There 's still a distinction to be drawn between ' light ' and ' weightless , ' which is roughly where this new show registers â€” in part because the Olivia - Jack relationship is the only aspect with any resonance . "
