ROCKY Rocky is a 1976 American sports drama film directed by John G. Avildsen and both written by and starring Sylvester Stallone .
It tells the rags to riches American Dream story of Rocky Balboa , an uneducated but kind - hearted working class Italian - American boxer working as a debt collector for a loan shark in the slums of Philadelphia .
Rocky , a small - time club fighter , gets a shot at the world heavyweight championship .
The film also stars Talia Shire as Adrian , Burt Young as Adrian 's brother Paulie , Burgess Meredith as Rocky 's trainer Mickey Goldmill , and Carl Weathers as the champion , Apollo Creed .
The film , made on a budget of just over $ 1 million , was a sleeper hit ; it earned $ 225 million in global box office receipts , becoming the highest - grossing film of 1976 , and went on to win three Oscars , including Best Picture .
The film received many positive reviews and turned Stallone into a major movie star .
In 2006 , the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being " culturally , historically or aesthetically significant " .
Rocky is considered to be one of the greatest sports films ever made and was ranked as the second - best in the genre , after Raging Bull , by the American Film Institute in 2008 .
The film has spawned seven sequels : Rocky II ( 1979 ) , Rocky III ( 1982 ) , Rocky IV ( 1985 ) , Rocky V ( 1990 ) , Rocky Balboa ( 2006 ) , Creed ( 2015 ) and Creed II ( 2018 ) .
Stallone portrays Rocky in all seven sequels , wrote the first five , and directed four ( Avildsen returned to direct Rocky V and Ryan Coogler directed Creed ) .
An eighth film and direct sequel to Creed , titled Creed II , was released in 2018 with Steven Caple Jr. directing and Stallone returning to star and writing the script .
PLOT Section::::Plot .
In late 1975 , the heavyweight boxing world champion , Apollo Creed , announces plans to hold a title bout in Philadelphia during the upcoming United States Bicentennial .
However , he is informed five weeks from the fight date that his scheduled opponent is unable to compete due to an injured hand .
With all other potential replacements booked up or otherwise unavailable , Creed decides to spice things up by giving a local contender a chance to challenge him .
He settles in on Robert " Rocky " Balboa , an aspiring southpaw boxer from an Italian neighborhood of Philadelphia , known by the nickname " The Italian Stallion " .
Rocky meets with promoter Miles Jergens , unexpectedly presuming Creed is seeking local sparring partners .
Reluctant at first , Rocky eventually agrees to the fight which will pay him $ 150,000 .
After several weeks of training , using whatever he can find , including meat carcasses as punching bags , Rocky accepts an offer of assistance from former boxer Mickey " Mighty Mick " Goldmill , a respected trainer and former bantamweight fighter from the 1920s , who always criticized Rocky for wasting his potential .
Meanwhile , Rocky meets Adrian Pennino , who is working part - time at the J&M Tropical Fish pet store .
He begins to build a romantic relationship with Adrian , culminating in a kiss .
Adrian 's brother , Paulie , becomes jealous of Rocky 's success , but Rocky calms him by agreeing to advertise his meatpacking business before the upcoming fight .
The night before the fight , Rocky begins to lose confidence after touring the arena .
He confesses to Adrian that he does not expect to win , but is content to go the distance against Creed and prove himself to everyone .
On New Year 's Day , the fight is held , with Creed making a dramatic entrance dressed as George Washington and then Uncle Sam .
Taking advantage of his overconfidence , Rocky knocks him down in the first round — the first time that Creed has ever been knocked down .
Humiliated , Creed takes Rocky more seriously for the rest of the fight , though his ego never fully fades .
The fight goes on for the full fifteen rounds , with both combatants sustaining various injuries , Rocky with a detached retina in his right eye and hits to the head , and Apollo with internal bleeding and a broken rib .
As the fight progresses , Creed 's superior skill is countered by Rocky 's apparently unlimited ability to absorb punches , and his dogged refusal to go down .
As the final round bell sounds , with both fighters locked in each other 's arms , they promise to each other that there will be no rematch .
After the fight , the sportscasters and the audience go wild .
Jergens announces over the loudspeaker that the fight was " the greatest exhibition of guts and stamina in the history of the ring " , and Rocky calls out repeatedly for Adrian , who runs down and comes into the ring as Paulie distracts arena security .
As Jergens declares Creed the winner by virtue of a split decision ( 8:7 , 7:8 , 9:6 ) , Adrian and Rocky embrace and profess their love to each other , not caring about the result of the fight .
PRODUCTION
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Production .
Section::::Development .
Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay for Rocky in three and a half days , shortly after watching the championship match between Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner that took place at Richfield Coliseum in Richfield , Ohio on March 24 , 1975 .
Wepner was TKO'd in the 15th round of the match by Ali , with few expecting him to last as long as he did .
Despite the fact that the match motivated Stallone to begin work on Rocky , he has subsequently denied that Wepner provided any inspiration for the script .
Other possible inspirations for the film may have included characteristics of real - life boxers Rocky Marciano and Joe Frazier , as well as Rocky Graziano 's autobiography Somebody
Up There Likes Me and the movie of the same name .
Wepner filed a lawsuit which was eventually settled with Stallone for an undisclosed amount .
United Artists liked Stallone 's script , and viewed it as a possible vehicle for a well - established star such as Robert Redford , Ryan O'Neal , Burt Reynolds , or James Caan .
Stallone insisted upon portraying the title character himself , to the point of issuing an ultimatum .
Stallone later said that he would never have forgiven himself , had the film become a success with somebody else in the lead .
He also knew that producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff 's contract with the studio enabled them to " greenlight " a project if the budget was kept low enough .
The producers also collateralized any possible losses with their big - budget entry , New York , New York ( whose eventual losses were covered by Rocky success ) .
The film 's production budget ended up being $ 1,075,000 , with a further $ 100,000 spent on producers ' fees and $ 4.2 million on advertising costs .
CASTING
Section::::Casting . !
Actor !
Role Although Chartoff and Winkler were enthusiastic about the script and the idea of Stallone playing the lead character , they were hesitant about having an unknown headline the film .
The producers also had trouble casting other major characters in the story , with Apollo Creed and Adrian cast unusually late by production standards ( both were ultimately cast on the same day ) .
Real - life boxer Ken Norton was initially sought for the role of Apollo Creed , but he pulled out and the role was ultimately given to Carl Weathers .
Norton had had three fights with Muhammad Ali , upon whom Creed was loosely based .
According to The Rocky Scrapbook , Carrie Snodgress was originally chosen to play Adrian , but a money dispute forced the producers to look elsewhere .
Susan Sarandon auditioned for the role but was deemed too pretty for the character .
After Talia Shire 's ensuing audition , Chartoff and Winkler , along with Avildsen , insisted that she play the part .
Boxer Joe Frazier has a cameo appearance in the film .
The character of Apollo Creed was influenced by outspoken boxer Muhammad Ali who fought Frazier three times .
During the 49th Academy Awards ceremony in 1977 , Ali and Stallone staged a brief comic confrontation to show Ali was not offended by the film .
Some of the plot 's most memorable moments — Rocky 's carcass - punching scenes and Rocky running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art , as part of his training regimen — are taken from the real - life exploits of Joe Frazier , for which he received no credit .
Due to the film 's comparatively low budget , members of Stallone 's family played minor roles .
His father rings the bell to signal the start and end of a round , his brother Frank plays a street corner singer , and his first wife , Sasha , was stills photographer .
Other cameos include former Philadelphia and then - current Los Angeles television sportscaster Stu Nahan playing himself , alongside radio and TV broadcaster Bill Baldwin ; and Lloyd Kaufman , founder of the independent film company Troma , appearing as a drunk .
Diana Lewis , then a news anchor in Los Angeles and later in Detroit , has a small scene as a TV news reporter .
Tony Burton appeared as Apollo Creed 's trainer , Tony " Duke " Evers , a role he would reprise in the entire Rocky series , though he is not given an official name until Rocky II .
Though uncredited , Michael Dorn , who would later gain fame as the Klingon Worf in and , made his acting debut as Creed 's bodyguard .
FILMING
Section::::Filming .
Principal photography for Rocky began on January 9 , 1976 .
Filming took place primarily throughout Philadelphia , with a few scenes being shot in Los Angeles .
Inventor / operator Garrett Brown 's new Steadicam was used to accomplish smooth photography while running alongside Rocky during the film 's Philadelphia street jogging / training sequences and the run up the Art Museum 's flight of stairs , now colloquially known as the Rocky Steps .
It was also used for some of the shots in the fight scenes and can be seen at the ringside during some wide shots of the final fight .
Rocky is often erroneously cited as the first film to use the Steadicam , although it was actually the third , after Bound for Glory and Marathon Man .
Certain elements of the story were altered during filming .
The original script had a darker tone : Mickey was portrayed as racist , and the script ended with Rocky throwing the fight after realizing he did not want to be part of the professional boxing world after all .
During filming , both Stallone and Weathers suffered injuries during the shooting of the final fight ; Stallone suffered bruised ribs and Weathers suffered a damaged nose , the opposite injuries of what their characters had .
The first date between Rocky and Adrian , in which Rocky bribes a janitor to allow them to skate after closing hours in a deserted ice skating rink , was shot that way only because of budgetary pressures .
This scene was originally scheduled to be shot in a skating rink during regular business hours .
However , the producers decided that they could not afford to hire the hundreds of extras that would have been necessary for that scene .
The poster seen above the ring before Rocky fights Apollo Creed shows Rocky wearing red shorts with a white stripe when he actually wears white shorts with a red stripe .
When Rocky points this out , he is told that " it does n't really matter , does it ? "
According to director Avildsen 's DVD commentary , this was an actual mistake made by the props department that they could not afford to rectify , so Stallone wrote the brief scene to ensure the audience did not see it as a goof .
( Carl Weathers , coincidentally , wore white - striped red shorts for the Creed - Balboa rematch in Rocky II . )
Avildsen said that the same situation arose with Rocky 's robe .
When it came back from the costume department , it was far too baggy for Stallone .
Because the robe arrived on the day of filming the scene and there was no chance of replacing or altering it , instead of ignoring this and risking the audience laughing at it , Stallone wrote the dialogue where Rocky himself points out the robe is too big .
MUSIC Section::::Music .
The musical score for Rocky was composed by Bill Conti , who previously composed a score for director John G. Avildsen 's W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings ( 1975 ) that was ultimately rejected by the studio .
In fact , David Shire ( then - husband of Talia Shire ) was the first to be offered the chance to compose the music for Rocky but had to turn it down due to prior commitments .
Thus , Avildsen reached out to Conti without any studio intervention due to the film 's relatively low budget .
" The budget for the music was 25 grand , " said Avildsen .
" And that was for everything : The composer 's fee , that was to pay the musicians , that was to rent the studio , that was to buy the tape that it was going to be recorded on . "
The main theme song , " Gon na Fly Now " , made it to number one on the Billboard magazine 's Hot 100 list for one week ( from July 2 to July 8 , 1977 ) and the American Film Institute placed it 58th on its AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Songs .
A soundtrack album was released on November 12 , 1976 by United Artists Records .
The album was re - released in 1988 by EMI on CD and cassette .
RECEPTION BOX OFFICE Section::::Reception .
Section::::Box office .
Rocky grossed $ 5 million during its opening weekend and consistently performed well for 8 months and eventually reached $ 117 million at the North American box office .
Adjusted for inflation , the film earned over $ 500 million in North America at 2018 prices .
Overseas Rocky fared just as well , grossing $ 107 million for a worldwide box office accumulation of $ 225 million .
With its production budget of $ 1 million , Rocky is notable for its worldwide percentage return of over 11,000 percent .
It was the highest - grossing film released in 1976 in the United States and Canada and the second highest - grossing film of 1977 .
CRITICAL RESPONSE
Section::::Critical response .
Rocky received positive reviews at the time of its release .
Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun - Times gave it 4 out of 4 stars and said that Stallone reminded him of " the young Marlon Brando . "
Box Office Magazine claimed that audiences would be " touting Sylvester ' Sly ' Stallone as a new star " .
Frank Rich liked the film , calling it " almost 100 per cent schmaltz , " but favoring it over the cynicism that was prevalent in movies at that time , although he referred to the plot as " gimmicky " and the script " heavy - handed " .
Several reviews , including Richard Eder 's ( as well as Canby 's negative review ) , compared the work to that of Frank Capra .
The film , however , did not escape criticism .
Vincent Canby , of The New York Times , called it " pure ' 30s make believe " and dismissed both Stallone 's acting and Avildsen 's directing , calling the latter " none too decisive " .
Andrew Sarris found the Capra comparisons disingenuous : " Capra 's movies projected more despair deep down than a movie like Rocky could envisage , and most previous ring movies have been much more cynical about the fight scene , " and , commenting on Rocky 's work as a loan shark , says that the film " teeters on the edge of sentimentalizing gangsters . "
Sarris also found Meredith " oddly cast in the kind of part the late James Gleason used to pick his teeth . "
Four decades later , the film enjoys a reputation as a classic and still receives nearly universal praise ; Rocky holds a 93 % " Certified Fresh " rating on Rotten Tomatoes , based on 57 reviews , with an average rating of 8.4/10 .
The site 's consensus states : " This story of a down - on - his - luck boxer is thoroughly predictable , but Sylvester Stallone 's script and stunning performance in the title role brush aside complaints . "
One of the positive online reviews came from the BBC Films website , with both reviewer Almar Haflidason and BBC online users giving it 5/5 stars .
In Steven J. Schneider 's 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die , Schneider says the film is " often overlooked as schmaltz . "
In 2006 , Rocky was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being " culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant " .

Section::::Rocky Steps .
The famous scene of Rocky running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art has become a cultural icon , with the steps acquiring the vernacular title of " Rocky Steps " .
In 1982 , a statue of Rocky , commissioned by Stallone for Rocky III , was placed at the top of the Rocky Steps .
City Commerce Director Dick Doran claimed that Stallone and Rocky had done more for the city 's image than " anyone since Ben Franklin . "
Differing opinions of the statue and its placement led to a relocation to the sidewalk outside the Spectrum Arena , although the statue was temporarily returned to the top of the steps in 1990 for Rocky V , and again in 2006 for the 30th anniversary of the original Rocky ( although this time it was placed at the bottom of the steps ) .
Later that year , it was permanently moved to a spot next to the steps .
The scene is frequently parodied in the media .
In the 2008 movie You Do n't Mess with the Zohan , Zohan 's nemesis , Phantom , goes through a parodied training sequence finishing with him running up a desert dune and raising his hands in victory .
In the fourth - season finale of The Fresh Prince of Bel - Air , as the credits roll at the end of the episode , Will is seen running up the same steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art ; however , as he celebrates after finishing his climb , he passes out in exhaustion , and while he lies unconscious on the ground , a pickpocket steals his wallet and his wool hat .
In The Nutty Professor , there is a scene where Sherman Klump ( Eddie Murphy ) struggles to and eventually succeeds at running up a lengthy flight of steps on his college campus , victoriously throwing punches at the top .
In 2006 , E ! named the " Rocky Steps " scene # 13 in its 101 Most Awesome Moments in Entertainment .
During the 1996 Summer Olympics torch relay , Philadelphia native Dawn Staley was chosen to run up the museum steps .
In 2004 , Presidential candidate John Kerry ended his pre - convention campaign at the foot of the steps before going to Boston to accept his party 's nomination for President .
