MANNITOL SALT AGAR
Mannitol salt agar or MSA is a commonly used selective and differential growth medium in microbiology .
It encourages the growth of a group of certain bacteria while inhibiting the growth of others .
This medium is important in medical laboratories as one method of distinguishing pathogenic microbes in a short period of time .
It contains a high concentration ( about 7.5%-10 % ) of salt ( NaCl ) , making it selective for Gram - positive bacteria ( Staphylococcus and Micrococcaceae ) since this level of salt is inhibitory to most other bacteria .
It is also a differential medium for mannitol - fermenting staphylococci , containing carbohydrate mannitol and the indicator phenol red , a pH indicator for detecting acid produced by mannitol - fermenting staphylococci .
Staphylococcus aureus produces yellow colonies with yellow zones , whereas othercoagulase - negative staphylococci produce small pink or red colonies with no colour change to the medium .
If an organism can ferment mannitol , an acidic byproduct is formed that causes the phenol red in the agar to turn yellow .
It is used for the selective isolation of presumptive pathogenic ( pp ) Staphylococcus species .
EXPECTED RESULTS
* Gram + Staphylococcus : fermenting mannitol : medium turns yellow ( e.g. S. aureus )
* Gram + Staphylococcus : not fermenting mannitol , medium does not change color ( e.g. S. epidermidis )
* Gram + Streptococcus : inhibited growth
* Gram - : inhibited growth TYPICAL COMPOSITION Section::::Typical composition .
