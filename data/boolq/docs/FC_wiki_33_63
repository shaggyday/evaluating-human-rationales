MAGNETIC RESONANCE
SPECTROSCOPIC IMAGING
Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging ( MRSI ) is a noninvasive imaging method that provides spectroscopic information in addition to the image that is generated by MRI alone .
Whereas traditional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) generates a black - and - white image in which brightness is determined primarily by the T1 or T2 relaxation times of the tissue being imaged , the spectroscopic information obtained in an MRSI study can be used to infer further information about cellular activity ( metabolic information ) .
For example , in the context of oncology , an MRI scan may reveal the shape and size of a tumor , while an MRSI study provides additional information about the metabolic activity occurring in the tumor .
MRSI can be performed on a standard MRI scanner , and the patient experience is the same for MRSI as for MRI .
MRSI has broad applications in medicine , including oncology and general physiological studies .
When hydrogen is the target element , MRSI is also called 1H - nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging .
MRSI can also be performed with phosphorus , or hyperpolarized carbon-13 .
