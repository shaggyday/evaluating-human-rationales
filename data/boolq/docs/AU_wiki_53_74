LARAMIDE OROGENY
The Laramide orogeny was a period of mountain building in western North America , which started in the Late Cretaceous , 70 to 80 million years ago , and ended 35 to 55 million years ago .
The exact duration and ages of beginning and end of the orogeny are in dispute .
The Laramide orogeny occurred in a series of pulses , with quiescent phases intervening .
The major feature that was created by this orogeny was deep - seated , thick - skinned deformation , with evidence of this orogeny found from Canada to northern Mexico , with the easternmost extent of the mountain - building represented by the Black Hills of South Dakota .
The phenomenon is named for the Laramie Mountains of eastern Wyoming .
The Laramide orogeny is sometimes confused with the Sevier orogeny , which partially overlapped in time and space .
The orogeny is commonly attributed to events off the west coast of North America , where the Kula and Farallon Plates were sliding under the North American plate .
Most hypotheses propose that oceanic crust was undergoing flat - slab subduction , i.e. , with a shallow subduction angle , and as a consequence , no magmatism occurred in the central west of the continent , and the underlying oceanic lithosphere actually caused drag on the root of the overlying continental lithosphere .
One cause for shallow subduction may have been an increased rate of plate convergence .
Another proposed cause was subduction of thickened oceanic crust .
Magmatism associated with subduction occurred not near the plate edges ( as in the volcanic arc of the Andes , for example ) , but far to the east , called the Coast Range Arc .
Geologists call such a lack of volcanic activity near a subduction zone a magmatic gap .
This particular gap may have occurred because the subducted slab was in contact with relatively cool continental lithosphere , not hotter asthenosphere .
One result of shallow angle of subduction and the drag that it caused was a broad belt of mountains , some of which were the progenitors of the Rocky Mountains .
Part of the proto - Rocky Mountains would be later modified by extension to become the Basin and Range Province .
BASINS AND MOUNTAINS Section::::Basins and mountains .
The Laramide orogeny produced intermontane structural basins and adjacent mountain blocks by means of deformation .
This style of deformation is typical of continental plates adjacent to convergent margins of long duration that have not sustained continent / continent collisions .
This tectonic setting produces a pattern of compressive uplifts and basins , with most of the deformation confined to block edges .
Twelve kilometers of structural relief between basins and adjacent uplifts is not uncommon .
The basins contain several thousand meters of Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks that predate the Laramide orogeny .
As much as of Cretaceous and Cenozoic sediments filled these orogenically - defined basins .
Deformed Paleocene and Eocene deposits record continuing orogenic activity .
During the Laramide orogeny , basin floors and mountain summits were much closer to sea level than today .
After the seas retreated from the Rocky Mountain region , floodplains , swamps , and vast lakes developed in the basins .
Drainage systems imposed at that time persist today .
Since the Oligocene , episodic epeirogenic uplift gradually raised the entire region , including the Great Plains , to present elevations .
Most of the modern topography is the result of Pliocene and Pleistocene events , including additional uplift , glaciation of the high country , and denudation and dissection of older Cenozoic surfaces in the basin by fluvial processes .
In the United States , these distinctive intermontane basins occur principally in the central Rocky Mountains from Colorado and Utah ( Uinta Basin ) to Montana and are best developed in Wyoming , with the Big Horn , Powder River , and Wind River being the largest .
Topographically , the basin floors resemble the surface of the western Great Plains , except for vistas of surrounding mountains .
At most boundaries , Paleozoic through Paleogene units dip steeply into the basins off uplifted blocks cored by Precambrian rocks .
The eroded steeply dipping units form hogbacks and flatirons .
Many of the boundaries are thrust or reverse faults .
Although other boundaries appear to be monoclinal flexures , faulting is suspected at depth .
Most bounding faults show evidence of at least two episodes of Laramide ( Late Cretaceous and Eocene ) movement , suggesting both thrust and strike - slip types of displacement .
ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES Section::::Ecological consequences .
According to paleontologist Thomas M. Lehman , the Laramide orogeny triggered " the most dramatic event that affected Late Cretaceous dinosaur communities in North America prior to their extinction . "
This turnover event saw the replacement of specialized and highly ornamented centrosaurine and lambeosaurines by more basal upland dinosaurs in the south , while northern biomes became dominated by Triceratops with a greatly reduced hadrosaur community .
