SYNOPSIS
Section::::Synopsis .
Detective Inspector Mike Shepherd is sent from Auckland to Brokenwood to investigate a local police officer .
With a possible murder investigation underway that might link the two , Shepherd takes charge .
After the investigation Shepherd reassesses his life and decides to stay on indefinitely , even though it means a demotion to Detective Senior Sergeant .
Brokenwood is a seemingly quiet country town where Shepherd , who has an unconventional approach to police work , is assisted by local Detective Kristin Sims , who is precise and efficient at her job , to solve murders .
As the series progresses the working relationship between the two moves from rocky to functional as they begin to appreciate each other 's talents .
SETTING
Section::::Setting .
The fictional town of Brokenwood has a population of about 5000 , and is located some from the coast .
It is in a farming area , with crops ranging from wheat to viticulture , and the surrounding area is home to many people who have escaped city life ( from retirees to alternative lifestylers ) .
Though the exact location of Brokenwood is not stated , it was largely written and filmed in small towns immediately to the north of Auckland .
The real - life town of Warkworth doubles as Brokenwood , and the Brokenwood Police Station is a 1911 building that was the Helensville Post Office .
In " Sour Grapes " , Shepherd and Sims are seen travelling into Auckland across the Auckland Harbour Bridge , which would confirm that Brokenwood is also located to the north of the city .
In the same episode , it is mentioned that it takes two and a half hours by road to get from Brokenwood to Auckland .
This would put Brokenwood considerably further north .
A map shown in " Catch of the Day " locates Brokenwood close to the settlement of Langs Beach , at the southern end of Bream Bay .

Critical response to the series has been mixed , with many reviewers impressed by the plots but lamenting the occasionally hokey dialogue .
The two - hour length ( broadcast length with ads ) of episodes has also been mentioned by some as too long for such a series .
Writing in the New Zealand Herald , critic Colin Hogg panned the series , stating that it was " a local version aiming at that grand TV detective tradition " but that its " Dialogue is cliched , the acting aches and the locations are boring . "
International television website "
The Medium is Not Enough " was also generally negative in its review , describing the series as " genteel , New Zealand drama designed to appeal to perhaps an older demographic that likes comfortable murder - mysteries and to New Zealanders eager to watch anything that 's actually set in New Zealand and stars New Zealanders . "
Christine Tidball , writing for entertainment website Cheese on Toast was kinder , rating the series " charming , without being cloying , very well - written ( thanks to Tim Balme ) and funny , but not too funny [ ... ]
It 's also engaging , full of twists and will keep you guessing right till the end . "
As the series has progressed , reviews have become more positive .
DVD review website High Def Standard described the first series as " uniquely thrilling TV " and " a New Zealand Midsomer Murders that is n't afraid to venture off into Twin Peaks territory every now and again . "
The Manawatu Standard 's Malcolm Hopwood enjoyed the series but lamented episode length : " The Brokenwood Mysteries ( Prime Sundays ) is like our TPP negotiations .
They are long , energy - sapping but satisfying if you 're still awake after two hours . "
He added that the series was " intriguing , confusing and exhausting " , and that it " deserves our support but it needs to be recorded and watched in small chunks . "
Michael Reuben , writing for blu-ray.com , rated series one at 4 stars out of 5 .
The series has generally proved popular with the public , and has rated 7.0 out of 10 by reviewers on IMDb.com .
