N BATTERY
An N battery ( or N cell ) is a standard size of dry cell battery .
An N battery is cylindrical with electrical contacts on each end ; the positive end has a nub or bump on the top .
The battery has a length of 30.2 mm and a diameter of 12.0 mm , and is approximately three - fifths the length of a AA battery .
A zinc - carbon battery in this type is designated as R1 by IEC standards ; likewise , an alkaline battery in this type is designated as LR1 .
ANSI designates this battery as 910A and 910D for alkaline and zinc - carbon chemistries , respectively .
Energizer calls this type E90 .
Mercury batteries of the same dimensions are no longer manufactured because of their toxicity .
Former mercury cells such as the Mallory RM401 , Duracell RM-401 , IEC - MR1 , etc . were supplanted by the alkaline Kodak KN .
Rechargeable N - size batteries are also available , in nickel - cadmium ( KR1 ) and nickel - metal hydride ( HR1 ) chemistries .
However , these are far less common than other rechargeable sizes .
Rechargeable N - Series batteries may be charged in an AA charger using a makeshift adapter ( such as a small metal slug or a spring ) .
Some universal battery chargers ( with spring - loaded contacts ) are also able to charge N size batteries .
Common uses for this size of battery include some small flashlights , radio pocket pager receivers , remote control door chimes , glucose meters , small desk clocks , wireless microphones , laser pointers , some vintage calculators , some slot cars , and film cameras .
However , as technology has improved , many of these devices now run on button batteries .
An N - cell battery has a similar size to the A23 battery , which has a 12 V output .
