TOTAL COST
In economics and cost accounting , total cost ( TC ) describes the total economic cost of production and is made up of variable costs , which vary according to the quantity of a good produced and include inputs such as labour and raw materials , plus fixed costs , which are independent of the quantity of a good produced and include inputs ( capital ) that can not be varied in the short term , such as buildings and machinery .
Total cost in economics includes the total opportunity cost of each factor of production as part of its fixed or variable costs .
The rate at which total cost changes as the amount produced changes is called marginal cost .
This is also known as the marginal unit variable cost .
If one assumes that the unit variable cost is constant , as in cost - volume - profit analysis developed and used in cost accounting by the accountants , then total cost is linear in volume , and given by : total cost = fixed costs + unit variable cost
* amount .
The total cost of producing a specific level of output is the cost of all the factors of input used .
Conventionally , economists use models with two inputs : capital , K ; and labor , L. Capital is assumed to be the fixed input , meaning that the amount of capital used does not vary with the level of production .
The rental price per unit of capital is denoted r. Thus , the total fixed costs equal Kr .
Labor is the variable input , meaning that the amount of labor used varies with the level of output .
In fact , in the short run , the only way to vary output is by varying the amount of the variable input .
Labor is denoted L and the per unit cost , or wage rate , is denoted w , so the total variable costs is Lw .
Consequently , total cost is fixed costs ( FC ) plus variable cost ( VC ) , or TC =
FC + VC =
Kr+WL
Other economic models have the total variable cost curve ( and therefore total cost curve ) illustrate the concepts of increasing , and later diminishing , marginal returns .
In marketing , it is necessary to know how total costs divide between variable and fixed .
" This distinction is crucial in forecasting the earnings generated by various changes in unit sales and thus the financial impact of proposed marketing campaigns .
" In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers , 60%percent responded that they found the " variable and fixed costs " metric very useful .
CALCULATING COST
* Average Total Cost ( ATC ) =
Total Cost / Q ( Output is quantity produced or ' Q ' )
* Average Variable Cost ( AVC ) =
Total Variable Cost / Q * Average Fixed Cost ( AFC ) = ATC – AVC * Total Cost ( TC ) =
( AVC + AFC )
X Output ( Which is Q ) * Total Variable Cost ( TVC ) =
AVC X Output * Total Fixed Cost ( TFC ) = TC – TVC
* Marginal Cost ( MC ) = Change in Total Costs / Change in Output * Marginal Product ( MP ) =
Change in Total Product / Change in Variable Factor * Marginal Revenue ( MR ) =
Change in Total Revenue / Change in Q * Average Product ( AP ) =
TP / Variable Factor * Total Revenue ( TR ) =
Price X Quantity * Average Revenue ( AR )
=
TR / Output * Total Product ( TP ) =
AP X Variable Factor * Economic Profit
= TR – TC > 0
* A Loss = TR – TC < 0
* Break Even Point = AR = ATC * Profit Maximizing Condition =
