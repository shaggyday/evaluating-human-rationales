MY COUNTRY , ' TIS OF THEE
" My Country , ' Tis of Thee " , also known as " America " , is an American patriotic song , whose lyrics were written by Samuel Francis Smith .
The melody used is the same as that of the national anthem of the United Kingdom , " God Save the Queen " , arranged by Thomas Arne .
The song served as one of the de facto national anthems of the United States ( along with songs like " Hail , Columbia " ) before the adoption of " The Star - Spangled Banner " as the official U.S. national anthem in 1931 .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Samuel Francis Smith wrote the lyrics to " My Country ' Tis of Thee " in 1831 , while he was a student at the Andover Theological Seminary in Andover , Massachusetts .
His friend Lowell Mason had asked him to translate the lyrics in some German school songbooks or to write new lyrics .
A melody in Muzio Clementi 's Symphony No . 3 ( also called ' The Great National ' and contains the melody of ' God Save the Queen ' as a tribute to Clementi 's adopted country ) caught his attention .
Rather than translating the lyrics from German , Smith wrote his own American patriotic hymn to the melody , completing the lyrics in thirty minutes .
Smith gave Mason the lyrics he had written and the song was first performed in public on July 4 , 1831 , at a children 's Independence Day celebration at Park Street Church in Boston .
First publication of " America " was in 1832 .
