DRINKING IN PUBLIC Social customs and laws on drinking alcohol in public vary significantly around the world .
" Public " in this context refers to outdoor spaces such as roads , walkways or parks , or in a moving vehicle .
Drinking in bars , restaurants or stadiums , for example , is not generally considered to be " in public " even though those establishments are open to the general public .
In some countries , such as India and in larger regions , such as the Muslim world , public drinking is almost universally condemned or outlawed , while in other countries , such as Portugal , Spain , Germany , the United Kingdom , New Zealand , Japan and China , public drinking and public intoxication is socially acceptable , although may not be entirely legal .
CONTROVERSY Section::::Controversy .
Opponents of drinking in public ( such as religious organizations or governmental agencies ) argue that it encourages overconsumption of alcohol and binge drinking , rowdiness and violence , and propose that people should instead drink at private businesses such as public houses , bars or clubs , where a bartender may prevent overconsumption and where rowdiness can be better controlled by the fact that one is sitting down and security or bouncers may be present .
Alternatively , adults may drink at home .
Opponents of normalizing the public consumption of alcohol are also concerned about the risks associated with public inebriation such as broken bottles on the street and aggressive behavior while intoxicated .
Proponents of the right to drink in public argue that it does not itself cause problems and rather that it is social problems that cause over - consumption and violence , pointing to countries that allow drinking in public but have low levels of associated overconsumption and violence .
Proponents further argue that drinking in public helps normalize attitudes towards drinking and build a healthier drinking culture .

Separately , one may drink on aeroplanes and on most National Rail train services , either purchasing alcohol on - board or consuming one 's own .
In certain public places , it may be requested that people do not drink alcohol in that area .
It is not illegal to drink in these areas , contrary to popular misconception , but , in these areas , police may request the individual to stop drinking and potentially also surrender their alcohol , both open and closed containers .
It should be noted that Police Officers can only request that alcohol is surrendered if the drinkers are acting antisocially or they have good reason to believe they are going to do so .
These are formally known as Designated Public Places Orders ( DPPOs ) , and were allowed by The Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 ( CJPA ) ; they are more popularly known as ' Controlled Drinking Zones ' ( CDZs ) .
