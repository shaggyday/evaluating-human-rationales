SPIDER - MAN :
ONE MORE DAY Section::::Spider - Man : One More Day .
In an attempt to save Aunt May 's life , the 2007 storyline , erased the wedding from continuity by Mephisto .
Both participants are single again .
How the changes prevented the wedding was explained in the storyarc O.M.I.T. SPIDER - MAN : ONE MOMENT IN TIME Section::::Spider - Man : One Moment in Time .
In the first issue , Spider - Man stops Electro and his gang .
One of the gang members , Eddie , makes note of the arresting officer 's name .
Then Mephisto , as a red pigeon , swoops down and unlocks the door of the police car Eddie is in .
The officers are all occupied with cuffing Electro and Eddie escapes .
Spider - Man is out patrolling that night and hears the gunshots of Eddie shooting at the arresting officer and his wife .
While saving the cop and his wife , Spider - Man gets hit in the head with a cinder block .
He chases after Eddie and tackles him off the side of a building .
Spider - Man misses his web shot to save them because of the cinder block to the head , so he turns his body to absorb the impact and they both crash to the ground with Eddie on top of Spider - Man .
On the wedding morning , MJ shows up but Peter does not as he is lying unconscious in an alleyway .
When he wakes up and rushes to where the wedding was to take place , he finds Mary Jane there and the two decide to take what happened as an omen and simply live together .
At that point , the bulk of the Spider - Man stories from that point to the events of One More Day take place as they did normally , but with the two as a couple and living together while being unmarried .
However , Mary Jane makes it clear she does not want to be an unmarried mother , and thus Peter and MJ probably never conceive their child .
BACKGROUND Section::::Background .
Stan Lee , who co - created Spider - Man and was writing the Spider - Man newspaper strip at the time , recounted : Marvel 's promotion director Steve Saffel came up with the idea of having a famous fashion designer make the design for Mary Jane 's dress .
The newspaper strip version of the wedding was dedicated to designer Will Smith , who died shortly after designing Mary Jane 's wedding gown .

Peter now lives alone in a renovated apartment , attends college , and dates long - time best friend Mary Jane whenever she is available .
On January 3 , it was revealed that the current timeline of the rebooted strip is set " in the days before Peter and Mary Jane were married " .
