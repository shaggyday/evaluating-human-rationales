WELLS ( PRIORY ROAD )
RAILWAY STATION
Wells ( Priory Road ) was a railway station on the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway at Wells in the county of Somerset in England .
Opening on 15 March 1859 as Wells , on the Somerset Central Railway , at that time a broad - gauge line operated by the Bristol and Exeter Railway , prior to that Company 's amalgamation with the Dorset Central Railway to form the Somerset & Dorset , it was the terminus of the branch from Glastonbury .
The East Somerset Railway , an offshoot of the Great Western Railway - owned Wilts , Somerset and Weymouth Railway , extended its line to Wells in 1862 with its own station to the east of Priory Road .
Then in 1870 , the Bristol and Exeter Railway 's Cheddar Valley Railway from Yatton reached Wells with a third terminus station at Tucker Street to the north west of Priory Road .
Finally , in 1878 , with all three lines by this time converted to standard gauge , the GWR linked the Cheddar Valley line to the East Somerset line by running over a stretch of the Somerset and Dorset line , including through Priory Road station .
The East Somerset station closed on the commencement of through - running , but the through trains did not stop at Priory Road until 1934 and for 56 years passengers from , say , Glastonbury to Cheddar would need to change stations in Wells .
Priory Road adopted the full name in October 1883 , and the Cheddar Valley line station was renamed as Tucker Street in 1920 .
Priory Road station consisted of one platform with a station building and an overall roof .
The adjacent goods yard and junction with the GWR were controlled from a signal box .
The station closed to passengers on 29 October 1951 and the train shed roof was taken down soon after , although passenger traffic on the former GWR line through the station continued until 1963 , with goods traffic until 1969 .
