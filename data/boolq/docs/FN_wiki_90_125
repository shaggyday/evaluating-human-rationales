HISTORY Section::::History .
Marble Falls was founded in 1887 by Adam Rankin Johnson , a former Indian fighter and Confederate general , known as " Stovepipe " Johnson for his Civil War escapades , which included duping the Union army in Newburgh , Indiana , with fake " cannons , " constructed from stovepipes and wagon wheels .
Johnson had viewed the natural Marble Falls during his pre - war days as a Burnet County surveyor , and had dreamed of building an industrial city , powered by the tumbling Colorado River , not to be confused with the river of the same name in Colorado and Arizona .
Despite a " friendly fire " incident which blinded him near the end of the Civil War , General Johnson followed through with his dream , facilitating the construction of a railroad to nearby Granite Mountain in 1884 , then ( with ten partners , including one son , one nephew and two sons - in - law ) platting the townsite and selling lots , beginning July 12 , 1887 .
Johnson built a fine home , a college ( soon to be home of the " Falls on the Colorado Museum " ) and a large factory near the falls .
The town grew to a population of 1,800 within ten years .
Marble Falls made history in 1917 by electing Ophelia Crosby " Birdie " Harwood as the first woman mayor in Texas , three years before women were allowed to vote .
When the Max Starcke Dam was completed in 1951 , the marble falls which had given the town its name were submerged under the new Lake Marble Falls .
While the town 's economy struggled through the drought of the 1950s , a new economy based on tourism and retirement began to grow in the 1970s .
During the last thirty years , Marble Falls has grown into the retail and entertainment center for the Highland Lakes area , and continues to attract tourists , retirees and new businesses .
GEOGRAPHY

Marble Falls is located in southern Burnet County at ( 30.5741 , -98.2782 ) , on the banks of Lake Marble Falls .
According to the Handbook of Texas website , the former falls were flooded by the lake , which was created by a shelf of limestone running diagonally across the Colorado River from northeast to southwest .
The upper layer of limestone , brownish on the exterior but a deep blue inside , was so hard and cherty
it was mistaken for marble .
The falls were actually three distinct formations at the head of a canyon long , with a drop of some through the limestone strata .
The natural lake and waterfall were covered when the Colorado River was dammed with the completion of Max Starcke Dam in 1951 .
A photo of the falls as they once existed can be seen at the website for the Wallace Guest House , a local bed and breakfast .
