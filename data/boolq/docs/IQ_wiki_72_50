Cassie leaves towards the base with Evan , but learns that he is an Other , sent years ago as a sleeper agent and merged his consciousness into a human host .
The sleepers roam their designated zones , killing human survivors .
Evan admits his humanity was reactivated when he saw her , disagrees with the invasion and lets her leave .
He warns that Colonel Vosch and the military are possessed by the consciousness of individual Others .
At the base , the military have used deception and technology to convince the rescued children that the humans outside the base have been possessed .

CRITICAL RESPONSE
Section::::Critical response .
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 15 % based on 131 reviews and an average rating of 4.2/10 .
The site 's critical consensus reads , " With unimpressive effects and plot points seemingly pieced together from previous dystopian YA sci - fi films , The 5th Wave ends up feeling like more of a limp , derivative wriggle .
"
On Metacritic , the film has a score of 33 out of 100 based on 30 critics , indicating " generally unfavorable reviews " .
Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of " B – " on an A+ to F scale .
Jeffrey M. Anderson of The San Francisco Examiner said of the film , " Every plot turn and every line of dialogue has been borrowed from somewhere else , and everything is utterly , totally predictable " , noting how the film " steals material from ( but does not stop at ) the Twilight , Hunger Games and Divergent franchises . "
Anthony Lane of The New Yorker faulted the film as a " marketing wheeze dressed up as an art form , and stupendously summarized by the image of Cassie hurrying through the woods carrying both an assault rifle and a Teddy bear " , adding that the film " appears to have been designed by some crazed Oedipal wing of the N.R.A. " Rob Vaux of the Sci - Fi Movie Page gave the film one star out of five , saying , " The YA adaptation craze hits a low point with this aimless , purposeless alien invasion story that wastes a fine cast . "
In the San Francisco Chronicle , Mick LaSalle wrote , " rarely does a movie that fails so utterly start so well " , falling apart ahead of the fifth wave .
As to a possible trilogy , " if we 're not really vigilant , and look to the skies , and prepare , they 're going to make at least two more of these things .
We 've got to beat back the invasion now " .
Eddie Cockrell of Variety gave the film a mixed review , saying , " The 5th Wave is an effectively decent post - apocalyptic , young adult , world - in - the - balance survival thriller " with an " arrestingly original spin on trendy genre tropes " , although he suggested that fans of the book may have " issues with what has been edited " .
Brian Truitt of USA Today gave the film a positive review , stating that it " is an inviting sci - fi invasion " and " nicely stokes the imagination of a new generation of science - fiction movie nerds " .
He praised Moretz and Robinson as " equally strong " co - leads .
Shannon Harvey of The West Australian also gave the film a positive review , writing , " It 's actually got a lot going for it , from acting prodigy Chloe Grace Moretz as the kind of tough but fragile heroine you can cheer for to handsome production values , several plot twists " .
Michael Patterson of Moviepilot gave the film a positive review , calling it a " thrilling story of survival " .
