DEATH CERTIFICATE
The phrase death certificate can refer either to a document issued by a medical practitioner certifying the deceased state of a person or , popularly , to a document issued by a person such as a registrar of vital statistics that declares the date , location and cause of a person 's death as later entered in an official register of deaths .
NATURE OF A CERTIFICATE Section::::Nature of a certificate .
Each governmental jurisdiction prescribes the form of the document for use in its preview and the procedures necessary to legally produce it .
One purpose of the certificate is to review the cause of death to determine if foul - play occurred as it can rule out an accidental death or a murder going by the findings and ruling of the medical examiner .
It may also be required in order to arrange a burial or cremation to provide prima facie evidence of the fact of death , which can be used to prove a person 's will or to claim on a person 's life insurance .
Lastly , death certificates are used in public health to compile data on leading causes of death among other statistics ( See : Descriptive statistics )
Before issuing a death certificate , the authorities usually require a certificate from a physician or coroner to validate the cause of death and the identity of the deceased .
In cases where it is not completely clear that a person is dead ( usually because their body is being sustained by life support ) , a neurologist is often called in to verify brain death and to fill out the appropriate documentation .
The failure of a physician to immediately submit the required form to the government ( to trigger issuance of the death certificate ) is often both a crime and cause for loss of one 's license to practice .
This is because of past scandals in which dead people continued to receive public benefits or voted in elections .
Death certificates may also be issued pursuant to a court order or an executive order in the case of individuals who have been declared dead in absentia .
Missing persons and victims of mass disasters ( such as the sinking of the RMS Lusitania ) may be issued death certificates in one of these manners .
In some jurisdictions , a police officer or a paramedic may be allowed to sign a death certificate under specific circumstances .
This is usually when the cause of death seems obvious and no foul play is suspected , such as in extreme old age .
In such cases , an autopsy is rarely performed .
This varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction ; in some areas police officers may sign death certificates for victims of SIDS , but in others all deaths of individuals under 18 must be certified by a physician .
Accident deaths where there is no chance of survival ( decapitations , for instance ) may be certified by police or paramedics , but autopsies are still commonly performed if there is any chance that alcohol or other drugs played a role in the accident .
A full explanation of the cause of death includes four items : * the immediate cause of death , such as the heart stopping , * the intermediate causes , which triggered the immediate cause , such as a myocardial infarction , *
the underlying causes , which triggered the chain of events leading to death , such as atherosclerosis , and * any other diseases and disorders the person had at the time of death , even though they did not directly cause the death .
PUBLIC DOCUMENTS
Section::::Public documents .
In most of the United States , death certificates are considered public domain documents and can therefore be obtained for any individual regardless of the requester 's relationship to the deceased .
Other jurisdictions take a different view , and restrict the issue of certificates .
For example , in the State of New York , death certificates are only obtainable by close relatives , including the spouse , parent , child or sibling of the deceased , and other persons who have a documented lawful right or claim , documented medical need , or a New York State Court Order .
HISTORY Section::::History .
In Europe and North America , death records were kept by the local churches , along with baptism and marriage records .
In what would become the United States , the Massachusetts Bay Colony was the first to have the secular courts keep these records , in 1639 .
By the end of the 19th century , European countries were pursuing centralized systems for recording deaths .
In the United States , a standard model death certificate was developed around 1910 .
This promoted uniformity and consistency in record keeping .
SPECIFIC
JURISDICTIONS
UNITED STATES Section::::Specific jurisdictions .
Section::::United States .
In the United States , certificates issued to the general public for deaths after 1990 may in some states be redacted to erase the specific cause of death ( in cases where death was from natural causes ) to comply with HIV confidentiality rules .
In New York State , for instance , the cause of death on a general death certificate is only specified if death was accidental , homicide , suicide , or declared in absentia ; all other deaths are only referred to as natural .
All states have provisions , however , whereby immediate family members , law enforcement agencies , and governmental authorities ( such as occupational health and safety groups ) are able to obtain death certificates containing the full cause of death , even in cases of natural death .
In some cases , such as the death of a minor or infant , certificates may be kept confidential from the public as requested by legal guardian and therefore can not be obtained by the general public but rather through immediate family members .
UNITED KINGDOM Section::::United Kingdom .
Registration in the UK is organised separately in the constituent jurisdictions .
A register of deaths contains the information supplied by an informant , nowadays usually containing and repeating the information given in a Medical Certificate of Death ( MCOD ) supplied by the medical practitioner who certifies that life is extinct , this being the real " death certificate " distinct from the " registration of a death " in a register .
Further information might be added after the first registration if the death was the subject of an inquest ( Northern Ireland or England and Wales ) or a Fatal Accident Inquiry ( Scotland ) ; this can result in a later copy of a death registration giving more details of the cause of death or the associated circumstances .
ENGLAND AND WALES Section::::England and Wales .
In England and Wales , compulsory national registration of deaths began in 1837 .
Originally the death registration listed when and where a person died , their name and surname , the parent or parents ( if the deceased was a child ) , sex , age , occupation , cause of death , the description and residence of the informant , when the death was registered and the registrar 's signature .
Further details have since been recorded including the deceased 's date and place of birth , maiden surnames and other former surnames of women who have been divorced .
Beginning in 1879 , a doctor 's certificate was necessary for the issuance of a death certificate ( prior to that , no cause of death needed to be given ) .
NORTHERN IRELAND Section::::Northern Ireland .
The form of indexing and the layout of register pages generally follows that of England and Wales .
SCOTLAND
Section::::Scotland .
National registration began in 1855 ; registrations are rather more detailed than in England and Wales .
In the first year of registration many more details than in later years were recorded including the children of the deceased with their ages , the deceased 's birthplace and how long they were resident in the district where they died .
The burial place was recorded from 1855 to 1860 .
Standard details have until now included the deceased 's name , age , marital status , spouse(s ) ( if any ) , details of both parents , cause of death and the informant 's description .
Current ( 2011 ) registrations show the date of birth .
The prescribed forms are part of secondary legislation and those for recent years can thus be seen online in the Statute Law Database .
Unlike England and Wales , information is not limited to being supplied in the form of certified copies ; original register pages ( or filmed images ) can be viewed in person at local register offices or at the General Register Office in Edinburgh , online ( fees apply ) on the Scotlands People website or in microfilms
( 1855 - 1875 , 1881 , 1891 ) available at family history centres operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints .
UNITED KINGDOM 'S CROWN DEPENDENCIES AND BRITISH OVERSEAS TERRITORIES Section::::United Kingdom 's Crown dependencies and British Overseas Territories .
These jurisdictions do not form part of the United Kingdom and each has its own registration system .
Their older records tend to follow the layout used in England and Wales .
STILLBIRTHS
ENGLAND AND WALES Section::::Stillbirths . Section::::England and Wales .
Stillbirths ( beyond 24 weeks gestation ) have been registered since 1927 in a register that is closed from public access .
A single stillbirth registration takes the place of both birth and death registration for the stillborn infant .
Prior to 1960 such certificates gave no cause of death .
Stillbirth certificates can only be ordered by the mother or father of the deceased contacting the General Register Office by phone or letter .
In the event of the parents both having died , an adult sibling can order the certificate if they can provide the dates of death for both parents .
SCOTLAND
Section::::Scotland .
Registration of still - births commenced in 1939 .
The registers are not open to public view and extracts are only issued " in exceptional circumstances " .
UNITED STATES Section::::United States .
A 2007 article in People magazine revealed that in the case of a stillbirth it is not standard practice to issue both a birth certificate and a death certificate .
Most states instead issue a " certificate of birth resulting in stillbirth " .
