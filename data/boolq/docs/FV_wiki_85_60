GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW
Section::::Gameplay .
Section::::Overview .
World at War features more mature themes than previous Call of Duty installments and is open - ended , giving the player multiple ways to complete objectives , but otherwise generally plays like previous iterations of the franchise .
Players fight alongside AI - controlled teammates .
They help during the game 's missions by providing cover fire , shooting down enemies , and clearing rooms for entry .
When playing the Wii version of the game , instead of using a normal controller , such as the ones used by the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 , an optional gun - like expansion controller known as the Wii Zapper can be used .
The Zapper , or Wii Remote and Nunchuk , can be used to aim at targets to fire at them and simulate marksmanship .
The game 's return to World War II - era warfare reintroduces weapons and technology .
The player gains access to these over the course of the game , but may only carry up to two weapons in addition to hand grenades .
Weapons and ammo from fallen foes or friendlies can be picked up to replace weapons in a player 's arsenal .
Players can also find weapons with additional attachments , including guns equipped with rifle grenades , telescopic sights , and bayonets .
A character can be positioned in one of three stances : standing , crouching , or prone ; each affecting the character 's rate of movement , accuracy , and stealth .
Using cover helps the player avoid enemy fire or recover health after taking significant damage , as there are no armor or health powerups .
When the character has taken damage , the edges of the screen glow red and the character 's heartbeat increases .
If the character stays out of fire , the character can recover .
When the character is within the blast radius of a live grenade , a marker indicates the direction of the grenade , helping the player in deciding whether to flee or throw it back at the enemy .
The single - player campaign includes thirteen hidden " death cards " , denoted by playing cards attached to makeshift war graves .
There is one in each level ( barring those that take place in vehicles ) ; collecting them unlocks cheats for Co - op mode , such as reduced enemy endurance and " paintball mode " .
MULTIPLAYER Section::::Multiplayer .
World at War 's multiplayer experience resembles the one established in .
All versions of the game use a similar perk and ranking system and feature six multiplayer modes , including team deathmatch and capture the flag .
There are three " killstreak rewards " that can be used to turn the tide of battle : a recon plane , showing opposing players on the mini - map ; an artillery strike upon an area ; and attack dogs , which spawn and attack opposing players .
These are gained with 3 , 5 , and 7 kills , respectively .
They are available in all game modes , apart from team survival , and can not be edited .
The game also features a cooperative gameplay mode with up to two players via split screen on consoles , or four players online , for the first time in the franchise .
The Wii version of the game does not include online co - op , but two players can play through a " squadmate co - op " mode which allows both players to experience the game through the same screen and point of view .
NAZI ZOMBIES Section::::Nazi Zombies .
All versions except the Wii feature the minigame Nazi Zombies .
This is the first time Nazi Zombies ever appeared in any Call of Duty game .
The mode consists of 1 - 4 players fighting an unlimited number of waves of Nazi zombies .
Players can work together with other people to kill the zombies in a " co - op " ( cooperative ) mode either offline with two players or online with 2 - 4 players .
The players gain points by injuring or killing the zombies or repairing boarded - up windows , which are used to remove blockages inside the bunker and to gain access to more useful weapons than the starting M1911 pistol and unlock more rooms .
Zombies continually break the windows to gain entrance and to find and beat the players ; when all players are damaged enough to fall , the game is over .
Three extra maps for the Nazi Zombie game mode were added with the World at War map packs .
These maps , Shi No Numa , Verr√ºckt and Der Riese added on to the Nacht Der Untoten map which came with the game .

CHARACTERS
Section::::Synopsis .
Section::::Characters .
During the single - player campaign , the player controls three characters from a first - person perspective .
The player first assumes the role of Private C. Miller of the United States Marine Corps ' 1st Marine Division in the Pacific campaign .
He is captured by the Japanese , but is rescued by Corporal Roebuck ( voiced by Kiefer Sutherland ) and his men from the Marine Raiders squad , during the Makin Island raid .
Other notable non - playable characters of the Marine Raiders unit include Sergeant Tom Sullivan ( voiced by Chris Fries ) and Private Polonsky ( voiced by Aaron Stanford ) .
Private Dimitri Petrenko , the second playable character , fights on the Eastern Front with Sergeant Viktor Reznov ( voiced by Gary Oldman ) .
They are joined by a third character , Private Chernov , Reznov 's subordinate , who serves as a voice of reason throughout the campaign and regularly voices shock and disapproval at the brutal slaughter he witnesses .
They are all soldiers in the 3rd Shock Army under the command of Commissar Markhov .
The third playable character in the campaign is Petty Officer Locke , a weapons operator on a PBY Catalina flying boat , who is only playable in the mission " Black Cats " during a solo campaign .
PLOT Section::::Plot .
The story begins on Makin Island on August 17 , 1942 .
U.S. Marine Private C. Miller watches the torture and execution of his team , and is about to be executed himself before being rescued by another squad of Marines , led by Corporal Roebuck and Sergeant Tom Sullivan .
They assault the Japanese on the island , replicating the Makin Island raid .
The Battle of Peleliu is then replicated .
After breaking through the Japanese lines on the Peleliu beach , Miller destroys two Type 97 Chi - Ha tanks with rocket strikes , allowing the American tanks to advance .
At the end of the mission , Sullivan is killed by a Japanese officer with a katana .
Roebuck is promoted to Sergeant and he and his squad make their way through the Peleliu swamps to launch an assault on a Japanese - held airfield to disable anti - aircraft guns .
During the assault , Miller acquires a flamethrower to destroy a bunker and a bazooka to blow up
the Chi - Has positioned at the airfield .
Meanwhile , the Battle of Stalingrad is held on the Eastern Front on September 17 , 1942 .
Soviet Private Dimitri Petrenko regains consciousness in a blood - stained and body - filled fountain , just as German troops execute his comrades .
When they leave , Dimitri meets injured Sergeant Viktor Reznov , another survivor , who tells him of his mission to kill German general Heinrich Amsel , who is responsible for the massacres and crimes .
After killing German soldiers in their way and duelling an enemy sniper , Dimitri follows Reznov through buildings and streets and they meet up with the remainder of Dimitri 's unit , who are about to assault the General 's communication post .
During the assault , Dimitri provides overwatch with Reznov and aids the remaining Red Army soldiers as they recapture the post , managing to kill Amsel as he flees .
Dimitri and Reznov jump into the Volga River and escape .
The next mission takes place three years later , during the Battle of the Seelow Heights , near Berlin .
Dimitri has been captured by German soldiers in an abandoned house , but is saved when the Red Army attacks the house ; he is re - united with Reznov and introduced to his right - hand - man Pvt .
Chernov .
The Soviet troops advance through German lines and Dimitri aids them with a Panzerschreck until they reach and wipe out a German camp .
The story then shifts back to the Pacific Theater .
After pushing further inland on Peleliu , Miller and his unit take out enemy mortar crews so their tanks can go inland .
They then proceed through the Japanese underground tunnels to attack the artillery - filled Point , one of the major Japanese strongholds that had destroyed many landing boats when they first landed .
This allows American ships to advance , and Peleliu finally falls into American hands .
Back in Germany , Dimitri and Reznov pilot a T-34 tank , pushing through the last Nazi lines so the Soviet troops can board a train to Berlin .
Upon arrival , they engage German soldiers on the outskirts of Berlin , commencing the Battle of Berlin .
They then advance through the streets , eventually reaching the entrance of a Berlin U - Bahn station , where three German soldiers are attempting to surrender .
Reznov is unwilling to allow the men to live and gives Dimitri the choice of shooting them or burning them alive with molotov cocktails .
They head into the underground and start fighting German soldiers around the platforms , until a sudden surge of water fills the tunnel .
Dimitri , unable to avoid the oncoming tidal wave , almost drowns .
After America conquers Peleliu , the preparatory action for the Battle of Okinawa occurs in the Pacific Theater , during which Petty Officer Locke , in a PBY Catalina flying boat , takes part in a raid on three merchant ships .
On their way back to base , another Catalina , codenamed Hammerhead , is destroyed by Japanese Zeroes , leaving Locke and his crew alone .
Meanwhile , Task Force 58 of the US 5th Fleet is attacked , replicating Operation Ten - Go .
Locke 's PBY crew , the only one near enough to come to immediate aid , works to rescue as many American sailors as possible by fighting off Japanese PT boats and kamikaze planes .
With the PBY almost completely destroyed and ammunition on Locke 's .50 cal running out , all hope seems lost , until a sudden attack from a squadron of Vought F4U-1Cs drives off the remaining Zeroes .
In the following mission , Miller 's squad assaults a Japanese position on Okinawa , clearing out machine gun bunkers to allow American tanks to progress inland .
With the battle almost won , the Americans storm Shuri Castle amidst mortar shelling and constant banzai charges .
Once inside , they encounter Japanese soldiers surrendering .
However , when Sgt Roebuck and Pvt Polonsky search them , they reveal concealed grenades under their clothes , at which point Miller is presented with the choice of saving either Roebuck or Polonsky .
The remaining American troops arrive to assist the squad and engage the remaining Japanese soldiers in the castle 's interior garden .
After Miller calls in air strikes on two buildings , the Americans take Shuri Castle , crushing the last bastion of Japanese resistance on Okinawa .
Meanwhile back in Germany , Reznov drags Dimitri out of the U - Bahn to regroup with Soviet infantry .
The Red Army then advances towards the Reichstag .
During the assault at the Reichstag 's entrance , Chernov is severely burned by a flamethrower , and is implied to be killed .
Reznov , Dimitri and the remaining Soviet soldiers enter the Reichstag , clearing it of its German defenders , and reaching the rooftop .
After a final showdown on the top floor to reach the Nazi flag , Dimitri is shot by a dying German soldier , whom Reznov kills with a machete .
Although wounded , Dimitri manages to plant the Soviet flag , signalling Soviet victory and ending the war in Europe .
ZOMBIES CHARACTERS AND SETTING
Section::::Zombies .
Section::::Characters and setting .
The first map in the Nazi Zombies game mode , that came with the Call of Duty : World at War game is titled , " Nacht Der Untoten " ( German word translated to ' night of the undead ' ) .
The map is fairly simple compared to the ones from the map packs that came later in the DLC expansions for Call of Duty .
This zombie story takes place during World War II at an abandoned airfield in a bunker , with only two floor levels .
The four characters at this map are unknown United States Marines , it is not until the first map packs of Nazi Zombies that all four characters were given identities and they were not all the same .
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Development .
World at War was announced on June 23 , 2008 , by Activision , who confirmed that the game was to be released in fall 2008 , and that the series would revert to its customary World War II setting .
The game took about two years to make , twice as long as Treyarch 's previous entry to the series , Call of Duty 3 .
The game is powered by an improved version of the Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare engine , with several improvements made to the physics model .
Environments are more destructible and can be set on fire with the flamethrower , whose fire propagates .
Dismemberment , as well as realistic skin and clothes burning of the characters were added .
Not long after , Treyarch released the modding tools for Call of Duty : World at War .
These tools were the same ones used to create all the other Call of Duty series games , but with slight changes version to version , which can be downloaded online .
Kiefer Sutherland and Gary Oldman were cast as voice actors for the game .
Sutherland voices the narrator and squad leader of the American campaign , Sergeant Roebuck , while Oldman voices that of the Soviet campaign , Sergeant Reznov .
A full - sized replica PBY Catalina was constructed for motion capture use .
AUDIO Section::::Audio .
The music for Call of Duty : World at War was composed by Sean Murray .
He had worked with Brian Tuey , Treyarch 's audio director , on , the sequel to the first .
Murray said Tuey " knew I would bring a fresh approach to Call of Duty : World at War " .
Adam Levenson , the audio director of Activision , was called in to help them .
Murray said that he wanted to make the music more fun and intense , but also " a specific musical path that follows the psyche of the gameplay " .
The new technology of occlusion , which changes the sound made by nearby object depending on objects blocking its path e.g. walls , has been added to World at War .
The game has various levels of " muffled " sound depending on the objects it travels though e.g. a more muffled sound through a thick wall compared to a slightly muffled sound through a thin short wall .
For the first time in a Call of Duty game , the player is able to tell the difference between someone walking next to the player and someone walking above or below the player , as well as telling the difference between a shot fired in the distance and a shot fired close by , but behind a solid object .
The other technology of Flux was also developed using field recording systems .
The World at War crew traveled to a desert with mountains on both side of the range to test the frequencies of sounds made by World War II weapons .
Microphones were placed behind and 60 yards in front of the gun to test the echoes .
This was later replicated and developed in the studio for the game software .
It means that players will be able to pinpoint a sniper rifle shot , as it reflects off them , as well as hearing the initial ' pop ' of a hand grenade blowing up and then the grenade 's loud " whoosh " sound that begins where the grenade blew up , and ends behind the player .
The flux system also combines with the occlusion system .

Section::::Critical response .
Call of Duty :
World at War has received generally positive reviews .
Describing the game as a whole , GameSpot stated that by returning to the World War II setting , " World at War achieves greatness but falls short of excellence .
"
IGN concluded that World at War was a " solid , confident shooter with plenty to offer the casual and hardcore alike . "
Overall , the Official Xbox Magazine described the game as being more like an expansion pack in the Call of Duty series rather than a full game .
IGN applauded the developer Treyarch for its decision to stage World at War in the Pacific theater of World War II .
The addition of a co - op mode was also complimented as helping to increase the game 's replayability , and the multiplayer mode was described as " definitely an area where World at War shines .
" Some positive points noted by GameSpot include the " well - acted dialogue " of the characters Sgt .
Roebuck and Sgt .
Reznov , as well as the solid and fast - paced single player / co - op campaign . "
IGN criticized that the scope of the campaign hurt the continuity of the plot , with some missions taking place several years after others and disrupting the flow of the narrative .
Official Xbox Magazine 's main criticism was that Treyarch had not expanded upon the success of Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare , but had instead created a " play - it - safe sequel " that used elements of Call of Duty 4 but added " nothing noteworthy of its own . "
Other flaws pointed out by the reviewer included the lack of excitement in the campaign storyline and the few differences between the Pacific theater missions and European theater missions , stating " you could just be marching through another European town with a lot more trees . "
GameSpot criticized the game 's use of " well - worn source material " and " d√©j√† vu " game mechanics , also implying its similarity to the Call of Duty series ' other games .
1UP.com stated that the horror of the game is " almost too much at times " .
GameSpot praised the darker , grittier portrayal of the World War II settings .
1UP.com noted the significantly increased graphic violence and gore ( even over the M - rated Call of Duty 4 ) as a positive improvement in realism saying , " While enemies died en masse in previous installments , dismemberment and gore were essentially nonexistent .
That 's no longer the case ‚Äî here , legs are severed , men cry out in agony as they reach for lost body parts , and gouts of blood fly as bullets pierce flesh . " and that " World at War portrays the horror of WWII more accurately than ever before ... " SALES Section::::Sales .
