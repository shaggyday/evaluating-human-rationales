Despite its name , the dish and the terminology are North American , not British .
CUT Section::::Cut .
Although butchers may label top round steak or roast " London broil " , the term does not refer to a specific cut of meat but to a method of preparation and cookery .
PREPARATION Section::::Preparation .
The preparation of London broil typically involves marinating the meat for several hours followed by high heat searing in an oven broiler or outdoor grill .
It is then served in thin slices , cut across the grain .
If cut and used for sandwiches , the meat is usually rarer than traditional roast beef .
IN CANADA Section::::In Canada .
In parts of central Canada , a ground meat patty wrapped in flank or round steak is known as a London broil .
Some butchers will wrap the flank steak around a concoction of seasoned and ground or tenderized flank steak .
Others sell a pork sausage patty wrapped in flank or top round steak labelled as London broil .
Another variant , popular in Southern Ontario , is a London broil " loaf " , wherein the tenderized flank steak exterior is wrapped around minced and spiced veal as the filler .
In some regions , bacon will be added between the flank steak and the veal grind .
