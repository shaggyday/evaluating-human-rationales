PINE OIL Pine oil is an essential oil obtained by the steam distillation of stumps , needles , twigs and cones from a variety of species of pine , particularly Pinus sylvestris .
As of 1995 , synthetic pine oil was the " biggest single turpentine derivative .
" Synthetic pine oils accounted for 90 % of sales as of 2000 .
In alternative medicine , it is said to be used in aromatherapy , as a scent in bath oils or more commonly as a cleaning product , and as a lubricant in small and expensive clockwork instruments .
It may also be used varyingly as a disinfectant , sanitizer , mircobicide / microbistat , virucide , insecticide , and a massage oil .
It is also used as an effective herbicide where its action is to modify the waxy cuticle of plants , resulting in desiccation .
Pine oil is distinguished from other products from pine , such as turpentine , the low - boiling fraction from the distillation of pine sap , and rosin , the thick tar remaining after turpentine is distilled .
Chemically , pine oil consists mainly of Î± - terpineol and other cyclic terpene alcohols .
It may also contain terpene hydrocarbons , ethers , and esters .
The exact composition depends on various factors , such as the variety of pine from which it is produced and the parts of the tree used .

FROTH FLOTATION
Section::::Froth flotation .
Industrially , pine oil is used as a frother in mineral extraction from ores .
For example , in copper extraction pine oil is used to condition copper sulfide ores for froth flotation .
Therefore , it is important in the industry for the froth flotation process .
It has largely been replaced by synthetic alcohols and polyglycol ethers .
SAFETY Section::::Safety .
Pine oil has a relatively low human toxicity level , a low corrosion level and limited persistence ; however , it irritates the skin and mucous membranes and has been known to cause breathing problems .
