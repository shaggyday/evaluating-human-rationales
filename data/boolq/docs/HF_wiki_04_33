Francis E. Warren Air Force Base is a United States Air Force ( AFB ) base located approximately west of Cheyenne , Wyoming .
It is one of three strategic missile bases in the U.S.
It was named in honor of Francis E. Warren in 1930 .
Warren AFB is home of the 90th Missile Wing ( 90 MW ) , assigned to the Twentieth Air Force , Air Force Global Strike Command .
The 90 MW operates the LGM-30 G Minuteman III ICBM .
It is also the home of Twentieth Air Force , which commands all U.S. Air Force ICBMs .
Warren AFB is the oldest continuously active military installation within the Air Force , established in 1867 by the United States Army as Fort David Allen Russell .
The facility came under United States Army Air Forces control on 1 June 1947 , and United States Air Force ( USAF ) respectively on 18 September 1947 until now .
The 90th Missile Wing is commanded by Colonel Stacy J. Huser .
Twentieth Air Force , co - located at Warren AFB , has been under the command of Major General Fred B. Stoss since January 2018 .
Warren AFB is a census - designated place and had a resident population of 3,072 at the 2010 census .
OPERATIONS FACILITIES Section::::Operations facilities .
Unlike most Air Force Bases , Warren AFB has no runway for fixed - wing aircraft .
The only conventional airfield ever located at F. E. Warren AFB was a single dirt strip .
This field , never used by modern - day pilots , was made famous by World War I ace Captain Eddie Rickenbacker who crashed his plane on the field and survived .
The airfield was used in 1919 by the " Western Flying Circus " , led by then - Major Carl " Tooey " Spaatz .
The base maintains two active 100 ft × 100 ft helipads named north and south side , utilized by Air Force UH-1N Twin Huey helicopters of the 37th Helicopter Squadron to conduct tactical presence and response missions .
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION
Section::::Environmental contamination .
Due to extensive soil and groundwater contamination , the Warren AFB has been a superfund site listed on the National Priorities List ( NPL ) since 21 February 1990 .
Trichloroethylene ( TCE ) used to degrease equipment was found in groundwater in the West Cheyenne area from Belvoir Ranch to about 10 miles to the east of the site during the 1990s , as on numerous other military installations .
As of 2014 , the DOD has spent $ 15.8 million on the preliminary phase of the West Cheyenne Superfundsite over the past decade , installing monitoring wells , containing and passively treating water , and a feasibility study on installing " interceptor wells " .
A Restoration Advisory Board is established .
The extent of the underground TCE plume is unknown ; data analysis due to be completed 2015 will inform about its size .
The Army Corps of Engineers , who built the ICBM launch site in the 1950s , has been involved in investigation and clean up since 1989 ; the project manager for the Corps estimated in 2014 "
it will likely be a more than 100- or 200-year effort to actually remove the chemicals from the groundwater " .
Atlas missile site No . 3 was acquired in the late ' 70s and used as a car salvage yard .
It was not until 2001 when the Corps began investigating Cheyenne missile sites for TCE contamination , that a " 1.5-mile - long contamination plume at the site , [ was found ] and interest in the property evaporated .
The clean up is expected to cost $ 175 million .
"
In 2015 , the Corps stated that it wants to collect more data before recommending a remedy .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The history of the base dates back to the Railroad Act of 1862 , when president Lincoln and Congress set plans for the transcontinental railroad .
This included a military installation on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains in the Wyoming Territory , to protect Union Pacific workers from " hostile Indians " .
From these pioneer origins , the base evolved from a frontier infantry and cavalry post into the largest , most modern strategic missile facility in the U.S. Warren AFB is named in honor of Wyoming 's first United States Senator , Francis Emroy Warren ( 1844–1929 ) , who was awarded the Medal of Honor at age 19 during the American Civil War .
UNITED STATES ARMY FORT RUSSELL 1867–1927 Section::::United States Army .
Section::::Fort Russell 1867–1927 .
When President Lincoln and Congress set plans for the transcontinental railroad , they recognized the need for a military installation to protect Union Pacific workers from potentially hostile Indians .
On 4 July 1867 , the railroad established its mountain region headquarters at Crow Creek Crossing , later known as Cheyenne .
A few weeks later , the U.S. Cavalry moved from temporary headquarters in Cheyenne to a point west and established Fort D. A. Russell .
Thus , 1867 was the beginning of a city and a fort , and both have grown together over the years .
Detachments of the 30th Infantry formed the first garrison , under the command of Colonel John D. Stevenson .
For a brief time the troops lived in tents , but during the winter of 1867–68 they moved into wood - frame quarters .
The dwellings were set in the shape of a diamond , instead of a rectangle , to protect against harsh winter winds that howled across the then treeless high plains .
The diamond opened to the east and measured 800 by .
The entrance to the original fort was at a point next to the present day Chapel 1 .
The first troops stationed here lived the rough frontier life , which meant coping with the rigors of the weather in winter and " coping with Indians " in spring and summer .
In 1876 , troops from Fort Russell participated in the Great Sioux Indian Wars , the same in which Lieutenant Colonel Custer 's forces were defeated .
In 1884 , Fort Russell was made a permanent post , because of its strategic location .
In 1885 , the War Department ordered the post be rebuilt to serve eight infantry companies .
The Army built 27 red brick buildings for $ 100,000 to replace the older wood frame structures , and planted thousands of trees .
Many of the early brick buildings were stables that housed nearly 20,000 horses and mules .
From 1885 to 1930 , more than 220 brick buildings were erected ; most of them remain in use today .
The last expansion of the base took place in the early 20th century when large barracks along Randall Avenue were constructed .
The base maintains the historic exterior of each building with interior modifications for today 's living and working environment .
In 1866 , Congress formed four black regiments : the 9th and 10th Cavalry and 24th and 25th Infantry .
The 25th Infantry was the only unit that did n't serve at Fort D. A. Russell .
Black soldiers were called " Buffalo Soldiers , " a title originating from Native Americans who likened the soldiers to the spiritual buffalo .
In 1898 , the Spanish – American War renewed importance to the post .
Soon after President McKinley sent a message to Congress , the 8th Infantry left Fort D. A. Russell for Cuba .
Later that year , the Wyoming National Guard mustered into service at the post and departed for duty in the Philippines .
In the Battle of Manila ( 1898 ) , the Guard was the first battalion to reach the walls of the city and to raise the flag .
In 1901 , troops from Fort Russell returned to the Philippines to put down an insurrection for independence during the Philippine – American War laying ground for the occupation .
They returned with a Queen Mary Tudor cannon forged in 1557 and two of the three Balangiga bells , which had been used by insurrectionists as a signal to launch an ambush on American troops .
The bells were returned to the Philippines in 2018 .
The seven - foot cannon , the only one of its kind in America is on display near the base flagpole .
In 1906 , Secretary of War William Howard Taft recommended Fort Russell expand to a brigade - size post .
By 1910 , the construction of red brick quarters , two - story barracks , offices and stables had tripled the area of the post .
During this era , artillery units were assigned there , and the facility increased in size to accommodate troop training with the latest 20th century weapons .
From 1913 to 1916 , during the Mexican Revolution , post artillery units were stationed along the border to prevent the struggle from coming onto American soil .
During World War I , the post served as a mobilization point and training facility for field artillery and cavalry groups .
As World War I began , Fort Russell had become one of the largest military posts in the United States .
What stands as quarters No . 2 today was , in 1885 , the post commander 's home .
By tradition , the post commander always occupied the largest house on post .
Hence , the commander moved into quarters No . 8 when it was built in 1903 .
Quarters No . 2 was then assigned to the family of Captain John
" Black Jack " Pershing , who later led American forces in Europe during World War I. Pershing married U.S. Senator Francis E. Warren 's daughter , but she preferred staying with her father when her husband was on campaign .
Pershing would be promoted four ranks from his permanent rank of captain to brigadier general within two years of his marriage , the Senate 's approval of his nomination by President Theodore Roosevelt aided by his father - in - law 's influence .
FORT WARREN , 1930–1945 Section::::Fort Warren , 1930–1945 .
In 1927 , the last cavalry units left the installation , ending 60 years of cavalry history at Fort Russell .
President President Hoover issued a proclamation in 1930 which renamed the post " Fort Francis E. Warren , " to honor Wyoming 's territorial and first state governor .
Warren , who received the Medal of Honor for heroism during the Civil War at the age of 19 , was a U.S. Senator for 37 years , dying in office in November 1929 at the age of 85 .
Other well - known figures stationed here include General Billy Mitchell ( the " Father of the Air Force " ) , General Mark Clark ( World War II General in Europe ) , General Benjamin O. Davis , Sr . ( first black general ) , Dr. Walter Reed and singer Sammy Davis ,
Jr ..
Entertainer Chris LeDoux grew up at Warren AFB .
Former Wyoming Supreme Court Justice Richard V. Thomas was a JAG officer at the base from 1956–1959 .
During World War II , Fort Warren was the training center for up to 20,000 of the Quartermaster Corps .
More than 280 wooden buildings were constructed without insulation and interior walls to temporarily house the increased number of troops .
In the harsh Wyoming winter , waking up in these barracks often meant shaking snow from one 's blanket before heading for the just - as - cold communal showers .
A prisoner of war camp was also constructed at that time .
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE Section::::United States Air Force .
At the end of World War II , city officials in Spokane , Washington , had tried to acquire joint use of facilities at Geiger Field , Spokane which Air Training Command ( ATC ) had used as its Aviation Engineer Training Center .
The Army Air Forces were opposed to sharing facilities with civilian authorities , so its Headquarters directed ATC to transfer the training mission from Geiger Field to Fort Warren in Wyoming , and training stopped on 15 May 1947 .
AIR TRAINING COMMAND , 1947–1958 Section::::Air Training Command , 1947–1958 .
On 1 June 1947 Air Training Command assumed jurisdiction of Fort Warren , the 463d Air Force Base Unit was activated to manage the support facilities , and the 3450th Technical Training Wing was activated for conducting training .
Training began on 7 July 1947 .
In September 1947 , Fort Warren , along with other Army Air Force facilities , was transferred into the newly established United States Air Force .
In March 1949 , HQ ATC was directed to re - program , as a part of an overall restructuring to a 48-group Air Force .
The statement of trained personnel requirements gave priority to radio , radar , armament , and aircraft maintenance training programs .
ATC needed to find additional space for these courses .
Air Force announced on 17 January ( 1949 ? ) that all aviation engineering courses at Fort Warren , with the exception of " powerman " , would transfer to the Army 's Engineer School at Fort Belvoir , Virginia .
The " fixed wire courses " at Scott AFB went to Fort Warren , so that Scott had room to expand its radio mechanic school .
On 7 October 1949 , Fort Francis E. Warren became Francis E. Warren AFB .
As a result of the Korean War , Air Training Command had to process thousands of volunteer reservists ; between late July and the end of October 1950 , about 20,000 reservists were brought on active duty , most of which was done at Warren AFB .
In 1957 , in response to budget reductions , Air Training Command formed a base utilization board to examine all its facilities , looking at existing and future training requirements .
That board concluded that two bases could be released — Francis E. Warren and Scott AFB , Illinois .
Warren AFB had a number of strikes against it , including poor weather conditions limiting training to seven months of the year , lack of a flying field , and many inadequate buildings .
In 1958 , Air Training Command received permission from Headquarters USAF to phase out its training programs at Warren AFB .
Effective 1 February 1958 ,
the base transferred from Air Training Command to Strategic Air Command .
Training continued until 24 March 1959 , and on 1 May ATC discontinued its 3450th Technical Training Group .
STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND , 1958–2005 Section::::Strategic Air Command ,
1958–2005 .
The 389th Air Base Group was established on 1 February 1958 to take control of the former ATC facilities as part of the transfer to Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) .
The provisional 4320th Strategic Missile Wing was established that date with responsibility for 24 Atlas missile sites under SAC .
Although not the first designated missile wing , Warren became the first fully operational ICBM base in the Air Force .
706TH/389TH STRATEGIC MISSILE WING ATLAS D AND E MISSILES , 1958–1965 Section::::706th/389th Strategic Missile Wing Atlas D and E missiles , 1958–1965 .
The project design for the above - ground SM-65D Atlas ICBM launch and control facilities at " Site A " was to be completed by mid - May 1958 and construction finished in November 1959 .
Design revisions delayed the project several months .
Construction began at a location northwest of Cheyenne in late 1958 for the facilities of the recently activated 706th Strategic Missile Wing , which would control the ICBMs .
On 15 September 1959 , the first Atlas D missile to deploy away from Vandenberg AFB , California , went to the 564th Strategic Missile Squadron stationed at the Warren I complex .
A month later , Warren AFB became the recipient of the first air - transported Atlas missile .
In the presence of General Power , the Commander in Chief of SAC , the first Atlas D complex was turned over to the 564th SMS and declared operational on 9 August 1960 .
As work proceeded at the Warren I complex , the Army Corps of Engineers contracted for " Warren II " with three sites with three Atlas - D launchers at each in February 1959 .
The Warren II site was ready in the summer of 1960 .
The 565th Strategic Missile Squadron , activated on 1 December 1959 , operated the nine launchers .
The Warren III site , designed for nine SM-65E Atlas missiles would be scattered over a area at single " coffin " launch sites .
The term " coffin " was used because the missile laid on its side underground with the coffin roof at ground level .
This configuration offered limited protection for the launcher .
On 1 October 1960 , the 549th Strategic Missile Squadron became the last Atlas - E SMS to be activated .
The 549th SMS was re - designated 566th SMS on 1 July 1961 .
That same date the parent 706th Strategic Missile Wing stood down .
Command responsibilities at Warren AFB were assumed by the recently activated 389th Strategic Missile Wing .
In May 1964 , as the 565th and 565th SMS Atlas - D missiles were being phased out , the 389th Strategic Missile Wing received SAC 's last operational readiness inspection for this system .
In September 1964 , SAC inactivated the 564th SMS .
During March 1965 , the 566th SMS Atlas - E 's would also be deactivated , completing the phaseout of the Atlas Missile at Warren .
90TH MISSILE WING MINUTEMAN
I ,
1963–1974 Section::::90th Missile Wing Minuteman I , 1963–1974 .
The departure of the Atlas squadrons did not mark the end of F.E. Warren 's role in the ICBM program .
On 15 October 1962 , Morrison - Knudsen and Associates won the contract to construct 200 LGM-30A
Minuteman I missile silos over an area of Wyoming , Nebraska , and Colorado , located north and east of the base .
On 1 July 1963 , the Air Force activated the 90th Strategic Missile Wing .
Over the next year , four component strategic missile squadrons activated with the 400th SMS became the last Minuteman I " B " unit to stand up on 1 July 1964 .
In November 1972 , SAC initiated the " Minuteman Integrated Improvement Program " .
The program entailed silo hardening and upgrading command data buffers in the launcher control facilities , which allowed for quicker missile re - targeting and a new version of the Minuteman missiles .
After conversion to the LGM-30 G Minuteman III , the last Minuteman IB model went off alert status in September 1974 .
LGM-118
PEACEKEEPER MISSILES , 1982–2005 Section::::LGM-118 Peacekeeper missiles , 1982–2005 .
Minuteman III 's occupied the silos from 1974–1986 .
On 22 November 1982 , President Ronald Reagan stated his decision in a statement for Congress , to deploy the MX missile dubbed " Peacekeeper " ( later designated LGM-118 Peacekeeper ) to superhardened silos located at Warren AFB .
Capable of carrying up to 10 independently targeted nuclear warheads , the " Peacekeeper " was intended to strengthen the ground - based strategic policy of the U.S.
The initial plan was to deploy 100 " Peacekeepers " in silos of the 400th and 319th Strategic Missile Squadrons .
In July 1984 , construction began for " Peacekeeper " support facilities at Warren AFB .
From 1986 through 1988 , 50 " Peacekeepers " would be backfitted into the silos occupied by Minuteman III 's from 1974–1986 of the 400th Strategic Missile Squadron .
During that time contamination was documented to propose the base to be listed as a superfund site on 7/14/1989 .
In 2002 , President George W. Bush set a plan in motion to reduce the country 's missile forces from 6,000 to between 1,700 and 2,200 .
Russian president Vladimir Putin agreed to follow a similar plan , signing the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty .
As part of this reduction , the " Peacekeeper " missiles were taken off alert and inactivated beginning in 2002 until 16 September 2005 .
Squadrons were inactivated on 19 September 2005 .
TWENTIETH AIR FORCE , 1991–PRESENT Section::::Twentieth Air Force , 1991–present .
The end of the Cold War and combat during Operation Desert Storm in 1991 resulted in significant changes to the organizational structure of the U.S. Air Force .
On 1 September 1991 , Twentieth Air Force was reactivated by Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) and became responsible for all land - based Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles .
On 1 June 1992 , Warren transitioned from the inactivating SAC to newly established Air Combat Command , and on 1 July 1993 to the Air Force Space Command .
This realignment was designed to take advantage of the similarities between missile launch and space launch operations .
The 90th Strategic Missile Wing was also renamed the 90th Missile Wing .
The wing became the 90th Space Wing on 1 October 1997 .
With the ratification of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
I , the U.S. had until December 2001 to reduce its nuclear arsenal .
As a result , the 90th Missile Wing reduced the fleet from three ' reentry vehicles ' permissible to a single reentry vehicle configuration .
On 6 August 2001 , all 150 Minuteman IIIs had been converted to a single reentry vehicle .
Warren missile fields currently maintain 150 Minuteman III missiles , split evenly between the 319th , 320th , and 321st Missile Squadrons .
The 2005 Base Realignment and Closure commission ( BRAC ) did not recommend making any significant change to the base 's current operations .
On 1 July 2008 , the 90th Space Wing was re - designated the 90th Missile Wing , per the order of outgoing Air Force Chief of Staff General T. Michael Moseley as a way of refocusing the unit on the nuclear surety mission after the 2007 United States Air Force nuclear weapons incident .
The 90th Missile Wing was selected as the first missile base to upgrade Minuteman III launch control centers with the Rapid Execution And Combat Targeting modification .
Existing LCC 's had not been upgraded significantly since the early 1960s .
REACT replaced the command and control consoles with a single , integrated , computer - processing console .
Improvements in automation allow combat crews to more rapidly process message traffic and carry out execution orders .
On 1 December 2009 Twentieth Air Force was placed alongside all other U.S. ICBM and bombers with similar missions under a single command , the Air Force Global Strike Command , headquartered at Barksdale AFB , Louisiana .
On 23 October 2010 Pandemonium stirred when Warren losses communication status , for 1 hour , to 50 missiles sites due to a hardware issue , coinciding with a nearby UFO sighting .
CHALLENGE OF MAINTENANCE , UPGRADE Section::::Challenge of maintenance , upgrade .
Aging equipment such as analog phone lines or computer systems that still use floppy discs have become a subject of media attention ; Former missileers alerted the US television program 60 Minutes , which aired a segment about Warren AFB on 27 April 2014 .
The USAF plans to spend $ 19 million on improvements of Warren AFB missile silos and launch control centers in 2014 , and is asking for over $ 600 million in 2015 .
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated a cost of $ 355 billion to upgrade the triad of the U.S. nuclear weapons systems including ICBMs , submarines and bombers .
The base is recorded on the list of Superfund sites in Wyoming because of contaminated land on the site .

Due to the remoteness of the locations where they were constructed in the late 1950s and early 1960s , the Warren Atlas sites have not been redeveloped since their closure in 1965 .
The 564th SMS A / B Warren I site is completely abandoned .
The public road " Atlas Road " ends at a fence with a " No Trespassing " sign about 2 or from the actual site , and the road past the gate appears to be well cracked and vegetation is growing out of the unmaintained surface .
The site itself , which is in private ownership , when viewed from aerial images looks as if it has been abandoned for decades , The above ground launchers and support structures left as they were when inactivated nearly 50 years ago .
Roofs of some structures still exist , others do not .
The access roads are very deteriorated as well , with large areas of vegetation growing though the cracks in the surface .
The other Atlas - D sites for the 565th SMS are all intact ,
sites A and C appear to be unused although both are in private hands .
Site B has large numbers of abandoned vehicles on it , although again , all of the facilities appear to be still intact .
The Atlas - E sites appear to be intact , all in private hands , and other than being overgrown , appear to have been left to the elements and time since 1965 .

All appear to be intact and in government hands .
The locked gates and fences surround abandoned buildings which appear in good condition .
The 50 launch silos ( Launch Facilities ) have all been imploded , then graded .
Other than a road leading to the former site , most of which are still fenced and are still government owned , nothing more than natural vegetation is there in aerial imagery .
UNITS Section::::Units .
The 90th Missile Wing was activated 1 July 1963 , with the original designation as 90th Strategic Missile Wing .
It was the nation 's first operational Intercontinental Ballistic Missile base with the 1958 introduction of the SM-65D Atlas missile .
Today , the 90th MW operates 150 LGM-30 G Minuteman III ICBMs on full , constant alert .
The 90 MW is organized into five groups :
* 90th Operations Group * 90th Maintenance Group * 90th Mission Support Group * 90th Security Forces Group Other tenant units at Warren are : * 153rd Command and Control Squadron ( Wyoming Air National Guard )
* 30th Airlift Squadron
