COOKING APPLE
A cooking apple is an apple that is used primarily for cooking , as opposed to a dessert apple , which is eaten raw .
Cooking apples are generally larger , and can be tarter than dessert varieties .
Some varieties have a firm flesh that does not break down much when cooked .
Cooking apples are also known as culinary apples .
Culinary varieties with a high acid content become a froth when cooked , which is desirable for some recipes .
In Britain a large range of apples are grown specifically for cooking .
Worldwide , dual - purpose varieties ( those used for both cooking and eating raw ) are more widely grown .
Apples can be cooked down into sauce , apple butter or fruit preserves , baked in an oven and served with custard , and made into pies or apple crumble .
In the UK roast pork is commonly served with cold apple sauce made from boiled and mashed apples .
Bramley apple is by far the most popular cooking apple in the United Kingdom , while Granny Smith may be the most popular in the United States and Australia ( where it originated ) .
A baked apple is one that has been baked in an oven until it has become soft .
The core is usually removed and often the resulting cavity is stuffed with other fruits , brown sugar , raisins , or cinnamon , sometimes with a liquor such as brandy .
John Claudius Loudon wrote in 1842 : EATING RAW
Section::::Eating raw .
It is often believed that eating cooking apples raw will make a person sick .
In reality cooking apples are harmless raw and are just varieties of apples whose characteristics are well suited to cooking .
This myth is simply a product of cooking apples ' tart taste and the possibility of it not sitting well in the stomach .
