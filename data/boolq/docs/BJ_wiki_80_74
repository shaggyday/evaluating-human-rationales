CANADA DRY Canada Dry is a brand of soft drinks owned since 2008 by the American company Keurig Dr Pepper .
For over a century , Canada Dry has been known for its ginger ale , though the company also manufactures a number of other soft drinks and mixers .
Although Canada Dry originated in Canada , it is now produced in many countries around the globe , including the United States , Mexico , Colombia , Peru , Japan , & a number of countries of the Middle East & Europe .
The " Dry " in the brand 's name refers to not being sweet , as in a dry wine .
When John J. McLaughlin , who first formulated " Canada Dry Pale Ginger Ale " , originally made his new soft drink , it was far less sweet than other ginger ales then available ; as a result , he labelled it " dry " .
HISTORY Section::::History .
In 1890 , Canadian pharmacist and chemist John J. McLaughlin of Enniskillen , Ontario , who after working in a soda factory in Brooklyn , New York , opened a carbonated water plant in Toronto .
McLaughlin was the eldest son of Robert McLaughlin , founder of McLaughlin Carriage and McLaughlin Motor Car .
In 1904 , McLaughlin created " Canada Dry Pale Ginger Ale " .
Three years later , the drink was appointed to the Viceregal Household of the Governor General of Canada , and the label featuring a beaver atop a map of Canada was replaced with the present Crown and shield .
When McLaughlin began shipping his product to New York , it became so popular that he opened a plant in Manhattan shortly thereafter .
After McLaughlin 's death in 1914 , the company was run briefly by his brother , Samuel McLaughlin .
P. D. Saylor and Associates bought the business from the McLaughlin family in 1923 and formed Canada Dry Ginger Ale , Inc. , a public company .
Canada Dry 's popularity as a mixer began during Prohibition , when its flavor helped mask the taste of homemade liquor .
In the 1930s , Canada Dry expanded worldwide .
From the 1950s onward , the company introduced a larger number of products .
Norton Simon took an interest in the company in 1964 , and it merged with Simon 's other holdings , the McCall Corporation and Hunt Foods , to form
Norton Simon Inc. Dr Pepper bought Canada Dry from Norton Simon in 1982 .
In 1984 , Dr Pepper was acquired by Forstmann Little & Company , and Canada Dry was sold to R. J. Reynolds ' Del Monte Foods unit to pay off acquisition debt .
RJR Nabisco sold its soft drink business to Cadbury Schweppes in 1986 .
Today , Canada Dry is owned by Keurig Dr Pepper , which was spun off from Cadbury Schweppes in 2008 .
