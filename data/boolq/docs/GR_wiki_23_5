FERRET HEALTH
The domestic ferret is known to be affected by several distinct ferret health problems .
Among the most common are cancers affecting the adrenal glands , pancreas , and lymphatic system .
Viral diseases include canine distemper and influenza .
Certain health problems have also been linked to ferrets being neutered before sexual maturity was reached .
Certain colors of ferret may also carry a genetic defect known as Waardenburg syndrome .
Similar to domestic cats , ferrets may also be affected by hairballs , or dental problems .
ADRENAL DISEASE Section::::Adrenal disease .
Adrenal disease , a growth of the adrenal glands that can be either hyperplasia or cancer , is most often diagnosed by signs like unusual hair loss , increased aggression , constant grooming of owner or other ferrets as well as themselves , difficulty urinating ( caused by an enlarged prostate ) or defecating , or agitation when urinating , and ( in the case of females ) an enlarged vulva .
Signs of an enlarged prostate should be considered an emergency ; even if the growth is benign , it can still cause a hormonal imbalance which can have devastating effects on the ferret 's health .
Treatment options include surgery or cryosurgery to excise the affected glands , melatonin or deslorelin implants , which treat the symptoms but not the disease itself , and/or hormone therapy .
The causes of adrenal disease are as yet uncertain , but speculated triggers include unnatural light cycles , diets based around processed ferret foods , and prepubescent neutering .
It has also been suggested that there may be a hereditary component to adrenal disease .
Adrenal disease is usually detected during the spring or fall , as it affects the hormones that make the fur grow .
When affected ferrets shed their winter coat , the fur does not grow back .
The hair loss pattern is usually very specific for adrenal disease .
It begins at the base of the tail and then continues up the back .
Ferrets treated for adrenal disease may temporarily have severe hair loss as their bodies recover from the disease .
INSULINOMA Section::::Insulinoma .
Insulinoma , a type of cancer of the islet cells of the pancreas , is the most common form of cancer in ferrets .
It is most common in ferrets between the ages of 4 and 5 years but may also occur in younger ferrets .
The growth of cancerous nodules on the lobes of the pancreas sometimes , but not always , leads to an increase in the production of insulin , which regulates the rate at which the ferret 's body metabolizes blood glucose .
Too much insulin causes blood sugar to drop , resulting in lethargy , seizures , and ultimately death .
Symptoms of an insulinoma attack include episodes of lethargy , drooling , pawing or foaming at the mouth , high pitched screams , staring " blankly " into space , and seizures .
The exact cause of insulinoma is unknown .
It is speculated that the diets of domestic ferrets are too far removed from the natural diets of their polecat ancestors , and include too much sugar or simple carbohydrates .
Treatment for insulinoma may include surgical excision of the cancerous lobes , pharmaceutical treatment with steroids that suppress the production of insulin , supplemental changes in diet ( most often poultry - based baby food ) , or a combination thereof .
Unfortunately , the growth of the tumors can not always be completely stopped , and the ferret will sometimes have a recurrence of symptoms .
In an insulinoma attack , a temporary remedy to stabilize the ferret is any kind of a sugary syrup , such as corn syrup or honey .
LYMPHOMA Section::::Lymphoma .
Lymphoma / lymphosarcoma is the most common malignancy in ferrets .
Ferret lymphosarcoma occurs in two forms --
juvenile lymphosarcoma , a fast - growing type that affects ferrets younger than two years , and adult lymphosarcoma , a slower - growing form that affects ferrets four to seven years old .
In juvenile ferret lymphosarcoma , large , immature lymphocytes ( lymphoblasts ) rapidly invade the thymus or the organs of the abdominal cavity , particularly the liver and spleen .
In adult ferret lymphosarcoma , the lymph nodes in the limbs and abdominal cavity become swollen early on due to invasion by small , mature lymphocytes .
Invasion of organs , such as the liver , kidney , lungs , and spleen , occurs later on , and the disease may be far advanced before symptoms are noticeable .
As in humans , ferret lymphosarcoma can be treated surgically , with radiation therapy , chemotherapy or a combination thereof .
The long - term prognosis is rarely bright , however , and this treatment is intended to improve quality of life with the disease .
VIRAL DISEASES
EPIZOOTIC CATARRHAL ENTERITIS
Section::::Viral diseases .
Section::::Epizootic catarrhal enteritis .
Epizootic catarrhal enteritis ( ECE ) is a viral disease that first appeared in the northeastern US in 1994 , is an inflammation of the mucous membranes in the intestine .
The condition manifests itself as severe diarrhea ( often of a bright green color ) , loss of appetite , and severe weight loss .
The virus can be passed via fluids and indirectly between humans .
Although it was often fatal when first discovered , ECE is less of a threat today .
FERRET SYSTEMIC CORONAVIRUS ( FSC )
Section::::Ferret systemic coronavirus ( FSC ) .
The coronavirus which causes ECE has a counterpart strain that has more systemic effects with a higher mortality rate .
This systemic syndrome has been compared to Feline infectious peritonitis in cats .
ALEUTIAN DISEASE VIRUS Section::::Aleutian disease virus .
Aleutian disease virus ( ADV ) is a parvovirus discovered among mink in the Aleutian Islands in the early 20th century .
In ferrets , the virus affects the immune system ( causing it to produce non - neutralizing antibodies ) and many internal organs , particularly the kidneys .
There is no cure or vaccine for the disease , and ferrets may carry the virus for months or years without any signs .
CANINE DISTEMPER Section::::Canine distemper .
Canine distemper ( CD ) is an extremely contagious virus that is considered always fatal .
Being strict indoor pets does not necessarily protect ferrets , as owners may bring the virus home on their clothes or their shoes .
The distemper virus is very short - lived in hot , dry weather , but may persist on hands or surfaces for much longer in cool , damp weather .
The only protection against the virus is vaccination , but that is not without controversy as there have been reports , particularly from the US , of ferrets going into anaphylactic shock after being vaccinated against CD .
There is some anecdotal evidence that occurrence of a vaccine reaction is related to a low blood sugar level , and that feeding the ferret a sweet paste - type nutritional supplement shortly before the vaccination to raise the blood glucose has reduced the incidence of reactions .
A ferret with partial immunity to distemper can be exposed to canine distemper and go through an incubation period of up to six weeks before showing signs of infection , as compared to a few days in an unvaccinated animal .
Signs can include runny nose , discharge from the eyes , fever , up to , and severe malaise , followed by development of changes in the skin including discoloration and thickening of the nose ( a pink nose will develop an orange coloration ) , measles - like sores on the chin and belly , and thick crusting of the pads of the feet ( hyperkeratosis ) .
The discharge is highly contagious to other unvaccinated ferrets and canines .
If the ferret survives the initial acute phase of the disease , they will die within a few weeks from a progressive and incurable neurological infection , progressing to severe epileptic seizures and death .
INFLUENZA Section::::Influenza .
Influenza , essentially the same disease and same agent that occur in humans , is caused by an othomyxovirus that can be passed from ferrets to humans and from humans to ferrets .
Ferrets have served as experimental animal models in the study of influenza virus .
Smith , Andrews , Laidlaw ( 1933 ) inoculated ferrets intra - nasally with human naso - pharyngeal washes , which produced a form of influenza that spread to other cage mates .
The human influenza virus ( Influenza type A ) was transmitted from an infected ferret to a junior investigator , from whom it was subsequently re - isolated .
The virus usually affects the nasal epithelium but can cause pneumonia .
Signs include anorexia , fever , sneezing , nasal and ocular discharges and usually spontaneous recovery in 4 days or less .
Antibiotic use can prevent complicating secondary bacterial infections .
FOOT ROT Section::::Foot rot .
A common ailment which can be fatal in ferrets is foot rot , a form of fungal infection which attacks the feet and sometimes spreads to the tail .
It initially appears as a small , yellow , scab - like infection .
If untreated , it can cover the feet , and later the entire body .
Foot rot is normally caused by poor cage hygiene , i.e. , excessive feces accumulation .
NEUTERING
Section::::Neutering .
Like many other carnivores , ferrets have scent glands near their anuses , the secretions from which are used in scent marking .
Ferrets recognize other individuals from these anal gland secretions , as well as the sex of unfamiliar individuals .
Ferrets may also use urine marking for sex and individual recognitions .
Males , if not neutered , are extremely musky .
It is considered preferable to delay neutering until sexual maturity has been reached , at approximately six to eight months old , after the full descent of the testicles .
Neutering the male will reduce the smell to almost nothing .
The same applies for females , but spaying them is also important for their own health .
Unless they are going to be used for breeding purposes , female ferrets will go into extended heat .
A female that does not mate can die of aplastic anemia without medical intervention .
It is possible to use a vasectomised male to take a female out of heat .
Due to speculation on the possible effects of the photoperiod effect on the ferret 's adrenal gland , some owners prefer to house their pets outdoors in sheds , and not indoors .
Male ferrets may be chemically castrated using a deslorelin implant , which lasts for at least a year .
Males with a deslorelin implant are less aggressive to other males compared to males castrated surgically .
CONGENITAL SENSORINEURAL DEAFNESS Section::::Congenital sensorineural deafness .
A high proportion of ferrets with white markings which form coat patterns known as a blaze , badger , or panda coat , such as a stripe extending from their face down the back of their head to their shoulder blades , or a fully white head , have a congenital deafness ( partial or total ) which is similar to Waardenburg syndrome in humans .
Ferrets without white markings , but with premature graying of the coat , are also more likely to have some deafness than ferrets with solid coat colors which do not show this trait .
Most albino ferrets are not deaf ; if deafness does occur in an albino ferret , this may be due to an underlying white coat pattern which is obscured by the albinism .
In humans , Waardenburg syndrome leads to higher instances of reproductive disorders and a reduced life expectancy ; these phenomena have been reported by some ferret owners , but , there is no scientific evidence correlating these findings with congenital sensorineural deafness .
Except for albinism , the genetics of coat color in ferrets is not known , and the genes that cause deafness have not been identified .
Owners may not easily identify deafness in their ferret ; affected ferrets may have behavioral or training problems , or may have greater than usual social conflict with other ferrets .
A ferret 's hearing can be tested by a brainstem auditory evoked response test , with the ferret under general anesthesia .
HAIRBALLS Section::::Hairballs .
Hairballs can occur in ferrets , but are not readily expelled by vomiting like the way cats deal with them .
One or more hairballs in a ferret may lead to loss of appetite and subsequent weight loss .
A hairball may enter the intestine and cause a life - threatening obstruction .
Ferrets typically replace their coats twice a year , and at that time require brushing to remove loose hairs before they can be ingested , and possibly administration of a hairball remedy as a preventive .
Artificial lighting or administration of certain medications may alter the normal spring and fall seasonal coat changes in the ferret .
TARTAR AND DENTAL ABRASION Section::::Tartar and dental
abrasion .
Dental calculus ( tartar ) is a hard substance formed on the teeth from the mineralization of plaque .
Dental tartar primarily comes from wet food which gets stuck to the teeth for extended periods of time .
Tartar can be avoided by ferrets eating raw meat , bones and preferably whole prey .
The biomechanics of consuming meat and bones will keep the teeth clean .
Left to itself , tartar may lead to gingivitis which in turn can lead to a dental abscess , bone loss , infections which may spread bacteria through the bloodstream to internal organs and lead to death if not treated .
Tartar can be removed either mechanical or by ultrasound at a veterinarian ( this usually involves anesthesia ) , a small toothbrush can also be used as a preventive measure if one is unable to feed the animal with raw meat .
Tartar can be prevented by feeding raw food or giving specially made gelatin treats for ferrets .
Dental abrasion or tooth wear is common in ferrets , and is caused by mechanical wear of the teeth .
Eating manufactured dry food ( kibble ) will erode ( due to the hard and extremely dry kibble )
the carnassial teeth of the ferret , the wear from the eating kibble can become significant with old age ( after three to five years ) .
If teeth are overly ground down , a ferret can not use them as scissors to eat raw meat .
Tooth erosion eventually affects a ferret 's ability to eat solid food .
Dental abrasion can also be caused by excessive chewing on fabrics or toys , and cage biting .
If the ferret engages in these activities a lot , it might be a sign of boredom , and more stimulating activities ( such as play ) should rectify the situation .
