CLIMAX ( NARRATIVE )
The climax ( from the Greek word κλῖμαξ , meaning " staircase " and " ladder " ) or turning point of a narrative work is its point of highest tension and drama , or it is the time when the action starts during which the solution is given .
The climax of a story is a literary element .
EXAMPLES Section::::Examples .
The punch line of a joke is an analogy for the climax of a fictional narrative , though the absence of any falling action is an essential difference , which may reflect the nature of humor as opposed to the nature of drama .
In non - fictional narrative genres , even though the author does not have the same freedom to control the action and " plot " as in works of fiction , the selection of subject matter , degree of detail , and emphasis permit an author to create similar structures , i.e. , to construct a dramatization .
In the play Hippolytus , by the famous Greek playwright , Euripides , the climax arrives when Phaedra hears Hippolytus react badly because of her love for him .
That is the moment that Aphrodite 's curse is finally fulfilled , and it is the turning point of the play .
ANTICLIMAX Section::::Anticlimax .
An anticlimax is a situation in a plot in which something which would appear to be difficult to solve is solved through something trivial .
For example , destroying a heavily guarded facility would require advanced technology , teamwork , and weaponry for a climax , but for an anticlimax , it may just require pushing a red button which reads , " Emergency Self - Destruct " , or simply filling out an eviction notice and destroying the building .
A famous example is the ending of The War of the Worlds , where amidst the chaos of the extraterrestrial takeover of planet Earth , the aliens are defeated by the most unexpected organism : the common cold virus .
Another example could involve the protagonist faced with insurmountable odds and ultimately being killed without accomplishing his goal , despite what appears to be a turning point for the character .
