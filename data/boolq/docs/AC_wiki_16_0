INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS INSTRUMENTS
International human rights instruments are treaties and other international documents relevant to international human rights law and the protection of human rights in general .
They can be classified into two categories : declarations , adopted by bodies such as the United Nations General Assembly , which are not legally binding although they may be politically so as soft law ; and conventions , which are legally binding instruments concluded under international law .
International treaties and even declarations can , over time , obtain the status of customary international law .
International human rights instruments can be divided further into global instruments , to which any state in the world can be a party , and regional instruments , which are restricted to states in a particular region of the world .
Most conventions establish mechanisms to oversee their implementation .
In some cases these mechanisms have relatively little power , and are often ignored by member states ; in other cases these mechanisms have great political and legal authority , and their decisions are almost always implemented .
Examples of the first case include the UN treaty committees , while the best exemplar of the second case is the European Court of Human Rights .
Mechanisms also vary as to the degree of individual access to them .
Under some conventions – e.g. the European Convention on Human Rights – individuals or states are permitted , subject to certain conditions , to take individual cases to the enforcement mechanisms ; under most , however ( e.g. the UN conventions ) , individual access is contingent on the acceptance of that right by the relevant state party , either by a declaration at the time of ratification or accession , or through ratification of or accession to an optional protocol to the convention .
This is part of the evolution of international law over the last several decades .
It has moved from a body of laws governing states to recognizing the importance of individuals and their rights within the international legal framework .
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights are sometimes referred to as the international bill of rights .
