NORTHWEST FLORIDA
STATE COLLEGE Northwest Florida State College is a state college in Niceville , Florida and part of the Florida College System .
NWFSC was founded in 1963 as Okaloosa - Walton Junior College , with its campus in Valparaiso , Florida ; students started class the next year .
A permanent campus in Niceville was built and started serving students with the 1969â€“70 academic year .
The school voted to change its name to Okaloosa - Walton Community College in 1988 , and gained four - year status in 2003 , thus changing its name to Okaloosa - Walton College .
In June 2008 , Florida Governor Charlie Crist signed a bill that allowed several community colleges , including OWC , to offer four - year degrees and be considered part of Florida 's upper education under the newly formed Florida College Pilot Project making OWC one of the state colleges in Florida .
Due to the change , school officials elected to once again change the name this time to Northwest Florida State College .
NWFSC also has a charter high school called the Collegiate High School at Northwest Florida State College , which opened in 2000 .
