SHAKEN , NOT STIRRED
" Shaken , not stirred " is a catchphrase of Ian Fleming 's fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond and describes his preference for the preparation of his martini cocktails .
The phrase first appears in the novel Diamonds Are Forever ( 1956 ) , though Bond himself does not actually say it until Dr. No ( 1958 ) , where his exact words are " shaken and not stirred . "
In the film adaptations of Fleming 's novels , the phrase is first uttered by the villain , Dr. Julius No , when he offers the drink in Dr. No ( 1962 ) , and it is not uttered by Bond himself ( played by Sean Connery ) until Goldfinger ( 1964 ) .
It is used in numerous Bond films thereafter with the notable exceptions of You
Only Live Twice ( 1967 ) , in which the drink is wrongly offered as " stirred , not shaken " , to Bond 's response " that 's right " , and Casino Royale ( 2006 ) in which Bond , after losing millions of dollars in a game of poker , is asked if he wants his martini shaken or stirred and snaps , " Do I look like I give a damn ? "
VARIATIONS IN THE BOND NOVELS AND FILMS
NOVELS Section::::Variations in the Bond novels and films .
Section::::Novels .
The earliest form of the " shaken , not stirred " motif appears in the first Bond novel , Casino Royale ( 1953 ) .
After meeting his CIA contact Felix Leiter for the first time , Bond orders a drink from a barman while at the casino .
The drink will later be referred to as a " Vesper " , after the original Bond girl , Vesper Lynd .
A Vesper differs from Bond 's usual cocktail of choice , the martini , in that it uses both gin and vodka , Kina Lillet instead of vermouth , and lemon peel instead of an olive .
In the same scene Bond gives more details about the Vesper , telling the same barman that vodka made from grain instead of potatoes makes the drink even better .
Kina Lillet is no longer available , but can be approximated by using the sweeter Lillet Blanc along with a dash of Angostura Bitters .
Another Kina ( or quinine )
apertif which has the bite and approximate flavour is Cocchi Americano .
Russian and Polish vodkas were also always preferred by Bond if they were in stock .
Although there is a lot of discussion on the Vesper , it is only ordered once throughout Fleming 's novels and by later books
Bond is ordering regular vodka martinis , though he also drinks regular gin martinis .
In total , Bond orders 19 vodka martinis and 16 gin martinis throughout Fleming 's novels and short stories .
FILM Section::::Film .
The American Film Institute honoured Goldfinger and the phrase on 21 July 2005 by ranking it # 90 on a list of best movie quotes in the past 100 years of film .
SEAN CONNERY Section::::Sean Connery .
The shaken Martini is mentioned twice in the first Bond film
Dr. No ( 1962 ) .
When Bond has presumably ordered a drink from room service to his hotel room , it is mixed by a waiter , who says " one medium dry vodka martini mixed like you said , sir , but not stirred . "
( A slice of lime was in the bottom of the glass . )
Later , Dr. No presents Bond with a drink – " A medium dry martini , lemon peel .
Shaken , not stirred . "
Bond did not vocally order one himself until Goldfinger ( 1964 ) .
In the 1967 film You Only Live Twice , Bond 's contact Henderson prepares a martini for Bond and says , " That 's , um , stirred not shaken .
That was right , was n't it ? "
To which Bond replies politely , " Perfect . "
GEORGE LAZENBY Section::::George Lazenby .
In George Lazenby 's only film as Bond , On Her Majesty 's Secret Service , Bond never actually orders himself a drink , but when he meets Marc - Ange Draco for the first time , Draco tells his assistant , Olympe , to get a dry martini for Bond .
Draco then adds , " Shaken , not stirred . "
ROGER MOORE Section::::Roger Moore .
Roger Moore 's Bond never actually ordered one himself , but has one ordered for him several times , nonetheless .
In the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me , Anya Amasova orders him one .
In Moonraker , his drink is prepared by Manuela .
In Octopussy , the title character ( Maud Adams ) herself greets Bond by mixing his drink .
TIMOTHY DALTON Section::::Timothy Dalton .
Timothy Dalton 's Bond ordered his trademark Martini in each of his films .
In The Living Daylights he and Kara arrive in Austria where he orders a martini " Shaken , not stirred " shortly after entering their hotel .
For his second film , Licence to Kill he does n't directly order it .
Instead , he tells Pam Bouvier what drink he 'd like as he plays Blackjack , only to end up disappearing shortly after , leaving Bouvier to down the entire martini in one long gulp .
PIERCE BROSNAN Section::::Pierce Brosnan .
In GoldenEye , Bond orders the drink in a casino while talking with Xenia Onatopp , and later , Zukovsky refers to Bond as a " charming , sophisticated secret agent .
Shaken , but not stirred . "
In Tomorrow Never Dies , Paris Carver orders the drink for Bond after the two meet again after years apart .
While Paris ' choice of drink had changed , Bond 's had not .
In The World Is Not Enough , Bond orders the drink in Zukovsky 's casino .
In Die Another Day , Bond is coming back on a rather turbulent British Airways flight .
The air hostess ( played by Roger Moore 's daughter Deborah ) serves him his martini , to which Bond replies , " Luckily I asked for it shaken . " .
Later in the film , when Bond travels to Gustav Graves ' ice palace in Iceland , he orders another martini , sarcastically telling the bartender " Plenty of ice , if you can spare it . "
DANIEL CRAIG Section::::Daniel Craig .
The Vesper was reused in the 2006 film version of Casino Royale , while Bond is playing poker to defeat Le Chiffre .
Daniel Craig 's Bond ordered the drink , providing great detail about how it should be prepared .
The other poker players order the Vesper as well , with Felix Leiter telling the bartender to " Keep the fruit " with his .
Later , after Bond loses money to Le Chiffre , he orders another martini , but when the barman asks whether he would like it shaken or stirred , Bond snaps , " Do I look like I give a damn ? "
In Quantum of Solace , the bartender on an aeroplane gives the precise recipe for the Vesper from Fleming 's novel Casino Royale , which was a minor anachronism since Kina Lillet was reformulated ( removing the Kina ) in 1986 , 22 years before the film 's production .
Bond is purported to have drunk six of them .
In Skyfall , when talking to Bond girl Sévérine at a casino bar , the bartender is seen shaking Bond 's martini before pouring it , to which Bond comments " perfect " .
In Spectre , Bond orders his signature drink in a mountaintop resort , only to be told to his disdain that he is at a health clinic and that the bar does not serve alcohol .
Q instead orders Bond an unpleasant - looking green - coloured ' prolytic digestive enzyme shake ' , and a disgusted Bond asks the barman " Do me a favor , will you ?
Throw that down the toilet .
Cut out the middleman . "
PURPOSE OF SHAKING Section::::Purpose of shaking .
Scientists , specifically biochemists , and martini connoisseurs have investigated the difference between a martini shaken and a martini stirred .
The Department of Biochemistry at the University of Western Ontario in Canada conducted a study to determine if the preparation of a martini has an influence on their antioxidant capacity ; the study found that the shaken gin martinis were able to break down hydrogen peroxide and leave only 0.072 % of the peroxide behind , versus the stirred gin martini , which left behind 0.157 % of the peroxide .
Thus a shaken martini has more antioxidants than a stirred one .
The study was done at the time because moderate consumption of alcohol appears to reduce the risk of cataracts , cardiovascular disease , and stroke .
Andrew Lycett , an Ian Fleming biographer , believed that Fleming liked his martinis shaken , not stirred , because Fleming thought that stirring a drink diminished its flavour .
Lycett also noted that Fleming preferred gin and vermouth for his martini .
It has also been said that Fleming was a fan of martinis shaken by Hans Schröder , a German bartender .
Harry Craddock 's Savoy Cocktail Book ( 1930 ) prescribes shaking for all its martini recipes .
However , many bartenders insist that any cocktail that involves nothing but transparent ingredients — such as martinis , manhattans , and negronis — must be stirred in order to maintain clarity and texture .
Shaking a drink is quite violent and necessarily introduces air bubbles into the mix .
This results in a cloudy appearance and a somewhat different texture on the tongue when compared with a stirred drink .
However , when any of the ingredients are opaque ( such as citrus juices , dairy , or eggs ) , aesthetically pleasing clarity and texture are not as much of an issue .
Furthermore , studies have shown that , while techniques and type of ice used to play a role in the final effect of chilling and diluting a drink , both shaking and stirring can result in chilling the drink with equal effectiveness ; stirring takes longer .
However , shaking is much faster , and bartenders do not stir long enough to reach the matching temperature and dilution .
In essence , then , James Bond does not seem to care that his martini will be ugly upon presentation , or he might prefer the " shaken " version for its texture , or for its lower alcohol by volume .
Some connoisseurs believe that shaking gin is a faux pas , supposedly because the shaking " bruises " the gin ( a term referring to a slight bitter taste that can allegedly occur when gin is shaken ) .
In Fleming 's novel Casino Royale , it is stated that Bond " watched as the deep glass became frosted with the pale golden drink , slightly aerated by the bruising of the shaker , " suggesting that Bond was requesting it shaken because of the vodka it contained .
Prior to the 1960s , vodka was , for the most part , refined from potatoes ( usually cheaper brands ) .
This element made the vodka oily .
To disperse the oil , Bond ordered his martinis shaken ; thus , in the same scene where he orders the martini , he tells the barman about how vodka made from grain rather than potatoes makes his drink even better .
Shaking is also said to dissolve the vermouth better , making it less oily tasting .
While properly called a Bradford , a shaken martini also appears cloudier than when stirred .
This is caused by the small fragments of ice present in a shaken martini .
This also brings into question the movie versions , which are never cloudy .
In " Stirred , " an episode of The West Wing , President Josiah Bartlet disagrees with Bond in a conversation with his aide Charlie Young :

DRINKING HABITS
Section::::Other 007 drinking habits .
A general study of Bond 's consumption of alcohol in the series of novels by Fleming was published by three scientists .
SPIRITS Section::::Spirits .
Bond 's drinking habits mirror those of his creator , Ian Fleming .
Fleming , as well as Bond throughout the novels , had a preference for bourbon whiskey .
Fleming himself had had a fondness for gin , drinking as much as a bottle a day ; however , he was converted to bourbon at the behest of his doctor who informed him of his failing health .
Otherwise , in the films James Bond normally has a fondness for vodka that is accompanied by product placement for a brand .
For instance , Smirnoff was clearly shown in 1997 's Tomorrow Never Dies , in which Bond sits drinking a bottle while in his hotel room in Hamburg .
Other brands featured in the films have included Absolut Vodka , Stolichnaya and Finlandia .
In the film GoldenEye , Bond suggests cognac when offered a drink by M , who gives him bourbon instead , as it is her preference .
The whiskey poured is in fact
Jack Daniel 's , which markets itself as a Tennessee Whiskey , which is legally a sub - category of bourbon – often distinguished from bourbon itself .
In Goldfinger , Bond drinks a mint julep at Auric Goldfinger 's Kentucky stud farm , and in Thunderball , Largo gives Bond a Rum Collins .
Bond is also seen in Quantum of Solace drinking bottled beer when meeting with Felix Leiter in a Bolivian bar .
In Die Another Day , Bond drinks a mojito .
In Casino Royale , Bond orders Mount Gay Rum with soda .
In that film , he also invents the famous " Vesper " cocktail — a variation on a martini — originally included in the novel but not seen in the films until the reboot .
In Skyfall , the villain Raoul Silva says he believes 50-year - old Macallan single malt whisky to be one of Bond 's favourites .
Also in Goldfinger during a briefing on the villain , their host offers a refill with , " Have a little more of this rather disappointing brandy . "
M replies , " Why , what is the matter with it ? "
Bond replies , " I 'd say it was a 30-year - old Fine [ as in Fine brandy ] indifferently blended , Sir ...
with an overdose of Bon bois . "
Bon bois is a Cognac region known for its poor soils .
It is a low quality Cognac , and Bond is saying that too much of this was used in the blend .
In the novel Moonraker , it is noted in the card club Blades , Bond adds a single pinch of black pepper to his glass of fine Wolfschmidt vodka , much to M 's consternation , to which Bond says he got into the habit in joints that served villainous home brew .
It sinks all the poisons to the bottom , and Bond got to like the taste .
However , he does admit that he should not have insulted the Club Wolfschmidt .
WINES Section::::Wines .
In several of the Bond films , he is known to prefer Bollinger and Dom Pérignon champagne .
Never primarily a red wine drinker
, Bond tended to favour Château Mouton Rothschild ; a 1947 vintage in Goldfinger , and half a bottle On Her Majesty 's Secret Service , a 1934 ordered by M in Moonraker , and a ' 55 in Diamonds are Forever — where Bond unveiled the assassin Wint posing as a waiter because the latter did n't know that Mouton - Rothschild is a claret .
In the Jeffery Deaver novel Carte Blanche , Bond expresses a knowledge and appreciation of South African wine .
In the film of Diamonds Are Forever , Bond savours a glass of sherry and fools M into thinking Bond has made a mistake when he pronounces a year of make ( " ' 51 " ) .
When Bond is informed that sherry has no vintage , he replies ( to a non - plussed M ) that he was discerning the vintage of the wine on which the sherry is based – 1851 .
OTHERS Section::::Others .
In the film You Only Live Twice , Bond opts for sake over his usual martini , indicating that he especially likes it when it 's served at what he says is the correct temperature of .
Tiger , his host , is impressed and tells Bond he is exceptionally cultured — for a European .
In Licence to Kill when in the dive bar called Barrelhead Bar , he orders the same as his contact , Pam Bouvier , a " Bud with a lime . "
Aside from alcoholic beverages , Bond is a coffee drinker and eschews tea with a passion , believing it to have been a factor in the fall of the British Empire and referring to it as " a cup of mud "
( in Fleming 's Goldfinger ) .
In the novel Live and Let Die , he expresses his fondness for Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee – while in the film adaptation he is shown operating a La Pavoni Europiccola lever coffee machine in the kitchen of his flat .
In the Fleming novel of From Russia With Love he is shown to own a Chemex Coffeemaker and prefers his coffee brewed that way , while in the film version he orders coffee " very black " for breakfast from his hotel 's room service ; in Kerim Bey 's office he asks for his coffee " medium sweet " when offered .
He also accepts a cup , refusing cream or sugar , from Franz Sanchez in Licence to Kill – whereas in Moonraker he refuses a cup of tea offered by Hugo Drax .
In The Living Daylights , Bond tastes a cup of café coffee he is served in the Prater Amusement Park , Vienna , making a face when it is not up to his standards .
