INTRAVENOUS SUGAR SOLUTION Intravenous sugar solution , also known as dextrose solution , is a mixture of dextrose ( glucose ) and water .
It is used to treat low blood sugar or water loss without electrolyte loss .
Water loss without electrolyte loss may occur in fever , hyperthyroidism , high blood calcium , or diabetes insipidus .
It is also used in the treatment of high blood potassium , diabetic ketoacidosis , and as part of parenteral nutrition .
It is given by injection into a vein .
Side effects may include irritation of the vein in which it is given , high blood sugar , and swelling .
Excess use may result in low blood sodium and other electrolyte problems .
Intravenous sugar solutions are in the crystalloid family of medications .
They come in a number of strengths including 5 % , 10 % , and 50 % dextrose .
While they may start out hypertonic they become hypotonic solutions as the sugar is metabolised .
Versions are also available mixed with saline .
Dextrose solutions for medical use became available in the 1920s and 1930s .
It is on the World Health Organization 's List of Essential Medicines , the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system .
The wholesale cost in the developing world is about US$ 1.00–1.80 per liter of 10 % dextrose in water , and it is about US$ 0.60–2.40 per liter of 5 % dextrose in normal saline .
In the United Kingdom a 50 ml vial of 50 % solution costs the NHS 2.01 pounds .
MEDICAL USES Section::::Medical uses .
Administering a 5 % sugar solution peri- and postoperatively usually achieves a good balance between starvation reactions and hyperglycemia caused by sympathetic activation .
A 10 % solution may be more appropriate when the stress response from the reaction has decreased , after approximately one day after surgery .
After more than approximately 2 days , a more complete regimen of total parenteral nutrition is indicated .
In patients with hypernatremia and euvolemia , free water can be replaced using either 5 % D / W or 0.45 % saline .
In patients with fatty - acid oxidation disorders ( FOD ) , 10 % solution may be appropriate upon arrival to the emergency room .
SIDE EFFECTS Section::::Side effects .
Intravenous glucose is used in some Asian countries as a pick - me - up , for " energy , " but is not a part of routine medical care in the United States where a glucose solution is a prescription drug .
Asian immigrants to the United States are at risk if they seek intravenous glucose treatment .
It may be had at store - front clinics catering to Asian immigrants , but , despite having no more effect than drinking sugared water , poses medical risks such as the possibility of infection .
The procedure is commonly called " ringer . "
TYPES Section::::Types .
Types of glucose / dextrose include : *
D5W ( 5 % dextrose in water ) , which consists of 278 mmol / L dextrose
* D5NS ( 5 % dextrose in normal saline ) , which , in addition , contains normal saline ( 0.9 % w / v of NaCl ) .
* D5 1/2NS 5 % dextrose in half amount of normal saline ( 0.45 % w / v of NaCl ) .
* D5LR ( 5 % dextrose in lactated Ringer solution )
* D50 - 50 % dextrose in water
The percentage is a mass percentage , so a 5 % glucose / dextrose solution contains 50 g / L of glucose / dextrose ( 5g/100ml ) .
Glucose provides energy 4 kcal / gram , so a 5 % glucose solution provides 0.2 kcal / ml .
If prepared from dextrose monohydrate , which provides 3.4 kcal / gram , a 5 % solution provides 0.17 kcal / ml .
