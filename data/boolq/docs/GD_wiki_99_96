FERAL CHICKEN
Feral chickens are derived from domestic chickens ( Gallus gallus domesticus ) who have returned to the wild .
Like the red junglefowl ( the closest wild relative of domestic chickens ) , feral chickens will take flight and roost in tall trees and bushes in order to avoid predators at night .
Feral chickens typically form social groups composed of , a dominant cockerel , several hens , and subordinate cocks .
Sometimes the dominant cockerel is designated by a fight between cocks .
