HISTORY EARLY HISTORY Section::::History .
Section::::Early history .
Turner Broadcasting System traces its roots to a billboard company in Savannah purchased by Robert Edward Turner II in the late 1940s .
Turner grew the business , which later became known as Turner Advertising Company .
Robert Edward Turner 's son , Ted Turner , inherited the company when the elder Turner died in 1963 .
After taking over the company , Ted Turner expanded the business into radio and television .
Turner Broadcasting System as a formal entity was incorporated in Georgia in May 1965 .
1970S Section::::1970s .
In 1970 , Ted Turner purchased WJRJ - Atlanta , Channel 17 , a small , struggling Ultra High Frequency station , and renamed it WTCG , for parent company Turner Communications Group .
By careful programming acquisitions , Turner guided the station to success .
During December 1976 , WTCG originated the " superstation " concept , transmitting via satellite to cable systems .
On December 17 , 1976 at 1:00 pm , WTCG Channel 17 's signal was beamed via satellite to its four cable systems in Grand Island , Nebraska ;
Newport News , Virginia ; Troy , Alabama ; and Newton , Kansas .
All four cable systems started receiving the 1948 Dana Andrews - Cesar Romero film Deep Waters already in progress .
The movie had started 30 minutes earlier .
WTCG went from being a little television station to a major TV network that every one of the 24,000 households outside of the 675,000 in Atlanta was receiving coast - to - coast .
WTCG became a so - called Superstation and created a precedent of today 's basic cable television .
HBO had gone to satellite transmissions to distribute its signal nationally in 1975 , but that was a service that cable subscribers were made to pay extra to receive .
Ted Turner 's innovation signaled the start of the basic cable revolution .
In 1979 , the company changed its name to Turner Broadcasting System ,
Inc. ( TBS , Inc. ) and the call letters of its main entertainment channel to WTBS .

In 1981 , Turner Broadcasting System acquired Brut Productions from Faberge Inc.
In 1984 , Turner initiated Cable Music Channel , his competition for WASEC 's MTV .
The channel was short - lived but helped influence the original format of VH1 .
In 1986 , after a failed attempt to acquire CBS , Turner purchased the film studio MGM / UA Entertainment Co. from Kirk Kerkorian for $ 1.5 billion .
Following the acquisition , Turner had an enormous debt and sold parts of the acquisition .
MGM / UA Entertainment was sold back to Kirk Kerkorian .
The MGM / UA Studio lot in Culver City was sold to Lorimar / Telepictures .
Turner kept MGM 's pre - May 1986 film and TV library as well as the Associated Artists Productions library ( the pre-1950 Warner Bros. film library and the Fleischer Studios / Famous Studios Popeye cartoons originally released by Paramount Pictures ) , and the U.S./Canadian distribution rights to the RKO Pictures library .
Turner Entertainment Co. was founded on August 4 , 1986 .
On October 3 , 1988 , the company launched Turner Network Television ( TNT ) .

On February 23 , 2006 , the company agreed to sell the regional entertainment channel Turner South to Fox Entertainment Group .
Fox assumed control of the channel on May 1 , and on October 13 relaunched it as SportSouth - coincidentally , the former name of Fox Sports South when Turner owned this channel in partnership with Liberty Media between 1990 and 1996 .
In May 2006 , Time Warner , which had owned 50 % of Court TV since 1998 , purchased the remaining 50 % from Liberty Media and began running the channel as part of Turner Broadcasting .

On August 14 , 2015 , it was announced that Turner Broadcasting had acquired a majority stake in iStreamPlanet , a Las Vegas - based video streaming services company , in an effort to bolster its over - the - top programming and shift its core technology infrastructure to the cloud .

The deal was reported to be in the neighborhood of $ 200 million .
On October 2015 , Turner launched a streaming - video network named Great Big Story .
In April 2017 , in order to expedite the sale of Time Warner to AT&T by shedding FCC - licensed properties , WPCH - TV was sold to Meredith Corporation , which had already been operating WPCH on its behalf since 2011 as a sister to its local station WGCL - TV .
On March 22 , 2018 , Six Flags and Riverside Group announced a partnership with Turner Asia Pacific to bring attractions based on Tuzki and other Turner - owned IPs to its theme parks in China .
