INDIAN MOTOCYCLE MANUFACTURING COMPANY Indian is an American brand of motorcycles originally produced from 1901 to 1953 in Springfield , Massachusetts , United States .
Hendee Manufacturing Company initially produced the motorcycles , but the name was changed to the Indian Manufacturing Company in 1928 .
The Indian factory team took the first three places in the 1911 Isle of Man Tourist Trophy .
During the 1910s , Indian became the largest manufacturer of motorcycles in the world .
Indian 's most popular models were the Scout , made from 1920 to 1946 , and the Chief , made from 1922 until 1953 , when the Indian Manufacturing Company went bankrupt .
Various organizations tried to perpetuate the Indian brand name in subsequent years , with limited success .
In 2011 , Polaris Industries purchased Indian Motorcycles and moved operations from North Carolina and merged them into their existing facilities in Minnesota and Iowa .
Since August 2013 , Polaris has marketed multiple modern Indian motorcycles that reflect Indian 's traditional styling .
HISTORY EARLY YEARS – HENDEE AND HEDSTROM Section::::History .
Section::::Early years – Hendee and Hedstrom .
The " Indian Co. " was founded as the Hendee Manufacturing Company by George M. Hendee in 1897 to manufacture bicycles .
These were initially badged as " Silver King " and " Silver Queen " brands but the name " American Indian " , quickly shortened to just " Indian " , was adopted by Hendee from 1898 onwards because it gave better product recognition in export markets .
Oscar Hedstrom joined in 1900 .
Both Hendee and Hedstrom were former bicycle racers and manufacturers , and after building three prototypes in Middletown , Connecticut they teamed up to produce a motorcycle with a 1.75 bhp , single - cylinder engine in Hendee 's home town of Springfield .
The motorcycle was successful and sales increased dramatically during the next decade .
In 1901 , a prototype and two production units of the diamond framed Indian Single were successfully designed , built and tested .
The first Indian motorcycles , having chain drives and streamlined styling , were sold to the public in 1902 .
In 1903 , Indian 's co - founder and chief engineer Oscar Hedstrom set the world motorcycle speed record of 56 mph .
In 1904 the company introduced the deep red color that would become Indian 's trademark .
Annual production of Indian motorcycles then exceeded 500 , rising to a peak of 32,000 in 1913 .
The engines of the Indian Single were built by the Aurora Firm in Illinois under license from the Hendee Mfg . Co. until 1906 .
Aurora produced engines under license for Indian from about 1901 to 1907 .
Aurora was also allowed to sell Indian design engines to third parties and pay Indian a fee .
After 1907 , Aurora could make its own complete motorcycles , which it did as Thor , and Indian began manufacturing its own engines .
COMPETITIVE SUCCESSES
Section::::Competitive successes .
In 1905 , Indian built its first V - twin factory racer , and in following years made a strong showing in racing and record - breaking .
In 1907 , the company introduced the first street version V - twin and a roadster styled after the factory racer .
The roadster can be distinguished from the racers by the presence of twist grip linkages .
One of the firm 's most famous riders was Erwin " Cannonball " Baker , who set many long - distance records .
In 1914 , he rode an Indian across America , from San Diego to New York , in a record 11 days , 12 hours and ten minutes .
Baker 's mount in subsequent years was the Powerplus , a side - valve V - twin , which was introduced in 1916 .
Its 61ci ( 1000 cc ) , 42 degree V - twin engine was more powerful and quieter than previous designs , giving a top speed of 60 mph ( 96 km / h ) .
The Powerplus was highly successful , both as a roadster and as the basis for racing bikes .
It remained in production with few changes until 1924 .
Competition success played a big part in Indian 's rapid growth and spurred technical innovation as well .
One of the American firm 's best early results came in the Isle of Man TT in 1911 , when Indian riders Oliver Cyril Godfrey , Franklin and Moorehouse finished first , second and third .
Indian star Jake DeRosier set several speed records , both in America and at Brooklands in Britain , and won an estimated 900 races on dirt and board tracks .
He left Indian for Excelsior and died in 1913 , aged 33 , of injuries sustained in a board track race crash with Charles " Fearless " Balke , who later became Indian 's top rider .
Work at the Indian factory was stopped while DeRosier 's funeral procession passed by .
Oscar Hedstrom left Indian in 1913 after disagreements with the board of directors regarding dubious practices to inflate the company 's stock value .
George Hendee resigned in 1916 .
LIGHTWEIGHTS 1916 - 1919 Section::::Lightweights 1916 - 1919 .
Indian introduced the 221 cc single cylinder two - stroke Model K " Featherweight " in 1916 .
The Model K had an open cradle frame with the engine as a stressed member and a pivoting front fork that had been used earlier on single - cylinder motorcycles but had mostly been replaced on other Indian motorcycles by a leaf - sprung trailing link fork .
The Model K was manufactured for one year and was replaced in 1917 by the Model O.
The Model O had a four - stroke flat - twin engine and a new frame , but retained the pivoting fork at the front .
The Model O was manufactured until 1919 .
WORLD
WAR
I Section::::World War I. As the US entered World War I , Indian sold most of its Powerplus line in 1917 and 1918 to the United States government , starving its network of dealers .
This blow to domestic availability of the motorcycles led to a loss of dealers from which Indian never quite recovered .
While the motorcycles were popular in the military , post - war demand was then taken up by other manufacturers to whom many of the previously loyal Indian dealers turned .
While Indian shared in the business boom of the 1920s , it had lost its Number One position in the US market to Harley - Davidson .
INTER - WAR ERA Section::::Inter - war era .
The Scout and Chief V - twins , introduced in the early 1920s , became the Springfield firm 's most successful models .
Designed by Charles Franklin , the middleweight Scout and larger Chief shared a 42-degree V - twin engine layout .
Both models gained a reputation for strength and reliability .
In 1930 , Indian merged with Du Pont Motors .
DuPont Motors founder E. Paul DuPont ceased production of duPont automobiles and concentrated the company 's resources on Indian .
DuPont 's paint industry connections resulted in no fewer than 24 color options in 1934 .
Models of that era had Indian 's famous war bonnet logo on the gas tank .
Indian 's huge Springfield factory was known as the Wigwam , and native American imagery was much used in advertising .
In 1940 , Indian sold nearly as many motorcycles as its major rival , Harley - Davidson .
During this time , Indian also manufactured other products such as aircraft engines , bicycles , boat motors and air conditioners .
SCOUT Section::::Scout .
The Indian Scout was built from 1920 through 1949 .
It rivaled the Chief as Indian 's most important model .
The Scout was introduced for 1920 .
Designed by Charles B. Franklin , the Scout had its gearbox bolted to the engine and was driven by gears instead of by belt or chain .
The engine originally displaced ; the Scout 45 , with a displacement of , became available in 1927 to compete with the Excelsior Super X. A front brake became standard on the original Scout early in 1928 .
Later in 1928 , the Scout and Scout 45 were replaced by the Model 101 Scout .
Another Franklin design , the 101 Scout had a longer wheelbase and lower seat height than the original .
The 101 Scout was well known for its handling .
The 101 Scout was replaced by the Standard Scout for 1932 .
The Standard Scout shared its frame with the Chief and the Four ; as a result , the Standard Scout was heavier and less nimble than the 101 .
A second line of Scouts was introduced for 1933 .
Based on the frame of the discontinued Indian Prince single - cylinder motorcycle , the Motoplane used the 45 cubic inch engine from the Standard Scout while the Pony Scout had a reduced displacement of .
In 1934 the Motoplane was replaced by the Sport Scout with a heavier but stiffer frame better able to withstand the power of the 45 cubic inch engine , while the Pony Scout , later renamed the Junior Scout , was continued with the Prince / Motoplane frame .
Between the introduction of the Sport Scout in 1934 and the discontinuation of the Standard Scout in 1937 there were three Scout models ( Pony / Junior , Standard , and Sport ) with three different frames .
The Sport Scout and the Junior Scout were continued until civilian production was interrupted in early 1942 .
CHIEF Section::::Chief .
Introduced in 1922 , the Indian Chief had a engine based on the Powerplus engine ; a year later the engine was enlarged to .
Numerous improvements were made to the Chief over the years , including the provision of a front brake in 1928 .
In 1940 , all models were fitted with the large skirted fenders that became an Indian trademark , and the Chief gained a new sprung frame that was superior to rival Harley 's unsprung rear end .
The 1940s Chiefs were handsome and comfortable machines , capable of in standard form and over when tuned , although their increased weight hampered acceleration .
The 1948 Chief had a 74 cubic inch engine , hand shift and foot clutch .
While one handlebar grip controlled the throttle the other was a manual spark advance .
In 1950 , the V - twin engine was enlarged to and telescopic forks were adopted .
But Indian 's financial problems meant that few bikes were built .
Production of the Chief ended in 1953 .
FOUR Section::::Four .
Indian purchased the Ace Motor Corporation in 1927 and moved production of the 4-cylinder Ace motorcycle to Springfield .
It was marketed as the Indian Ace in 1927 .
In 1928 , the Indian Ace was replaced by the Indian 401 , a development of the Ace designed by Arthur O. Lemon , former Chief Engineer at Ace , who was employed by Indian when they bought Ace .
The Ace 's leading - link forks and central coil spring were replaced by Indian 's trailing - link forks and quarter - elliptic leaf spring .
In 1929 , the Indian 401 was replaced by the Indian 402 which received a stronger twin - downtube frame based on the 101 Scout frame and a sturdier five - bearing crankshaft than the Ace , which only had a three - bearing crankshaft .
Despite the low demand for luxury motorcycles during the Great Depression , Indian not only continued production of the Four , but continued to develop the motorcycle .
One of the less popular versions of the Four was the " upside down " engine on the 1936 - 37 models .
While earlier ( and later ) Fours had inlet - over - exhaust ( IOE ) cylinder heads with overhead inlet valves and side exhaust valves , the 1936 - 1937 Indian Four had a unique EOI cylinder head , with the positions reversed .
In theory , this would improve fuel vaporization , and the new engine was more powerful .
However , the new system made the cylinder head , and the rider 's inseam , very hot .
This , along with an exhaust valvetrain that required frequent adjustment , caused sales to drop .
The addition of dual carburetors in 1937 did not revive interest .
The design was returned to the original configuration in 1938 .
Like the Chief , the Four was given large , skirted fenders and plunger rear suspension in 1940 .
In 1941 , the 18-inch wheels of previous models were replaced with 16-inch wheels with balloon tires .
The Indian Four was discontinued in 1942 .
Recognition of the historical significance of the 1940 four - cylinder model was made with an August 2006 United States Postal Service 39-cent stamp issue , part of a four panel set entitled American Motorcycles .
A 1941 model is part of the Smithsonian Motorcycle Collection on display at the National Museum of American History .
Single examples of both the 1931 and 1935 Indian Fours are in the ground vehicle collection of the Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome .
WORLD WAR II Section::::World War II .
During World War II , Chiefs , Scouts , and Junior Scouts were used in small numbers for various purposes by the United States Army and were also used extensively by British and other Commonwealth military services , under Lend Lease programs .
However , none of these Indian models could unseat the Harley - Davidson WLA as the motorcycle mainly used by the US military .
An early war military design by Indian was based on the Scout 640 ( and was often compared to Harley - Davidson 's WLA ) , but was either too expensive or heavy , or a combination of both .
Indian 's later offering , the 741B was not selected to gain a US Military contract .
Indian also made a version based on the Chief , the 344 .
Approximately 1,000 experimental versions mounting the 750 cc motor sideways and using shaft drive , as on a modern Moto Guzzi , the 841 , were also tried . 841 Section::::841 .
During World War II , the US Army requested experimental motorcycle designs suitable for desert fighting .
In response to this request , Indian designed and built the 841 .
Approximately 1,056 models were built .
The Indian 841 was heavily inspired by the BMW R71 motorcycle ( which , though not used by the German Army later was the basis for the Soviet M72 , which is the basis for the Ural and Chiang Jiang motorcycle ) as was its competitor , the Harley - Davidson XA .
However , unlike the XA , the 841 was not a copy of the R71 .
Although its tubular frame , plunger rear suspension , and shaft drive were similar to the BMW 's , the 841 was different from the BMW in several aspects , most noticeably so with its 90-degree longitudinal - crankshaft V - twin engine and girder fork .
The Indian 841 and the Harley - Davidson XA were both tested by the Army , but neither motorcycle was adopted for wider military use .
It was determined that the Jeep was more suitable for the roles and missions for which these motorcycles had been intended .
POST - WAR DECLINE AND DEMISE Section::::Post - war decline and demise .
In 1945 , a group headed by Ralph B. Rogers purchased a controlling interest of the company .
On November 1 , 1945 , duPont formally turned the operations of Indian over to Rogers .
Under Rogers ' control , Indian discontinued the Scout and began to manufacture lightweight motorcycles such as the 149 Arrow , the Super Scout 249 , both introduced in 1949 , and the 250 Warrior , introduced in 1950 .
In 1947 , the Indian - head fender light , also known as the " war bonnet " , was introduced .
The war bonnet backlit lamp was found only on the front fender of an authentic Indian Motorcycle .
Chrome components made their debut .
Production of traditional Indians was extremely limited in 1949 , and no 1949 Chiefs are known to exist .
All product manufacturing ended in 1953 .
CORPORATE SUCCESSORS
REBADGED IMPORTED ROYAL ENFIELDS Section::::Corporate successors .
Section::::Rebadged imported Royal Enfields .
Brockhouse Engineering acquired the rights to the Indian name after Indian went under in 1953 .
[ Clarification needed - Brockhouse bought into the Indian Sales Corp in 1948 ] .
The Indian Sales Corp imported and sold CZ , Vincent , AJS , Matchless , Norton from various dates after this [ source needed .
From 1955 through 1960 , they imported English Royal Enfield motorcycles , mildly customized them in the United States , [ source needed , they may have been factory done , almost certainly ] and sold them as Indians .
Almost all Royal Enfield models had a corresponding Indian model in the US .
The models were Indian Chief , Trailblazer , Apache ( all three were 700 cc twins ) , Tomahawk ( 500 cc twin ) , Woodsman ( 500 cc single ) , Westerner ( 500 cc single ) , Hounds Arrow ( 250 cc single ) , Fire Arrow ( 250 cc single ) , Lance ( 150 cc 2-stroke single ) and a 3-wheeled Patrol Car ( 350 cc single ) .
In 1960 , the Indian name was bought by AMC of the UK .
Royal Enfield being their competition , they abruptly stopped all Enfield - based Indian models except the 700 cc Chief .
Their plan was to sell Matchless and AJS motorcycles badged as Indians .
However , the venture ended when AMC itself went into liquidation in 1962 .
[ Clarification needed - AMC went bust circa 1966 ]
FLOYD CLYMER IMPORTS , 1963 - 1977 Section::::Floyd Clymer imports , 1963 - 1977 .
From the 1960s , entrepreneur Floyd Clymer began using the Indian name , apparently without purchasing it from the last known legitimate trademark holder .
He attached it to imported motorcycles , commissioned to Italian ex - pilot and engineer Leopoldo Tartarini , owner of Italjet Moto , to manufacture Minarelli - engined 50 cc minibikes under the Indian Papoose name .
These were successful so Clymer commissioned Tartarini to build full - size Indian motorcycles based on the Italjet Griffon design , fitted with Royal Enfield Interceptor 750 cc parallel - twin engines .
A further development was the Indian Velo 500 , a limited - production run using a Velocette single - cylinder engine and gearbox with mainly Italian cycle parts , including a lightweight frame from the Italjet company , Marzocchi front forks with Grimeca front hub having a twin - leading shoe brake , Borrani aluminium rims and quickly - detachable tank and seat , resulting in a weight - saving of compared to the traditional Velocette Venom .
The project ended abruptly due to Clymer 's death and the failure of Velocette , with 200 machines shipped to US and a further 50 remaining in Italy , which were bought by London Velocette dealer Geoff Dodkin .
When roadtesting , UK monthly magazine Motorcycle Sport described it as " British engineering and Italian styling in a package originally intended for the American market " , reporting that Dodkin would supply his bikes with either a standard Venom engine specification , or , at higher cost , a Thruxton version .
After Clymer 's death in 1970 his widow sold the alleged Indian trademark to Los Angeles attorney Alan Newman , who continued to import minicycles made by ItalJet , and later manufactured in a wholly owned assembly plant located in Taipei ( Taiwan ) .
Several models with engine displacement between 50 cc and 175 cc were produced , mostly fitted with Italian two - stroke engines made either by Italjet or Franco Morini .
In 1974 , Newman planned to revive large - capacity machines as the Indian 900 , using a Ducati 860 cc engine and commissioned Leo Tartarini of Italjet to produce a prototype .
The project failed , leaving the prototype as the only survivor .
Sales of Newman 's Indians were dwindling by 1975 .
The company was declared bankrupt in January 1977 .
OTHER ATTEMPTS , 1977 - 1999
Section::::Other attempts , 1977 - 1999 .
The right to the brand name passed through a succession of owners and became a subject of competing claims in the 1980s .
By 1992 , the Clymer claim to the trademark had been transferred to Indian Motocycle Manufacturing Co. Inc. of Berlin , a corporation headed by Philip S. Zanghi .
In June 1994 , in Albuquerque , New Mexico , Wayne Baughman , president of Indian Motorcycle Manufacturing Incorporated , presented , started , and rode a prototype Indian Century V - Twin Chief .
Baughman had made previous statements about building new motorcycles under the Indian brand but this was his first appearance with a working motorcycle .
Neither Zanghi nor Baughman began production of motorcycles .
In August 1997 , Zanghi was convicted of securities fraud , tax evasion , and money laundering .
In January 1998 , Eller Industries was given permission to purchase the Indian copyright from the receivers of the previous owner .
Eller Industries hired Roush Industries to design the engine for the motorcycle , and was negotiating with the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians to build a motorcycle factory on their tribal land .
Three renderings , one each of a cruiser , a sport cruiser , and a sport bike , on frames specified by suspension designer James Parker , were shown to the motorcycling press in February 1998 .
Eller Industries arranged a public unveiling of the cruiser prototype for November 1998 , but was prevented from showing the prototype by a restraining order from the receiver , who said that Eller had failed to meet the terms of its obligations .
The contract was withdrawn after the company missed its deadline to close the deal and could not agree with the receiver to an extension on the deadline .
Other conditions , including payment of administrative costs and presenting a working prototype , were also not met by Eller Industries .
Based on this , a Federal bankruptcy court in Denver , Colorado , allowed the sale of the trademark to IMCOA Licensing America Inc. in December 1998 .
INDIAN MOTORCYCLE COMPANY OF AMERICA ( 1999–2003 ) Section::::Indian Motorcycle Company of America ( 1999–2003 ) .
