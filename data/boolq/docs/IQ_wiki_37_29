On September 10 , 2014 , a third Jump Street film was confirmed .

On December 10 , 2014 , it was revealed that Sony was planning a crossover between Men in Black and Jump Street .
The news was leaked after Sony 's system was hacked and then confirmed by the directors of the films , Chris Miller and Phil Lord , during an interview about it .
James Bobin was announced as the director in January 2016 .
The title of the crossover was later revealed to be MIB 23 , and the crossover would replace a 23 Jump Street film .
By August 2016 , Jonah Hill considered that MIB 23 would be hard to make , as " They 're trying to make all the deals , but it 's kind of impossible with all the Men in Black stuff " , and " it 's hard to maintain that joke when it 's so high stakes " given the film would get too close to the sort of remake , sequel and reboot the previous films mocked .
Still , Hill hoped to make a third Jump Street .
In December 2016 it was revealed that Rodney Rothman had written a script for the film , and that Bobin is still attached as director for the movie .
It was later confirmed that the film has been slated for a 2021 release .
