ONLINE
GAMBLING
Section::::Online gambling .
The Interactive Gambling Act ( 2001 ) was passed by the Australian Commonwealth Parliament on 28 June 2001 .
It received assent on 11 July 2001
The Act is targeted at online gambling operators , making it an offense for them to offer ' real - money ' online interactive gambling to residents of Australia .
It also makes it illegal for online gambling operators to advertise ' real - money ' interactive gambling services ( such as online poker and casino ) to Australian citizens .
That being said , the amount spent on online gaming by Australians reached some $ 800 million by 2010 , according to the official 2010 Productivity Report of the Australian Government .
Accessing and using the interactive gambling services is not an offence .
It is also allowed to companies based in Australia to offer their gambling services to gamblers located outside Australia with the exception of those countries that were called ' designated countries ' .
TAXATION LAWS ON GAMBLING IN AUSTRALIA Section::::Taxation laws on gambling in Australia .
Gamblers ' winnings in Australia are not taxed .
There are 3 main reasons for that :
* Gambling is not considered a profession , it 's treated as a hobby or recreational activity .
*
The Australian government views gains from gambling activities not as income , but as a result of good luck .
Even if someone wins big , they also lose a lot in other gambling sessions .
*
The government taxes gambling operators instead .
Taxation of gambling operators in Australia differs from state to state and different gambling services are taxed in a different way .
There are taxes on the turnover , on player loss and net profit .
As gambling operators need to obtain a license to offer their services , certain fees must also be paid at this stage of gambling business development .
The use of different tax rates and tax bases makes it difficult to compare taxes across states .
For example , the ACT 's keno tax rate of 2.53 % of turnover is equivalent to a tax rate on gross profits of 10.12 % .
