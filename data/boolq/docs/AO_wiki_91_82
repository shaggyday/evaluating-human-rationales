RADICLE
In botany , the radicle is the first part of a seedling ( a growing plant embryo ) to emerge from the seed during the process of germination .
The radicle is the embryonic root of the plant , and grows downward in the soil ( the shoot emerges from the plumule ) .
Above the radicle is the embryonic stem or hypocotyl , supporting the cotyledon(s ) .
It is the embryonic root inside the seed .
It is the first thing to emerge from a seed and down into the ground to allow the seed to suck up water and send out its leaves so that it can start photosynthesizing .
The radicle emerges from a seed through the micropyle .
Radicles in seedlings are classified into two main types .
Those pointing away from the seed coat scar or hilum are classified as antitropous , and those pointing towards the hilum are syntropous .
If the radicle begins to decay , the seedling undergoes preemergence damping - off .
This disease appears on the radicle as darkened spots .
Eventually , it causes death of the seedling .
The plumule is the baby shoot .
It grows after the radicle .
In 1880 Charles Darwin published a book about plants he had studied , The Power of Movement in Plants , where he mentions the radicle .
