DUKE 'S MAYONNAISE
Duke 's Mayonnaise is a condiment created by Mrs. Eugenia Duke at Duke 's sandwich shop of Greenville , South Carolina , in 1917 .
While it is the third - largest mayonnaise brand in the United States ( behind Hellmann 's and Kraft ) , its popularity was at first largely limited to the South .
It is used in regional favorites such as tomato sandwiches , cole slaw , deviled eggs , pimento cheese , and potato salad .
Duke 's Mayonnaise contains more egg yolks than other mayonnaise products and no added sugar , giving it a tangy flavor .
By 2017 , in the centennial year of its original recipe , Duke 's mayonnaise became available throughout the United States and also in New Zealand , Australia and the Middle East .
In 2017 Sauer announced that it was also starting sales to Latin America .
C.F. Sauer Company in Richmond
, Virginia purchased the Duke 's Products in 1929 , and Duke 's mayonnaise became the company 's flagship product .
In 2017 , the South Carolina legislature recognized the centennial of Duke 's .
