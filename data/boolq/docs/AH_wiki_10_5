CHEMICAL WEAPONS
CONVENTION
The Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) is an arms control treaty that outlaws the production , stockpiling , and use of chemical weapons and their precursors .
The full name of the treaty is the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development , Production , Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction and it is administered by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) , an intergovernmental organization based in The Hague , The Netherlands .
The treaty entered into force in 1997 .
The Chemical Weapons Convention prohibits the large - scale use , development , production , stockpiling and transfer of chemical weapons .
Very limited production for research , medical , pharmaceutical or protective purposes is still permitted .
The main obligation of member states under the convention is to effect this prohibition , as well as the destruction of all current chemical weapons .
All destruction activities must take place under OPCW verification .
As of May 2018 , 193 states have become parties to the CWC and accept its obligations .
Israel has signed but not ratified the agreement , while three other UN member states ( Egypt , North Korea and South Sudan ) have neither signed nor acceded to the treaty .
Most recently , the State of Palestine deposited its instrument of accession to the CWC on 17 May 2018 .
In September 2013 Syria acceded to the convention as part of an agreement for the destruction of Syria 's chemical weapons .
As of January 2018 , over 96 % of the world 's declared chemical weapons stockpiles had been destroyed .
The convention has provisions for systematic evaluation of chemical production facilities , as well as for investigations of allegations of use and production of chemical weapons based on intelligence of other state parties .
Some chemicals which have been used extensively in warfare but have numerous large - scale industrial uses such as phosgene are highly regulated , however , certain notable exceptions exist .
Chlorine gas is highly toxic , but being a pure element and extremely widely used for peaceful purposes , is not officially listed as a chemical weapon .
Certain state - powers ( e.g. the Assad regime of Syria ) continue to regularly manufacture and implement such chemicals in combat munitions .
Although these chemicals are not specifically listed as controlled by the CWC , the use of any toxic chemical as a weapon ( when used to produce fatalities solely or mainly through its toxic action ) is in - and - of itself forbidden by the treaty .
Other chemicals , such as white phosphorus , are highly toxic but are legal under the CWC when they are used by military forces for reasons other than their toxicity .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Intergovernmental consideration of a chemical and biological weapons ban was initiated in 1968 within the 18-nation Disarmament Committee , which , after numerous changes of name and composition , became the Conference on Disarmament ( CD ) in 1984 .
On 3 September 1992 the Conference on Disarmament submitted to the U.N. General Assembly its annual report , which contained the text of the Chemical Weapons Convention .
The General Assembly approved the Convention on 30 November 1992 , and the U.N. Secretary - General then opened the Convention for signature in Paris on 13 January 1993 .
The CWC remained open for signature until its entry into force on 29 April 1997 , 180 days after the deposit of the 65th instrument of ratification ( by Hungary ) .
The convention augments the Geneva Protocol of 1925 for chemical weapons and includes extensive verification measures such as on - site inspections .
It does not , however , cover biological weapons .
ORGANISATION FOR THE PROHIBITION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS ( OPCW ) Section::::Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) .
The convention is administered by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) , which acts as the legal platform for specification of the CWC provisions .
The Conference of the States Parties is mandated to change the CWC and pass regulations on implementation of CWC requirements .
The Technical Secretariat of the organization conducts inspections to ensure compliance of member states .
These inspections target destruction facilities ( where permanent monitoring takes place during destruction ) , chemical weapons production facilities which have been dismantled or converted for civil use , as well as inspections of the chemical industry .
The Secretariat may furthermore conduct " investigations of alleged use " of chemical weapons and give assistance after use of chemical weapons .
The 2013 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the organization because it had , with the Chemical Weapons Convention , " defined the use of chemical weapons as a taboo under international law " according to Thorbj√∏rn Jagland , Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee .
KEY POINTS OF THE CONVENTION * Prohibition of production and use of chemical weapons
* Destruction ( or monitored conversion to other functions ) of chemical weapons production facilities
* Destruction of all chemical weapons ( including chemical weapons abandoned outside the state parties territory ) * Assistance between State Parties and the OPCW in the case of use of chemical weapons * An OPCW inspection regime for the production of chemicals which might be converted to chemical weapons
* International cooperation in the peaceful use of chemistry in relevant areas CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES Section::::Key points of the Convention .
Section::::Controlled substances .
The convention distinguishes three classes of controlled substance , chemicals that can either be used as weapons themselves or used in the manufacture of weapons .
The classification is based on the quantities of the substance produced commercially for legitimate purposes .
Each class is split into Part A , which are chemicals that can be used directly as weapons , and Part B , which are chemicals useful in the manufacture of chemical weapons .
Separate from the precursors , the convention defines toxic chemicals as " [ a]ny chemical which through its chemical action on life processes can cause death , temporary incapacitation or permanent harm to humans or animals .
This includes all such chemicals , regardless of their origin or of their method of production , and regardless of whether they are produced in facilities , in munitions or elsewhere . "
* Schedule 1 chemicals have few , or no uses outside chemical weapons .
These may be produced or used for research , medical , pharmaceutical or chemical weapon defence testing purposes but production at sites producing more than 100 grams per year must be declared to the OPCW .
A country is limited to possessing a maximum of 1 tonne of these materials .
Examples are sulfur mustard and nerve agents , and substances which are solely used as precursor chemicals in their manufacture .
A few of these chemicals have very small scale non - military applications , for example milligram quantities of nitrogen mustard are used to treat certain cancers .
* Schedule 2 chemicals have legitimate small - scale applications .
Manufacture must be declared and there are restrictions on export to countries that are not CWC signatories .
An example is thiodiglycol which can be used in the manufacture of mustard agents , but is also used as a solvent in inks .
* Schedule 3 chemicals have large - scale uses apart from chemical weapons .
Plants which manufacture more than 30 tonnes per year must be declared and can be inspected , and there are restrictions on export to countries which are not CWC signatories .
Examples of these substances are phosgene ( the most lethal chemical weapon employed in WWI ) , which has been used as a chemical weapon but which is also a precursor in the manufacture of many legitimate organic compounds ( e.g. pharmaceutical agents and many common pesticides ) , and triethanolamine , used in the manufacture of nitrogen mustard but also commonly used in toiletries and detergents .
A treaty party may declare a " single small - scale facility " that produces up to 1 tonne of Schedule 1 chemicals for research , medical , pharmaceutical or protective purposes each year , and also another facility may produce 10 kg per year for protective testing purposes .
An unlimited number of other facilities may produce Schedule 1 chemicals , subject to a total 10 kg annual limit , for research , medical or pharmaceutical purposes , but any facility producing more than 100 grams must be declared .
The treaty also deals with carbon compounds called in the treaty " discrete organic chemicals " , the majority of which exhibit moderate - high direct toxicity or can be readily converted into compounds with toxicity sufficient for practical use as a chemical weapon .
These are any carbon compounds apart from long chain polymers , oxides , sulfides and metal carbonates , such as organophosphates .
The OPCW must be informed of , and can inspect , any plant producing ( or expecting to produce ) more than 200 tonnes per year , or 30 tonnes if the chemical contains phosphorus , sulfur or fluorine , unless the plant solely produces explosives or hydrocarbons .
MEMBER STATES Section::::Member states .
165 states signed the CWC prior to its entry into force in 1997 , allowing them to ratify the agreement after obtaining domestic approval .
Following the treaty 's entry into force , it was closed for signature and the only method for non - signatory states to become a party was through accession .
As of May 2018 , 193 states , representing over 98 percent of the world 's population , are party to the CWC .
Of the four United Nations member states that are not parties to the treaty , Israel has signed but not ratified the treaty , while Egypt , North Korea , and South Sudan have neither signed nor acceded to the Convention .
Taiwan , though not a Member State , has stated that it complies with the treaty .
KEY ORGANIZATIONS OF MEMBER STATES Section::::Key organizations of member states .
Member states are represented at the OPCW by their Permanent Representative .
This function is generally combined with the function of Ambassador .
For the preparation of OPCW inspections and preparation of declarations , member states have to constitute a National Authority .

IRAQI STOCKPILE Section::::Iraqi stockpile .
The U.N. Security Council ordered the dismantling of Iraq 's chemical weapon stockpile in 1991 .
By 1998 , UNSCOM inspectors had accounted for the destruction of 88,000 filled and unfilled chemical munitions , over 690 metric tons of weaponized and bulk chemical agents , approximately 4,000 tonnes of precursor chemicals , and 980 pieces of key production equipment .
The UNSCOM inspectors left in 1998 .
In 2009 , before Iraq joined the CWC , the OPCW reported that the United States military had destroyed almost 5,000 old chemical weapons in open - air detonations since 2004 .
These weapons , produced before the 1991 Gulf War , contained sarin and mustard agents but were so badly corroded that they could not have been used as originally intended .
When Iraq joined the CWC in 2009 , it declared " two bunkers with filled and unfilled chemical weapons munitions , some precursors , as well as five former chemical weapons production facilities " according to OPCW Director General Rogelio Pfirter .
The bunker entrances were sealed with 1.5 meters of reinforced concrete in 1994 under UNSCOM supervision .
As of 2012 , the plan to destroy the chemical weapons was still being developed , in the face of significant difficulties .
In 2014 , ISIS took control of the site .
On 13 March 2018 , the Director - General of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) , Ambassador Ahmet √úz√ºmc√º , congratulated the Government of Iraq on the completion of the destruction of the country 's chemical weapons remnants .
SYRIAN DESTRUCTION
Section::::Syrian destruction .
Following the August 2013 Ghouta chemical attack , Syria , which had long been suspected of possessing chemical weapons , acknowledged them in September 2013 and agreed to put them under international supervision .
On 14 September Syria deposited its instrument of accession to the CWC with the United Nations as the depositary and agreed to its provisional application pending entry into force effective 14 October .
An accelerated destruction schedule was devised by Russia and the United States on 14 September , and was endorsed by United Nations Security Council Resolution 2118 and the OPCW Executive Council Decision EC - M-33 / DEC.1 .
Their deadline for destruction was the first half of 2014 .
Syria gave the OPCW an inventory of its chemical weapons arsenal and started its destruction in October 2013 , 2 weeks before its formal entry into force , while applying the convention provisionally .
All declared Category 1 materials were destroyed by August 2014 .
However , the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack in April 2017 revealed that undeclared stockpiles likely remained in the country .
A suspected chemical attack on Douma took place on 7 April 2018 that killed at least 49 civilians with scores injured , and which has been blamed on the Assad government .
FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR DESTRUCTION
Section::::Financial support for destruction .
Financial support for the Albanian and Libyan stockpile destruction programmes was provided by the United States .
Russia received support from a number of countries , including the United States , the United Kingdom , Germany , the Netherlands , Italy and Canada ; with some $ 2 billion given by 2004 .
Costs for Albania 's program were approximately US$ 48 million .
The United States has spent $ 20 billion and expected to spend a further $ 40 billion .
KNOWN CHEMICAL WEAPONS PRODUCTION
FACILITIES Section::::Known chemical weapons production facilities .
Fourteen states parties have declared chemical weapons production facilities ( CWPFs ) : } * 1 non - disclosed state party ( referred to as " A State Party " in OPCW - communications ; said to be South Korea )
As of October 2017 , all 97 declared production facilities had been deactivated and ( 91 ) have been certified as either destroyed ( 68 ) or converted ( 23 ) to civilian use .
