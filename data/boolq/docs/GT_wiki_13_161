GAMEPLAY
Section::::Gameplay .
Black Ops is a first - person shooter , retaining the same gameplay mechanics as previous Call of Duty titles .
The player assumes the role of a foot soldier who can wield various firearms ( only two of which can be carried at once ) , throw grenades and other explosives , and use other equipment as weapons .
A player close enough to an enemy can kill with one knife blow .
A character can take three stances : standing , crouching or prone .
Each affects rate of movement , accuracy , and stealth .
The player can drop to the prone stance from the standing stance while running ( colloquially known as " dolphin diving " ) , and can momentarily sprint before having to stop .
The screen glows red to indicate damage to a player 's health , which regenerates over time .
When the character is within the blast radius of a live grenade , an on - screen marker indicates where it is in relation to the player , helping the player to move away or to throw it back .
Among the weapons new to the series in Black Ops are crossbows with bolts and explosive ammunition , Dragon 's Breath rounds and ballistic knives .
The player assumes the role of various characters during the single - player campaign , changing perspectives throughout the story .
The playable characters are special forces operatives conducting black operations behind enemy lines .

Each mission features a series of objectives that are displayed on the heads - up display , which marks the direction and distance towards and from such objectives as it has been in the earlier versions .
The player is accompanied by friendly troops throughout the game .
Although primarily a first - person shooter , certain levels feature sequences where the player pilots a Hind helicopter and guides friendly troops from a SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance aircraft .
The campaign features several scripted cinematic moments .
One of them is a bullet time effect during the " Victor Charlie " level , activated when the player fires toward the last enemy of a Viet Cong squad .

STORY Section::::Story .
On February 25 , 1968 , SAD operative Alex Mason is strapped to a chair in an interrogation room , bombarded with questions by his unseen captors about the location of a numbers station .
Mason then recalls several events , as an attempt to answer their questions .
On April 17 , 1961 , Mason , Woods , and Bowman take part in Operation 40 to assassinate Fidel Castro in Cuba during the Bay of Pigs Invasion .
Mason apparently succeeds and stays behind to protect the extraction plane from an oncoming blockade , before being captured by the real Castro , having shot a double .
Handed over to Major General Nikita Dragovich to be held captive at Vorkuta Gulag , Mason befriends inmate and former Red Army soldier Viktor Reznov .
Reznov recounts to Mason the identities of their enemies :
Dragovich , his right - hand man Lev Kravchenko , and ex - Nazi scientist Friedrich Steiner , who defected to the Soviet Union .
In October 29 , 1945 , Reznov and were sent to extract Steiner from a Nazi base in the Arctic .
However , they were betrayed by Dragovich , who tested Steiner 's nerve gas known as " Nova 6 " on Petrenko , killing him .
Reznov was spared the same fate when British Commandos , also interested in acquiring Nova 6 , attacked the Soviets .
Reznov destroyed the Nova 6 and escaped , only to be captured by the Soviets and sent to Vorkuta .
The Soviets later recreated Nova 6 with the help of a British scientist , Daniel Clarke .
Having spent over a year imprisoned , Mason and Reznov spark an uprising to flee the gulag , but only Mason manages to escape .
On November 10 , 1963 , Mason meets with President John F. Kennedy , who authorizes a mission to assassinate Dragovich ; Mason briefly envisions aiming a handgun at Kennedy .
Mason , Woods , Bowman , and Weaver are dispatched to the Baikonur Cosmodrome to disrupt the Soviet space program and eliminate members of " Ascension " , a Soviet program giving sanctuary to Nazi scientists in exchange for their knowledge .
The team destroys the Soyuz spacecraft , while Woods apparently kills Dragovich in a car explosion with a commandeered BTR .
On January 21 , 1968 , Mason 's team is sent to Vietnam .
After defending Khe Sanh , they recover a dossier on Dragovich from a Russian defector in Hue City during the Tet Offensive .
The defector turns out to be none other than Reznov , who joins them as they penetrate Laos to recover a Nova 6 shipment from a downed Soviet plane .
They are captured by Viet Cong and Spetznaz infiltrators at the crash site .
Bowman is executed , but Woods and Mason hijack an Mi-24 Hind in the confusion and escape , moving on to rescue Reznov from Kravchenko 's base .
They confront Kravchenko and Woods stabs him , but Kravchenko pulls the pins off of four grenades strapped to himself , forcing Woods to sacrifice himself by pushing both himself and Kravchenko out of a window .
In a huge explosion , Mason presumes the two dead .
Meanwhile , Hudson and Weaver interrogate Clarke in Kowloon City .
Clarke reveals the location of a hidden facility in Mount Yamantau before being killed by Dragovich 's men .
Hudson and Weaver move to destroy the facility and receive a transmission from Steiner requesting to meet at Rebirth Island , as Dragovich has begun killing loose ends .
Mason and Reznov head there to assassinate Steiner at the same time , succeeding just as Hudson and Weaver arrive .
Mason is adamant that Reznov executed Steiner , but Hudson had witnessed Mason carrying out the act alone .
Hudson and Weaver are revealed to be Mason 's interrogators .
Dragovich has communist sleeper cells placed all over the United States which , when ordered by the numbers broadcast , will release the Nova 6 gas .
As a result , the U.S. is preparing a pre - emptive nuclear strike on the Soviet Union , which would result in the inevitable Mutual Assured Destruction of World War III .
Hudson needed Steiner to abort the gas launch , but after his death , only Mason has any knowledge of the numbers station .
Hudson reveals that Dragovich brainwashed Mason to understand the numbers broadcasts and assassinate Kennedy , effectively making him a Soviet sleeper agent .
The real Reznov never escaped , but died during the Vorkuta breakout attempt , and the Soviet defector in Hue was actually killed before Mason reached him .
Mason 's visions of Reznov are a result of a dissociative disorder caused by the traumatic brainwashing program .
Prior to the Vorkuta uprising , Reznov reprogrammed Mason to assassinate Dragovich , Kravchenko , and Steiner instead .
Mason finally remembers the location of the broadcast station : a Russian cargo ship called Rusalka off the coast of Cuba .
An assault on the Rusalka begins , with Mason and Hudson infiltrating the underwater submarine base protecting the ship .
Hudson calls in the United States Navy to destroy the Rusalka .
Mason and Hudson finally confront Dragovich in the lower levels of the facility , and Mason strangles and drowns him to death before escaping with Hudson .
They regroup with Weaver , who declares victory .
Archive footage of President Kennedy prior to his assassination on November 22 , 1963 is shown , revealing Mason was among onlookers who watched Kennedy disembark from Air Force One at Love Field .
His presence , and Dragovich 's taunt before his death , suggest that Mason may have carried out his initial programming .
A hidden message that can be accessed in the game 's main menu reveals that Woods survived the confrontation with Kravchenko and is currently incarcerated in the Hanoi Hilton .

STORY Section::::Story .
During World War II , Doctor Ludvig Maxis formed Group 935 , a group of scientists that was intended to improve the human condition .
Lacking funds , they soon turned to creating superweapons to aid the Nazis .
Their discovery of Element 115 from a meteorite in Japan lead to the creation of zombies .
Maxis and his assistant , Dr. Edward Richtofen , also work on other projects , leading to the creation of teleportation devices and 115-powered weapons .
Attempting to use himself as a test subject , Richtofen accidentally teleports to a catacomb within the Moon , where he comes into contact with a mysterious pyramid device that causes him to hear mysterious voices , slowly taking away his sanity .
He is later teleported to an exotic jungle known as Shangri - La , where he spends three weeks studying the Vril energy force .
Upon returning to Germany , Richtofen secretly forms a plan to kill Maxis , and gathers many members of Group 935 to build a moon base , known as Griffin Station .
While maintaining his cover with Maxis and the rest of Group 935 , Richtofen manages to capture three soldiers : Tank Dempsey , Nikolai Belinski , and Takeo Masaki ; he begins to conduct experiments with Element 115 , causing memory loss for all three soldiers .
Maxis continues his work on other experiments , attempting to use his daughter 's dog , Fluffy , as a test subject for his own teleportation device .
However , the experiment fails , and Fluffy is transformed into an undead Hellhound .
Richtofen takes the opportunity and traps Maxis and his daughter Samantha inside the teleporter with Fluffy , believing that they would die .
Richtofen escapes with his three captured soldiers , and arrives at the Rising Sun research facility in Japan , where Element 115 was first discovered .
After gathering a sample of 115 at the site , and recovering a weapon known as the Wunderwaffe DG-2 , they return to the Der Riese factory in Germany .
In an attempt to escape the zombie horde , the group accidentally overloads a teleporter with the DG-2 , sending them forward in time .
They arrive at an abandoned Nazi theater in the 1960s , where Richtofen discovers several recordings left behind by Dr. Maxis .
Samantha , having survived and managing to control the zombies , continues raising the undead in order to hunt down Richtofen .
Some time in 1963 , the United States government manages to grab hold of several of Group 935 's inventions , keeping them hidden in the Pentagon .
Due to the presence of the undead - raising Element 115 , zombies breach the Pentagon .
John F. Kennedy , Richard Nixon , Robert McNamara , and Fidel Castro are trapped within the Pentagon , forced to fight their way out .
Meanwhile , Richtofen 's crew arrive at a Soviet Cosmodrome site , where Richtofen intends to travel to Group 935 's moon base , Griffin Station .
The crew is contacted by Gersh , a member of the Ascension Group who requests to be freed from Samantha 's grip .
After freeing Gersh , the four of them are teleported further in time , and arrive at a Siberian lighthouse sometime in 2011 , once used by Richtofen as a secret lab .
However , they are trapped within a locked room , and forced to rely on four movie actors : Sarah Michelle Gellar , Danny Trejo , Robert Englund , and Michael Rooker , who are filming a zombie movie on - site along with director George A. Romero , who had been infected as well .
Richtofen requests the four celebrities to find a golden rod , which is a Vril generator device , which he then uses to fix the teleporter .
He transports himself and the other three soldiers back to Shangri - La , leaving the celebrities behind to continue fighting Romero and the horde .
At Shangri - La , the group discovers two explorers , Gary and Brock , who died trapped within a time loop while trying to discover the secrets of the mythical Agartha realm .
The group saves the explorers ' lives by traveling back and forth in time , altering the environments of the temple in the process .
They discover an altar within the temple with Richtofen 's name written on it , as well as a piece of a meteorite containing Element 115 .
However , the explorers remain stuck in the never - ending loop .
With the Vril generator and the meteorite piece , Richtofen now believes he can control the zombies , and returns to Griffin Station .
Here , they attempt to activate the MPD , a machine that controls the Aether energy , which opens to reveal Samantha inside ; instead of dying by Richtofen 's trap , Samantha was teleported to the moon while Maxis was sent somewhere else .
Samantha accidentally triggered the MPD and was trapped within the device , but this also allowed her to enter the Aether realm .
Maxis , who was retrieved by Group 935 scientists , apologized to his daughter and committed suicide in front of her , prompting her to assume control of the zombies and seek vengeance on Richtofen .
Richtofen fuses the golden rod and the meteorite piece , and using it to switch souls with Samantha , takes over as the new zombie controller .
This causes his former allies to feel betrayed , and they ally themselves with Samantha ( who now resides in Richtofen 's body ) .
Maxis is revealed to have become a sentient artificial intelligence living within the systems of Griffin Station , and he guides his daughter and the three soldiers to launch three missiles at the Earth .
This severs Richtofen 's link with the Aether , but the launch results in the , while still leaving Richtofen in control of the undead .

Several reviewers also complained that the game felt too much like a rail shooter , with PC Gamer branding it " barely interactive " .
Reviewers also noted that the PC version of the game was buggy and had " a number of frustrating problems " , including a lag in multiplayer modes which for some players rendered the game almost " unplayable " .
