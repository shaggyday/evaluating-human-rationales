MADEIRA CAKE Madeira cake is a sponge cake in traditional English cookery .
NAME Section::::Name .
It is sometimes mistakenly thought to originate from the Madeira Islands ; however , that is not the case as it was instead named after Madeira wine , a Portuguese wine from the islands , which was popular in England in the mid 1800s when it was invented , and was often served with the cake .
The confusion arises because Madeirans produce their own traditional Madeira cake – bolo de mel , a dark , spicy , honey cake – which is very different from its English counterpart .
Nowadays , the English Madeira cake is often served with tea or liqueurs .
