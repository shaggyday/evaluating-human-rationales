COMPULSIVE TALKING Compulsive talking ( or talkaholism )
is talking that goes beyond the bounds of what is considered to be socially acceptable .
The main factors in determining if someone is a compulsive talker are talking in a continuous manner or stopping only when the other person starts talking , and others perceiving their talking as a problem .
Personality traits that have been positively linked to this compulsion include assertiveness , willingness to communicate , self - perceived communication competence , and neuroticism .
Studies have shown that most people who are talkaholics are aware of the amount of talking they do , are unable to stop , or do not see it as a problem .
CHARACTERISTICS Section::::Characteristics .
It has been suggested , through research done by Dr. James C. McCroskey and Dr. Virginia P. Richmond , that United States society finds talkativeness attractive .
It is something which is rewarded and positively correlated with leadership and influence .
However , those who compulsively talk are not to be confused with those who are simply highly verbal and vary their quantity of talk .
Compulsive talkers are those who are highly verbal in a manner that varies greatly from the norm and is not in the person 's best interest .
Those who have been characterized as compulsive talkers talk with a greater frequency , dominate conversations , and are less inhibited than others .
They have also been found to be more argumentative and have a positive attitude regarding communication .
Tendencies towards compulsive talking also are more frequently seen in the personality structure of neurotic psychotic extraverts .
It has also been found that talkaholics are never behaviorally shy .
TALKAHOLIC SCALE Section::::Talkaholic scale .
In 1993 James C. McCroskey and Virginia P. Richmond constructed the Talkaholic Scale , a Likert - type model , to help identify those who are compulsive talkers .
A score of 40 or above , which indicates two standard deviations above the norm , would signal someone to be a true talkaholic .
CULTURAL SIMILARITIES Section::::Cultural similarities .
A study done in 1995 of 811 university students in the United States found 5.2 % of that population had results indicating they were talkaholics .
A similar study from the same year with students from New Zealand found similar results , with 4.7 % scoring above 40 .
CONSEQUENCES AND MANAGEMENT Section::::Consequences and management .
Compulsive talking can drive people away , which in turn can leave that person with no social support .
Interrupting , another act that is associated with talkaholics , can signal to other people a lack of respect .
According to Elizabeth Wagele , an author of best - selling books on personality types , there are different ways to handle compulsive talkers .
Such coping techniques include changing the focus of the conversation , taking attention away from the talkaholic , leaving the conversation , and creating a distraction .
