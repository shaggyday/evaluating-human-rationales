AIRLINE ALLIANCE
An airline alliance is an aviation industry arrangement between two or more airlines agreeing to cooperate on a substantial level .
Alliances may provide marketing branding to facilitate travelers making inter - airline codeshare connections within countries .
This branding may involve unified aircraft liveries of member aircraft .
In 2015 , Star Alliance was the largest with 23 % of total scheduled traffic in revenue passenger miles ( RPMs)/revenue passenger kilometres ( RPKs ) , followed by SkyTeam with 20.4 % and Oneworld with 17.8 % , leaving 38.8 % for others .
RATIONALE Section::::Rationale .
Benefits can consist of : * An extended network , often realised through codeshare agreements .
Many alliances started as only codeshare networks .
* Cost reduction from sharing of : * sales offices * maintenance facilities * operational facilities , e.g. catering or computer systems .
* operational staff , e.g. ground handling personnel , at check - in and boarding desks .
* investments and purchases , e.g. in order to negotiate extra volume discounts .
*
Traveler benefits can include : * lower prices due to lowered operational costs for a given route .
* more departure times to choose from on a given route .
* more destinations within easy reach .
* shorter travel times as a result of optimised transfers .
* a wider range of airport lounges shared with alliance members * fast track access on all alliance members if having frequent flyer status * faster mileage rewards by earning miles for a single account on several different carriers .
* round - the - world tickets , enabling travelers to fly over the world for a relatively low price .
Airline alliances may also create disadvantages for the traveler , such as : * Higher prices when competition is erased on a certain route .
* Less frequent flights : for instance , if two airlines separately fly three and two times a day respectively on a shared route , their alliance might fly less than 5 ( 3 + 2 ) times a day on the same route .
This might be especially true between hub cities for each airline .
e.g. , flights between Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport ( a Delta Air Lines fortress hub ) and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol ( a KLM fortress hub ) .
ISSUES Section::::Issues .
The ability of an airline to join an alliance may be restricted by laws and regulations or subject to approval by authorities .
Competition law issues must also be considered in some countries .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The first airline alliance was formed in the 1930s , when Panair do Brasil and its parent company Pan American World Airways agreed to exchange routes to Latin America .
In 1990 , the African Joint Air Services ( AJAS ) Accord between Tanzania , Uganda and Zambia led to the launch of Alliance Air in 1994 , with South African Airways , Air Tanzania , Uganda Airlines and the governments of Uganda and Tanzania as shareholders .
The first large alliance began in 1989 , when Northwest Airlines and KLM agreed to large - scale codesharing .
In 1992 , the Netherlands signed the first open skies agreement with the United States , in spite of objections from the European Union , which gave both countries unrestricted landing rights on the other 's soil .
Normally landing rights are granted for a fixed number of flights per week to a fixed destination .
Each adjustment requires negotiations , often between governments rather than between the companies involved .
In return , the United States granted antitrust immunity to the alliance between Northwest Airlines and KLM .
Other alliances would struggle for years to overcome the transnational barriers and lack of antitrust immunity , and still do so .
The Star Alliance was founded in 1997 , which brought competing airlines to form Oneworld in 1999 and SkyTeam in 2000 .
In 2010 Richard Branson , chairman of the Virgin Group , announced his intention to form a fourth alliance among Virgin branded airlines ( Virgin Atlantic ; Virgin America ; and the Virgin Australia Holdings group of airlines ) .
Then in September 2011 , Branson said that Virgin Atlantic would join one of the existing alliances ; this idea was repeated in October 2012 .
In December 2012 , Delta Air Lines purchased Singapore Airlines ' 49 % stake in Virgin Atlantic for £ 224 million .
Virgin America was absorbed into Alaska Airlines , which is not a member of any alliance , in April 2018 .
On February 14 , 2013 , it was announced that American Airlines and US Airways would merge , retaining the American Airlines name and would remain in the Oneworld alliance .
US Airways ' participation in the Star Alliance lapsed .
In 2012 , in South America , LAN Airlines and TAM Airlines began their merger .
In March 2014 , with the merger complete , TAM left Star Alliance and became part of LAN in Oneworld .
On September 21 , 2015 , the Vanilla Alliance was formed between several airlines based in the Indian Ocean region , in order to improve air connectivity within the region .
The founding members are Air Austral , Air Mauritius , Air Madagascar , Air Seychelles , and Int'Air Îles .
On January 18 , 2016 , the first alliance of low - cost carriers was formed , U - FLY Alliance .
The founding members — HK Express , Lucky Air , Urumqi Air , and West Air — are all affiliated with HNA Group , although the alliance is also seeking airlines not within the group .
On May 16 , 2016 , the world 's largest alliance of low - cost carriers was formed , Value Alliance .
The founding members are Cebu Pacific , Cebgo , Jeju Air , Nok Air , NokScoot , Scoot Airlines , Tigerair , Tigerair Australia , and Vanilla Air .
