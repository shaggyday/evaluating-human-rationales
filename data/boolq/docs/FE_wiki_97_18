The theatre was built by architect Lewis and William Edward Trent in 1929 for Provincial Cinematograph Theatres , a part of the Gaumont British chain .
The theatre was built with two identical façades on Wilton and Vauxhall Bridge Roads .

By contrast , the entrances feature a cantilevered canopy and are framed by vertical channelling , with two black marble columns rising to the roof line .
The entrance is simple , making use of chrome trimmings , this leads to a nautical themed interior in the original Art Deco style that makes extensive use of concealed lighting , decorated with scallop shells and columns that burst into sculptured fountains at the ceiling .

It was equipped with a Compton 3 manual 15 rank theatre organ , played on the opening night by Reginald Foort .
and the theatre also staged variety shows .
The first show played also during the opening was Hoop - La .
Variety quickly gave way to a specialisation in film performances , with occasional performances by big bands .
In June 1939 , the cinema was one of the three London sites chosen to present a live relay of The Epsom Derby from the pre - war BBC experimental transmissions , utilising Baird equipment to project onto a screen 15 feet by 12 ( 4.6 by 3.7 m ) in sepia .
From September 1940 to May 1941 , the theatre was closed due to World War II , but no serious damage was sustained and it reopened quickly .
Plans were made for demolition in the 1950s , but it was saved and presented a mixture of ballet , live shows and films .
The last films were shown in November 1975 , a double bill of Peter Cushing in Legend of the Werewolf ( 1975 ) and Adrienne Corri in Vampire Circus ( 1972 ) , though the theatre remained open until 1976 , after which it closed for five years .
Led Zeppelin rehearsed there , on May Day , 1980 .
It reopened in 1981 as the Apollo Victoria Theatre with a Shirley Bassey concert .
MUSICAL THEATRE
Section::::Musical theatre .
Musicals , including The Sound of Music , Camelot and Fiddler on the Roof played at the theatre in the early 1980s .
In 1984 , the interior was extensively modified by the introduction of a ' race track ' that ran through the audience , for the show Starlight Express with performers on roller skates .
The show premièred on 27 March , composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and directed by Trevor Nunn and ran for 7,406 performances , over 18 years .
With the removal of the ' tracks ' , the interior was extensively restored by architects Jaques Muir and Partners .
This included the removal of 3,500 incandescent lamps that had become difficult to maintain and consumed a considerable amount of power .
These were replaced by 88,000 low power LEDs specially designed for the theatre , creating the first auditorium completely lit in this way .
Another Lloyd Webber production followed , Bombay Dreams premièred on 19 June 2002 .
It was created by A. R. Rahman with lyrics by Don Black and was directed by Steven Pimlott , closing after 1,500 performances on 13 June 2004 .
This was followed by the return to the West End of the Bee Gee 's musical Saturday Night Fever on 6 July 2004 , closing 22 October 2005 to tour .
This was followed on 10 April 2006 by the jukebox musical Movin '
Out , featuring the music of Billy Joel .
This starred James Fox but ran for only two months .
