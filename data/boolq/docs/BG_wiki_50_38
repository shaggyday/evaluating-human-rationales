UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE Universal health care ( also called universal health coverage , universal coverage , universal care , or socialized health care ) is a health care system that provides health care and financial protection to all citizens of a particular country .
It is organized around providing a specified package of benefits to all members of a society with the end goal of providing financial risk protection , improved access to health services , and improved health outcomes .
Universal health care does not imply coverage for all people for everything .
Universal health care can be determined by three critical dimensions : who is covered , what services are covered , and how much of the cost is covered .
It is described by the World Health Organization as a situation where citizens can access health services without incurring financial hardship .
The Director General of WHO describes universal health coverage as the " single most powerful concept that public health has to offer " since it unifies " services and delivers them in a comprehensive and integrated way " .
One of the goals with universal healthcare is to create a system of protection which provides equality of opportunity for people to enjoy the highest possible level of health .
As part of , United Nations member states have agreed to work toward worldwide universal health coverage by 2030 .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The first move towards a national health insurance system was launched in Germany in 1883 , with the Sickness Insurance Law .
Industrial employers were mandated to provide injury and illness insurance for their low - wage workers , and the system was funded and administered by employees and employers through " sick funds " , which were drawn from deductions in workers ' wages and from employers ' contributions .
Other countries soon began to follow suit .
In the United Kingdom , the National Insurance Act 1911 provided coverage for primary care ( but not specialist or hospital care ) for wage earners , covering about one third of the population .
The Russian Empire established a similar system in 1912 , and other industrialized countries began following suit .
By the 1930s , similar systems existed in virtually all of Western and Central Europe .
Japan introduced an employee health insurance law in 1927 , expanding further upon it in 1935 and 1940 .
Following the Russian Revolution of 1917 , the Soviet Union established a fully public and centralized health care system in 1920 .
However , it was not a truly universal system at that point , as rural residents were not covered .
In New Zealand , a universal health care system was created in a series of steps , from 1939 to 1941 .
In Australia , the state of Queensland introduced a free public hospital system in the 1940s .
Following World War II , universal health care systems began to be set up around the world .
On July 5 , 1948 , the United Kingdom launched its universal National Health Service .
Universal health care was next introduced in the Nordic countries of Sweden ( 1955 ) ,
Iceland ( 1956 ) , Norway ( 1956 ) , Denmark ( 1961 ) , and Finland ( 1964 ) .
Universal health insurance was then introduced in Japan ( 1961 ) , and in Canada through stages , starting with the province of Saskatchewan in 1962 , followed by the rest of Canada from 1968 to 1972 .
The Soviet Union extended universal health care to its rural residents in 1969 .
Italy introduced its Servizio Sanitario Nazionale ( National Health Service ) in 1978 .
Universal health insurance was implemented in Australia beginning with the Medibank system which led to universal coverage under the Medicare system .
From the 1970s to the 2000s , Southern and Western European countries began introducing universal coverage , most of them building upon previous health insurance programs to cover the whole population .
For example , France built upon its 1928 national health insurance system , with subsequent legislation covering a larger and larger percentage of the population , until the remaining 1 % of the population that was uninsured received coverage in 2000 .
In addition , universal health coverage was introduced in some Asian countries , including South Korea ( 1989 ) , Taiwan ( 1995 ) , Israel ( 1995 ) , and Thailand ( 2001 ) .
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , Russia retained and reformed its universal health care system , as did other former Soviet nations and Eastern bloc countries .
Beyond the 1990s , many countries in Latin America , the Caribbean , Africa , and the Asia - Pacific region , including developing countries , took steps to bring their populations under universal health coverage , including China which has the largest universal health care system in the world and Brazil 's SUS which improved coverage up to 80 % of the population .
A 2012 study examined progress being made by these countries , focusing on nine in particular : Ghana , Rwanda , Nigeria , Mali , Kenya , India , Indonesia , the Philippines , and Vietnam .
FUNDING MODELS
Section::::Funding models .
Universal health care in most countries has been achieved by a mixed model of funding .
General taxation revenue is the primary source of funding , but in many countries it is supplemented by specific levies ( which may be charged to the individual and/or an employer ) or with the option of private payments ( by direct or optional insurance ) for services beyond those covered by the public system .
Almost all European systems are financed through a mix of public and private contributions .
Most universal health care systems are funded primarily by tax revenue ( like in Portugal , Spain , Denmark , and Sweden ) .
Some nations , such as Germany , France , and Japan , employ a multipayer system in which health care is funded by private and public contributions .
However , much of the non - government funding is by contributions by employers and employees to regulated non - profit sickness funds .
Contributions are compulsory and defined according to law .
A distinction is also made between municipal and national healthcare funding .
For example , one model is that the bulk of the healthcare is funded by the municipality , speciality healthcare is provided and possibly funded by a larger entity , such as a municipal co - operation board or the state , and the medications are paid by a state agency .
A paper by Sherry A. Glied from Columbia University found that universal health care systems are modestly redistributive , and that the progressivity of health care financing has limited implications for overall income inequality .
COMPULSORY INSURANCE Section::::Compulsory insurance .
This is usually enforced via legislation requiring residents to purchase insurance , but sometimes the government provides the insurance .
Sometimes , there may be a choice of multiple public and private funds providing a standard service ( as in Germany ) or sometimes just a single public fund ( as in Canada ) .
Healthcare in Switzerland and the US Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are based on compulsory insurance .
In some European countries , in which private insurance and universal health care coexist , such as Germany , Belgium , and the Netherlands , the problem of adverse selection is overcome by using a risk compensation pool to equalize , as far as possible , the risks between funds .
Thus , a fund with a predominantly healthy , younger population has to pay into a compensation pool and a fund with an older and predominantly less healthy population would receive funds from the pool .
In this way , sickness funds compete on price , and there is no advantage to eliminate people with higher risks because they are compensated for by means of risk - adjusted capitation payments .
Funds are not allowed to pick and choose their policyholders or deny coverage , but they compete mainly on price and service .
In some countries , the basic coverage level is set by the government and can not be modified .
The Republic of Ireland at one time had a " community rating " system by VHI , effectively a single - payer or common risk pool .
The government later opened VHI to competition but without a compensation pool .
That resulted in foreign insurance companies entering the Irish market and offering cheap health insurance to relatively healthy segments of the market , which then made higher profits at VHI 's expense .
The government later reintroduced community rating by a pooling arrangement and at least one main major insurance company , BUPA , withdrew from the Irish market .
Among the potential solutions posited by economists are single - payer systems as well as other methods of ensuring that health insurance is universal , such as by requiring all citizens to purchase insurance or limiting the ability of insurance companies to deny insurance to individuals or vary price between individuals .
SINGLE PAYER Section::::Single payer .
Single - payer health care is a system in which the government , rather than private insurers , pays for all health care costs .
Single - payer systems may contract for healthcare services from private organizations ( as is the case in Canada ) or own and employ healthcare resources and personnel ( as was the case in England before the introduction of the Health and Social Care Act ) .
" Single - payer " thus describes only the funding mechanism and refers to health care financed by a single public body from a single fund and does not specify the type of delivery or for whom doctors work .
Although the fund holder is usually the state , some forms of single - payer use a mixed public - private system .
TAX - BASED
FINANCING Section::::Tax - based financing .
In tax - based financing , individuals contribute to the provision of health services through various taxes .
These are typically pooled across the whole population , unless local governments raise and retain tax revenues .
Some countries ( notably the United Kingdom , Canada , Ireland , New Zealand , Italy , Spain , Portugal , and the Nordic countries ) choose to fund health care directly from taxation alone .
Other countries with insurance - based systems effectively meet the cost of insuring those unable to insure themselves via social security arrangements funded from taxation , either by directly paying their medical bills or by paying for insurance premiums for those affected .
SOCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE Section::::Social health insurance .
In a social health insurance system , contributions from workers , the self - employed , enterprises , and governments are pooled into a single or multiple funds on a compulsory basis .
It is based on risk pooling .
The social health insurance model is also referred to as the ' Bismarck Model , ' after Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck , who introduced the first universal health care system in Germany in the 19th century .
The funds typically contract with a mix of public and private providers for the provision of a specified benefit package .
Preventive and public health care may be provided by these funds or responsibility kept solely by the Ministry of Health .
Within social health insurance , a number of functions may be executed by parastatal or non - governmental sickness funds or in a few cases , by private health insurance companies .
Social health insurance is used in a number of Western European countries and increasingly in Eastern Europe as well as in Israel and Japan .
PRIVATE INSURANCE Section::::Private insurance .
In private health insurance , premiums are paid directly from employers , associations , individuals , and families to insurance companies , which pool risks across their membership base .
Private insurance includes policies sold by commercial for profit firms , non - profit companies , and community health insurers .
Generally , private insurance is voluntary in contrast to social insurance programs , which tend to be compulsory .
In some countries with universal coverage , private insurance often excludes many health conditions that are expensive and the state health care system can provide .
For example , in the United Kingdom , one of the largest private health care providers is BUPA , which has a long list of general exclusions even in its highest coverage policy , most of which are routinely provided by the National Health Service .
In the United States , dialysis treatment for end stage renal failure is generally paid for by government , not by the insurance industry .
Those with privatized Medicare ( Medicare Advantage ) are the exception and must get their dialysis paid through their insurance company , but with end stage renal failure generally can not buy Medicare Advantage plans .
In the Netherlands , which has regulated competition for its main insurance system ( but subject to a budget cap ) , insurers must cover a basic package for all enrollees , but may choose which additional services they cover in other , supplementary plans ( which most people possess - citation needed ) .
The Planning Commission of India has also suggested that the country should embrace insurance to achieve universal health coverage .
General tax revenue is currently used to meet the essential health requirements of all people .
COMMUNITY - BASED
HEALTH
INSURANCE
Section::::Community - based health insurance .
A particular form of private health insurance that has often emerged if financial risk protection mechanisms have only a limited impact is community - based health insurance .
Individual members of a specific community pay to a collective health fund , which they can draw from when they need of medical care .
Contributions are not risk - related , and there is generally a high level of community involvement in the running of these plans .
IMPLEMENTATION AND COMPARISONS Section::::Implementation and comparisons .
Universal health care systems vary according to the degree of government involvement in providing care and/or health insurance .
In some countries , such as the UK , Spain , Italy , Australia , and the Nordic countries , the government has a high degree of involvement in the commissioning or delivery of health care services and access is based on residence rights , not on the purchase of insurance .
Others have a much more pluralistic delivery system , based on obligatory health with contributory insurance rates related to salaries or income and usually funded by employers and beneficiaries jointly .
Sometimes , the health funds are derived from a mixture of insurance premiums , salary related mandatory contributions by employees and/or employers to regulated sickness funds , and by government taxes .
These insurance based systems tend to reimburse private or public medical providers , often at heavily regulated rates , through mutual or publicly owned medical insurers .
A few countries , such as the Netherlands and Switzerland , operate via privately owned but heavily regulated private insurers , which are not allowed to make a profit from the mandatory element of insurance but can profit by selling supplemental insurance .
Universal health care is a broad concept that has been implemented in several ways .
The common denominator for all such programs is some form of government action aimed at extending access to health care as widely as possible and setting minimum standards .
Most implement universal health care through legislation , regulation , and taxation .
Legislation and regulation direct what care must be provided , to whom , and on what basis .
Usually , some costs are borne by the patient at the time of consumption , but the bulk of costs come from a combination of compulsory insurance and tax revenues .
Some programs are paid for entirely out of tax revenues .
In others , tax revenues are used either to fund insurance for the very poor or for those needing long - term chronic care .
The United Kingdom National Audit Office in 2003 published an international comparison of ten different health care systems in ten developed countries , nine universal systems against one non - universal system ( the United States ) , and their relative costs and key health outcomes .
A wider international comparison of 16 countries , each with universal health care , was published by the World Health Organization in 2004 .
In some cases , government involvement also includes directly managing the health care system , but many countries use mixed public - private systems to deliver universal health care .
