CERTIFIED COPY
A certified copy is a copy ( often a photocopy ) of a primary document that has on it an endorsement or certificate that it is a true copy of the primary document .
It does not certify that the primary document is genuine , only that it is a true copy of the primary document .
A certified copy is often used in English - speaking common law countries as a convenient way of providing a copy of documents .
It is usually inexpensive to obtain .
A certified copy may be required for official government or court purposes and for commercial purposes .
It avoids the owner of important documents ( especially identity documents ) giving up possession of those documents which might mean a risk of their loss or damage .
It has some similarities to a notarized copy , which is a form used in some countries , and particularly in some States in the USA .
A notarized copy is signed by a notary public ( not to be confused with a notary in a civil law country ) .
The certified copy is signed by a person nominated by the person or agency asking for it .
Typically , the person is referred to as an authorised person .
The person who is authorised to sign the certificate will vary between countries .
Sometimes a person is authorised by legislation to do so ( for example a court clerk , solicitor , or notary public ) , but this is not always so .
In some countries , for example the United Kingdom and South Africa , identity documents can also be certified by authorised Post Office staff .
A copy of a primary document that is to be used internationally may have to be in the form of a notarized copy rather than a certified copy .
A notarized copy may be more expensive to obtain .
A copy of a document to be used internationally may also have to comply with special rules - Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents .
If the primary document has to be translated , an additional certificate is usually required .
For example , a birth certificate in Russian is to be used in an English - speaking country .
Typically , the document must be translated professionally and have the professional 's certificate of accuracy attached to the translation together with a copy of the primary document .
Then , the primary document , the translation , and the certificate of accuracy are photocopied in the form of a certified copy .
In the case of a birth certificate in English to be used in Russia , it is possible that a notarized copy will be required .
IN AUSTRALIA Section::::In Australia .
In Australia , certified copies are solely the creation of administrative practice .
There is no specific legislation at federal , State or Territory level .
Certified copies have long been used to give a veneer of authenticity to a photocopy of a primary document .
In practice , they are very easy to obtain at almost no cost other than the photocopy , and are used in a wide range of situations , especially with identity documents .
In practice , and purely for convenience , a copy may usually be certified by a person who is able to witness a statutory declaration under federal legislation about Statutory Declarations .
Categories of people are listed in Schedule 2 of the Statutory Declarations Regulations 1993 ( Cth ) .
Schedule 2 states that Chiropractors , Dentists , Legal practitioners , Medical practitioners , Nurses , Optometrists , Patent attorneys , Pharmacists , Physiotherapists , Psychologists , Trade mark attorneys and Veterinary surgeons may certify copies .
Part 2 of the Schedule lists various other professions and positions , the members or occupants of which may also certify copies ( for example , Judges , Police Officers and Members of Parliament ) .
A typical certificate endorsed on the photocopy , often typed or stamped except for the signature - CERTIFIED TRUE COPY OF THE ORIGINAL
I certify that this is a true copy of the original document .
Signed :
Dated : Authority to sign : Telephone number : Certified copies can be quite basic in Australia due to the lack of legislation .
More detail is often required by the person or agency requiring it .
Sometimes the person or agency will contact the person certifying the copy to limit the possibility of a fraudulent copy .
In some States and Territories , police stations and libraries have arrangements to enable documents to be certified or witnessed by a Justice of the Peace .
This service is free .
IN BOTSWANA Section::::In Botswana .
Photocopies can be certified free at a Police Station .
Certified copies , for example of the " Omang " state identity card , are widely used , and are often required for job applications , etc .
IN INDIA Section::::In
India .
In India , under section 2(j)(ii ) of The Right to Information Act , 2005 , the Public Information Officer ( PIO ) is mandatorily ' required to provide the appellant " Certified copies of documents or records . "
' In such a case , the PIO is only certifying that copies of documents or records are true copies of those held on a ' X ' page of a ' X ' file of the Public Authority , irrespective of their original source .
IN SRI LANKA Section::::In Sri Lanka .
In Sri Lanka , certified copy or true copy of an original document can be attested by an attorney , a notary public or a justice of the peace .
IN THE UNITED STATES Section::::In the United States .
Except for notaries public in some states , there are no officials in the US who are authorized to make certified copies of any kind of document presented to them .
If one is in a state where notaries public are not authorized to make certified copies , one must deal with the entity that issued the original document to obtain a certified copy .
COPY CERTIFICATION
BY U.S. NOTARIES Section::::Copy certification by U.S. notaries .
Some states in the United States permit notaries public to certify copies ; the laws or officials who regulate notaries should be consulted for details .
The U.S. State Department in 2005 compiled a table summarizing the state laws and regulations .
In the table below , notes from the State Department table have been omitted for states that do not authorize notaries to certify copies . !

Wyoming Notaries in many states keep journals of all their notarial acts .
The table shows that in some states notaries may make certified copies of their journals but may not make any other kind of certified copies .
NOTARIZED COPIES OF IDENTIFICATION IN NON - CERTIFYING STATES Section::::Notarized Copies of Identification in Non - Certifying States .
In cases where a bank , government agency , or foreign consulate requires a " notarized copy of photo identification , " and the state prohibits notaries from making certified copies , many of these agencies will accept a copy with a form of affidavit from the holder of the photo identification himself or herself attesting to its authenticity , which is then notarized .
Thus , all the notary is doing is taking and signing an affidavit and not certifying a copy .
The example below is acceptable STATE OF MINNESOTA COUNTY OF HENNEPIN
I BERYL MATHILDA D'SOUZA , being duly sworn , deposes and says : That the above pictured instrument of valid photo identification is a true , exact , and unaltered copy of the valid original , my U.S. Passport , to which I am the instrument 's custodian , named and pictured therein ; and that I presented the original of the above pictured instrument to the undersigned notary public as satisfactory evidence of my identity .
