PLOT Section::::Plot .
One afternoon in San Francisco , Adaline Bowman purchases fake IDs at an apartment before returning home to feed her dog .
She then goes to work and opens a box of film reels , which highlight historical events and times .
A voiceover ties together the film reels explaining the story of Adaline 's life so far .
She was born on New Years Day 1908 , then later married and gave birth to a daughter , only to become a widow after her husband died in a tragic accident .
Years later , in 1937 , Adaline crashed her car when she swerved into a ravine during a snowstorm and died in the freezing lake nearby , but a lightning strike suddenly revived her .
From that moment on , Adaline has stayed physically 29 years old .
One night , two suspicious FBI agents attempt to force her onto an airplane for study , but she escapes captivity and realizes that she will have to spend the rest of her life on the run .
Ever since , she has changed her identification and address according to the era , while her daughter Flemming ages normally , to the point where she appears older than Adaline .
On New Year 's Eve in the present year , she attends a party where she meets Ellis Jones , introducing herself as her current alias , Jennifer .
He asks to see her again but she refuses , knowing she can never fall in love because she can never have a normal future with someone .
The next day at work , Ellis arrives and again asks Adaline to go on a date with him .
Finally she accepts .
In a flashback , Adaline is shown pulling up in a cab to a park where a man is waiting , holding an engagement ring .
Scared , she asks the cab driver to keep going .
Back in the present day , Adaline 's dog falls ill and she begins to ignore Ellis ' calls .
He shows up at her apartment but she pushes him away , only to have a change of heart while looking through some old photographs and realizing she does n't want to live the same year a hundred times without having a natural life .
They later resolve their argument and Ellis asks Adaline to attend the party at his parents ' house celebrating his parents ' fortieth anniversary , and she says yes .
Upon their arrival , Ellis introduces her to his father , William , who recognizes her instantly and calls her Adaline .
She appears to recognize him , too , but lies , telling him that Adaline was her mother , who has since died .
A flashback shows how they met and came to be in love , soon revealing that he was the man with the engagement ring she stood up that afternoon .
One night , Ellis tells Adaline he is falling in love with her
and she is unsure of how to react .
The following day , Adaline talks with William outside and he notices a scar on her left hand , and becomes shaken .
Another flashback reveals that Adaline cut her hand while they were hiking decades ago and he had stitched it up himself .
He realizes that she is truly Adaline and confronts her .
She becomes upset , saying she used to be " normal " and does n't know what changed her .
He begs her not to run , for Ellis ' sake , but she says she does n't know how to stay .
She flees and returns to the house , writing a note to Ellis while he showers , then she packs her things and leaves .
Moments later , Ellis finds the letter and confronts his father , who refuses to explain .
While driving home , Adaline thinks of all the times she has run and suddenly has a change of heart about the way she lives her life .
She stops and calls her daughter to tell her she is going to stop running .
As she turns the car around , a tow truck plows into her in a hit - and - run accident , leaving her to die .
Freezing and helpless , Adaline dies again .
An ambulance arrives and she is revived by the electricity of the defibrillator .
Later in the hospital , she wakes up to Ellis , and the two profess their love for one another .
Adaline then tells him of her 107 years of life .
One year later , Ellis and Adaline are going to a New Year 's Eve party .
As she is leaving , she notices something strange in the hallway mirror : her first grey hair , proving she has begun to age naturally again .
When Ellis asks if she is okay , she responds : " Yes ... Perfect . "
