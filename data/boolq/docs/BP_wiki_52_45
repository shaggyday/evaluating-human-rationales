PRINCETON THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY
Princeton Theological Seminary ( PTS ) is a private , nonprofit , and independent graduate school of theology in Princeton , New Jersey .
Founded in 1812 under the auspices of Archibald Alexander , the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church , and the College of New Jersey ( now Princeton University ) , it is the second - oldest seminary in the United States .
It is also the largest of ten seminaries associated with the Presbyterian Church ( USA ) .
Princeton Seminary has long been influential in theological studies , with many leading biblical scholars , theologians , and clergy among its faculty and alumni .
In addition , it operates one of the largest theological libraries in the world and maintains a number of special collections , including the Karl Barth Research Collection in the Center for Barth Studies .
The Seminary also manages an endowment of $ 986 million , making it the third - wealthiest institution of higher learning in the state of New Jersey — after Princeton University and Rutgers University .
Today , Princeton Seminary enrolls approximately 500 students .
While around 40 % of them are candidates for ministry specifically in the Presbyterian Church , the majority are completing such candidature in other denominations , pursuing careers in academia across a number of different disciplines , or receiving training for other , non - theological fields altogether .
Seminarians hold academic reciprocity with Princeton University as well as the Westminster Choir College of Rider University , New Brunswick Theological Seminary , Jewish Theological Seminary , and the School of Social Work at Rutgers University .
The institution also has an ongoing relationship with the Center of Theological Inquiry .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The plan to establish a theological seminary in Princeton was in the interests of advancing and extending the theological curriculum .
The educational intention was to go beyond the liberal arts course by setting up a postgraduate , professional school in theology .
The plan met with enthusiastic approval on the part of authorities at the College of New Jersey , later to become Princeton University , for they were coming to see that specialized training in theology required more attention than they could give .
The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church established The Theological Seminary at Princeton , New Jersey in 1812 , with the support of the directors of the nearby College of New Jersey ( now Princeton University ) , as the second graduate theological school in the United States .
The Seminary remains an institution of the Presbyterian Church ( USA ) , being the largest of the ten theological seminaries affiliated with the 1.6-million - member denomination .
In 1812 , the seminary boasted three students and Archibald Alexander as its first professor .
By 1815 the number of students had gradually increased and work began on a building : Alexander Hall was designed by John McComb Jr. , a New York architect , and opened in 1817 .
The original cupola was added in 1827 , but it burned in 1913 and was replaced in 1926 .
The building was simply called " Seminary " until 1893 , when it was officially named Alexander Hall .
Since its founding , Princeton Seminary has graduated approximately 14,000 men and women who have served the church in many capacities , from pastoral ministry and pastoral care to missionary work , Christian education and leadership in the academy and business .
The seminary was made famous during the 19th and early 20th centuries for its defense of Calvinistic Presbyterianism , a tradition that became known as Princeton Theology and greatly influenced Evangelicalism during the period .
Some of the institution 's figures active in this movement included Charles Hodge , B.B. Warfield , J. Gresham Machen , and Geerhardus Vos .
In response to the increasing influence of theological liberalism in the 1920s and the Fundamentalist – Modernist Controversy at the institution , several theologians left to form the Westminster Theological Seminary under the leadership of J. Gresham Machen .
The college was later the center of the Fundamentalist – Modernist Controversy of the 1920s and 1930s .
In 1929 , the seminary was reorganized along modernist lines , and in response , Machen , along with three of his colleagues : Oswald T. Allis , Robert Dick Wilson and Cornelius Van Til , resigned , with Machen , Allis and Wilson founding Westminster Theological Seminary in Glenside , Pennsylvania .
In 1958 , Princeton became a seminary of the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. , following a merger between the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. and the United Presbyterian Church of North America , and in 1983 , it would become a seminary of the Presbyterian Church ( U.S.A. ) after the merger between the UPCUSA and the Presbyterian Church in the U.S. ACADEMICS Section::::Academics .
Princeton Theological Seminary has been accredited by the Commission on Accrediting of the Association of Theological Schools ( ATS ) since 1938 and by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education since 1968 .
