MOLISCH 'S TEST
Molisch 's test is a sensitive chemical test , named after Austrian botanist Hans Molisch , for the presence of carbohydrates , based on the dehydration of the carbohydrate by sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid to produce an aldehyde , which condenses with two molecules of a phenol ( usually α - naphthol , though other phenols such as resorcinol and thymol ) also give colored products ) , resulting in a red- or purple - coloured compound .
PROCEDURE Section::::Procedure .
The test solution is combined with a small amount of Molisch 's reagent ( α - naphthol dissolved in ethanol ) in a test tube .
After mixing , a small amount of concentrated sulfuric acid is slowly added down the sides of the sloping test - tube , without mixing , to form a layer .
A positive reaction is indicated by appearance of a purple red ring at the interface between the acid and test layers .
REACTION
Section::::Reaction .
All carbohydrates – monosaccharides , disaccharides , and polysaccharides – should give a positive reaction , and nucleic acids and glycoproteins also give a positive reaction , as all these compounds are eventually hydrolyzed to monosaccharides by strong mineral acids .
Pentoses are then dehydrated to furfural , while hexoses are dehydrated to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural .
Either of these aldehydes , if present , will condense with two molecules of α - naphthol to form a purple - colored product , as illustrated below by the example of glucose :
