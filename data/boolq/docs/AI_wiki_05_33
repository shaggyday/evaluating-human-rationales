LEV YASHIN
Lev Ivanovich Yashin ( , 22 October 1929 – 20 March 1990 ) , nicknamed the " Black Spider " or the " Black Panther " , was a Soviet professional footballer , considered by many as the greatest goalkeeper in the history of the sport .
He was known for his athleticism , positioning , stature , bravery , imposing presence in goal , and acrobatic reflex saves .
He was also deputy chairman of the Football Federation of the Soviet Union .
Yashin earned status for revolutionising the goalkeeping position by imposing his authority on the entire defence .
A vocal presence in goal , he shouted orders at his defenders , came off his line to intercept crosses and also ran out to meet onrushing attackers , done at a time when goalkeepers spent the 90 minutes standing in the goal waiting to be called into action .
His performances made an indelible impression on a global audience at the 1958 World Cup , the first to be broadcast internationally .
He dressed head to toe in apparent black ( in truth very dark blue ) , thus earning his nickname the ' Black Spider ' , which enhanced his popularity .
Yashin appeared in four World Cups from 1958 to 1970 , and in 2002 was chosen on the FIFA Dream Team of the history of World Cups .
In 1994 , he was chosen for the FIFA World Cup All - Time Team , and in 1998 was chosen as a member of the World Team of the 20th Century .
According to FIFA , Yashin saved over 150 penalty kicks in professional football – more than any other goalkeeper .
He also kept over 270 clean sheets in his career , winning a gold medal at the 1956 Olympic football tournament , and the 1960 European Championships .
In 1963 , Yashin received the Ballon d'Or , the only goalkeeper ever to receive the award .
He was voted the best goalkeeper of the 20th century by the IFFHS .
EARLY LIFE
Section::::Early life .
Yashin was born in Moscow to a family of industrial workers .
When he was 12 , World War II forced him to work in a factory to support the war effort .
However his health at the age of 18 ( after he suffered a nervous breakdown ) meant he was unable to work .
Thus , he was sent to work in a military factory in Moscow .
After being spotted playing for the factory team he was invited to join the Dynamo Moscow youth team .
CLUB CAREER Section::::Club career .
Yashin 's debut for Dynamo Moscow came in 1950 in a friendly match .
It was not the debut he would have hoped for , as he conceded a soft goal scored straight from a clearance by the opposing keeper .
That year he played in only two league games , and did not appear in a senior match again until 1953 .
But he remained determined , and stayed at Dynamo in the reserves waiting for another opportunity .
Yashin also played goalie for the Dynamo ice hockey team during those early years of trying to break into the senior squad .
He managed to win a USSR ice hockey cup in 1953 and was third in the USSR ice hockey championship as goalkeeper .
He spent his entire professional football career with Dynamo Moscow , from 1950 to 1970 , winning the USSR football championship five times and the Soviet Cup three times .
Yashin 's club teammate , rival and mentor was Alexei " Tiger " Khomich , the keeper of the Soviet national team , who had become famous for his role in Dynamo Moscow 's British tour .
He also internally rivaled goalkeeper Valter Sanaya , who left the club in 1953 .
INTERNATIONAL CAREER
Section::::International career .
In 1954 , Yashin was called up to the Soviet national team , and would go on to gather 78 caps .
With the national team he won the 1956 Summer Olympics as well as the first European championship , the 1960 European Nations ' Cup .
He also played in three World Cups , in 1958 , 1962 and 1966 .
Yashin is credited with four clean sheets out of the 12 games he played in the World Cup finals .
The 1958 World Cup , played in Sweden , put Yashin on the map for his performances , with the Soviet Union advancing to the quarter - finals .
In a group stage match against the eventual Cup winners Brazil , the Soviet team lost 2–0 .
Facing a Brazil team that featured Garrincha and a 17 year old Pelé in attack , Yashin 's performance prevented the score from becoming a rout .
Yashin was nominated for Ballon d'Or in 1960 and 1961 and placed fifth and fourth , respectively .
In 1962 , despite suffering two concussions during the tournament , he once again led the team to a quarter - final finish , before losing to host country Chile .
That tournament showed that Yashin was all too human , having made some uncharacteristic mistakes .
In the game against Colombia , which the Soviet Union was leading 4–1 , Yashin let in a few soft goals , including a goal scored by Marcos Coll directly from a corner kick ( the first and the only goal scored directly from a corner in FIFA World Cup history ) .
The game finished in a 4–4 tie , which led the French newspaper L'Équipe to predict the end of Yashin 's career .
He did , however , make an outstanding save against Chile in the quarter - final .
Despite this , the Soviet Union suffered a 2–1 defeat and were eliminated from the World Cup .
Despite the disappointment of the 1962 World Cup , Yashin would bounce back to win the Ballon d'Or in December 1963 .
One of his best performances that year was the 1963 England v Rest of the World football match , where he made a number of spectacular saves .
From that point onward he was known to the world as the " Black Spider " because he wore a distinctive all - black outfit and because it seemed as though he had eight arms to save almost everything .
But to his fans , he was always the fearless " Black Panther " .
He often played wearing a cloth cap of burnt - brick colour .
Yashin led the Soviet team to its best showing at the FIFA World Cup , a fourth - place finish in the 1966 World Cup held in England .
Always ready to give advice to his comrades , Yashin even made a fourth trip to the World Cup finals in 1970 , held in Mexico , as the third - choice back - up and an assistant coach .
The Soviet team again reached the quarter - finals .
In 1971 , in Moscow , he played his last match for Dynamo Moscow .
Lev Yashin 's FIFA testimonial match was held at the Lenin Stadium in Moscow with 100,000 fans attending and a host of football stars , including Pelé , Eusébio and Franz Beckenbauer .
POST - PLAYING CAREER Section::::Post - playing career .
After retiring from playing , Yashin spent almost 20 years in various administrative positions at Dynamo Moscow .
A bronze statue of Lev Yashin was erected at the Dynamo Stadium in Moscow .
In 1986 , following a thrombophlebitis contracted while he was in Budapest , Yashin underwent the amputation of one of his legs .
He died in 1990 of stomach cancer , despite a surgical intervention in an attempt to save his life .
He was given a state funeral as a Soviet Honoured Master of Sport .
Yashin was survived by wife Valentina Timofeyevna and daughters Irina and Elena ; when Russia hosted the 2018 FIFA World Cup , Valentina was still living in the Moscow apartment that the Soviet state had given her husband in 1964 .
Yashin has one granddaughter and one surviving grandson ; another grandson died in 2002 at age 14 from injuries suffered in a bicycle accident .
The surviving grandson , Vasili Frolov , played as a goalkeeper in Dynamo 's youth section and was on the books of the senior side , but never played a game with the senior side , retiring from play at age 23 .
He now runs a goalkeeper training school in Moscow near Spartak Moscow 's current stadium .
STYLE OF PLAY AND ACCOLADES Section::::Style of play and accolades .
Considered by many in the sport to be the greatest goalkeeper in the history of the game , Yashin was an imposing presence in goal due to his tall stature , and was highly regarded for his athleticism , positional sense , bravery , and exceptional reflexes , which enabled him to produce acrobatic and spectacular saves .
Yashin remains the only goalkeeper to have won the Ballon d'Or , in 1963 .
He also stopped 151 penalty kicks during his career , more than any other goalkeeper in the history of the sport , and kept over 270 clean sheets .
For his outstanding service to the people and to his country , Yashin was awarded the Order of Lenin in 1967 , the highest award of the USSR .
A vocal and authoritative figure between the posts , Yashin is known for revolutionizing the goalkeeping position : he shouted orders at his defenders , came off his line to intercept crosses , and also ran out to meet onrushing attackers , done at a time when goalkeepers spent the 90 minutes standing in the goal waiting to be called into action .
Yashin would always organise the defensive game of his team , often so fiercely that even his wife accused him of yelling too much on the pitch .
He rarely captained his teams , as the later accepted custom of appointing a goalkeeper captain was virtually unheard - of in that era , but his leadership on the field was always evident .
Yashin was one of the goalkeepers who began the practice of punching balls out in difficult situations instead of trying to catch them .
Other novel practices he developed were the quick throw of the ball to begin a counterattack , coming out of the penalty area to anticipate danger , and the command and organisation of the defenders – practices now quite common among goalkeepers .
When asked what his secret was , he would reply that the trick was " to have a smoke to calm your nerves , then toss back a strong drink to tone your muscles . "
In 1994 , FIFA established the Lev Yashin Award for the best goalkeeper at the World Cup finals .
FIFA polls named Yashin as the sole goalkeeper in World Team of the 20th Century .
World Soccer magazine named him in their 100 Greatest Players of the 20th century .
Many commentators consider Yashin the best goalkeeper in the history of football , which has resulted in him being chosen to be the goalkeeper in most of the world - all - time teams ( including the FIFA World Cup
All - Time Team and the FIFA Dream Team ) .
