CRITICISM
OVER INACCURACIES Section::::Criticism over inaccuracies .
The film has been criticized for allegedly not being true to the details of his life and career and for inventing incidents and rearranging locations , such as Petey 's appearance on The Tonight Show , which never actually took place .
Greene 's surviving family members did not cooperate with the making of the film and criticized it for taking liberties with his portrayal and those around him , such as showing Dewey Hughes giving a moving eulogy at Petey 's wake , when in reality Hughes did not even attend the funeral .
In response to these criticisms , producer Joe Fries responded that the film was merely " inspired by " Greene and not a factual recounting of his life .
