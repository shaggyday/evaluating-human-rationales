MINUTES Minutes , also known as minutes of meeting ( abbreviation MoM ) , protocols or , informally , notes , are the instant written record of a meeting or hearing .
They typically describe the events of the meeting and may include a list of attendees , a statement of the issues considered by the participants , and related responses or decisions for the issues .
CREATION Section::::Creation .
Minutes may be created during the meeting by a typist or court reporter , who may use shorthand notation and then prepare the minutes and issue them to the participants afterwards .
Alternatively , the meeting can be audio recorded , video recorded , or a group 's appointed or informally assigned secretary may take notes , with minutes prepared PURPOSE Section::::Purpose .
Minutes are the official written record of the meetings of an organization or group .
They are not transcripts of those proceedings .
Using Robert 's Rules of Order
Newly Revised ( RONR ) , the minutes should contain mainly a record of what was done at the meeting , not what was said by the members .
The organization may have its own rules regarding the content of the minutes .
For most organizations or groups , it is important for the minutes to be terse and only include a summary of the decisions .
A verbatim report ( transcript ) is typically not useful .
Unless the organization 's rules require it , a summary of the discussions in a meeting is neither necessary nor appropriate .
The minutes of certain groups , such as a corporate board of directors , must be kept on file and are important legal documents .
Minutes from board meetings are kept separately from minutes of general membership meetings within the same organization .
Also , minutes of executive sessions may be kept separately .
Committees are not required to keep formal minutes although less formal notes may be taken .
For committees , their formal records are the reports submitted to their parent body .
FORMAT Section::::Format .
The format of the minutes can vary depending on the standards established by an organization , although there are general guidelines .
Robert 's Rules of Order
Newly Revised contains a sample set of minutes .
Generally , minutes begin with the name of the body holding the meeting ( e.g. , a board ) and may also include the place , date , list of people present , and the time that the chair called the meeting to order .
Since the primary function of minutes is to record the decisions made , all official decisions must be included .
If a formal motion is proposed and seconded , then ( regardless whether it passes ) this is recorded .
The voting tally may also be included .
The part of the minutes dealing with a routine motion might note merely that a particular motion was " moved by Ann and passed " .
It is not strictly necessary to include the name of the person who seconds a motion .
Where a tally is included , it is sufficient to record the number of people voting for and against a motion , but requests by participants to note their votes by name may be allowed .
If a decision is made by roll - call vote , then all of the individual votes are recorded by name .
If it is made by general consent without a formal vote , then this fact may be recorded .
The minutes may end with a note of the time that the meeting was adjourned .
Minutes are sometimes submitted by the person who is responsible for them ( often the secretary ) at a subsequent meeting for review .
The traditional closing phrase is " Respectfully submitted " ( although this is no longer common ) , followed by the officer 's signature , his or her typed ( or printed ) name , and his or her title .
Usually , one of the first items in an order of business or an agenda for a meeting is the reading and approval of the minutes from the previous meeting .
If the members of the group agree ( usually by unanimous consent ) that the written minutes reflect what happened at the previous meeting , then they are approved , and the fact of their approval is recorded in the minutes of the current meeting .
If there are significant errors or omissions , then the minutes may be redrafted and submitted again at a later date .
Minor changes may be made immediately using the normal amendment procedures , and the amended minutes may be approved " as amended " .
It is normally appropriate to send a draft copy of the minutes to all the members in advance of the meeting so that the meeting is not delayed by a reading of the draft .
