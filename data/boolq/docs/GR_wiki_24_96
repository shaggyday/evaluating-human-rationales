NORTHERN
IRELAND AT THE FIFA WORLD CUP The Northern Ireland national football team have appeared in the finals of the FIFA World Cup on three occasions .
Their best World Cup performance was in their first appearance in the finals , the 1958 World Cup , where they reached the quarter - finals after beating Czechoslovakia 2–1 in the play - off .
They were knocked out by France , losing 4–0 .
In the 1958 competition Northern Ireland became the least populous country to have qualified for the World Cup , a record that stood until Trinidad & Tobago qualified for the 2006 World Cup .
Northern Ireland remains , however , the least populous country to have qualified for more than one World Cup finals tournament , to win a World Cup finals match , to have scored at a World Cup finals , and to have progressed from the first round of the World Cup finals .
Captain of the national side at the 1958 World Cup was Danny Blanchflower , who also captained Tottenham Hotspur in the English league and was twice footballer of the year in England .
His younger brother Jackie was also a key member of the national team , and won two league titles in England with Manchester United , until his career was ended by injuries suffered in the Munich air disaster of February 1958 .
Despite the presence of world class forward George Best , another Manchester United player , for most of the 1960s and into the 1970s , Northern Ireland failed to qualify for any major tournaments during this time .
Northern Ireland also qualified for the 1982 World Cup .
Their opening game was against Yugoslavia at the La Romareda in Zaragoza .
It was the international debut of 17-year - old Norman Whiteside who became the youngest player ever in the World Cup finals , a record that still stands .
The game finished goalless .
Five days later they drew 1–1 with Honduras , which was a disappointment , and many believed had doomed Northern Ireland 's chances of advancing in the competition .
They needed a win against hosts Spain in the third and final group game at the Mestalla Stadium in Valencia .
They faced a partisan atmosphere with a mostly Spanish crowd and a Spanish speaking referee in Héctor Ortiz who was unwilling to punish dirty play from the Spanish players .
However a mistake from goalkeeper Luis Arconada gifted Gerry Armstrong the only goal of the game , and despite having Mal Donaghy sent off on 60 minutes , Northern Ireland went on to record an historic 1–0 win and top the first stage group .
A 2–2 draw with Austria at the Vicente Calderón Stadium meant that a win against France would take them into the semi - finals , however a French team inspired by Michel Platini won 4–1 and eliminated Northern Ireland from the competition .
In the 1986 World Cup , they reached the first round .
Billy Bingham , a member of the 1958 squad , was manager for both of these tournaments .
They have qualified for the 2018 World Cup playoffs .
