3 - 1 - 1 3 - 1 - 1 is a special telephone number supported in many communities in Canada and the United States .
The number provides access to non - emergency municipal services .
The number format follows the N11 code for a group of short , special - purpose local numbers as designated in the North American Numbering Plan .
3 - 1 - 1 creates a central hub for constituents to be able to access a variety of city services .
The number 3 - 1 - 1 is intended in part to divert routine inquiries and non - urgent community concerns from the 9 - 1 - 1 number which is reserved for emergency service .
A promotional website for 3 - 1 - 1 in Akron described the distinction as follows : " Burning building ?
Call 9 - 1 - 1 .
Burning question ?
Call 3 - 1 - 1 . "
Many cities also accept 3 - 1 - 1 comments through online interfaces .
An Open 311 application programming interface is also available for these services .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The first use of 3 - 1 - 1 for informational services was in Baltimore , Maryland , where the service commenced on 2 October 1996 .
3 - 1 - 1 is intended to connect callers to a call center that can be the same as the 9 - 1 - 1 call center , but with 3 - 1 - 1 calls assigned a secondary priority , answered only when no 9 - 1 - 1 calls are waiting .
This system is intended to extend the system such that true emergency callers are answered quickly with highest priority .
The largest 3 - 1 - 1 operation in North America operates in New York City , which was implemented in 2003 .
The Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) reserved the use of 3 - 1 - 1 for non - emergency municipal services throughout Canada on 5 November 2004 .
The first Canadian 3 - 1 - 1 service opened in Calgary , Alberta on 18 May 2005 .
Historically , the 311 code was used by some telephone companies for testing purposes .
In Alberta , 311 was the automatic number announcement circuit ( ANAC ) until 1 April 2005 when this was changed to 958 - 6111 to make way for the 3 - 1 - 1 service .

Section::::Finland .
On a yearly basis , the dispatchers in Finland 's 112 service receive some 800,000 non - urgent calls .
In order to curb this problem , which ties up precious resources , a committee proposes that Finland launch a new telephone number—116 115—for such calls .
Calls to this number would also be free of charge .
GERMANY

In Germany , 115 is a single access number to communal , regional and federal administrations .

USAGE Section::::Usage .
The cost of city services in Baltimore has been dramatically reduced by the combination of the 3 - 1 - 1 service and CitiStat .
While Baltimore was the first city to use 311 as a police non - emergency number , in January 1999 , Chicago initiated the first comprehensive 3 - 1 - 1 system , by providing information and tracking city services from intake to resolution , in addition to taking non - emergency police calls .
When the new service was launched , information regarding all city services , service requests , assistance in reaching various city departments and public offices , and a variety of information ranging from information about the city 's Blue Bag recycling program to special events schedules could be obtained by calling 3 - 1 - 1 .
This also supplanted the need to remember or find the number ( 312 ) 744 - 5000 , which , until then , acted as a switching station for reaching various city departments and employees , as well as Chicago Police non - emergency ( dialing this number today directs you to a 3 - 1 - 1 center operator from any area code ) .
Since its launch , Chicago 3 - 1 - 1 has won numerous national awards , including the Innovations in American Government Award from the Ash Institute for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard University 's John F. Kennedy School of Government in 2003 .
In addition to providing seamless delivery of city services to residents , the call center serves as a backup to the City 's 911 call center .
In Orange County , Florida , in 2004 , while the 3 - 1 - 1 system was still being piloted , three hurricanes struck Central Florida .
The unusual occurrence damaged homes and businesses throughout the Orlando area .
The pilot program used a seven - digit number ( initially 836 - 3111 ) and it was this number that received the demands for post - hurricane services .
This experience tested and proved the value of the program and Orange County immediately activated the 3 - 1 - 1 number for governmental customer service .
In New York City , 3 - 1 - 1 is used by city officials as one of several sources of measurement and information about the performance of city services .
Important dates in the history of New York 's 3 - 1 - 1 service include December 20 , 2005 , when it received its record high of 240,000 calls , due to the first day of the 2005 New York City transit strike , and June 20 , 2007 , when it received its 50 millionth call .
In San Francisco , 3 - 1 - 1 is the number for the City and County of San Francisco .
As in New York City , it provides information about city services , such as transit information .
San Francisco 3 - 1 - 1 was implemented in 2007 shortly after the launch of the T Third Street Muni light rail line .
However , it has come under substantial criticism of late because the 3 - 1 - 1 system charges the financially strapped Muni system $ 1.96 for every Muni - related phone call .
Some have criticized Mayor Gavin Newsom for stealing Muni funds into the 3 - 1 - 1 system .
In the city of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County , North Carolina , 3 - 1 - 1 is also used to find lost pets , get answers to questions about taxes , complain about needed roadway maintenance , get information about flood conditions , make non - emergency police reports , and other government services .
The City of Philadelphia implemented its 3 - 1 - 1 service in 2008 .
The Philly311 Contact Center provides information to citizens and places service requests for departments across the city .
These requests include but are not limited to : missed rubbish collection , graffiti removal , License & Inspection inquiries , and pothole repairs .
Philly311
receives over one million calls each year despite not being in service on a 24/7 basis , as is the case in other cities .
