CREAMED COCONUT
Creamed coconut ( also known as coconut cream concentrate or coconut butter ) is a coconut product .
It is the unsweetened dehydrated fresh pulp of a mature coconut , ground to a semi - solid white creamy paste .
It is sold in the form of a hard white block which can be stored at room temperature .
( Coconut oil melts at around 24 Â° C , so in warmer weather it is a liquid paste . )
The block is generally packaged in a sealed plastic pouch and some separation of the pure fat and the coconut flesh can be seen .
In cookery , it is chopped into pieces or grated before it is added to dishes .
By adding warm water it can be made into coconut milk or coconut cream .
Adding water to creamed coconut in the ratio 5:2 gives coconut cream , 5:1 coconut milk .
Creamed coconut is added to Indian , South East Asian and Caribbean recipes to enrich curries and sauces .
In the west , it is primarily used in confectionery items , desserts , ice cream , and sauces .
Not to be confused with the related coconut cream , which is a liquid .
Creamed coconut does not contain cholesterol and is a source of fiber .
It is also a good source of potassium .
