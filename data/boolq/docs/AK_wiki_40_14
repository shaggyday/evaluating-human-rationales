COMMON COLD
The common cold , also known simply as a cold , is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the nose .
The throat , sinuses , and larynx may also be affected .
Signs and symptoms may appear less than two days after exposure to the virus .
These may include coughing , sore throat , runny nose , sneezing , headache , and fever .
People usually recover in seven to ten days , but some symptoms may last up to three weeks .
Occasionally those with other health problems may develop pneumonia .
Well over 200 virus strains are implicated in causing the common cold , with rhinoviruses being the most common .
They spread through the air during close contact with infected people or indirectly through contact with objects in the environment , followed by transfer to the mouth or nose .
Risk factors include going to child care facilities , not sleeping well , and psychological stress .
The symptoms are mostly due to the body 's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves .
In contrast , those affected by influenza can show similar symptoms as people with a cold , but symptoms are usually more severe .
Additionally , influenza is less likely to result in a runny nose .
There is no vaccine for the common cold .
The primary methods of prevention are hand washing ; not touching the eyes , nose or mouth with unwashed hands ; and staying away from sick people .
Some evidence supports the use of face masks .
There is also no cure , but the symptoms can be treated .
Zinc may reduce the duration and severity of symptoms if started shortly after the onset of symptoms .
Nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) such as ibuprofen may help with pain .
Antibiotics , however , should not be used and there is no good evidence for cough medicines .
The common cold is the most frequent infectious disease in humans .
The average adult gets two to three colds a year , while the average child may get six to eight .
Infections occur more commonly during the winter .
These infections have existed throughout human history .
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Section::::Signs and symptoms .
The typical symptoms of a cold include a cough , a runny nose , nasal congestion and a sore throat , sometimes accompanied by muscle ache , fatigue , headache , and loss of appetite .
A sore throat is present in about 40 % of cases and a cough in about 50 % , while muscle ache occurs in about half .
In adults , a fever is generally not present but it is common in infants and young children .
The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza .
While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults , a great deal of similarity exists between these two conditions .
A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections .
The color of the sputum or nasal secretion may vary from clear to yellow to green and does not indicate the class of agent causing the infection .
PROGRESSION Section::::Progression .
A cold usually begins with fatigue , a feeling of being chilled , sneezing , and a headache , followed in a couple of days by a runny nose and cough .
Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset .
They usually resolve in seven to ten days , but some can last for up to three weeks .
The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post - viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone .
In children , the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40 % of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10 % .
CAUSE VIRUSES Section::::Cause .
Section::::Viruses .
The common cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract .
The most commonly implicated virus is a rhinovirus ( 30–80 % ) , a type of picornavirus with 99 known serotypes .
Other commonly implicated viruses include human coronavirus ( ≈ 15%),influenza viruses ( 10–15 % ) , adenoviruses ( 5 % ) , human respiratory syncytial virus , enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses , human parainfluenza viruses , and metapneumovirus .
Frequently more than one virus is present .
In total over 200 viral types are associated with colds .
TRANSMISSION Section::::Transmission .
The common cold virus is typically transmitted via airborne droplets ( aerosols ) , direct contact with infected nasal secretions , or fomites ( contaminated objects ) .
Which of these routes is of primary importance has not been determined .
The viruses may survive for prolonged periods in the environment ( over 18 hours for rhinoviruses ) and can be picked up by people 's hands and subsequently carried to their eyes or nose where infection occurs .
Transmission is common in daycare and at school due to the proximity of many children with little immunity and frequently poor hygiene .
These infections are then brought home to other members of the family .
There is no evidence that recirculated air during commercial flight is a method of transmission .
People sitting in close proximity appear to be at greater risk of infection .
Rhinovirus - caused colds are most infectious during the first three days of symptoms ; they are much less infectious afterwards .
WEATHER Section::::Weather .
The traditional theory is that a cold can be " caught " by prolonged exposure to cold weather such as rain or winter conditions , which is how the disease got its name .
Some of the viruses that cause the common colds are seasonal , occurring more frequently during cold or wet weather .
The reason for the seasonality has not been conclusively determined .
Possible explanations may include cold temperature - induced changes in the respiratory system , decreased immune response , and low humidity causing an increase in viral transmission rates , perhaps due to dry air allowing small viral droplets to disperse farther and stay in the air longer .
The apparent seasonality may also be due to social factors , such as people spending more time indoors , near infected people , and specifically children at school .
There is some controversy over the role of low body temperature as a risk factor for the common cold ; the majority of the evidence suggests that it may result in greater susceptibility to infection .
OTHER Section::::Other .
Herd immunity , generated from previous exposure to cold viruses , plays an important role in limiting viral spread , as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections .
Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease .
Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure ; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function .
Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases , and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold .
In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself .
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Section::::Pathophysiology .
The symptoms of the common cold are believed to be primarily related to the immune response to the virus .
The mechanism of this immune response is virus specific .
For example , the rhinovirus is typically acquired by direct contact ; it binds to human via ICAM-1 receptors and the CDHR3 receptor through unknown mechanisms to trigger the release of inflammatory mediators .
These inflammatory mediators then produce the symptoms .
It does not generally cause damage to the nasal epithelium .
The respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) , on the other hand , is contracted by direct contact and airborne droplets .
It then replicates in the nose and throat before frequently spreading to the lower respiratory tract .
RSV does cause epithelium damage .
Human parainfluenza virus typically results in inflammation of the nose , throat , and bronchi .
In young children when it affects the trachea it may produce the symptoms of croup due to the small size of their airways .
DIAGNOSIS Section::::Diagnosis .
The distinction between viral upper respiratory tract infections is loosely based on the location of symptoms with the common cold affecting primarily the nose , pharyngitis ( the throat ) , and bronchitis ( the lungs ) .
However , there can be significant overlap and multiple areas can be affected .
The common cold is frequently defined as nasal inflammation with varying amount of throat inflammation .
Self - diagnosis is frequent .
Isolation of the viral agent involved is rarely performed , and it is generally not possible to identify the virus type through symptoms .
PREVENTION Section::::Prevention .
The only useful ways to reduce the spread of cold viruses are physical measures such as hand washing and face masks ; in the healthcare environment , gowns and disposable gloves are also used .
Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non - specific .
Vaccination has proved difficult as there are many viruses involved and they mutate rapidly .
Creation of a broadly effective vaccine is , thus , highly improbable .
Regular hand washing appears to be effective in reducing the transmission of cold viruses , especially among children .
Whether the addition of antivirals or antibacterials to normal hand washing provides greater benefit is unknown .
Wearing face masks when around people who are infected may be beneficial ; however , there is insufficient evidence for maintaining a greater social distance .
It is unclear if zinc supplements affect the likelihood of contracting a cold .
Routine vitamin C supplements do not reduce the risk or severity of the common cold , though they may reduce its duration .
Gargling with water was found useful in one small trial .
MANAGEMENT Section::::Management . Treatment for the common cold primarily involves medications and other therapies for symptomatic relief .
Getting plenty of rest , drinking fluids to maintain hydration , and gargling with warm salt water are reasonable conservative measures .
Much of the benefit from symptomatic treatment is , however , attributed to the placebo effect .
No medications or herbal remedies have been conclusively demonstrated to shorten the duration of infection .
SYMPTOMATIC
Section::::Symptomatic .
Treatments that may help with symptoms include simple pain medication and medications for fevers such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen ( paracetamol ) .
It , however , is not clear if acetaminophen helps with symptoms .
It is not known if over the counter cough medications are effective for treating an acute cough .
Cough medicines are not recommended for use in children due to a lack of evidence supporting effectiveness and the potential for harm .
In 2009 , Canada restricted the use of over - the - counter cough and cold medication in children six years and under due to concerns regarding risks and unproven benefits .
The misuse of dextromethorphan ( an over - the - counter cough medicine ) has led to its ban in a number of countries .
Intranasal corticosteroids have not been found to be useful .
In adults short term use of nasal decongestants may have a small benefit .
Antihistamines may improve symptoms in the first day or two ; however , there is no longer - term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness .
Other decongestants such as pseudoephedrine appear effective in adults .
Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but has little effect on stuffiness .
The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear .
Due to lack of studies , it is not known whether increased fluid intake improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illness .
As of 2017 it is unclear if heated and humidified air via the RhinoTherm device was of any benefit .
One study has found chest vapor rub to provide some relief of nocturnal cough , congestion , and sleep difficulty .
Some advise to avoid physical exercise if there are symptoms such as fever , widespread muscle aches or fatigue .
It is regarded as safe to perform moderate exercise if the symptoms are confined to the head , including runny nose , nasal congestion , sneezing , or a minor sore throat .
ANTIBIOTICS AND ANTIVIRALS Section::::Antibiotics and antivirals .
Antibiotics have no effect against viral infections or against the viruses that cause the common cold .
Due to their side effects , antibiotics cause overall harm but are still frequently prescribed .
Some of the reasons that antibiotics are so commonly prescribed include people 's expectations for them , physicians ' desire to help , and the difficulty in excluding complications that may be amenable to antibiotics .
There are no effective antiviral drugs for the common cold even though some preliminary research has shown benefits .
ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Section::::Alternative medicine .
While there are many alternative treatments used for the common cold , there is insufficient scientific evidence to support the use of most .
As of 2018 there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against honey .
As of 2015 , there is tentative evidence to support nasal irrigation .
Zinc supplements may shorten the duration and reduce the severity of symptoms if supplementation begins within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms .
Some zinc remedies directly applied to the inside of the nose have led to the loss of the sense of smell .
A 2017 expert panel , however , found the evidence to be insufficient to recommend zinc 's use .
Vitamin C 's effect on the common cold , while extensively researched , is disappointing , except in limited circumstances : specifically , individuals exercising vigorously in cold environments .
There is no firm evidence that Echinacea products provide any meaningful benefit in treating or preventing colds .
It is unknown if garlic is effective .
A single trial of vitamin D did not find benefit .
PROGNOSIS Section::::Prognosis .
The common cold is generally mild and self - limiting with most symptoms generally improving in a week .
Half of cases go away in 10 days and 90 % in 15 days .
Severe complications , if they occur , are usually in the very old , the very young , or those who are immunosuppressed .
Secondary bacterial infections may occur resulting in sinusitis , pharyngitis , or an ear infection .
It is estimated that sinusitis occurs in 8 % and ear infection in 30 % of cases .
EPIDEMIOLOGY Section::::Epidemiology .
The common cold is the most common human disease and affects people all over the globe .
Adults typically have two to three infections annually , and children may have six to ten colds a year ( and up to twelve colds a year for school children ) .
Rates of symptomatic infections increase in the elderly due to declining immunity .
Native Americans and Inuit are more likely to be infected with colds and develop complications such as otitis media than Caucasians .
This may be explained by issues such as poverty and overcrowding rather than by ethnicity .
HISTORY Section::::History .
While the cause of the common cold has only been identified since the 1950s , the disease has been with humanity throughout history .
Its symptoms and treatment are described in the Egyptian Ebers papyrus , the oldest existing medical text , written before the 16th century BCE .
The name " cold " came into use in the 16th century , due to the similarity between its symptoms and those of exposure to cold weather .
In the United Kingdom , the Common Cold Unit was set up by the Medical Research Council in 1946 and
it was where the rhinovirus was discovered in 1956 .
In the 1970s , the CCU demonstrated that treatment with interferon during the incubation phase of rhinovirus infection protects somewhat against the disease , but no practical treatment could be developed .
The unit was closed in 1989 , two years after it completed research of zinc gluconate lozenges in the prophylaxis and treatment of rhinovirus colds , the only successful treatment in the history of the unit .
SOCIETY AND CULTURE Section::::Society and culture .
The economic impact of the common cold is not well understood in much of the world .
In the United States , the common cold leads to 75–100 million physician visits annually at a conservative cost estimate of $ 7.7 billion per year .
Americans spend $ 2.9 billion on over - the - counter drugs and another $ 400 million on prescription medicines for symptom relief .
More than one - third of people who saw a doctor received an antibiotic prescription , which has implications for antibiotic resistance .
An estimated 22–189 million school days are missed annually due to a cold .
As a result , parents missed 126 million workdays to stay home to care for their children .
When added to the 150 million workdays missed by employees suffering from a cold , the total economic impact of cold - related work loss exceeds $ 20 billion per year .
This accounts for 40 % of time lost from work in the United States .
RESEARCH DIRECTIONS Section::::Research directions .
Antivirals have been tested for effectiveness in the common cold ; as of 2009 , none had been both found effective and licensed for use .
There are ongoing trials of the anti - viral drug pleconaril which shows promise against picornaviruses as well as trials of BTA-798 .
The oral form of pleconaril had safety issues and an aerosol form is being studied .
DRACO , a broad - spectrum antiviral therapy , has shown preliminary effectiveness in treating rhinovirus , as well as other infectious viruses .
The genomes for all known human rhinovirus strains have been sequenced .
