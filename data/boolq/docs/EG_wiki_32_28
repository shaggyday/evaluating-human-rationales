LIST OF VOLCANOES IN AUSTRALIA
This is a list of active , dormant and extinct volcanoes in Australia and its island territories .
Note that the term volcano is used loosely as it can include groups of related volcanoes and vents that erupted at similar times with lava of related origin .
The lists provided below are mainly volcanoes of Cenozoic aged , with some notable older ( Mesozoic and Paleozoic aged ) volcanoes included .
There are no volcanoes on the Australian mainland that have erupted since European settlement , but some volcanoes in Victoria , South Australia , and North Queensland were witnessed by Aboriginal people several thousand years ago .
There are active volcanoes in the Heard and McDonald Islands .

â€” WESTERN AUSTRALIA Section::::Western Australia .
There are no active or dormant volcanoes in Western Australia , although there are a number of extinct ones , and geological evidence of others .
There are nineteen small extinct volcanoes in the valley of the Fitzroy River in the Kimberley region of Western Australia .
The Kimberley also has a number of groups of hot springs , which may be connected with the volcanic activity that produced the extinct volcanoes ( but since these volcanic formations are Proterozoic in age - i.e. maybe a billion years old , this would be very unlikely ! ) .
There are also deposits of basalt at Bunbury and Cape Gosselin .
