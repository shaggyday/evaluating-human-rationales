CHEVROLET SILVERADO
The Chevrolet Silverado , and its mechanically identical cousin the GMC Sierra , are a series of full - size and heavy - duty pickup trucks manufactured by General Motors and introduced in 1998 as the successor to the long - running Chevrolet C / K line .
The Silverado name was taken from a trim level previously used on its predecessor , the Chevrolet C / K pickup truck from 1975 through 1998 .
General Motors continues to offer a GMC - badged variant of the Chevrolet full - size pickup under the GMC Sierra name , first used in 1987 for its variant of the GMT400 platform trucks .
The heavy - duty trucks are informally referred to as " Silverado HD " ( and Sierra HD ) , while the light - duty version is referred simply to as " Silverado " ( and Sierra ) .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Although General Motors introduced its first pickup truck in 1930 , the term " Silverado " was a designation used only to detail the trim for the Chevrolet C / K pickup trucks , Suburbans , and Tahoes from 1975 through 1999 .
GMC used a few variations of the " Sierra " name ( e.g. Sierra , Sierra Classic , and High Sierra ) ; however , Chevrolet still uses the CK and the CC in their current model codes .
The Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks have been essentially the same for their entire history .
However , there are some trim and add - on option variations .
Early models included variations in the engine and equipment , but the present differences are slight .
The 1999 model year redesign included different grilles and interior trim , and certain features ( e.g. Quadrasteer ) were included at different times on the two trucks .
The GMC Sierra has a luxury package known as " Denali " which adds additional creature comfort features and design changes .
Chevrolet 's equivalent to the Denali trim level is the High Country Silverado which was introduced in the 2014 model year .
In 2018 , at the Work Truck Show , another new Silverado will be released , being the 4500 and 5500 ; these vehicles will be exclusive to Chevrolet , as GMC has no plans to offer an equivalent .
GM webpage FIRST GENERATION ( 1999–2007 )
Section::::First generation ( 1999–2007 ) .
The GMT800 Silverado / Sierra 1500 and 2500 ( non Heavy Duty ) ( light pickup trucks ) were released in August 1998 as 1999 models .
The " classic " light - duty GMT400 C / K trucks were continued in production for that first year alongside the new models , and the Heavy - Duty GMT400 pickups ( alongside the GMT400 SUVs ) were continued until 2000 , with the new GMT800 Silverado / Sierra HD ( Heavy Duty ) released a year later .
A small refresh for 2003 models was introduced in 2002 , bringing slight design changes and an upgrade to the audio and HVAC controls .
The latter 2006 and 2007 GMT800 production units used the name Classic to denote the difference between the first and second generation trucks .
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Development .
In January 1993 , GM began development on the GMT800 pickup program with numerous teams coming together .
By the end of 1994 , a final design was chosen and finalized for production in June 1995 at 36 months ahead of scheduled start in June 1998 .
Development sign - off was issued in late 1997 , with pre - production and series production commencement in June 1998 .
LIGHT DUTY
Section::::Light duty .
There are a number of models of light - duty Silverados and Sierras , including the half - ton , SS , and Hybrid .
The light - duty trucks use the 1500 name .
They are available in three cab lengths , 2-door standard / regular cab , 4-door extended cab , and front - hinged 4-door crew cab .
Three cargo beds are available : a short box , standard box , and a long box .
The short box is only available with the crew cab .
For the first year , only the regular cab and an extended cab were available , along with the Vortec 4300 V6 , Vortec 4800 V8 , and the Vortec 5300 V8 .
In 2000 , a driver 's side door option became available for the extended cab , giving it four doors , and the crew - cab body was added to the lineup in 2004 .
Output on the 5.3 L engine also increased to and .
The 6.0 L Vortec 6000 V8 was standard on the 2500 and was added for the 2001 Heavy Duty models , rated at , with the GMC Sierra 1500 C3 getting an uprated version of this engine .
The Silverado Z71 got an optional lighter composite box , with a suspension package for towing , but lacked the high - output engine .
The C3 became the Denali for 2002 , and Quadrasteer was added .
GM introduced a reworked version of the Silverado and Sierra in 2003 , with a new front end and a slightly updated rear end .
In 2006 the Silverado received another facelift , similar to the HD version introduced in 2005 HD models .
In addition to that , Chevrolet has deleted the " Chevrolet " badge off the tailgate that was used from 1998 - 2005 .
Its SUV counterparts retained the use of the pre - facelift sheetmetal .
During the 2005 model year , all light duty GMT800 pickups reverted to front disc / rear drum brakes as a cost cutting measure ; heavy duty trucks and the SUVs retained their 4-wheel disc brakes .
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety ( IIHS ) gave the Silverado an overall " marginal " score on the frontal offset crash test for poor structural integrity and poor dummy control , although no injuries were recorded on the dummy 's body regions .
2001
GMC SIERRA C3 / DENALI
Section::::2001
GMC Sierra C3 / Denali .
GMC created an upscale version of its Sierra 1500 in 2001 called the Sierra C3 .
It used all - wheel drive with a 3.73 final drive gear ratio and included the 6.0 L Vortec 6000 LQ4 V8 rated at at 5000 rpm and
370 lb•ft ( 502 N·m ) of torque at 4000 rpm coupled to a 4L60E - HD four - speed automatic transmission along with other upscale equipment .
For 2002 , the name was changed to Sierra Denali , but the specifications remained essentially the same except for the addition of Quadrasteer and GM changed from the 4L60E - HD to the 4L65E in conjunction with a 4.10 final drive gear ratio .
The Denali is rated for towing and hauling in the cargo box .
The Sierra Denali was initially equipped with Delphi 's Quadrasteer system as standard equipment .
It was a 4-wheel steering system that greatly reduced the truck 's turning radius and improved lane changing while towing .
General Motors dropped Quadrasteer from the Sierra Denali after the 2004 model year and its entire lineup after 2005 due to poor sales of this expensive option .
CHEVROLET SILVERADO SS Section::::Chevrolet Silverado SS .
Launched in early 2003 , the Silverado SS is a high - performance pickup truck built by Chevrolet .
It is based on the 1500 Silverado Extended Cab with Fleetside Box and features upgrades in the drive train and both exterior and interior appearance .
It was equipped standard with the 6.0 liter Vortec High - Output V8 rated at at 5200 rpm and of torque at 4000 rpm coupled to a 4L65E four - speed automatic transmission .
This was the same engine used for the second generation Cadillac Escalade .
Chevrolet and GMC advertised this engine as the Vortec High Output and later as the " VortecMAX " , while Cadillac calls it the " HO 6000 " .
The SS debuted in 2003 with a standard All Wheel Drive setup with a 4.10 final drive gear ratio and 4 wheel disc brakes .
In 2005 , in an attempt to increase sales , a 2-wheel drive version became available ( the 2WD SS also lost its rear disc brakes in favor of drums , as did the rest of the 1/2-ton GMT800s ) .
2005 was also the first year the sunroof was available in the SS line up .
In 2006 , the AWD variant was dropped and the rear wheel drive was the only driveline layout available .
In a further effort to reduce cost , you could also get cloth interior and/or a bench seat .
The Silverado SS also comes with the Z60 performance suspension and 20 inch aluminum wheels .
All the SS trucks in both 2 wheel drive and AWD used the torsion bar style front suspension for better handling .
SS themed trucks were only available from the factory in Black Onyx , Victory Red , and Arrival Blue Metallic from 2003 to 2004 .
In 2005 Arrival Blue Metallic was dropped from the color choices and replaced with Silver Birch Metallic .
INTIMIDATOR SS Section::::Intimidator SS .
In 2006 , Chevrolet released a special edition Silverado SS under the name " Intimidator SS " ( licensed by Dale Earnhardt , Inc. ) to honor the late Dale Earnhardt .
The truck came with several minor appearance upgrades ( rear spoiler , embroidered headrests , Intimidator custom badging ) , but was essentially just a regular Silverado SS .
Of the 1,033 scheduled trucks , only 933 were made ( the remaining 100 were sold as 2007 Silverado SS " classic " body style trucks before the 2007.5 MY changeover .
These trucks were only available in Black Onyx exterior but could be ordered with cloth or leather interior .
Also features- VORTEC HIGH OUTPUT /
VORTEC MAX Section::::Vortec High Output / Vortec Max .
The Vortec High Output option was first introduced in 2004 to a limited market ( mainly consisting of Texas and several surrounding areas ) ; it was available nationwide for MY 2005 .
It was available for both the Chevy and GMC 1500 series trucks .
This special edition package ( under option code B4V ) included several options previously not found on the standard 1500 model , most notably the LQ9 6.0 L V-8 engine ( the same used for the Silverado SS , the 2005 - 2006 GMC Denalis and the Cadillac Escalade ) .
The LQ9 motor was rated at at 5200 rpm and of torque at 4000 rpm , which was the same specifications shared in the SS models .
The B4V package could only be ordered on extended cab standard box 2WD trucks .
They were all built at the Canadian assembly plant and were equipped with the Z60 High Performance suspension package , in addition to the M32 = 4L65E transmission , GT4 = 3.73 rear gear , and G80 Gov Lock as standard equipment .
The 2004 models were equipped with the standard 10 bolt 8.625 rear end .
The 2005 models were upgraded with the larger 14 bolt 9.5 rear end under RPO option AXN .
The package also included one style of the newly introduced GM 20 inch wheels installed from the factory .
This marked the first time the LQ9 engine was available for a two - wheel drive application .
Unlike the previous years with the SS Package , you could order the interior combination in anything from basic cloth to fully loaded .
There were also more exterior color options available with this package .
In 2006 , the Vortec Max trailering package became available .
The Vortec Max package was added to the option list with an array of similar features and new badges , and at its core retained the LQ9/4L65-E powertrain .
However , the Vortec Max package differed from the Performance edition in that it also came with a variant of the Z85 Handling / Trailering suspension , as well as 17-inch wheels and tires under the option code NHT on 4x4 models versus the Z60 High Performance Suspension and 20-inch wheel and tire package of the regular B4V 2 wheel drive Performance Edition .
This was because the Vortec Max package was intended for max trailer towing , while the Performance Edition was intended more for customers who wanted the Silverado SS mechanicals without the visuals of the SS .
It was also made available ( in addition to the extended cab ) in the light duty 4 door crew cab models .
For the first time it was also available in 2 wheel drive or 4 wheel drive on both the Silverados and Sierras , with or without the Z71 package .
The newest Vortec Max performance package introduced in 2006 on the GMT900 includes a 10,800 pounds towing capacity .
HYBRID
Section::::Hybrid .
GM launched a hybrid version of the Silverado / Sierra in 2004 , becoming the first ever GM hybrid passenger vehicle .
Known within GM as the Parallel Hybrid Truck or PHT
it is not actually a parallel hybrid by the current definition , but a type of micro hybrid design .
The electric motor housed within the transmission flywheel housing , serves only to provide engine cranking / starting , battery charging , and powering accessories .
The engine automatically shuts down as the truck comes to a stop and uses 42 Volt electric power to the starter / generator unit to restart the engine as the brake pedal is released .
Besides the typical 12 V automotive battery the PHT uses three additional 12 V valve regulated lead acid ( VRLA ) batteries mounted under the rear seat to store and provide power .
The truck uses a 5.3 L Vortec 5300 V8 for primary propulsion power .
These trucks were also purchased back from customers for more than what they were worth in the late 2000s .
The PHT features four 120 volt 20 amp AC outlets , two in the bed and two inside the cab under the rear seat .
These are particularly interesting to the building / construction contractor market , since they often require AC power when on the job .
Additionally , the extra reserves of power for the accessories make this truck well - suited to that market , where trucks often sit at idle for hours at a time .
Availability was extremely limited at first , with commercial buyers getting the first allotment .
Later in 2005 , the truck was offered at retail in Alaska , California , Florida , Nevada , Oregon , Washington and Canada .
For 2006–07 the truck was generally available to retail buyers throughout North America .
The Parallel Hybrid Truck was discontinued for the 2008 model year with the release of the GMT900 truck line .
Starting in 2009 , General Motors offers a second generation Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra equipped with a Two - Mode Hybrid powertrain and CVT .
HEAVY DUTY Section::::Heavy duty .
The HD variant is a heavy - duty light truck .
It is a strengthened version of the Silverado / Sierra light - duty , and is available in the 1500HD , 2500HD , and 3500HD models .
The 1500HD , introduced in 2000 , offers a Vortec 6000 V8 with at 5200 rpm and of torque at 4000 rpm with a Hydra - Matic 4L80E four - speed automatic transmission .
The 2500HD also offers the LB7 Duramax V8 with at 3100 rpm and of torque at 1800 rpm , the LLY Duramax V8 with 310 hp ( 231 kW ) at 3000 rpm and 605 lb·ft ( 820 N·m ) at 1600 rpm , and the LBZ Duramax V8 with 360 hp ( 268 kW ) at 3200 rpm and 650 lb·ft ( 881 N·m ) at 1600 rpm .
Also available is the Vortec 8100 V8 with at 4200 rpm and of torque at 3200 rpm .
The 2500HD has an available five - speed ( six - speed for 2006 - 2007 models )
Allison 1000 transmission with the Vortec 8100 and Duramax 6.6 .
The Silverado 3500 offers the same engine / transmission features that the 2500HD does , however it is usually equipped with " dually " twin wheels at the rear and has a stronger suspension .
The HD models are primarily used for towing and high - weight cargo .
The Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD came in at # 2 in a 2016 study by iSeeCars.com ranking the top 10 longest - lasting vehicles .
The Silverado 2500HD had 5.7 % of vehicles over 200,000 miles , according to the iSeeCars study .
: )
Towing capacity for the 1500HD is rated at and can haul in the bed depending on options .
Towing capacity for the 2500HD is rated at with the gasoline 8.1L V8 with 3.73:1 rear and can haul in the bed depending on options .
Towing capacity for the 3500HD is rated at and can haul in the bed depending on options .
The addition of 4 wheel drive tends to reduce the towing and carrying capacity by 200 to , depending upon year and model .
Other factors , such as options , can also affect these numbers .

SECOND GENERATION ( 2007–2014 )
Section::::Second generation ( 2007–2014 ) .
The all - new GMT900 generation of the Silverado / Sierra arrived in the last quarter of 2006 as a 2007 model .
It features a redesigned exterior , interior , frame , and suspension as well as power increases on certain engines .
It takes styling cues from the 2007 GMT900 SUVs and the Chevrolet Colorado pickups .
Like the GMT900 SUVs , these pickups also have greatly improved aerodynamics over their predecessors like steeply raked windshields and tighter panel gaps which improve fuel economy .
The GMT800 models were continued through 2007 badged as " Classic " , just as the GMT400 models continued for two years after the GMT800 's introduction .
The new Silverado earned the North American Truck of the Year award for 2007 and was Motor Trend magazine 's Truck of the Year for 2007 .
Like its predecessors , the new Silverado offers buyers a choice of two door regular cabs , four door extended cabs ( with rear doors that now open 170 degrees similar to the Nissan Titan ) and four door crew cabs with the rear doors opening in the same direction as the front doors .
GM also offers the trucks in the traditional two and four wheel drive configurations .
For the ' 07 model year , the Sierra Denali shares
the same billet grille from the other Denali models , and also has the same dash as the ' 07 SUV 's .
The ' 07 Sierra Denali was initially the only half - ton pickup that had a 6.2 liter with and of torque coupled to a six - speed transmission .
This truck is also an optional all - wheel drive vehicle and goes 0 - 60 mph in 6.3 seconds .
The Generation III small block V8 engines offered in the GMT 800 trucks were replaced in the GMT 900 series by the Generation IV small block V8 engine family , featuring upgrades such as increased power and Active Fuel Management on the 5.3 L and 6.0 L V8s .
A new high performance 6.2 liter V8 ( with and of torque ) was introduced with the 2007 Cadillac Escalade and 2007 GMC Denali line , and is now available on the Silverado LTZ trim line .
After skipping the 2008 model year , with 2007 being the last for the GMT800 hybrid line , a two - mode hybrid model was introduced in late 2008 as a 2009 model .
General Motors discontinued the Silverado Hybrid due to poor sales along with the GMC Sierra Hybrid , Chevy Avalanche , Chevy Tahoe Hybrid , GMC Yukon Hybrid , Cadillac Escalade Hybrid , and Cadillac Escalade EXT after the 2013 model year even though it was the one of the two first hybrid pickup trucks ever manufactured .
Available in either two- or four - wheel - drive , the Sierra 1500 Hybrid is powered by a 6.0-liter V8 .
It 's joined by two 60-kilowatt electric motors supplied by a nickel – metal hydride battery pack under the rear seat .
On its own , the V8 is rated at 332 horsepower and 367 pound - feet of torque .
GM engineers say that combined output with the electric motors is 379 hp .
The unique transmission houses the electric motors along with three different planetary gear sets and four traditional clutches .
There were two dash options offered in this model Silverado and Sierra : a luxury - inspired dash that closely mimics the dash in their GMT900 SUVs , and a more traditional upright dash to make room for a passenger seat in place of a center console .
As of 2008 , General Motors full - size trucks were no longer sold in United States and Canada with manual transmissions ; they were only offered in Mexico in the Silverado 1500 V6 engine and Silverado 3500 .
All Silverado & Sierra 1/2-ton models received a revised bumper and shortened front fascia for the 2009 model year , and extended and crew cab models equipped with the Vortec 5300 V8 received a new six - speed 6L80 automatic transmission .
The Vortec 6200 V8 was made available for LTZ and SLT models .
Bluetooth was added to the equipment list , becoming standard on Denali , SLT , and LTZ and optional on SLE and LT , as was an optional rear vision camera .
An integrated trailer brake controller , first available on the Silverado and Sierra HD for 2007 , is now an option on 1500 series trucks .
The XFE package was new for 2009 , available only on Silverado 1500 Crew Cab LT 2 wheel drive models , it included the 5.3L Vortec V8 , soft tonneau cover , aluminum wheels , and low rolling resistance tires .
A full mid - cycle refresh followed with all 2010 models , including new interior door panels ( which moved the handle forward and added an additional cup holder ) and a six - speed automatic transmission on regular cab models with the 5.3L V8 was also made standard .
The Vortec 6200 V8 was given wider availability , now being optional on LT and SLE extended and crew cabs .
The new Z71 Appearance Package was optional on LT and LTZ , it included : body - color grille and front fascia , body color door handles and mirror caps , unique Z71 box side decals , chrome sill plates , and a unique Z71 gauge cluster .
Two new exterior colors were added : Taupe Gray Metallic and Sheer Silver Metallic .
For 2012 , the Sierra and Silverado 1500 received another mid - cycle refresh .
This time the Silverado was given new grille and front fascia treatments for both LT and LTZ models .
A newly redesigned touch - screen navigation radio was optional on LTZ , SLT , and Denali .
Trailer sway control and hill start assist are now standard on all models .
Cooled seats were made optional on LTZ and SLT and the woodgrain trim was replaced with brushed aluminum .
The 8.1 L big - block V8 is no longer offered on the Heavy Duty models , and no replacement has been announced .
The 6L90 6-speed automatic transmission is standard in all Heavy Duty models .
The Allison 1000 transmission is paired with the optional Duramax V8 diesel .
As of 2011 the GMC and Chevrolet heavy Duty 's have being upgraded with a new fully boxed high strength steel frame from front to rear improving stiffness by 92 % with bigger rear springs , larger engine and transmission mounts and new hydraulic body mounts to improve the ride .
The front suspension incorporates new upper and lower control arms and new torsion bars tailored to one of five different gross axle weight ratings .
Upper control arms are constructed from forged steel that is both stronger and lighter than the previous arms , while the new lower arms are cast iron to maximize load capacity .
Using a unique torsion bar for each gross weight rating allows for better control over vehicle height , resulting in improved handling and better alignment for reduced tire wear .
These improvements allow for up to a 6,000 pound front axle weight rating , allowing all 4wd trucks to accommodate a snow plow .
Additional front suspension enhancements come from new urethane bump stops , two per side .
The upper shock mount has been changed from a single stem mount to a two - bolt design to eliminate the possibility of squeaks and thumps .
The rear suspension design uses asymmetrical leaf springs that are wider and capable of greater load handling .
The design features 3-inch wide leaves , with front and rear spring sections of different lengths to reduce the twisting that can result in axle hop and loss of traction .
The 2500HD use a two - stage design with a rating of 6,200 lbs , and 3500HD models have a three - stage design with 7,050 lb and 9,375 lb ratings on single and dual - wheel models respectively ENGINES Section::::Engines . !
