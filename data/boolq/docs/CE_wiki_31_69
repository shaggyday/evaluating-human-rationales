DRAG LINK
A drag link converts rotary motion from a crank arm , to a second bellcrank , usually in an automotive steering system .
AUTOMOTIVE USE
Section::::Automotive use .
The term is commonly used in automotive technology for the link in steering linkage that converts rotation of a pitman arm to a steering arm and eventually to tie rod links which pivot the wheels to be steered .
The drag link converts the sweeping arc of the steering arm to linear motion in the plane of the other steering links .
Typically , one end of the drag link is connected via the Pitman arm and steering gearbox to the steering wheel ( providing the connection between the driver and the steering system ) ; the other end is attached to the steering linkage , by the steering arm .
An alternate steering mechanism is a rack and pinion , a three bar linkage that eliminates the drag link by directly moving a center link .
" The drag link connects the pitman arm to the steering arm , or in some applications it connects to the tie rod assembly .
Unlike a center link , the drag link does not connect to an idler arm , and has no inner tie rod ends attached to it .
On some applications the drag link swings from the front to the rear of the vehicle .
On these applications the drag link connects to the steering arm located at the wheel .
In some Jeep applications , the drag link will swing from right to left on the vehicle and will connect to the steering arm at the wheel .
Drag links can be a solid one - piece design or an adjustable design .
Many drag links have replaceable or rebuildable ends . "
EFFECT OF WEAR Section::::Effect of wear .
Severe wear of this part can affect the wheel alignment .
This can drastically affect the handling and stability of the vehicle at speed .
