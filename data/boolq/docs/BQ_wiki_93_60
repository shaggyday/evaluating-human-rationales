SYNDROME OF INAPPROPRIATE ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE SECRETION
Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( SIADH ) is characterized by excessive unsuppressible release of antidiuretic hormone ( ADH ) either from the posterior pituitary gland , or an abnormal non - pituitary source .
Unsuppressed ADH causes an unrelenting increase in solute - free water being returned by the tubules of the kidney to the venous circulation .
The causes of SIADH are grouped into six categories : 1 ) central nervous system diseases that directly stimulate the hypothalamus , the site of control of ADH secretion ; 2 ) various cancers that synthesize and secrete ectopic ADH ; 3 ) various lung diseases ; 4 ) numerous drugs that chemically stimulate the hypothalamus ; 5 ) inherited mutations ; and 6 ) miscellaneous largely transient conditions .
ADH is derived from a preprohormone precursor that is synthesized in cells in the hypothalamus and stored in vesicles in the posterior pituitary .
Appropriate ADH secretion is regulated by osmoreceptors on the hypothalamic cells that synthesize and store ADH : plasma hypertonicity activates these receptors , ADH is released into the blood stream , the kidney increases solute - free water return to the circulation , and the hypertonicity is alleviated .
Inappropriate ( increased )
ADH secretion causes an unrelenting increase in solute - free water ( " free water " ) absorption by the kidneys , with two consequences .
First , in the extracellular fluid ( ECF ) space , there is a dilution of blood solutes , causing hypoosmolality , including a low sodium concentration - hyponatremia .
Then virtually simultaneously , in the intracellular space , cells swell , i.e. intracellular volume increases .
Swelling of brain cells causes various neurological abnormalities which in severe or acute cases can result in convulsions , coma , and death .
Potential treatments of SIADH include restriction of fluid intake , correction of an identifiable reversible underlying cause , and/or medication which promotes solute - free water excretion by the kidney .
The presence of cerebral edema may necessitate intravenous isotonic or hypertonic saline administration .
SIADH was originally described in 1957 in two people with small - cell carcinoma of the lung .

Causes of SIADH include conditions that dysregulate ADH secretion in the central nervous system , tumors that secrete ADH , drugs that increase ADH secretion , and many others .
A list of common causes is below : PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Section::::Pathophysiology .
Normally there are homeostatic processes in the body which maintain the concentration of body solutes within a narrow range , both inside and outside cells .
The process occurs as follows : in some hypothalamic cells there are osmoreceptors which respond to hyperosmolality in body fluids by signalling the posterior pituitary gland to secrete ADH .
This keeps serum sodium concentration - a proxy for solute concentration - at normal levels , prevents hypernatremia and turns off the osmoreceptors .
Specifically , when the serum sodium rises above142 mEq / L , ADH secretion is maximal ( and thirst is stimulated as well ) ; when it is below 135 mEq / L , there is no secretion .
ADH activates V2 receptors on the basolateral membrane of principal cells in the renal collecting duct , initiating a cyclic AMP - dependent process that culminates in increased production of water channels ( aquaporin 2 ) , and their insertion into the cells ' luminal membranes .
Excessive ADH causes an inappropriate increase in the reabsorption in the kidneys of solute - free water ( " free water " ) : excess water moves from the distal convoluted tubules ( DCT)s and collecting tubules of the nephrons - via activation of aquaporins , the site of the ADH receptors - back into the circulation .
This has two consequences .
First , in the extracellular fluid ( ECF ) space , there is a dilution of blood solutes , causing hypoosmolality , including a low sodium concentration - hyponatremia .
[ There is no expansion of the ECF volume because as it attempts to expand , aldosterone is suppressed and atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP ) is stimulated : both of these hormones cause isotonic ECF fluid to be excreted by the kidneys sufficient to keep ECF volume at a normal level . ]
Also , virtually simultaneously to these ECF events , the intracellular space ( ICF ) volume expands .
This is because the osmolality of the ECF is ( transiently ) less than that of the ICF ; and since water is readily permeable to cell membranes , solute - free water moves from the ECF to the ICF compartment by osmosis : all cells swell .
Swelling of brain cells - cerebral edema - causes various neurological abnormalities which in acute and/or severe cases can result in convulsions , coma , and death .
The normal function of ADH on the kidneys is to control the amount of water reabsorbed by kidney nephrons .
ADH acts in the distal portion of the renal tubule ( Distal Convoluted Tubule ) as well as on the collecting duct and causes the retention of water , but not solute .
Hence , ADH activity effectively dilutes the blood ( decreasing the concentrations of solutes such as sodium ) , causing hyponatremia ; this is compounded by the fact that the body responds to water retention by decreasing aldosterone , thus allowing even more sodium wasting .
For this reason , a high urinary sodium excretion will be seen .
The abnormalities underlying type D syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion concern individuals where vasopressin release and response are normal but where abnormal renal expression and translocation of aquaporin 2 , or both are found .
It has been suggested that this is due to abnormalities in the secretion of secretin in the brain and that " Secretin as a neurosecretory hormone from the posterior pituitary , therefore , could be the long - sought vasopressin independent mechanism to solve the riddle that has puzzled clinicians and physiologists for decades .
" There are no abnormalities in total body sodium metabolism .
Hyponatremia and inappropriately concentrated urine (
U > 100 mOsm / L ) are seen DIAGNOSIS Section::::Diagnosis .
Diagnosis is based on clinical and laboratory findings of low serum osmolality and low serum sodium .
Urinalysis reveals a highly concentrated urine with a high fractional excretion of sodium ( high sodium urine content compared to the serum sodium ) .
A suspected diagnosis is based on a serum sodium under 138 .
A confirmed diagnosis has seven elements : 1 ) a decreased effective serum osmolality - < 275 mOsm / kg of water ; 2 ) urinary sodium concentration high - over 40 mEq / L with adequate dietary salt intake ; 3 ) no recent diuretic usage ; 4 ) no signs of ECF volume depletion or excess ; 5 )
no signs of decreased arterial blood volume - cirrhosis , nephrosis , or congestive heart failure ; 6 ) normal adrenal and thyroid function ; and 7 ) no evidence of hyperglycemia ( diabetes mellitus ) , hypertriglyceridemia , or hyperproteinia ( myeloma ) .
There are nine supplemental features : 1 ) a low BUN ; 2 ) a low uric acid ;
3 ) a normal creatinine ; 4 ) failure to correct hyponatremia with IV normal saline ; 5 ) successful correction of hyponatremia with fluid restriction ; 6 ) a fractional sodium excretion > 1 % ; 7 ) a fractional urea excretion > 55 % ; 8) an abnormal water load test ; and 9 ) an elevated plasma
AVP .
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Section::::Differential diagnosis .
Antidiuretic hormone ( ADH ) is released from the posterior pituitary for a number of physiologic reasons .
The majority of people with hyponatremia , other than those with excessive water intake ( polydipsia ) or renal salt wasting , will have elevated ADH as the cause of their hyponatremia .
However , not every person with hyponatremia and elevated ADH has SIADH .
One approach to a diagnosis is to divide ADH release into appropriate ( not SIADH ) or inappropriate ( SIADH ) .
Appropriate ADH release can be a result of hypovolemia , a so - called osmotic trigger of ADH release .
This may be true hypovolemia , as a result of dehydration with fluid losses replaced by free water .
It can also be perceived hypovolemia , as in the conditions of congestive heart failure ( CHF ) and cirrhosis in which the kidneys perceive a lack of intravascular volume .
The hyponatremia caused by appropriate ADH release ( from the kidneys ' perspective ) in both CHF and cirrhosis have been shown to be an independent poor prognostic indicator of mortality .
Appropriate ADH release can also be a result of non - osmotic triggers .
Symptoms such as nausea / vomiting and pain are significant causes of ADH release .
The combination of osmotic and non - osmotic triggers of ADH release can adequately explain the hyponatremia in the majority of people who are hospitalized with acute illness and are found to have mild to moderate hyponatremia .
SIADH is less common than appropriate release of ADH .
While it should be considered in a differential , other causes should be considered as well .
Cerebral salt wasting syndrome ( CSWS ) also presents with hyponatremia , there are signs of dehydration for which reason the management is diametrically opposed to SIADH .
Importantly CSWS can be associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) which may require fluid supplementation rather than restriction to prevent brain damage .
Most cases of hyponatremia in children are caused by appropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone rather than SIADH or another cause .
TREATMENT Section::::Treatment .
How to manage SIADH depends on whether symptoms are present , the severity of the hyponatremia , and the duration .
Management of SIADH includes :
* Removing the underlying cause when possible .
* Mild and asymptomatic hyponatremia is treated with adequate solute intake ( including salt and protein ) and fluid restriction starting at 500 ml per day of water with adjustments based on serum sodium levels .
Long - term fluid restriction of 1,200–1,800 mL / day may maintain the person in a symptom free state .
* Moderate and symptomatic hyponatremia is treated by raising the serum sodium level by 0.5 to 1 mmol per liter per hour for a total of 8 mmol per liter during the first day with the use of furosemide and replacing sodium and potassium losses with 0.9 % saline .
*
For people with severe symptoms ( severe confusion , convulsions , or coma ) hypertonic saline ( 3 % ) 1–2 ml / kg IV in 3–4 h should be given .
* Drugs
* Demeclocycline can be used in chronic situations when fluid restrictions are difficult to maintain ; demeclocycline is the most potent inhibitor of Vasopressin ( ADH / AVP ) action .
However , demeclocycline has a 2–3 day delay in onset with extensive side effect profile , including skin photosensitivity , and nephrotoxicity .
* Urea : oral daily ingestion has shown favorable long - term results with protective effects in myelinosis and brain damage .
Limitations noted to be undesirable taste and is contraindicated in people with cirrhosis to avoid initiation or potentiation of hepatic encephalopathy .
* Conivaptan – an antagonist of both V and V vasopressin receptors .
* Tolvaptan – an antagonist of the V vasopressin receptor .
Raising the serum sodium concentration too rapidly may cause central pontine myelinolysis .
Avoid correction by more than 12 mEq / L / day .
Initial treatment with hypertonic saline may abruptly lead to a rapid dilute diuresis and fall in ADH .
EPIDEMIOLOGY Section::::Epidemiology .
The incidence of SIADH rises with increasing age .
Residents of nursing homes are at highest risk .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The condition was first described at separate institutions by William Schwartz and Frederic Bartter ) in two people with lung cancer .
Criteria were developed by Schwartz and Bartter in 1967 and have remained unchanged since then .
SOCIETY AND CULTURE Section::::Society and culture .
The condition is occasionally referred to by the names of the authors of the first report : Schwartz - Bartter syndrome .
Because not all people with this syndrome have elevated levels of vasopressin , the term " syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis " ( SIAD ) has been proposed as a more accurate description of this condition .
