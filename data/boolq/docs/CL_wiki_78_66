ANTERIOR TIBIAL VEIN
The anterior tibial vein is a vein in the lower leg .
In human anatomy , there are two anterior tibial veins .
They originates and receive blood from the dorsal pedis veins , on the back of the foot and empties into the popliteal vein .
The anterior tibial veins drain the ankle joint , knee joint , tibiofibular joint , and the anterior portion of the lower leg .
The two anterior tibial veins ascend in the interosseous membrane between the tibia and fibula and unite with the posterior tibial veins to form the popliteal vein .
Like most deep veins in legs , anterior tibial veins are accompanied by the homonym artery , the anterior tibial artery , along its course .
