AAA BATTERY
An AAA or triple - A battery is a standard size of dry cell battery commonly used in low - drain portable electronic devices .
A zinc – carbon battery in this size is designated by IEC as " R03 " , by ANSI C18.1 as " 24 " , by old JIS standard as " UM 4 " , and by other manufacturer and national standard designations that vary depending on the cell chemistry .
A triple - A battery is a single cell and measures in diameter and in length , including the positive terminal button , which is a minimum .
The positive terminal has a maximum diameter of ; the flat negative terminal has a minimum diameter of .
Alkaline AAA batteries weigh around , while primary lithium AAA batteries weigh about .
Rechargeable nickel – metal hydride ( NiMH )
AAA batteries typically weigh .
USE Section::::Use .
AAA batteries are most often used in small electronic devices , such as TV remote controls , MP3 players and digital cameras .
Devices that require the same voltage , but have a higher current draw , are often designed to use larger batteries such as the AA battery type .
AA batteries have about three times the capacity of AAA batteries .
With the increasing efficiency and miniaturization of modern electronics , many devices that previously were designed for AA batteries ( remote controls , cordless computer mice and keyboards , etc . ) are being replaced by models that accept AAA battery cells .
As of 2007 , AAA batteries accounted for 24 % of alkaline primary battery sales in the United States .
In Japan as of 2011 , 28 % of alkaline primary batteries sold were AAA .
In Switzerland as of 2008 , AAA batteries totaled 30 % of primary battery sales and 32 % of secondary battery sales . !
