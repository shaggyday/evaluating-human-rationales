LEAVING ON
A JET PLANE
" Leaving on a Jet Plane " is a song written by John Denver in 1966 and most famously recorded by Peter , Paul and Mary .
The original title of the song was " Babe , I Hate to Go " , as featured on his 1966 studio album John Denver Sings , but Denver 's then producer Milt Okun convinced him to change the title .
Peter , Paul and Mary recorded the song for their 1967 Album 1700 but only released it as a single in 1969 .
It turned out to be Peter , Paul and Mary 's biggest ( and final ) hit , becoming their only No . 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States .
The song also spent three weeks atop the easy listening chart and was used in commercials for United Airlines in the late 1960s and early 1970s .
The song also topped the charts in Canada , and reached No . 2 in both the UK Singles Chart and Irish Singles Chart in February 1970 .
In 1969 , John Denver recorded a version of the song for his debut solo album , Rhymes & Reasons , and re - recorded it in 1973 for John Denver 's Greatest Hits .
His version was featured in the end credits of The Guard .
