FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS ( TV SERIES )
Friday Night Lights is an American drama television series about a high school football team in the fictional town of Dillon , Texas .
It was developed by Peter Berg and executive produced by Brian Grazer , David Nevins , Sarah Aubrey and Jason Katims , based on by H. G. Bissinger , adapted as the 2004 film of the same name .
The series ' primary setting , Dillon , is a small , close - knit community in rural Texas .
Team coach Eric Taylor ( Kyle Chandler ) and his family , Tami , Julie and Grace , are featured .
The show uses this small - town backdrop to address many issues facing contemporary American culture , including family values , school funding , racism , drugs , abortion and lack of economic opportunities .
Produced by NBCUniversal , Friday Night Lights premiered on October 3 , 2006 , and aired for two seasons on NBC .
Although the show had garnered critical acclaim and passionate fans , the series suffered low ratings and was in danger of cancellation after the second season .
To save the series , NBC struck a deal with DirecTV to co - produce three more seasons ; each subsequent season premiered on DirecTV 's 101 Network , with NBC rebroadcasts a few months later .
The series ended its run on The 101 Network on February 9 , 2011 , after five seasons .
Though Friday Night Lights never garnered a sizable audience , it was a critical success , lauded for its realistic portrayal of Middle America and deep exploration of its central characters .
The show appeared on a number of best lists and was awarded a Peabody Award , a Humanitas Prize , a Television Critics Association Award and several technical Primetime Emmy Awards .
At the 2011 Primetime Emmy Awards , the show was nominated for Outstanding Drama Series .
Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton also scored multiple nominations for the Outstanding Lead Actor and Actress awards for a drama series .
Executive producer Jason Katims was nominated for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series .
Chandler and Katims each won the Emmy in 2011 .
BACKGROUND INSPIRATION Section::::Background .
Section::::Inspiration .
Friday Night Lights was inspired by H.G. " Buzz " Bissinger 's non - fiction book ( 1990 ) and the 2004 film based on it .
The book , which explores the 1988 season of the Permian Panthers , a high school football team in Odessa , Texas , was a factual work of documentary journalism .
The people featured were not renamed in the book .
The Universal Pictures film , which stars Billy Bob Thornton and was directed by Peter Berg , Bissinger 's second cousin , based its characters on the residents of Odessa c. 1988 .
CONCEPTION Section::::Conception .
Once filming on the movie was completed , Berg began to explore adapting the story for television .
Berg later said he had regretted having to jettison many of the interpersonal topics from the book because of the time constraints of a feature film .
Creating a TV series , particularly one based on fictional characters , allowed him to address many of those elements in - depth .
He decided to set the series in a fictional town of Dillon , Texas , with some characteristics of Odessa .
The football team was given the Panthers name .
Berg deliberately carried elements from the film to the series , particularly for the pilot , which was closely related to the film .
He cast Connie Britton as the wife of head coach Eric Taylor , and Brad Leland as Buddy Garrity , a major businessman and football booster , in roles similar to those they played in the film .
PRODUCTION Section::::Production .
Filming for the show 's pilot began in February 2006 in Austin , Texas .
Berg said he required filming the pilot and eventually the show in Texas as " a deal breaker " in order to agree to participate weekly in the project .
The show features homages to its Texas heritage .
In the pilot , Berg featured former Texas Longhorns football coach Mack Brown as a Dillon booster and had a caller to the fictional Panther Radio compare Panthers ' coach Eric Taylor to Brown .
The pilot referred to much of the surrounding area in its scenes .
Football scenes were filmed at Pflugerville High School 's Kuempel Stadium and at the RRISD Complex .
The Dillon Panther football team and coaches ' uniforms were based on the uniforms of the Pflugerville Panthers .
Some of the scenes were filmed at Texas School for the Deaf .
Berg 's observation of local high school students while preparing to film the movie inspired his development of some of the characters .
For example , Jason Street , the character whose promising football career is ended by a spinal injury in the pilot , was inspired by a local event .
David Edwards , a football player from San Antonio 's Madison High , was paralyzed during a November 2003 game .
Berg was at the game when this accident occurred ; he was profoundly affected by Edwards ' injury and how it overturned his life .
Berg set up a similar incident in the pilot .
PERFORMANCES Section::::Performances .
While relying on a script each week , the producers decided at the outset to allow the cast leeway in what they said and did on the show .
Their decisions could affect the delivery of their lines and the blocking of each scene .
If the actors felt that something was untrue to their character or a mode of delivery did n't work , they were free to change it , provided they still hit the vital plot points .
This freedom was complemented by filming without rehearsal and without extensive blocking .
Camera operators were trained to follow the actors , rather than having the actors stand in one place with cameras fixed around them .
The actors knew that the filming would work around them .
Executive producer Jeffrey Reiner described this method as " no rehearsal , no blocking , just three cameras and we shoot . "
Working in this fashion profoundly influenced everyone involved with the show .
Series star Kyle Chandler said : " When I look back at my life , I 'm going to say , ' Wow , [ executive producer ]
Peter Berg really changed my life . '
" Executive producer and head writer Jason Katims echoed this sentiment , saying : " When I first came on [ the FNL ] set , I thought , it 's interesting â€“ this is what I imagined filmmaking would be , before I saw what filmmaking was . " FILMING Section::::Filming .
All five seasons of Friday Night Lights were filmed in Austin and Pflugerville .
With the show yielding roughly $ 33 million a year in revenue , other states courted the production company after the state of Texas failed to pay all the rebates it had promised to the show 's producers .
The Texas legislature authorized funding to match the offers of other states , and the production company preferred to stay near Austin , so the show remained in Texas .
Friday Night Lights is unusual for using actual locations rather than stage sets and sound stage .
These factors together with reliance on filming hundreds of locals as extras , gives the series an authentic feel and look .
The producers used a documentary - style filming technique .
Three cameras were used for each shoot and entire scenes were shot in one take .
In contrast , most productions film a scene from each angle and typically repeat the scene several times while readjusting lighting to accommodate each shot .
The first takes usually made the final cut .
By filming a scene all at once , the producers tried to create an environment for the actors that was more organic and allowed for the best performances .
The series borrowed the uniforms , cheerleaders , fans and stadium of the Pflugerville Panthers .
Producers shot Pflugerville games and used them as game footage in the series .
University of Southern California football announcers Peter Arbogast and Paul McDonald provided off - screen commentary during the football game sequences .
The facilities , colors and bobcat logos of Texas State University in San Marcos were used as the setting and creative inspiration for the fictional Texas Methodist University .
The show features the fictional Herrmann Field , named for George Herrmann , the head coach of the Pflugerville Panthers .
Some scenes were filmed outside Texas .
On June 20 , 2010 , scenes were filmed at Temple University , which was to portray the fictional Braemore College .
An episode from Julie 's senior year in high school was filmed in the Boston area , at Boston College , Boston University , and Tufts University .
Some scenes at fictional Oklahoma Tech University were filmed at Gregory Gym at The University of Texas at Austin .
MARKETING
Section::::Marketing .
Initially targeted at the youth market , the show emphasized the football element .
NBC teamed with social networking site Bebo to create a site that allowed students to upload video and photos , as well as create blogs about their local football teams .
Students who participated were eligible for one of 10 $ 5,000 scholarships .
NBC had negotiated with Bebo for network and series promotion on Bebo 's network of youth - oriented sites including Piczo , Hi5 , Tickle , Ringo , and FastWeb .
To complement this promotion , NBC sent out " School Spirit " kits to 1,000 high schools around the country .
These kits included posters , pom - poms , mini - footballs and disposable cameras , all bearing the show 's logo .
The kits also contained copies of the show 's pilot episode on DVD .
The network repeated this promotion for its second season promotion , when it teamed with HouseParty.com to send out 1,000 " Party Kits , " which contained advance copies of the Season 2 opener along with other promotional material .
NBC also paired with Toyota to create the " Hometown Sweepstakes " , in which students could earn cash grants of up to $ 50,000 for their school 's athletics program .
It was open to high school students ages 14 to 18 and was designed to draw people to the show 's official website , where they could download AOL Instant Messenger icons , screensavers and desktop wallpaper .
Students who registered could also download free movie theater passes to special early screenings of the pilot episode .
These movie theater screenings took place in 50 cities nationwide and ran until a week before the show premiered on NBC .
In the later part of the season , NBC chose to switch course and pursue the female demographic .
The network designed a strategy based on the personal elements of the show , giving the show the tagline ,
" It 's about life " .
NBC Marketing President Vince Manze stressed that the goal was to ensure viewers that the show was family and relationships as well as athletics .
The network ran 30-second spots in movie theaters that featured cast members and fans being interviewed about the show .

If we were leading to the end of the season [ under normal circumstances ] , we would have most likely brought the story around to the coach and his family again , " and there would have been a strong football element as well , Katims said .

SEASON FOUR
Section::::Season four .
Season 4 kicks off with Eric Taylor struggling as the East Dillon High coach .
The team , field and conditions are a complete change from the privileged and sparkling conditions at West Dillon .
East Dillon High resembles Odessa High from the source novel , Permian High 's sister school and the home of the Odessa Bronchos , with whom they have an annual rivalry match which divides the town .
The East Dillon Lions and Odessa Bronchos both wear red uniforms and are considered underdogs to the Panthers .
Additionally , Odessa High and East Dillon are both underfunded and considered inferior compared to their rival school , and serve a predominately poor minority community .
Additionally , the school district boundaries between East and West Dillon were intentionally drawn to ensure the majority of talented players would be zoned for West Dillon ; the districts between Permian and Odessa High were drawn in a similar manner .
As Coach begins putting together his new Lion team , he realizes he 's in for more than he bargained for .
The players who try out are less than desirable , but Coach gets a lucky break with a couple of new faces .
The first is Vince Howard ( Michael B. Jordan ) , a student who has gotten in trouble with the law too many times .
He is given one last chance if he plays football for the East Dillon Lions .
Although he has no prior football experience , he has natural talent and becomes the team 's first star quarterback .
The second break comes to the Lions when Buddy Garrity reveals to Eric that the address on file for the Panthers new prodigy running back , Luke Cafferty , is nothing more than a mailbox in front of an empty lot , and Luke is really zoned for East Dillon .
Tami is faced with a struggle as the principal of West Dillon .
A new character on the show , Becky , is introduced when Tim Riggins rents a trailer on her mother 's property .
Although she is in love with Tim , she and Luke are both shopping at a convenience store and she allows Luke to drive her home .
The two have sex and Becky becomes pregnant .
Even though she is a student at East Dillon , she seeks out Tami 's help with the situation .
Tami discusses all of the options with her and Becky decides to get an abortion .
Her mother goes with her to the procedure .
Parents find out about this and led by Luke 's mother , seek Mrs. Taylor 's dismissal as principal .
When Tami refuses to apologize , as she followed procedure , she is put on leave .
She decides to return to her role as a guidance counselor , but at East Dillon .
The football season is one focused on growth and reestablishing a sense of Lion pride .
The culmination of their hard work is tested in their last game of the season as they play the Dillon Panthers led by J.D. McCoy .
In an amazing show of perseverance , the East Dillon Lions defeat the Dillon Panthers , ruining the Panthers ' playoff chances .
In season four , Matt Saracen struggles with staying in Dillon and living as a townie .
He turned down an art school in Chicago and is instead studying art at the local technical college .
After returning from a hunting trip with Tim Riggins , he finds out that his father was killed in Iraq .
The episode " The Son " shows Matt going through the five stages of grief as he comes to accept the death of his father , a man he claims to hate .
This episode garnered much buzz online and resulted in a failed campaign for Zach Gilford to get an Emmy nomination in the guest actor category ; however , the episode did get an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series .
After this emotionally charged episode , Matt abruptly moves to Chicago without saying goodbye to his girlfriend or best friend .
He returns briefly in the finale and makes amends with both Julie and Landry , who ends up flying back to Chicago with Matt .
The character of Tim Riggins has developed over time from an unfocused and moody alcoholic to a young man of character and dependability .
Sometimes that dependability is reflected in his uncanny ability to make the wrong choices for the right reasons , which usually involve his brother .
Even though he has proven his ability to help others correct their misguided choices , unfortunately there is no one who does this for Tim .
In this season , his irresponsible , headstrong , but lovable brother again entices Tim into another wrong choice by convincing Tim that the only way they can make any money is by transforming their newly opened garage into a chop shop .
Just as they finally end this side business and Tim has enough for the down payment on a large amount of land he 's been dreaming about , the police show up to arrest him at the garage .
The police officers recognize Tim as " number 33 " giving Tim no chance to deny that it 's his chop shop .
True to his character , he makes the decision to take the rap and allows his brother to be with his new wife and child .
The season ends as Tim walks toward the jail .

Virginia Heffernan wrote for The New York Times that " if the season is anything like the pilot , this new drama about high school football could be great â€“ and not just television great , but great in the way of a poem or painting . "
The Washington Post similarly praised the series as " extraordinary in just about every conceivable way . "
Bill Simmons , a former columnist for ESPN Magazine implored readers of his column in the September 24 , 2007 issue to watch the show , calling it " the greatest sports - related show ever made .

two reviews were considerably less positive than for the first , with the Landry and Tyra murder plot being particularly panned by critics .

" Others were more positive , though , with Variety saying " faith should be shown in showrunner / writer Jason Katims " while The New York Times said " to hold Friday Night Lights to a measure of realism would be to miss what are its essentially expressionistic pleasures . " Time Out magazine 's Andrew Johnston included the series in his list of the ten best TV shows for both 2006 and 2007 , stating " Who 'd have thought a tribute to heartland values would turn out to be the most avant - garde show on TV ?

In an attempt to bolster series ratings , NBC repositioned reruns of the show to air on its sister network Bravo , during the weeks leading up to the season one finale on NBC .
These episodes aired on a schedule of one hour every Friday and three hours every Saturday .
Bravo is known to have an audience that is upscale and largely female , which is in line with the new strategy of NBC 's then - President Kevin Reilly ( now at FOX ) for selling the show .
When questioned about this strategy , he admitted to having regrets about initially marketing the show incorrectly , saying : " It 's been so clear to me that [ the marketing for ] the show ended up confusing people in terms of what [ the public thought ] it was supposed to be " .
He said he felt the show is , at its core , a " women 's show " , and his wish is that the marketing had reflected that to a greater extent .
Once the 2006â€“2007 television season ended , NBC planned to air reruns throughout the summer in the hopes of gaining new viewers during the summer hiatus .
Despite rising ratings for the reruns , NBC abruptly pulled them from the network 's schedule on June 24 , 2007 .
