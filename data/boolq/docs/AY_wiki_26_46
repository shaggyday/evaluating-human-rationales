COMMONWEALTH COUNTRIES UNITED KINGDOM
THE SUPREME COURT Section::::Commonwealth countries .
Section::::United Kingdom .
Section::::The Supreme Court .
Members of the old Judicial Committee of the House of Lords ( or " Law Lords " ) and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council never wore court dress ( although advocates appearing before them did ) .
Instead they were dressed in ordinary business clothing .
Since the creation of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in 2009 , the Justices of that court have retained the Law Lords ' tradition of sitting unrobed .
On ceremonial occasions they wear a robe of black damask embellished with gold with the logotype of the Supreme Court embroidered at the yoke .
ENGLAND AND WALES
WHERE COURT DRESS IS WORN Section::::England and Wales .
Section::::Where court dress is worn .
Court dress is worn at hearings in open court in all Senior Courts of England and Wales and in county courts .
However , court dress may be dispensed with at the option of the judge , e.g. in very hot weather , and invariably where it may intimidate children , e.g. , in the Family Division and at the trials of minors .
Court dress is not worn at hearings in chambers or in magistrates ' courts .
REFORM
Section::::Reform .
In July 2007 , The Baron Phillips of Worth Matravers , the serving Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales , announced that changes would be made to court working dress in the English and Welsh courts .
The reforms were due to take effect on 1 January 2008 ; however , following reports of strong opposition to the proposed changes , they were put on hold , eventually taking effect in autumn 2008 .
The new robes for judges were designed by Betty Jackson and unveiled in May 2008 , although a survey of judges published in March 2009 revealed substantial opposition to the new designs , as well as widespread annoyance at the lack of consultation prior to the change .
The Chairman of the Bar announced in April 2008 that , as a result of a survey of the profession , the Bar would recommend that advocates should retain their existing formal robes ( including wigs ) in all cases , civil and criminal , with possible exceptions in the County Court .
In a letter to the profession , he said ( in part ) : For the most part , the changes only affect what is worn by judges in civil courts , who now wear a simplified robe and no wig .
Dress worn in criminal courts remains largely unchanged .
The changes have been reflected in the dress allowances made to judges ( while the one - off cost of supplying the new civil gown was estimated at about £ 200,000 , annual savings in the region of £ 300,000 were projected ) .
ADVOCATES Section::::Advocates .
English and Welsh advocates ( whether barristers or solicitors ) who appear before a judge who is robed must themselves be robed .
All male advocates wear a white stiff wing collar with bands ( two strips of linen about hanging down the front of the neck ) .
They also wear either a dark double - breasted suit ( or with waistcoat if single - breasted ) or a black coat and waistcoat and black or grey morning dress striped trousers ( black lounge suit ) .
The black coat and waistcoat can be combined into a single garment , which is simply a waistcoat with sleeves , known as a bar jacket or court waistcoat .
Female advocates also wear a dark suit , but often wear bands attached to a collarette rather than a wing collar .
JUNIOR BARRISTERS Section::::Junior barristers .
Junior barristers wear an open - fronted black gown with open sleeves , gathered and decorated with buttons and ribbons , and a gathered yoke , over a black or dark suit , hence the term stuffgownsman for juniors .
In addition barristers wear a short horsehair wig with curls at the side and ties down the back .
SOLICITORS
Section::::Solicitors .
Solicitors wear the same wing collar with bands , or collarette , as barristers .
Their gowns are of a slightly different style , with a square collar and without gathered sleeves .
By virtue of the Consolidated Criminal Practice Direction at I.1.1 ( as amended by Practice Direction ( Court Dress ) ( No4 )
[ 2008 ]
1 WLR 257 ) , " Solicitors and other advocates authorised under the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 ... may wear short wigs in circumstances where they would be worn by Queen 's Counsel or junior counsel . "
QUEEN 'S
COUNSEL Section::::Queen 's Counsel .
Barristers or solicitors who have been appointed Queen 's Counsel ( " QCs " ) wear a silk gown with a flap collar and long closed sleeves ( the arm opening is half - way up the sleeve ) .
For this reason , barristers who are appointed Queen 's Counsel are said to have " taken silk " , and QCs themselves are colloquially called " silks " .
The QC 's black coat , known as a court coat , is cut like 18th - century court dress and the sleeve of the QC 's court coat or bar jacket has a turned back cuff with three buttons across .
On special ceremonial occasions ( such as the opening of the legal year ) , QCs wear ( in addition to their court coat , waistcoat and silk gown ) a long wig , black breeches , silk stockings and buckled shoes , lace cuffs and a lace jabot instead of bands .
JUDGES
Section::::Judges .
Judicial robes have always exhibited variety depending on the status of the judge , the type of court and other considerations .
In addition to robes , judges have generally worn a short bench wig when working in court ( reserving the long wig for ceremonial occasions ) and a wing collar and bands at the neck .
All judges in criminal cases continue to wear these traditional forms of dress , which are described in more detail below .
Judges in civil and family cases , however , have since 2008 worn a new design of working robe with no wig , collar or bands ; this plain , dark , zipped gown ( of ' midnight blue gabardine with facings in navy blue velvet ' ) is worn over an ordinary business suit and tie .
The status of the wearer is indicated by a pair of different colored tabs below the collar :
Appeal Court judges wear gold tabs , High Court judges wear red tabs , Masters of the High Court wear pink , and District judges wear blue .
It was originally envisaged that Circuit judges sitting in the High Court would likewise adopt the new - style robe with purple tabs , but they opted to retain their violet robe as worn in the County Court .
On special ceremonial occasions ( such as the opening of the legal year ) more elaborate forms of traditional dress are worn , by civil and criminal judges alike .
THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Section::::The Lord Chief Justice .
The Lord Chief Justice , when robed , dresses like a High Court Judge ( see below ) with the distinction of a train to his scarlet robe .
On ceremonial occasions he wears the scarlet and fur hood and mantle , and in addition a gold chain of office in the form of a collar of esses .

Judges in the Court of Appeal , Criminal Division , wear the same black silk gown and court coat as QCs , together with the short bench wig .
Judges of the Civil Division did likewise until 2008 , but they now wear the new - style robe .

In addition , the judge wears a wing collar , bands , and a short wig .
( Prior to 2008 this robe was only worn in the winter months ; in summer months a different scarlet robe was worn , with grey silk facings in place of the fur .
The ' summer ' robe is no longer routinely provided , but its use is still permitted in court . )
In civil cases , High Court judges wear the new - style robe with red tabs at the collar , and no wig , collar or bands .

Since autumn 2008 , circuit judges in the County Court have not worn wigs , wing collars or bands ; however , circuit judges in the Crown Court retain the wig , wing collars and bands .
Prior to introduction of the violet robe , Circuit judges usually wore a plain black gown and short wig ; this older tradition has been retained by the Central Criminal Court .

Judicial robes in the High Court of Justiciary are predominantly white and red , faced with red crosses over the white .
The white and red robe of the Lord Justice Clerk is differentiated by many small perforations in the white satin , through which the red cloth shows giving an ermine - like impression .
The Lord Justice General wears a red robe and hood ( without crosses ) edged in ermine ( black - spotted white fur ) .
Sheriffs ( who preside over Sheriff Courts ) wear the black gowns which they formerly used in practice ( silk gowns for QCs ; stuff gowns for advocates and solicitor - advocates ) , with falls in place of the bow - tie .
AUSTRALIA Section::::Australia .

In the Federal Court of Australia , judges no longer wear traditional court dress , but wear black wool robes with a black trim for ' first instance ' work , and black wool robes with a red trim for appeal cases .
These robes were adopted in 1997 and were designed by Bill Haycock .
The robes have seven horizontal tucks or " ombres " on one side , representing the six Australian States and the territories .
They also serve to symbolise Australia 's federal constitution and the federal jurisdiction of the Court .
The robes also include a vertical band of black silk made up of seven equal parts , also symbolizing Australia 's federal system and equality before the law .

District Court judges and lawyers maintained their robes .
In the Supreme Court Criminal Jurisdiction , traditional judges ' red robes were replaced with American - style plain black robes ; this also applied to all appeal courts .
Wigs were abolished in all Supreme Courts for both judges and lawyers .
This change was met with sadness by some members of the legal fraternity in the state , as it ended over 180 years of tradition in Western Australia .
In the High Court of Australia , barristers wear the same dress as is required by the Supreme Court in their jurisdiction .
For a matter heard in the Federal Court of Australia , barristers robe ( but without a wig ) if it is the usual practice to robe in the Supreme Court of the state or territory in which the matter is being heard .

GERMANY
Section::::Germany .
German court dress consists of a plain robe similar to the ones worn in the United States , normally without any kind of scarf or collar .

The colour of judges ' robes varies between different kinds of courts and branches of the judiciary .

Other branches of the judiciary ( labour , administrative and social ) use different colours of judges ' robes .
Hats are out of use at most German courts , with the exception of the Federal Constitutional Court , where they are still worn by the judges .

REPUBLIC OF IRELAND JUDICIARY Section::::Republic of Ireland .
Section::::Judiciary .
The Irish Free State , established in 1922 , continued largely with the courts and court system inherited from the United Kingdom , albeit pared down and shorn of some of its imperial grandeur .
To fit with the reorganization of the courts , the judiciary all but abandoned the wearing of their former ceremonial costumes .
Prior to Independence , the Lord Chancellor , Master of the Rolls and the Lords Justice of Appeal in Ireland would have worn full ceremonial dress identical to their English equivalents , viz .
long black damask robes with wide bands of gold lace and ornaments .
The Lord Chief Justice , Lord Chief Baron ( up to the extinction of the office on the retirement of Christopher Palles in 1916 ) and other puisne judges of the High Court would likewise have worn scarlet robes with ermine hood and ermine - trimmed mantle .
Many fine examples of these robes can be seen in portraits of Irish judges in the King 's Inns .
Upon the passing of the Constitution of the Irish Free State ( Saorstát Éireann ) Act 1922 , the office of Lord Chancellor immediately became defunct .
Then in 1924 the Court of Appeal was refashioned into the Supreme Court ; the Lord Chief Justice became simply Chief Justice and head of the judiciary ; and the Master of the Rolls was replaced with a President of the High Court .
The judges of the new superior courts , including the Chief Justice and President , adopted for all occasions — ceremonial or otherwise — the ordinary working judicial dress of the austere type previously worn by members of the old Court of Appeal , that is , as Order 119 rule 2 of the Rules of the Superior Courts , 1986 originally read : Judges of the Circuit Court also wear similar costume , pursuant to Order 3 rule 1 of the Circuit Court Rules , 2001 .
The prescribed dress of judges of the District Court ( in Order 5 rule 1 of the District Court Rules , 1997 ) is the same , but does not include a wig .
Order 119 rule 2 of the Rules of the Superior Courts was amended in 2012 , and now stipulates that : This new uniform is worn without a wig , and the single white neck tab is more reminiscent of European style court dress .
COUNSEL Section::::Counsel .
Barristers ' dress in Ireland is almost unchanged since the pre - Independence era .
Counsel may not exercise his right of audience unless he is properly attired .
It is provided in Order 119 rule 3 of the Rules of the Superior Courts as follows :
It may therefore be said that Irish barristers robe similarly to their English counterparts .
Such robes are worn by barristers in all courts , including the District Court .
Like Queen 's Counsel in England , Senior Counsel generally wear a short bar wig and black silk or poplin gown with flap collar and long , closed sleeves over a buttoned and broad - cuffed court coat .
Their shirts will have a detachable stiff wing collar , worn with bands .
Junior Counsel wear a short bar wig and black poplin or
stuff bar gown ( which has a gathered yoke and short , open sleeves ) over a dark three - piece suit with similar wing collar and bands .
While it is not unknown for female barristers to wear a blouse with separate bands much like male colleagues , more commonly they would wear a starched white all - in - one collarette or bib covering their neckline that approximates in looks to a tall Mandarin collar and bands .
Section 49 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 , however , did abolish the requirement that barristers should wear wigs in court .
To this extent only , the wording of the Rules of Court above is somewhat out of date .
( All counsel still must wear a gown and bands etc . )
By affording individual barristers a discretion to wear the forensic wig in court , the new rule defused what had become an increasingly bitter debate in the profession whether it was appropriate to cleave to anachronistic modes of dress - even as a traditional and undoubtedly recognizable uniform - and avoided a more drastic solution , such as the abandonment of wigs or gowns altogether .
Accordingly , there is little contemporary call for reform of court dress in Ireland .
CALL TO THE BAR Section::::Call to the Bar .
Junior counsel are called to the Bar in three sittings in the year , one in Hilary term , one Trinity term , and the other in Michaelmas term .
This ceremony takes place in the Supreme Court .
All new barristers habit themselves in full court working dress .
CALL TO THE INNER BAR Section::::Call to the Inner Bar .
Senior Counsel are appointed annually in the Call to the Inner Bar , a short ceremony in the Supreme Court towards the end of Michaelmas term .
( Junior counsel are members of the Outer or Utter Bar . )
On this occasion alone do the new Senior Counsel wear full - bottomed wigs , though with their working robes rather than with the breeches , stockings , patent court shoes and lace stock of former times .
This is purely a matter of convention and is not , so it would seem , governed by any rule of court .
Since 1922 , the Chief Justice has presided over the ceremony in lieu of the departed Lord Chancellor .
None has seen fit to alter the manner of the Call .
FAMILY LAW PROCEEDINGS Section::::Family law proceedings .

It is arguable that the Oireachtas intended the ban on " wigs and gowns " should be read liberally to mean that judges and barristers should appear in ordinary suits in these cases .
In practice , a literal interpretation of the rule has been preferred .
Judges and counsel do not wear either wig or gown in the family courts but will dutifully don the court coat ( if applicable ) and a wing collar and bands nonetheless .
Full court working dress remains worn in the Supreme Court in any proceedings , including those under the foregoing statutes .
SITTINGS OUTSIDE
THE LAW TERMS Section::::Sittings outside the law terms .
The Rules of Court oblige judges and barristers to wear court dress only " during the sittings " that is , during the four law terms of Michaelmas , Hilary , Easter and Trinity .
In any hearing during the vacations , judges and counsel wear ordinary suits .
SOLICITORS
Section::::Solicitors .
By virtue of Section 17 of the Courts Act 1971 , all solicitors have full rights of audience in the superior courts of Ireland .
When appearing as advocates , they wear ordinary suits and , unlike in England , are not required to wear gowns .
ISRAEL Section::::Israel .
Both Israeli judges and lawyers ( while appearing in court , especially in higher courts ) wear black robes , generally worn open to show a white shirt , black necktie , and dark trousers or skirts , and a dark jacket in the winter , or a similar outfit for women .
The robes and neckties may bear the logo of the Israel Bar Association .
( Out of court , many lawyers will wear a Bar Association pin in their jacket lapel . )
While the practice of lawyers wearing court dress is a legacy of the British Mandate that immediately preceded Israeli independence , the relatively simple outfit ( and lack of wigs ) shows American influence ; both nations ' systems of law have similarly influenced Israel 's .
ITALY Section::::Italy .
In Italy judges , prosecutors and lawyers wear black robes in higher courts or in criminal cases .
Judges and prosecutors wear red , ermine - lined robes with golden striped hats on solemn occasions such as the opening of the judicial year .
NETHERLANDS AND BELGIUM Section::::Netherlands and Belgium .
In the Netherlands and Belgium , judges , lawyers and prosecutors dress identically in the form of a black robe and a white band .
This is a symbolic act , as it is meant to convey the idea that the judge is merely the representative of Dutch or Belgian law , rather than an elevated individual with the power of sentencing people .
This idea finds its origins in the time of the French revolution .
However , there are some slight differences between the judge and the lawyer .
The judge wears a black robe , with silk ties on the sleeves and on the closure of the robe .
Lawyers just wear a simple black robe .
The higher the rank in court , the fancier the robe becomes ; the members of the ' Hoge Raad ' ( High Council ) wear a velvet black robe with ermine ties .
Previously , Dutch judges shared no common dress as the Spanish Netherlands and the Dutch Republic , as the Netherlands were highly decentralised with only provincial and urban law and no federal law .
Hence judges would dress as was the tradition in their own cities or towns .
SWEDEN Section::::Sweden .
In Sweden there is no official court dress for judges and judges do not wear gowns .
Judges usually wear an ordinary suit .
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA JUDICIAL COURT DRESS Section::::United States of America .
Section::::Judicial court dress .
During the early history of the United States , the court dress of judges and practicing lawyers closely mirrored British court dress of the 18th century ; both wore white powdered wigs and ( typically ) black robes in the lower courts , and in the higher ones , judges would wear red with black markings .
The practice fell out of favor and died out by the mid - nineteenth century .
Today , generally judges of both state and federal courts are free to select their own courtroom attire , although some jurisdictions do formally require judges to wear robes of some kind when presiding over hearings in court .
The most common choice is a plain black robe which covers the torso and legs , with sleeves .
Female judges will sometimes add to the robe a plain white collar or lace jabot .
Beneath the robes business attire is standard .
Typically judges pay for their own custom made judicial robe .
Until the tenure of Chief Justice John Marshall , all Supreme Court justices wore red robes with ermine trim and full - bottomed wigs , reminiscent of British court dress .
Marshall , however , eschewed this formality and began the practice of only wearing a black silk robe , with no wig .
In 1994 , Chief Justice William Rehnquist added four gold bars ( similar in appearance to captain insignia in the US Navy ) to each sleeve of his black robe , but the change in his attire ( he had been Chief Justice since 1986 ) was his own innovation and was inspired by a production of the operetta Iolanthe , rather than any historical precedent .
His successor , John G. Roberts , chose to stick with the traditional plain black robe .
Some Supreme Court justices ( including Clarence Thomas , the late Antonin Scalia , and Stephen Breyer , all of whom are or were balding ) maintain the ancient legal practice of wearing large black skullcaps , in their case when wearing their robes outdoors in cold weather ( for example , at presidential inaugurations in January . )
Many state supreme court justices wear unique styles of robes , the most notable being the Maryland Court of Appeals , where all judges wear red , and British - style tab collars .
The judges of the Delaware Superior Court continue to wear the red sashes or baldrics of their British predecessors , albeit now only on ceremonial occasions .
Some judges eschew special dress entirely and preside over their courts in normal business wear .
This is often seen among administrative law judges who preside over relatively informal administrative hearings .
ATTORNEY COURT DRESS Section::::Attorney court dress .
Lawyers wear normal business attire in courts of all levels .
During the second - wave feminism movement in the 1970s , some judges forbade female attorneys to wear trousers when appearing in court , but pantsuits are now widely accepted .
Like judges , American attorneys do not wear wigs .
Attorneys in Hawaii may be allowed to wear aloha shirts in court , though this varies among individual courts .
Until the 1970s , morning dress was required of all attorneys appearing before the United States Supreme Court by the Court 's rules .
Even after the Court abolished the requirement , the Office of the Solicitor General maintained the practice .
When the Solicitor General ( or any of the deputies ) appears before the U.S. Supreme Court , they wear morning dress , with striped trousers , grey ascot , waistcoat , and a cutaway morning coat .
A feminized version is sometimes worn by female deputies , which consists of the same garments tailored to female measurements .
Former Solicitor General Elena Kagan , the only woman to hold the office to date , appeared before the Court in pantsuits in lieu of morning dress .
The traditional female equivalent of morning dress , " softly flowing dresses with hats " , is strictly for social purposes and would be inappropriate attire for appearances before the nation 's highest court .
The Court 's Marshal and Clerk of both sexes also wear morning dress when the Court is in session .
