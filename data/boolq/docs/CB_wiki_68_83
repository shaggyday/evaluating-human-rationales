PRODUCTION Section::::Production .
After writing ( along with Keenen Ivory Wayans ) , producing , directing , and starring in his first film Hollywood Shuffle , Robert Townsend had attained near - cult status among independent filmmakers due to his dedication to that film ‚Äî a project which caused him to max out all his credit cards and spend nearly $ 100,000 of his own money raised through savings and various acting jobs in order to produce the film .
When writing Townsend 's first studio film
The Five Heartbeats , Townsend and Wayans kept comedy an important aspect of the film , but also explored complex characters in a more dramatic way .
The Five Heartbeats was originally set up as a development deal at Warner Bros. in 1988 , with Keenan Ivory Wayans , his brother Damon , and others tapped to star .
Warner passed on the project , and the Wayans moved on to develop and star in the Fox sketch comedy show In Living Color instead .
Townsend resurrected Heartbeats at 20th Century Fox in 1990 .
The original screenplay had been inspired by the lives and careers of Motown group
The Temptations , and Townsend had met with former lead singers David Ruffin and Eddie Kendrick with the intention of hiring them as technical advisors .
Fox vetoed bringing Ruffin and Kendrick onto the production , for fear that Motown founder Berry Gordy , Jr. might sue the studio .
Rhythm and blues - singing group The Dells , who were renowned for their four - decade career , became the technical advisors instead .
Townsend used his film to depict a similar story to the careers of the Temptations and the Dells , following the lives of three friends who aspire to musical stardom .
Given the setting of the film , he was able to tie in other elements , such as race relations , as well .
Due to the production 's budgetary constraints , Townsend used little - known actors of the time , with the exceptions of Leon Robinson , Diahann Carroll and Harold Nicholas of The Nicholas Brothers .
Townsend had considered Denzel Washington as Eddie King , Jr. and Whitney Houston as Baby Doll .
The former was not cast due to budget concerns and the latter passed on the role as it was felt to be too small .
PROMOTION Section::::Promotion .
To promote the film prior to its release , Townsend , along with the other actors who portrayed the fictional musical quartet
The Five Heartbeats ( Leon Robinson , Michael Wright , Harry J. Lennix , and Tico Wells ) performed in a concert with real - life Soul / R&B vocal group The Dells , one of many groups that inspired the film .
The Dells sang and recorded the vocals as the actors lip synced .
SOUNDTRACK Section::::Soundtrack .
A soundtrack for the film was released by Virgin Records , featuring original music by various artists .
Both " Nights like This " and " A Heart Is a House for Love " became top 20 hits on the U.S. Billboard Hot R&B Singles chart .
