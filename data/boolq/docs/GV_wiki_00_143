SCOTLAND
AT
THE FIFA WORLD CUP
This article is a record of Scotland 's results at the FIFA World Cup :
The FIFA World Cup , sometimes called the Football World Cup or the Soccer World Cup , but usually referred to simply as the World Cup , is an international association football competition contested by the men 's national teams of the members of Fédération Internationale de Football Association ( FIFA ) , the sport 's global governing body .
The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in 1930 , except in 1942 and 1946 , due to World War II .
The tournament consists of two parts , the qualification phase and the final phase ( officially called the World Cup Finals ) .
The qualification phase , which currently take place over the three years preceding the Finals , is used to determine which teams qualify for the Finals .
The current format of the Finals involves 32 teams competing for the title , at venues within the host nation ( or nations ) over a period of about a month .
The World Cup Finals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world , with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the 2006 tournament final .
The Scottish Football Association is the second oldest in the world , having been founded in 1873 .
Its foundation came the year after the first official international match was played between Scotland and England at Hamilton Crescent , Glasgow .
Scotland have played at eight FIFA World Cups , including five consecutive tournaments from 1974 to 1990 .
During the preparations for the 1928 Olympic Football Tournament , FIFA ruled that all its member associations must provide " broken - time " payments to cover the expenses of players from their country who participated .
In response to what they considered to be unacceptable interference , the football associations of Scotland , England , Ireland and Wales held a meeting at which they agreed to resign from FIFA .
As a result , Scotland did not compete in the three interwar World Cup competitions .
The Scottish Football Association did not rejoin FIFA as a permanent member until 1946 .
Scotland have never advanced beyond the first round of the finals competition .
They have missed out on progressing to the second round three times on goal difference : in 1974 , when Brazil edged them out ; in 1978 , when the Netherlands progressed ; and in 1982 , when the USSR went through .
Although Scotland have played at eight finals tournaments , they have qualified on nine occasions .
The Scottish Football Association declined to participate in 1950 as Scotland were not the British champions .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Scotland , like the other Home Nations , did not enter the three FIFA World Cups held during the 1930s .
This was because the four associations had been excluded from FIFA due to a disagreement regarding the status of amateur players .
The four associations , including Scotland , returned to the FIFA fold after the Second World War .
The readmission of the Scottish Football Association to FIFA meant that Scotland were now eligible to enter the 1950 FIFA World Cup .
FIFA advised that places would be awarded to the top two teams in the 1949–50 British Home Championship , but the SFA announced that Scotland would attend the finals only if Scotland won the competition .
Scotland won their first two matches , but a 1–0 home defeat by England meant that the Scots finished as runners - up .
The SFA stood by this proclamation , despite pleas to the contrary by the Scotland players , supported by England captain Billy Wright and the other England players .
Sportswriter Brian Glanville later described the SFA as showing " baffling insularity and pique " in their refusal to send a team to the World Cup .
1954
Section::::1954 .
The same qualification rules as in 1950 were in place for the 1954 FIFA World Cup , with the 1953–54 British Home Championship acting as a qualifying group .
Scotland again finished second , but this time the SFA allowed a team to participate in the Finals , held in Switzerland .
To quote the SFA website , " The preparation was atrocious " .
The SFA only sent 13 players to the finals , even though FIFA allowed 22-man squads at the tournament .
Despite this self - imposed hardship in terms of players , the SFA dignitaries travelled in numbers , accompanied with their wives .
Scotland lost 1–0 against Austria in their first game in the finals .
After falling out with the SFA , probably due to the poor preparation of the team , manager Andy Beattie resigned hours before the game against Uruguay .
Uruguay were reigning champions and had never before lost a game at the World Cup finals .
The gulf in class was exposed in horrific fashion as Uruguay won 7–0 .
1958
Section::::1958 .
Scotland qualified for the 1958 FIFA World Cup , finishing ahead of Spain .
Matt Busby had been due to manage the team at the World Cup , but the severe injuries he suffered in the Munich air disaster meant that trainer Dawson Walker took charge of the team instead .
In their first match at the finals Scotland achieved a creditable draw against Yugoslavia .
Players Archie Robertson and Tommy Docherty were sent to watch next opponents Paraguay and they reported back that Paraguay was a " rough , fit and good " team .
Walker chose to ignore this advice and left out some of his combative players , including Docherty , and Scotland lost 3–2 .
They exited the competition after also losing to France .
1974 Section::::1974 .
Scotland failed to qualify for another World Cup in the next 16 years .
A " skilful but fragile " team lost a play - off to Czechoslovakia in qualification for 1962 .
A team managed by Jock Stein , but deprived of many of its best players due to club commitments , lost a decisive qualifier against Italy in Naples for the 1966 tournament .
A narrow defeat by West Germany in Hamburg then ended hopes of qualifying for 1970 .
Willie Ormond was appointed Scotland manager in 1973 .
Ormond lost his first match in charge 5–0 to England , but recovered to steer Scotland to their first World Cup finals in 16 years in 1974 .
At the 1974 World Cup finals in West Germany , Scotland achieved their most impressive performance at a World Cup tournament .
The team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference .
After beating Zaire , they drew with both Brazil and Yugoslavia , and went out because they had beaten Zaire by the smallest margin .
This performance has been assessed as a " gallant failure " , but the choice to retain possession instead of pressing for more goals against Zaire has been criticised .
1978
Section::::1978 .
Scotland appointed Ally MacLeod as manager in 1977 .
Scotland qualified for the 1978 FIFA World Cup with victories over Czechoslovakia and Wales .
During the build - up to the tournament , MacLeod fuelled the hopes of the nation by stating that Scotland would come home from Argentina with a medal .
As the squad left for the finals , they were given an enthusiastic send off as they were paraded around a packed Hampden Park .
Thousands more fans lined the route to Prestwick Airport as the team set off for South America .
This enthusiasm was not just generated internally , as respected coaches such as Rinus Michels and Miljan Miljanić rated Scotland amongst the favourites to win the competition .
The Royal Mail commissioned designs of commemorative stamps that would have been circulated if Scotland had won the World Cup .
Scotland 's first game was against Peru in Córdoba .
Two spectacular goals by Teófilo Cubillas meant that the result was a 3–1 loss .
The second game was a very disappointing 1–1 draw against Iran .
Scotland had not even scouted Iran .
The disconsolate mood of the nation was reflected by footage of Ally MacLeod in the dugout with his head in his hands .
MacLeod had made strange selection choices , picking inexperienced full - backs and retaining the out - of - form Bruce Rioch and Don Masson .
After taking a single point from their opening two games , Scotland had to defeat the Netherlands by three clear goals to progress .
Despite the Dutch taking the lead , Scotland fought back to win 3–2 with a goal from Kenny Dalglish and two from Archie Gemmill , the second of which is considered one of the greatest World Cup goals ever ; Gemmill beat three Dutch defenders before lifting the ball over goalkeeper Jan Jongbloed into the net .
The victory was not sufficient to secure a place in the second round , however , as Scotland were eliminated on goal difference for the second successive World Cup .
This performance against strong opponents only heightened the frustration at the poor results earlier in the competition .
MacLeod initially retained his position , but resigned later that year .
1982
Section::::1982 .
Jock Stein , who had won nine consecutive Scottish league titles and the European Cup as manager of Celtic , was appointed Scotland manager in 1978 .
After failing to qualify for the 1980 European Championship , Scotland qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup from a tough group including Sweden , Portugal , Israel and Northern Ireland , losing just one match in the process .
They were then drawn in a " Group of death " with New Zealand , Brazil and the Soviet Union .
Scotland beat New Zealand by 5–2 in their first game , but then lost 4–1 to a Brazil team containing Socrates , Zico , Eder and Falcão .
Scotland were again eliminated on goal difference , after a 2–2 draw with the Soviet Union .
This match is best remembered for defenders Alan Hansen and Willie Miller colliding while chasing a long ball , which allowed the Soviets to run through and score .
1986 Section::::1986 .
Scotland qualified for the 1986 FIFA World Cup , their fourth in succession , in traumatic circumstances .
The squad went into their last qualification match against Wales needing a point to progress to a qualifying playoff against Australia .
With only nine minutes remaining and Wales leading 1–0 , Scotland were awarded a penalty kick , which was calmly scored by Davie Cooper .
The 1–1 draw meant that Scotland progressed , but as the players and fans celebrated , national coach Jock Stein suffered a heart attack and died shortly afterwards .
His assistant Alex Ferguson took over .
Scotland qualified by winning 2–0 against Australia in a two - leg playoff , but were again drawn into a group of death , this time with Uruguay , Denmark and West Germany .
Scotland were eliminated from the tournament with just one point from their three matches , a goalless draw with Uruguay .
1990 Section::::1990 .
Scotland qualified for their fifth consecutive World Cup in 1990 by finishing second in their qualifying group , ahead of France .
Scotland were drawn in a group with Costa Rica , Sweden , and Brazil , but the Scots lost 1–0 to Costa Rica .
While they recovered to beat Sweden 2–1 in their second game , they lost to Brazil in their third match 1–0 and were once again eliminated after the first round .
Goalkeeper Jim Leighton fumbled a shot that allowed Brazil to score the only goal .
1998
Section::::1998 .
Craig Brown guided Scotland to qualification for the 1998 FIFA World Cup , finishing as the best runners - up .
Scotland were drawn against holders Brazil in the opening game of the World Cup .
John Collins scored from the penalty spot to level the score at 1–1 , but a Tom Boyd own goal led to a 2–1 defeat .
Scotland drew their next game 1–1 with Norway in Bordeaux , but the final match against Morocco ended in a 3–0 defeat .
Scotland have not appeared at the World Cup since .
