ALASKA PERMANENT FUND
The Alaska Permanent Fund is a constitutionally established permanent fund managed by a state - owned corporation , the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation ( APFC ) .
It was established in Alaska in 1976 by Article 9 , Section 15 of the Alaska State Constitution under Governor Jay Hammond .
From February 1976 until April 1980 , the Department of Revenue Treasury Division managed the state 's Permanent Fund assets , until , in 1980 , the Alaska State Legislature created the APFC .
As of the end of 2016 , the fund is worth nearly $ 55 billion that has been funded by oil revenues .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Shortly after the oil from Alaska 's North Slope began flowing to market through the Trans - Alaska Pipeline System , the Permanent Fund was created by an amendment to the Alaska Constitution .
It was designed to be an investment where at least 25 % of the oil money would be put into a dedicated fund for future generations , who would no longer have oil as a resource .
This does not mean the fund is solely funded by oil revenue .
The Fund includes neither property taxes on oil company property nor income tax from oil corporations , so the minimum 25 % deposit is closer to 11 % if those sources were also considered .
The Alaska Permanent Fund sets aside a certain share of oil revenues to continue benefiting current and all future generations of Alaskans .
Many citizens also believed that the legislature too quickly and too inefficiently spent the $ 900 million bonus the state got in 1969 after leasing out the oil fields .
This belief spurred a desire to put some oil revenues out of direct political control .
The Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation manages the assets of both the Permanent Fund and other state investments , but spending Fund income is up to the Legislature .
The Corporation is to manage for maximum prudent return , and not — as some Alaskans at first wanted — as a development bank for in - state projects .
The Fund grew from an initial investment of $ 734,000 in 1977 to approximately $ 53.7 billion as of July 9 , 2015 .
Some growth was due to good management , some to inflationary re - investment , and some via legislative decisions to deposit extra income during boom years .
Each year , the fund 's realized earnings are split between inflation - proofing , operating expenses , and the annual Permanent Fund Dividend .
The fund is a member of the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds and has therefore signed up to the Santiago Principles on best practice in managing sovereign wealth funds .
The Fund 's current chief investment officer is Marcus Framption .

The Permanent Fund Dividend [ PFD ] is a dividend paid to Alaska residents that have lived within the state for a full calendar year ( January 1 – December 31 ) , and intend to remain an Alaska resident indefinitely .
This means if residency is taken on January 2 , the " calendar year " would n't start until next January 1 .
However , an individual is not eligible for a PFD for a dividend year when : The amount of each payment is based upon a five - year average of the Permanent Fund 's performance and varies widely depending on the stock market and many other factors .
The PFD is calculated by the following steps :
* Add Fund Statutory Net Income from the current plus the previous four fiscal years .
*
* Multiply by 21 % *
* Divide by 2 * * Subtract prior year obligations , expenses and PFD program operations
*
* Divide by the number of eligible applicants *
The lowest individual dividend payout was $ 331.29 in 1984 and the highest was $ 2,072 in 2015 .
However , in 2008 Governor Sarah Palin signed Senate Bill 4002 that used revenues generated from the state 's natural resources and provided a one - time special payment of $ 1,200 to every Alaskan eligible for the PFD .
Although the principal or corpus of the Fund is constitutionally protected , income earned by the Fund , like nearly all State income , is constitutionally defined as general fund money .
The first dividend plan would have paid Alaskans $ 50 for each year of residency up to 20 years , but the U.S. Supreme Court in disapproved the $ 50 per year formula as an invidious distinction burdening interstate travel .
As a result , each qualified resident now receives the same annual amount , regardless of age or years of residency .
Payments from the fund are subject to federal income tax .
Alaska has no state income tax , but part - year residents who leave the state may be taxed on them by their new state of residence .

CONSTITUTIONAL BUDGET RESERVE ( CBR ) Section::::Constitutional Budget Reserve ( CBR ) .
The Constitutional Budget Reserve is a companion fund to the Permanent Fund which was established in 1991 to ease problems from the variability of oil revenue , which vary depending upon the price of oil in the market .
Deposits into the CBR consist of settlements of back taxes and other revenues owed to the state .
Draws from the CBR into the general fund require a 3/4 vote of each house of the legislature and must be repaid .
To date , the general fund has amassed a debt of approximately $ 4 billion to the CBR to maintain a stable level of public spending .
ISSUES WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL BUDGET RESERVE Section::::Issues with the Constitutional Budget Reserve .
The size of the debt owed to the CBR has raised doubts over repayment .
The CBR is based on the assumption that the general fund deficit will remain constant over time ( allowing paybacks to balance draws ) .
Believing this to be mistaken , critics allege the state uses resources from the CBR to avoid reducing the budget , acknowledging debt , or increasing taxes .
According to them , falling oil revenues and growing spending requirements will leave paybacks consistently lower than draws , causing the CBR to fail .
Former state senator Dave Donley ( R - Anchorage ) recognized that the high vote requirement to spend CBR money ( ¾ of each house ) had a perverse and unintended consequence .
The high vote requirement was meant to ensure that draws from the CBR would be rare , but in fact such draws are common .
Donley explained that the high vote requirement really empowers the minority party ( in the 2000–07 era , the Democratic Party ) , who can then get what they want in a Christmas tree bill ( presents for everyone , both majority and minority ) in exchange for their votes ( which minority votes would not be needed with the usual 51 % voting rule ) .
Donley thus explains why both parties can and do use the higher voting rule requirement to more frequently spend from the CBR .
ISSUES WITH THE PERMANENT FUND DIVIDENDS AND SPENDING Section::::Issues with the Permanent Fund .
Section::::Dividends and spending .
While the Permanent Fund generally generated large surpluses even after payment of the Dividend [ PFD ] , the state general fund operated at a substantial deficit .
However , the consolidated account of both General and Permanent Funds usually shows a surplus .
The Funds ' ultimate uses were never clearly spelled out at its inception , leaving no current consensus over what role Fund earning should play in the current and expected state budget shortfalls .
However , some people argue that the original intent was to fund state government after the temporary oil riches ceased , while others note that the Fund 's intent changed from its 1976 origin when in 1982 the Dividend program began .
Public opinion strongly favors the Dividend program .
Indeed , in 1999 , with oil prices going as low as $ 9 per barrel and Alaska 's oil consultant Daniel Yergin forecasting low prices " for the foreseeable future " , the State put an advisory vote before Alaskans , asking if government could spend " some " part of Permanent Fund earning for government purposes .
Gov. Knowles , Lt .
Gov. Ulmer , and many other elected officials urged a " yes " vote .
Campaign spending greatly favored the " yes " side .
The public voted " no " by nearly 84 % .
( Oil prices rose dramatically , starting about two weeks after Yergin 's prediction , to above $ 60 per barrel , though the quantity produced continues to fall . )
Perceived support of the dividend program is so universally strong that it ensures the dividend 's continuity and the protection of the Fund 's principal , since any measure characterized as negatively impacting dividend payouts represents a loss to the entire populace .
That is , legislators willing to appropriate the Fund 's annual earnings are constrained by the politically suicidal nature of any decrease in the public 's dividend .
PERCENT OF MARKET VALUE ( POMV )
PROPOSAL
Section::::Percent of Market Value ( POMV ) Proposal .
In 2000 , the APFC Board of Trustees proposed changing the Permanent Fund 's management system to a Percent of Market Value ( PoMV ) approach which would require an amendment to the state constitution .
The PoMV proposal would limit withdrawals to five percent of the fund 's value each year , to be spent at the discretion of the Legislature .
Currently the Legislature has authority to appropriate all of the fund 's realized earnings .
Tentative , unapproved proposals indicate that half of this five percent withdrawal would go to the dividend and half to government spending — but POMV died in the Legislature because most there saw POMV as unambiguously tied to such politically unpopular spending proposals .
Most Alaskans ( 84 % in 1999 ) disapprove of allowing the government to tamper with the fund , especially if that means government might spend Fund income .
Again in 2015–2017 , a POMV approach was considered .
The market price for North Slope oil fell from an average $ 107.57 per barrel in FY2014 to $ 50.05 per barrel in FY2017 .
This price shift caused an 80 percent decline in state revenue and resulted in a multibillion - dollar budget gap .
Both bodies of the legislature have passed a bill that provides for an annual draw of 5.25 % of the average balance of the Permanent Fund ( average of the first 5 of the last six years ) .
Since the formula is based on an average , rather than a single year , the effective draw is only about 4.2%—enough to preserve the real value of the fund considering that the fund has returned close to 9 % annually .
The legislature carefully vetted this percentage over the course of two sessions and has come to a consensus .
This draw is projected to produce $ 2.7 billion in FY2019 and grow with the balance of the Permanent Fund .
The major point of disagreement , however , is the size of the dividend : The House of Representatives version of the bill uses 5.25 % draw for government ( 33 % of for Dividends and 67 % for government services ) and an additional 0.25 % draw for Permanent Fund inflation proofing .
This produces $ 2.7 billion ( $ 1.8 billion for government use , net of a $ 900.9 million dividend — about $ 1,250.00 per Alaskan — growing with the value of the fund ) .
The Senate version of the bill uses the same 5.25 % draw as the House , but directs only 25 % of the draw to dividends .
This produces the same $ 2.7 billion but government services receive $ 2.0 billion while the dividend receives just under $ 700 million — about $ 1,000.00 per person — growing with the value of the fund .
Oil revenues are forecast ( by the state Department of Revenue ) to remain stagnant through FY2027 , and traditional budget reserves may be empty by FY2019 but with a Permanent Fund value in excess of $ 60.0 billion , the budget gap can be reduced significantly .
Since this POMV proposal does not close the gap entirely , members of the legislature are considering a tax bill as well .
IMPACT
Section::::Impact .
A 2018 paper found that the Alaska Permanent Fund " dividend had no effect on employment , and increased part - time work by 1.8 percentage points ( 17 percent ) ...
our results suggest that a universal and permanent cash transfer does not significantly decrease aggregate employment . "
