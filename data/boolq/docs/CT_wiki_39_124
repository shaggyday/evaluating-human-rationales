STRIKE PAY Strike pay is payments made by a trade union to workers who are on strike as help in meeting their basic needs while on strike , often out of a special reserve known as a strike fund .
Union workers reason that the availability of strike pay increases their leverage at the bargaining table and actually decreases the probability of a strike , since the employers are aware that their employees have this financial resource available to them if they choose to strike .
IN THE UNITED KINGDOM Section::::In the United Kingdom .
Whilst some trade unions make payments to members who are on an official strike there is no requirement to do so .
The UK government makes the presumption that workers on official strike action are being paid strike pay , and so they may not be entitled to state benefits .
STRIKE FUND Section::::Strike fund .
A strike fund is a reserve set up by a union ahead of time ( through special assessments or from general funds ) and used to provide strike pay or for other strike - related activities .
