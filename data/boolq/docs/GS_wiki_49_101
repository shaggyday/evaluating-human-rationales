DELAYED GRIEF
The terms delayed grief and unresolved grief are variations of grieving after a loss .
The meaning of unresolved grief is any aspect of grieving that has yet to be resolved .
In cases of delayed grief , the reaction to the loss is postponed until a later time , even years later , and might be triggered by a seemingly unrelated event , such as a recent divorce or even the death of a pet , but with reactions excessive to the current situation .
The delayed grief might manifest as any of the reactions in normal grief : pangs of intense yearning , spasms of distress , short bouts of hysterical laughter , tearful or uncontrolled sobbing , feeling of hopelessness , restlessness , insomnia , preoccupation with thoughts about the loved one , extreme and unexplained anger , or general feelings of depression .
In extreme cases reaction may invoke suicidal tendencies .
The term " delayed grief " is also used to describe a pattern in which symptoms of distress , seeking , yearning ( etc . ) , are occurring at a much later time period than is typical .
Delayed grief refers to any reaction that occurs later than usual , as a delayed onset of symptoms .
Contrast to the term " complicated grief " as meaning a form of grieving that spans years ( see full description at : Grief ) .
