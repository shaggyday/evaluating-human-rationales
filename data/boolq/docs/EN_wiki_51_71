BREAST CYST
A breast cyst is a fluid - filled sac within the breast .
One breast can have one or more breast cysts .
They are often described as round or oval lumps with distinct edges .
In texture , a breast cyst usually feels like a soft grape or a water - filled balloon , but sometimes a breast cyst feels firm .
Breast cysts can be painful and may be worrisome but are generally benign .
They are most common in pre - menopausal women in their 30s or 40s .
They usually disappear after menopause , but may persist or reappear when using hormone therapy .
They are also common in adolescents .
Breast cysts can be part of fibrocystic disease .
The pain and swelling is usually worse in the second half of the menstrual cycle or during pregnancy .
Treating breast cysts is usually not necessary unless they are painful or cause discomfort .
In most cases , the discomfort they cause may be alleviated by draining the fluid from the cyst .
The cysts form as a result of the growth of the milk glands and their size may range from smaller than a pea to larger than a ping pong ball .
Small cysts can not be felt during a physical examination , and some large cysts feel like lumps .
However , most cysts , regardless of their size can not be identified during physical exams .
Breast cysts are not to be confused with " milk cysts " ( galactoceles ) , which usually appear during weaning .
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Section::::Signs and symptoms .
Signs and symptoms of breast cysts include : *
A smooth , easily movable round or oval breast lump with distinct edges
* Breast pain or tenderness in the area of the lump * Increased lump size and tenderness just before menstruation * Decreased lump size and resolution of other signs and symptoms after menstruation
* Having one or many simple breast cysts does not increase a person 's risk of breast cancer .
Lumps in the breast are often not found during self - examinations or physical exams .
However , in some cases they can be felt at touch , especially if they are larger .
Breasts are usually lumpy or nodular as a result of the hormonal changes that women go through during their menstrual cycle .
However , new breast lumps should always be referred to a specialist .
Fluid leaking from a cyst , as may happen due to puncture or vigorous compression during mammography , or due to seatbelt injury in the course of an automobile accident , may trigger an aseptic inflammation in the surrounding breast tissue .
DIAGNOSIS Section::::Diagnosis .
The cystic nature of a breast lump can be confirmed by ultrasound examination , aspiration ( removal of contents with needle ) , or mammogram .
Ultrasound can also show if the cyst contains solid nodules , a sign that the lesion may be pre - cancerous or cancerous .
Examination by a cytopathologist of the fluid aspirated from the cyst may also help with this diagnosis .
In particular , it should be sent to a laboratory for testing if it is blood - stained .
Commonly , cysts are detected with the help of mammograms .
However , the medical history and physical examination also play an important role in establishing an accurate diagnosis .
During these tests , the doctor will try to find out as much information as possible regarding the symptoms the patient has experienced , their intensity and duration and the physical examination is performed regularly to check for other abnormalities that may exist within the breast .
As mentioned above , cysts are often undetectable at touch .
Therefore , a mammogram can provide valuable and clear images of the breast tissue .
Generally , if there is any abnormality within the breast tissue , it will be shown on the mammogram .
There are two types of mammograms available .
One of them is primarily used in screening , and are ordered for patients who do not show any symptoms and these are called screening mammograms .
Diagnostic mammograms are used on patients who developed certain symptoms of a breast condition or in patients whose screening mammograms showed abnormalities .
Patients suspected of breast cysts will normally be given a diagnosing mammogram , although they are not suspected of cancer .
This type of mammogram provides the doctor with the possibility of performing a breast ultrasound at the same time and this is the reason why they are often preferred over the screening mammograms .
Breast ultrasound is considered the best option when diagnosing breast cysts because it is 95 to 100 % accurate , it provides a clear image on the cyst 's appearance ( simple or complex ) and it may also distinguish between solid lumps and fluid - filled cysts , which a mammogram can not do .
Breast ultrasounds are performed with the help of a handheld medical instrument which is placed on the skin , after a special type of fluid has been applied on it .
The instruments picks up the echo resulted from the sound waves it sends to the breast .
These echoes are transmitted to a computer which translates it into a picture .
Breast cysts may remain stable for many years or may resolve spontaneously .
Most simple cysts are benign and do not require any treatment or further diagnostic workup .
Some complex cysts may require further diagnostic measures such as fine needle aspiration or biopsy to exclude breast cancer however the overwhelming majority is of benign nature .
Aspiration
both diagnoses and removes cysts at the same time .
That is , cysts will usually resolve on their own after the fluid is drained .
Otherwise , if the lump is not a cyst , the fluid aspirated may contain blood or there may not be fluid at all .
Whereas in the first case , the fluid is sent to the laboratory for further examination , the latter circumstance is a sign that the breast lump is solid .
This type of tumor needs to be biopsied in order to determine whether it is malignant or benign .
PREVENTION Section::::Prevention .
The development of breast cysts may be prevented to some degree , according to the majority of the specialists .
The recommended measures one is able to take in order to avoid the formation of the cysts include practicing good health and avoiding certain medications , eating a balanced diet , taking necessary vitamins and supplements , getting exercise , and avoiding stress .
Although caffeine consumption does not have a scientifically proved connection with the process of cyst development , many women claim that their symptoms are relieved if avoiding it .
Some doctors recommend reducing the amount of caffeine in one 's diet in terms of both beverages and foods ( such as chocolate ) .
Also reducing salt intake may help in alleviating the symptoms of breast cysts , although , again , there is no scientific linkage between these two .
Excessive sugar consumption as well as undetected food allergies , such as to gluten or lactose , may also contribute to cyst development .
TREATMENT Section::::Treatment .
Breast cysts do not require treatment unless a cyst is large and painful or otherwise uncomfortable .
In that case , draining the fluid from a breast cyst can ease symptoms .
Typical treatment involves a Needle aspiration biopsy .
Aspirated cysts often recur ( come back ) ; definitive treatment may require surgery .
Draining the fluid and then waiting for the cyst to resolve is the main treatment applied in these cases .
Moreover , if cysts are aspirated and the fluid looks normal , they do not require any other medical attention apart from following - up to make sure they have completely disappeared .
Hormone therapy , by the means of oral contraceptives , is sometimes prescribed to reduce their recurrence and to regulate the menstrual cycle of the patient ( which is likely to cause them in the first place ) .
Danazol may also be prescribed to treat this condition and it is usually considered in patients on whom the non - medical treatment fails and the symptoms are intense .
Surgical removal of a breast cyst is necessary only in a few unusual circumstances .
If an uncomfortable breast cyst recurs month after month , or if a breast cyst contains blood - tinged fluid and displays other worrisome signs , surgery may be considered .
EPIDEMIOLOGY Section::::Epidemiology .
It is estimated that 7 % of women in the western world develop palpable breast cysts .
There is preliminary evidence that women with breast cysts may be at an increased risk of breast cancer , especially at younger ages .
In males , the occurrence of breast cysts is rare and may ( but need not ) be an indication of malignancy .
CYSTS AND BRA SUPPORT Section::::Cysts and bra support .
Some women experience breast pain , especially when engaging in vigorous physical activity .
A properly fitted sports bra , which compresses or encapsulates breast tissue , is designed to reduce pain caused by exercise .
