PENALTY SHOOT - OUT ( ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL )
A penalty shoot - out ( officially kicks from the penalty mark ) is a method of determining which team is awarded victory in an association football match that can not end in a draw , when the score is tied after the regulation playing time as well as extra time ( if used ) have expired .
In a penalty shoot - out , each team takes turns shooting at goal from the penalty mark , with the goal only defended by the opposing team 's goalkeeper .
Each team has five shots which must be taken by different kickers ; the team that makes more successful kicks is declared the victor .
Shoot - outs finish as soon as one team has an insurmountable lead .
If scores are level after five pairs of shots , the shootout progresses into additional " sudden - death " rounds .
Balls successfully kicked into the goal during a shoot - out do not count as goals for the individual kickers or the team , and are tallied separately from the goals scored during normal play ( including extra time , if any ) .
Although the procedure for each individual kick in the shoot - out resembles that of a penalty kick , there are some differences .
Most notably , neither the kicker nor any player other than the goalkeeper may play the ball again once it has been kicked .
The penalty shoot - out is one of the three methods of breaking a draw that are currently approved by the Laws of the Game ; the others are extra time and , for two - legged ties , the away goals rule .
A shoot - out is usually used only after one or more of the other methods fail to produce a winner .
The method of breaking a draw for a specific match is determined beforehand by the match organizing body .
In most professional level competitions , two 15-minute extra time periods are played if the score is tied at the end of regulation time , and a shoot - out is held if the score is still tied after the extra time periods .
Although widely employed in football since the 1970s , penalty shoot - outs are disliked by many followers of the game , due primarily to their perceived reliance on luck rather than skill and their dependence on individual duels between opposing players , which is arguably not in keeping with football as a team sport .
Conversely , some believe the pressure and unpredictability involved makes it one of the most thrilling finales to any sport .
OVERVIEW Section::::Overview .
During a shoot - out , coaches and players other than the kicker and the goalkeepers must remain in the centre circle .
The kicking team 's goalkeeper stands at the intersection of the goal line and the line marking the penalty area ( ) near one of the assistant referees .
Goals scored during the shoot - out are not commonly added to the goalscoring records of the players involved .
A draw is a common result in football .
Shoot - outs are only used in competitions that require a match - winner at the end of the game – this is predominantly in knockout " cup " ties , as opposed to round - robin " leagues " ; they decide which team progresses to the next round of a tournament , or win it .
Usually extra time has been played first , but this is not necessary ; exceptions include the Copa Libertadores , Copa América ( quarter - finals and semi - finals only ) , FA Community Shield and the Football League Trophy , all of which use shoot - outs straight after the end of normal time .
Exceptionally , a shoot - out after a league or round - robin match may be provided for .
This provision appears for occasions where opposing teams in a final - day match finish the group with identical records , which can result in an immediate shoot - out .
This happened in Group A of the 2003 UEFA Women 's Under-19 Championship .
This rule is a recent innovation , and for example did not apply in Group F of the 1990 World Cup , where the Republic of Ireland and the Netherlands were separated by drawing of lots immediately after finishing their final - day match in a draw .
Several leagues , such as the J.League , have experimented with penalty shoot - outs immediately following a drawn league match , with the winner being awarded an extra point .
In the United States and Canada , Major League Soccer initially also had a shoot - out immediately following the end of full - time , even during league matches , although these shoot - outs differed from standard penalty shoot - outs ( see below ) .
A team that loses a penalty shoot - out is eliminated from the tournament but it does not count as a defeat , while the winning team in the shoot - out advances but does not get a match victory .
For instance , the Netherlands are considered to have concluded the 2014 FIFA World Cup undefeated , despite being eliminated at the semi - final stage .
PROCEDURE Section::::Procedure .
The following is a summary of the procedure for kicks from the penalty mark .
The procedure is specified in Law 10 ( " Determining the Outcome of a Match " ) of the IFAB 's Laws of the Game document ( p. 71 ) .
*
The referee tosses a coin to decide the goal at which the kicks will be taken .
The choice of goal by the coin toss winner may only be changed by the referee for safety reasons or if the goal or playing surface becomes unusable .
*
* The referee tosses the coin a second time to determine which team will take the first kick .
*
* All players other than the kicker and the goalkeepers must remain in the pitch 's centre circle ( see above ) .
*
* Each kick will be taken in the general manner of a penalty kick .
Each kick will be taken from the penalty mark , which is from the goal line and equidistant from each touch line , with the goal defended only by the opposing goalkeeper .
The goalkeeper must remain between the goal posts on his goal line until the ball has been kicked , although he can jump in place , wave his arms , move side to side along the goal line or otherwise try to distract the shooter .
*
*
Each team is responsible for selecting from the eligible players the order in which they will take the kicks .
*
* Each kicker can kick the ball only once .
Once kicked , the kicker may not play the ball again .
The decision on a rekick is solely at the referee 's discretion .
*
* No other player on either team , other than the designated kicker and goalkeeper , may touch the ball .
*
* A kick is successful if , having been touched once by the kicker , the ball crosses the goal line between the goal posts and under the crossbar , without touching any player , official , or outside agent other than the defending goalkeeper .
The ball may touch the goalkeeper , goal posts , or crossbar any number of times before going into the goal as long as the referee believes the ball 's motion is the result of the initial kick .
This was clarified after an incident in the 1986 World Cup shoot - out between Brazil and France .
Bruno Bellone 's kick rebounded out off the post , hit goalkeeper Carlos 's back , and subsequently bounced into the goal .
Referee Ioan Igna gave the goal to France , and Brazil captain Edinho was booked for protesting that the kick should have been considered a miss as soon as it rebounded off the post .
In 1987 , the International Football Association Board clarified Law 14 , covering penalty kicks , to support Igna 's decision .
*
* Teams take turns to kick from the penalty mark until each has taken five kicks .
However , if one side has scored more successful kicks than the other could possibly reach with all of its remaining kicks , the shoot - out immediately ends , regardless of the number of kicks remaining ; this basis is called " best of five kicks " .
An example of this is the 2006 World Cup final , the shootout ended after Italy 's Fabio Grosso had scored his teams fifth , despite the fact that France ( on 3 ) still had one more to go .
*
*
If at the end of these five rounds of kicks the teams have scored an equal number of successful kicks , additional rounds of one kick each will be used until the tie is broken ; this is known as sudden death .
*
* The team that scores the most successful kicks at the end of the shoot - out will be the winner of the match .
* * Only players who were on the pitch at the end of play or temporarily absent ( injured , adjusting equipment etc . ) will be allowed to participate in the shoot - out .
If at the end of the match and before or during the kicks one side has more players on the pitch than the other , whether as a result of injury or red cards , then the side with more players must reduce its numbers to match the opponents ; this is known as ' reduce to equate ' .
For example , if Team A has 11 players but Team B only has 10 , then Team A will choose one player who will not take part .
Players excluded this way normally take no further part in the procedure , except that they can be used to replace an injured goalkeeper .
The rule was introduced by the International Football Association Board in February 2000 because previously an eleventh kick would be taken by the eleventh ( i.e. weakest ) player of a full - strength team and the first ( i.e. strongest ) player of a sub - strength team .
A rule change in 2016 eliminated the possibility of a team gaining such an advantage if a player is injured or sent off during the shoot - out .
* * A team may replace a goalkeeper who becomes injured during the shoot - out with a substitute ( provided the team has not already used the maximum number of substitutes allowed by the competition ) or by a player previously excluded under the ' reduce to equate ' provision .
*
* If a goalkeeper is sent off during the shoot - out , another player who finished the game must act as goalkeeper .
*
*
If a player , other than the goalkeeper , becomes injured or is sent off during the shoot - out , then the shoot - out will continue with no substitution allowed .
The opposing team must reduce its numbers accordingly .
* * Any player remaining on the pitch may act as the goalkeeper , and it is not required for the same player to have acted as a goalkeeper during the game .
*
* No player will be allowed to take a second kick until all other eligible players on their team have taken a first kick , including the goalkeeper .
*
* If it becomes necessary for players to take another kick ( because the score has remained equal after all eligible players have taken their first kick ) , players are not required to kick in the same order .
*
* Kicks from the penalty mark must not be delayed for a player who leaves the field of play .
The player 's kick will be forfeited ( not scored ) if the player does not return in time to take a kick .
*
* The referee must not abandon the match if , during the kicks , a team is reduced to fewer than seven players .
* TACTICS Section::::Tactics .
Defending against a penalty kick is one of the most difficult tasks a goalkeeper can face .
Some decide which way they will dive beforehand , giving themselves time to reach the side of the goalmouth .
A 2011 study published in the journal Psychological Science found goalkeepers dived to the right 71 % of the time when their team was losing , but only 48 % when ahead and 49 % when tied , a phenomenon believed to be related to certain right - preferring behaviour in social mammals .
Others try to read the kicker 's motion pattern .
Kickers may attempt to feint , or delay their shot to see which way the keeper dives .
Shooting high and centre , in the space that the keeper will evacuate , carries the highest risk of shooting above the bar .
If a keeper blocks a penalty kick during a match , there is a danger the kicker or a teammate may score from the rebound ; this is not relevant in the case of a shoot - out .
Since the entire shoot - out is conducted at the same goal , the crowd behind the goal may favour one team and try to distract the other team 's shooters .
To forestall any potential advantage , in 2016 the Laws of the Game were modified to add a coin toss between the two teams prior to the shoot - out : the winner of the coin toss has the right to decide which goal is used for the shoot - out
( previously , the decision was at the referee 's discretion ) .
The referee may change the goal only for safety reasons or if the selected goal or pitch are unusable .
A goalkeeper may not use distracting gamesmanship such as cleaning his boots or asking the referee to see if the ball is placed properly ; this risks a caution for unsporting conduct .
Bruce Grobbelaar 's " wobbly legs " clowning distracted Francesco Graziani in the 1984 European Cup Final shootout .
The keeper is forbidden from moving off the goal line to narrow the shooter 's angle ; the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final shootout caused controversy as replays showed that both keepers got away with this , as did Jerzy Dudek in the 2005 Champions League Final .
HISTORY ORIGINS Section::::History .
Section::::Origins .
Before the introduction of shoot - outs , knock - out matches level after extra time would be decided by a replay or a coin toss .
However , variants of the modern shoot - out were used before then in several domestic competitions and minor tournaments .
Domestic examples include the Yugoslav Cup from 1952 , the Coppa Italia from 1958–59 , and the Swiss inter - regional Youth Cup from 1959–60 .
International examples include the 1962 Uhrencup ( at the suggestion of its founder Kurt Weissbrodt ) , the final of the 1962 Ramón de Carranza Trophy ( at the suggestion of journalist Rafael Ballester ) , and a silver medal playoff match between amateur teams representing Venezuela and Bolivia in the 1965 Bolivarian Games .
In major competitions , when a replay or playoff was not possible , ties were previously broken by drawing of lots .
Examples include Italy 's win over the USSR in the semi - final of the 1968 European Championship ( the final , also drawn , went to a replay ) .
Israeli Yosef Dagan is credited with originating the modern shoot - out , after watching the Israeli team lose a 1968 Olympic quarterfinal game against Bulgaria by drawing of lots in Mexico .
Michael Almog , later president of the Israel FA , described Dagan 's proposal in a letter published in FIFA News in August 1969 .
Koe Ewe Teik , the Malaysian FA 's member of the referee 's committee , led the move for its adoption by FIFA .
FIFA 's proposal was discussed on 20 February 1970 by a working party of the International Football Association Board ( IFAB ) , which recommended its acceptance , although " not entirely satisfied " with it .
It was adopted by the IFAB 's annual general meeting on 27 June 1970 .
In 2006 , Deutsche Presse - Agentur reported a claim by former referee Karl Wald ( b. 1916 ) , from Frankfurt am Main , that he had first proposed the shoot - out in 1970 to the Bavarian FA .
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Development .
In England , the first penalty shoot - out in a professional match took place in 1970 at Boothferry Park , Hull , between Hull City and Manchester United during the semi - final of the Watney Cup , and was won by Manchester United .
The first player to take a kick was George Best , and the first to miss was Denis Law .
Ian McKechnie , who saved Law 's kick , was also the first goalkeeper to take a kick ; his shot hit the crossbar and deflected over , putting Hull City out of the Cup .
Penalty shoot - outs were used to decide matches in UEFA 's European Cup and Cup Winners ' Cup in the 1970–71 season .
On 30 September 1970 , after a 4–4 aggregate draw in the first round of the Cup Winners ' Cup , Honvéd won the first shoot - out 5–4 against Aberdeen , when Jim Forrest 's shot hit the bar .
Five weeks later , on 4 November 1970 , the first ever European Cup shoot out took place between Everton F.C. and Borussia Mönchengladbach , with the side from England this time being the winners 4–3 .
In the first round of the European Cup 1972–73 , the referee prematurely ended a shoot - out between CSKA Sofia and Panathinaikos , with CSKA leading 3–2 but Panathinaikos having taken only four kicks .
Panathinaikos complained to UEFA and the match was annulled and replayed the following month , with CSKA winning without the need for a shoot - out .
The final of the 1973 Campeonato Paulista ended in similar circumstances .
Santos were leading Portuguesa 2–0 with each team having taken three shoot - out kicks , when referee Armando Marques mistakenly ( as each team still had two shots to take , and therefore Portuguesa still had a chance of leveling the scoreline ) declared Santos the winners .
Portuguesa manager Otto Glória quickly led his team out of the stadium ; this was allegedly to ensure the shoot - out could not resume once the mistake was discovered , and that instead the match would be replayed , giving Portuguesa a better chance of victory .
When Santos counter - objected to a replay , Paulista FA president Osvaldo Teixeira Duarte annulled the original match and declared both teams joint champions .
The first major international tournament to be decided by a penalty shoot - out was the 1976 European Championship final between Czechoslovakia and West Germany .
UEFA had made provision for a final replay two days later , but the teams decided to use a shoot - out instead .
Czechoslovakia won 5–3 , and the deciding kick was converted by Antonín Panenka with a " chip " after Uli Hoeneß had put the previous kick over the crossbar .
The first penalty shoot - out in the World Cup was on 9 January 1977 , in the first round of African qualifying , when Tunisia beat Morocco .
The first shoot - out in the finals tournament was in 1982 , when West Germany beat France in the semifinal .
If the 1982 final had been drawn , penalties would not have applied unless the replay was also drawn ; from 1986 , penalties were scheduled after the final as for the earlier knockout rounds .
FAMOUS INCIDENTS NATIONAL TEAM Section::::Famous incidents .
Section::::National team .
The finals of six major FIFA competitions , including two World Cups , have gone to penalty shoot - outs :
* The 1991 FIFA World Youth Championship final between Portugal and Brazil in Lisbon was decided on a penalty shoot - out which the Portuguese won 4–2 , with the last shot coming from Rui Costa .
*
In the 1994 FIFA World Cup Final at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena , California , Brazil and Italy ended extra time scoreless .
Brazil went on to win the shoot - out 3–2 .
* The 1999 FIFA Women 's World Cup Final between the United States and China , also at the Rose Bowl , was scoreless after extra time .
The United States team won the shoot - out 5–4 .
*
The 2006 FIFA World Cup Final also went to a penalty shoot - out ( after a 1–1 draw followed by a scoreless 30-mins .
extra time ) and was won by Italy 5–3 against France in Berlin 's Olympic Stadium .
*
The 2011 FIFA Women 's World Cup Final , held at Commerzbank Arena in Frankfurt , went to a penalty shoot - out ( after a 1–1 draw at full - time and a 2–2 draw after extra time ) between the USA and Japan .
Japan won the game after scoring 3 penalties to 1 penalty by the USA .
* The 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup final in Istanbul went to a penalty shoot - out after a 0–0 draw after extra time .
France won the game after scoring 4 penalties to 1 penalty by Uruguay .
Goalkeepers have been known to win shoot - outs by their kicking .
For example , in a UEFA Euro 2004 quarter - final match , Portugal goalkeeper Ricardo saved a kick ( without gloves ) from England 's Darius Vassell , and then scored the winning shot .
Another example is Vélez Sársfield 's José Luis Chilavert in the Copa Libertadores 1994 finals ( it should be noted that Chilavert had a reputation as a dead - ball specialist and scored 41 goals during his club career ) .
Antonín Panenka ( Czechoslovakia ) decided the penalty shoot - out at the final of the 1976 European Football Championship against West Germany with a famous chip to the middle of the goal .
England lost six ( out of eight ) penalty shoot - outs in major tournament finals , including losses to Germany in the semi - finals of the 1990 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 1996 ( the latter following a win over Spain by the same method in the previous round ) .
After Euro 1996 , England lost four more shoot - outs in a row in major tournament finals , losing to Argentina at the 1998 World Cup , Portugal at Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup and Italy at Euro 2012 , before finally breaking their losing streak at the 2018 World Cup against Colombia ; this shootout also allowed England to progress into the quarter - finals for the first time in twelve years .
The Netherlands , meanwhile , lost four consecutive shoot - outs ; against Denmark in Euro 1992 , France in Euro 1996 , Brazil in the 1998 World Cup , and Italy in Euro 2000 , before finally winning one against Sweden in Euro 2004 .
In Euro 2000 , the Netherlands had two penalty kicks during the match and four attempts in the shootout but only managed to convert one kick against Italian keeper Francesco Toldo .
Frank de Boer had both a penalty kick and shootout kick saved by Toldo , who also saved from Paul Bosvelt to give Italy a 3–1 shootout victory .
The Netherlands ' fortunes seemed to have improved during the 2014 World Cup when they defeated Costa Rica on penalty kicks in their quarter - final , only to lose again on penalties in their semi - final against Argentina .
The Italians have lost six shoot - outs in major championships , notably being eliminated from three consecutive World Cups ( 1990–1998 , including the 1994 final ) and the Euro 2016 quarter - finals on penalties .
However , they have also won three shoot - outs , including the Euro 2000 semi - final against the Netherlands , the Euro 2012 quarter - final against England , and the 2006 World Cup Final against France .
On 16 November 2005 , a place in the World Cup was directly determined by a penalty shoot - out for the first time .
The 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying playoff between Australia and Uruguay ended 1–1 on aggregate , with Uruguay winning the first leg 1–0 at home and Australia winning the second leg at home by the same score .
A scoreless 30 minutes of extra time was followed by a shoot - out , which Australia won 4–2 .
During the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany , Switzerland set an unwanted new record in the round of 16 shoot - out against Ukraine by failing to convert any of their penalties , losing 3–0 .
The goalkeeper Oleksandr Shovkovsky ( Ukraine ) became the first not to concede a single goal in the penalty shoot - out , saving two of the Swiss attempts , with another shot hitting the crossbar .
The result meant that Switzerland became the first nation to be eliminated from the World Cup without conceding any goals ( and , moreover , the only nation to participate in a World Cup finals tournament without conceding a goal ) .
The same competition featured a shoot - out between Germany and Argentina , the two most successful teams up to that point in terms of World Cup finals penalty shoot - outs : each team had competed in 3 shoot - outs and won all of them .
Germany won this shoot - out , leaving Germany alone with a 4–0 record in World Cup finals .
On 20 June 2007 , a new UEFA record was established .
The semi - final of the European under-21 Championships in Heerenveen between the Netherlands and England team finished 1–1 .
Thirty - two penalties had to be taken before the tie was broken .
The Netherlands eventually won 13–12 .
DOMESTIC CUPS Section::::Domestic cups .
In the FA Cup , penalty kicks were used in the 1972 edition of the short - lived third - place playoff .
They were introduced more generally in the 1991–92 season to decide matches still level after one replay and extra time .
Previously there was no limit on the number of replays , which led to fixture disruption , especially disliked by the top clubs .
Replays were often two or three days after the drawn match , which conflicted with the increased planning required after the Football Spectators Act 1989 .
The first team eliminated from the FA Cup on penalties was Scunthorpe United , beaten on 26 October 1991 by Rotherham United after a first - round replay .
A shoot - out was first used in the FA Cup Final in 2005 , when Arsenal beat Manchester United 5–4 .
The following year , Liverpool beat West Ham United in the FA Cup Final 's second ever penalty shoot - out .
On 31 August 2005 , a new English record was established when a shoot - out between Tunbridge Wells and Littlehampton Town in an FA Cup replay involved 40 kicks being taken , with Tunbridge Wells winning 16–15 .
Shoot - outs have been used to settle four Football League Cup finals to date .
The first was in 2001 when Liverpool beat Birmingham City 5–4 on penalties after a 1–1 draw after extra time in the match .
More recently the 2009 final between Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur ended goalless and was won 4–1 on penalties by Manchester United .
Then the 2012 final between Liverpool and Cardiff City finished 2–2 after extra time , Liverpool winning 3–2 on penalties .
The 2016 final was won by Manchester City beating Liverpool 3–1 on penalties , after a 1–1 draw .
Penalty shoot - outs have been used for many years to settle drawn games in the earlier rounds of the Football League Cup , the earliest example being August 1976
when Doncaster Rovers beat Lincoln City 3–2 on penalties after three drawn games in a row ( 1–1 , 1–1 , 2–2 ) in a first round match .
Shoot - outs tend to be quite rare in the semi - finals due to the away goal rule applying after extra time .
However , a shoot - out was used in the 2013–14 semi - final between Sunderland and Manchester United after both teams finished level over two legs ; Sunderland won the shoot - out 2–1 .
The Community Shield is also settled using penalties , following the normal 90 minutes of play , but no extra time .
Manchester United have won the shield three times via a shoot - out , beating Arsenal in 2003 , Chelsea in 2007 , and Portsmouth in 2008 .
Manchester United lost the 2009 match on penalties to Chelsea .
In 2008 , the Turkish Cup Final featured two clubs outside of Istanbul 's Top Three for the first time in two decades , but penalty kicks decided the winner between Gençlerbirliği and Kayserispor , the latter having reached the final for the first time ever .
After a scoreless 120 minutes , 28 penalty kicks were needed to decide the outcome , and Kayserispor , thanks to the goal scoring and goal saving heroics of Dimitar Ivankov , won its first Turkish Cup 11–10 .
In the 2008–09 Greek Cup final AEK took a 3–2 lead at 89 ' with a goal by Scocco ; however Olympiacos came back from the dead at the dying seconds of stoppage time ( 90'+6 ) with a goal by Derbyshire , to force an overtime .
While Olympiacos took a 4–3 lead in overtime with a goal by Galletti , the scorer was sent off with a second yellow card for taking his shirt off while celebrating .
Later on , Avraam Papadopoulos also got a second yellow leaving Olympiacos with 9 players .
AEK managed to tie the game at 4–4 forcing a penalty shoot out .
AEK was shooting first .
Both AEK and Olympiacos scored in the first 4 penalties .
Majstorovic of AEK hit the horizontal crossbar in the 5th penalty giving the chance to Djordjevic ( for whom it was the closing game of his career ) to seal the victory for Olympiacos .
However , his shot was blocked by AEK 's Argentinian goalkeeper Saha .
Hence , the shooting continued .
Both teams scored their 6th and 7th penalties .
Center - back Antzas was slotted to hit the 8th penalty for Olympiacos , but keeper Nikopolidis took the initiative and took the penalty instead tying the score to 7–7 .
Nikopolidis blocked the subsequent ( 9th ) penalty by Georgeas for AEK
but Antzas missed the penalty for Olympiacos ( saved by Saha ) and failed to finish the shoot - out .
Since Olympiacos had only 9 players in the field , the shooters had to rotate , going back to those that shoot the very first penalties .
All 7 subsequent penalty takers for both teams scored , leading to a penalty shoot out that was at 14–14 with 32 ( ! )
penalty shots having been taken .
However , Pelletieri of AEK had a bad penalty shot that was easily deflected by Nikopolidis , who then took the 34th penalty shot against the other goalkeeper , Saha , scoring , and ending this saga with a 15–14 win for Olympiacos in penalty shoot out and an overall score of 19–18 .
( 2008–09 Greek Cup ) .
UEFA CLUB COMPETITIONS Section::::UEFA club competitions .
The first penalty shoot - out in a European Cup final occurred in the 1984 European Cup Final as Liverpool defeated A.S. Roma .
The match is best known for the antics of Liverpool keeper Bruce Grobbelaar .
As Roma 's Bruno Conti prepared to take his kick , Grobbelaar walked towards the goal smiling confidently at the cameras lined - up behind , then proceeded to bite the back of the net , in imitation of eating spaghetti .
Conti sent his spot kick over the bar .
Grobbelaar then produced a similar performance before Francesco Graziani took his kick , famously wobbling his legs in mock terror .
Graziani duly missed and Liverpool went on to win the shootout 4–2 .
In the 1986 European Cup Final between FC Steaua Bucharest and FC Barcelona , Steaua keeper Helmuth Duckadam saved all four of Barca 's penalties , for which he was dubbed " the hero of Seville " .
Steaua also missed two , but still prevailed 2–0 in the shoot - out to become the only Romanian club side to win the title .
In the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final the penalty - shoot out has caused controversy among many fans as replays showed that Dida was off his goal line when saving penalties from Trezeguet , Zalayeta and Montero .
Buffon was also off his goal line when saving penalties from Seedorf and Kaladze .
In the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final between A.C. Milan and Liverpool F.C. , Liverpool keeper Jerzy Dudek used tactics similar to Bruce Grobbelaar in 1984 ( known as the " Dudek dance " in 2005 ) to distract the Milan shootout takers which resulted in a victory for his team .
The 2008 UEFA Champions League Final between Manchester United and Chelsea went to penalties , when John Terry missed a penalty which would have won Chelsea the match ( and the Champions League ) .
His standing leg slipped as he took his kick , and the ball hit the post .
Chelsea lost the shoot - out 6–5 , to which Terry reacted by breaking down in tears .
Terry was not originally the penalty taker , however , striker Didier Drogba had been sent off shortly before extra time ended .
In the semi - finals of the UEFA Champions League between Real Madrid and Bayern Munich , Iker Casillas and Manuel Neuer each saved two spot kicks .
Neuer kept out penalties from Cristiano Ronaldo ( £ 80 million ) and Kaká ( £ 65 million ) , then the most expensive footballers in history from their transfer fees .
On 19 May 2012 Chelsea defeated Bayern Munich 4–3 on penalties in the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final .
Chelsea had never previously won a shoot - out in the competition , and had lost the 2008 final and 2007 semi - final on penalties .
Bayern had never lost a shoot - out in Europe ; their wins included the 2001 final against Valencia and the 2012 semi - final against Real Madrid .
Didier Drogba dispatched the winning penalty , having been unable to take the fifth kick ( missed by Terry ) in the 2008 final due to a red card in extra time .
The following day , many British newspapers made reference to the fact that an English team had finally beaten a German team on penalties .
RECORDS Section::::Records .
On 17 July 2011 , during the 2011 Copa América tournament in Argentina , Brazil missed 4 penalties in a row in the quarter - final , which allowed Paraguay to reach the semi - finals 2–0 .
The current World Record for the most penalties scored consecutively in a shoot out stands at 29 , in a Hampshire Senior Cup second - round game between Brockenhurst and Andover Town on 9 October 2013 , in which the 30th penalty was saved allowing Brockenhurst to win 15–14 .
This beat the previous record of 27 , in a Johnstones Paint Trophy first round match between Leyton Orient F.C. and Dagenham & Redbridge F.C. on 7 September 2011 , in which the 28th penalty was saved allowing Dagenham to win the shootout .
During the final of the 1992 African Cup of Nations played in Senegal , Ivory Coast won the penalty shootout 11–10 .
After the second set of five penalty kicks still being tied at 10–10 , it went to sudden death , where the last penalty was missed by Anthony Baffoe , the stand in Ghanaian captain .
This is the most penalties in the final match of a major international tournament , and the last time a second set of 5 kicks was implemented in the rules .
The penalty shootout was significant in that it was the first in the final of a major international tournament that every player on the pitch took a penalty .
Fourteen years later , the Ivory Coast and Cameroon needed 24 penalties to decide who would advance to the semi - finals of the 2006 African Cup of Nations .
The Ivory Coast advanced by winning 12–11 after Samuel Eto'o missed his second attempt , as his was the only miss of the penalty shootout .
The current world record for the longest penalty shoot - out in a first class match is 48 penalties during the 2005 Namibian Cup when KK Palace beat Civics 17–16 .
However , the record for the highest score in a penalty shoot out was set in the 1988 Argentine Championship , when Argeninos Juniors beat Racing Club 20–19 after 44 penalties .
On 3 June 2015 Sundsøre IF beat Nykøbing Mors 20–19 in a penalty shoot out in a preliminary round of the Danish FA Cup .
On the 11 December 2012 , Bradford City set the record for most consecutive penalty shootout wins .
They won 9 penalty shootouts since 2009 and that included wins against Arsenal and local rivals Huddersfield Town .

A shoot - out is usually considered for statistical purposes to be separate from the match which preceded it .
In the case of a two - legged fixture , the two matches are still considered either as two draws or as one win and one loss ; in the case of a single match , it is still considered as a draw .
This contrasts with a fixture won in extra time , where the score at the end of normal time is superseded .
Converted shoot - out penalties are not considered as goals scored by a player for the purposes of their individual records , or for " golden boot " competitions .
The NCAA rules book , which governs most college soccer in the United States , takes a similar approach .
With the exception of the national championship game , if the score of any game remains tied following the sudden death overtime ( or golden goal ) , the game is recorded as a tie , regardless of the result of the shoot - out tiebreaker .
In a national championship game , the result of the shoot - out tiebreaker also determines the result of the game for statistical purposes .
Until 2001 , all NCAA games in which the shoot - out tiebreaker was used to determine advancement or a champion were recorded as a tie .
In 2002 , the rule was modified such that all games in which the shoot - out tiebreaker was used would also decide the winner of the game for statistical purposes .
The rule was again changed in 2003 to match the pre-2002 rule with the newly - added exception that a shoot - out tiebreaker in a national championship game would be decisive for all purposes , including the record .
In the calculation of UEFA coefficients , shoot - outs are ignored for club coefficients , but not national team coefficients , where the shoot - out winner gets 20,000 points : more than the shoot - out loser , who gets 10,000 ( the same as for a draw ) but less than the 30,000 points for winning a match outright .
In the FIFA World Rankings , the base value of a win is three points ; a win on penalties is two ; a draw and a loss on penalties are one ; a loss is zero .
The more complicated ranking system FIFA used from 1999 to 2006 gave a shoot - out winner the same points as for a normal win and a shoot - out loser the same points as for a draw ; goals in the match proper , but not the shoot - out , were factored into the calculation .
CRITICISMS Section::::Criticisms .
As a way to decide a football match , shoot - outs have been seen variously as a thrilling climax or as an unsatisfactory cop - out .
Paul Doyle describes shoot - outs as " exciting and suspense - filled " and the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final shoot - out as " the perfect way to end a wonderful ... final " .
Richard Williams compares the spectacle to " a public flogging in the market square " .
The result is often seen as a lottery rather than a test of skill ;
managers Luiz Felipe Scolari and Roberto Donadoni described them as such after their teams had respectively won and lost shoot - outs .
Others disagree .
Mitch Phillips called it " the ultimate test of nerve and technique " .
Paul Doyle emphasised the psychological element .
Only a small subset of a footballer 's skills is tested by a shoot - out .
Ian Thomsen likened deciding the 1994 World Cup using a penalty shoot - out to deciding the Masters golf tournament via a minigolf game .
The shoot - out is a test of individuals which may be considered inappropriate in a team sport ; Sepp Blatter has said " Football is a team sport and penalties is not a team , it is the individual " .
Inferior teams are tempted to play for a scoreless draw , calculating that a shoot - out offers their best hope of victory .
Red Star Belgrade 's performance beating Olympique Marseille in the 1991 European Cup Final is often condemned for having " played for penalties " from the kick - off ; a tactic coach Ljupko Petrović freely admitted to .
On the other hand , the increased opportunity for giant - killing may also be seen as an advantage , increasing the romance of a competition like the FA Cup .
Some teams have regarded , or been accused of regarding , a loss on penalties as an honourable result or " no defeat at all " .
The Economist reported on the advantage of the team kicking first usually wins and on the players aiming higher usually score a goal .
ADVANTAGE
TO TEAM KICKING FIRST ?
Section::::Advantage to team kicking first ?
Ignacio Palacios - Huerta has suggested that the alternating kick sequence gives an unfair advantage to the team kicking first , with statistical evidence showing that the team kicking first wins in 60 % of the cases , likely due to the team kicking second being under more pressure when trailing in the shoot - out .
As a remedy , he proposed using the Thue - Morse sequence to determine the kicking order .
As part of a trial to reduce this advantage , the IFAB sanctioned in March 2017 to test a different sequence of taking penalties , known as " ABBA " , that mirrors the serving sequence in a tennis tiebreak ( team A kicks first , team B kicks second ) : Original sequence Trial sequence
The trial was initially scheduled at the 2017 UEFA European Under-17 Championship and the 2017 UEFA Women 's Under-17 Championship in May 2017 if a penalty shoot - out would be needed .
The trial was extended in June 2017 to include the 2017 UEFA European Under-19 Championship and the 2017 UEFA Women 's Under-19 Championship .
The penalty shoot - out in the Women 's Under-17 Championship semi - final between Germany and Norway was the first ever to implement this new system .
It was also used in the 2017 FA Community Shield on 6 August 2017 .
During the IFAB 's 133rd Annual Business Meeting in Glasgow , Scotland on 22 November 2018 , it was agreed that due to the lack of strong support mainly because of its complexity , the ABBA option would no longer be used in future competitions .
ALTERNATIVES Section::::Alternatives .
Various tie - break methods have been proposed , both before and since shoot - outs were introduced .
Historically , one of the first tie - breaking procedures was contained in the between 1862 and 1871 , with the concept of the rouge , scorable when the ball went narrowly wide off the goal .
Rule 14 stated " A goal outweighs any number of rouges .
Should no goals or an equal number be obtained , the match is decided by rouges " .
Similarly , the try in rugby football was used from 1875 as a tie - breaker if teams were level on goals .
A drawn result may be allowed to stand , unless the fixture determines which team qualifies for a later round .
Before 1993 ( except in 1974 )
the FA Charity Shield was shared if the match was drawn .
When the third place playoff of the 1972 Olympic tournament between the USSR and East Germany ended 2–2 after extra time , the bronze medal was shared by the two teams .
During the qualification process for the 1962 World Cup , Morocco and Tunisia formed a two - team group .
They both won 2–1 at home , so they played a third match at a neutral location .
When this ended in a 1–1 draw after extra time , Morocco advanced on a coin toss to the next round of qualification .
This scenario was repeated in during the qualification process for the 1970 World Cup , when the same two teams were tied after three matches and extra time .
Again , Morocco advanced on a coin toss .
Tunisia did have better luck with the coin toss in the intervening years ; during the 1965 African Cup of Nations , they reached the final at the expense of Senegal by winning a coin toss after three group matches had left Tunisia and Senegal tied with a win ( over Ethiopia ) and a draw ( against each other ) .
Current alternatives include replaying a match that has ended in a draw .
This still occurs in the fifth ( last sixteen ) round and earlier rounds of the English FA Cup .
Until 1991 , any number of replays were permitted , with a record of five .
( Since then , a draw in the ( first ) replay has been resolved by a penalty - shoot - out . )
Only once , in 1974 , did the European Cup final go to a replay .
Other suggestions have included using elements of match play such as most shots on goal , most corner kicks awarded , fewest cautions and sendings - off , or having ongoing extra time with teams compelled to remove players at progressive intervals ( similar to regular season play in the National Hockey League , where players play 3-on-3 in the extra time ) .
These proposals have not yet been authorised by the International Football Association Board .
However , after the 2006 World Cup , Sepp Blatter stated that he wants no more penalty shoot - outs in the Final of the World Cup , tentatively suggesting either a replay or " Maybe to take players away and play golden goal " .
Henry Birtles ' " Advantage " proposal is for the shoot - out to be held before extra - time , and only acting as a tiebreak if the game remains a draw after the full 120 minutes .
Proponents of this idea state that it would lead to a more offensive extra - time as one of the teams would know they have to score and there would never be a match in which both teams are simply waiting for penalties .
Another advantage is that players who have missed would have a chance to redeem themselves in extra - time .
The obvious flaw is that the team that wins the penalty shoot - out would be inclined to play defensively in extra time in the knowledge that a draw would put them through .
However , this flaw is not so clear because a single goal makes the difference between winning and losing , as opposed to a team which defends a single - goal lead more comfortably because a conceded goal is the difference between winning and drawing .
Another alternative is Attacker Defender Goalkeeper ( ADG ) , which features a series of ten contests , in which an attacker has thirty seconds to score a goal against a defender and goalkeeper .
At the completion of the ten contests , the team with the most goals is the winner .
NORTH AMERICAN EXPERIMENTS Section::::North American experiments .
The North American Soccer League ( NASL ) in the 1970s and 1980s , then Major League Soccer ( MLS ) for its first four seasons ( 1996–1999 ) experimented with a variation of the shoot - out procedure .
Instead of a straight penalty kick , the shoot - out started from the goal and having five seconds to attempt a shot .
The player could make as many moves as he could in a breakaway situation in the five seconds , then attempt a shot .
This procedure is similar to that used in an ice hockey penalty shot .
As with a standard shoot - out , this variation used a best - of - five - kicks model , and if the score was still level , the tiebreaker would head to an extra round of one attempt per team .
This format rewarded player skills , as players were able to attempt to deceive goalkeepers and play the ball in an attempt to make the shot , as in a one - on - one skills contest , and goalkeepers could take on the attackers without restrictions that are normally implemented in penalty shootouts .
Soccer Bowl ' 81 , the NASL 's 1981 championship final , was decided by this format .
From its inception in 1968 , the NASL used an unconventional point system in determining the league standings .
Teams were awarded six points for a win and three points for a draw .
In addition , teams earned one bonus point for each goal scored in a game up to a maximum of three per game .
Thus , a team that lost 5–3 would earn three points .
However , a team that lost 1–0 would earn no points .
Also , a team that won 5–4 would earn nine points ( the same as a 3–0 win ) .
But a team that won 2–0 would earn only eight points .
In the league 's second season ( 1969 ) , the Kansas City Spurs were the league champions with 10 wins , 2 losses and 4 ties even though the Atlanta Chiefs had 11 wins , 2 losses and 3 ties , because Kansas City earned more bonus points .
Starting with 1971 postseason playoff matches , the NASL used a golden goal rule , and every match had a winner decided from the run of play .
Extra - time sessions were 15 minutes long before a brief break and change of ends .
Game 1 of the 1971 NASL semifinal series between the Rochester Lancers and the Dallas Tornado went six extra - time periods with Rochester scoring the game - winning goal in the 176th minute .
Game 3 of that same series went four extra time periods with Dallas scoring in the 148th minute to win the match and the series .
In 1975 , the NASL adopted a conventional penalty - kick shootout system for all regular - season and postseason playoff matches , and there were no longer any NASL matches that ended in ties .
In the standings , a team that won in regulation time was awarded six points .
A team that won in a penalty - kick shootout was awarded one point .
Bonus points continued to be awarded for each goal scored up to a maximum of three per game .
In 1977 , the NASL adopted the experimental North American shootout procedure described above .
If a match was tied after 90 minutes , a maximum of two golden goal extra time periods of 7.5 minutes each were played .
If neither team scored , the shootout was held to determine the winner of the match .
In the standings , a team that won was awarded six points whether the win came in regulation time , extra time or by shootout .
Bonus points continued to be awarded for each goal scored up to a maximum of three per game .
No bonus points were awarded for goals scored in extra time .
Postseason playoff games were decided in the same manner .
In 1981 , the number of points awarded to a team that won a game in a shootout was reduced from six to four .
This remained the system until the NASL 's final season in 1984 .
From its inception in 1996 , MLS used the shootout system that had been used by the NASL to determine winners of matches .
No regular - season or postseason playoff games ended in a tie .
In general , no extra time was played ; the shootout commenced immediately after 90 minutes had been played .
The only exception was in the MLS Cup Final in which a match tied after 90 minutes would be followed by a maximum of two 15-minute extra time sessions on a golden goal basis .
In the regular - season standings , a team that won a match in regulation was awarded three points .
A team that won a match in a shootout was awarded one point .
There were no bonus points or points awarded to teams that lost whether in regulation time or a shootout .
In the playoffs , the conference semifinals and conference finals were organized as best - of - three matches series .
A shootout win counted as a win .
Thus , a team could win two of the three matches by shootout and lose the other match in regulation and still advance to the next round .
This was inconsistent with how the teams were rewarded during the regular season when the team with one win would have earned three points , and the team with two wins would have earned only two points .
In 1999 , a maximum of two 15-minute golden goal extra time periods were added for matches that were tied after 90 minutes of regulation play .
If neither team scored during extra time , the match was decided by a shootout .
MLS abandoned the North American style shootout starting with the 2000 season .
If penalties are required to determine a winner during the playoffs , MLS now uses the shoot - out procedure specified by the International Football Association Board .
