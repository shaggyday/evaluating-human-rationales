THE 100 Section::::Plot .
Section::::The 100 .
The series is set three generations after a thermonuclear apocalypse , wherein the only known survivors of the human race live in a space colony consisting of satellites joined together in orbit around the Earth and governed by The Chancellor , who leads its legislative council .
Resources are so scarce that all crimes , no matter how small , are punishable by death , unless the perpetrator is under 18 years of age .
The 100 begins with Clarke Griffin , a former medical student , being arrested for a crime committed by her parents : conducting illegal experiments on children under threat of the corrupt Vice Chancellor Rhodes .
Clarke confides in her best friend Wells , The Chancellor 's son .
Despite swearing secrecy to Clarke , Wells tells his father , hoping to save the Griffins from Rhodes .
His plan backfires , the Griffins are arrested , and his relationship with Clarke disintegrates .
Two years later , the Colony decides to send 100 of its teenage prisoners to investigate whether or not Earth is habitable .
Among the 100 are Clarke , Wells , Octavia Blake , her older brother Bellamy Blake , and Clarke 's friend , Thalia .
The group crashes somewhere on the East Coast in the former United States .
Once there , the 100 struggle to survive in a world very different from the past Earth .
Clarke tends to the wounded , and Bellamy gradually develops a romantic interest in her .
It is revealed that Octavia had become a drug addict while in prison .
A few days later , someone sets fire to the camp , killing Thalia .
As the survivors investigate , they discover a farm not too far from the site , leading them to the realization that they are not alone .

Sasha leads Clarke and Bellamy to a colony beneath the ruins of Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center .
There , they meet her father , Max Walgrove , who is the leader of the colony .
Octavia is at Mount Weather , having been rescued by Max and his people from a group of renegades .
These renegades are responsible for the attacks on the 100 .
Max and his people promise that they will continue helping the 100 , and will provide further support once the rest of the Colony arrives .
At this point , they find dropships from the Colony falling from the sky .
Wells eventually realizes that there is something familiar about Bellamy and Octavia ; ultimately , he discovers that their mother was Melinda Blake , the woman his father had loved before marrying Wells ' mother for the sake of his career .
