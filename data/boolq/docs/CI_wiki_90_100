EXPO LINE ( LOS ANGELES METRO )
The Expo Line is a light - rail line that runs between Downtown Los Angeles and Santa Monica .
The line is named after Exposition Boulevard , which it runs alongside for most of its route .
It is one of the six lines in the Metro Rail system , and is operated by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority ( Metro ) .
The Expo Line largely follows the right - of - way of the former Pacific Electric Santa Monica Air Line .
Passenger service ended in 1953 ; freight - only service ended by March 1988 .
Several Expo Line stations are built in the same location as Air Line stations , although no original station structures have been reused .
SERVICE DESCRIPTION
CONSTRUCTION Section::::Service description .
Section::::Construction .
An independent agency , the Exposition Metro Line Construction Authority , was given the authority to plan , design , and construct the line by state law in 2003 .
After construction was completed , the line was handed over on January 15 , 2016 , to the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority for testing and operation .
The line was built in two phases ; the first phase comprised the section between Downtown Los Angeles and Culver City .
Construction began in early 2006 and most stations opened to the public on April 28 , 2012 .
The Culver City and Farmdale stations opened on June 20 , 2012 .
Design and construction on the portion between Culver City and Santa Monica started in September 2011 .
Testing along the phase 2 segment began on April 6 , 2015 , and the segment opened on May 20 , 2016 .
HOURS OF OPERATION Section::::Hours of operation .
The Expo Line operates from approximately 4:30 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. on weekdays and until 2:30 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays .

HISTORY Section::::History .
The Expo Line largely follows right of way used by the Los Angeles and Independence Railroad steam railroad , built in 1875 , which was converted by Pacific Electric to electric traction and operated as the Santa Monica Air Line by 1920 , providing both freight and passenger service between Los Angeles and Santa Monica .
Passenger service stopped in 1953 and diesel - powered freight deliveries ended in 1988 .
Local advocacy groups including Friends 4 Expo Transit supported the successful passage of Proposition C in 1990 , which allowed the purchase of the entire right - of - way from Southern Pacific by Metro .
Metro released a Major Investment Study in 2000 which compared bus rapid transit and light rail transit options along what was now known as the " Mid - City / Exposition Corridor " ; construction of the first phase to Culver City began in mid-2006 , and most stations opened to the public on April 28 , 2012 .
The Culver City and Farmdale stations opened on June 20 , 2012 .
Design and construction of the portion between Culver City and Santa Monica started in September 2011 .
Testing along the phase 2 segment began on April 6 , 2015 , and the segment opened on May 20 , 2016 .
PROPOSED
DEVELOPMENTS
REGIONAL CONNECTOR TRANSIT
PROJECT
Section::::Proposed developments .
Section::::Regional Connector Transit Project .
The Regional Connector is an under - construction light - rail subway corridor through Downtown Los Angeles that is to connect the current Blue and Expo Lines to the current Gold Line , and to allow a seamless one - seat ride between the Blue and Expo lines ' current 7th Street / Metro Center terminus and Union Station .
Once the Regional Connector is completed , the Blue , Expo , and Gold Lines will be simplified into two rail lines : a north - south line connecting Long Beach and Azusa ( colored blue ) , and an east - west line connecting Santa Monica and East Los Angeles ( colored gold ) .
Beginning in 2019 , Metro will commence using a renaming system where each rail and bus rapid transit line will receive a letter and color .
As a result , the Santa Monica - East L.A. line will be designated as E Line , retaining the " E " from the Expo Line and gold coloring .
The groundbreaking for the construction of the Regional Connector took place on September 30 , 2014 , and the alignment is expected to be in public service by late 2021 .
THE NEW BLUE CLOSURE Section::::The New Blue Closure .
By the summer of 2019 , the northern half of the Metro Blue Line will be closed .
The Expo Line will be affected for 3 weeks and will terminate at 23rd Street .

Section::::Maintenance facilities .
Previously , the light rail vehicles used on the Expo Line were maintained at the division 11 yard in Long Beach , California , the same maintenance facility that is used by the Blue Line .
However , the new division 14 yard , located east of Stewart Street and north of Exposition Boulevard in the vicinity of the 26th Street / Bergamot station in Santa Monica , was opened with the completion of Phase 2 .
ROLLING STOCK Section::::Rolling stock .
Compatible with the rest of Metro 's light - rail network , the Expo Line shares standard Metro light rail vehicles ( Nippon Sharyo P865 and P2020 , and Siemens P2000 ) with the Blue Line .
Metro estimates that it has 47 light rail cars to provide service on the Expo Line under the peak - hour assumption of 3-car trains running at 6-minute headways .
Upon completion of Phase 2 , it is expected that new P3010 light rail vehicles ( LRVs ) from Kinki Sharyo , that were ordered by the L.A. Metro board of directors in 2012 , will begin operation , replacing the current LRVs in operation on the Expo Line .
BIKEWAY
Section::::Bikeway .
The Expo Line Bikeway parallels the route of the light rail line , and includes a mixture of bike lanes on Exposition Boulevard and off - street paths alongside the rail tracks .
