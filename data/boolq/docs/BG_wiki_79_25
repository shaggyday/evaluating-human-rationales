CHIA PET Chia Pets are American styled terracotta figurines used to sprout chia , where the chia sprouts grow within a couple of weeks to resemble the animal 's fur or hair .
Moistened seeds of chia ( Salvia hispanica ) are applied to the grooved terra cotta figurine body .
Marketed by Joe Pedott and produced by San Francisco , California - based company Joseph Enterprises Inc. , the first Chia Pet , Chia Guy , was created on September 8 , 1977 .
A trademark registration was filed on Monday , October 17 , 1977 .
Pedott first learned about Chia Pets when he attended a housewares show in Chicago in 1977 .
Chia Pets achieved popularity in the 1980s following the 1982 release of a ram , the first widely marketed Chia Pet .
The catchphrase sung in the TV commercial as the plant grows in time
lapse is " Ch - ch - ch - chia ! " .
This catchphrase originated at an agency brainstorming meeting , where one of the individuals present pretended to stutter the product name .
As of 2007 , approximately 500,000 Chia Pets were sold annually , and they are sold only during the holiday season .
Originally made in Mexico , Chia Pets are now produced in China .
A range of generic animals has been produced , including a turtle , pig , puppy , kitten , frog , and hippopotamus .
Cartoon characters have also been licensed , including Garfield , Scooby - Doo , Looney Tunes , Shrek , The Simpsons , and SpongeBob .
Additionally , there are Chia Pets depicting real people , including Barack Obama and Bob Ross .
Joseph Enterprises sells replacement seeds for Chia products and also sells chia seeds in bulk as a nutritional supplement .
