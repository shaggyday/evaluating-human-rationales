PLOT Section::::Plot .
Will , an Iraq War veteran suffering from PTSD , lives with his 13-year - old daughter , Tom , in a public park inside Portland , Oregon .
They live in almost total isolation , only entering town for occasional food and supplies .
Will makes their money by selling his VA - issued painkillers to other veterans .
After Tom is accidentally spotted in the woods by a jogger , officers arrest them and place them into social services .
They are given food and a house on a Christmas tree farm in rural Oregon , on the condition that Will abides by the rules of the home owner and social services .
Will begrudgingly begins to work on the settlement packaging pine trees , while Tom interacts with local kids her age in a 4H club .
Will feels oppressed by others ' presence and tells Tom they are returning to the woods .
She follows reluctantly .
Will and Tom catch a ride north with a long - haul trucker , who lets them out , at Will 's direction , on the edge of trackless woods .
They bushwhack in a direction Will expects to lead to an unoccupied cabin , but cold and darkness force them to build a makeshift tent to survive the night .
The next day , they find an abandoned cabin and move in .
Will leaves to find food but does not return for some time .
Tom walks out to look for him , eventually finding him unconscious at the bottom of a hill , presumably from a slip and fall .
She gets help from some locals passing by , who take them back to their mobile home community .
One of them suggests taking Will to a hospital , but Tom , knowing that going to a hospital could mean going back into social services , refuses .
A local woman calls a friend of hers , a former Army medic ( and fellow PTSD sufferer ) , who gets Will on the road to recovery .
He also lends Will his own therapy dog to ease his mental adjustment to society .
Will and Tom stay in the community for some time while Will 's injuries heal .
Tom likes this new home , and hopes that she and her father can stay there permanently .
Will , however , continues to feel overwhelmed by social interaction and insists that they leave again .
Tom protests this , telling him " the same thing that 's wrong with you is n't wrong with me " .
When Will leaves anyway , Tom says that she can not go with him this time , and needs to try to live a normal life .
They tearfully hug and part ways .
