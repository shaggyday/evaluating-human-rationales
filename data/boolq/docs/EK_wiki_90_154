RANK - SIZE DISTRIBUTION Rank - size distribution is the distribution of size by rank , in decreasing order of size .
For example , if a data set consists of items of sizes 5 , 100 , 5 , and 8 , the rank - size distribution is 100 , 8 , 5 , 5 ( ranks 1 through 4 ) .
This is also known as the rank - frequency distribution , when the source data are from a frequency distribution .
These are particularly of interest when the data vary significantly in scale , such as city size or word frequency .
These distributions frequently follow a power law distribution , or less well - known ones such as a stretched exponential function or parabolic fractal distribution , at least approximately for certain ranges of ranks ; see below .
A rank - size distribution is not a probability distribution or cumulative distribution function .
Rather , it is a discrete form of a quantile function ( inverse cumulative distribution ) in reverse order , giving the size of the element at a given rank .
SIMPLE
RANK - SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS Section::::Simple rank - size distributions .
In the case of city populations , the resulting distribution in a country , a region , or the world will be characterized by its largest city , with other cities decreasing in size respective to it , initially at a rapid rate and then more slowly .
This results in a few large cities and a much larger number of cities orders of magnitude smaller .
For example , a rank 3 city would have one - third the population of a country 's largest city , a rank 4 city would have one - fourth the population of the largest city , and so on .
When any log - linear factor is ranked , the ranks follow the Lucas numbers , which consist of the sequentially additive numbers 1 , 3 , 4 , 7 , 11 , 18 , 29 , 47 , 76 , 123 , 199 , etc .
Like the more famous Fibonacci sequence , each number is approximately 1.618 ( the Golden ratio ) times the preceding number .
For example , the third term in the sequence above , 4 , is approximately 1.618 , or 4.236 ; the fourth term , 7 , is approximately 1.618 , or 6.854 ; the eighth term , 47 , is approximately 1.618 , or 46.979 .
With higher values , the figures converge .
An equiangular spiral is sometimes used to visualize such sequences .
SEGMENTATION Section::::Segmentation .
A rank - size ( or rank - frequency ) distribution is often segmented into ranges .
This is frequently done somewhat arbitrarily or due to external factors , particularly for market segmentation , but can also be due to distinct behavior as rank varies .
Most simply and commonly , a distribution may be split in two , termed the head and tail .
If a distribution is broken into three pieces , the third ( middle ) piece has several terms , generically middle , also belly , torso , and body .
These frequently have some adjectives added , most significantly long tail , also fat belly , chunky middle , etc .
In more traditional terms , these may be called top - tier , mid - tier , and bottom - tier .
The relative sizes and weights of these segments ( how many ranks in each segment , and what proportion of the total population is in a given segment )
qualitatively characterizes a distribution , analogously to the skewness or kurtosis of a probability distribution .
Namely : is it dominated by a few top members ( head - heavy , like profits in the recorded music industry ) , or is it dominated by many small members ( tail - heavy , like internet search queries ) , or distributed in some other way ?
Practically , this determines strategy : where should attention be focused ?
These distinctions may be made for various reasons .
For example , they may arise from differing properties of the population , as in the 90–9–1 principle , which posits that in an internet community , 90 % of the participants of a community only view content , 9 % of the participants edit content , and 1 % of the participants actively create new content .
As another example , in marketing one may pragmatically consider the head as all members that receive personalized attention , such as personal phone calls ; while the tail is everything else , which does not receive personalized attention , for example receiving form letters ; and the line is simply as far as resources allow , or where it makes business sense to stop .
Purely quantitatively , a conventional way of splitting a distribution into head and tail is to consider the head to be the first p portion of ranks , which account for formula_1 of the overall population , as in the 80:20 Pareto principle , where the top 20 % ( head ) comprises 80 % of the overall population .
The exact cutoff depends on the distribution – each distribution has a single such cutoff point — and for power laws can be computed from the Pareto index .
Segments may arise naturally due to actual changes in behavior of the distribution as rank varies .
Most common is the king effect , where behavior of the top handful of items does not fit the pattern of the rest , as illustrated at top for country populations , and above for most common words in English Wikipedia .
For higher ranks , behavior may change at some point , and be well - modeled by different relations in different regions ; on the whole by a piecewise function .
For example , if two different power laws fit better in different regions , one can use a broken power law for the overall relation ; the word frequency in English Wikipedia ( above ) also demonstrates this .
The Yule – Simon distribution that results from preferential attachment ( intuitively , " the rich get richer " and " success breeds success " ) simulates a broken power law and has been shown to " very well capture " word frequency versus rank distributions .
It originated from trying to explain the population verses rank in different species .
It has also been show to fit city population versus rank better .
RANK - SIZE RULE Section::::Rank - size rule .
The rank - size rule ( or law ) , describes the remarkable regularity in many phenomena , including the distribution of city sizes , the sizes of businesses , the sizes of particles ( such as sand ) , the lengths of rivers , the frequencies of word usage , and wealth among individuals .
All are real - world observations that follow power laws , such as Zipf 's law , the Yule distribution , or the Pareto distribution .
If one ranks the population size of cities in a given country or in the entire world and calculates the natural logarithm of the rank and of the city population , the resulting graph will show a log - linear pattern .
This is the rank - size distribution .
THEORETICAL RATIONALE Section::::Theoretical rationale .
One study claims that the rank size rule " works " because it is a " shadow " or coincidental measure of the true phenomenon .
The true value of rank size is thus not as an accurate mathematical measure ( since other power - law formulas are more accurate , especially at ranks lower than 10 ) but rather as a handy measure or " rule of thumb " to spot power laws .
When presented with a ranking of data , is the third - ranked variable approximately one - third the value of the highest - ranked one ?
Or , conversely , is the highest - ranked variable approximately ten times the value of the tenth - ranked one ?
If so , the rank size rule has possibly helped spot another power law relationship .
KNOWN EXCEPTIONS TO SIMPLE RANK - SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS Section::::Known exceptions to simple rank - size distributions .
While Zipf 's law works well in many cases , it tends to not fit the largest cities in many countries ; one type of deviation is known as the King effect .
A 2002 study found that Zipf 's law was rejected for 53 of 73 countries , far more than would be expected based on random chance .
The study also found that variations of the Pareto exponent are better explained by political variables than by economic geography variables like proxies for economies of scale or transportation costs .
A 2004 study showed that Zipf 's law did not work well for the five largest cities in six countries .
In the richer countries , the distribution was flatter than predicted .
For instance , in the United States , although its largest city , New York City , has more than twice the population of second - place Los Angeles , the two cities ' metropolitan areas ( also the two largest in the country ) are much closer in population .
In metropolitan - area population , New York City is only 1.3 times larger than Los Angeles .
In other countries , the largest city would dominate much more than expected .
For instance , in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , the capital , Kinshasa , is more than eight times larger than the second - largest city , Lubumbashi .
When considering the entire distribution of cities , including the smallest ones , the rank - size rule does not hold .
Instead , the distribution is log - normal .
This follows from Gibrat 's law of proportionate growth .
Because exceptions are so easy to find , the function of the rule for analyzing cities today is to compare the city - systems in different countries .
The rank - size rule is a common standard by which urban primacy is established .
A distribution such as that in the United States or China does not exhibit a pattern of primacy , but countries with a dominant " primate city " clearly vary from the rank - size rule in the opposite manner .
Therefore , the rule helps to classify national ( or regional ) city - systems according to the degree of dominance exhibited by the largest city .
Countries with a primate city , for example , have typically had a colonial history that accounts for that city pattern .
If a normal city distribution pattern is expected to follow the rank - size rule ( i.e. if the rank - size principle correlates with central place theory ) , then it suggests that those countries or regions with distributions that do not follow the rule have experienced some conditions that have altered the normal distribution pattern .
For example — the presence of multiple regions within large nations such as China and the United States tends to favor a pattern in which more large cities appear than would be predicted by the rule .
By contrast , small countries that had been connected ( e.g. colonially / economically ) to much larger areas will exhibit a distribution in which the largest city is much larger than would fit the rule , compared with the other cities — the excessive size of the city theoretically stems from its connection with a larger system rather than the natural hierarchy that central place theory would predict within that one country or region alone .
