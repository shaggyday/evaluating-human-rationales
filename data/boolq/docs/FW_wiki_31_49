THE BRIDGE ( SIRIUS XM )
The Bridge is on Sirius XM Radio channel 32 and Dish Network 6032 .
It is devoted to gold - based soft rock and adult contemporary music .
The channel is programmed by Mary Sue Twohy .
The channel plays mainly 1970s acts , such as Fleetwood Mac , James Taylor , Carole King , Jackson Browne , Elton John , Jim Croce , The Eagles , America , and Billy Joel , along with some later 1980s and 1990s artists like Sting , Bonnie Raitt , and others .
It was basically the 1960s and 1970s counterpart of the former StarLite channel for the Sirius service before the Sirius / XM merger replaced StarLite with The Blend ( which covers adult contemporary music from the 1970s - now ) .
The Bridge , originally on Sirius channel 10 , has often been removed from the lineup when the service wants to devote a channel to a single artist for a period of time , such as The Rolling Stones or The Who .
On September 27 , 2007 , it was displaced by E Street Radio , devoted to the music of Bruce Springsteen .
The channel could still be heard on Sirius ' internet stream , however .
These frequent and long - lasting periods of preemption have angered many subscribers .
The Bridge returned to the Sirius satellites on June 24 , 2008 on channel 12 , forcing Super Shuffle to take the SIR-2 stream formerly used by The Bridge .
On November 1 , 2008 , channel 12 switched to Led Zeppelin Radio , with The Bridge moved to channel 33 .
On November 12 , 2008 , channel 12 became The Pulse as part of the Sirius / XM merger , moving Led Zeppelin Radio to channel 33 and forcing The Bridge to go on hiatus for the rest of the year .
The Bridge returned to Sirius ( and debuted on XM ) on January 1 , 2009 .
The Bridge is available on Dish Network channel 6032 .
Until February 9 , 2010 , it was heard on DirecTV channel 849 , but all of the Sirius XM programming was dropped in favor of Sonic Tap by DMX .
From February 14-March 13 , 2009 , the channel was temporarily pre - empted for Fireman Radio , a channel devoted to the music of Paul McCartney .
From October 15-October 22 , 2010 , it was again pre - empted for Elton ! , a channel devoted to the music of Elton John .
From November 29-December 26 , 2010 , The Bridge was again pre - empted for Band on the Run Radio , another Paul McCartney oriented format .
