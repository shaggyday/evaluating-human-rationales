Saks Fifth Avenue is the successor of a business founded by Andrew Saks in 1867 and incorporated in New York in 1902 as Saks & Company .
Saks died in 1912 , and in 1923 Saks & Co. merged with Gimbel Brothers , Inc. , which was owned by a cousin of Horace Saks , Bernard Gimbel , operating as a separate autonomous subsidiary .
On September 15 , 1924 , Horace Saks and Bernard Gimbel opened Saks Fifth Avenue in New York City , with a full - block avenue frontage south of St. Patrick 's Cathedral , facing what would become Rockefeller Center .
The architects were Starrett & van Vleck , who developed a reticent , genteel Anglophile classicizing facade similar to their Gimbels Department Store in Pittsburgh ( 1914 ) .
When Bernard 's brother , Adam Gimbel , became president of Saks Fifth Avenue in 1926 after Horace Saks 's sudden passing , the company expanded , opening seasonal resort branches in Palm Beach , Florida and Southampton , New York , in 1928 .
The first full - line year - round Saks store opened in Chicago , in 1929 , followed by another resort store in Miami Beach , Florida .

By the end of the 1930s , Saks Fifth Avenue had a total of 10 stores , including resort locations such as Sun Valley , Idaho , Mount Stowe , and Newport , Rhode Island .
More full - line stores followed with Detroit , Michigan , in 1940 and Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , in 1949 .
In Downtown Pittsburgh , the company moved to its own freestanding location approximately one block from its former home on the fourth floor in the downtown Gimbel 's flagship .
The San Francisco location opened in 1952 , competing locally with I. Magnin .

keep money it owed to clothing makers " , inflating Saks ' yearly earnings up to 43 % and abusively collecting around $ 30 million from suppliers over seven years .
Saks settled with the SEC in 2007 , after firing three or more executives involved in the fraudulent activities .
In 2014 , Saks fired transgender employee Leyth Jamal after she was allegedly " belittled by coworkers , forced to use the men 's room and repeatedly referred to by male pronouns ( he and him ) " .
After Jamal submitted a lawsuit for unfair dismissal , the company stated in a motion to dismiss that " it is well settled that transsexuals are not protected by Title VII . "
In a court filing , the United States Department of Justice rebuked Saks ' argument , stating that " discrimination against an individual based on gender identity is discrimination because of sex .
" The company was removed from the Human Rights Campaign 's list of " allies " during the controversy .
The lawsuit was later settled amicably , without disclosing the terms of the settlement .
In 2017 , following the events of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico , Saks 's San Juan store located in Mall of San Juan suffered major damages along with its neighboring anchor store Nordstrom .
