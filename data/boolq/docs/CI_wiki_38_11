The Animated Series , and the DC Animated Universe " , and in an interview with ComicBook.com
that it was always his intent for the film to be in continuity but went on to state that he 's " not actually in control of what 's in continuity and

With the conclusion of the Justice League Unlimited animated series , Warner Bros has moved on to adapting new versions of the various DC comics properties rather than reviving the DCAU counterparts .
The last script written for DCAU continuity was titled Justice League : Worlds Collide .
This screenplay was created to bridge the several month gap between Justice League and Justice League Unlimited .
The draft was eventually adapted into the February 2010 film , with the removal of any references specific to DCAU continuity , replacing Green Lantern John Stewart with Hal Jordan , and the casting of different voice actors than those of the DCAU .
In 2009 , Bruce Timm was asked at a ToonZone forum if the DCAU will return in the future , and he stated this : On June 8 , 2015 , during an interview with Nerdist about his new film , Bruce Timm was asked if the DC animated universe will return someday .
Although Timm stated that the DCAU continuity was unlikely to return , the possibility always exists .
In 2017 , Bruce Timm confirmed that he considers the DC Universe Animated Original Movie Batman and Harley Quinn to be part of the DCAU canon .
Warner Brothers has billed the movie stating " Bruce Timm returns to his Batman : The Animated Series roots .
"
DC has listed the film as a Batman : the Animated Series movie on their website and on the back of the trade collection of the movies tie - in comics stated " Head back to the universe of Batman : The Animated Series in Batman and Harley Quinn "
