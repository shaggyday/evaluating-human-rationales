MAMMAL Mammals ( from Latin mamma " breast " ) are vertebrate animals constituting the class Mammalia , and characterized by the presence of mammary glands , which in females produce milk for feeding ( nursing ) their young ; a neocortex ( a region of the brain ) ; hair ; and three middle ear bones .
These characteristics distinguish them from reptiles and birds , from which they diverged in the late Triassic .
There are around 5,450 species of mammals .
The largest orders are the rodents , bats and Soricomorpha ( shrews and allies ) .
The next three are the Primates ( apes , monkeys , and allies ) , the Cetartiodactyla ( whales and even - toed ungulates ) , and the Carnivora ( cats , dogs , seals , and others ) .
In cladistics , which reflect evolution , mammals are classified as endothermic amniotes .
They are the only living Synapsida , which together with the Sauropsida ( reptiles and birds ) form the Amniota clade .
The early synapsid mammalian ancestors were sphenacodont pelycosaurs , a group that produced the non - mammalian Dimetrodon .
At the end of the Carboniferous period , this group diverged from the sauropsid line that led to today 's reptiles and birds .
The line following the stem group Sphenacodontia split - off several diverse groups of non - mammalian synapsids — sometimes referred to as mammal - like reptiles — before giving rise to the proto - mammals ( Therapsida ) in the early Mesozoic era .
The modern mammalian orders arose in the Paleogene and Neogene periods of the Cenozoic era , after the extinction of non - avian dinosaurs , and have been among the dominant terrestrial animal groups from 66 million years ago to the present .
The basic body type is quadriped , and most mammals use their four extremities for terrestrial locomotion ; but in some , the extremities are adapted for life at sea , in the air , in trees , underground , or on two legs .
Mammals range in size from the bumblebee bat to the blue whale - the largest animal on the planet .
All modern mammals give birth to live young , except the five species of monotremes , which are egg - laying mammals .
The most species - rich group of mammals , the cohort called placentals , have a placenta , which enables the feeding of the fetus during gestation .
Most mammals are intelligent , with some possessing large brains , self - awareness , and tool use .
Mammals can communicate and vocalize in several different ways , including the production of ultrasound , scent - marking , alarm signals , singing , and echolocation .
Mammals can organize themselves into fission - fusion societies , harems , and hierarchies , but can also be solitary and territorial .
Most mammals are polygynous , but some can be monogamous or polyandrous .
In human culture , domesticated mammals played a major role in the Neolithic revolution , causing farming to replace hunting and gathering , and leading to a major restructuring of human societies with the first civilizations .
They provided , and continue to provide , power for transport and agriculture , as well as various commodities such as food ( meat and dairy products ) , [ [ fur ] , and [ [ leather ] ] .
Mammals are [ [ huntinghunted ] ] or raced for sport , and are used as [ [ model organism]]s in science .
Mammals have been depicted in [ [ art ] ]
since [ [ Palaeolithic ] ]
times , and appear in literature , film , mythology , and religion .
[ [ Defaunation ] ] of mammals is primarily driven by [ [ Holocene extinctionanthropogenic ] ] factors , such as [ [ poaching ] ] and [ [ habitat destruction ] ] , though there are efforts to combat this .
CLASSIFICATION Section::::Classification .
[ [ File : Mammal species pie
chart.svgthumbupright=1.35The orders [ [ Rodent]]ia ( blue ) , [ [ Chiroptera ] ] ( red ) and [ [ Soricomorpha ] ]
( yellow ) together make up over 70 % of mammal species .
Mammal classification has been through several iterations since [ [ Carl Linnaeus ] ]
initially defined the class .
No classification system is universally accepted ; McKenna & Bell ( 1997 ) and Wilson & Reader ( 2005 ) provide useful recent compendiums .
[ [ George Gaylord Simpson ] ] 's " Principles of Classification and a Classification of Mammals " ( AMNH Bulletin v. 85 , 1945 ) provides [ [ systematics ] ] of mammal origins and relationships that were universally taught until the end of the 20th century .
Since Simpson 's classification , the [ [ fossil recordpaleontological record ] ] has been recalibrated , and the intervening years have seen much debate and progress concerning the theoretical underpinnings of systematization itself , partly through the new concept of [ [ cladistics ] ] .
Though field work gradually made Simpson 's classification outdated , it remains the closest thing to an official classification of mammals .
Most mammals , including the six most species - rich [ [ order ( biology)orders ] ] , belong to the placental group .
The three largest orders in numbers of species are [ [ Rodent]]ia : [ [ Mousemice ] ] , [ [ rat]]s , [ [ porcupine]]s , [ [ beaver]]s , [ [ capybara]]s and other gnawing mammals ; [ [ Chiroptera ] ] : bats ; and [ [ Soricomorpha ] ] : [ [ shrew]]s , [ [ Mole ( animal)moles ] ] and [ [ solenodon]]s .
The next three biggest orders , depending on the [ [ biological classification ] ]
scheme used , are the [ [ Primate]]s including the [ [ ape]]s , [ [ monkey]]s and [ [ lemur]]s ; the [ [ Cetartiodactyla ] ] including [ [ whale]]s and [ [ even - toed ungulates ] ] ; and the [ [ Carnivora ] ] which includes [ [ cat]]s , [ [ dog]]s , [ [ weasel]]s , [ [ bear]]s , [ [ Pinnipedseals ] ] and allies .
According to [ [ Mammal Species of the World ] ] , 5,416 species were identified in 2006 .
These were grouped into 1,229 [ [ genusgenera ] ] , 153 [ [ family ( biology)families ] ] and 29 orders .
In 2008 , the [ [ International Union for Conservation of Nature ] ] ( IUCN ) completed a five - year Global Mammal Assessment for its [ [ IUCN Red List ] ] , which counted 5,488 species .
According to a research published in the [ [ Journal of Mammalogy ] ]
in 2018 , the number of recognized mammal species is 6,495 species included 96 recently extinct .
DEFINITIONS Section::::Definitions .
The word " [ [ : wikt : mammalmammal ] ] " is modern , from the scientific name Mammalia coined by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 , derived from the [ [ Latin languageLatin ] ]
[ [ wikt : mamma#Latinmamma ] ]
( " teat , pap " ) .
In an influential 1988 paper , Timothy Rowe defined Mammalia [ [ Phylogeneticsphylogenetically ] ] as the [ [ crown group ] ] of mammals , the [ [ clade ] ]
consisting of the [ [ most recent common ancestor ] ] of living [
[ monotreme]]s
( [ [ echidna]]s and [ [ platypus]]es ) and [ [ theria]]n mammals ( [ [ marsupial]]s and [ [ placental]]s ) and all descendants of that ancestor .
Since this ancestor lived in the [ [ Jurassic ] ]
period , Rowe 's definition excludes all animals from the earlier [ [ Triassic ] ] , despite the fact that Triassic fossils in the [ [ Haramiyida ] ] have been referred to the Mammalia since the mid-19th century .
If Mammalia is considered as the crown group , its origin can be roughly dated as the first known appearance of animals more closely related to some extant mammals than to others .
[ [ Ambondro mahaboAmbondro ] ]
is more closely related to monotremes than to therian mammals while [ [ Amphilestes ] ] and [ [ Amphitherium ] ]
are more closely related to the therians ; as fossils of all three genera are dated about in the [ [ Middle Jurassic ] ]
, this is a reasonable estimate for the appearance of the crown group .
T. S. Kemp has provided a more traditional definition : " [ [ synapsid]]s that possess a [ [ dentary]]–[[squamosal bonesquamosal ] ]
jaw articulation and [ [ Occlusion ( dentistry)occlusion ] ] between upper and lower molars with a transverse component to the movement " or , equivalently in Kemp 's view , the clade originating with the last common ancestor of [ [ Sinoconodon ] ] and living mammals .
The earliest known synapsid satisfying Kemp 's definitions is [ [ Tikitherium ] ] ,
dated , so the appearance of mammals in this broader sense can be given
this [ [ Late Triassic ] ] date .
MCKENNA / BELL CLASSIFICATION
Section::::McKenna / Bell classification .
In 1997 , the mammals were comprehensively revised by [ [ Malcolm McKennaMalcolm C. McKenna ] ] and Susan K. Bell , which has resulted in the McKenna / Bell classification .
Their 1997 book , Classification of Mammals above the Species Level , is a comprehensive work on the systematics , relationships and occurrences of all mammal taxa , living and extinct , down through the rank of genus , though molecular genetic data challenge several of the higher level groupings .
The authors worked together as [ [ paleontologist]]s at the [ [ American Museum of Natural History ] ] , [ [ New York CityNew York ] ] .
McKenna inherited the project from Simpson and , with Bell , constructed a completely updated hierarchical system , covering living and extinct taxa that reflects the historical genealogy of Mammalia .
[ [ Extinct ] ]
groups are represented by a [ [ Dagger ( typography)dagger ] ] ( † ) .

[ [ elephant]]s , [
[ manatee]]s and [ [ hyrax]]es MOLECULAR CLASSIFICATION OF PLACENTALS Section::::Molecular classification of placentals .
Molecular studies based on [ [ DNA ] ]
analysis have suggested new relationships among mammal families over the last few years .
Most of these findings have been independently validated by [ [ retrotransposon ] ]
[ [ retrotransposon markerpresence / absence data ] ] .
Classification systems based on molecular studies reveal three major groups or lineages of placental mammals—[[Afrotheria ] ] , [ [ Xenarthra ] ] and [ [ Boreoeutheria]]—which [ [ Speciationdiverged ] ]
in the [ [ Cretaceous ] ] .
The relationships between these three lineages is contentious , and all three possible different hypotheses have been proposed with respect to which group is [ [ Basal ( phylogenetics)basal ] ] .
These hypotheses are [ [ Atlantogenata ] ] ( basal Boreoeutheria ) , [ [ Epitheria ] ] ( basal Xenarthra ) and [ [ Exafroplacentalia ] ] ( basal Afrotheria ) .
Boreoeutheria in turn contains two major lineages—[[Euarchontoglires ] ]
and [ [ Laurasiatheria ] ] .
Estimates for the divergence times between these three placental groups range from 105 to 120 million years ago , depending on the type of DNA used ( such as [ [ nuclear DNAnuclear ] ]
or [ [ mitochondrial DNAmitochondrial ] ] ) and varying interpretations of [ [ paleogeographic ] ] data .

Section::::Origins . [ [ Synapsida ] ] , a clade that contains mammals and their extinct relatives , originated during the [ [ Pennsylvanian ( geology)Pennsylvanian subperiod ] ]
( ~323 million to ~300 million years ago ) , when they split from reptilian and avian lineages .
Crown group mammals evolved from earlier [ [ Mammaliaformesmammaliaforms ] ]
during the [ [ Early Jurassic ] ] .
The cladogram takes Mammalia to be the crown group .
EVOLUTION FROM AMNIOTES Section::::Evolution from amniotes .
[ [ File : Skull synapsida 1.pngthumbThe original synapsid skull structure contains one [ [ temporal fenestraetemporal opening ] ]
behind the [ [ eye socketorbitals ] ] , in a fairly low position on the skull ( lower right in this image ) .
This opening might have assisted in containing the jaw muscles of these organisms which could have increased their biting strength . ] ]
The first fully terrestrial [
[ vertebrate]]s were [ [ amniote]]s .
Like their amphibious [ [ tetrapod ] ]
predecessors , they had lungs and limbs .
Amniotic eggs , however , have internal membranes that allow the developing [ [ embryo ] ]
to breathe but keep water in .
Hence , amniotes can lay eggs on dry land , while amphibians generally need to lay their eggs in water .
The first amniotes apparently arose in the Pennsylvanian subperiod of the [ [ Carboniferous ] ] .
They descended from earlier [ [ Reptiliomorphareptiliomorph ] ]
amphibious tetrapods , which lived on land that was already inhabited by [ [ insect]]s and other invertebrates as well as [ [ fern]]s , [ [ moss]]es and other plants .
Within a few million years , two important amniote lineages became distinct : the [ [ synapsid]]s , which would later include the common ancestor of the mammals ; and the [ [ sauropsid]]s , which now include [ [ turtle]]s , [ [ lizard]]s , [ [ snake]]s , [ [ crocodilian]]s , [ [ dinosaur]]s and [ [ bird]]s .
Synapsids have a single hole ( [ [ temporal fenestra ] ] )
low on each side of the skull .
One synapsid group , the [ [ pelycosaur]]s , included the largest and fiercest animals of the early [ [ Permian ] ] .
Nonmammalian synapsids are sometimes called " mammal - like reptiles " .
[ [ Therapsid]]s , a group of synapsids , descended from [ [ pelycosaur]]s in the Middle Permian , about 265 million years ago , and became the dominant land vertebrates .
They differ from basal [ [ Eupelycosauriaeupelycosaurs ] ]
in several features of the skull and jaws , including : larger skulls and [ [ incisor]]s which are equal in size in therapsids , but not for eupelycosaurs .
The therapsid lineage leading to mammals went through a series of stages , beginning with animals that were very similar to their pelycosaur ancestors and ending with [ [
probainognathia]]n [ [ cynodont]]s , some of which could easily be mistaken for mammals .
Those stages were characterized by : * The gradual development of a bony secondary [ [ hard palatepalate ] ] .
* Progression towards an erect limb posture , which would increase the animals ' stamina by avoiding [ [ Carrier 's constraint ] ] .
But this process was slow and erratic : for example , all herbivorous nonmammaliaform therapsids retained sprawling limbs ( some late forms may have had semierect hind limbs ) ; Permian carnivorous therapsids had sprawling forelimbs , and some late Permian ones also had semisprawling hindlimbs .
In fact , modern monotremes still have semisprawling limbs .
*
The [ [ Mandible#In other vertebratesdentary ] ]
gradually became the main bone of the lower jaw which , by the Triassic , progressed towards the fully mammalian jaw ( the lower consisting only of the dentary ) and middle ear ( which is constructed by the bones that were previously used to construct the jaws of reptiles ) .
FIRST MAMMALS Section::::First mammals .
The [ [ Permian – Triassic extinction event ] ]
about 252 million years ago , which was a prolonged event due to the accumulation of several extinction pulses , ended the dominance of carnivorous therapsids .
In the early Triassic , most medium to large land carnivore niches were taken over by [ [ archosaur]]s which , over an extended period ( 35 million years ) , came to include the [ [ Crocodylomorphacrocodylomorphs ] ] , the [ [ pterosaur]]s and the dinosaurs ; however , large cynodonts like [ [ Trucidocynodon ] ] and [ [ Traversodontidaetraversodontids ] ]
still occupied large sized carnivorous and herbivorous niches respectively .
By the Jurassic , the dinosaurs had come to dominate the large terrestrial herbivore niches as well .
The first mammals ( in Kemp 's sense ) appeared in the Late Triassic epoch ( about 225 million years ago ) , 40 million years after the first therapsids .
They expanded out of their nocturnal [ [ insectivore ] ]
niche from the mid - Jurassic onwards ; The Jurassic [ [ Castorocauda ] ] , for example , was a close relative of true mammals that had adaptations for swimming , digging and catching fish .
Most , if not all , are thought to have remained nocturnal ( the [ [ Nocturnal bottleneck ] ] ) , accounting for much of the typical mammalian traits .
The majority of the mammal species that existed in the [ [ MesozoicMesozoic Era ] ] were multituberculates , eutriconodonts and [ [ spalacotheriid]]s .
The earliest known [ [ metatherian ] ] is [ [ Sinodelphys ] ] , found in 125 million - year - old [ [ Early Cretaceous ] ]
[ [ shale ] ]
in China 's northeastern [ [ Liaoning Province ] ] .
The fossil is nearly complete and includes tufts of fur and imprints of soft tissues .
[ [ File : Juramaia NT.jpgthumbRestoration of [ [ JuramaiaJuramaia sinensis ] ] , the oldest known [ [ Eutheria]]n ( 160 M.Y.A. ) ] ]
The oldest known fossil among the Eutheria ( " true beasts " ) is the small shrewlike [ [ Juramaia Juramaia sinensis ] ] , or " Jurassic mother from China " , dated to 160 million years ago in the late Jurassic .
A later eutherian relative , [ [ Eomaia ] ] , dated to 125 million years ago in the early Cretaceous , possessed some features in common with the marsupials but not with the placentals , evidence that these features were present in the last common ancestor of the two groups but were later lost in the placental lineage .
In particular , the [ [ epipubic bone]]s extend forwards from the pelvis .
These are not found in any modern placental , but they are found in marsupials , monotremes , other nontherian mammals and [ [ Ukhaatherium ] ] , an early Cretaceous animal in the eutherian order [ [ Asioryctitheria ] ] .
This also applies to the multituberculates .
They are apparently an ancestral feature , which subsequently disappeared in the placental lineage .
These epipubic bones seem to function by stiffening the muscles during locomotion , reducing the amount of space being presented , which placentals require to contain their [ [ fetus ] ]
during gestation periods .
A narrow pelvic outlet indicates that the young were very small at birth and therefore [ [ Pregnancy ( mammals)pregnancy ] ] was short , as in modern marsupials .
This suggests that the placenta was a later development .
One of the earliest known monotremes was [ [ Teinolophos ] ] , which lived about 120 million years ago in Australia .
Monotremes have some features which may be inherited from the original amniotes such as the same orifice to urinate , defecate and reproduce ( [ [ cloaca ] ] ) – as lizards and birds also do – and they lay [ [ Egg ( biology)eggs ] ] which are leathery and uncalcified .
EARLIEST APPEARANCES OF FEATURES Section::::Earliest appearances of features .
Hadrocodium , whose fossils date from approximately 195 million years ago , in the early Jurassic , provides the first clear evidence of a jaw joint formed solely by the squamosal and dentary bones ; there is no space in the jaw for the articular , a bone involved in the jaws of all early synapsids .
The earliest clear evidence of hair or fur is in fossils of Castorocauda and [ [ Megaconus ] ] , from 164 million years ago in the mid - Jurassic .
In the 1950s , it was suggested that the foramina ( passages ) in the [ [ maxilla]]e and [ [ premaxilla]]e ( bones in the front of the upper jaw ) of cynodonts were channels which supplied blood vessels and nerves to vibrissae ( [ [ whiskers ] ] )
and so were evidence of hair or fur ; it was soon pointed out , however , that foramina do not necessarily show that an animal had vibrissae , as the modern lizard [ [ Tupinambis ] ] has foramina that are almost identical to those found in the nonmammalian cynodont [ [ Thrinaxodon ] ] .
Popular sources , nevertheless , continue to attribute whiskers to Thrinaxodon .
Studies on Permian [ [ coprolites ] ] suggest that non - mammalian [ [ synapsids ] ]
of the epoch already had fur , setting the evolution of hairs possibly as far back as [ [ dicynodont]]s . When [ [ endothermy ] ]
first appeared in the evolution of mammals is uncertain , though it is generally agreed to have first evolved in non - mammalian [ [ therapsids ] ] .
Modern monotremes have lower body temperatures and more variable metabolic rates than marsupials and placentals , but there is evidence that some of their ancestors , perhaps including ancestors of the therians , may have had body temperatures like those of modern therians .
Likewise , some modern therians like afrotheres and xenarthrans have secondarily developed lower body temperatures .
The evolution of erect limbs in mammals is incomplete — living and fossil monotremes have sprawling limbs .
The parasagittal ( nonsprawling ) limb posture appeared sometime in the late Jurassic or early Cretaceous ; it is found in the eutherian Eomaia and the metatherian Sinodelphys , both dated to 125 million years ago .
[ [ Epipubic ] ]
bones , a feature that strongly influenced the reproduction of most mammal clades , are first found in [ [ Tritylodontidae ] ] , suggesting that it is a synapomorphy between them and [ [ mammaliformes ] ] .
They are omnipresent in non - placental mammaliformes , though [ [ Megazostrodon ] ] and [ [ Erythrotherium ] ] appear to have lacked them .
It has been suggested that the original function of [ [ lactation ] ] ( [ [ milk ] ]
production ) was to keep eggs moist .
Much of the argument is based on monotremes , the egg - laying mammals .
RISE OF THE MAMMALS Section::::Rise of the mammals .
Therian mammals took over the medium- to large - sized ecological niches in the [ [ Cenozoic ] ] , after the [ [ Cretaceous – Paleogene extinction event ] ]
approximately 66 million years ago emptied ecological space once filled by non - avian dinosaurs and other groups of reptiles , as well as various other mammal groups , and underwent an exponential increase in body size ( [ [ megafauna#In terrestrial mammalsmegafauna ] ] ) .
Then mammals diversified very quickly ; both birds and mammals show an exponential rise in diversity .
For example , the earliest known bat dates from about 50 million years ago , only 16 million years after the extinction of the dinosaurs .
Molecular phylogenetic studies initially suggested that most placental orders diverged about 100 to 85 million years ago and that modern families appeared in the period from the late [ [ Eocene ] ] through the [ [ Miocene ] ] .
However , no placental fossils have been found from before the end of the Cretaceous .
The earliest undisputed fossils of placentals comes from the early [ [ Paleocene ] ] , after the extinction of the dinosaurs .
In particular , scientists have identified an early Paleocene animal named [ [ Protungulatum donnae ] ] as one of the first placental mammals .
however it has been reclassified as a non - placental eutherian .
Recalibrations of genetic and morphological diversity rates have suggested a [ [ MaastrichtianLate Cretaceous ] ]
origin for placentals , and a Paleocene origin for most modern clades .
The earliest known ancestor of primates is [ [ Archicebus achilles ] ]
from around 55 million years ago .
This tiny primate weighed 20–30 grams ( 0.7–1.1 ounce ) and could fit within a human palm .
ANATOMY AND MORPHOLOGY DISTINGUISHING FEATURES Section::::Anatomy and morphology .
Section::::Distinguishing features .
Living mammal species can be identified by the presence of [ [ sweat gland]]s , including [ [ Mammary glandthose that are specialized to produce milk ] ] to nourish their young .
In classifying fossils , however , other features must be used , since soft tissue glands and many other features are not visible in fossils .
Many traits shared by all living mammals appeared among the earliest members of the group : *
[ [ JawJaw joint ] ]
-
The [ [ dentary ] ]
( the lower jaw bone , which carries the teeth ) and the [ [ squamosal ] ] ( a small [ [ Craniumcranial ] ] bone ) meet to form the joint .
In most [ [ Gnathostomatagnathostomes ] ] , including early [ [ Therapsidatherapsids ] ] , the joint consists of the [ [ articular ] ] ( a small bone at the back of the lower jaw ) and [ [ Quadrate bonequadrate ] ] ( a small bone at the back of the upper jaw ) .
*
[ [ Middle ear ] ]
-
In crown - group mammals , sound is carried from the [ [ eardrum ] ] by a chain of three bones , the [ [ malleus ] ] , the [ [ incus ] ] and the [ [ stapes ] ] .
Ancestrally , the malleus and the incus are derived from the articular and the quadrate bones that constituted the jaw joint of early therapsids .
*
Tooth replacement - Teeth are replaced once or ( as in toothed whales and [ [ Muridaemurid ] ]
rodents ) not at all , rather than being replaced continually throughout life .
* Prismatic enamel - The [ [ Tooth enamelenamel ] ]
coating on the surface of a tooth consists of prisms , solid , rod - like structures extending from the [ [ dentin ] ] to the tooth 's surface .
*
[ [ Occipital condyle]]s - Two knobs at the base of the skull fit into the topmost [ [ Cervical vertebraeneck vertebra ] ] ; most other [ [ tetrapod]]s , in contrast , have only one such knob .
For the most part , these characteristics were not present in the Triassic ancestors of the mammals .
Nearly all mammaliaforms possess an epipubic bone , the exception being modern placentals .
BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS
Section::::Biological systems .
[ [ File :
Lung expansion simulation with Raccoon.gifthumbleftRaccoon lungs being inflated manually . ] ]
The majority of mammals have seven [ [ cervical vertebrae ] ]
( bones in the neck ) , including [ [ bat]]s , [ [ giraffe]]s , whales and [ [ human]]s .
The exceptions are the [ [ manatee ] ] and the [ [ two - toed sloth ] ] , which have just six , and the [ [ three - toed sloth ] ] which has nine cervical vertebrae .
All mammalian brains possess a [ [ neocortex ] ] , a brain region unique to mammals .
Placental mammals have a [ [ corpus callosum ] ] , unlike monotremes and marsupials .
The [ [ lung]]s of mammals are spongy and honeycombed .
Breathing is mainly achieved with the [ [ diaphragm ( anatomy)diaphragm ] ] , which divides the thorax from the abdominal cavity , forming a dome convex to the thorax .
Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome , increasing the volume of the lung cavity .
Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities , and travels through the larynx , trachea and [ [ bronchi ] ] , and expands the [ [ alveoli ] ] .
Relaxing the diaphragm has the opposite effect , decreasing the volume of the lung cavity , causing air to be pushed out of the lungs .
During exercise , the abdominal wall [ [ Muscle contractioncontracts ] ] , increasing pressure on the diaphragm , which forces air out quicker and more forcefully .
The [ [ rib cage ] ] is able to expand and contract the chest cavity through the action of other respiratory muscles .
Consequently , air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs , always moving down its pressure gradient .
This type of lung is known as a bellows lung due to its resemblance to blacksmith [ [ bellows ] ] .
The mammalian [ [ heart ] ] has four chambers , two upper [ [ atrium ( heart)atria ] ] , the receiving chambers , and two lower [ [ ventricle ( heart)ventricles ] ] , the discharging chambers .
The heart has four valves , which separate its chambers and ensures blood flows in the correct direction through the heart ( preventing backflow ) .
After [ [ gas exchange ] ]
in the pulmonary capillaries ( blood vessels in the lungs ) , oxygen - rich blood returns to the left atrium via one of the four [
[ pulmonary
vein]]s .
Blood flows nearly continuously back into the atrium , which acts as the receiving chamber , and from here through an opening into the left ventricle .
Most blood flows passively into the heart while both the atria and ventricles are relaxed , but toward the end of the [ [ diastoleventricular relaxation period ] ] , the left atrium will contract , pumping blood into the ventricle .
The heart also requires nutrients and oxygen found in blood like other muscles , and is supplied via [ [ coronary circulationcoronary arteries ] ] .
The [ [ skinintegumentary system ] ] is made up of three layers : the outermost
[ [ epidermis ( skin)epidermis ] ] , the [ [ dermis ] ] and the [ [ hypodermis ] ] .
The epidermis is typically 10 to 30 cells thick ; its main function is to provide a waterproof layer .
Its outermost cells are constantly lost ; its bottommost cells are constantly dividing and pushing upward .
The middle layer , the dermis , is 15 to 40 times thicker than the epidermis .
The dermis is made up of many components , such as bony structures and blood vessels .
The hypodermis is made up of [ [ adipose tissue ] ] , which stores lipids and provides cushioning and insulation .
The thickness of this layer varies widely from species to species ; [ [ marine mammal]]s require a thick hypodermis ( [ [ blubber ] ] ) for insulation , and [ [ right whale]]s have the thickest blubber at .
Although other animals have features such as whiskers , [ [ feathers ] ] , [ [ setae ] ] , or [ [ cilia ( entomology)cilia ] ] that superficially resemble it , no animals other than mammals have [ [ hair ] ] .
It is a definitive characteristic of the class .
Though some mammals have very little , careful examination reveals the characteristic , often in obscure parts of their bodies .
Herbivores have developed a diverse range of physical structures to facilitate the [ [ Herbivore adaptations to plant defenseconsumption of plant material ] ] .
To break up intact plant tissues , mammals have developed [ [ teeth ] ]
structures that reflect their feeding preferences .
For instance , [ [ frugivore]]s ( animals that feed primarily on fruit ) and herbivores that feed on soft foliage have low - crowned teeth specialized for grinding foliage and [ [ seed]]s .
[ [ Grazing ] ]
animals that tend to eat hard , [ [ silica]]-rich grasses , have high - crowned teeth , which are capable of grinding tough plant tissues and do not wear down as quickly as low - crowned teeth .
Most carnivorous mammals have [ [ carnassial]]iforme teeth ( of varying length depending on diet ) , long canines and similar tooth replacement patterns .
The stomach of [ [ Even - toed ungulateArtiodactyls ] ] is divided into four sections : the [ [ rumen ] ] , the [ [ Reticulum ( anatomy)reticulum ] ] , the [ [ omasum ] ] and the [ [ abomasum ] ] ( only [ [ ruminant]]s have a rumen ) .
After the plant material is consumed , it is mixed with saliva in the rumen and reticulum and separates into solid and liquid material .
The solids lump together to form a [ [ bolus ( digestion)bolus ] ] ( or [ [ cud ] ] ) , and is regurgitated .
When the bolus enters the mouth , the fluid is squeezed out with the tongue and swallowed again .
Ingested food passes to the rumen and reticulum where cellulytic
[ [ microbe]]s ( [ [ bacteria ] ] , [ [ protozoa ] ] and [ [ Fungusfungi ] ] )
produce [ [ cellulase ] ] , which is needed to break down the [ [ cellulose ] ] in plants .
[ [ Odd - toed ungulatePerissodactyls ] ] , in contrast to the ruminants , store digested food that has left the stomach in an enlarged [ [ cecum ] ] , where it is fermented by bacteria .
Carnivora have a simple stomach adapted to digest primarily meat , as compared to the elaborate digestive systems of herbivorous animals , which are necessary to break down tough , complex plant fibers .
The [ [ caecum ] ] is either absent or short and simple , and the large intestine is not [ [ sacculationsacculated ] ] or much wider than the small intestine .
[ [ File : Glycerination of Bovine kidney.jpgthumbBovine kidney ] ]
The mammalian [ [ excretory system ] ] involves many components .
Like most other land animals , mammals are [ [ ureotelic ] ] , and convert [ [ ammonia ] ] into [ [ urea ] ] , which is done by the [ [ liver ] ] as part of the [ [ urea cycle ] ] .
[ [ Bilirubin ] ] , a waste product derived from [ [ blood cell]]s , is passed through [ [ bile ] ]
and [ [ urine ] ]
with the help of enzymes excreted by the liver .
The passing of bilirubin via bile through the [ [ intestinal tract ] ] gives mammalian [ [ feces ] ]
a distinctive brown coloration .
Distinctive features of the mammalian kidney include the presence of the [ [ renal pelvis ] ]
and [ [ renal pyramid]]s , and of a clearly distinguishable [ [ renal cortexcortex ] ] and [ [ renal medullamedulla ] ] , which is due to the presence of elongated [ [ Loop of Henleloops of Henle ] ] .
Only the mammalian kidney has a bean shape , although there are some exceptions , such as the multilobed [ [ reniculate kidney]]s of pinnipeds , [ [ cetacea]]ns and bears .
Most adult placental mammals have no remaining trace of the [ [ cloaca ] ] .
In the embryo , the [ [ embryonic cloaca ] ]
divides into a posterior region that becomes part of the anus , and an anterior region that has different fates depending on the sex of the individual : in females , it develops into the vestibule that receives the [ [ urethra ] ]
and [ [ vagina ] ] , while in males it forms the entirety of the [ [ penile urethra ] ] .
However , the [ [ tenrec]]s , [ [ golden mole]]s , and some [ [ shrew]]s retain a cloaca as adults .
In marsupials , the genital tract is separate from the anus , but a trace of the original cloaca does remain externally .
Monotremes , which translates from [ [ Ancient GreekGreek ] ] into " single hole " , have a true cloaca .
SOUND PRODUCTION Section::::Sound production .
[ [ File : Animal echolocation.svgthumbupright=1.35A diagram of ultrasonic signals emitted by a bat , and the echo from a nearby object ] ]
As in all other tetrapods , mammals have a [ [ larynx ] ]
that can quickly open and close to produce sounds , and a supralaryngeal [ [ vocal tract ] ]
which filters this sound .
The lungs and surrounding musculature provide the air stream and pressure required to [ [ phonate ] ] .
The larynx controls the [ [ pitch ( music)pitch ] ] and [ [ loudnessvolume ] ] of sound , but the strength the lungs exert to [ [ exhale ] ] also contributes to volume .
More primitive mammals , such as the echidna , can only hiss , as sound is achieved solely through exhaling through a partially closed larynx .
Other mammals phonate using [ [ vocal fold]]s , as opposed to the vocal cords seen in birds and reptiles .
The movement or tenseness of the vocal folds can result in many sounds such as [ [ purr]]ing and [ [ screaming ] ] .
Mammals can change the position of the larynx , allowing them to breathe through the nose while swallowing through the mouth , and to form both oral and [ [ nasalizationnasal ] ]
sounds ; nasal sounds , such as a dog whine , are generally soft sounds , and oral sounds , such as a dog bark , are generally loud .
[ [ File :
Beluga_vocalizations.oggleftthumb[[Beluga whale ] ]
echolocation sounds ] ]
Some mammals have a large larynx and thus a low - pitched voice , namely the [ [ hammer - headed bat ] ]
( Hypsignathus monstrosus ) where the larynx can take up the entirety of the [ [ thoracic cavity ] ]
while pushing the lungs , heart , and trachea into the [ [ abdomen ] ] .
Large vocal pads can also lower the pitch , as in the low - pitched roars of [ [ big cat]]s .
The production of [ [ infrasound ] ] is possible in some mammals such as the [ [ African elephant ] ]
( Loxodonta spp . ) and [ [ baleen
whale]]s .
Small mammals with small larynxes have the ability to produced [ [ ultrasound ] ] , which can be detected by modifications to the [ [ middle ear ] ]
and [ [ cochlea ] ] .
Ultrasound is inaudible to birds and reptiles , which might have been important during the Mesozoic , when birds and reptiles were the dominant predators .
This private channel is used by some rodents in , for example , mother - to - pup communication , and by bats when echolocating .
Toothed whales also use echolocation , but , as opposed to the vocal membrane that extends upward from the vocal folds , they have a [ [ Melon ( cetacean)melon ] ] to manipulate sounds .
Some mammals , namely the primates , have air sacs attached to the larynx , which may function to lower the resonances or increase the volume of sound .
The vocal production system is controlled by the [ [ cranial nerve nucleuscranial nerve nuclei ] ]
in the brain , and supplied by the [ [ recurrent laryngeal nerve ] ]
and the [ [ superior laryngeal nerve ] ] , branches of the [ [ vagus nerve ] ] .
The vocal tract is supplied by the [ [ hypoglossal nerve ] ] and [ [ facial nerve]]s .
Electrical stimulation of the [ [ periaqueductal gray ] ]
( PEG ) region of the mammalian [ [ midbrain ] ]
elicit vocalizations .
The ability to learn new vocalizations is only exemplified in humans , seals , cetaceans , elephants and possibly bats ; in humans , this is the result of a direct connection between the [ [ motor cortex ] ] , which controls movement , and the [ [ motor neuron]]s in the spinal cord .
FUR Section::::Fur .
[ [ File :
Stekelvarken Aiguilles Porc - épic.jpgthumb[[Porcupine]]s use their [ [ spine ( zoology)spines ] ] for defense . ] ]
FUNCTION Section::::Function .
The primary function of the fur of mammals is thermoregulation .
Others include protection , sensory purposes , waterproofing , and camouflage .
TYPES
* Definitive - which may be [ [ moultingshed ] ] after reaching a certain length .
* Vibrissae - sensory hairs , most commonly [ [ whisker]]s . * Elage - guard hairs , under - fur , and [ [ awn hair ] ] .
*
[ [ spine ( zoology)Spines ] ] - stiff guard hair used for defense ( Example : [ [ porcupine]]s ) .
* [ [ Bristle]]s - long hairs usually used in visual signals .
( Example : lion [ [ mane ( lion)mane ] ] ) .
* [ [ Velli ] ] - often called " down fur " which insulates newborn mammals .
*
[ [ Wool ] ] - long , soft and often curly .
THERMOREGULATION Section::::Thermoregulation .
Hair length is not a factor in thermoregulation : for example , some tropical mammals such as sloths have the same length of fur length as some arctic mammals but with less insulation ; and , conversely , other tropical mammals with short hair have the same insulating value as arctic mammals .
The denseness of fur can increase an animal 's insulation value , and arctic mammals especially have dense fur ; for example , the [ [ musk ox ] ]
has guard hairs measuring as well as a dense underfur , which forms an airtight coat , allowing them to survive in temperatures of .
Some desert mammals , such as camels , use dense fur to prevent solar heat from reaching their skin , allowing the animal to stay cool ; a camel 's fur may reach in the summer , but the skin stays at .
[ [ Aquatic mammal]]s , conversely , trap air in their fur to conserve heat by keeping the skin dry .

COLORATION Section::::Coloration .
Mammalian coats are colored for a variety of reasons , the major selective pressures including [ [ camouflage ] ] , [ [ sexual selection ] ] , communication , and thermoregulation .
Camouflage is a powerful influence in a large number of mammals , as it helps to conceal individuals from predators or prey .
In arctic and subarctic mammals such as the [ [ arctic fox ] ]
( Alopex lagopus ) , [ [ collared lemming ] ]
( Dicrostonyx groenlandicus ) , [ [ stoat ] ]
( Mustela erminea ) , and [ [ snowshoe hare ] ]
( Lepus americanus ) , [ [ seasonal polyphenismseasonal color change ] ]
between brown in summer and white in winter is driven largely by camouflage.ome arboreal mammals , notably primates and marsupials , have shades of violet , green , or blue skin on parts of their bodies , indicating some distinct advantage in their largely [ [ arboreal ] ]
habitat due to [ [ convergent evolution ] ] .
The green coloration of sloths , however , is the result of a [ [ symbiosissymbiotic ] ] relationship with [ [ algae ] ] .
[ [ Aposematism ] ] , warning off possible predators , is the most likely explanation of the black - and - white pelage of many mammals which are able to defend themselves , such as in the foul - smelling [ [ skunk ] ] and the powerful and aggressive [ [ honey badger ] ] .
Coat color is sometimes [ [ sexual dimorphismsexually dimorphic ] ] , as in [ [ Sexual dimorphism in non - human primates#Pelage color and markingsmany primate species ] ] .
Differences in female and male coat color may indicate nutrition and hormone levels , important in mate selection .
Coat color may influence the ability to retain heat , depending on how much light is reflected .
Mammals with a darker colored coat can absorb more heat from solar radiation , and stay warmer , and some smaller mammals , such as [ [ vole]]s , have darker fur in the winter .
The white , pigmentless fur of arctic mammals , such as the polar bear , may reflect more solar radiation directly onto the skin .
REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM Section::::Reproductive system .
[ [ File : Goat family.jpgthumbleft[[Goat ] ]
kids stay with their mother until they are weaned . ] ]
The ancestral condition for mammal reproduction is the birthing of relatively undeveloped , either through direct vivipary or a short period as soft - shelled eggs .
This is likely due to the fact that the torso could not expand due to the presence of [ [ epipubic bones ] ] .
The oldest demonstration of this reproductive style is with [ [ Kayentatherium ] ] , which produced undeveloped [ [ perinate]]s , but at much higher litter sizes than any modern mammal , 38 specimens .
In placental mammals , a radical change happened , the conversion of the epipubic into genital [ [ baculum ] ] bones or complete loss ; this allowed the torso to be able to expand and thus produce developed offspring .
In male placentals , the [ [ penis ] ] is used both for urination and copulation .
Depending on the species , an [ [ erection ] ]
may be fueled by blood flow into vascular , spongy tissue or by muscular action .
A penis may be contained in a [ [ Penile sheathsheath ] ]
when not erect , and some placentals also have a penis bone ( [ [ baculum ] ] ) .
Marsupials typically have forked penises while the monotreme penis generally has four heads with only two functioning .
The [ [ testes ] ] of most mammals descend into the [ [ scrotum ] ]
which is typically posterior to the penis but is often anterior in marsupials .
Female mammals generally have a [ [ clitoris ] ] , [ [ labia majora ] ]
and [ [ labia minora ] ]
on the outside , while the internal system contains paired [ [ oviduct]]s , 1 - 2 [ [ uteri ] ] , 1 - 2 [ [ Cervixcervice]]s and a [ [ vagina ] ] .
Marsupials have two lateral vaginas and a medial vagina .
The " vagina " of monotremes is better understood as a " urogenital sinus " .
The uterine systems of placental mammals can vary between a duplex , were there are two uteri and cervices which open into the vagina , a bipartite ,
were two
[ [ uterine horn]]s have a single cervix that connects to the vagina , a bicornuate , which consists where two uterine horns that are connected distally but separate medially creating a Y - shape , and a simplex , which has a single uterus .
[ [ File :
Didelphis virginiana with young .
JPGthumb[[Virginia opossum ] ]
carrying young . ] ]
Most mammals are [ [ viviparityviviparous ] ] , giving birth to live young .
However , the five species of monotreme , the platypus and the four species of echidna , lay eggs .
The monotremes have a [ [ sex determination system ] ]
different from that of most other mammals .
In particular , the [ [ sex chromosome]]s of a platypus are more like those of a chicken than those of a therian mammal .
Viviparous mammals are in the subclass Theria ; those living today are in the marsupial and placental infraclasses .
Marsupials have a short [ [ gestation ] ]
period , typically shorter than its [ [ estrous cycle ] ] and gives birth to an undeveloped newborn that then undergoes further development ; in many species , this takes place within a pouch - like sac , the [ [ Pouch ( marsupial)marsupium ] ] , located in the front of the mother 's [ [ abdomen ] ] .
This is the [ [ Symplesiomorphyplesiomorphic ] ] condition among viviparous mammals ; the presence of epipubic bones in all non - placental mammals prevents the expansion of the torso needed for full pregnancy .
Even non - placental eutherians probably reproduced this way .
The placentals give birth to relatively complete and developed young , usually after long gestation periods .
They get their name from the [ [ placenta ] ] , which connects the developing fetus to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake .
The mammary glands of mammals are specialized to produce milk , the primary source of nutrition for newborns .
The monotremes branched early from other mammals and do not have the [ [ nipple]]s seen in most mammals , but they do have mammary glands .
The young lick the milk from a mammary patch on the mother 's belly .
ENDOTHERMY Section::::Endothermy .
Nearly all mammals are [ [ endothermyendothermic ] ]
( " warm - blooded " ) .
Most mammals also have hair to help keep them warm .
Like birds , mammals can forage or hunt in weather and climates too cold for [ [ ectotherm]]ic ( " cold - blooded " ) reptiles and insects .
Endothermy requires plenty of food energy , so mammals eat more food per unit of body weight than most reptiles .
Small insectivorous mammals eat prodigious amounts for their size .
A rare exception , the [ [ naked mole - rat ] ] produces little metabolic heat , so it is considered an operational [ [ poikilotherm ] ] .
Birds are also endothermic , so endothermy is not unique to mammals .
SPECIES LIFESPAN
Section::::Species lifespan .
Among mammals , species maximum lifespan varies significantly ( for example the [ [ shrew ] ] has a lifespan of two years , whereas the oldest [ [ bowhead whale ] ] is recorded to be 211 years ) .
Although the underlying basis for these lifespan differences is still uncertain , numerous studies indicate that the ability to [ [ DNA repairrepair DNA damages ] ] is an important determinant of mammalian lifespan .
In a 1974 study by Hart and Setlow , it was found that DNA excision repair capability increased systematically with species lifespan among seven mammalian species .
Species lifespan was observed to be robustly correlated with the capacity to recognize DNA double - strand breaks as well as the level of the DNA repair protein [ [ Ku80 ] ] .
In a study of the cells from sixteen mammalian species , genes employed in DNA repair were found to be [ [ Downregulation and upregulationup - regulated ] ]
in the longer - lived species .
The cellular level of the DNA repair enzyme [ [ poly ADP ribose polymerase ] ] was found to correlate with species lifespan in a study of 13 mammalian species .
Three additional studies of a variety of mammalian species also reported a correlation between species lifespan and DNA repair capability .
LOCOMOTION TERRESTRIAL Section::::Locomotion .
Section::::Terrestrial .
[ [ File : Muybridge race horse animated.gifthumb[[runningRunning gait ] ] .
Photographs by [ [ Eadweard Muybridge ] ] , 1887 ] ]
Most vertebrates —
the amphibians , the reptiles and some mammals such as humans and bears — are [ [ plantigrade ] ] , walking on the whole of the underside of the foot .
Many mammals , such as cats and dogs , are [ [ digitigrade ] ] , walking on their toes , the greater stride length allowing more speed .
Digitigrade mammals are also often adept at quiet movement .
Some animals such as [ [ horse]]s are [ [ unguligrade ] ] , walking on the tips of their toes .
This even further increases their stride length and thus their speed .
A few mammals , namely the great apes , are also known to [ [ Knuckle - walkingwalk on their knuckles ] ] , at least for their front legs .
[
[ Giant anteater]]s and platypuses are also knuckle - walkers .
Some mammals are [ [ bipedalismbipeds ] ] , using only two limbs for locomotion , which can be seen in , for example , humans and the great apes .
Bipedal species have a larger field of vision than quadrupeds , conserve more energy and have the ability to manipulate objects with their hands , which aids in foraging .
Instead of walking , some bipeds hop , such as kangaroos and [ [ kangaroo
rat]]s .
Animals will use different gaits for different speeds , terrain and situations .
For example , horses show four natural gaits , the slowest [ [ horse gait ] ] is the [ [ Horse gait#Walkwalk ] ] , then there are three faster gaits which , from slowest to fastest , are the [ [ Trot ( horse gait)trot ] ] , the [ [ canter ] ] and the [ [ Horse gait#Gallopgallop ] ] .
Animals may also have unusual gaits that are used occasionally , such as for moving sideways or backwards .
For example , the main [ [ gait ( human)human gaits ] ] are bipedal [ [ walking ] ] and [ [ running ] ] , but they employ many other gaits occasionally , including a four - legged [ [ crawling ( human)crawl ] ]
in tight spaces .
Mammals show a vast range of [ [ gait]]s , the order that they place and lift their appendages in locomotion .
Gaits can be grouped into categories according to their patterns of support sequence .
For quadrupeds , there are three main categories : walking gaits , running gaits and [ [ leaping gaits ] ] .
Walking is the most common gait , where some feet are on the ground at any given time , and found in almost all legged animals .
Running is considered to occur
when at some points in the stride all feet are off the ground in a moment of suspension .
ARBOREAL Section::::Arboreal .
[ [ File : Brachiating Gibbon ( Some rights reserved).jpgthumbleftupright[[Gibbon]]s are very good [ [ Brachiationbrachiators ] ]
because their elongated limbs enable them to easily swing and grasp on to branches . ] ]
Arboreal animals frequently have elongated limbs that help them cross gaps , reach fruit or other resources , test the firmness of support ahead and , in some cases , to [ [ brachiationbrachiate ] ]
( swing between trees ) .
Many arboreal species , such as tree porcupines , [ [ silky anteater]]s , spider monkeys , and [ [ Phalangeriformespossums ] ]
, use [ [ prehensile tail]]s to grasp branches .
In the spider monkey , the tip of the tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad , which provides increased friction .
Claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and reorient the direction of forces the animal applies .
This is what allows [ [ squirrel]]s to climb tree trunks that are so large to be essentially flat from the perspective of such a small animal .
However , claws can interfere with an animal 's ability to grasp very small branches , as they may wrap too far around and prick the animal 's own paw .
Frictional gripping is used by primates , relying upon hairless fingertips .
Squeezing the branch between the fingertips generates frictional force that holds the animal 's hand to the branch .
However , this type of grip depends upon the angle of the frictional force , thus upon the diameter of the branch , with larger branches resulting in reduced gripping ability .
To control descent , especially down large diameter branches , some arboreal animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating the foot into a ' reversed ' posture .
This allows the claws to hook into the rough surface of the bark , opposing the force of gravity .
Small size provides many advantages to arboreal species : such as increasing the relative size of branches to the animal , lower center of mass , increased stability , lower mass ( allowing movement on smaller branches ) and the ability to move through more cluttered habitat .
Size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as the [ [ sugar glider ] ] .
Some species of primate , bat and all species of [ [ sloth ] ] achieve passive stability by hanging beneath the branch .
Both pitching and tipping become irrelevant , as the only method of failure would be losing their grip .
AERIAL Section::::Aerial .
[ [ File : Israeli Bats - 26 September 2015.webmthumbupright=1.35Slow-motion and normal speed of [ [ Egyptian fruit bat]]s flying ] ]
Bats are the only mammals that can truly fly .
They fly through the air at a constant speed by moving their wings up and down ( usually with some fore - aft movement as well ) .
Because the animal is in motion , there is some airflow relative to its body which , combined with the velocity of the wings , generates a faster airflow moving over the wing .
This generates a lift force vector pointing forwards and upwards , and a drag force vector pointing rearwards and upwards .
The upwards components of these counteract gravity , keeping the body in the air , while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole .
The wings of bats are much thinner and consist of more bones than that of birds , allowing bats to maneuver more accurately and fly with more lift and less drag .
By folding the wings inwards towards their body on the upstroke , they use 35 % less energy during flight than birds .
The membranes are delicate , ripping easily ; however , the tissue of the bat 's membrane is able to regrow , such that small tears can heal quickly .
The surface of their wings is equipped with touch - sensitive receptors on small bumps called [ [ Merkel cell]]s , also found on human fingertips .
These sensitive areas are different in bats , as each bump has a tiny hair in the center , making it even more sensitive and allowing the bat to detect and collect information about the air flowing over its wings , and to fly more efficiently by changing the shape of its wings in response .
FOSSORIAL Section::::Fossorial .
Fossorial creatures live in subterranean environments .
Many fossorial mammals were classified under the , now obsolete , order [ [ Insectivora ] ] , such as shrews , hedgehogs and moles .
Fossorial mammals have a fusiform body , thickest at the shoulders and tapering off at the tail and nose .
Unable to see in the dark burrows , most have degenerated eyes , but degeneration varies between species ; [ [ pocket gopher]]s , for example , are only semi - fossorial and have very small yet functional eyes , in the fully fossorial [ [ marsupial mole ] ]
the eyes are degenerated and useless , [ [ Talpa ( genus)talpa moles ] ] have [ [ vestigial ] ]
eyes and the [ [ cape golden mole ] ] has a layer of skin covering the eyes .
External ears flaps are also very small or absent .
Truly fossorial mammals have short , stout legs as strength is more important than speed to a burrowing mammal , but semi - fossorial mammals have [ [ cursorial ] ] legs .
The front paws are broad and have strong claws to help in loosening dirt while excavating burrows , and the back paws have webbing , as well as claws , which aids in throwing loosened dirt backwards .
Most have large incisors to prevent dirt from flying into their mouth .
AQUATIC Section::::Aquatic .
[ [ File : Living - on - the - Edge - Settlement - Patterns - by - the - Symbiotic - Barnacle - Xenobalanus - globicipitis - on - Small - pone.0127367.s001.ogvthumbA pod of [ [ short - beaked common dolphin]]s swimming ] ]
Fully aquatic mammals , the cetaceans and [ [ sirenia]]ns , have lost their legs and have a tail fin to propel themselves through the water .
Flipper movement is continuous .
Whales swim by moving their tail fin and lower body up and down , propelling themselves through vertical movement , while their flippers are mainly used for steering .
Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers .
Most species have a [ [ dorsal fin ] ]
to prevent themselves from turning upside - down in the water .
The flukes of sirenians are raised up and down in long strokes to move the animal forward , and can be twisted to turn .
The forelimbs are paddle - like flippers which aid in turning and slowing .
[ [ List of semiaquatic tetrapodsSemi - aquatic ] ]
mammals , like pinnipeds , have two pairs of flippers on the front and back , the fore - flippers and hind - flippers .
The elbows and ankles are enclosed within the body .
Pinnipeds have several adaptions for reducing [ [ Drag ( physics)drag ] ] .
In addition to their streamlined bodies , they have smooth networks of [ [ Muscle fasciclemuscle bundles ] ]
in their skin that may increase [ [ laminar flow ] ] and make it easier for them to slip through water .
They also lack [ [ Arrector pili musclearrector pili ] ] , so their fur can be streamlined as they swim .
They rely on their fore - flippers for locomotion in a wing - like manner similar to [ [ penguin]]s and [ [ sea turtles ] ] .
Fore - flipper movement is not continuous , and the animal glides between each stroke .
Compared to terrestrial carnivorans , the fore - limbs are reduced in length , which gives the locomotor muscles at the shoulder and elbow joints greater mechanical advantage ; the hind - flippers serve as stabilizers .
Other semi - aquatic mammals include beavers , [ [ hippopotamus]]es , [ [ otter]]s and platypuses .
Hippos are very large semi - aquatic mammals , and their barrel - shaped bodies have [ [ wikt : graviportalgraviportal ] ]
skeletal structures , adapted to carrying their enormous weight , and their [ [ specific gravity ] ] allows them to sink and move along the bottom of a river .
BEHAVIOR COMMUNICATION AND VOCALIZATION Section::::Behavior . Section::::Communication and vocalization .
[ [ File : Monkey & Baby .
JPGthumbupright[[Vervet monkey]]s use at least four distinct [ [ alarm signalalarm calls ] ] for different [ [ predator]]s . ] ]
Many mammals communicate by vocalizing .
Vocal communication serves many purposes , including in mating rituals , as [ [ alarm signalwarning calls ] ] , to indicate food sources , and for social purposes .
Males often call during mating rituals to ward off other males and to attract females , as in the [ [ roar ( vocalization)roaring ] ] of [ [ lion]]s and [ [ red deer ] ] .
The [ [ whale songsongs ] ]
of the humpback whale may be signals to females ; they have different dialects in different regions of the ocean .
Social vocalizations include the [ [ territory ( animal)territorial ] ] calls of [ [ gibbon]]s , and the use of frequency in [ [ greater spear - nosed bat]]s to distinguish between groups .
The [ [ vervet monkey ] ]
gives a distinct alarm call for each of at least four different predators , and the reactions of other monkeys vary according to the call .
For example , if an alarm call signals a python , the monkeys climb into the trees , whereas the eagle alarm causes monkeys to seek a hiding place on the ground .
[ [ Prairie dogs ] ]
similarly have complex calls that signal the type , size , and speed of an approaching predator .
Elephants communicate socially with a variety of sounds including snorting , screaming , trumpeting , roaring and rumbling .
Some of the rumbling calls are [ [ infrasoundinfrasonic ] ] , below the hearing range of humans , and can be heard by other elephants up to away at still times near sunrise and sunset .
[ [ file : Killer_whale.oggleftthumbOrca
calling including occasional echolocation clicks . ] ]
Mammals signal by a variety of means .
Many give visual [ [ Anti - predator adaptationanti - predator signals ] ] , as when deer and [ [ gazelle ] ]
[ [ stottingstot ] ] , [ [ honest signalhonestly indicating ] ]
their fit condition and their ability to escape , or when [ [ white - tailed deer ] ] and other prey mammals flag with conspicuous tail markings when alarmed , informing the predator that it has been detected .
Many mammals make use of [ [ scent - marking ] ] , sometimes possibly to help defend territory , but probably with a range of functions both within and between species .
[ [ Microbat]]s and [ [ toothed whale]]s including [ [ oceanic dolphin]]s vocalize both socially and in [ [ Animal echolocationecholocation ] ] .
FEEDING Section::::Feeding .
[ [ File : Myresluger2.jpgthumbThe [ [ insectivorous ] ]
[ [ giant anteater ] ] eats some 30,000 insects per day . ] ]
To maintain a high constant body temperature is energy expensive – mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet .
While the earliest mammals were probably predators , different species have since adapted to meet their dietary requirements in a variety of ways .
Some eat other animals – this is a [ [ carnivorecarnivorous ] ]
diet ( and includes insectivorous diets ) .
Other mammals , called [ [ herbivore]]s , eat plants , which contain [ [ complex carbohydrate]]s such as cellulose .
An herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as [ [ granivory ] ] ( seed eating ) , [ [ folivory ] ] ( leaf eating ) , [ [ frugivory ] ] ( fruit eating ) , [ [ nectarivory ] ] ( nectar eating ) , [ [ gummivory ] ] ( gum eating ) and [ [ mycophagy ] ] ( fungus eating ) .
The digestive tract of an herbivore is host to bacteria that ferment these complex substances , and make them available for digestion , which are either housed in the multichambered [ [ stomach ] ]
or in a large cecum .
Some mammals are [ [ coprophagous ] ] , consuming [ [ feces ] ] to absorb the nutrients not digested when the food was first ingested .
An [ [ omnivore ] ] eats both prey and plants .
Carnivorous mammals have a simple [ [ digestive systemdigestive tract ] ]
because the [ [ protein]]s , [ [ lipid]]s and [ [ mineral]]s found in meat require little in the way of specialized digestion .
Exceptions to this include [ [ baleen whale]]s who also house [ [ gut flora ] ]
in a multi - chambered stomach , like terrestrial herbivores .
The size of an animal is also a factor in determining diet type ( [ [ Allen 's rule ] ] ) .
Since small mammals have a high ratio of heat - losing surface area to heat - generating volume , they tend to have high energy requirements and a high [ [ metabolismmetabolic rate ] ] .
Mammals that weigh less than about are mostly insectivorous because they can not tolerate the slow , complex digestive process of an herbivore .
Larger animals , on the other hand , generate more heat and less of this heat is lost .
They can therefore tolerate either a slower collection process ( carnivores that feed on larger vertebrates ) or a slower digestive process ( herbivores ) .
Furthermore , mammals that weigh more than usually can not collect enough insects during their waking hours to sustain themselves .
The only large insectivorous mammals are those that feed on huge colonies of insects
( [ [ ant]]s or [ [ termite]]s ) .
Some mammals are omnivores and display varying degrees of carnivory and herbivory , generally leaning in favor of one more than the other .
Since plants and meat are digested differently , there is a preference for one over the other , as in bears where some species may be mostly carnivorous and others mostly herbivorous .
They are grouped into three categories : [ [ mesocarnivoremesocarnivory ] ]
( 50 - 70 % meat ) , [ [ hypercarnivorehypercarnivory ] ] ( 70 % and greater of meat ) , and [ [ hypocarnivorehypocarnivory ] ] ( 50 % or less of meat ) .
The dentition of hypocarnivores consists of dull , triangular carnassial teeth meant for grinding food .
Hypercarnivores , however , have conical teeth and sharp carnassials meant for slashing , and in some cases strong jaws for bone - crushing , as in the case of [ [ hyena]]s , allowing them to consume bones ; some extinct groups , notably the [ [ Machairodontinae ] ] , had saber - shaped [ [ maxillary caninecanines ] ] .
Some physiological carnivores consume plant matter and
some physiological herbivores consume meat .
From a behavioral aspect , this would make them omnivores , but from the physiological standpoint , this may be due to [ [ zoopharmacognosy ] ] .
Physiologically , animals must be able to obtain both energy and nutrients from plant and animal materials to be considered omnivorous .
Thus , such animals are still able to be classified as carnivores and herbivores when they are just obtaining nutrients from materials originating from sources that do not seemingly complement their classification .
For example , it is well documented that some ungulates .
such as giraffes , camels , and cattle , will gnaw on bones to consume particular minerals and nutrients .
Also , cats , which are generally regarded as obligate carnivores , occasionally eat grass to regurgitate indigestible material ( such as [ [ hairball]]s ) , aid with hemoglobin production , and as a laxative .
Many mammals , in the absence of sufficient food requirements in an environment , suppress their metabolism and conserve energy in a process known as [ [ hibernation ] ] .
In the period preceding hibernation , larger mammals , such as bears , become [ [ polyphagic ] ]
to increase fat stores , whereas smaller mammals prefer to collect and stash food .
The slowing of the metabolism is accompanied by a decreased heart and respiratory rate , as well as a drop in internal temperatures , which can be around ambient temperature in some cases .
For example , the internal temperatures of hibernating [ [ arctic ground squirrel]]s can drop to , however the head and neck always stay above .
A few mammals in hot environments [ [ aestivate ] ]
in times of drought or extreme heat , namely the [ [ fat - tailed dwarf lemur ] ]
( Cheirogaleus medius ) .
INTELLIGENCE Section::::Intelligence .
In intelligent mammals , such as primates , the [ [ cerebrum ] ] is larger relative to the rest of the brain .
[ [ Intelligence ] ]
itself is not easy to define , but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn , matched with behavioral flexibility .
[ [ Rat IQRats ] ] , for example , are considered to be highly intelligent , as they can learn and perform new tasks , an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh [ [ biomehabitat ] ] .
In some mammals , food gathering appears to be related to intelligence : a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat , which must think to outwit its prey .
[ [ File : A Bonobo at the San Diego Zoo " fishing " for termites.jpgthumbA [ [ bonobo ] ]

[ [ Tool use by animals ] ] may indicate different levels of [ [ learning ] ]
and [ [ Animal cognitioncognition ] ] .
The [ [ Tool use by sea otterssea otter ] ] uses rocks as essential and regular parts of its foraging behaviour ( smashing [ [ abalone ] ] from rocks or breaking open shells ) , with some populations spending 21 % of their time making tools .
Other tool use , such as [ [ chimpanzee]]s using twigs to " fish " for termites , may be developed by [ [ Observational learningwatching others use tools ] ] and may even be a true example of animal teaching .
Tools may even be used in solving puzzles in which the animal appears to experience a [ [ Eureka effect"Eureka moment " ] ] .
Other mammals that do not use tools , such as dogs , can also experience a Eureka moment .
[ [ Brain size ] ] was previously considered a major indicator of the intelligence of an animal .
Since most of the brain is used for maintaining bodily functions , greater ratios of [ [ Brain - to - body mass ratiobrain to body mass ] ]
may increase the amount of brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks .
[ [ Allometric ] ]
analysis indicates that mammalian brain size scales at approximately the ⅔ or ¾ exponent of the body mass .
Comparison of a particular animal 's brain size with the expected brain size based on such allometric analysis provides an [ [ encephalization quotientencephalisation quotient ] ]
that can be used as another indication of animal intelligence .
[ [ Sperm whale]]s have the largest brain mass of any animal on earth , averaging and in mature males .
[ [ Self - awareness ] ] appears to be a sign of abstract thinking .
Self - awareness , although not well - defined , is believed to be a precursor to more advanced processes such as [ [ metacognitionmetacognitive reasoning ] ] .
The traditional method for measuring this is the [ [ mirror test ] ] , which determines if an animal possesses the ability of self - recognition .
Mammals that have ' passed ' the mirror test include Asian elephants ( some pass , some do not ) ; chimpanzees ; bonobos ; orangutans ; humans , from 18 months ( [ [ mirror stage ] ] ) ; bottlenose dolphins killer whales ; and false killer whales .
SOCIAL STRUCTURE Section::::Social structure .
[ [ File :
Borneo elephants.pngthumbFemale elephants live in stable groups , along with their offspring . ] ]
[ [ Eusociality ] ] is the highest level of social organization .
These societies have an overlap of adult generations , the division of reproductive labor and cooperative caring of young .
Usually insects , such as [ [ bee]]s , ants and termites , have eusocial behavior , but it is demonstrated in two rodent species : the naked mole - rat and the [ [ Damaraland mole - rat ] ] .
Presociality is when animals exhibit more than just sexual interactions with members of the same species , but fall short of qualifying as eusocial .
That is , presocial animals can display communal living , cooperative care of young , or primitive division of reproductive labor , but they do not display all of the three essential traits of eusocial animals .
Humans and some species of [ [ Callitrichidae ] ]
( [ [ marmoset]]s and [ [ tamarin]]s ) are unique among primates in their degree of cooperative care of young .
[ [ Harry Harlow ] ] set up an experiment with [ [ rhesus monkey]]s , presocial primates , in 1958 ; the results from this study showed that social encounters are necessary in order for the young monkeys to develop both mentally and sexually .
A [ [ fission - fusion society ] ] is a society that changes frequently in its size and composition , making up a permanent social group called the " parent group " .
Permanent social networks consist of all individual members of a community and often varies to track changes in their environment .
In a fission – fusion society , the main parent group can fracture ( fission ) into smaller stable subgroups or individuals to adapt to [ [ Social environmentenvironmental ] ] or social circumstances .
For example , a number of males may break off from the main group in order to hunt or forage for food during the day , but at night they may return to join ( fusion ) the primary group to share food and partake in other activities .
Many mammals exhibit this , such as primates ( for example orangutans and [ [ spider monkey]]s ) , elephants , [ [ spotted hyena]]s , lions , and dolphins .
Solitary animals defend a territory and avoid social interactions with the members of its species , except during breeding season .
This is to avoid resource competition , as two individuals of the same species would occupy the same niche , and to prevent depletion of food .
A solitary animal , while foraging , can also be less conspicuous to predators or prey .
[ [ File:- fighting

" boxing " for [ [ dominance hierarchydominance ] ] ] ]
In a [ [ dominance hierarchyhierarchy ] ] , individuals are either dominant or submissive .
A despotic hierarchy is where one individual is dominant while the others are submissive , as in wolves and lemurs , and a [ [ pecking order ] ] is a linear ranking of individuals where there is a top individual and a bottom individual .
Pecking orders may also be ranked by sex , where the lowest individual of a sex has a higher ranking than the top individual of the other sex , as in hyenas .
Dominant individuals , or alphas , have a high chance of reproductive success , especially in [ [ harem ( zoology)harems ] ]
where one or a few males ( resident males ) have exclusive breeding rights to females in a group .
Non - resident males can also be accepted in harems , but some species , such as the [ [ common vampire bat ] ] ( Desmodus rotundus ) , may be more strict .
Some mammals are perfectly [ [ Monogamy in animalsmonogamous ] ] , meaning that they [ [ pair bondmate for life ] ] and take no other partners ( even after the original mate 's death ) , as with wolves , [ [ Eurasian beaver]]s , and otters .
There are three types of polygamy : either one or multiple dominant males have breeding rights ( [ [ polygyny in animalspolygyny ] ] ) , multiple males that females mate with ( polyandry ) , or multiple males have exclusive relations with multiple females ( polygynandry ) .
It is much more common for polygynous mating to happen , which , excluding [ [ lek matingleks ] ] , are estimated to occur in up to 90 % of mammals .
Lek mating occurs when males congregate around females and try to attract them with various [ [ courtship display]]s and vocalizations , as in harbor seals .
All
[ [ higher mammal]]s ( excluding monotremes ) share two major adaptations for care of the young : live birth and lactation .
These imply a group - wide choice of a degree of [ [ parental care ] ] .
They may build nests and dig burrows to raise their young in , or feed and guard them often for a prolonged period of time .
Many mammals are [ [ K - selected ] ] , and invest more time and energy into their young than do [ [ r - selected ] ] animals .
When two animals mate , they both share an interest in the success of the offspring , though often to different extremes .
Mammalian females exhibit some degree of maternal aggression , another example of parental care , which may be targeted against other females of the species or the young of other females ; however , some mammals may " aunt " the infants of other females , and care for them .
Mammalian males may play a role in child rearing , as with tenrecs , however this varies species to species , even within the same genus .
For example , the males of the [ [ southern pig - tailed macaque ] ]
( Macaca nemestrina ) do not participate in child care , whereas the males of the [ [ Japanese macaque ] ]
( M. fuscata ) do .
HUMANS AND OTHER MAMMALS IN HUMAN CULTURE Section::::Humans and other mammals .
Section::::In human culture .
[ [ File : Lascaux painting.jpgthumb[[Upper Paleolithic ] ]
[ [ cave painting ] ] of a variety of large mammals , [ [ Lascaux ] ] , c. 17,300 years old ] ] Non - human mammals play a wide variety of roles in human culture .
They are the most popular of [ [ pet]]s , with tens of millions of dogs , cats and other animals including [ [ rabbit]]s and mice kept by families around the world .
Mammals such as [ [ mammoth]]s , horses and deer are among the earliest subjects of art , being found in [ [ Upper Paleolithic ] ]
[ [ cave painting]]s such as at [ [ Lascaux ] ] .
Major artists such as [ [ Albrecht Dürer ] ] , [ [ George Stubbs ] ] and [ [ Edwin Landseer ] ] are known for their portraits of mammals .
Many species of mammals have been [ [ huntinghunted ] ] for sport and for food ; deer and [ [ wild boar ] ] are especially popular as [ [ game ( hunting)game animals ] ] .
Mammals such as [ [ horse racinghorses ] ] and [ [ greyhound racingdogs ] ]
are widely raced for sport , often combined with [ [ gamblingbetting on the outcome ] ] .
There is a tension between the role of animals as companions to humans , and their existence as individuals with [ [ animal rightsrights of their own ] ] .
Mammals further play a wide variety of roles in literature , film , mythology , and religion .
USES AND IMPORTANCE Section::::Uses and importance .
[ [ File : Hand milking a cow at Cobbes Farm Museum.jpgthumbleftupright[[Cattle ] ] have been [ [ Dairy farmingkept for milk ] ] for thousands of years . ] ]
[ [ DomesticationDomestic ] ]
mammals form a large part of the [ [ livestock ] ]
raised for [ [ meat ] ]
across the world .
They include ( 2009 ) around 1.4 billion [ [ cattle ] ] , 1 billion [ [ sheep ] ] , 1 billion [ [ domestic pig]]s , and ( 1985 ) over 700 million rabbits .
[ [ Working animalWorking domestic animals ] ] including cattle and horses have been used for work and [ [ transport ] ]
from the origins of agriculture , their numbers declining with the arrival of mechanised transport and [ [ agricultural machinery ] ] .
In 2004 they still provided some 80 % of the power for the mainly small farms in the third world , and some 20 % of the world 's transport , again mainly in rural areas .
In mountainous regions unsuitable for wheeled vehicles , [ [ pack animal]]s continue to transport goods .
Mammal skins provide [ [ leather ] ] for [ [ shoe]]s , [ [ clothing ] ] and [ [ upholstery ] ] .
[ [ Wool ] ]
from mammals including sheep , goats and
[ [ alpaca]]s has been used for centuries for clothing .
Mammals serve a major role in science as [ [ animal modelexperimental animals ] ] , both in fundamental biological research , such as in genetics , and in the development of new medicines , which must be tested exhaustively to demonstrate their [ [ Pharmacovigilancesafety ] ] .
Millions of mammals , especially mice and rats , are used in [ [ animal testingexperiments ] ]
each year .
A [ [ knockout mouse ] ] is a [ [ genetically modified mouse ] ] with an inactivated [ [ gene ] ] , replaced or disrupted with an artificial piece of DNA .
They enable the study of [ [ sequencingsequenced ] ] genes whose functions are unknown .
A small percentage of the mammals are non - human primates , used in research for their similarity to humans .
[ [ Charles Darwin ] ] , [ [ Jared Diamond ] ]
and others have noted the importance of domesticated mammals in the [ [ Neolithic revolutionNeolithic development of agriculture ] ]
and of [ [ civilization ] ] , causing farmers to replace [ [ hunter - gatherer]]s around the world .
This transition from hunting and gathering to [ [ pastoralismherding flocks ] ]
and [ [ agriculturegrowing crops ] ] was a major step in human history .
The new agricultural economies , based on domesticated mammals , caused " radical restructuring of human societies , worldwide alterations in biodiversity , and significant changes in the Earth 's landforms and its atmosphere ... momentous outcomes " .
HYBRIDS Section::::Hybrids .
Hybrids are offspring resulting from the breeding of two genetically distinct individuals , which usually will result in a high degree of heterozygosity , though hybrid and heterozygous are not synonymous .
The deliberate or accidental hybridizing of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has grown for economic purposes .
Hybrids between different subspecies within a species ( such as between the [ [ Bengal tiger ] ] and [ [ Siberian tiger ] ] ) are known as intra - specific hybrids .
Hybrids between different species within the same genus ( such as between lions and tigers ) are known as interspecific hybrids or crosses .
Hybrids between different genera ( such as between sheep and goats ) are known as intergeneric hybrids .
Natural hybrids will occur in [ [ hybrid zone]]s , where two populations of species within the same genera or species living in the same or adjacent areas will interbreed with each other .
Some hybrids have been recognized as species , such as the [ [ red wolf ] ]
( though this is controversial ) .
[ [ Artificial selection ] ] , the deliberate [ [ selective breeding ] ] of domestic animals , is being used to [ [ breeding backbreed back ] ]
[ [ Holocene extinctionrecently extinct ] ] animals in an attempt to achieve an animal breed with a [ [ phenotype ] ]
that resembles that extinct [ [ wildtype ] ] ancestor .
A breeding - back ( intraspecific ) hybrid may be very similar to the extinct wildtype in appearance , ecological niche and to some extent genetics , but the initial [ [ gene pool ] ] of that wild type is lost forever with its [ [ extinction ] ] .
As a result , bred - back breeds are at best vague look - alikes of extinct wildtypes , as [ [ Heck cattle ] ] are of the [ [ aurochs ] ] .
[ [ Purebred ] ]
wild species evolved to a specific ecology can be threatened with extinction through the process of [ [ genetic pollution ] ] , the uncontrolled hybridization , [ [ introgression ] ]
genetic swamping which leads to homogenization or [ [ Fitness ( biology)out - competition ] ]
from the [ [ heterosisheterosic ] ] hybrid species .
When new populations are imported or selectively bred by people , or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact , extinction in some species , especially rare varieties , is possible .
[ [ Interbreeding ] ]
can swamp the rarer gene pool and create hybrids , depleting the purebred gene pool .
For example , the endangered [ [ wild water buffalo ] ]
is most threatened with extinction by genetic pollution from the [ [ Water buffalodomestic water buffalo ] ] .
Such extinctions are not always apparent from a [ [ morphology ( biology)morphological ] ] standpoint .
Some degree of [ [ gene flow ] ] is a normal evolutionary process , nevertheless , hybridization threatens the existence of rare species .
THREATS Section::::Threats .
[ [ File : Extinctions Africa Austrailia NAmerica Madagascar.gifthumbupright=1.4Biodiversity of large mammal species per continent before and
after humans arrived there ] ]
The loss of species from ecological communities , [ [ defaunation ] ] , is primarily driven by human activity .
This has resulted in [ [ empty forest]]s , ecological communities depleted of large vertebrates .
In the [ [ Quaternary extinction event ] ] , the mass die - off of [ [ megafauna]]l variety coincided with the appearance of humans , suggesting a human influence .
One hypothesis is that humans hunted large mammals , such as the [ [ woolly mammoth ] ] , into extinction .
Various species are predicted to [ [ List of critically endangered speciesbecome extinct in the near future ] ] , among them the [ [ rhinoceros ] ] , [ [ primates ] ] , [ [ pangolins ] ] , and [ [ giraffes ] ] .
Hunting alone threatens hundreds of mammalian species around the world .
Scientists claim that the growing demand for [ [ meat ] ] is contributing to biodiversity loss as this is a significant driver of [ [ deforestation ] ]
and [ [ habitat destruction ] ] ; species - rich habitats , such as significant portions of the [ [ Amazon rainforest ] ] , are being converted to agricultural land for meat production .
According to the [ [ World Wildlife Fund ] ] 's 2016
[ [ Living Planet Index ] ] , global wildlife populations have declined 58 % since 1970 , primarily due to habitat destruction , over - hunting and pollution .
They project that if current trends continue , 67 % of wildlife could disappear by 2020 .
Another influence is over - hunting and [ [ Species affected by poachingpoaching ] ] , which can reduce the overall population of game animals , especially those located near villages , as in the case of [ [ peccarypeccaries ] ] .
The effects of poaching can especially be seen in the [ [ ivory trade ] ] with African elephants .
Marine mammals are at risk from entanglement from fishing gear , notably [ [ Cetacean bycatchcetaceans ] ] , with discard mortalities ranging from 65,000 to 86,000 individuals annually .
Attention is being given to endangered species globally , notably through the [ [ Convention on Biological Diversity ] ] , otherwise known as the Rio Accord , which includes 189 signatory countries that are focused on identifying endangered species and habitats .
Another notable conservation organization is the IUCN , which has a membership of over 1,200 governmental and [ [ Non - governmental organizationnon - governmental ] ] organizations .
[ [ List of recently extinct mammalsRecent extinctions ] ] can be directly attributed to human influences .
The IUCN characterizes ' recent ' extinction as those that have occurred past the cut - off point of 1500 , and around 80 mammal species have gone extinct since that time and 2015 .
Some species , such as the [ [ Père David 's deer ] ] are [ [ extinct in the wild ] ] , and survive solely in captive populations .
Other species , such as the [ [ Florida panther ] ] , are [ [ Ecological extinctionecologically extinct ] ] , surviving in such low numbers that they essentially have no impact on the ecosystem .
Other populations are only [ [ Local extinctionlocally extinct ] ]
( extirpated ) , still existing elsewhere , but reduced in distribution , as with the extinction of [ [ gray whale]]s in the [ [ Atlantic OceanAtlantic ] ] .
