PLOT Section::::Plot .
In a flashback , King Harold and Queen Lillian are about to sign the kingdom of Far Far Away over to Rumpelstiltskin , in exchange for lifting their daughter 's curse .
The deal is abruptly cancelled at the last second when a knight informs the King and Queen that Princess Fiona has been rescued by Shrek .
An angry Rumpelstiltskin laments his loss and wishes that Shrek was never born .
In the present time , Shrek has grown steadily weary of being a family man and celebrity among the local villagers , leading him to wish for when he felt like a " real ogre " again .
When he takes his family to Far Far Away to celebrate his children 's first birthday , a series of mishaps further injure his ego , causing him to lose his temper and walk out in anger .
Shrek encounters Rumpelstiltskin , who seizes his chance , having observed Shrek 's angry outburst .
He follows Shrek and arranges for him to appear to save his life .
He gives Shrek a day to live like a real ogre , in exchange for a day from his childhood that he would not remember being erased to " thank " him .
Shrek signs the contract and appears in an alternate reality where the events starting from Fiona 's rescue are irrelevant .
Now feared by villagers , he takes the opportunity to cause some lighthearted mischief until he finds " WANTED " posters for Fiona and his home deserted and desolate .
He is kidnapped by witches and taken to Rumpel , now the King of Far Far Away , which has become derelict and run down .
Upon inquiry , Rumpel reveals that he took away the day Shrek was born .
Therefore , Shrek never saved Fiona or met Donkey , and consequently Rumpel was able to trick King Harold and Queen Lillian into signing their kingdom over to him , making them both disappear .
When the day ends , Shrek will disappear as well as he was never born in this timeline .
Shrek escapes Rumpel 's castle with Donkey .
Initially terrified of Shrek , Donkey decides to trust him after seeing Shrek cry over his erased history , something he had never seen an ogre do before .
After Shrek explains the situation , Donkey helps him find a hidden exit clause : the contract can be nullified by " true love 's kiss " .
They soon encounter an army of ogres who are resisting Rumpel .
The ogres are led by a still - cursed Fiona who , after escaping from the tower where she was held captive , keeps the retired and overweight Puss in Boots as a pet .
Shrek does everything he can to gain Fiona 's love , but she is too busy preparing an ambush on Rumpel .
She is also bitterly cynical and disillusioned about the power of true love and throws herself into planning Rumpel 's capture .
While sparring with her , Fiona begins to like Shrek , but stops short of kissing him .
Puss encourages him to continue pursuing Fiona .
During the ambush , the ogres are captured by the Pied Piper , though Shrek and Fiona escape with the intervention of Puss and Donkey .
Shrek insists Fiona kiss him , saying it will fix everything ; however , because in this altered timeline Fiona does not truly love him , the kiss does not work .
When he hears that Rumpel is offering a wish to the one who brings him Shrek , Shrek turns himself in and uses the wish to free the other ogres .
Afterwards , Rumpel reveals a captured Fiona whom he is going to feed to Dragon along with Shrek .
Donkey leads the Ogre army to storm the castle , battle the witches , and capture Rumpel , while Shrek and Fiona trap Dragon .
As the sun rises , Shrek begins to fade from existence , but Fiona , having fallen in love with him , kisses Shrek just before he disappears , restoring Shrek to his world just before he lashed out at the party .
Shrek embraces his friends and family with a newfound appreciation for everything he has .

Klausner , about the script 's evolution , said , " When I first came onto the project , it was n't supposed to be the final chapter â€” there were originally going to be 5 Shrek movies .
Then , about a year into the development , Jeffrey Katzenberg decided that the story that we 'd come up with was the right way for Shrek 's journey to end , which was incredibly flattering . "

CRITICAL RESPONSE

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , Shrek Forever After has an approval rating of 58 % based on 191 reviews , with an average rating of 5.9/10 .
The site 's critical consensus reads , " While not without its moments , Shrek Forever After too often feels like a rote rehashing of the franchise 's earlier entries .
"
On Metacritic , the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100 , based on 35 critics , indicating " mixed or average reviews " .
Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of " A " on an A+ to F scale , the same score earned by Shrek and Shrek 2 .
Stephen Holden of The New York Times stated " What fortifies " Shrek
Forever After " are its brilliantly realized principal characters , who nearly a decade after the first " Shrek " film remain as vital and engaging fusions of image , personality and voice as any characters in the history of animation .
"
Pete Hammond of BoxOffice gave the film 4.5 stars out of 5 , writing " Hilarious and heartfelt from start to finish , this is the best Shrek of them all , and that 's no fairy tale .
Borrowing liberally from
Frank Capra 's It 's a Wonderful Life , this edition blends big laughs and emotion to explore what Far Far Away might have been like if Shrek never existed .
"
James Berardinelli of Reelviews awarded the film 3 out of 4 stars and wrote " Even though Shrek Forever After is obligatory and unnecessary , it 's better than Shrek the Third
and it 's likely that most who attend as a way of saying goodbye to the Jolly Green Ogre will not find themselves wishing they had sought out a more profitable way of spending 90-odd minutes . "
James White of Empire gave the film four out of four stars , saying " DreamWorks could be entering a period of fresh creativity .
With How To Train Your Dragon and a balanced , darker - hued and very funny Shrek finale , they 've found the magic again . "
Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a " Bâˆ’ " grade , saying " Everyone involved fulfills his or her job requirements adequately .
But the magic is gone and Shrek
Forever After is no longer an ogre phenomenon to reckon with . "
Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote " It 's a fun ride .
What 's missing is the excitement of a new interpretation . "
Mary Pols of Time concluded her review with " Can an ogre jump a shark ?
I think so .
" Giving the film 1 star out of 4 , Kyle Smith of the New York Post wrote " After the frantic spurt of fairy - tale allusions and jokes in the first three Shreks , this one inches along with a few mostly pointless action scenes and the occasional mild pun . "
