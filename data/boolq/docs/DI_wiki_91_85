HISTORY Section::::History .
The original company was started in 1923 by Raymond E. DeWalt , the inventor of the radial arm saw .
The company grew quickly and was reorganized and re - incorporated in 1947 as DeWalt Inc. After buying the company in 1949 , American Machine & Foundry Co. , Inc. sold it to Black & Decker in 1960 .
Black & Decker divested itself of the radial arm saw manufacturing branch in 1989 , selling it to two executives .
Radial arm saws that use the original DeWalt design can still be obtained from the Original Saw Co.
In 1992 , Black & Decker started a major effort to rebrand its professional quality and high - end power tools to DeWalt .
Currently , DeWalt manufactures and sells more than 200 different power hand - tools and 800 accessories .
In 1994 , DeWalt took over the German wood - working power tool producer ELU .
DeWalt increased their line of tools using ELU 's technology .
DeWalt is now a popular brand of tools for commercial contractors .
In 2004 , Black and Decker bought rival power tool manufacturer Porter - Cable and combined it with DeWalt in Jackson , Tennessee .
In 2011 , DeWalt launched a line of contractors ' hand tools ( including utility knives , pliers , adjustable wrenches , tape measures , saws , and hammers ) .
In 2013 , the line was expanded to include mechanics ' tools ( wrenches , ratchets , and sockets ) .
In 2013 , DeWalt issued a press release stating it would be bringing some assembly of a small selection of their products to the US using globally manufactured parts from Brazil , China , the Czech Republic , Italy , Mexico , the UK , and the US .
The products assembled in the US would be branded under the label , " Built in the USA with global materials . "
As of 2015 , DeWalt has seven manufacturing facilities building DeWalt branded products in the US : New Britain , CT , Hampstead , MD , Shelbyville , KY , Greenfield , IN , Cheraw , SC , Charlotte , NC , and Jackson , TN .

The pack runs at either 20V ( 18V nominal ) or 60V ( 54V nominal ) depending upon whether it is placed into a 60V FlexVolt tool or one of their 20V Max tools .
The pack switches between connecting the battery cells in series ( 60V , 2Ah ) or parallel ( 20V , 6Ah ) depending upon the activated pin configuration determined by the power tool .
In May 2018 , Dewalt released a line of cordless lawn mowers that uses either their 20v or 40v batteries .
BRAND LAUNCHING Section::::Brand Launching .
Black & Decker was long associated with lighter - weight consumer tools such as household appliances , and not the heavy - duty equipment professional builders want .
In the late 1980s Michael Hammes , executive vice president and president of the company 's power tools and home improvement group , introduced the " Acura concept , " a notion Honda utilized to enter the upscale automobile market .
Black & Decker found it useful to relinquish a name with little appeal to many consumers in the market for construction tools .
DeWalt was acquired in 1960 and continued to produce radial arm saws and other large , stationary , power equipment , Black & Decker expanded the DeWalt name and used this to replace their " Construction Grade " trademark in 1992 .
In a US - wide market survey done by Black & Decker before its reintroduction , the name DeWalt was recognized by 70 percent of tradesmen .
The black and yellow DeWalt design , often associated with safety equipment and advertised on display , helped propel Black & Decker 's profits to new heights .
NASCAR SPONSORSHIP Section::::NASCAR Sponsorship .
DeWalt Tools sponsored NASCAR driver Matt Kenseth from 1999 through to the 2009 season .
In this time period , Kenseth won 18 races , the 2000 Sprint Cup Rookie of the Year Award , 2003 Sprint Cup Series Championship , 2004 Sprint Cup
All Star Race and the 2009 Daytona 500 .
However , in July 2009 , DeWalt announced that they would not be renewing their sponsorship deal with Kenseth and Roush Fenway Racing due to the poor economic conditions in the construction industry .
DeWalt had also sponsored MotoGP rider , Ben Spies , for the 2010 racing season .
DeWalt returned to NASCAR sponsorship in 2011 , but on the # 9 Richard Petty Motorsports Ford Fusion driven by Marcos Ambrose .
This sponsorship ended after 2014 , when Ambrose departed the Sprint Cup Series , with DeWalt choosing to re - unite with Kenseth , who now drives the # 20 for Joe Gibbs Racing , for six races in 2015 and 15 races in 2017 .
