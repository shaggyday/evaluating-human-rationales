PLOT Section::::Plot .
In 1993 , Jerry Shepard is a guide at an Antarctica research base under contract with the National Science Foundation .
UCLA professor , Dr. Davis McClaren , arrives at the base .
He presses Shepard to take him to Mount Melbourne to find a rare meteorite from Mercury .
Shepard decides that the only way to get to Mount Melbourne is by dog sled .
Shepard and McClaren make it to Mount Melbourne , but are called back to base camp due to an approaching heavy storm .
McClaren begs for more time , and Shepard gives him half a day , which is enough time to find a fragment of the meteorite .
En route back to base , McClaren slips down an embankment , breaking his leg and falling into freezing water .
Shepard uses the lead dog Maya to carry a rope to McClaren and pulls him out .
The two battle hypothermia , frostbite and near whiteout conditions as the dogs lead them home .
Once there , the entire human crew is immediately evacuated , while the dogs are left behind .
Certain that their pilot will return within days for the dogs , Shepard tightens their collars to ensure they can not get loose and run away .
But because of the harsh weather conditions , no rescue can be attempted until the next spring - and by then the dogs will be dead .
Back at home , Shepard tries to secure a plane to return and save the dogs , but no one is willing to finance the risky expedition .
Five months later , Shepard makes one last attempt to get back .
McClaren realizes the magnitude of his ingratitude and uses the remaining balance of his grant money to finance a rescue mission .
Shepard acknowledges that there is almost no chance that any of the dogs have survived this long , but he owes it to his team to go back for them .
After being left behind , the eight sled dogs – lead dog Maya , Old Jack , Shorty , Dewey , Truman , Shadow , Buck , and the young Max , wait in the freezing conditions for Shepard to return .
After two weeks without eating , they free themselves to forage for food , except Old Jack who remains attached to the chain .
Some time later , Dewey slips and falls down an incline , where he is fatally injured .
The team stays with him until morning , but have to leave as he has already died .
In the blizzard , Max becomes separated from the group .
Maya manages to lead the team to the Russian base , which is unsecured and full of food , while Max finds his way back to the American base , which is still locked and abandoned .
Setting back out into the wilderness , Max finds the carcass of a dead Orca , but is driven off by a leopard seal .
Maya and the team are nearby , and Max lures the seal away so the team can eat .
It doubles back and attacks Maya , who is badly injured when it claps its reptile - like maw onto her paw .
The team , now reunited , continue traveling .
They are starving , freezing and exhausted , and eventually the injured Maya collapses into the snow .
The dogs lie down beside their leader as the snow piles up around them .
They have been on their own for nearly six months .
Shepard makes it back to base with the others and is dismayed to find the body of Old Jack , still attached to the chain , and no sign of the other dogs .
He hears the sound of barking and sees Max , Shorty , Truman , Shadow and Buck come over the horizon .
After a joyous reunion , Shepard attempts to load the dogs into the snowmobile , but Max runs off , with Shepard in hot pursuit .
Max leads him to Maya , lying in the snow – weak , but alive .
With six of his eight sled dogs in tow , Shepard and his crew head back to civilization , with the last scene showing a grave for the two fallen dogs , Old Jack and Dewey .

William Arnold of the Seattle Post - Intelligencer reacted favorably ( " the dog actors will melt your heart " ) , but pointed out , as did other reviewers , that " Antarctica buffs " will be critical of errors , such as portraying midwinter events occurring in " balmy , blazing daylight at a time Antarctica is locked in round - the - clock darkness and temperatures of 140 degrees below .
