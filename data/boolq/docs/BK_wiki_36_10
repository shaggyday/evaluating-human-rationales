JAMES J.
BRADDOCK James Walter Braddock ( June 8 , 1905 – November 29 , 1974 ) was an American boxer who was the world heavyweight champion from 1935 to 1937 .
Fighting under the name James J. Braddock ( ostensibly to follow the pattern set by two prior world boxing champions , James J. Corbett and James J. Jeffries ) , Braddock was known for his spoiling , counterpunching style , powerful right hand and his iron chin .
He had lost several bouts due to chronic hand injuries and was forced to work on the docks and collect social assistance to feed his family during the Great Depression .
He made a comeback , and in 1935 he fought Max Baer for the heavyweight title and won .
For this unlikely feat he was given the nickname " Cinderella Man " by Damon Runyon .
Braddock was managed by Joe Gould .
EARLY LIFE
Section::::Early life .
Braddock was born in Hell 's Kitchen in New York City on West 48th Street .
He moved to North Bergen , New Jersey at an early age .
He was one of seven children being raised by immigrant parents ; Irish mother Elizabeth O'Tool and Anglo - Irish father Joseph Braddock .
He stated his life 's early ambition was to play college football for Knute Rockne at the University of Notre Dame , but he had " more brawn than brains . "
CAREER Section::::Career .
Braddock pursued boxing , turning pro at the age of 21 , fighting as a light heavyweight .
His first fight in a ring occurred on November 27 , 1923 .
After three years , Braddock 's record was , with 21 knockouts .
In 1928 , Braddock pulled off a major upset by knocking out highly regarded Tuffy Griffiths .
The following year he earned a chance to fight for the title , but he narrowly lost to Tommy Loughran in a 15-round decision .
Braddock was greatly depressed by the loss and badly fractured his right hand in several places in the process .
His next 33 fights were significantly less successful , with a record .
With his family in poverty during the Great Depression , Braddock had to give up boxing for a little while and worked as a longshoreman .
Due to frequent injuries to his right hand , Braddock compensated by using his left hand during his longshoreman work , and it gradually became stronger than his right .
He always remembered the humiliation of having to accept government relief money , but was inspired by the Catholic Worker Movement , a Christian social justice organization founded by Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin in 1933 to help the homeless and hungry .
After his boxing comeback , Braddock returned the welfare money he had received and made frequent donations to various Catholic Worker Houses , including feeding homeless guests with his family .
MAX BAER FIGHT Section::::Max Baer fight .
In 1934 , Braddock was given a fight with the highly touted John " Corn " Griffin .
Although Braddock was intended simply as a stepping stone in Griffin 's career , he knocked out the " Ozark Cyclone " in the third round .
Braddock then fought John Henry Lewis , a future light heavyweight champion .
He won in one of the most important fights of his career .
After defeating another highly regarded heavyweight contender , Art Lasky , whose nose he broke during the bout on March 22 , 1935 , Braddock was given a title fight against the World Heavyweight Champion , Max Baer .
Baer hardly trained for the bout , but Braddock did .
" I 'm training for a fight .
Not a boxing contest or a clownin ' contest or a dance " , he said .
" Whether it goes 1 round or 3 rounds or 10 rounds , it will be a fight and a fight all the way ...
When you 've been through what I 've had to face in the last two years , a Max Baer or a Bengal tiger looks like a house pet .
He might come at me with a cannon and a blackjack and he would still be a picnic compared to what I 've had to face . "
Considered little more than a journeyman fighter , Braddock was hand - picked by Baer 's handlers because he was seen as an easy payday for the champion , despite his recent impressive victories .
Instead , on June 13 , 1935 , at Madison Square Garden Bowl , Braddock won the Heavyweight Championship of the World as the 10-to-1 underdog in what was called " the greatest fistic upset since the defeat of John L. Sullivan by Jim Corbett " .
During the fight , a dogged Braddock took a few heavy hits from the powerful younger champion ( 30 years versus 26 years for Baer ) , but Braddock kept coming , wearing down Baer , who seemed perplexed by Braddock 's ability to take a punch .
In the end , the judges gave Braddock the title with a unanimous decision .
HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION
Section::::Heavyweight Champion .
Braddock suffered from problems with his arthritic hands after injuries throughout his career and , in 1936 , his title defense in Madison Square Garden against the German Max Schmeling was canceled under suspicious circumstances .
Braddock argued he would have received only a US$ 25,000 purse against Schmeling , compared to $ 250,000 against rising star Joe Louis .
There was also concern that if Schmeling won , the Nazi government would deny American fighters opportunities to fight for the title .
Finally , American commentators had expressed opposition to the fight in light of the connections between Schmeling and Adolf Hitler , with whom the German fighter had been associated after his earlier victory over Louis .
PERSONAL LIFE Section::::Personal life .
Braddock married Mae Fox in 1930 and the couple had three children , James ( Jay ) , Howard and Rosemarie .
Braddock enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1942 and became a first lieutenant .
He served in the Pacific theater on the island of Saipan , where he trained enlisted men in hand - to - hand combat .
Upon return , he worked as a marine equipment surplus supplier and helped construct the Verrazano Bridge in the early 1960s .
DEATH AND LEGACY Section::::Death and legacy .
After his death in 1974 at the age of 69 , James J. Braddock was interred in the Mount Carmel Cemetery in Tenafly , New Jersey .
He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2001 .
James J. Braddock North Hudson County Park in North Bergen , New Jersey is named in his honor .
The 2005 biographical film Cinderella Man tells Braddock 's story .
Directed by Ron Howard , it stars Russell Crowe as Braddock and Renée Zellweger as his wife , Mae .
The film had an estimated budget of $ 88 million and grossed $ 108.5 million worldwide .
Crowe 's performance earned him a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor .
Paul Giamatti , playing Braddock 's manager Joe Gould , was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor .
The role of neighbor Sara Wilson was played by Rosemarie DeWitt , who is Braddock 's real - life granddaughter ( daughter of Braddock 's daughter Rosemarie Braddock and husband Kenny DeWitt ) .
The film received mostly positive reviews .
