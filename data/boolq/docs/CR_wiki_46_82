EARLY LIFE
Section::::Early life .
Thompson was born in Nassau , Bahamas , but moved to the United States as a youth , settling in Miami , Florida
and he attended Miami Jackson Senior High School .
In his senior year in 1974 as part of a basketball starting lineup nicknamed the " Jackson 5 " featuring himself , three other Bahamians and a Cuban , the Generals mowed through the regular season beating opponents by an average of 30 points per game en route to a 33 - 0 record and winning the Class 4A state championship over Winter Park High School .
The title was won with four key ineligible players ( due to falsified birth records ) , including Thompson , on Miami Jackson 's team .
He then attended the University of Minnesota where he had a standout collegiate career .
NBA CAREER Section::::NBA career .
The Portland Trail Blazers made 6'10 "
( 208 cm )
Thompson the number one pick in the 1978 NBA draft , the first foreign - born player to be selected first .
Thompson was a fixture in the Portland lineup for eight years ( though one season was missed due to injury ) , where he started at both power forward and center positions .
He was named to the 1979 All - Rookie team , and had arguably his statistically best season in 1981–82 , where he averaged over 20 points and 11 rebounds per game .
In the 1986 off - season , Thompson was traded to the Spurs in exchange for center / forward Steve Johnson .
Thompson played only half a season with the Spurs , before he was traded again , this time to Los Angeles for center / forward Frank Brickowski , center Pétur Guðmundsson and a 1990 first - round draft choice .
He was brought to the Lakers in February 1987 to back up Kareem Abdul - Jabbar and defend Boston Celtics forward Kevin McHale .
This gave the Pat Riley coached Lakers a team that had four players who were overall # 1 selections in the NBA draft , the others being Abdul - Jabbar ( 1969 ) , Magic Johnson ( 1979 ) , and James Worthy ( 1982 ) .
Of those four , Thompson is the only one not enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame or to have his number ( 43 ) retired by the Lakers .
Although he rarely started for the Lakers ( during the 1987–88 season he played in 104 of the 106 Lakers games , all from the bench ) , Thompson proved more than a capable back up at center for the aging Abdul - Jabbar ( and later Vlade Divac ) and power forward for A. C. Green .
Thompson won consecutive titles with the Lakers in 1987 and 1988 and reached the Finals in 1989 .
Mychal Thompson retired in 1991 .
As of 2018 , Mychal and his son Klay , are the fourth father - son duo to have each won an NBA Championship as a player ; the others were ( in chronological order of completing the feat ) ,
Matt Guokas , Sr . and his son Matt Guokas , Jr. , Hall of Famer Rick Barry and his son Brent Barry , and Hall of Famer Bill Walton and his son Luke Walton .
The Thompsons , along with the Waltons , are also the only father - son tandems to have each won two championships each , with the Thompsons being the only tandem to win in two consecutive years .
