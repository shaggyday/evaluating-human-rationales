Section::::Concept .
Four years prior to the introduction of the production Jeep Compass , a concept vehicle with the same name had its world premiere in Detroit at the 2002 North American International Auto Show .
It featured a two - door body , all - wheel drive and a 3.7-liter V6 engine .
The 3.7 L Power - Tech V6 engine from the Jeep Liberty did not make it into the all - new Compass for 2007 , though the production model Compass kept the concept car 's styling cues and some of its features .
