HISTORY Section::::History .
Trader Joe 's is named after its founder , Joe Coulombe .
The chain began in 1958 as a Greater Los Angeles area chain of Pronto Market convenience stores .
The original Pronto Markets were so similar to 7-Eleven that Coulombe felt the competition with 7-Eleven would be disastrous .
Coulombe is said to have developed the idea of the Trader Joe 's South Seas motif while on vacation in the Caribbean .
The Tiki culture fad of the 1950s and 1960s was fresh in the cultural memory , and Trader Vic 's was at its height with 25 locations worldwide .
He had noticed that Americans were traveling more and returning home with tastes for food and wine they had trouble satisfying in supermarkets of the time .
The first store branded as " Trader Joe 's " opened in 1967 .
This store , on Arroyo Parkway in Pasadena , California , remains in operation to this day .
In the first few decades since opening , some of the stores offered fresh meats provided by butchers who leased space in the stores .
Trader Joe 's at one time had sandwich shops , freshly cut cheese and freshly squeezed orange juice all in - store .
Germany 's Theo Albrecht ( owner and CEO of Aldi Nord ) bought the company in 1979 as a personal investment for his family .
Coulombe was succeeded as CEO by John Shields in 1987 .
Under his leadership the company expanded beyond California , moving into Arizona in 1993 and into the Pacific Northwest two years later .
In 1996 , the company opened its first stores on the East Coast in Brookline and Cambridge , both just outside Boston .
Shields retired from his position in 2001 .
Dan Bane succeeded him as CEO after working as President of the Western Division .
When Bane became CEO in 2001 , there were 156 stores in 15 states .
BusinessWeek reported that Trader Joe 's quintupled the number of its stores between 1990 and 2001 , and multiplied its profits by ten .
Supermarket News estimated Trader Joe 's sales for 2015 at $ 13 billion , and placed Trader Joe 's 21st on the list of " SN 's Top 75 Retailers for 2016 . "
In February 2008 , BusinessWeek reported that the company had the highest sales per square foot of any grocer in the United States .
Two - and - a - half years later and in 2016 , Fortune magazine estimated sales to be $ 1,750 in merchandise per square foot â€” more than double the sales generated by Whole Foods .
In February 2016 , due to customer feedback , Trader Joe 's announced their goal " to have all the eggs they sell in western states ( CA , OR , WA , AZ , NM and CO ) come from cage - free suppliers by 2020 and all the eggs we sell nationally to come from cage - free suppliers by 2025 . "
