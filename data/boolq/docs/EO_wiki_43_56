SIKORSKY S-61R
The Sikorsky S-61R is a twin - engine helicopter used in transport or search and rescue roles .
A developed version of the S-61 / SH-3 Sea King , the S-61R was also built under license by Agusta as the AS-61R.
The S-61R served in the United States Air Force as the CH-3C / E Sea King and the HH-3E Jolly Green Giant , and with the United States Coast Guard as the HH-3F " Pelican " .
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Development .
The Sikorsky S-61R was developed as a derivative of their S-61 / SH-3 Sea King model .
It features a substantially revised fuselage with a rear loading ramp , a conventional though watertight hull instead of the S-61 's boat - hull , and retractable tricycle landing gear .
The fuselage layout was used by Sikorsky for the larger CH-53 variants , and by the much later ( though similarly - sized ) S-92 .
Sikorsky designed and built an S-61R prototype as a private venture with its first flight in 1963 .
During its development , the US Air Force placed an order for the aircraft , which was designated CH-3C.
The Air Force used the CH-3C to recover downed pilots .
The CH-3E variant with more powerful engines would follow in 1965 .
The improved HH-3E variant would follow later , with eight built , and all 50 CH-3Es were converted to this standard .
Known as the Jolly Green Giant , the HH-3E featured protective armor , self - sealing tanks , a retractable inflight refueling probe , jettisonable external tanks , a high - speed hoist , and other specialized equipment .
In 1965 , the U.S. Coast Guard ordered a version designated HH-3F Sea King ( more commonly known by its nickname " Pelican " ) for all - weather air - sea rescue .
The Pelican featured search radar with a nose antenna radome offset to port , and water landing capability .
Italian Agusta built a S-61R variant , named AS-61R under license .
Agusta produced 22 helicopters for the Italian Air Force .
The company claimed it could re - open the production line in 36 months to build additional AS-61 helicopters .
OPERATIONAL SERVICE
UNITED STATES Section::::Operational service .
Section::::United States .
USAF variants served in numerous air rescue squadrons and aerospace rescue and recovery squadrons of the Military Airlift Command ( MAC ) , rescue squadrons of the Air Combat Command ( ACC ) and other USAF major commands worldwide .
The aircraft was also used by a number of Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard rescue squadrons .
All USAF HH-3Es , to include Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard , were retired in the 1990s and replaced by the current HH-60 G Pavehawk .
The HH-3F Pelican was a dependable workhorse for the US Coast Guard from the late 1960s until it was phased out in the late 1990s .
All USCG HH-3Fs were replaced by the HH-60J Jayhawk and those aircraft have since been upgraded to the MH-60 T Jayhawk version .
TRANSATLANTIC FLIGHT Section::::Transatlantic flight .
Between 31 May and 1 June 1967 , two HH-3Es of the United States Air Force made the first nonstop flight across the Atlantic Ocean by helicopter .
Departing from New York in the early hours , the two helicopters arrived at the 1967 Paris Air Show at Le Bourget after a 30 hr 46 min flight .
The operation needed nine in - flight refuelings .
Both helicopters were later lost in combat operations in Southeast Asia in 1969 and 1970 .
HONORS AND AWARDS Section::::Honors and awards .
Due to the nature of combat operations , particularly in Southeast Asia , many of the operational H-3 crews received honors and awards .
The highest American military award , the Medal of Honor , was awarded to Captain Gerald Young , USAF , on 9 November 1967 .
Young piloted an HH-3E , AF Ser .
No . 66 - 13279 , of the 37th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron in an attempt to rescue a US Army Special Forces reconnaissance team trapped by enemy fire in Laos .
When his aircraft was shot down , he escaped the burning wreckage and , despite severe wounds , evaded capture for 17 hours until being rescued .
Six men were aboard 66 - 13279 when it went down just after midnight on the morning of 09
Nov : four aircrew from the 37th ARRS ( Young , Capt Ralph W. Brower , SSgt Eugene L. Clay , and Sgt Larry W. Maysey ) and two wounded recon team members from Command & Control Central , MACV SOG ( MSG Bruce R. Baxter and SGT Joseph G. Kusick ) .
Late on 09 Nov Captain Young was recovered and a four - man recovery team inserted into the crash site , but darkness precluded a detailed search of the wreckage .
On the morning of 10 Nov , three charred remains ( two crewmen and Kusick ) were removed from the wreckage and placed with MSG Baxter 's remains about 40 meters from the wreckage ( Baxter had been thrown clear ) to permit recovery by a single hoist .
However , a combination of weather and renewed enemy action forced the recovery team to leave the crash site without the recovered remains ; although the recovery team was picked up safely , the four remains could not be retrieved .
The remains of the third aircrewman were not found .
ITALY Section::::Italy .
Italian Agusta began production in 1974 and delivered 22 helicopters as replacements for the Grumman HU-16 Albatross used for SAR ( Search and Rescue ) missions at sea .
Italian Air Force AS-61R helicopters performed SAR missions under designation HH-3F in time of peace and C / SAR ( Combat SAR ) in time of crisis or during military assignment .
All helicopters were operated by the five flights of the 15 ° Stormo Stefano Cagna and deployed in four bases across Italy .
From 1993 15
° Stormo performed support missions to evacuate civilians during natural catastrophes and disasters in Italy .
15º Stormo was also engaged with SAR missions in the hostile zones of the several operations abroad where Italian Armed Forces were deployed - Somalia , Albania , Bosnia , Kosovo , Iraq and Afghanistan .
The Italian Air Force phased out the HH-3F on 26 September 2014 , replacing them with the AgustaWestland AW139 in the SAR role VARIANTS
