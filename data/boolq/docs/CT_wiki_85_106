NBA DRESS CODE
On October 17 , 2005 , National Basketball Association commissioner David Stern announced the implementation of a mandatory dress code for all NBA and NBA Development League players .
This was especially noteworthy because the NBA became the first major professional sports league to implement such a rule , although National Hockey League rules state that a player is supposed to wear a jacket and tie to games and on charters if not told otherwise by the head coach or general manager .
The dress code went into effect at the start of the 2005–06 NBA season .
DETAILS OF THE DRESS CODE Section::::Details of the dress code .
Stern 's dress code stated that all players must dress in business or conservative attire while arriving and departing during a scheduled game , on the bench while injured , and when conducting official NBA business ( press interviews , charity events , etc . ) .
The new dress code banned fashions most often associated with hip - hop culture , specifically : jerseys , jeans , hats , do - rags , T - shirts , large jewelry , sneakers and caulk boots .
This particular clothing is not allowed to be worn by players to interviews , games ( on and off the bench ) , charity events , or any other occasion affiliated with the NBA or the NBDL ( now the G League ) .
Violators of the dress code are fined and may be suspended with repeat offenses .
The dress code was developed with the intention of combating image problems that have plagued the NBA in recent history .
Under current NBA dress regulations , if a player does not dress to participate in a game , he must dress in a manner suitable for a coach .
In the NBA , a suit or a sport coat is required for coaches , as well as a necktie .
SUPPORTING ARGUMENTS
Section::::Supporting arguments .
The league 's image was in bad shape following the Pacers – Pistons brawl in 2004 .
Supporters also claim that most businesses require their employees to adhere to a dress code of some kind so the NBA is not making any unusual demands .
Moreover , the NBA was not requiring players to wear a suit and tie , as had been rumored initially .
Further , many NBA teams already had dress codes , as dictated by coaches or general managers .
Penalties for non - compliance usually involved fines such as having to pay for one 's own airfare to wherever the team was going , rather than flying on the team charter .
OPPOSING ARGUMENTS
Section::::Opposing arguments .
Critics such as Allen Iverson , Stephen Jackson and Paul Pierce claim that the dress code will not change a person 's character regardless of what type of clothing they wear , and that associating hip - hop style of dress with crime or a bad image is racist .
Iverson was also quoted to say , " the dress code is not who I am and does n't allow me to express myself . "
Many NBA and non - NBA sports figures also claim that it targets young black males and is a slap against hip - hop culture .
Most NBA players are sponsored by companies such as Nike , Adidas , Puma and Converse .
IMPACT

Writing for Rolling Stone , Zack Graham said that although players were initially critical of the dress code , " Over the years , NBA players accepted , then embraced and eventually began to have fun with the new dress code , changing men 's fashion in the process . "
