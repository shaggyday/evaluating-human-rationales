TIE - DYE Tie - dye is a modern term invented in the mid-1960s in the United States ( but recorded in writing in an earlier form in 1941 as " tied - and - dyed " , and 1909 as " tied and dyed " by Charles E. Pellew , referenced below ) for a set of ancient resist - dyeing techniques , and for the products of these processes .
The process of tie - dye typically consists of folding , twisting , pleating , or crumpling fabric or a garment and binding with string or rubber bands , followed by application of dye(s ) .
The manipulations of the fabric prior to application of dye are called resists , as they partially or completely prevent the applied dye from coloring the fabric .
More sophisticated tie - dyes involve additional steps , including an initial application of dye prior to the resist , multiple sequential dye and resist steps , and the use of other types of resists ( stitching , stencils ) and discharge .
Unlike regular resist - dyeing techniques , tie - dye is characterized by the use of bright , saturated primary colors and bold patterns .
These patterns , including the spiral , mandala , and peace sign , and the use of multiple bold colors , have become cliched since the peak popularity of tie - dye in the 1960s and 1970s .
The vast majority of currently produced tie - dyes use these designs , and many are mass - produced for wholesale distribution .
However , a new interest in more ' sophisticated ' tie - dye is emerging in the fashion industry , characterized by simple motifs , monochromatic color schemes , and a focus on fashionable garments and fabrics other than cotton .
A few artists continue to pursue tie - dye as an art form rather than a commodity .
DYES , FABRICS , AND DISCHARGE AGENTS Section::::Dyes , fabrics , and discharge agents .
A variety of dyes are used in tie - dyeing , including household , fiber reactive , acid , and vat dyes .
Most early ( 1960s ) tie - dyes were made with retail household dyes , particularly those made by Rit .
In order to be effective on different fibers , these dyes are composed of several different dyes , and thus are less effective , and more likely to bleed and fade , than pure dyes designed for specific fibers .
This is the basis for the famous ' pink socks ' phenomenon that occurs when fabrics dyed with mixed dyes are washed with other garments .
Most tie - dyes are now dyed with Procion MX fiber reactive dyes , a class of dyes effective on cellulose fibers such as cotton , hemp , rayon , and linen .
This class of dyes reacts with fibers at alkaline ( high ) pH , forming a wash - fast , permanent bond .
Soda ash ( sodium carbonate ) is the most common agent used to raise the pH and initiate the reaction , and is either added directly to the dye , or in a solution of water in which garments are soaked before dyeing .
Procion dyes are relatively safe and simple to use , and are the same dyes used commercially to color cellulosic fabrics .
Protein - based fibers such as silk , wool , and feathers , as well as the synthetic polyamide fiber , nylon , can be dyed with acid dyes .
As may be expected from the name , acid dyes are effective at acidic ( low ) pH , where they form ionic bonds with the fiber .
Acid dyes are also relatively safe ( some are used as food dyes ) and simple to use .
Vat dyes , including indigo , are a third class of dyes that are effective on cellulosic fibers and silk .
Vat dyes are insoluble in water in their unreduced form , and the vat dye must be chemically reduced before they can be used to color fabric .
This is accomplished by heating the dye in a strongly basic solution of sodium hydroxide ( lye ) or sodium carbonate ( caustic potash ) containing a reducing agent such as sodium hydrosulfite or thiourea dioxide .
The fabric is immersed in the dye bath , and after removal the vat dye oxidizes to its insoluble form , binding with high wash - fastness to the fiber .
However , vat dyes , and especially indigo , must be treated after dyeing by ' soaping ' to prevent the dye from rubbing ( crocking ) off .
Vat dyes can be used to simultaneously dye the fabric and to remove underlying fiber - reactive dye ( i.e. , can dye a black cotton fabric yellow ) because of the bleaching action of the reducing bath ( see below ) .
The extra complexity and safety issues ( particularly when using strong bases such as lye ) restrict use of vat dyes in tie - dye to experts .
Discharge agents are used to bleach color from the previously - dyed fabrics , and can be used as a reverse tie - dye , where application of the agent results in loss of color rather than its application .
Household bleach ( sodium hypochlorite ) can be used to discharge fiber reactive dyes on bleach - resistant fibers such as cotton or hemp ( but not on wool or silk ) , though the results are variable , as some fiber reactive dyes are more resistant to bleach than others .
It is important to bleach as long as required to obtain the desired shade ( which will be lighter than observed on wet , unwashed fabric ) , and to neutralize the bleach with agents such as sodium bisulfite , to prevent damage to the fibers .
Thiourea dioxide is another commonly used discharge agent that can be used on cotton , wool , or silk .
A thiourea dioxide discharge bath is made with hot water made mildly basic with sodium carbonate .
The results of thiourea dioxide discharge differ significantly from bleach discharge due to the nature of the reaction .
Since thiourea dioxide only bleaches in the absence of oxygen , and the fabric to be bleached retains oxygen , a fractal pattern of bleaching will be observed .
This is in distinct contrast with household bleach discharge , where the bleaching agent penetrates fabric easily ( particularly in bleach formulations containing detergent ) .
For example , pleating fabric multiple times and clamping on a resist will yield a clear design after outlining the resist with household bleach , but discharge with reducing agents will only partially penetrate the resisted area .
In general , discharge techniques , particularly using household bleach , are a readily accessible way to tie - dye without use of often messy and relatively expensive dyes .
It is particularly easy to put design on cloth using stencils and sprayed - on solutions of household bleach , but the intricate and unintended results of discharge using reducing agents often surpasses the results of oxidizing discharge techniques .
DESIGNS AND PATTERNS Section::::Designs and patterns .
Tie - dye can be used to create a wide variety of designs on fabric , from standard patterns such as the spiral , peace sign , diamond , and the marble effect to beautiful works of art .
Using techniques such as stencils ( a la screen printing using dyes or discharge pastes ) , clamped - on shaped blocks , and tritik ( stitching and gathering ) , tie - dye can produce almost any design desired .
If a modern kit is used , then it is easier to accomplish a spiral or circle .
HISTORY EARLIEST EXAMPLES Section::::History .
Section::::Earliest examples .
The earliest surviving examples of pre - Columbian tie - dye in Peru date from 500 to 810 AD .
Their designs include small circles and lines , with bright colors including red , yellow , blue , and green .
ASIA Section::::Asia .
Shibori
a form of tie - dye which originated in Japan and Indonesia .
It has been practiced there since the 8th century .
Shibori includes a number of labor - intensive resist techniques which include stitching elaborate patterns and tightly gathering the stitching before dyeing , forming intricate designs for kimonos .
Another shibori method is to wrap the fabric around a core of rope , wood or other material , and bind it tightly with string or thread .
The areas of the fabric that are against the core or under the binding would remain undyed .
In the 1941 book " Orphans of the Pacific " , about Philippines , it was noted : " There are a few thousand Bagobos , who wear highly decorated clothing made of hemp fiber , all tied - and - dyed into fancy designs , and who further ornament themselves with big metal disks . "
Plangi and tritik are Indonesian words , derived from Japanese words , for methods related to tie - dye , and ' bandhna ' a term from India , giving rise to the Bandhani fabrics of Rajasthan .
Ikat is a method of tie - dyeing the warp or weft before the cloth is woven .
Mudmee tie - dye originates in Thailand and neighboring part of Laos .
It uses different shapes and colors from other types of tie - dye , and the colors are , in general , more subdued .
Another difference is that the base color is black .
AFRICA Section::::Africa .
Tie - dye techniques have also been used for centuries in the Hausa region of West Africa , with renowned indigo dye pits located in and around Kano , Nigeria .
The tie - dyed clothing is then richly embroidered in traditional patterns .
It has been suggested that these African techniques were the inspiration for the tie - dyed garments identified with hippie fashion .
TIE - DYE IN THE WESTERN WORLD Section::::Tie - dye in the Western world .
Tie - dyeing was known in the US by 1909 , when Professor Charles E. Pellow of Columbia University acquired some samples of tie - dyed muslin and subsequently gave a lecture and live demonstration of the technique .
Although shibori and batik techniques were used occasionally in Western fashion before the 1960s , modern psychedelic tie - dying did not become a fad until the late 1960s following the example set by rock stars such as Janis Joplin and John Sebastian ( who did his own dyeing ) .
The 2011 film documentary Magic Trip , which shows amateur film footage taken during the 1964 cross - country bus journey of countercultural icon Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters , shows the travelers developing a form of tie - dye by taking LSD beside a pond and pouring enamel - based model airplane paint into it , before placing a white T - shirt upon the surface of the water .
Although the process is closer to paper marbling , in the accompanying narrative , the travelers claim credit for inventing tie - dyeing .
Tie - dying , particularly after the introduction of affordable Rit dyes , became popular as a cheap and accessible way to customize inexpensive T - shirts , singlets , dresses , jeans , army surplus clothing , and other garments into psychedelic creations .
Some of the leading names in tie - dye at this time were Water Baby Dye Works ( run by Ann Thomas and Maureen Mubeem ) , Bert Bliss , and Up Tied , the latter winning a Coty Award for " major creativity in fabrics " in 1970 .
Up Tied created tie - dyed velvets and silk chiffons which were used for exclusive one - of - a - kind garments by Halston , Donald Brooks , and Gayle Kirkpatrick , whilst another tie - dyer , Smooth Tooth Inc. dyed garments for Dior and Jonathan Logan .
In late 1960s London , Gordon Deighton created tie - dyed shirts and trousers for young fashionable men which he sold through the Simpsons of Piccadilly department store in London .
