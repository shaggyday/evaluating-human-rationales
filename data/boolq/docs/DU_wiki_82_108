The film was the seventh - highest grossing film of 2007 , earning $ 256 million domestically and $ 329 million internationally , for a total of $ 585 million .
PLOT Section::::Plot .
In 2009 , a genetically re - engineered measles virus , originally created as a cure for cancer , turns into a lethal strain which kills 90 % of those it infects , mutates over 9 % into predatory , nocturnal and vampiric mutants , called Darkseekers , who are extremely vulnerable to sunlight , with less than 1 % immune .
Three years after the outbreak , US Army virologist Lieutenant Colonel Robert Neville ( Will Smith ) lives an isolated life in the deserted ruins of New York City , unsure if any other uninfected humans are left in the world .
Neville 's daily routine includes experimentation on infected rats to find a cure to the virus and venturing through Manhattan to search for food and supplies , as well as waiting each day for any human survivors who have responded to his continuous recorded radio broadcasts , which instruct any uninfected people to meet him at midday at the South Street Seaport .
Flashbacks reveal that his wife ( Salli Richardson ) and daughter ( Willow Smith ) died in a helicopter accident during the chaotic evacuation of Manhattan , prior to the military - enforced quarantine of the island in 2009 , when Neville stayed behind on the island as military personnel .
Neville 's only mitigation for his loneliness is his German Shepherd named Samantha , a.k.a . Sam ( given to him by his daughter as a puppy to protect him before she died in the helicopter crash ) , interaction with mannequins he has set up as patrons at a video store , and recordings of old television broadcasts .
At night , he barricades himself and Sam inside his heavily fortified Washington Square Park home to hide from the Darkseekers .
One day , while waiting for survivors , Sam follows a deer into a dark building .
Neville cautiously goes in after her and finds the deer 's corpse along with Sam , but the building is infested by a colony of Darkseekers .
Both manage to escape unharmed and the attacking Darkseekers are killed by the sunlight .
Neville finds a promising treatment derived from his own blood , so he sets a snare trap and captures a female Darkseeker from the colony building , while a male Darkseeker ( termed " Alpha Male " in the script , and played by Dash Mihok ) tries to go after them , but is blocked by the sunlight and returns to the shadows .
Back in his laboratory in the basement of his house , Neville treats the female without success .
The next day , he is ensnared in a trap similar to the one he used to capture the female ; by the time he manages to escape , the sun is setting and he is attacked by infected dogs .
Neville and Sam manage to eliminate them , but Sam is bitten in the fight .
Neville injects her with a strand of his serum , but when she shows signs of infection , Neville is forced to strangle her to death .
Heartbroken and driven over the edge of insanity by his dog 's death , he ventures out and suicidally attacks a group of Darkseekers the next night .
He kills a large number of Darkseekers but the rest overwhelm him and he is nearly killed , but is rescued by a pair of immune survivors , Anna ( Alice Braga ) and a young boy named Ethan ( Charlie Tahan ) , who have traveled from Maryland after hearing one of his broadcasts .
They take the injured Neville back to his home , where Anna explains that they survived the outbreak aboard a Red Cross evacuation ship from SÃ£o Paulo and are making their way to a survivors ' camp in Bethel , Vermont .
Neville angrily argues that no such survivors ' camp exists .
Neville once again attempts to administer a potential cure to the infected woman in his laboratory , but the next night , a group of Darkseekers , who had followed Anna and Neville back the night before , attacks the house .
Neville , Anna , and Ethan retreat into the basement laboratory , sealing themselves in with the female Darkseeker on which Neville has been experimenting .
Discovering that the last treatment was successful , Neville tries to assess the situation as the alpha male deliberately rams himself against a glass door to break in .
Neville draws a vial of blood from the woman he cured and gives it to Anna , before shutting her and Ethan inside a coal chute in the back of the lab .
He then takes a grenade and kills the Darkseekers at the cost of his own life , saving the cure .
The next day , before dusk , Anna and Ethan discover that her theory is right as they arrive at the survivors camp in Vermont .
They are greeted by military officers and other human survivors before Anna is shown handing the cure to military personnel .
DIRECTOR 'S CUT ENDING
Section::::Director 's Cut ending .
During the lab attack , the alpha male makes a butterfly - shaped smear on the glass .
Neville realizes that the alpha male is identifying the female which he was experimenting on by her butterfly tattoo and that it wants her back .
Neville puts his gun down and returns the female .
Neville and the alpha male stare each other down as the former apologizes to the latter .
The alpha male accepts it and the Darkseekers leave .
Shocked , Neville looks over the pictures of his numerous test subjects and the implications of his research methods begin to dawn on him .
Neville , Anna , and Ethan then drive to the survivors ' camp in Vermont with the antidote .

The science - fiction horror genre reemerged in the late 1990s .
In 1995 , Warner Bros. began developing the film project , having owned the rights to Richard Matheson 's 1954 novel I Am Legend since 1970 and having already made the 1971 adaptation The Omega Man .
Mark Protosevich was hired to write the script after the studio was impressed with his spec script of The Cell .
Protosevich 's first draft took place in 2000 in San Francisco , and contained many similarities with the finished film , though the Darkseekers ( called ' Hemocytes ' ) were civilized to the point of the creatures in The Omega Man and Anna was a lone morphine addict , as well as the fact that a Hemocyte character named Christopher joined forces with Neville .
Warner Bros. immediately put the film on the fast track , attaching Neal H. Moritz as producer .
Actors Tom Cruise , Michael Douglas , and Mel Gibson had been considered to star in the film , using a script by Protosevich and with Ridley Scott as director ; however , by June 1997 , the studio 's preference was for actor Arnold Schwarzenegger .
In July , Scott and Schwarzenegger finalized negotiations , with production slated to begin the coming September , using Houston as a stand - in for the film 's setting of Los Angeles .
Scott had Protosevich replaced by a screenwriter of his own choosing , John Logan , with whom he spent months of intensive work on a number of different drafts .
The Scott / Logan version of I Am Legend was a mix of sci - fi and psychological thriller , without dialogue in the first hour and with a sombre ending .
The creatures in Logan 's version were similar to the Darkseekers of the finished film in their animalistic , barbaric nature .
The studio , fearing its lack of commercial appeal and merchandising potential , began to worry about the liberties they had given Scott â then on a negative streak of box office disappointments â and urged the production team to reconsider the lack of action in the screenplay .
After an " esoteric " draft by writer Neal Jimenez , Warner Bros. reassigned Protosevich to the project , reluctantly working with Scott again .
In December 1997 , the project was called into question when the projected budget escalated to $ 108 million due to media and shareholder scrutiny of the studio in financing a big - budget film .
Scott rewrote the script in an attempt to reduce the film 's budget by $ 20 million , but in March 1998 , the studio canceled the project due to continued budgetary concerns , and quite possibly to the box office disappointment of Scott 's last three films , , White Squall , and G.I. Jane .
Likewise , Schwarzenegger 's recent films at the time ( Eraser and Warner Bros. own Batman & Robin ) also underperformed , and the studio 's latest experiences with big budget sci - fi movies Sphere and The Postman were negative , as well .
In August 1998 , director Rob Bowman was attached to the project , with Protosevich hired to write a third all - new draft , far more action - oriented than his previous versions , but the director ( who reportedly wished for Nicolas Cage to play the lead ) moved on to direct Reign of Fire and the project did not get off the ground .
In March 2002 , Schwarzenegger became the producer of I Am Legend , commencing negotiations with Michael Bay to direct and Will Smith to star in the film .
Bay and Smith were attracted to the project based on a redraft that would reduce its budget .
However , the project was shelved due to
Warner Bros. president Alan F. Horn 's dislike of the script .
In 2004 , Akiva Goldsman was asked by head of production Jeff Robinov to produce the film .
In September 2005 , director Francis Lawrence signed on to helm the project , with production slated to begin in 2006 .
Guillermo del Toro was originally approached to direct by Smith , but turned it down to direct .
Lawrence , whose film Constantine was produced by Goldsman , was fascinated by empty urban environments .
He said , " Something 's always really excited me about that ...
to have experienced that much loss , to be without people or any kind of social interaction for that long . "
Goldsman took on the project as he admired the second I Am Legend film adaptation , The Omega Man .
A rewrite was done to distance the project from the other zombie films inspired by the novel , as well as from the recently released 28 Days Later , although Goldsman was inspired by the scenes of a deserted London in the British horror film to create the scenes of a deserted New York City .
A 40-page scene - by - scene outline of the film was developed by May 2006 .
When delays occurred on Smith 's film Hancock , which was scheduled for 2007 , it was proposed to switch the actor 's films .
This meant filming would have to begin in 16 weeks : production was given a green light , using Goldsman 's script and the outline .
Elements from Protosevich 's script were introduced , while the crew consulted with experts on infectious diseases and solitary confinement .
Rewrites continued throughout filming , because of Smith 's improvisational skills and Lawrence 's preference to keep various scenes silent .
The director had watched Jane Campion 's film
The Piano with a low volume so as to not disturb his newborn son , and realized that silence could be very effective cinema .
CASTING
Section::::Casting .
Will Smith signed on to play Robert Neville in April 2006 .
He said he took on
I Am Legend because he felt it could be like " Gladiator [ or ] Forrest Gump â these are movies with wonderful , audience - pleasing elements , but also uncompromised artistic value .
[ This ] always felt like it had those possibilities to me .
"
The actor found Neville to be his toughest acting challenge since portraying Muhammad Ali in Ali ( 2001 ) .
He said that " when you 're on your own , it is kind of hard to find conflict .
" The film 's dark tone and exploration of whether Neville has gone insane during his isolation meant Smith had to restrain himself from falling into a humorous routine during takes .
To prepare for his role , Smith visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Georgia .
He also met with a person who had been in solitary confinement and a former prisoner of war .
Smith compared Neville to Job , who lost his children , livelihood , and health .
Like the Book of Job , I Am Legend studies the questions , " Can he find a reason to continue ?
Can he find the hope or desire to excel and advance in life ?
Or does the death of everything around him create imminent death for himself ? "
He also cited an influence in Tom Hanks ' performance in Cast Away ( 2000 ) .
Abbey and Kona , both three - year - old German Shepherd dogs , played Neville 's dog Sam .
The rest of the supporting cast consists of Salli Richardson as Zoe , Robert 's wife , and Alice Braga as a survivor named Anna .
Willow Smith , Will Smith 's daughter , makes her film debut as Marley , Neville 's daughter .
Emma Thompson has an uncredited role as Dr. Alice Krippin , who appears on television explaining her vaccine for cancer that mutates into the virus .
Singer Mike Patton provided the guttural screams of the infected " hemocytes " , and Dash Mihok provided the character animation for the infected " alpha male " .
Several filler characters with uncredited roles were in old news broadcasts and flashbacks , such as the unnamed President 's voice ( Pat Fraley ) , and the cast of The Today Show .
FILMING
Section::::Filming .
Akiva Goldsman decided to move the story from Los Angeles to New York City to take advantage of locations that would more easily show emptiness .
Goldsman explained , " L.A. looks empty at three o'clock in the afternoon , [ but ] New York is never empty . . .
it was a much more interesting way of showing the windswept emptiness of the world . "
Warner Bros. initially rejected this idea because of the logistics , but Francis Lawrence was determined to shoot on location , to give the film a natural feel that would benefit from not shooting on soundstages .
Lawrence went to the city with a camcorder , and filmed areas filled with crowds .
Then , a special effects test was conducted to remove all those people .
The test had a powerful effect on studio executives .
Michael Tadross convinced authorities to close busy areas such as the Grand Central Terminal viaduct , several blocks of Fifth Avenue , and Washington Square Park .
The film was shot primarily in the anamorphic format , with flashback scenes shot in Super 35 .
Filming began on September 23 , 2006 .
The Marcy Avenue Armory in Williamsburg was used for the interior of Neville 's home , while Greenwich Village was used for the exterior .
Other locations include the Tribeca section of lower Manhattan , the aircraft carrier Intrepid , the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx , and St. Patrick 's Cathedral .
Weeds were imported from Florida and were strewn across locations to make the city look like it had been overgrown with them .
The closure of major streets was controversial with New Yorkers .
Will Smith said , " I do n't think anyone 's going to be able to do that in New York again anytime soon .
People were not happy .
That 's the most middle fingers I 've ever gotten in my career . "
A bridge scene was filmed for six consecutive nights in January on the Brooklyn Bridge to serve as a flashback scene in which New York 's citizens evacuate the city .
Shooting the scene consumed $ 5 million of the film 's reported $ 150 million budget , which was likely the most expensive shoot in the city to date .
The scene , which had to meet requirements from 14 government agencies , involved 250 crew members and 1,000 extras , including 160 National Guard members .
Also present were several Humvees , three Strykers , a cutter , a utility boat , and two response boat small craft , as well as other vehicles including taxis , police cars , fire trucks , and ambulances .
Filming concluded on March 31 , 2007 .
Computer - generated imagery ( CGI ) was used to depict the main spans of the Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan Bridge collapsing as missiles from passing military jets blew them up to quarantine Manhattan island .
Reshoots were conducted around November 2007 .
Lawrence noted , " We were n't seeing fully rendered shots until about a month ago .
The movie starts to take on a whole other life .
It 's not until later that you can judge a movie as a whole and go , ' Huh , maybe we should shoot this little piece in the middle , or tweak this a little bit . '
It just so happened that our re - shoots revolved around the end of the movie . "
EFFECTS Section::::Effects .
A week into filming , Francis felt the infected ( referred to as " Darkseekers " or " hemocytes " in the script ) , who were being portrayed by actors wearing prosthetics , were not convincing .
His decision to use CGI resulted in an increased budget and extended post - production , although the end results were not always well received .
The concept behind the infected was that their adrenal glands were open all of the time and Lawrence explained , " They needed to have an abandon in their performance that you just ca n't get out of people in the middle of the night when they 're barefoot .
And their metabolisms are really spiked , so they 're constantly hyperventilating , which you ca n't really get actors to do for a long time or they pass out . "
The actors remained on set to provide motion capture .
" The film 's producers and sound people wanted the creatures in the movie to sound somewhat human , but not the standard " , so Mike Patton , lead singer of Faith No More , was engaged to provide the screams and howls of the infected .
In addition , CGI was used for the lions and deer in the film , and to erase pedestrians in shots of New York .
Workers visible in windows , spectators , and moving cars in the distance were all removed .
In his vision of an empty New York , Lawrence cited John Ford as his influence : " We did n't want to make an apocalyptic movie where the landscape felt apocalyptic .
A lot of the movie takes place on a beautiful day .
There 's something magical about the empty city as opposed to dark and scary that was the ideal that the cast and crew wanted . "

Section::::Critical response .
On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes the film had an approval rating of 69 % based on 211 reviews , with an average rating of 6.8/10 .
The site 's critical consensus reads , " I Am Legend overcomes questionable special effects and succeeds largely on the strength of Will Smith 's mesmerizing performance .
"
On Metacritic , which assigns a rating to reviews , the film has an average score of 65 out of 100 , based on 37 critics , indicating " generally favorable reviews " .
A. O. Scott wrote that Will Smith gave a " graceful and effortless performance " and also noted the " third - act collapse " .
He felt that the movie " does ponder some pretty deep questions about the collapse and persistence of human civilization " .
Dana Stevens of Slate wrote that the movie lost its way around the hour mark , noting that " the Infected just are n't that scary .
"
NPR critic Bob Mondello noted the film 's subtext concerning global terrorism and that this aspect made the film fit in perfectly with other , more direct cinematic explorations of the subject .
Richard Roeper gave the film a positive review on the television program At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper , commending Will Smith as being in " prime form " , also saying there are " some amazing sequences " and that there was " a pretty heavy screenplay for an action film .
" The film has been criticized for diverging from Matheson 's novel , especially in its portrayal of a specifically Christian theme .
Much of the negative criticism concerned the film 's third act , with some critics favoring the alternative ending in the DVD release .
Doug Walker said the alternate ending was " powerful , thought provoking , and challenging " , and the theatrical ending was " a betrayal " and " castration " of both the film 's tone and of what made the original story so impactful .
Popular Mechanics published an article on December 14 , 2007 , addressing some of the scientific issues raised by the film : * the rate of deterioration of urban structures , infrastructure , and survival of fauna and flora
*
* the plausibility of a retrovirus spreading out of control as depicted in the film ( The measles virus depicted in the film , however , is not a retrovirus , but is in fact a part of the Paramyxovirus family . )
* * the mechanics of the Brooklyn Bridge 's destruction * The magazine solicited reactions from Alan Weisman , author of The World Without Us , virologist W. Ian Lipkin , MD , and Michel Bruneau , PhD , comparing their predictions with the film 's depictions .
The article raised the most questions regarding the virus ' mutation and the medical results , and pointed out that a suspension bridge like the Brooklyn Bridge would likely completely collapse rather than losing only its middle span .
Neville 's method of producing power using gasoline - powered generators seemed the most credible : " This part of the tale is possible , if not entirely likely , " Popular Mechanics editor Roy Berendsohn says .
Philosopher Slavoj Zizek criticized the film politically as being the most regressive adaptation from the novel .
He said that while the original novel had a progressive multicultural message where Neville became a " legend " to the new creatures and is subsequently killed by them ( much like vampires were legends to humans ) , the 2007 film finds a cure for the Darkseekers and it is delivered by a survivor through apparent divine intervention .
According to Zizek , this misses the original message and " openly opt[s ] for religious fundamentalism . "
ACCOLADES Section::::Accolades .
I Am Legend earned four nominations for the Visual Effects Society awards , and was also nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble at the Screen Actors Guild Awards , Outstanding Film and Actor at the Image Awards , and Best Sound at the Satellite Awards .
In June 2008 , Will Smith won a Saturn Award for Best Actor .
Will Smith also won the MTV Movie Awards for Best Male Performance .
FUTURE Section::::Future .
Director Francis Lawrence said in 2008 that there would be a prequel and that Will Smith would be reprising his role .
The plot of the film would reveal what happened to Neville before the infected took over New York .
D. B. Weiss was hired to write the script , while Lawrence was in negotiations to return as director on the contingent that the story was interesting enough .
Smith later discussed the premise , which would have his character and a team going from New York City to Washington , D.C. , as they made their last stand against those infected with the virus .
The film would again explore the premise of what it is like to be alone .
Lawrence stated , " ...
the tough thing is , how do we do that again and in a different way ? "
In May 2011 , Francis Lawrence stated that the prequel was no longer in development saying , " I do n't think that 's ever going to happen . "
In 2012 , Warner Bros. announced that negotiations had been made to produce another installment , with the intention of having Will Smith reprise his role .
In April 2014 , the studio attained a script entitled A Garden at the End of the World , described as a post - apocalyptic variation of The Searchers .
Studio executives found so many similarities to I Am Legend in the screenplay , they had the writer Gary Graham rewrite it so it could serve as the next film .
Serving as a reboot of the story , the studio hopes to create a franchise of films .
Will Smith , who is known for his reluctance to appear in sequels , has not commented on whether he will appear or not .
