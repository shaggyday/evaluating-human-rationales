CRITICAL RESPONSE
Section::::Critical response .
The opening show in Cardiff received positive reviews .
Mark Sutherland from Rolling Stone gave the opening show in Cardiff a positive review .
He called it a sort of reaffirmation of dominance for the pair as they deliver a " a hits - packed , visually stunning show " .
Writing for The Guardian , Rachel Aroesti awarded the concert four out of five stars and noted that the concept of the show revolved around the singers showing the " deathless nature of their love rather than its perfection " .
Beyoncé was critiqued after some of her " biggest hits " were left out of the set list on the opening night , including " Halo " and " Single Ladies ( Put a Ring on It ) " .
However , with over 60 songs rehearsed for the tour , the set list was believed to change between shows .
Bonginkosi Tshabalala of No Name publications added that the show at Houston proved that " no matter what happens LOVE wins " .
