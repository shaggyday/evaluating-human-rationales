AMAZON REDSHIFT Amazon Redshift is an Internet hosting service and data warehouse product which forms part of the larger cloud - computing platform Amazon Web Services .
It is built on top of technology from the massive parallel processing ( MPP ) data warehouse company ParAccel ( later acquired by Actian ) , to handle large scale data sets and database migrations .
Redshift differs from Amazon 's other hosted database offering , Amazon RDS , in its ability to handle analytic workloads on big data data sets stored by a column - oriented DBMS principle .
Amazon Redshift is based on an older version of PostgreSQL 8.0.2 , and Redshift has made changes to that version .
An initial preview beta was released in November 2012 and a full release was made available on February 15 , 2013 .
The service can handle connections from most other applications using ODBC and JDBC connections .
