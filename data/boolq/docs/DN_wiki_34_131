BOWL ( SMOKING )
A bowl , when referred to in pipe smoking , is the part of a smoking pipe or bong that is used to hold tobacco , cannabis , or other substances .
The exterior surface of the bowl of some pipes may be fashioned with some kind of design .
The character Henry Flower , in James Joyce 's Ulysses carries a tobacco pipe with the bowl carved into a head : "
He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacob 's pipe , its clay bowl fashioned as a female head . "
Thomas Curtis ' London Encyclopaedia of 1839 describes a " fumigator " , an instrument found in a doctor 's surgery " for injecting tobacco smoke into the anus of drowned persons , with a view to excite the irritability of the muscles " .
Curtis describes the best as being made by a W. Willurgby " the bowl of which is of cast brass and is large enough to contain about an ounce and a half of tobacco " .
Scholarly interest in the history of the evolution of the bowl of the clay tobacco pipe , extends as far back as 1863 .
In the 1860s antiquaries attempted to date clay pipe bowls by their evolving shapes and sizes .
The bowls of ceremonial pipes used by some indigenous American nations are often carved from red pipestone or catlinite , a fine - grained easily worked stone of a rich red color of the Coteau des Prairies , west of the Big Stone Lake in South Dakota .
The pipestone quarries have traditionally been neutral ground among warring tribes , as people from multiple nations journeyed to the quarry to obtain the sacred pipestone .
Sacred ceremonial pipes are not used for smoking intoxicants , but rather to offer prayers in a spiritual or religious ceremony .
