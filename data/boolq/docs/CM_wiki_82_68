CUBE STEAK Cube steak is a cut of beef , usually top round or top sirloin , tenderized and flattened by pounding with a meat tenderizer , or by using an electric tenderizer .
The name refers to the shape of the indentations left by that process ( called " cubing " ) .
This is the most common cut of meat used for the American dish chicken fried steak .
MINUTE STEAK Section::::Minute steak .
In Ireland , Canada , Australia , and some parts of the United States , cube steak may be called a minute steak , because it can be cooked quickly .
Minute steak may also be distinguished by : * simply referring to the cut , which is not necessarily tenderized ; * thinner than cube steak ( hence does not need tenderizing ) ;
* taking at least one minute to cut one piece ;
* cut from sirloin or round , while cube steak cut is from chuck or round .
The term minute steak is also used in the United Kingdom , where the term cube steak is little known .
