COMPANIES ACT 2006
The Companies Act 2006 ( c 46 ) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which forms the primary source of UK company law .
It had the distinction of being the longest Act in British Parliamentary history : with 1,300 sections and covering nearly 700 pages , and containing 16 schedules ( the list of contents is 59 pages long )
but it has since been surpassed , in that respect , by the Corporation Tax Act 2009 .
The Act was brought into force in stages , with the final provision being commenced on 1 October 2009 .
It superseded the Companies Act 1985 .
The Act provides a comprehensive code of company law for the United Kingdom , and made changes to almost every facet of the law in relation to companies .
The key provisions are : *
the Act codifies certain existing common law principles , such as those relating to directors ' duties .
*
it implements the European Union 's Takeover and Transparency Obligations Directives .
* it introduces various new provisions for private and public companies .
*
it applies a single company law regime across the United Kingdom , replacing the two separate ( if identical ) systems for Great Britain and Northern Ireland .
*
it otherwise amends or restates almost all of the Companies Act 1985 to varying degrees .
The Bill for the Act was first introduced to Parliament as " the Company Law Reform Bill " and was intended to make wide - ranging amendments to existing statutes .
Lobbying from directors and the legal profession ensured that the Bill was changed into a consolidating Act , avoiding the need for cross - referencing between numerous statutes .
The reception of the Act by the legal professions in the United Kingdom has been lukewarm .
Concerns have been expressed that too much detail has been inserted to seek to cover every eventuality .
Whereas a complete overhaul of company law was promised , the Act seems to leave much of the existing structure in place , and to simplify certain aspects only at the margins .
In other areas , it is said to have complicated and obfuscated previously settled law and may make doing business more difficult for those operating small companies .
IMPLEMENTATION Section::::Implementation .
A small portion of the Act came into effect on Royal Assent in November 2006 .
The first and second Commencement Orders then brought further provisions into force in January 2007 and April 2007 .
The implementation timetable for the remainder of the Act was announced in February 2007 , by Margaret Hodge , Minister for Industry and the Regions .
The third and fourth Commencement Orders brought a further tranche of provisions into force in October 2007 , and the fifth , sixth and seventh in April and October 2008 .
The eighth commencement order , made in November 2008 , brought the remainder of the Act into force with effect from October 2009 .
The staggered timetable was intended to give companies sufficient time to prepare for the new regime under the Act , rather than implementing all 1,300 sections of the Act on one day .
Another reason for the staggered implementation is that , despite the Act 's size , a great many sections provide for subsidiary legislation to be brought in by Secretary of State , which has taken time to draft .
Implementation of the Act is the responsibility of the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills .
DIRECTORS Section::::Directors .
The Act replaced and codified the principal common law and equitable duties of directors , but it does not purport to provide an exhaustive statement of their duties , and so it is likely that the common law duties survive in a reduced form .
Traditional common law notions of corporate benefit have been swept away , and the new emphasis is on corporate social responsibility .
The seven codified duties are as follows :
* S171 to act within their powers - to abide by the terms of the company 's memorandum and articles of association and decisions made by the shareholders ; * * S172 to promote the success of the company - directors must continue to act in a way that benefits the shareholders as a whole , but there is now an additional list of non - exhaustive factors to which the directors must have regard .
This was one of the most controversial aspects of the new legislation at the drafting stage .
These factors are : *
* the long term consequences of decisions * * the interests of employees
*
* the need to foster the company 's business relationships with suppliers , customers and others
* * the impact on the community and the environment * * the desire to maintain a reputation for high standards of business conduct
*
* the need to act fairly as between members
*
* S173 to exercise independent judgment - directors must not fetter their discretion to act , other than pursuant to an agreement entered into by the company or in a way authorised by the company 's articles
* * S174 to exercise reasonable care , skill and diligence - this must be exercised to the standard expected of * * someone with the general knowledge , skill and experience reasonably expected of a person carrying out the functions of the director ( the objective test ) and also * * the actual knowledge , skill and experience of that particular director ( the subjective test ) * * S175 to avoid conflicts of interest - methods for authorising such conflicts by either board or shareholder approval are also to be introduced *
* S176 not to accept benefits from third parties *
* S177 to declare an interest in a proposed transaction with the company - there are to be carve outs for matters that are not likely to give rise to a conflict of interest , or of which the directors are already aware .
There will be an additional statutory obligations to declare interests in relation to existing transactions .
* Although the changes to directors ' duties were the most widely publicised ( and controversial ) feature of the legislation , the Act also affects directors in various other ways :
* S239 The shareholders ' ability to ratify any conduct of a director ( including breach of duty , negligence , default or breach of trust ) is regulated by the statute , although S 239.7 leaves the door open for common law principles , previously the only guide on this .
Under the Act , directors who are also shareholders , or persons connected to them , are not entitled to vote in relation to any ratification resolution concerning their actions .
* Existing restrictions on companies indemnifying directors against certain liabilities were relaxed to permit indemnities by group companies to directors of corporate trustees and occupational pension schemes .
* SS261 - 3
The Act gave shareholders a statutory right to pursue claims against the directors for misfeasance on behalf of a company ( a derivative action ) , although the shareholders need the consent of the court to proceed with such a claim .
* Certain transactions between the company and its directors which were previously prohibited by law have become lawful subject to the approval of shareholders ( for example , loans from the company to its directors )
*
The Act requires at least one director on the board of the company to be a natural person , although corporate directors are still permitted .
* The current age restriction of 70 for directors of public companies has been abolished .
A new minimum age of 16 has been introduced for all directors who are natural persons ( S157 ) .
* Directors will have the option of providing Companies House with a service address , which will in future enable their home addresses to be kept on a separate register to which access will be restricted .
GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section::::General provisions .
The Act contains various provisions which affect all companies irrespective of their status :
* Company formation - the procedure for incorporating companies will be modernised to facilitate incorporation over the Internet .
It will become possible for a single person to form a public company .
* Constitutional documents - a company 's articles of association will become its main constitutional document , and the company 's memorandum will be treated as part of its articles .
New model articles for private companies to be made under the Act are intended to reflect better the way that small companies operate , and will replace the existing Table A. Existing companies will be permitted to adopt the new model articles in whole or in part .
* Corporate capacity - under the new Act a company 's capacity will be unlimited unless its articles specifically provide otherwise , thus greatly reducing the applicability of the ultra vires doctrine to corporate law and removing the need for an excessively long objects clause in the Memorandum of Association .
* Execution of documents - Formalities for execution as a deed are to be further revised , so that a single director can execute a document as a deed on behalf of the company by a simple signature in the presence of a witness .
* Share capital - the requirement for an authorised share capital will be abolished .
Companies will be able to redenominate their share capital from one currency to another without an order of the court .
* Distributions in kind - The Act addresses the current uncertainty in the law in relation to the transfer of non - cash assets by a company to a shareholder , and whether this should be treated as a distribution .
* Shareholder meetings -
The Act enables shareholder meetings to be held more quickly .
Special resolutions now require only 14 days ' notice unless proposed at an AGM .
*
Shareholder communications -
The Act made it easier for companies to communicate electronically ( e.g. by email or by website ) with their shareholders by express agreement ( which agreement can be obtained under the articles , or by the shareholder failing to indicate that they do not wish to communicate via the website , as well as by more conventional methods ) .
* Auditor 's liability - auditors are now permitted to limit their liability for claims in negligence , breach of trust or breach of duty so long as : * the shareholders have approved the limitation in advance .
* the court considers the limitation of liability to be ' fair and reasonable '
This change was made after intensive lobbying by the accounting profession in the United Kingdom .
* Company Names Adjudicator - Section 69 of the Act provides for the appointment of a Company Names Adjudicator .
A Company Names Tribunal was established on 1 October 2008 through which the Company Names Adjudicator will administer his powers via the UK Intellectual Property Office under the tribunal .
Section 69 has expanded the grounds under which any person can object to a conflicting company name registration under the Act .
PRIVATE COMPANIES Section::::Private companies .
One of the more touted aspects of the new legislation was the simplification of the corporate regime for small privately held companies .
A number of the changes brought about by the Act apply only to private companies .
Significant changes include : * Company secretaries - a private company no longer needs to appoint a company secretary , but may do so if it wishes .
* Shareholders ' written resolutions - the requirement for unanimity in shareholders ' written resolutions was abolished , and the required majority is similar to that for shareholder meetings - a simple majority of the eligible shares for ordinary resolutions , or 75 % for special resolutions .
* Abolition of AGMs - private companies are no longer required to hold Annual General Meetings , although they can elect to provide for them in their articles if they wish .
* Short notice of meetings - private companies can convene meetings at short notice where consent is given by holders of 90 % by nominal value of shares carrying the right to vote .
* Allotment of shares - where private companies have only one class of shares , the directors will have unlimited authority to allot shares unless the articles otherwise provide .
* Financial assistance - the Act abolishes the prohibition on private companies providing financial assistance for the purchase of their own shares , and the related " whitewash " exemption procedure , though public companies remain subject to financial assistance restrictions .
* Reduction of share capital - private companies will be able to reduce their share capital without the need to obtain a court order .
* Filing of accounts - the period in which accounts must be filed has been reduced from 10 months to 9 months from the financial year end .
PUBLIC AND LISTED COMPANIES Section::::Public and listed companies .
The Act also seeks to promote greater shareholder involvement , and a number of new requirements are introduced for public companies , some of the provisions of which only apply to companies whose shares are listed on the main board of the London Stock Exchange ( but , importantly , not to companies whose shares are listed on AIM ) .
* Business review - the Act imposes additional requirements for companies listed on the main board of the LSE in their annual report and accounts .
These now include : * main trends and factors likely to affect future development , performance and position of the business ; *
* information on environmental matters , employees and social issues ; and * * information on contractual and other arrangements essential to the company 's business .
*
* AGM and accounts - main list companies will be required to hold their AGM and file accounts within 6 months of the end of the financial year .
They will also be required to :
* publish their annual report and accounts on their website ;
* * disclose results of polled votes at general meetings on their website ; *
* give certain minority shareholders the right to require independent scrutiny of any polled vote , the results of which must be published on the company 's website .
*
* Political donations and expenditure - the Act contains simplification and clarification of the existing provisions requiring shareholder approval for political donations and expenditure , and clarifies a number of grey areas ( such as expenditure relating to trade unions ) .
* Enfranchising indirect investors - nominee shareholders of main list companies will be able to nominate persons on behalf of whom they hold shares to receive copies of company communications and annual reports and accounts .
All companies will also be able to include provisions in their articles to identify some other party to exercise additional rights of the shareholder .
This is to address the concern that shares in publicly listed companies are frequently held in an intermediary 's name , which makes it more difficult for the beneficial owners of the shares to exercise their rights as shareholder .
* Voting by institutions - the Act empowers the government to introduce regulations in the future that would require institutions to disclose how they have voted .
The government has indicated it will only introduce such regulations after full consultation and if a voluntary disclosure scheme does not work .
* Paperless share transfers - the Act gives the government power to make regulations requiring ( as well as permitting ) paper - free holding and transferring of shares in main list companies .
* Transparency Obligations Directive - the Act brings into force the European Directive imposing obligations on main list companies in relation to financial reporting , disclosure of major acquisitions or disposals of its shares and the dissemination of information about the company to its shareholders and the public generally .
The Act gives the Financial Services Authority power to make rules to implement the requirements of the Directive , which would be implemented by way of changes to the existing Listing Rules and Disclosure Rules .
The Act also introduces a statutory compensation scheme for misleading or inaccurate statements in reports .
* Takeovers - the EU Takeover Directive was implemented by interim regulations in the United Kingdom in May 2006 .
The Act extends the statutory basis for the regulations in relation to certain matters , such as the statutory footing of the Takeover Panel , and the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers .
It also extended the " minority sweep up " provisions which were introduced by an amendment to the Companies Act 1985 , and addresses certain practical problems which had arisen in relation to their operation .
