AUSTRALIA – UNITED STATES RELATIONS Australia
– United States relations are the international relations between the Commonwealth of Australia and the United States of America .
At the governmental level , Australia – United States relations are formalised by the ANZUS treaty and the Australia – United States Free Trade Agreement .
According to a 2014 BBC World Service poll , 44 percent of Australians had a " mainly positive " view of the United States and 46 percent had a " mainly negative " view , for a net rating of −2 points .
No similar survey was conducted to ascertain American perceptions of Australia .
According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report , 55 % of Australians approve of U.S. leadership , with 21 % disapproving and 24 % uncertain .
In a more recent 2016 Pew Research poll , 60 % of Australians approve of U.S. leadership .
In 2017 , a major poll conducted in Australia by the Lowy Institute showed that 77 % believed an alliance with the US was important for security .
However , the survey showed that 60 % of Australians had developed an unfavorable view of the US as a result of President Donald Trump .
The survey also showed that the US was no longer considered Australia 's " best friend " , a title now held by New Zealand .
A 2017 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center showed only 29 % of Australians had confidence in current US leader President Donald Trump , in contrast to the 87 % who had confidence in former US president , Barack Obama .
It also showed 70 % of Australians had no confidence in the current US president .
The annual Lowy Institute survey revealed that in 2018 only 55 % of Australians believed that the US could act responsibly in the world .
This was a drop from 83 % in 2011 and a record low .
The survey also revealed that 70 % of Australians do n't think that Donald Trump could act responsibly with only 30 % believing he could do so .

77,399 2,927,754 INDEPENDENT FOREIGN POLICY
Section::::Independent foreign policy .
The political and economic changes wrought by the Great Depression and Second World War , and the adoption of the Statute of Westminster 1931 , necessitated the establishment and expansion of Australian representation overseas , independent of the British Foreign & Commonwealth Office .
Australia established its first overseas missions ( outside London ) in January 1940 .
The first accredited diplomat sent by Australia to any foreign country was B. G. Casey , appointed to Washington in January 1940 .
The U.S. Embassy opened in Canberra in 1943 , constructed in a Georgian architectural style .
MILITARY Section::::Military .
In 1908 , Prime Minister Alfred Deakin invited the Great White Fleet to visit Australia during its circumnavigation of the world .
The fleet stopped in Sydney , Melbourne and Albany .
Deakin , a strong advocate for an independent Australian Navy , used the visit to raise the public 's enthusiasm about a new navy .
The visit was significant in that it marked the first occasion that a non - Royal Navy fleet had visited Australian waters .
Many saw the visit of the Great White Fleet as a major turning point in the creation of the Royal Australian Navy .
Shortly after the visit , Australia ordered its first modern warships , a purchase that angered the British Admiralty .
During World War II , U.S. General Douglas MacArthur was appointed Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the South West Pacific Area , which included many Australian troops .
MacArthur 's headquarters were located in Brisbane until 1944 and Australian forces remained under MacArthur 's overall command until the end of World War II .
After the Guadalcanal Campaign , the 1st Marine Division was stationed in Melbourne , and Waltzing Matilda became the division 's march .
ANZUS Section::::ANZUS . After the war , the American presence in the southwest Pacific increased immensely , most notably in Japan and the Philippines .
In view of the cooperation between the Allies during the war , the decreasing reliance of Australia and New Zealand on the United Kingdom , and America 's desire to cement this post - war order in the Pacific , the ANZUS Treaty was signed by Australia , New Zealand and the United States in 1951 .
This full three - way military alliance replaced the ANZAC Pact that had been in place between Australia and New Zealand since 1944 .
Australia , along with New Zealand , has been involved in most major American military endeavors since World War II including the Korean War , Vietnam War , Gulf War and the Iraq War — all without invocation of ANZUS .
The alliance has only been invoked once , for the invasion of Afghanistan after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon .
WAR ON TERROR Section::::War on Terror .
Following the September 11 attacks , in which eleven Australian citizens were also killed , there was an enormous outpouring of sympathy from Australia for the United States .
Prime Minister John Howard became one of President George W. Bush 's strongest international supporters , and supported the United States in the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and the invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
In 2004 the Bush Administration " fast tracked " a free trade agreement with Australia .
The Sydney Morning Herald called the deal a " reward " for Australia 's contribution of troops to the Iraq invasion .
However , Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd indicated that the 550 Australian combat troops in Iraq would be removed by mid-2008 .
Despite this , there have been suggestions from the Australian government that might lead to an increase in numbers of Australian troops in Afghanistan to roughly 1,000 .
In 2011 , during US President Obama 's trip to Australia , it was announced that United States Marine Corps and United States Air Force units will be rotated through Australian Defence Force bases in northern Australia to conduct training .
This deployment was criticised by an editorial in the Chinese state - run newspaper People 's Daily and Indonesia 's foreign minister , but welcomed by Australia 's Prime Minister .
A poll by the independent Lowy Institute think tank showed that a majority ( 55 % ) of Australians approving of the marine deployment and 59 % supporting the overall military alliance between the two countries .
In 2013 , the US Air Force announced rotational deployments of fighter and tanker aircraft through Australia .
POLITICAL Section::::Political .
Since 1985 , there have been annual ministerial consultations between the two countries , known as AUSMIN .
The venue of the meeting alternates between the two countries .

KYOTO PROTOCOL Section::::Kyoto Protocol .
Australia 's Prime Minister , Kevin Rudd , ratified the Kyoto Protocol on 3 December 2007 , leaving the United States and Canada as the last major industrial nations not to ratify the agreement .
Australia 's previous government , led by Liberal John Howard , refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol citing , along with the United States , that it would " damage their economies " .
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION Section::::Trump administration .
During the first phone conversation between American President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull , that took place in February 2017 and lasted around 25 minutes , Trump disagreed with Turnbull on a deal made during President Barack Obama 's presidency .
The agreement aims to take about 1,250 asylum seekers into the United States , who are currently located on Nauru and Manus Island by Australian authorities .
The deal will involve a swap of the 1,250 refugees located on Nauru and Manus with several thousand refugees originating in Honduras , Guatemala , and other Central American nations .
Though the details of the trade were not made transparent to the public , a public briefing announced the deal would be applied only to existing refugees and that they would be resettled in America in the coming year .
On Twitter , February 2 , 2017 , Trump tweeted that the refugee agreement was a " dumb deal " .
Notwithstanding the disagreement , Vice President Mike Pence , while on a visit to Australia in April 2017 , stated the United States will abide by the deal .
In August 2017 , the Washington Post released the full transcript of the meeting .
In it , President Trump described the refugee deal as " ridiculous " , " rotten " , and " stupid " .
The President , angered by the discussion about refugees , said " I have had it .
I have been making these calls all day
and this is the most unpleasant call all day .
Putin was a pleasant call " .
In a video released by Channel Nine on 14 June 2017 , Turnbull is seen mocking Trump at the Midwinter Ball .
In response to the growing threat of North Korea developing nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles , Prime Minister Turnbull , in August 2017 , emphasized the alliance between Australia and the United States and his nation 's commitment to aiding the United States with possible conflict stating , " So be very , very clear on that .
If there 's an attack on the US , the ANZUS Treaty would be invoked and Australia would come to the aid of the United States , as America would come to our aid if we were attacked . "
In May 2018 , the United States granted Australia a permanent exemption from the United States ' worldwide 25 % steel tariff , making Australia one of only four nations worldwide to be exempted .
Several other countries generally considered to have close relationships with the United States , such as Canada , Mexico , and the European Union , have not received permanent exemptions .
TRADE Section::::Trade .
Trade between the United States and Australia is strong , as evidenced by the Australia – United States Free Trade Agreement .
The United States is Australia 's fourth largest export market and its second largest source of imports .
The United States is also the largest investor in Australia while Australia is the fifth largest investor in the US .
Australia and the United States also provide significant competition for each other in several third - party exports such as wheat , uranium and wool and , more recently , in the information technology sector .
Although the US has a sizable sheep population , American imports of lamb meat from Australia and New Zealand remain stronger than the domestic output .
