PLOT Section::::Plot .
Author Gordie Lachance reads in the newspaper that his childhood friend Chris Chambers has been killed .
Gordie then narrates an extended flashback , later revealed to be a story he is writing .
The flashback tells the story of a childhood incident when he , Chambers , and two buddies journeyed to find the body of a missing boy near the town of Castle Rock , Oregon .
Twelve - year - old Gordie 's parents , grieving the recent death of Gordie 's older brother Denny , neglect Gordie .
Gordie 's friends are Chambers , who hails from a bad family ; Teddy Duchamp , whose violent father once burned his ear on a hot stove ; and Vern Tessio .
While looking for a jar of money that he buried underneath his parents ' porch , Vern overhears a conversation between his older brother Billy and Charlie Hogan .
Billy and Charlie say that recently , after having stolen a car , they saw the body of a missing boy named Ray Brower outside of town .
When Vern relates this information to Gordie , Chris , and Teddy , the four boys -- hoping to become local heroes -- decide to look for Ray 's body .
After Chris steals his father 's pistol , he and Gordie run into local hoodlum Ace Merrill and Chris 's older brother , Eyeball .
Ace threatens Chris with a lit cigarette and steals Gordie 's Yankees cap , which had been a gift from his brother .
The four boys begin their journey to find the body .
After the boys are caught trespassing by junkman Milo Pressman and his dog , Chopper , they jump a fence to escape .
An angry Pressman calls Teddy 's father a " loony " ; Teddy , enraged , tries to attack Pressman , but the other boys restrain him .
While the boys are crossing over a railroad bridge , a train approaches .
Chris and Teddy make it to the other side safely .
Just before the train catches up to Gordie and Vern , Gordie saves Vern by pulling him off of the bridge .
They both survive with no serious injuries .
At nighttime , Gordie tells the fictional story of Davie " Lard - Ass " Hogan , an obese boy who is constantly teased .
Lard - Ass enters a pie - eating contest to take revenge on his tormentors .
After eating several pies , Lard - Ass deliberately vomits , inducing mass vomiting among contestants and the audience .
Gordie describes the episode as a " barf - o - rama " .
Later that night , Chris tells Gordie that he hates being associated with his family and its bad reputation .
Chris admits that he stole milk money that he had been accused of stealing at school .
However , after feeling guilty , Chris confessed and returned the money ; despite his confession , he was suspended from school .
Chris breaks down and cries , stating that he wishes he could go somewhere where no one knows him .
Traveling through the woods , the boys swim across a pond and discover that it is filled with leeches .
Gordie briefly faints after finding a leech in his underwear .
After more hiking , the boys locate the body of Ray Brower .
The discovery is traumatic for Gordie , who asks Chris why his brother Denny had to die .
Gordie adds that his father hates him and that he is no good .
Chris tells Gordie that his father does not hate him , but does not really know him .
Ace and his gang arrive , announce that they are claiming the body , and threaten to beat the four boys if they interfere .
When Chris curses at Ace and refuses to back down , Ace draws a switchblade to kill him .
Gordie comes to Chris 's aid by firing a shot into the air with Chris 's father 's gun and threatening to shoot Ace .
Ace demands that Gordie give him the gun , but Gordie refuses , calling Ace a " cheap dime - store hood " .
Ace and his gang depart , vowing revenge .
The boys agree to report the body via an anonymous phone call .
They hike back to Castle Rock and bid each other farewell until junior high school begins , and the extended flashback ends .
The present - day Gordie writes that Chris later went to college and became a lawyer ; while attempting to break up a fight in a restaurant , he was stabbed to death .
Gordie ends his story with the following words : " ' I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was 12 .
Jesus , does anyone ? ' "

Section::::Production .
Bruce A. Evans sent a copy of Stephen King 's novella The Body to Karen Gideon , the wife of his friend and writing partner Raynold Gideon on August 29 , 1983 as a gift for her birthday .
Both Gideon and Evans quickly became fans of the novella and shortly thereafter contacted King 's agent , Kirby McCauley , seeking to negotiate film rights ; McCauley replied that King 's terms were $ 100,000 and 10 % of the gross profits .
Although the money was not an issue , the share of gross profits was considered excessive , especially considering that no stars could be featured to help sell the movie .
In response , Evans and Gideon pursued an established director , Adrian Lyne , to help sell the project .
After reading the novella , Lyne teamed up with Evans and Gideon , but all the studios the trio approached turned the project down except for Martin Shafer at Embassy Pictures .
Embassy spent four months negotiating the rights with McCauley , settling on $ 50,000 and a smaller share of the profits , and Evans and Gideon spent eight weeks writing the screenplay .
Evans and Gideon asked to also produce the film , but Shafer suggested they team up with Andy Scheinman , a more experienced producer .
Embassy was unwilling to meet Lyne 's salary for directing the film until Evans and Gideon agreed to give up half of their share of profits to meet Lyne 's asking price .
Rob Reiner later recalled that Lyne was going to direct the film , but had promised himself a vacation following the production of 9Â½ Weeks , and would not be available to start production until the spring of 1986 .
Reiner was better known at the time for playing Michael Stivic in All in the Family and had just starting a directing career , making comedies like This Is Spinal Tap and The Sure Thing .
He was sent the script by Scheinman , and his initial reaction was the script had promise but
" no focus " .
After Lyne withdrew from the project , Reiner signed on to direct in September 1984 .
In a 2011 interview , Reiner discussed his realization that the film should focus on the character of Gordie :
" In the book it was about four boys , but ...
once I made Gordie the central focus of the piece then it made sense to me : this movie was all about a kid who did n't feel good about himself and whose father did n't love him .
And through the experience of going to find the dead body and his friendship with these boys , he began to feel empowered and went on to become a very successful writer .
He basically became Stephen King . "
Reiner has said that he identified with Gordie , as he himself struggled with the shadow of fame cast by his comedian father , Carl Reiner .
The writers incorporated Reiner 's suggestions , producing a new script by December 1984 for Embassy 's review and approval .
Days before shooting started in the summer of 1985 , Embassy was sold to Columbia Pictures , who made plans to cancel the production .
Norman Lear , one of the co - owners of Embassy , gave $ 7.5 million of his own money to complete the film , citing his faith in Reiner and the script .
However , since Embassy also would have distributed the film , once the film was completed it had no distributor .
The producers showed a print to Michael Ovitz , head of the powerful Creative Artists Agency , and Ovitz promised to help them find a distributor .
Paramount , Universal Pictures , and Warner Bros. all passed on the film ; Columbia Pictures production head Guy McElwaine screened the film at his house because he was feeling ill , and the positive reaction of his daughters convinced him to distribute the film .
CASTING
Section::::Casting .
In a 2011 interview with NPR , Wil Wheaton attributed the film 's success to the director 's casting choices :
Feldman recalled how his home life translated into his onscreen character : "
[ Most kids are n't ] thinking they 're going to get hit by their parents because they 're not doing well enough in school , which will prevent them from getting a work permit , which will prevent them from being an actor .
"
O'Connell agreed that he was cast based on how his personality fit the role , saying " Rob really wanted us to understand our characters .
He interviewed our characters .
[ ... ] I tried to stay like Vern and say the stupid things Vern would .
I think I was Vern that summer .
" Reiner and the producers interviewed more than 70 boys for the four main roles , out of more than 300 who auditioned ; Phoenix originally read for the part of Gordie Lachance .
Rather than start shooting right away , Reiner put the four main actors together for two weeks to play games from Viola Spolin 's Improvisation for the Theater ( which Reiner called " the bible " of theater games ) and build camaraderie , which led to a real friendship between them and several one - shot takes , where the young actors hit their cues perfectly .
Wheaton would recall " When you saw the four of us being comrades , that was real life , not acting . " Before settling on Richard Dreyfuss as the narrator ( and the role of the adult Gordie ) , Reiner considered David Dukes , Ted Bessell , and Michael McKean . LOCATIONS Section::::Locations .
Parts of the film were shot in Brownsville , Oregon , which stood in for the fictional town of Castle Rock .
The town was selected for its small - town 1950s ambience .
Approximately 100 local residents were employed as extras .
The " barf - o - rama " scene was also filmed in Brownsville .
A local bakery supplied the pies and extra filling , which was mixed with large - curd cottage cheese to simulate the vomit .
The quantity of simulated vomit varied per person , from as much as during the triggering event to little as .
The scene where the boys outrace a steam train engine across an 80-foot tall trestle was filmed on the McCloud River Railroad , above Lake Britton Reservoir near McArthur - Burney Falls Memorial State Park in California .
The scene took a full week to shoot , making use of four small adult female stunt doubles with closely cropped hair who were made up to look like the film 's protagonists .
Plywood planks were laid across the trestles to provide a safer surface on which the stunt doubles could run .
The locomotive used for the scene , M.C.R.R. 25 , is still in daily operation for excursion service on the Oregon Coast Scenic Railroad .
Telephoto compression was used to make the train appear much closer than it actually was .
The actors did not feel a sense of danger until Reiner threatened them as follows : " You see those guys ?
They do n't want to push that dolly down the track any more .
And the reason they 're getting tired is because of you ...
I told them if they were n't worried that the train was going to kill them , then they should worry that I was going to .
And that 's when they ran . "
