LIMITED SYMPTOM ATTACK
A limited symptom attack ( LSA ) , also referred to as a limited symptom panic attack ( LPA ) , is a milder , less comprehensive form of panic attack , with fewer than four panic related symptoms being experienced ( APA 1994 ) .
For example , a sudden episode of intense dizziness or trembling accompanied by fear that something terrible is about to happen .
Many people with panic disorder have a mixture of full blown and limited symptom attacks .
LSAs often manifest in anxiety disorders , phobias , panic disorder and agoraphobia .
However , experiencing an LSA is not necessarily indicative of mental illness .
Often persons recovering from or being treated for panic attacks and panic disorder will experience LSAs .
