Time zone HISTORY Section::::History .
Before 1891 , each town and city in Metropolitan France had its own time based on local solar time .
In 1891 , to avoid complications with railway timetables , time was unified in Metropolitan France and based on the solar time of Paris .
In detail , the railway companies used a unified time which lagged behind Paris solar time by 5 minutes , for the benefit of non - punctual travellers .
In 1911 , Metropolitan France adopted GMT+0 ( the solar time of Greenwich ) as its official time , and used it until 1940 ( with GMT+1 used during the summers from 1916 to 1940 ) .
In the summer of 1940 , the German military authorities switched the occupied northern part of Metropolitan France to GMT+2 ( German summer time ) , while the non - occupied southern part of Metropolitan France remained at GMT+1 ( French summer time ) .
The Vichy authorities kept GMT+1 ( French summer time ) during the winter of 1940–1941 and adopted GMT+2 ( double summer time , which was the same as German summer time ) in May 1941 in order to unify the railway timetables between occupied and non - occupied Metropolitan France .
In 1942 , 1943 , and 1944 the whole of Metropolitan France thus used GMT+2 during the summer , and GMT+1 during the winter .
At the Liberation of France in the summer of 1944 , Metropolitan France kept GMT+2 as it was the time then used by the Allies ( British Double Summer Time ) .
In the winter of 1944–1945 , Metropolitan France switched to GMT+1 , same as in the United Kingdom , and switched again to GMT+2 in April 1945 like its British ally .
In September 1945 , Metropolitan France returned to GMT+1 ( pre - war summer time ) , which the British had already done in July 1945 .
Metropolitan France was officially scheduled to return to GMT+0 on November 18 , 1945 ( the British returned to GMT+0 in on October 7 , 1945 ) , but the French government canceled the decision on November 5 , 1945 , and GMT+1 has since then remained the official time of Metropolitan France .
In 1976 , daylight saving time ( summer time ) was reintroduced in Metropolitan France for the first time since WW2 because of the oil crisis , and since 1976 Metropolitan France has thus been at GMT+1 ( now ) during the winter and GMT+2 ( now ) during the summer .
In 1996 , daylight saving time was harmonized throughout the European Union by Directive 2000/84 / EC , which moved the end of DST to the last Sunday in October .
Since GMT ( now UTC ) is Metropolitan France 's " natural " time zone its use of UTC+1 in winter can be seen as a form of daylight saving time in winter , while Central European Summer Time ( UTC+2 ) can be seen as a form of " double summer time . "
