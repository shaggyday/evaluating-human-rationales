PULMONARY VEIN
The pulmonary veins are the veins that transfer oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart .
The largest pulmonary veins are the four main pulmonary veins , two from each lung that drain into the left atrium of the heart .
The pulmonary veins are part of the pulmonary circulation .
STRUCTURE
Section::::Structure .
Two main pulmonary veins emerge from each lung hilum , receiving blood from three or four bronchial veins apiece and draining into the left atrium .
An inferior and superior main vein drains each lung , so there are four main veins in total .
At the root of the lung , the right superior pulmonary vein lies in front of and a little below the pulmonary artery ; the inferior is situated at the lowest part of the lung hilum .
Behind the pulmonary artery is the bronchus .
The right main pulmonary veins ( contains oxygenated blood ) pass behind the right atrium and superior vena cava ; the left in front of the descending thoracic aorta .
VARIATION Section::::Variation .
Occasionally the three lobar veins on the right side remain separate , and not infrequently the two left lobar veins end by a common opening into the left atrium .
Therefore , the number of pulmonary veins opening into the left atrium can vary between three and five in the healthy population .
The two left lobar veins may be united as a single pulmonary vein in about 25 % of people ; the two right veins may be united in about 3 % .
FUNCTION Section::::Function .
The pulmonary veins play an essential role in respiration , by receiving blood that has been oxygenated in the alveoli and returning it to the left atrium .
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Section::::Clinical significance .
As part of the pulmonary circulation they carry oxygenated blood back to the heart , as opposed to the veins of the systemic circulation which carry deoxygenated blood .
A rare genetic defect of the pulmonary veins can cause them to drain into the pulmonary circulation in whole or in part , this is known as a total anomalous pulmonary venous connection ( or drainage ) , or partial anomalous pulmonary connection , respectively .
