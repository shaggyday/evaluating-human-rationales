BLUE RIDGE PARKWAY
The Blue Ridge Parkway is a National Parkway and All - American Road in the United States , noted for its scenic beauty .
The parkway , which is America 's longest linear park , runs for through 29 Virginia and North Carolina counties , linking Shenandoah National Park to Great Smoky Mountains National Park .
It runs mostly along the spine of the Blue Ridge , a major mountain chain that is part of the Appalachian Mountains .
Its southern terminus is at U.S. 441 on the boundary between Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the Cherokee Indian Reservation in North Carolina , from which it travels north to Shenandoah National Park in Virginia .
The roadway continues through Shenandoah as Skyline Drive , a similar scenic road which is managed by a different National Park Service unit .
Both Skyline Drive and the Virginia portion of the Blue Ridge Parkway are part of Virginia State Route 48 , though this designation is not signed .
The parkway has been the most visited unit of the National Park System every year since 1946 except three ( 1949 , 2013 , and 2016 ) .
Land on either side of the road is owned and maintained by the National Park Service , and in many places parkway land is bordered by United States Forest Service property .
The parkway was on North Carolina 's version of the America the Beautiful quarter in 2015 .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Begun during the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt , the project was originally called the Appalachian Scenic Highway .
Most construction was carried out by private contractors under federal contracts under an authorization by Harold L. Ickes in his role as federal public works administrator .
Work began on September 11 , 1935 , near Cumberland Knob in North Carolina ; construction in Virginia began the following February .
On June 30 , 1936 , Congress formally authorized the project as the Blue Ridge Parkway and placed it under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service .
Some work was carried out by various New Deal public works agencies .
The Works Progress Administration did some roadway construction .
Crews from the Emergency Relief Administration carried out landscape work and development of parkway recreation areas .
Personnel from four Civilian Conservation Corps camps worked on roadside cleanup , roadside plantings , grading slopes , and improving adjacent fields and forest lands .
During World War II , the CCC crews were replaced by conscientious objectors in the Civilian Public Service program .
The parkway 's construction created jobs in the region , but also displaced many residents and created new rules and regulations for landowners , including requirements related to how farmers could transport crops .
Residents could no longer build on their lands without permission , or develop land except for agricultural use .
They were not permitted to use the parkway for any commercial travel but were required to transport equipment and materials on side roads .
The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians were also affected by the parkway , which was built through their lands .
From 1935 to 1940 , they resisted giving up the right - of - way through the Qualla Boundary , and they were successful in gaining more favorable terms from the U.S. government .
Specifically , the revised bill " specified the parkway route , assured the $ 40,000 payment for the tribe 's land , and required the state to build [ a ] regular highway through the Soco Valley " .
( The highway referred to is part of U.S. Route 19 . )
Cherokee leaders participated in the dedications when the Cherokee sections opened in the 1950s .
Construction of the parkway was complete by the end of 1966 with one notable exception .
The stretch including the Linn Cove Viaduct around Grandfather Mountain did not open until 1987 .
The project took over 52 years to complete .
ECOLOGY ALONG THE PARKWAY Section::::Ecology along the parkway .
Flowering shrubs and wildflowers dominate the parkway in the spring , including rhododendrons and dogwoods , moving from valleys to mountains as the cold weather retreats .
Smaller annuals and perennials such as the daisy and aster flower through the summer .
Brilliant autumn foliage occurs later in September on the mountaintops , descending to the valleys by later in October .
Often in early - to - middle October and middle to late April , all three seasons can be seen simply by looking down from the cold and windy parkway to the green and warm valleys below .
October is especially dramatic , as the colored leaves stand out boldly and occur mostly at the same time , unlike the flowers .
Major trees include oak , hickory , and tulip tree at lower elevations and buckeye and ash in the middle , turning into conifers such as fir and spruce at the highest elevations on the parkway .
Trees near ridges , peaks , and passes ( often called gaps or notches ) are often distorted and even contorted by the wind , and persistent rime ice is deposited by passing clouds in the winter .
ROUTE DESCRIPTION Section::::Route description .
The Blue Ridge Parkway tunnels were constructed through the rock â€” one in Virginia and 25 in North Carolina .
Sections of the parkway near the tunnels are often closed in winter .
Because groundwater drips from above with freezing temperatures and a lack of sunlight , ice often accumulates inside these locations despite above - freezing temperatures in the surrounding areas .
The highest point on the parkway ( south of Waynesville , near Mount Pisgah in North Carolina ) is above sea level on Richland Balsam at milepost 431 and is often closed from November to April because of inclement weather such as snow , fog , and even freezing fog from low clouds .
The parkway is carried across streams , railway ravines and cross roads by 168 bridges and six viaducts .
The parkway runs from the southern terminus of Shenandoah National Park 's Skyline Drive in Virginia at Rockfish Gap to U.S. Route 441 ( US 441 ) at Oconaluftee in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park near Cherokee , North Carolina .
There is no fee for using the parkway ; however , commercial vehicles are prohibited without approval from the Park Service Headquarters , near Asheville , North Carolina .
The roadway is not maintained in the winter , and sections which pass over especially high elevations and through tunnels are often impassable and therefore closed from late fall through early spring .
Weather is extremely variable in the mountains , so conditions and closures often change rapidly .
The speed limit is never higher than and lower in some sections .
The parkway uses short side roads to connect to other highways , and there are no direct interchanges with Interstate Highways , making it possible to enjoy wildlife and other scenery without stopping for cross - traffic .
Mileposts along the parkway start at zero at the northeast end in Virginia and count to 469 at the southern end in North Carolina .
The mileposts can be found on the right - hand side of the road while traveling southbound on the parkway .
Major towns and cities along the way include Waynesboro , Roanoke , and Galax in Virginia ; and in North Carolina , Boone and Asheville , where it runs across the property of the Biltmore Estate .
The Blue Ridge Music Center ( also part of the park ) is located in Galax , and Mount Mitchell ( the highest point in eastern North America ) is only accessible via a state highway ( NC 128 ) from the parkway at milepost 355.4 .

CLOSURES Section::::Closures .
It is not unusual for small sections of the parkway to be temporarily closed to repair damage caused by the cold winter climate of the mountains or for other maintenance .
Detours caused by these closures are well marked and are arranged to cause as little disruption as possible , though maintenance such as repaving only warrants a stop / slow switch with a one - lane - only restriction .
Due to serious damage in 2004 from Hurricane Frances , then again by Hurricane Ivan , many areas along the parkway were closed until the spring of 2005 , with two areas that were not fully repaired until the spring of 2006 .
