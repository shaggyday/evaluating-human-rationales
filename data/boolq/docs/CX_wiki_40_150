HISTORY 1903–1918 Section::::History .
Section::::1903–1918 .
The first Ford cars ,
three Model As , were imported into the UK in 1903 and the first dealership in Southampton opened in 1910 .
In 1909 the Ford Motor Company ( England ) Limited was established under the chairmanship of Percival Perry opening an office at 55 Shaftesbury Avenue , London , on 8 March 1911 .
TRAFFORD PARK Section::::Trafford Park .
An assembly plant in an old Tram factory in Trafford Park , Manchester , was opened in 1911 employing 60 people to make the Model T and the company was re - registered as Henry Ford & Son ,
Ltd. This was the first Ford factory outside North America .
At first the cars were assembled from imported chassis and mechanical parts with bodies sourced locally .
Six thousand cars were produced in 1913 and the Model T became the country 's biggest selling car with 30 % of the market .
In 1914 Britain 's first moving assembly line for car production started with 21 cars an hour being built .
After the First World War , the Trafford Park plant was extended , and in 1919 , 41 % of British registered cars were Fords .
CORK Section::::Cork .
In 1917 , a plant opened in Cork , Ireland , initially for tractor manufacture , but from 1921 cars were built as well .
This factory was the first to be purpose built by Ford in Europe .
The company of Henry Ford and Son Limited – Fordson – was officially incorporated on 17 April 1917 , starting its life on the site of an old Cork racecourse .
Its first registered office was at 36 South Mall , Cork .
1918–1939
DAGENHAM Section::::1918–1939 .
Section::::Dagenham .
Although the Manchester plant was served by the Manchester Ship Canal , Ford decided that access to a deep water port was required and in 1923 a new site was chosen by the River Thames at Dagenham , east of London .
1928 FORD MOTOR COMPANY LIMITED , 60 % OWNED BY DEARBORN ALL EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST
BUT NOT
THE USSR Section::::1928
Ford Motor Company Limited , 60 % owned by Dearborn .
Section::::All Europe and the Middle East but not the USSR .
In December 1928 Ford ( since 1924 entirely owned by Henry Ford , his wife and their son Edsel ) announced in London that it had formed a new company , Ford Motor Company Limited , with three US directors and four English directors – including chairman Sir Percy Perry – with a capital of £ 7 million .
This company had acquired all Ford 's European and Middle Eastern business in exchange for 60 % of its capital .
The balance of 40 % of the capital of the new Ford Motor Company Limited , 2.8 million shares of £ 1 each , was now available for public subscription .
These shares were heavily over - subscribed .
There was considerable investing interest from America as US investors had had no previous opportunity of investing in a Henry Ford business .
The new chairman , Sir Percival Perry ( 1878–1956 ) , had been , and now was again , central to the development of Ford in Europe .
Perry 's association with Henry Ford dated from 1905 when Perry became a shareholder of Ford 's first British agency but the very first link between them was earlier , in 1903 .
The two men first met in 1906 in Detroit .
From Britain Perry envisioned Ford making vehicles outside USA and selling them across the British Empire and Europe .
He raced the company 's cars , organised a chain of exclusive dealers and superintended the Trafford Park assembly plant .
In 1919 Henry Ford chose to run operations from Detroit , Perry was determined to run all European business himself .
Perry resigned in May 1919 .
His American managers having failed him Henry Ford offered Perry the chairmanship of this new Ford Motor Company Limited in 1928 .
At the first meeting of shareholders in London on 6 March 1929
Perry reported " during the first three months of our first year we and our associated companies in Europe have delivered upwards of 50,000 Model ' A ' vehicles into the hands of satisfied owners .
The improved Fordson tractor is not yet in production but it is hoped to deliver the first tractors completely manufactured at our Cork works within the next month . "
EUROPE 'S LARGEST CAR PLANT
Section::::Europe 's largest car plant .
Construction started at Dagenham in 1929 , and in October 1931 , Britain 's and Europe 's largest car plant opened producing the Model AA truck and Model A car .
This was at the height of the Depression and
the Model A was too expensive to tax and run in Britain and very few were sold , only five in the first three months .
A smaller car was urgently needed and this came in 1932 with the 933 cc Model Y , a car much more suited to the market and becoming in 1935
Britain 's first £ 100 car ( currently adjusted by inflation £ , adjusted by using average earnings for 2012 : £ 16,300.00 ) .
This was Ford 's first car specifically designed for sale outside North America .
Between 1932 and 1937 over 157,000 were made at Dagenham and Cork and at its peak it captured 41 % of its market sector .
In 1938 , Ford 's Cork factory hit an important milestone , producing its 25,000th vehicle since becoming an assembly plant in 1932 .
In all , 73,000 cars , trucks and tractors had been built at Cork up to that time .
THE ASSOCIATED COMPANIES Section::::The associated companies .
The original 1928 plan was for Canada , having the benefit of imperial - preference tariffs , to manufacture components for Ford assembly plants in the British Empire .
Dagenham was to do , and did , the same for assembly plants in Europe but in 1932 , mired in the financial depression , both France and Germany announced their intention to impose heavy new tariffs on imported components .
In France urgent arrangements were made with Mathis for their plant to be leased by a joint - venture to be known as Matford and devoted to the full manufacture of Ford or Matford products .
more capital was required .
There were consequential exchanges in shareholdings between Dagenham and Dearborn and other shareholders .
INDEPENDENCE Section::::Independence .
As an indication of the British and Irish company 's sense of independence , in 1938 Henry Ford and Harry Ferguson came to ' a handshake agreement ' whereby Ford would manufacture tractors designed by Ferguson using the Ferguson System .
Production commenced in USA in June 1939 and the product was outstandingly successful but Henry Ford was unable to persuade Ford Motor Company Limited to manufacture the Ford - Ferguson though they did merchandise the US made tractors .
In 1945 Ferguson arranged production with Standard Motor Company .
Harry Ferguson sued US Ford for illegal use of his patents asking for compensation of £ 90 million , settled out of court in 1952 .
Charles E. Sorensen 's autobiography
— he was a director of this company — described Ferguson so unfavourably his UK publishers were obliged to scrap all copies and pay costs and Sorensen made a public apology .
WORLD WAR II Section::::World War II .
During the Second World War , the Dagenham plant turned out 360,000 vehicles and a new factory in Trafford Park , Manchester , made 34,000 Rolls - Royce Merlin engines .
1945–1967 Section::::1945–1967 .
After World War II , civilian production resumed and Dagenham made 115,000 vehicles in 1946 and factories in Walthamstow in Essex ( later London ) and Langley in Buckinghamshire ( later Berkshire ) were acquired .
The millionth vehicle made since the Dagenham factory started production in October 1931 rolled from the assembly line on 27 August 1946 , a cream Ford 10 saloon .
1950 DEARBORN BUYS BACK FORD EUROPE Section::::1950
Dearborn buys back Ford Europe .
Henry Ford resigned in 1945 in favour of grandson Henry Ford II and died in April 1947 .
Perry , founder - chairman of Ford Motor Company Limited and each of the Ford Group 's European subsidiaries retired in 1948 .
In 1950 Ford 's controlling interests in the European businesses were sold to Ford Dearborn .
In 1953 , following the death of its Detroit founder , Briggs Motor Bodies , whose parent provided bodies to Ford America , was purchased , giving the company more control of its supplies and so acquiring plants at Doncaster , Southampton , Croydon and Romford .
By 1953 , Ford of Britain directly employed 40,000 people .
1961
DEARBORN BUYS OUT
46 % OWNED BY BRITISH SHAREHOLDERS
Section::::1961 Dearborn buys out 46 % owned by British shareholders .
Until 1960 Ford Motor Company Limited remained a publicly quoted company , its shares freely listed on British exchanges , with more than 10,000 stockholders .
The Ford Motor Company of Dearborn Michigan then held just 54 % of its shares .
That year , after eighteen months of rumour and denial , the US company offered to buy out the other shareholders .
The offer was accepted and Ford completed payment for the other 46 % of Ford Motor Company Limited at the end of January 1961 .
Ford of Britain , properly Ford Motor Company Limited , then became a wholly owned Ford subsidiary .
HALEWOOD , BASILDON , SWANSEA AND CORK
Section::::Halewood , Basildon , Swansea and Cork .
In 1962 , Ford opened a factory at Halewood near Liverpool to make the Anglia .
This ceased to be a Ford plant ( although remained under Ford ownership ) when the last Escort came off the production line in 2000 and was then converted to make the Jaguar X - Type in 2001 , and latterly the Land Rover Freelander .
Halewood was included in the sale of Jaguar and Land Rover to Tata Motors in 2008 , although Ford retained ownership of its transmission works .
Another new factory opened at Basildon in 1964 to make tractors , and in 1965 , a further plant was acquired at Crymlyn Burrows , Swansea to make chassis components and axles .
The Cork factory celebrated the 50-year anniversary in 1967 .
As part of that landmark event , a £ 2 million investment program was announced to re - build , re - equip and modernise the assembly plant .
As a result , the plant was to become the largest and most modern factory of its kind in Ireland .
In the same year Ford of Europe was formed with Henry Ford and Son Limited .
It was as an important partnership from the start .
Another £ 2 million was spent on assembly facilities and operations to ensure that Cork production equalled the highest European standards of quality .
By 1977 , the total area of the plant was well over 450,000 square feet .
The rationalisation plan put in place meant that in 1972 , the Cork plant became a two - car plant that was producing the two best selling cars in Ireland : the Escort and Cortina .
Between them , these two models were accounting for 75 % of Ford sales in Ireland at the time .
The Irish company was also exporting around 4,000 cars ( mostly Escorts ) to Britain .
The Cork plant closed in 1984 .
FORD SEWING MACHINISTS STRIKE OF 1968 Section::::Ford sewing machinists strike of 1968 .
The Ford sewing machinists strike of 1968 was a landmark labour - relations dispute in the United Kingdom .
The strike began on 7 June 1968 , when women sewing machinists at Dagenham plant walked out and were later followed by the machinists at Halewood Body & Assembly plant .
The women were responsible for car seat covers and their strike eventually led to a complete halt to all car production .
The Dagenham sewing machinists walked out when , as part of a regrading exercise , they were informed that their jobs were graded in Category B ( less skilled production jobs ) , instead of Category C ( more skilled production jobs ) , and that they would be paid 15 % less than the full B rate received by men .
The strike ended three weeks after it began following the intervention of Barbara Castle , the Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity .
The deal brokered immediately increased their rate of pay to 8 % below that of men , rising to the full category B rate the following year .
COMMERCIAL VEHICLES Section::::Commercial vehicles .
Ford produced a range of commercial vehicles starting with the Model TT in 1917 .
From 1933 to 1939 these were badged Fordson , this changed to Fordson Thames until 1957 after which it became plain Thames until 1965 .
From 1965 they reverted to Ford .
After the closure of the Trafford Park factory most of the larger commercials were built at Langley .
The truck operation was sold to the Iveco group of Italy in 1986 and became Iveco Ford ( 48 % owned by Ford ) .
The Langley plant closed in 1997 .
2013 END OF MORE THAN 100-YEAR
PRODUCTION SCHEME
Section::::2013 end of more than 100-year production scheme .
At midday on Wednesday , 26 July 2013 Ford ended more than 100 years of vehicle manufacturing in the UK , with end of assembling Transit vans , by moving production of the next generation Transit to the Ford Otosan plant in Turkey .
Ford Southampton plant built 28,000 vans , barely a third of its 2007 production .
