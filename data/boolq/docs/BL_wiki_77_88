DOUBLE CHECK VALVE
A double check valve or double check assembly ( DCA ) is a backflow prevention device designed to protect water supplies from contamination .
It is also a valve used in air brake systems on heavy trucks .
It consists of two check valves assembled in series .
This employs two operating principles : firstly one check valve will still act , even if the other is jammed wide open .
Secondly the closure of one valve reduces the pressure differential across the other , allowing a more reliable seal and avoiding even minor leakage .
Small valves may be so compact as to be barely noticeable , particularly when they are integrated into the bodies of existing taps ( faucets ) .
Larger check valves may be installed with ball valves at the ends , for isolation and testing .
Often , test cocks ( very small ball valves ) are in place to attach test equipment for evaluating whether the double check assembly is still functional .
The double check valve assembly is suitable for prevention of back pressure and back siphonage , but is not suitable for high hazard applications .
It is commonly used on lawn irrigation , fire sprinkler and combi - boiler systems .
If the hazard is higher , even a relatively low hazard such as using antifreeze in the fire sprinkler system , then a more reliable check valve such as a reduced pressure zone device may be mandated .
