SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
The Speaker of the House is the presiding officer of the United States House of Representatives .
The office was established in 1789 by Article I , of the United States Constitution .
The Speaker is the political and parliamentary leader of the House of Representatives , and is simultaneously the House 's presiding officer , de facto leader of the body 's majority party , and the institution 's administrative head .
Speakers also perform various other administrative and procedural functions .
Given these several roles and responsibilities , the Speaker usually does not personally preside over debates .
That duty is instead delegated to members of the House from the majority party .
Neither does the Speaker regularly participate in floor debates .
The Constitution does not require the Speaker to be an elected member of the House of Representatives , although every Speaker thus far has been .
The Speaker is second in the United States presidential line of succession , after the Vice President and ahead of the President pro tempore of the Senate .
The current House Speaker is Congressman Paul Ryan from Wisconsin .
He was elected to the office on October 29 , 2015 , and is the 54th person to serve as Speaker .
On April 11 , 2018 , Ryan announced he would not seek re - election in the 2018 mid - terms , and will also relinquish the office of Speaker when his term ends in 2019 .
SELECTION Section::::Selection .
The House of Representatives elects the Speaker of the House on the first day of every new Congress and in the event of the death , resignation or removal from the Chair of an incumbent Speaker .
The Clerk of the House of Representatives requests nominations : there are normally two , one from each major party ( each party having previously met to decide on its nominee ) .
The Clerk then calls the roll of the Representatives , each Representative indicating the surname of the candidate the Representative is supporting .
Representatives are not restricted to voting for one of the nominated candidates and may vote for any person , even for someone who is not a member of the House at all , and a few individuals have cast protest votes for non - members since 1997 .
They may also abstain by voting " present " .
Although no rule exists , based on tradition and practice from the earliest days of the nation , to be elected speaker a candidate must receive an absolute majority of all votes cast for individuals , i.e. excluding those who abstain .
If no candidate wins such a majority , then the roll call is repeated until a speaker is elected .
The last time repeated votes were required was in 1923 , when the Speaker was elected on the ninth ballot .
The new Speaker is then sworn in by the Dean of the United States House of Representatives , the chamber 's longest - serving member .
In modern practice , the Speaker is chosen by the majority party from among its senior leaders either when a vacancy in the office arrives or when the majority party changes .
Previous Speakers have been minority leaders ( when the majority party changes , as they are already the House party leader , and as the minority leader are usually their party 's nominee for Speaker ) , or majority leaders ( upon departure of the current Speaker in the majority party ) , assuming that the party leadership hierarchy is followed .
In the past , other candidates have included chairpersons of influential standing committees .
Historically , the Democrats have always elevated their minority leader to the speakership upon reclaiming majority control of the House .
However , Republicans have not always followed this leadership succession pattern .
In 1919 , Republicans bypassed James Robert Mann , R - IL , who had been Minority Leader for eight years , and elected a backbencher representative , Frederick H. Gillett , R - MA , to be Speaker .
Mann had " angered many Republicans by objecting to their private bills on the floor " , and was also a protégé of autocratic Speaker Joseph Gurney Cannon ( R - IL18 ) who had been Speaker from 1903 to 1911 , and was still in the House .
Many members " suspected that he [ Mann ] would try to re - centralize power in his hands if elected Speaker " .
It is expected that members of the House vote for their party 's candidate .
If they do not , they usually vote for someone else in their party or vote " present " .
Those who vote for the other party 's candidate often face serious consequences , up to and including the loss of seniority .
The last instance where a representative voted for the other party 's candidate was in 2000 , when Democrat Jim Traficant of Ohio voted for Republican Dennis Hastert .
In response , the Democrats stripped him of his seniority and he lost all of his committee posts .
If the Speaker 's party loses control of the House in an election , and if the Speaker and Majority Leader both remain in the leadership hierarchy , they would become the Minority Leader and Minority Whip , respectively .
As the minority party has historically had one less leadership position after losing the Speaker 's chair , there may be a contest for the remaining leadership positions ; upon losing control of the House after the 2010 election , the Democrats created the position of Assistant Democratic Leader in order to prevent such a contest .
Most Speakers whose party has lost control of the House have not returned to the party leadership ( Tom Foley lost his seat , Dennis Hastert returned to the backbenches and resigned from the House in late 2007 ) .
However , Speakers Joseph William Martin , Jr. and Sam Rayburn did seek the post of Minority Leader in the late 1940s and early 1950s .
Nancy Pelosi is the most recent example of an outgoing Speaker who was elected Minority Leader , after the Democrats lost control of the House in the 2010 elections .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The first Speaker was Frederick Muhlenberg : he was elected as a Pro - Administration candidate to the 1st Congress , an Anti - Administration candidate to the 2nd and 3rd Congresses , and a Republican candidate to the 4th Congress , according to the Biographical Directory of Congress , though Oswald Seidensticker wrote that he was elected as a Federalist for the first four Congresses .
The position of Speaker started to gain its partisan role and its power in legislative development under Henry Clay ( 1811–1814 , 1815–1820 , and 1823–1825 ) .
In contrast to many of his predecessors , Clay participated in several debates , and used his influence to procure the passage of measures he supported — for instance , the declaration of the War of 1812 , and various laws relating to Clay 's " American System " economic plan .
Furthermore , when no candidate received an Electoral College majority in the 1824 presidential election causing the President to be elected by the House , Speaker Clay threw his support to John Quincy Adams instead of Andrew Jackson , thereby ensuring Adams ' victory .
Following Clay 's retirement in 1825 , the power of the speakership once again began to decline , despite speakership elections becoming increasingly bitter .
As the Civil War approached , several sectional factions nominated their own candidates , often making it difficult for any candidate to attain a majority .
In 1855 and again in 1859 , for example , the contest for Speaker lasted for two months before the House achieved a result .
During this time , Speakers tended to have very short tenures .
For example , from 1839 to 1863 there were eleven Speakers , only one of whom served for more than one term .
To date , James K. Polk is the only Speaker of the House later elected President of the United States .
Towards the end of the 19th century , the office of Speaker began to develop into a very powerful one .
At the time , one of the most important sources of the Speaker 's power was his position as Chairman of the Committee on Rules , which , after the reorganization of the committee system in 1880 , became one of the most powerful standing committees of the House .
Furthermore , several Speakers became leading figures in their political parties ; examples include Democrats Samuel J. Randall , John Griffin Carlisle , and Charles F. Crisp , and Republicans James G. Blaine , Thomas Brackett Reed , and Joseph Gurney Cannon .
The power of the Speaker was greatly augmented during the tenure of the Republican Thomas Brackett Reed ( 1889–1891 , 1895–1899 ) .
" Czar Reed " , as he was called by his opponents , sought to end the obstruction of bills by the minority , in particular by countering the tactic known as the " disappearing quorum " .
By refusing to vote on a motion , the minority could ensure that a quorum would not be achieved , and that the result would be invalid .
Reed , however , declared that members who were in the chamber but refused to vote would still count for the purposes of determining a quorum .
Through these and other rulings , Reed ensured that the Democrats could not block the Republican agenda .
The speakership reached its apogee during the term of Republican Joseph Gurney Cannon ( 1903–1911 ) .
Cannon exercised extraordinary control over the legislative process .
He determined the agenda of the House , appointed the members of all committees , chose committee chairmen , headed the Rules Committee , and determined which committee heard each bill .
He vigorously used his powers to ensure that Republican proposals were passed by the House .
In 1910 , however , Democrats and several dissatisfied Republicans joined together to strip Cannon of many of his powers , including the ability to name committee members and his chairmanship of the Rules Committee .
Fifteen years later , Speaker Nicholas Longworth restored much , but not all , of the lost influence of the position .
One of the most influential Speakers in history was Democrat Sam Rayburn .
Rayburn was the longest - serving Speaker in history , holding office from 1940 to 1947 , 1949 to 1953 , and 1955 to 1961 .
He helped shape many bills , working quietly in the background with House committees .
He also helped ensure the passage of several domestic measures and foreign assistance programs advocated by Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman .
Rayburn 's successor , Democrat John W. McCormack ( served 1962–1971 ) , was a somewhat less influential speaker , particularly because of dissent from younger members of the Democratic Party .
During the mid-1970s , the power of the speakership once again grew under Democrat Carl Albert .
The Committee on Rules ceased to be a semi - independent panel , as it had been since 1910 .
Instead , it once again became an arm of the party leadership .
Moreover , in 1975 , the Speaker was granted the authority to appoint a majority of the members of the Rules Committee .
Meanwhile , the power of committee chairmen was curtailed , further increasing the relative influence of the Speaker .
Albert 's successor , Democrat Tip O'Neill , was a prominent Speaker because of his public opposition to the policies of President Ronald Reagan .
O'Neill is the longest continually serving Speaker , from 1977 through 1987 .
He challenged Reagan on domestic programs and on defense expenditures .
Republicans made O'Neill the target of their election campaigns in 1980 and 1982 but Democrats managed to retain their majorities in both years .
The roles of the parties reversed in 1994 when , after spending forty years in the minority , the Republicans regained control of the House with the " Contract with America " , an idea spearheaded by Minority Whip Newt Gingrich .
Speaker Gingrich would regularly clash with Democratic President Bill Clinton , leading to the United States federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996 , in which Clinton was largely seen to have prevailed .
Gingrich 's hold on the leadership was weakened significantly by that and several other controversies , and he faced a caucus revolt in 1997 .
After the Republicans lost House seats in 1998 ( although retaining a majority ) he did not stand for a third term as Speaker .
His successor , Dennis Hastert , had been chosen as a compromise candidate , since the other Republicans in the leadership were more controversial .
Hastert played a much less prominent role than other contemporary Speakers , being overshadowed by House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and President George W. Bush .
The Republicans came out of the 2000 elections with a further reduced majority but made small gains in 2002 and 2004 .
The periods of 2001–2002 and 2003–2007 were the first times since 1953–1955 that there was single - party Republican leadership in Washington , interrupted from 2001–2003 as Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont left the Republican Party to become independent and caucused with Senate Democrats to give them a 51–49 majority .
In the 2006 midterm elections , the Democrats won a majority in the House .
Nancy Pelosi became Speaker when the 110th Congress convened on January 4 , 2007 , making her the first woman to hold the office .
With the election of Barack Obama as President and Democratic gains in both houses of Congress , Pelosi became the first Speaker since Tom Foley to hold the office during single - party Democratic leadership in Washington .
During the 111th Congress , Pelosi was the driving force behind several of Obama 's major initiatives that proved controversial , and the Republicans campaigned against the Democrats ' legislation by staging a " Fire Pelosi " bus tour and regained control of the House in the 2010 midterm elections .
House Minority Leader John Boehner was elected as Speaker .
NOTABLE ELECTIONS Section::::Notable elections .
Historically , there have been several controversial elections to the speakership , such as the contest of 1839 .
In that case , even though the 26th United States Congress convened on December 2 , the House could not begin the speakership election until December 14 because of an election dispute in New Jersey known as the " Broad Seal War " .
Two rival delegations , one Whig and the other Democrat , had been certified as elected by different branches of the New Jersey government .
The problem was compounded by the fact that the result of the dispute would determine whether the Whigs or the Democrats held the majority .
Neither party agreed to permit a speakership election with the opposite party 's delegation participating .
Finally , it was agreed to exclude both delegations from the election and a Speaker was finally chosen on December 17 .
Another , more prolonged fight occurred in 1855 in the 34th United States Congress .
The old Whig Party had collapsed but no single party had emerged to replace it .
Candidates opposing the Democrats had run under a bewildering variety of labels , including Whig , Republican , American ( Know Nothing ) , and simply " Opposition " .
By the time Congress actually met in December 1855 , most of the northerners were concentrated together as Republicans , while most of the southerners and a few northerners used the American or Know Nothing label .
Opponents of the Democrats held a majority in House , with the party makeup of the 234 Representatives being 83 Democrats , 108 Republicans , and 43 Know Nothings ( primarily southern oppositionists ) .
The Democratic minority nominated William Alexander Richardson of Illinois as Speaker , but because of sectional distrust , the various oppositionists were unable to agree on a single candidate for Speaker .
The Republicans supported Nathaniel Prentiss Banks of Massachusetts , who had been elected as a Know Nothing but was now largely identified with the Republicans .
The southern Know Nothings supported first Humphrey Marshall of Kentucky , and then Henry M. Fuller of Pennsylvania .
The voting went on for almost two months with no candidate able to secure a majority , until it was finally agreed to elect the Speaker by plurality vote , and Banks was elected .
The House found itself in a similar dilemma when the 36th Congress met in December 1859 .
Although the Republicans held a plurality , the Republican candidate , John Sherman , was unacceptable to southern oppositionists due to his anti - slavery views , and once again the House was unable to elect a Speaker for several months .
After Democrats allied with southern oppositionists to nearly elect the North Carolina oppositionist William N. H. Smith , Sherman finally withdrew in favor of compromise candidate William Pennington of New Jersey , a former Whig of unclear partisan loyalties , who was finally elected Speaker at the end of January 1860 .
The last speakership elections in which the House had to vote more than once occurred in the 65th and 72nd United States Congress .
In 1917 , neither the Republican nor the Democratic candidate could attain a majority because three members of the Progressive Party and other individual members of other parties voted for their own party .
The Republicans had a plurality in the House but James " Champ " Clark remained Speaker of the House because of the support of the Progressive Party members .
In 1931 , both the Republicans and the Democrats had 217 members with the Minnesota Farmer - Labor Party having one member who served as the deciding vote .
The Farmer - Labor Party eventually voted for the Democrats ' candidate for Speaker , John Nance Garner , who later became Vice President under Franklin Roosevelt .
In 1997 , several Republican congressional leaders tried to force Speaker Newt Gingrich to resign .
However , Gingrich refused since that would have required a new election for Speaker , which could have led to Democrats along with dissenting Republicans voting for Democrat Dick Gephardt ( then Minority Leader ) as Speaker .
After the 1998 midterm elections where the Republicans lost seats , Gingrich did not stand for re - election .
The next two figures in the House Republican leadership hierarchy , Majority Leader Richard Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay , chose not to run for the office .
The chairman of the House Appropriations Committee , Bob Livingston , declared his bid for the speakership , which was unopposed , making him Speaker - designate .
It was then revealed , by Livingston himself , who had been publicly critical of President Bill Clinton 's perjury during his sexual harassment trial , that he had engaged in an extramarital affair .
He opted to resign from the House , despite being urged to stay on by House Democratic leader Gephardt .
Subsequently , chief deputy whip Dennis Hastert was selected as Speaker .
The Republicans retained their majorities in the 2000 , 2002 , and 2004 elections .
The Democrats won a majority of seats in the 2006 midterm elections .
On November 16 , 2006 , Nancy Pelosi , who was then Minority Leader , was selected as Speaker - designate by House Democrats .
When the 110th Congress convened on January 4 , 2007 , she was elected as the 52nd Speaker by a vote of 233 - 202 , becoming the first woman elected Speaker of the House .
Pelosi remained Speaker through the 111th Congress .
For the 112th Congress , Republican John Boehner was unanimously designated Speaker - designate by House Republicans and was elected the 53rd Speaker of the House .
As a show of dissent , nineteen Democratic representatives voted for Democrats other than Pelosi , who had been chosen as House Minority Leader and the Democrats ' candidate for Speaker .
PARTISAN ROLE Section::::Partisan role .
The Constitution does not spell out the political role of the Speaker .
As the office has developed historically , however , it has taken on a clearly partisan cast , very different from the speakership of most Westminster - style legislatures , such as the Speaker of the British House of Commons , which is meant to be scrupulously non - partisan .
The Speaker in the United States , by tradition , is the head of the majority party in the House of Representatives , outranking the Majority Leader .
However , despite having the right to vote , the Speaker usually does not participate in debate .
The Speaker is responsible for ensuring that the House passes legislation supported by the majority party .
In pursuing this goal , the Speaker may use their power to determine when each bill reaches the floor .
They also chair the majority party 's steering committee in the House .
While the Speaker is the functioning head of the House majority party , the same is not true of the President pro tempore of the Senate , whose office is primarily ceremonial and honorary .
When the Speaker and the President belong to the same party , the Speaker tends to play the role in a more ceremonial light , as seen when Dennis Hastert played a very low - key role during the presidency of fellow Republican George W. Bush .
Nevertheless , when the Speaker and the President belong to the same party , there are also times that the Speaker plays a much larger role , and the Speaker is tasked , e.g. , with pushing through the agenda of the majority party , often at the expense of the minority opposition .
This can be seen , most of all , in the speakership of Democratic - Republican Henry Clay , who personally ensured the presidential victory of fellow Democratic - Republican John Quincy Adams .
Democrat Sam Rayburn was a key player in the passing of New Deal legislation under the presidency of fellow Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt .
Republican Joseph Gurney Cannon
( under Theodore Roosevelt ) was particularly infamous for his marginalization of the minority Democrats and centralizing of authority to the speakership .
In more recent times , Speaker Nancy Pelosi played a role in continuing the push for health care reform during the presidency of fellow Democrat Barack Obama .
On the other hand , when the Speaker and the President belong to opposite parties , the public role and influence of the Speaker tend to increase .
As the highest - ranking member of the opposition party ( and de facto Leader of the Opposition ) , the Speaker is normally the chief public opponent of the President 's agenda .
In this scenario , the Speaker is known for undercutting the President 's agenda by blocking measures by the minority party or rejecting bills by the Senate .
One famous instance came in the form of Thomas Brackett Reed ( under Grover Cleveland ) , a Speaker notorious for his successful attempt to force the Democrats to vote on measures where the Republicans had clear majorities , which ensured that Cleveland 's Democrats were in no position to challenge the Republicans in the House .
Joseph Cannon was particularly unique in that he led the conservative " Old Guard " wing of the Republican Party , while his President – Theodore Roosevelt – was of the more progressive clique , and more than just marginalizing the Democrats , Cannon used his power to punish the dissidents in his party and obstruct the progressive wing of the Republican Party .
More modern examples include Tip O'Neill , who was a vocal opponent of President Ronald Reagan 's economic and defense policies ; Newt Gingrich , who fought a bitter battle with President Bill Clinton for control of domestic policy ; Nancy Pelosi , who argued with President George W. Bush over the Iraq War ; and John Boehner , who clashed with President Barack Obama over budget issues and health care .
PRESIDING OFFICER Section::::Presiding officer .
As presiding officer of the House of Representatives , the Speaker holds a variety of powers over the House and is ceremonially the highest - ranking legislative official in the US government .
The Speaker may delegate his powers to a member of the House to act as Speaker pro tempore and preside over the House in the Speaker 's absence ; when this has occurred the delegation has always been to a member of the same party .
During important debates , the Speaker pro tempore is ordinarily a senior member of the majority party who may be chosen for his skill in presiding .
At other times , more junior members may be assigned to preside to give them experience with the rules and procedures of the House .
The Speaker may also designate , with approval of the House , a Speaker pro tempore for special purposes , such as designating a Representative whose district is near Washington , D.C. to sign enrolled bills during long recesses .
Under the Rules of the House , the Speaker , " as soon as practicable after the election of the Speaker and whenever appropriate thereafter " , must deliver to the Clerk of the House a confidential list of Members who are designated to act as Speaker in the case of a vacancy or physical inability of the Speaker to perform their duties .
On the floor of the House , the presiding officer is always addressed as " Mister Speaker " or " Madam Speaker " , even if it is a Speaker pro tempore , and not the Speaker themselves .
When the House resolves itself into a Committee of the Whole , the Speaker designates a member to preside over the Committee as the Chairman , who is addressed as " Mister Chairman " or " Madam Chairwoman " .
To speak , members must seek the presiding officer 's recognition .
The presiding officer also rules on all points of order but such rulings may be appealed to the whole House .
The Speaker is responsible for maintaining decorum in the House and may order the Sergeant - at - Arms to enforce House rules .
The Speaker 's powers and duties extend beyond presiding in the chamber .
In particular , the Speaker has great influence over the committee process .
The Speaker selects nine of the thirteen members of the powerful Committee on Rules , subject to the approval of the entire majority party .
The leadership of the minority party chooses the remaining four members .
Furthermore , the Speaker appoints all members of select committees and conference committees .
Moreover , when a bill is introduced , the Speaker determines which committee will consider it .
As a member of the House , the Speaker is entitled to participate in debate and to vote .
Ordinarily , the Speaker votes only when the Speaker 's vote would be decisive or on matters of great importance , such as constitutional amendments or major legislation .
OTHER FUNCTIONS
Section::::Other functions .
Because joint sessions and joint meetings of Congress are held in the House chamber , the Speaker presides over joint sessions to hear addresses by the President , and joint meetings to hear addresses from foreign leaders or other invited guests .
However , the Twelfth Amendment and require that the President of the Senate preside over joint sessions of Congress assembled to count electoral votes and to certify the results of a presidential election .
The Speaker is also responsible for overseeing the officers of the House : the Clerk , the Sergeant - at - Arms , the Chief Administrative Officer , and the Chaplain .
The Speaker can dismiss any of these officers .
The Speaker appoints the House Historian and the General Counsel and , jointly with the Majority and Minority Leaders , appoints the House Inspector General .
The Speaker is second in the presidential line of succession , immediately after the Vice President , under the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 .
The Speaker is followed in the line of succession by the President pro tempore of the Senate and by the heads of federal executive departments .
To date , the implementation of the Presidential Succession Act has never been necessary and no Speaker has ever acted as President .
Implementation of the law almost became necessary in 1973 after the resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew .
At the time , many believed that President Richard Nixon would resign because of the Watergate scandal , allowing Speaker Carl Albert to succeed to the Presidency .
However , before he resigned , Nixon appointed Gerald Ford as Vice President in accordance with the Twenty - fifth Amendment .
Nevertheless , the United States government takes the Speaker 's place in the line of succession seriously enough that , for example , following the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , Speakers used military jets to fly back and forth to their districts and for other travel until Speaker Boehner discontinued the practice in 2011 .
The Speaker of the House is one of the officers to whom declarations of presidential inability or ability to resume the Presidency must be addressed under the Twenty - fifth Amendment .
