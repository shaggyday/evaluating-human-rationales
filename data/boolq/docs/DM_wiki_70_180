Section::::Early History ( 1845 - 1862 ) .
The Ipswich and Bury Railway Company ( I&BR ) , was formed to build a line from Ipswich to Bury St Edmunds .
Its Act of 21 July 1845 authorised capital of £ 400,000 and it shared many shareholders and directors with the Eastern Union Railway ( EUR ) who were in the process of building their line from Colchester to Ipswich .
The companies also shared the same head office location in Brook Street , Ipswich .
The proposed line was 26.5 miles long , with intermediate stations at Bramford , Claydon , Needham , Stowmarket , Haughley Road , Elmswell and Thurston .
The ground breaking ceremony took place in Ipswich on 1 August 1845 where twelve local worthies ( including the mayor of Ipswich , engineer Peter Bruff and John Chevallier Cobbold ) each filled a wheelbarrow with soil .
Building the line was challenging with problems at Ipswich with tunnel construction and at Stowmarket where the local marsh swallowed up a lot of material with test probes finding the bog was 80 feet deep !
On 26 November 1846 the first test train ran to a temporary station at Bury St Edmunds with stops at most stations on the route with the inevitable lavish celebrations .
The official opening followed on 7 December 1846 when a special train ran from Shoreditch ( later Bishopsgate railway station ) to Bury .
The Board of Trade inspection took place on 15 December 1846 and the line opened for traffic on 24 December .
The existing station at Bury opened in November 1847 .
The EUR and I&BR were worked as one from 1 January 1847 , and formal amalgamation was obtained by Act of 9 July 1847 .
The Eastern Union Railway was taken over by the Eastern Counties Railway in 1854 .
By the 1860s the railways in East Anglia were in financial trouble , and most were leased to the ECR ; they wished to amalgamate formally , but could not obtain government agreement for this until 1862 , when the Great Eastern Railway was formed by amalgamation .
Thus Bury St Edmunds became a GER station in 1862 .

ARCHITECTURE AND LAYOUT Section::::Architecture and layout .
Designed by Sancton Wood ( the architect also of Ipswich and Cambridge railway stations as well as many stations in Ireland , the principal of which is Heuston Station , Dublin ) , the station was formally inaugurated in November 1847 , eleven months after the opening of the Eastern Union Railway 's line from Ipswich .
The most noteworthy feature of the station , which is constructed of red brick with stone dressings , is a pair of towers ( originally linked by an overall roof , removed in 1893 ) on either side of the tracks at the eastern end of the layout .
As first built – as a terminus – the station had four tracks , although in practice only one platform was used before the line was extended to Newmarket in 1854 .
Today a wide space separates the two surviving through tracks , which serve Platform 2 ( for trains from Ipswich ) and Platform 1 ( called at by those heading east ) .
The semi - elliptical brick arch bridge over Northgate Road to the east of the station , which like the station building is a Grade II listed building , has been credited to Frederick Barnes and Charles Russell .
The two platforms are connected by a subway .
GOODS FACILITIES
Section::::Goods facilities .
A goods yard was situated on the down side west of the station .
ENGINE SHED Section::::Engine Shed .
The first engine shed was located immediately west of the railway station when Bury St Edmunds was a terminus station for the Ipswich and Bury Railway .
The opening of the line to Cambridge in 1854 saw the end of this first shed as it was in the way of the new line .
A new engine shed of wooden construction was established on the north side of the line again west of the station .
This shed deteriorated over the years and inclement weather in 1901 finished the structure off .
The Great Eastern Railway , often parsimonious in matters relating to the locomotive department , left it until 1904 before a new three - road brick built shed with a north - light roof was built .
As part of the Ipswich district in 1914 the shed had 30 men under a fitter - in - charge .
The allocation on 1 January 1922 consisted of : !
Class ( LNER classification ) ! !
Wheel Arrangement ! !
Number allocated In 1931 during London & North Eastern Railway operation ( 1923 - 1947 )
17 locomotives were allocated to Bury St Edmunds and Bury was re - allocated to the Cambridge district .
At this time it acquired two sub - sheds at Sudbury and Haverhill .
By 1950 under British Railways this had fallen to 14 but increased to 16 in 1954 .
Although the shed was re - roofed in 1953 , the shed was closed to traffic on 5 January 1959 and demolished later that year .
