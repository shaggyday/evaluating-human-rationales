DUTY - FREE SHOP Duty - free shops ( or stores ) are retail outlets that are exempt from the payment of certain local or national taxes and duties , on the requirement that the goods sold will be sold to travelers who will take them out of the country .
Which products can be sold duty - free vary by jurisdiction , as well as how they can be sold , and the process of calculating the duty or refunding the duty component .
However , some countries impose duty on goods brought into the country , though they had been bought duty - free in another country , or when the value or quantity of such goods exceed an allowed limit .
Duty - free shops are often found in the international zone of international airports , sea ports , and train stations but goods can also be bought duty - free on board airplanes and passenger ships .
They are not as commonly available for road or train travelers , although several border crossings between the United States and both Canada and Mexico have duty - free shops for car travelers .
In some countries , any shop can participate in a reimbursement system , such as Global Blue and Premier Tax Free , wherein a sum equivalent to the tax is paid , but then the goods are presented to customs and the sum reimbursed on exit .
These outlets were abolished for intra - EU travellers in 1999 , but are retained for travelers whose final destination is outside the EU .
They also sell to intra - EU travelers but with appropriate taxes .
Some special member state territories such as Åland , Livigno and the Canary Islands , are within the EU but outside the EU tax union , and thus still continue duty - free sales for all travelers .
Tax Free World Association ( TFWA ) announced that in 2011 Asia - Pacific , with 35 percent of global duty - free and travel retail sales , beat Europe and Americas , with these regions accounting for 34 percent and 23 percent respectively .
31 percent of sales came from the fragrances and cosmetics category , followed by the wine and spirit category with 17 percent and then comes tobacco products .
The world 's largest airport by duty - free sales is South Korea 's Incheon Airport , with US$ 1.85 billion in 2016 , narrowly overtaking Dubai Duty Free with 2016 sales of $ 1.82 billion .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The world 's first duty - free shop was established at Shannon Airport in Ireland by Brendan O'Regan in 1947 and remains open today .
Designed to provide a service for Trans - Atlantic airline passengers typically travelling between Europe and North America whose flights stopped for refuelling on outbound and inbound legs of their journeys , it was an immediate success and has been copied worldwide .
Duty - free shopping was in its infancy when two American entrepreneurs , Charles Feeney and Robert Warren Miller , created what is now Duty Free Shoppers ( DFS ) on 7 November 1960 .
DFS started operations in Hong Kong and spread to Europe and other places around the globe .
Securing the exclusive concession for duty - free sales in Hawaii in the early-1960s created a business breakthrough for DFS , and the company was positioned to focus on Japanese travellers .
DFS continued to innovate , expanding into off - airport duty - free stores and large downtown Galleria stores and grew to become the world 's largest travel retailer .
In 1996 , LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton acquired the interests of Feeney and two other shareholders and today jointly owns DFS with Miller .
In this same period , several locales grew as duty - free shopping destinations .
They are exemplified by Saint Martin and the US Virgin Islands in the Caribbean , Hong Kong and Singapore .
Still others claim prices competitive to duty - free .
Generally , goods are free of duty and tax levied on imports for sale anywhere in the shopping destination .
Merchants may pay inventory / business or other taxes , but their customers usually pay none directly .
The mere absence of duty or other taxes on goods being sold does not assure that they are bargains .
Costs of identical goods from different duty - free sources can vary widely .
They often depend on the presence or absence of nearby competition , e.g. , airport stores , especially if all at any airport are owned by a single firm such as Dufry .
Also , prices can often be driven upward by the costs of buyer convenience , e.g. , in - flight sales by airlines .
Many airlines , such as Emirates , El Al , Singapore Airlines , Middle East Airlines , Ukraine International Airlines , Delta , and Avianca , offer duty - free sales on their flights .
DUTY - FREE SHOPPING AWAY FROM PORTS Section::::Duty - free shopping away from ports .
Some duty - free shops operate in central business districts away from airports or other ports .
In Japan , for example , any visitor whose passport indicates that they have been in the country for less than six months can buy items without paying consumption tax , so long as the total purchase value exceeds ¥ 5,000 and the items will not be consumed in Japan .
Duty - free shops are a mainstay in the Akihabara electronic shopping district of Tokyo .
In Thailand , the King Power chain has shops where duty - free items are pre - purchased and delivered separately to the airport to be picked up on departure .
For certain other purchases , a VAT refund may be claimed at the airport upon departure .
In the Philippines , there is one shopping mall called the Duty Free Philippines Fiestamall , which is located a few miles away from Ninoy Aquino International Airport as opposed to being at the airport itself .
It is the only shopping mall of its kind in the world .
The goods that are sold in this mall are often imported products which come from around the world ( mainly from United States , Asia and Australasia ) and are not found in any other shopping malls in the country , aside from duty - free malls .
Tourists , visitors and returning citizens of Philippines often pay a visit to this mall shortly after their arrival ( since only arriving passengers and their companions are allowed access ) .
In order to gain entry , a passport is needed to be presented and registered at the Customer Registration Counter at the entrance of the mall .
The customer will then be issued a shopping card ; these shopping cards must be presented to the cashier for validation of purchases .
Arriving customers are given a certain tax - free allowance on purchases and anything in excess will be subject to local and national taxes .
In the past , the mall used to only accept US dollars and Philippine peso but in recent years , it had begun accepting other currencies such as Japanese yen , Brunei dollar , Australian dollar , British pound , Canadian dollar , Swiss franc , Saudi riyal , Bahraini dinar , and Thai baht .
Currency exchange booths are also available inside the mall if a customer wishes to exchange currencies into Philippine pesos or US dollars .
Credits cards can also be used for purchasing goods .
In Australia , duty - free shops , once common , have all but disappeared since the introduction of GST in 2000 .
Retailer James Richardson operates several duty - free shops in major cities , but most duty - free shops are now located within international airports .
Residents and tourists are allowed to purchase virtually any physical good within 60 days of departure , which needs to be taken on the outward flight , and claim the GST component back through the Tourist Refund Scheme when passing through customs .
Consumers are now free to fully use their items prior to departure .
This is in contrast prior to 2000 , where all purchases had to be packed by the duty - free store in a sealed clear plastic bag , and could only be broken open by customs staff just prior to departure .
DUTY - FREE OUTSIDE EU PORTS Section::::Duty - free outside EU ports .
Any traveller living in a country outside the EU VAT area is entitled to shop tax - free at participating shops in the EU .
The traveller pays the VAT on goods in the shop in the usual way , and can request a refund when exporting the goods .
To qualify , the traveller must :
* have residency in a non - EU country
* have a maximum stay of six months within the EU * make purchases no more than three months prior to export
* obtain a form from the shop where he or she makes the purchase * present the form , and in certain cases the goods , to a customs officer when leaving the EU , where they will be stamped
Only goods meant for personal use are eligible for the refund .
The stamped forms and receipts can then be sent back to the retailers , or their agents , for a refund .
In most cases , a minimum purchase applies to use the tax - free shopping scheme .
The actual amount of VAT reclaimable depends on the VAT rate applicable in the particular country to the goods purchased , and may be subject to a deduction for administration fees .
SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS Section::::Security considerations .
Travelers on long - haul routes with at least one transit stop between their departure airport and destination airport should be careful to purchase their duty - free alcohol or perfume at the last transit port , as otherwise they may have it confiscated by security when they board at the transit port , as they will be exceeding the current limit on liquids in hand baggage .
This does not apply to passengers transferring within the EU and Singapore on the same day , as long as the liquid item is sealed in a plastic security bag with the receipt showing in the bag .
Arrivals duty - free shops are now becoming more common .
Most of South and Central America , and the Caribbean have such shops , as does SE Asia and Oceania .
Switzerland and Canada are looking to introduce them in 2010 .
This method of retail removes any security problems with the transit of liquids , as they are not carried on aircraft .
Several airlines do not allow sales of certain sharp objects in - flight due to security risk .
Other objects that have sharp parts , such as model airplanes , may be bought in - flight but received at the passengers ' home address for the same reason .
INBOUND DUTY - FREE
Section::::Inbound duty - free .
Some countries or districts , including Argentina , Australia , Brazil , Chile , China , Colombia , Iceland , India , Jamaica , Kenya , Lebanon , Malaysia , New Zealand , Norway , Panama , Philippines , Sri Lanka , Switzerland , Taiwan , Turkey , United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan have inwards duty - free facilities , where arriving passengers can purchase duty - free items immediately before going through customs .
This not only saves the inconvenience of having to carry these items around the world but also solves the security problem mentioned above .
Other countries such as Canada and Sweden have been considering duty - free on arrival .
The European Union does not permit arrivals duty - free stores ; some EU airports sell goods on arrival in the baggage claim area described as " Tax - Free " , but these goods are all tax - paid sales , the local sales tax is discounted .
Normally , discounted liquors or tobacco products can not be bought when arriving into an EU Member State as there is often a high local Excise Duty on these goods as well as the local sales tax ( VAT / IVA / TVA ) which is included in the price .
In some EU Territories the tax on tobaccos and liquors is lower than in other EU countries , which is why the prices still seem competitive and look like duty - free prices .
A good example is the difference in tobacco prices between the UK and Ireland , compared to Spain or Portugal .
LEGAL BASIS Section::::Legal basis .
It is a common feature of most tax systems that taxes are not raised on goods to be exported .
To do so could place the goods at a disadvantage to those from other countries , for example if the tax rate in the territory of sale is higher than the tax rate in the territory of consumption .
Either the tax system allows the goods to be exported without taxes ( stored prior to export in a bonded warehouse ) , or taxes can be claimed back when they are exported ( see VAT ) .
Such exemption also applies to goods supplied for use on ships and aircraft , because they are consumed outside the country .
Businesses supplying such goods can do so tax- and duty - free .
Goods sold to passengers on board ships or aircraft are tax free .
The passenger can either consume them on board , or import them tax - free into the country they are traveling to , so long as they are within the traveler 's duty - free allowance .
Most tax regimes also allow travelers entering a country to bring in a certain amount of goods for personal use without paying tax on them , the so - called " duty - free allowance " ; because it is not economically justifiable to collect the small amounts of tax involved , and would be an inconvenience to the passengers .
A duty - free shop works under the same system .
The goods must be exported intact ( they can not be consumed in the country of sale ) , and they are importing into the destination country under that country 's own tax rules .
In some countries , in order to ensure that goods are exported intact , they are hand - delivered in a closed bag to the passenger at the gate after his ticket is scanned .
In the United States , duty - free shops are technically considered class 9 Bonded Warehouses with regard to the U.S. Customs & Border Protection : * Class 9 .
Bonded warehouse , known as duty - free stores , used for selling , for use outside the Customs territory , conditionally duty - free merchandise owned or sold by the proprietor and delivered from the Class 9 warehouse to an airport or other exit point for exportation by , or on behalf of , individuals departing from the Customs territory for destinations other than foreign trade zones .
Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1555(b)(8)(C ) , Customs territory , for purposes of duty - free stores , means the Customs territory of the U.S. as defined in 101.1(e ) of this chapter , and foreign trade zones ( see part 146 of this chapter ) .
All distribution warehouses used exclusively to provide individual duty - free sales locations and storage cribs with conditionally duty - free merchandise are also Class 9 warehouses .
Moreover , in the U.S. some duty - free stores will sell their goods to domestic passengers with appropriate taxes included .
Alcohol and tobacco products are restricted to international passengers only and subject to the age limitations of 18 and 21 respectively , even though the age one must be to import those items into other countries may be lower .
