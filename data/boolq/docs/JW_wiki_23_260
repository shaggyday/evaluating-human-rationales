PLOT Section::::Plot .
10-year - old Bart Millard lives with his mother and abusive father Arthur in Texas .
One day his mother drops him off at a Christian camp where he meets Shannon .
Upon his return from camp , Bart finds his mother has left and movers are removing her belongings .
He angrily confronts his father , who denies that his abusiveness was the reason she left .
Years later , in high school , Bart and Shannon are dating .
Bart plays football to please his father , but is injured , breaking both ankles and ending his career .
The only elective with openings is music class , so he reluctantly signs up .
Initially , Bart is assigned to be a sound technician , but after overhearing him singing , the director casts him in the lead role in the school production of Oklahoma .
Bart overcomes his reluctance and gives an impressive performance , but does not tell his father , who finds out the night of the show when he happens to see a flyer for the show in a diner .
Arthur suddenly collapses in pain , and finds out he has cancer , which he hides from Bart .
The following morning , Bart antagonizes his father , who smashes a plate over his head .
At church , Shannon sees the blood and presses Bart to open up , but he responds by breaking up with her , and leaves town to seek his fortune in the city .
He joins a band in need of a singer , and convinces Christian music producer Scott Brickell to manage the band and secure a showcase in Nashville .
Bart surprises Shannon and invites her to tour with the band , and is confused when she flatly refuses .
In Nashville , Brickell introduces Bart to established artists Amy Grant and Michael W. Smith , but is unable to convince several record execs to sign the band , who do not believe the band , now performing as " MercyMe " , is good enough .
Devastated , Bart quits the band , but Brickell perceives that Bart needs to resolve issues in his personal life , so Bart reconciles with the band and asks them to wait for him , and leaves to return home .
Bart returns home late at night and is confused to find that his father has prepared breakfast for him the next morning .
His father claims to have become a Christian , but Bart is skeptical and refuses to forgive him , and leaves .
In anger and despair , Arthur smashes his old Jeep , which he had asked Bart to help him restore .
Bart attempts to drive away in his father 's pickup , but discovers the terminal cancer diagnosis , and returns to his father .
He finally forgives his father , and the two form a deep bond , but Arthur soon dies of his illness .
After Arthur 's funeral , Bart rejoins the band and writes " I Can Only Imagine " , and also calls Shannon and apologizes for the first time since their breakup .
Brickell sends the demo tape to several artists , including Grant , who , deeply moved by the song , asks to record it herself as her next single , and Bart , who just wants the song to be heard , accepts .
Grant begins the song , but ca n't bring herself to sing it , and calls Bart on stage from the audience to sing it himself .
Bart 's performance earns an enthusiastic ovation , and he reunites with Shannon , who was also in attendance .
The band releases the song as their first single , achieving success on both Christian and mainstream radio .

The Arizona Republics James Ward gave the film 4/5 stars and wrote , " Too often faith - based films — say anything with Kirk Cameron or the terrible God 's Not Dead series — tend to preach to the choir or hector their audience .
The Erwins ' films — I Can Only Imagine definitely among them — are more inclusive , charitable of spirit and hopeful , all qualities that are always appreciated , be they rooted in Christian faith or otherwise . "
David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a " C – " saying : " There 's a reason why all of these movies are so amateurishly made ; why they all end with links to religious websites ; why they all look like they were shot on an iPhone by a Walmart - brand Janusz Kaminski who lit each interior like the white light of heaven was streaming through every window ...
Art can be affirmation , but affirmation can not be art . "
