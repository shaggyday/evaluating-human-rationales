RED ROCKS
AMPHITHEATRE
Red Rocks Amphitheatre is a rock structure near Morrison , Colorado , west of Denver , where concerts are given in the open - air amphitheatre .
There is a large , tilted , disc - shaped rock behind the stage , a huge vertical rock angled outwards from stage right , several large outcrops angled outwards from stage left and a seating area for up to 9,525 people in between .
At its height , the amphitheatre sits at 6,450 feet , and the surrounding Red Rocks Park covers 868 acres .
The amphitheater is owned and operated by the City and County of Denver , Colorado and is located in Red Rocks Park , part of the Denver Mountain Parks HISTORY Section::::History .
In the first decade of the twentieth century , John Brisben Walker had a vision of artists performing on a stage nestled in the perfect acoustic surroundings of Red Rocks , which likely were used by the Ute tribe in earlier times .
Walker produced a number of concerts between 1906 and 1910 on a temporary platform ; and from his dream , the history of Red Rocks as an entertainment venue began .
It took the natural amphitheatre of Red Rocks over 200 million years to form .
The city of Denver acquired Red Rocks amphitheater from Walker for $ 54,133 , total area of 728 acres .
In addition to the platform , Walker also built the Mount Morrison Cable Incline funicular railway which carried tourists from a base at what is today the parking lot of the amphitheatre up to enjoy the view from the top of Mount Morrison ; the incline operated for about five years beginning in 1909 .
Geologically , the rocks surrounding the amphitheater are representative of the Fountain Formation .
Originally the place was known as the " Garden of the Angels " ( 1870s-1906 ) , and then as " Garden of the Titans " during the Walker years ( 1906â€“1928 ) .
The park , however , had always been known by the folk name of " Red Rocks " , which became its formal name when Denver acquired it in 1928 .
The amphitheater 's rocks are named " Creation Rock " on the north , " Ship Rock " on the south , and " Stage Rock " to the east .
Red Rocks Amphitheatre was designed by Denver architect Burnham Hoyt .
The walls of the amphitheatre contain records dating back to the Jurassic period of 160 million years ago as nearby dinosaur tracks have been discovered as well as fossil fragments of the 40-foot sea serpent Plesiosaur .
In 1927 , George Cranmer , Manager of Denver Parks , convinced the City of Denver to purchase the area of Red Rocks from Walker for the price of $ 54,133 ( $ 737,382 in 2015 dollars ) .
Cranmer convinced Benjamin Franklin Stapleton , the Mayor of Denver , Colorado , to build on the foundation laid by Walker .
By enlisting the help of the Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) , and Works Progress Administration ( WPA ) , labor and materials were provided for the venture .
Construction of the amphitheatre began in 1936 and was opened to the public in June 1941 .

Approximately 1,000 people without tickets arrived at the sold - out show .
Denver police directed the overflow , non - paying crowd to an area behind the theater , where they could hear the music but not see the band .
The situation seemed satisfactory until some of the people without tickets attempted to enter the amphitheatre by charging at , and breaking through , the police line .
Some of those without tickets began lobbing rocks at the police , and the police responded by discharging tear gas at the gate - crashers .
The wind carried the tear gas over the hill , into the paying crowd and onto the stage .
Following the " Riot at Red Rocks , " Denver Mayor William H. McNichols , Jr. banned rock concerts from the amphitheatre .
For the next five years , shows at Red Rocks were limited to softer acts , such as John Denver , Sonny & Cher , The Carpenters , Pat Boone , Seals & Crofts , and Carole King .
The ban on rock and roll was finally lifted through legal action taken by Denver concert promoter Barry Fey , who tried to book the band America at the venue in 1975 .
