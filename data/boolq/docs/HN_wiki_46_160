CLOUD DATABASE
A cloud database is a database that typically runs on a cloud computing platform , access to it is provided as a service .
Database services take care of scalability and high availability of the database .
Database services make the underlying software - stack transparent to the user .
DEPLOYMENT MODELS Section::::Deployment models .
There are two primary methods to run a database in a cloud : Virtual machine image : Cloud platforms allow users to purchase virtual - machine instances for a limited time , and one can run a database on such virtual machines .
Users can either upload their own machine image with a database installed on it , or use ready - made machine images that already include an optimized installation of a database .
Database - as - a - service ( DBaaS ) :
With a database as a service model , application owners do not have to install and maintain the database themselves .
Instead , the database service provider takes responsibility for installing and maintaining the database , and application owners are charged according to their usage of the service .
ARCHITECTURE AND COMMON CHARACTERISTICS
* Most database services offer web - based consoles , which the end user can use to provision and configure database instances .
* Database services consist of a database - manager component , which controls the underlying database instances using a service API .
The service API is exposed to the end user , and permits users to perform maintenance and scaling operations on their database instances .
* Underlying software - stack stack typically includes the operating system , the database and third - party software used to manage the database .
The service provider is responsible for installing , patching and updating the underlying software stack and ensuring the overall health and performance of the database .
*
Scalability features differ between vendorssome offer auto - scaling , others enable the user to scale up using an API , but do not scale automatically .
There is typically a commitment for a certain level of high availability ( e.g. 99.9 % or 99.99 % ) .
DATA MODEL Section::::Data model .
The design and development of typical systems utilize data management and relational databases as their key building blocks .
Advanced queries expressed in SQL work well with the strict relationships that are imposed on information by relational databases .
However , relational database technology was not initially designed or developed for use over distributed systems .
This issue has been addressed with the addition of clustering enhancements to the relational databases , although some basic tasks require complex and expensive protocols , such as with data synchronization .
Modern relational databases have shown poor performance on data - intensive systems , therefore , the idea of NoSQL has been utilized within database management systems for cloud based systems .
Within NoSQL implemented storage , there are no requirements for fixed table schemas , and the use of join operations is avoided .
"
The NoSQL databases have proven to provide efficient horizontal scalability , good performance , and ease of assembly into cloud applications . "
It is also important to differentiate between cloud databases which are relational as opposed to non - relational or NoSQL :
SQL databases : are one type of database which can run in the cloud , either in a virtual machine or as a service , depending on the vendor .
While SQL databases are easily vertically scalable , horizontal scalability poses a challenge , that cloud database services based on SQL have started to address .
NoSQL databases : are another type of database which can run in the cloud .
NoSQL databases are built to service heavy read / write loads and can scale up and down easily , and therefore they are more natively suited to running in the cloud .
: However , most contemporary applications are built around an SQL data model , so working with NoSQL databases often requires a complete rewrite of application code .
