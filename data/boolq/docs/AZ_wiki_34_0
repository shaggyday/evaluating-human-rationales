HISTORY OF MOSCOW
The city of Moscow gradually grew around the Moscow Kremlin , beginning in the 14th century .
It was the capital of the Grand Duchy of Moscow ( or Muscovy ) , from 1340 to 1547 and in 1713 renamed as the Tsardom of Russia by Peter I
" the Great " ( when the capital was moved to Saint Petersburg ) .
Moscow was the capital of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1918 , which then became the Soviet Union ( 1922 to 1991 ) , and since 1991 has served as capital of the Russian Federation .
Situated on either bank of the eponymous Moskva River , the city during the 16th to
17th centuries grew up in five concentric divisions , formerly separated from one another by walls : the Kremlin ( " fortress " ) , Kitaigorod ( " walled town " , but interpreted as " Chinatown " by folk etymology ) , Bielygorod ( " white town " ) , Zemlianoigorod ( " earthworks town " ) , and Miestchanskygorod ( " bourgeois town " ) outside the city walls .
After the fire of 1812 , the city ramparts were replaced with the Boulevard Ring and Garden Ring roads , replacing the walls around Bielygorod and Zemlianoigorod , respectively .
The city 's population grew from 250,000 to over a million in the 19th century , and from one to ten million in the 20th century , putting it among the top twenty of the world 's most populous cities today .
PREHISTORY Section::::Prehistory .
The oldest evidence of humans on the territory of Moscow dates from the Neolithic ( Schukinskaya site on the Moscow River ) .
Within the modern bounds of the city other late evidence was discovered ( the burial ground of the Fatyanovskaya culture , the site of the Iron Age settlement of the Dyakovo culture ) , on the territory of the Kremlin , Sparrow Hills , Setun River and Kuntsevskiy forest park , etc .
The etymology of the name Moskva ( originally Moskha , later when Slavic tribes conquered the city transformеd to Moscow because of the specificity of the Slavic languages ) is probably Uralic , perhaps Volga - Finnic ( Mordvinic or Merya ) .
In the 9th century , the Oka River was part of the Volga trade route , and the upper Volga watershed became an area of contact between the indigenous Uralic peoples such as the Merya and the expanding Volga Bulgars ( particularly the second son of Khan Kubrat who expanded the borders of the Old Great Bulgaria ) , Germanic ( Varangians ) and Slavic peoples .
The earliest East Slavic tribes recorded as having expanded to the upper Volga in the 9th to 10th centuries are the Vyatichi and Krivichi .
The Moskva River was incorporated as part of Rostov - Suzdal into the Kievan Rus in the 11th century .
By AD 1100 , a minor settlement had appeared on the mouth of the Neglinnaya River .
EARLY HISTORY ( 1147–1283 )
Section::::Early history ( 1147–1283 ) .
The first reference to Moscow dates from 1147 as a meeting place of Yuri Dolgorukiy and Sviatoslav Olgovich .
At the time it was a minor town on the western border of Vladimir - Suzdal Principality .
In 1156 , Kniaz Yury Dolgoruky fortified the town with a timber fence and a moat .
In the course of the Mongol invasion of Rus , the Golden Horde burned the city to the ground and killed its inhabitants .
The timber fort na Moskvě " on the Moscow river " was inherited by Daniel , the youngest son of Alexander Nevsky , in the 1260s , at the time considered the least valuable of his father 's possessions .
Daniel was still a child at the time , and the fort was governed by tiuns ( deputies ) , appointed by Daniel 's paternal uncle , Yaroslav of Tver .
Daniel came of age in the 1270s and became involved in the power struggles of the principality with lasting success , siding with his brother Dmitry in his bid for the rule of Novgorod .
From 1283 he acted as the ruler of an independent principality alongside Dmitry , who became Grand Duke of Vladimir .
Daniel has been credited with founding the first Moscow monasteries , dedicated to the Lord 's Epiphany and to Saint Daniel .
GRAND DUCHY ( 1283–1547 )
Section::::Grand Duchy ( 1283–1547 ) .
Daniel ruled Moscow as Grand Duke until 1303 and established it as a prosperous city which would eventually eclipse its parent principality of Vladimir by the 1320s .
In 1282 Daniel founded the first monastery of Moscow on the right bank of the Moskva River , the wooden church of St. Daniel - Stylite .
It is now known as the Danilov Monastery .
Daniel died in 1303 , at the age of 42 .
Before his death he became a monk and , according to his will , was buried in the cemetery of the St. Daniel Monastery .
Moscow was stable and prosperous for many years and attracted a large numbers of refugees from across Russia .
The Rurikids maintained large landholdings by practicing primogeniture , whereby all land was passed to the eldest sons , rather than dividing it up among all sons .
By 1304 , Yury of Moscow contested with Mikhail of Tver for the throne of the principality of Vladimir .
Ivan I eventually defeated Tver to become the sole collector of taxes for the Mongol rulers , making Moscow the capital of Vladimir - Suzdal .
By paying high tribute , Ivan won an important concession from the Khan .
While Khan of the Golden Horde initially attempted to limit Moscow 's influence , when the growth of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania began to threaten all of Russia , the Khan strengthened Moscow to counterbalance Lithuania , allowing it to become one of the most powerful cities in Russia .
In 1380 , prince Dmitry Donskoy of Moscow led a united Russian army to an important victory over the Mongols in the Battle of Kulikovo .
Afterwards , Moscow took the leading role in liberating Russia from Mongol domination .
In 1480 , Ivan III had finally broken the Russians free from Tatar control , and Moscow became the capital of an empire that would eventually encompass all of Russia and Siberia , and parts of many other lands .
In 1462 Ivan III , known as Ivan the Great ( 1440–1505 ) became Grand Prince of Moscow ( then part of the medieval Muscovy state ) .
He began fighting the Tatars , enlarged the territory of Muscovy , and enriched his capital city .
By 1500 it had a population of 100,000 and was one of the largest cities in the world .
He conquered the far larger principality of Novgorod to the north , which had been allied to the hostile Lithuanians .
By this conquest Ivan III enlarged his territory seven - fold , expanding from 430,000 to 2,800,000 square kilometers .
He took control of the ancient " Novgorod Chronicle " and made it a propaganda vehicle for his regime .
The original Moscow Kremlin was built during the 14th century .
It was reconstructed by Ivan , who in the 1480s invited architects from Italy , such as Petrus Antonius Solarius , who designed the new Kremlin wall and its towers , and Marco Ruffo who designed the new palace for the prince .
The Kremlin walls as they now appear are those designed by Solarius , completed in 1495 .
The Kremlin 's Great Bell Tower was built in 1505–08 and augmented to its present height in 1600 .
A trading settlement , or posad , grew up to the east of the Kremlin , in the area known as Zaradye ( Зарядье ) .
In the time of Ivan III , the Red Square , originally named the Hollow Field ( Полое поле ) appeared .
In 1508–1516 , the Italian architect Aleviz Fryazin ( Novy ) arranged for the construction of a moat in front of the eastern wall , which would connect the Moskva and Neglinnaya and be filled in with water from Neglinnaya .
This moat , known as the Alevizov moat and having a length of 541 meters , width of 36 meters , and a depth of 9.5–13 m was lined with limestone and , in 1533 , fenced on both sides with low , 4-meter thick cogged brick walls .
TSARDOM ( 1547–1721 )
Section::::Tsardom ( 1547–1721 ) .
In the 16th and 17th centuries , the three circular defenses were built : Kitay - gorod ( Китай - город ) , the White City ( Белый город ) and the Earthen City ( Земляной город ) .
However , in 1547 , two fires destroyed much of the town , and in 1571 the Crimean Tatars captured Moscow , burning everything except the Kremlin .
The annals record that only 30,000 of 200,000 inhabitants survived .
The Crimean Tatars attacked again in 1591 , but this time were held back by new defense walls , built between 1584 and 1591 by a craftsman named Fyodor Kon .
In 1592 , an outer earth rampart with 50 towers was erected around the city , including an area on the right bank of the Moscow River .
As an outermost line of defense , a chain of strongly fortified monasteries was established beyond the ramparts to the south and east , principally the Novodevichy Convent and Donskoy , Danilov , Simonov , Novospasskiy , and Andronikov monasteries , most of which now house museums .
From its ramparts , the city became poetically known as Bielokamennaya , the " White - Walled " .
The limits of the city as marked by the ramparts built in 1592 are now marked by the Garden Ring .
Three square gates existed on the eastern side of the Kremlin wall , which in the 17th century , were known as : Konstantino - Eleninsky , Spassky , Nikolsky ( owing their names to the icons of Constantine and Helen , the Savior and St. Nicholas which hung over them ) .
The last two were directly opposite the Red Square , while the Konstantino - Elenensky gate was located behind Saint Basil 's Cathedral .
The Russian famine of 1601–1603 killed perhaps 100,000 in Moscow .
From 1610 through 1612 , troops of the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth occupied Moscow , as its ruler Sigismund III tried to take the Russian throne .
In 1612 , the people of Nizhny Novgorod and other Russian cities conducted by prince Dmitry Pozharsky and Kuzma Minin rose against the Polish occupants , besieged the Kremlin , and expelled them .
In 1613 , the Zemsky sobor elected Michael Romanov tsar , establishing the Romanov dynasty .
During the first half of the 17th century , the population of Moscow doubled from roughly 100,000 to 200,000 .
It expanded beyond its ramparts in the later 17th century .
By 1682 , there were 692 households established north of the ramparts , by Ukrainians and Belarusians abducted from their hometowns in the course of Russo - Polish War ( 1654–1667 ) .
These new outskirts of the city came to be known as the Meshchanskaya sloboda , after Ruthenian meshchane " town people " .
The term meshchane ( мещане ) acquired pejorative connotations in 18th - century Russia and today means " petty bourgeois " or " narrow - minded philistine " .
The entire city of the late 17th century , including the slobodas which grew up outside of the city ramparts , are contained within what is today Moscow 's Central Administrative Okrug .
Numerous disasters befell the city .
The plague killed upwards of 80 % of the people in 1654–55 .
Fires burned out much of the wooden city in 1626 and 1648 .
EMPIRE ( 1721–1917 ) Section::::Empire ( 1721–1917 ) .
Moscow ceased to be Russia 's capital ( except for a brief period from 1728 to 1732 under the influence of the Supreme Privy Council )
when Peter the Great moved his government to the newly built Saint Petersburg on the Baltic coast in 1712 .
After losing the status as capital of the empire , the population of Moscow at first decreased , from 200,000 in the 17th century to 130,000 in 1750 .
But after 1750 , the population grew more than tenfold over the remaining duration of the Russian Empire , reaching 1.8 million by 1915 .
By 1700 , the building of cobbled roads had begun .
In November 1730 , the permanent street light was introduced , and by 1867 many streets had a gaslight .
In 1883 , near the Prechistinskiye Gates , arc lamps were installed .
In 1741 Moscow was surrounded by a barricade 25 miles long , the Kamer - Kollezhskiy barrier , with 16 gates at which customs tolls were collected .
Its line is traced today by a number of streets called val ( " ramparts " ) .
Between 1781–1804 the Mytischinskiy water - pipe ( the first in Russia ) was built .
In 1813 a Commission for the Construction of the City of Moscow was established .
It launched a great program of rebuilding , including a partial replanning of the city - center .
Among many buildings constructed or reconstructed at this time were the Grand Kremlin Palace and the Kremlin Armoury , the Moscow University , the Moscow Manege ( Riding School ) , and the Bolshoi Theatre .
In 1903 the Moskvoretskaya water - supply was completed .
In the early 19th century , the Arch of Konstantino - Elenensky gate was paved with bricks , but the Spassky Gate was the main front gate of the Kremlin and used for royal entrances .
From this gate , wooden and ( following the 17th - century improvements ) stone bridges stretched across the moat .
Books were sold on this bridge and stone platforms were built nearby for guns - " raskats " .
The Tsar Cannon was located on the platform of the Lobnoye mesto .
The road connecting Moscow with St. Petersburg , now the M10 highway , was completed in 1746 , its Moscow end
following the old Tver road which had existed since the 16th century .
It became known as Peterburskoye Schosse after it was paved in the 1780s .
Petrovsky Palace was built in 1776–1780 by Matvey Kazakov as a railway station specifically reserved for royal journeys from Saint Petersburg to Moscow , while coaches for lesser classes arrived and departed from Vsekhsvyatskoye station .
When Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812 , the Moscovites were evacuated .
It is suspected today that the Moscow fire which ensued initially started as a result of Russian sabotage .
In the fire 's wake , an estimated three - quarters of the city lay in ruin .
Moscow State University was established in 1755 .
Its main building was reconstructed after the 1812 fire by Domenico Giliardi .
The Moskovskiye Vedomosti newspaper appeared from 1756 , originally in weekly intervals , and from 1859 as a daily newspaper .
The Arbat Street had been in existence since at least the 15th century , but it was developed into a prestigious area during the 18th century .
It was destroyed in the fire of 1812 and was rebuilt completely in the early 19th century .
In the 1830s , general Alexander Bashilov planned the first regular grid of city streets north from Petrovsky Palace .
Khodynka field south of the highway was used for military training .
Smolensky Rail station ( forerunner of present - day Belorussky Rail Terminal ) was inaugurated in 1870 .
Sokolniki Park , in the 18th century the home of the tsar 's falconers well outside of Moscow , became contiguous with the expanding city in the later 19th century and was developed into a public municipal park in 1878 .
The suburban Savyolovsky Rail Terminal was built in 1902 .
In January 1905 , the institution of the City Governor , or Mayor , was officially introduced in Moscow , and Alexander Adrianov became Moscow 's first official mayor .
When Catherine II came to power in 1762 , the city 's filth and smell of sewage was depicted by observers as a symptom of disorderly life styles of lower - class Russians recently arrived from the farms .
Elites called for improving sanitation , which became part of Catherine 's plans for increasing control over social life .
National political and military successes from 1812 through 1855 calmed the critics and validated efforts to produce a more enlightened and stable society .
There was less talk about the smell and the poor conditions of public health .
However , in the wake of Russia 's failures in the Crimean War in 1855–56 , confidence in the ability of the state to maintain order in the slums eroded , and demands for improved public health put filth back on the agenda .
SOVIET ERA ( 1917–1991 ) Section::::Soviet era ( 1917–1991 ) .
Following the success of the Russian Revolution of 1917 , Vladimir Lenin , fearing possible foreign invasion , moved the capital from Saint Petersburg back to Moscow on March 5 , 1918 .
In the beginning of the 20th century , several strikes and armed risings in Moscow paved the way to the October Revolution .
In 1918 the Bolsheviks moved the seat of government from Saint Petersburg back to Moscow .
During the Great Patriotic War , the Soviet State Committee of Defense and the General Staff of the Red Army were located in Moscow .
In 1941 , 16 divisions of the national volunteers ( more than 160,000 people ) , 25 battalions ( 18,000 people ) and 4 engineering regiments were formed among the Muscovites .
In November 1941 , German Army Group Centre was stopped at the outskirts of the city and then driven off in the course of the Battle of Moscow .
Many factories were evacuated , together with much of the government , and from October 20 the city was declared to be in a state of siege .
Its remaining inhabitants built and manned antitank defenses , while the city was bombarded from the air .
On May 1 , 1944 a medal " For the defense of Moscow " and in 1947 another medal " In memory of the 800th anniversary of Moscow " were instituted .
During the postwar years , there was a serious housing crisis , solved by the invention of high - rise apartments .
There are about 13,000 of these standardized and prefabricated apartment block , housing the majority of Moscow 's population .
Apartments were built and partly furnished in the factory before being raised and stacked into tall columns .
The popular Soviet - era comic film Irony of Fate parodies this construction method .
The city of Zelenograd was built in 1958 at 37 km from the city center to the north - west , along the Leningradskoye Shosse , and incorporated as one of Moscow 's administrative ogrkugs .
Moscow State University moved to its campus on Sparrow Hills in 1953 .
On May 8 , 1965 due to the actual 20th anniversary of the victory in World War II Moscow was awarded a title of the Hero City .
In 1980 it hosted the Summer Olympic Games .
The MKAD ring road was opened in 1961 .
It had four lanes running 109 km along the city borders .
The MKAD marked the administrative boundaries of the city of Moscow until the 1980s , when outlying suburbs beyond the ring road began to be incorporated .
In 1991 Moscow was the scene of a coup attempt by conservators opposed to the liberal reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev .
METRO Section::::Metro .
The Moscow Metro opened in 1935 and immediately became the centerpiece of the transportation system .
More than that it was a Stalinist device to awe and control the populace , and give them an appreciation of Soviet realist art .
It became the prototype for future Soviet large - scale technologies .
Lazar Kaganovich was in charge ; he designed the subway so that citizens would absorb the values and ethos of Stalinist civilization as they rode .
The artwork of the 13 original stations became nationally and internationally famous .
For example , the Sverdlov Square subway station featured porcelain bas - reliefs depicting the daily life of the Soviet peoples , and the bas - reliefs at the Dynamo Stadium sports complex glorified sports and the physical prowess of the powerful new " Homo Sovieticus . " ( Soviet man ) .
The metro was touted as the symbol of the new social order — a sort of Communist cathedral of engineering modernity .
Soviet workers did the labor and the art work , but the main engineering designs , routes , and construction plans were handled by specialists recruited from the London Underground .
The Britons called for tunneling instead of the " cut - and - cover " technique , the use of escalators instead of lifts , and designed the routes and the rolling stock .
The paranoia of Stalin and the NKVD was evident
when the secret police arrested numerous British engineers for espionage — that is for gaining an in - depth knowledge of the city 's physical layout .
Engineers for the Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Company were given a show trial and deported in 1933 , ending the role of British business in the USSR .
Until nowadays Moscow metro is one of the most important heritage of architecture of the USSR period .
The most inspiring metro stations of the Stalin 's era are Revolution Square , Kievskaya , Beloruskaya , Mayakovskaya , Novoslobodskaya , Dostoevskaya , Prospekt mira , Komsomolskaya and Taganskaya .
RECENT HISTORY ( 1991 TO PRESENT ) Section::::Recent history ( 1991 to present ) .
When the USSR was dissolved in the same year , Moscow became a capital of the Russian Federation .
Since then a market economy has emerged in Moscow , producing an explosion of Western - style retailing , services , architecture , and lifestyles .
Even with Russia 's population shrinking by 6 million after the fall of the USSR , Moscow has continued to grow during the 1990s to 2000s , its population rising from below nine to above ten million .
Mason and Nigmatullina argue that Soviet - era urban - growth controls ( before 1991 ) produced controlled and sustainable metropolitan development , typified by the greenbelt built in 1935 .
Since then however , there has been a dramatic growth of low - density suburban sprawl , created by a heavy demand for single - family dwellings as opposed to crowded apartments .
In 1995–1997 the MKAD ring road was widened from the initial four to ten lanes .
In December 2002 Bulvar Dmitriya Donskogo became the first Moscow Metro station that opened beyond the limits of MKAD .
The Third Ring Road , intermediate between the early 19th - century Garden Ring and the Soviet era outer ring road , was completed in 2004 .
The greenbelt is becoming more and more fragmented , and satellite cities are appearing at the fringe .
Summer dachas are being converted into year - round residences , and with the proliferation of automobiles there is heavy traffic congestion .
