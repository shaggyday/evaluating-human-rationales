DOUBLE DECKER
( CHOCOLATE BAR )
Double Decker is a British brand of chocolate bar currently manufactured by Cadbury .
First introduced in the UK in 1976 , its name derives from the well - known double - decker bus , and the buses have sometimes appeared in advertisements for the product .
It is a mixture of milk chocolate , nougat , and rice crispies .
This has proved to be a very popular recipe , being used in cakes and other confections .
DESCRIPTION Section::::Description .
The chocolate bar is structured in two layers ; a lightly - whipped nougat layer , with a lower layer of cereal ' crispies ' , these are then coated in milk chocolate .
Originally the bar contained raisins within the base layer ; however , consumer research in the mid-1980s led to these being removed and the current formulation being introduced .
Television adverts in the 1970s featured Willie Rushton before a mascot named Dougie the Double Decker Dog was introduced .
The bar has a mass of approximately 54.5 g although multipack bars are smaller at 47 g .
This increased from 42 g in the 1970s and 51 g in the 1980s , to a peak of 60 g before attaining the current weight .
It typically contains 9.9 g of fat , 38 g of carbohydrates , 2.3 g of protein and 1060kJ ( 250kcal ) of energy .
The Double Decker no longer contains hydrogenated oil .
The bar is manufactured in Poland .
There also existed a ' Double Decker â€“ Nuts ' launched in 2004 , which had the advertising slogan " crispy , crunchy , chewy and nutty " .
This chocolate bar was essentially a Double Decker with nuts contained within the nougat layer ; however , it has since been discontinued .
At the time it was distinctly aimed at males , and featured in Coronation Street credits during 2004 .
In August 2016 Cadbury launched Dinky Deckers as part of the Bite Size bag range which are mini Cadbury Double Deckers available in a 120 g pouch bag .
