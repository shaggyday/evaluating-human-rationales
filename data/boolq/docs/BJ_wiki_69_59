HISTORY Section::::History .
Seattle 's Best Coffee began as a combination ice cream and coffee shop called the Wet Whisker in Coupeville on Whidbey Island , northwest of Seattle , Washington in 1969 .
Founder Jim Stewart purchased green coffee beans from local roasters to be roasted and sold at the Wet Whisker .
By the end of the second summer , the shop had roasted and sold nearly 500 pounds ( 226 kg ) of coffee .
By the end of the following year , the Vashon Island Wet Whisker was sold , and Jim Stewart , along with his brother Dave , opened another ice cream and coffee store on Pier 70 on Seattle 's Waterfront .
The shop was called Stewart Brothers Wet Whisker .
In 1982 , Stewart Brothers Wet Whisker began serving espresso based beverages alongside other coffee products .
In 1983 , the name again changed from Stewart Brothers Wet Whisker to Stewart Brothers Coffee .
Shortly after , business began to expand , and new shops opened in Bellevue , Washington , and in Seattle 's historic Pike Place Market a year later .
In 1991 , the company was renamed " Seattle 's Best Coffee " after winning a local competition .
Around 1995 , Seattle 's Best Coffee was purchased by a group of investors who own Torrefazione Italia .
They formed a new company made up of both parties called Seattle Coffee Holdings .
In 1997 , Seattle Coffee Holdings changed its name to Seattle Coffee Company .
In 1998 , AFC Enterprises purchased Seattle Coffee Holdings and began franchising the Seattle 's Best Coffee brand .
During AFC Enterprise 's ownership , Seattle Coffee Company 's Vashon Island roasterie was upgraded and the company 's organic coffee line was established .
AFC Enterprises sold SBC to Starbucks in July 2003 , retaining franchise rights in eleven countries , Hawaii and U.S. military bases .
Starbucks closed the Vashon Island facility October 23 , 2003 and moved production to their Kent , Washington roasterie .
The historic Vashon Island roasterie building , Jim Stewart 's original 1952 roaster , and roastmaster Peter Larsen , while no longer affiliated with SBC or Starbucks , continue operations as " The Vashon Island Coffee Roasterie " .
