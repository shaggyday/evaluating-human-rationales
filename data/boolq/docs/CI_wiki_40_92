MOBILE PHONE JAMMER
A mobile phone jammer or blocker is a device which deliberately transmits signals on the same radio frequencies as mobile phones , disrupting the communication between the phone and the cell - phone base station , effectively disabling mobile phones within the range of the jammer , preventing them from receiving signals and from transmitting them .
Jammers can be used in practically any location , but are found primarily in places where a phone call would be particularly disruptive because silence is expected , such as entertainment venues .
Because they disrupt the operations of legitimate mobile phone services , the use of such blocking devices is illegal in many jurisdictions , especially without a licence .
When operational , such devices also block access to emergency services .
