INDEFINITE LEAVE TO REMAIN
Indefinite leave to remain ( ILR ) or permanent residency ( PR ) is an immigration status granted to a person who does not hold the right of abode in the United Kingdom ( UK ) , but who has been admitted to the UK without any time limit on his or her stay and who is free to take up employment or study .
When indefinite leave is granted to persons outside the United Kingdom it is known as indefinite leave to enter ( ILE ) .
A person who has indefinite leave to remain , the right of abode or Irish citizenship has settled status if resident in the United Kingdom ( all full British citizens have the right of abode ) .
Indefinite leave is not a permanent status .
It can lapse where the holder has stayed outside the United Kingdom for a continuous period of more than two years .
Settled status is central to British nationality law , as the most usual route to naturalisation or registration as a British citizen requires that the applicant be settled in the UK .
Settled status is also important where a child of non - British citizen parents is born in the UK , as unless at least one parent has settled status the child will not automatically be a British citizen .
ADVANTAGES
ACQUISITION OF BRITISH CITIZENSHIP Section::::Advantages .
Section::::Acquisition of British citizenship .
Holders of ILR may apply for British citizenship if they have held ILR for twelve months or longer , are over 18 and have been ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom for the last five years .
Certain ILR holders may apply for British citizenship under the registration clauses if they are qualified to do so ( e.g. , born in the UK or holding another form of British nationality ) .
Registration normally costs less than naturalisation and applicants are not required to meet knowledge and language requirements .
CHILDREN BORN IN THE UK Section::::Children born in the UK .
A child born in the United Kingdom after 1983 to persons who are not British citizens will not automatically be a British citizen .
Prior to 1 July 2006 , only a legitimate child ( born to parents who are married to each other ) could automatically derive British citizenship from the father , if the father was a British citizen or " settled " in the United Kingdom .
However , if the parents are not married when the child is born in the United Kingdom , but then get married , and the marriage legitimates the child , then if the father was a British citizen or " settled " in the UK when the child was born , the child would become a British citizen and would be regarded as having been one from the date of marriage .
This affects only children where the mother is neither a British citizen nor " settled " in the UK .
For children born on or after 1 July 2006 , an unmarried father has broadly equivalent rights ( compared with a married father ) to pass on British citizenship to a child .
Where a child would be a British citizen but for the fact that the parents are not married , the Home Office will usually register the child as a British citizen under section 3(1 ) of the British Nationality Act
provided that the child is still under 18 .
If ILR is acquired after the child 's birth , the child will not automatically be a British citizen .
However the child can be registered as a British citizen under s1(3 ) of the British Nationality Act 1981 provided application is made before the age of 18 .
Alternatively , if the child lives in the UK until age 10 , it will have a lifetime entitlement to registration as a British citizen under s1(4 ) of the Act .
Children born in the United Kingdom before 1983 are British citizens regardless of the immigration status of their parents ( unless the father was at the time of the child 's birth a diplomat accredited to the United Kingdom ) .
PUBLIC FUNDS Section::::Public funds .
Unlike people with Limited Leave to Remain ( LTR ) in the UK , ILR holders have access to public funds .
" No recourse to public funds " is not written in ILR holders ' visas .
As a result , they are able to claim job seekers ' allowances and other benefits that are usually available only to British , EU , EEA and Swiss citizens .
HOME STUDENT
STATUS Section::::Home student status .
ILR holders pay home student rates ( i.e. the same rate as British , EU , EEA and Swiss citizens ) for study at higher education institutions in the UK .
That is , they are not charged as international students , unlike LTR visa holders , if they want to study courses in any UK institutions .

OUTSIDE
THE IMMIGRATION RULES Section::::Outside the Immigration Rules .
UK Visas and Immigration has discretion to grant ILR outside the Immigration Rules either where someone qualifies under one of the immigration policy concessions or for reasons that are particularly compelling in circumstance and it is almost certain that there will be no change in circumstances within five years .
COSTS Section::::Costs .
Prior to 2003 , Indefinite Leave to Remain in the UK was free .
However , since 2003 , fees have been introduced and have risen each year in April .
ILR Fees were introduced at £ 155 in 2003 .
Following record immigration in 2004–05 , mainly from Eastern Europe , for the main applicant the fee was raised in 2005 to £ 335 , in 2007 to £ 750 , and in 2009 to £ 820 .
In 2009 the Government introduced a £ 70 m Migrants Impact Fund .
Economic migrants and students coming to the UK from outside the EU are charged a £ 50.00 levy in addition to their normal visa application fee .
The fund is used to support the communities in which they live .
A fee was also introduced for dependent applicants , at £ 50.00 each .
In 2009 Premium Applications with an in - person appointment at a regional office were introduced at a cost to the applicant of £ 1020 .
In 2010/11
the application fee was raised to £ 840 ( £ 1095 premium ) including the Migrants Impact Levy .
The dependents fee was also increased to £ 129.00 each .
In August 2010 , the new government scrapped the Migrants Impact Fund .
However , the levy is still charged ; the extra income " will now contribute to the cost of the visa and will mitigate increases that the Government would otherwise have had to make . "
On 6 April 2011 , the application fee was raised to £ 972 ( £ 1,350 premium ) including the Migrants Impact Levy .
The dependents fee was also increased to £ 486 ( £ 675 premium ) each .
From 6 April 2012 , the application fee was raised to £ 991 ( £ 1,377 premium ) including the Migrants Impact Levy .
The dependents fee was also increased to £ 496 ( £ 689 premium ) each .
From 6 April 2015 , the application fee was raised to £ 1,500 ( £ 1,900 premium ) .

CITIZENS OF EEA MEMBER STATES
Section::::Citizens of EEA member states .
Citizens of countries in the European Economic Area ( other than British and Irish citizens ) and Swiss citizens obtain permanent residence status automatically after five years ' residence in the United Kingdom exercising Treaty rights rather than ILR .
The rights of EEA citizens are not governed by UK Immigration Regulations , but rather the EEA Regulations .
Therefore , all EEA citizens ' permanent residence status will cease on 30 March 2019 following UK 's withdrawal from the EU .
Under the law as it existed between 2 October 2000 and 29 April 2006 , a citizen of an EEA state or Switzerland could be granted permanent residence on an application after four years ' residence in the United Kingdom exercising Treaty rights ( five years from 3 April 2006 ) .
Prior to 2 October 2000 , citizens of EEA states were deemed to be permanent residents immediately upon taking up residence in the UK to exercise Treaty rights .
The change in the law in 2000 was retroactive .
Hence , for example , a French citizen who arrived to work in the UK on 1 July 1986 would have been treated as a permanent resident between that date and 1 October 2000 .
From 2 October 2000 , the status would revert to that of a temporary resident if an application for ILR was not made .
On 30 April 2006 , with five years ' residence exercising Treaty rights accrued , that person regained permanent resident status .
POST - BREXIT STATUS CHANGES Section::::Post - Brexit status changes .
In 2018 , the UK government has indicated that a new immigration status would be created for EU , EEA and Swiss citizens with settled status due to the fact that their permanent residence status will lapse following Brexit .
The new scheme was unveiled in October 2018 while full operation of the scheme will only start when the UK leaves the EU on 30 March 2019 .
On 1 November 2018 , the Home Office launched a limited pilot of the scheme for certain persons working in higher education , health care or social care sectors and having access to an Android device .
Irish citizens will continue to benefit from the freedom of movement and will not be affected by Brexit due to the fact that the Common Travel Area agreement were signed before the UK 's European Community membership and hence can not be affected by UK 's withdrawal from EU regulations .
IMMIGRATION
RULE CHANGES
HC 1016 Section::::Immigration rule changes .
Section::::HC 1016 .
With effect from 3 April 2006 , the period of time required to obtain Indefinite Leave to Remain increases to five years .
These changes were debated in House of Commons Standing Committee on 20 June 2006 .
All Labour MPs voted for preserving the retroactive aspect of the changes , while all other MPs voted that the Government should bring in transitional arrangements to allow those already in the UK before the rule change to qualify under the previous four - year rule .
These changes were protested in demonstrations and rallies in London on 16 June and 23 July 2006 .
The changes were retroactive in the sense that people on a four - year visas must apply for a one - year extension before they can apply for ILR , but they did not affect people who had already been granted ILR after four years .
HC
398 Section::::HC 398 .
As from 2 April 2007 , a new condition has been added that " the applicant has sufficient knowledge of the English language and sufficient knowledge about life in the United Kingdom , unless he is under the age of 18 or aged 65 or over at the time he makes his application . "
There are two ways the applicant can meet this condition : * by passing a test called the " Life in the UK Test " .
The test is taken on a computer at one of the 100 or so Life in the UK Test centres in the UK .
It consists of 24 questions based on the information contained in the handbook " Life in the United Kingdom : A Journey to Citizenship " ( 2nd Edition ) and requires a language ability the equivalent of ESOL Entry 3 .
* by attending an English for Speakers of Other Languages ( ESOL ) course which includes citizenship materials , and progressing from one ESOL level to the next .
It is stated that on average students require between 200 and 450 hours of tuition for each ESOL level .
HC 194 Section::::HC 194 .
On 9 July 2012 , the 14-year rule ( paragraph 276B(i)(b ) ) ( which provided a route to settlement on the grounds of long residence , lawful or unlawful ) was withdrawn .
Instead , the new Immigration Rules provided that at least 20 years ' continuous residence , lawful or unlawful , would , subject to criminality and other criteria , normally be necessary to establish a claim to remain in the UK on the basis of the Article 8 right to respect for private life .
( The 10-year rule ( paragraph 276B(i)(a ) ) , which provides a route to settlement on the grounds of continuous lawful residence in the UK of at least 10 years , was unaffected and remains in place ) .
ILR may also be curtailed by the Home Secretary for reasons of national security or if the holder of the ILR commits an offence that could lead to their deportation from the United Kingdom .
A person may also lose ILR by leaving the United Kingdom for more than two years .
However , in some circumstances , such a person may reapply for indefinite leave to enter the UK .
British Overseas citizens , British subjects and British protected persons do not lose ILR no matter how long they stay outside the UK .
