DANCING WITH THE STARS ( U.S. SEASON 18 )
Season eighteen of Dancing with the Stars premiered on March 17 , 2014 .
Len Goodman , Carrie Ann Inaba and Bruno Tonioli returned as judges ; Tom Bergeron returned as host while Erin Andrews replaced Brooke Burke - Charvet as co - host .
Bandleader Ray Chew replaced the Harold Wheeler orchestra and singers .
In addition , the skybox made a return to the show and the judges table returned to the left side of the ballroom .
This season was also first to feature a new twist called " The Switch Up " , which gave viewers the opportunity to vote and change up celebrity / professional pairings for a week during the season .
Each celebrity was required to leave his or her assigned partner and perform with a new pro for one week .
This season is notable for being the first in which a dance that has been featured in every season , the paso doble , was only performed once ( by Charlie White and Sharna Burgess ) .
On May 20 , 2014 , Meryl Davis and her partner Maksim Chmerkovskiy were crowned the champions , marking the first time that Chmerkovskiy has won .
Amy Purdy and Derek Hough were the runners - up , and Candace Cameron Bure and Mark Ballas finished in third place .
COUPLES Section::::Couples .
The cast of twelve and their professional partners were revealed on March 4 , 2014 , on Good Morning America .
Nine of the twelve professional dancers from the previous season returned for season 18 .
A tenth , Sasha Farber , returned to the Dance Troupe while Tristan MacManus and Tyne Stecklein did not return in either capacity .
These three were replaced by former Troupe members — Witney Carson and Henry Byalikov — and also by Maksim Chmerkovskiy , who had returned following a two - season hiatus .
Joining Sasha Farber and Lindsay Arnold in the Troupe is Jenna Johnson from season ten of
So You Think You Can Dance and Artem Chigvintsev , a professional on the British version SCORING CHARTS
