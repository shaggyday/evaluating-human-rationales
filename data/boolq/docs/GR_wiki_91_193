BMW 1 SERIES
The BMW 1 Series is a range of subcompact executive cars ( C - segment ) manufactured by BMW since 2004 .
It is the successor to the BMW 3 Series Compact and is currently in its second generation .
The first generation was produced in hatchback , coupe and convertible body styles .
Since the second generation ( introduced in 2013 ) , the coupé and convertible models have been marketed as the 2 Series , therefore the 1 Series range no longer includes these body styles .
A sedan model became available for the Chinese market in 2017 .
The 1 Series is BMW 's entry level of model range .
Unusually for a small car , the 1 Series range is mostly rear - wheel drive , ( except for the F52 sedan , which is front - wheel drive ) with optional all - wheel drive being available on some models .
An M version was produced for the first generation : the BMW 1 Series M Coupe , which was succeeded by the BMW M2 .
