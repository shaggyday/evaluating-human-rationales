A teaser trailer calling the series
The Lizzie Borden Chronicles aired on December 8 , 2014 , during the second part of The Red Tent miniseries , promoting a 2015 premiere .
It featured the tagline , " Lizzie Borden Has an Axe to Grind " .
The Hollywood Reporter wrote in October 2014 that the series would consist of six one - hour episodes , but by January 2015 the order was increased to eight .
The Lizzie Borden Chronicles premiered on April 5 , 2015 .
Most - if not all - of the series was shot in Nova Scotia , Canada , using period buildings and interiors in Halifax and other nearby communities .
Lifetime executive vice president and general manager Rob Sharenow said in 2014 , " This series will take viewers further down Lizzie Borden 's dark path , revealing what many people suspected about her mysterious life . "
Entertainment Weekly reported that " while the film was inspired by real - life events , the series will take certain creative liberties , which draw from the mysterious events surrounding the deaths of those close to Borden in the years after her acquittal . "
Ricci said in January 2015 , " It 's an imagining of what could 've happened ...
There are no limits of behavior .
There are no rules .
It 's the ultimate playing a fantasy . "
Director Kay added , " It 's what would happen if you let this woman loose on a community . "
Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times noted that " the show mixes tidbits of actual history — there really was a Charlie Siringo , for instance — with lots of fiction and speculation , so do n't take anything here seriously " .
In June 2015 , Lifetime opted to not produce further episodes .
The complete series was released on DVD by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on February 2 , 2016 .
RECEPTION Section::::Reception .
The series has garnered mixed reviews despite high praise for Ricci 's performance as Borden .
Jane Borden of Vanity Fair called the series " playful , wicked brain candy " , adding that " Ricci was born to play an 19th - century ax murderer , as it turns out . "
Keith Uhlich of The Hollywood Reporter wrote , " Christina Ricci brings us the axe !
Would that her effort was worth it " and
Deborah Day of TheWrap noted , " Christina Ricci kills it , but even her brand of crazy is not enough . "
Praising Ricci 's Lizzie as " gleeful and ruthless " , The New York Times called the series " period - piece television served with a wink " .
