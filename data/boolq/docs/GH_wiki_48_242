CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IN FLORIDA Capital punishment is a legal penalty in the U.S. state of Florida .
Since 1976 , the state has executed 97 convicted murderers , all at Florida State Prison .
As of December 14 , 2018 , 344 offenders are awaiting execution .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Florida performed its last pre - Furman execution in 1964 ( Sie Dawson ) .
After the Supreme Court of the United States struck down all states ' death penalty procedures in the Furman v. Georgia ruling , essentially ruling the imposition of the death penalty at the same time as a guilty verdict unconstitutional , Florida was the first state to draft a newly written statute on August 12 , 1972 .
Florida performed the first involuntary execution after the Supreme Court , in the 1976 case Gregg v. Georgia , permitted the death penalty once more .
John Arthur Spenkelink was electrocuted on May 25 , 1979 .
On January 24th , 1989 , it executed notorious serial killer Ted Bundy .
The method of execution switched to lethal injection after the controversial electrocution of Allen Lee Davis in 1999 .

No one is on death row in the United States for drug trafficking .
LEGAL PROCESS Section::::Legal process .
On June 14 , 2013 , Governor Rick Scott signed the Timely Justice Act of 2013 .
The law is designed to overhaul and speed up the process of capital punishment .
It creates tighter time frames for a person sentenced to death to make appeals and post - conviction motions and imposes reporting requirements on case progress .
In Hurst v. Florida ( January 2016 ) , the United States Supreme Court struck down part of Florida 's death penalty law , saying it was not sufficient for a judge to determine the aggravating facts to be used in considering a death sentence .
Under Florida law , the jury made a recommendation to the judge , with a finding by majority vote , and the judge separately determined aggravating facts other than what the jury proposed .
The Court ruled that Florida 's law violated the Sixth Amendment guaranteeing a jury trial .
It was unclear whether the ruling would apply retroactively to current condemned men .
The Florida legislature passed a new statute to comply with the judgement in March 2016 , and it also changed the sentencing method , requiring a 10 jurors supermajority to issue a sentence of death .
If fewer than 10 jurors vote in favor of the death sentence , life imprisonment is imposed ( there is no hung jury nor retrial ) .
Previously , the judge decided the sentence alone , and the jury gave only a non - binding advice .
This new sentencing scheme was also struck down , however , the Florida Supreme Court ruling 5 - 2 in October 2016 that a death sentence must be issued by a unanimous jury .
In March 2017 , the Florida legislature passed a new statute complying with the state supreme court holding that death sentences must be unanimous .
It also provides that in case of a hung jury during the penalty phase of the trial , a life sentence is issued , even if a single juror opposed death ( there is no retrial ) .
EXECUTIONS Section::::Executions .
Florida used public hanging under a local jurisdiction , overseen and performed by the sheriffs of the counties where the crimes took place .
However , in 1923 , the Florida Legislature passed a law replacing hanging with the electric chair and stated that all future execution will be performed under state jurisdiction inside prisons .
The electric chair became a subject of strong controversy in the 1990s after three executions received considerable media attention and were labeled as " botched " by opponents ( Jesse Tafero in 1990 , Pedro Medina in 1997 , and Allen Lee Davis in 1999 ) .
While most states switched to the lethal injection , many politicians in Florida opposed giving up " Old Sparky " , seeing it as a " deterrent " .
Finally , after the Davis execution , lethal injection was enabled and became the default method .
Inmates , however , may still choose electrocution ..
In January 2016 , Wayne Doty asked the state to carry out his death sentence by electric chair , becoming the first inmate to do so since electrocution became optional .
Today , the only execution chamber in Florida is located at Florida State Prison in Starke .
When sentenced , male convicts who receive the death penalty are incarcerated at either Florida State Prison itself , or at Union Correctional Institution next door to Florida State Prison , while female convicts who are sentenced to death are incarcerated at Lowell Correctional Institution north of Ocala .
Inmates are moved to the death row at Florida State Prison when their death warrant is signed .
CLEMENCY Section::::Clemency .
The Governor of Florida has the right to commute the death penalty , but only with positive recommendation of clemency from a Board , where he or she sits .
Between 1925 and 1965 , 57 commutations were granted out of 268 cases .
Since 1972 , when the death penalty was re - instituted , only six commutations have been granted , all under the administration of Governor Bob Graham .
