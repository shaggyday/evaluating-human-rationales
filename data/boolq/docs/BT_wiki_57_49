THE GREAT MOVIE RIDE
The Great Movie Ride was a backlot tour style dark ride located at Disney 's Hollywood Studios at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake , Florida .
The attraction employed the use of Audio - Animatronic figures , practical sets , live actors , special effects , and projections to recreate iconic scenes from twelve classic films throughout motion picture history .
The attraction — which debuted with the park on May 1 , 1989—was located inside the park 's replica of Grauman 's Chinese Theatre , one of Hollywood 's most famous movie palaces .
The Great Movie Ride was originally developed by Walt Disney Imagineering as a pavilion for the Future World section of Epcot .
Under the direction of Michael Eisner and Marty Sklar , the concept was expanded into a third theme park that included the dark ride as its centerpiece .
To accurately represent a broad spectrum of cinema , Disney incorporated films from outside of its own library , mainly through its licensing agreement with MGM .
Turner Classic Movies began sponsoring the attraction in 2015 , with TCM film historian Robert Osborne being introduced as the attraction 's host .
The Great Movie Ride closed on August 13 , 2017 , becoming the last operating attraction from the park 's opening day to close .
The attraction is slated to be replaced by Mickey & Minnie 's Runaway Railway .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The Great Movie Ride directly inspired the creation of Disney 's Hollywood Studios .
In a Walt Disney Imagineering book , it was revealed that The Great Movie Ride was actually going to be the main attraction in a show business themed pavilion at Epcot , which was to be called " Great Moments at the Movies " .
However , the newly assigned Disney CEO Michael Eisner and WDI president Marty Sklar decided the idea was strong enough to lead an entire new theme park .
The idea for the ride was expanded , and the Disney - MGM Studios went into official development .
The attraction used the likenesses of numerous living and deceased actors to be recreated as audio - animatronics .
Plans called for The Great Movie Ride to be the main attraction for the Disney - MGM Studios Europe theme park , which was scrapped due to the early financial difficulties of the Euro Disneyland Resort .
Years later when the resort began turning profits , a show business themed theme park went into development again , and the Walt Disney Studios Park opened in 2002 at the Disneyland Resort Paris , although minus The Great Movie Ride .
A show called CinéMagique was built in lieu of the ride due to claims by Disney management that the French preferred shows to ride - through attractions .
Three separate attempts were made by Walt Disney Imagineering to bring The Great Movie Ride to California .
First were plans to incorporate the attraction into the proposed " Disney - MGM Studio Backlot " project , a film studio themed retail and entertainment district that was planned ( but ultimately never built ) for downtown Burbank , California during the late 1980s .
Several years later , plans called for the ride to serve as the centerpiece of the proposed Hollywoodland at Disneyland , which would have been added to the park during the planned Disney Decade in the 1990s .
Due to budget cuts , however , Hollywoodland was canceled .
Later , plans called for the ride to be built as part of the Hollywood Pictures Backlot area of the Disney California Adventure Park theme park at the Disneyland Resort .
But budget cuts in the park 's original development planning forced the ride 's projected cost to be spent on smaller , original and less expensive attractions .
In the late 1980s and early 1990s , Disney was interested in purchasing Jim Henson 's Muppets .
Walt Disney Imagineering developed a Muppet - themed land for Disney - MGM Studios called Muppet Movieland .
The land was to feature two main attractions ; one was
Muppet*Vision 3D and the other was The Great Muppet Movie Ride , a parody of The Great Movie Ride featuring Muppet characters such as Kermit the Frog , Miss Piggy , Fozzie Bear , and Gonzo re - enacting scenes from famous films such as Frankenstein and Peter Pan .
However , after Henson died , the deal fell apart and Disney cut back on the Muppet - themed area to just Muppet*Vision 3D. On the park 's opening day , Mickey Mouse , Donald Duck , Minnie Mouse , Goofy , Roger Rabbit and other Disney characters placed their signatures , footprints , and handprints in front of the façade of the Great Movie Ride .
Unlike many Disney dark rides that feature separate embarkation and debarkation areas , the Great Movie Ride had only a single combined unloading and loading area .
The last people to exit the vehicles often passed the next group of guests waiting to board the vehicles .
At the time the ride was designed ( the mid to late 1980s ) , it was common throughout the theme park industry to have all major rides exit into a store selling merchandise associated with the attraction .
The Great Movie Ride , however , did not exit directly into a store and instead allowed guests to directly exit back outside into the park .
In 2014 , as part of an exclusive programming deal with Disney , Turner Classic Movies agreed to become the sponsor of the attraction .
The attraction underwent a refurbishment in 2015 , with the addition of a new pre - show and post - show hosted by Robert Osborne , who also provided onboard narration to the ride .
The changes were unveiled on May 29 , 2015 .
On July 15 , 2017 , it was announced that the attraction would be closing on August 13 , 2017 to make way for Mickey & Minnie 's Runaway Railway .
MODIFICATIONS FOOTLIGHT PARADE Section::::Modifications .
Section::::Footlight Parade .
The first sequence of the ride , Footlight Parade , was plagued with engineering and technical problems from the beginning .
When the ride was newly opened , the Footlight Parade segment was different than what it later became .
The entire portion following the neon lighted entrance was fleshed out .
All the walls leading up to , around , and beyond the " cake " were painted in art deco style patterns as seen in " By A Waterfall " .
Approximately three " diving boards " with three mannequin " dancers " wearing capes were perched on the right - hand side of the wall as you enter the ride segment .
The five - tiered " cake " was prominently displayed at a left - hand turn .
It was in the open air illuminated with an array of animated lights .
During this pass through the Footlight Parade segment , riders would hear a " loop " of "
By A Waterfall "
( a song featured in Footlight Parade )
lasting approximately 40 seconds as bubbles fall from the ceiling .
For approximately the first year , the " cake " actually rotated and was adorned with water jets as seen in the film .
Allegedly , the rotating " cake " mechanism was constantly breaking down , causing frequent repairs and downtime .
In addition , the water pumps would constantly fail , flooding the ride path .
Park operations believed it was much cheaper and less problematic to leave the " cake " in place with lighting effects used to provide what Imagineers term as " kinetics " to the segment .
When it closed , this segment was still the " opening act " of The Great Movie Ride , but significantly toned down .
The guests entered a segment with its lighting significantly diminished .
The outer walls were dark with practically no art deco recreations from the film set .
The " diving boards " had been replaced with art deco style wall sconces .
Instead , guests passed through a deco inspired archway to find themselves facing a large scrim - lined proscenium decorated with gray / blue clouds and remnants of the art deco set designs .
Throughout the segment , three large rotating projections of Busby Berkeley - style kaleidoscope dance sequences appeared on the scrim ( from By A Waterfall , Dames , and Shadow Waltz ) .
These disappeared to expose the " cake , " which was behind the scrim and was simultaneously illuminated with washes of light and reflective water effects .
The caped dancers on diving boards were located to the far left of the " cake " behind the scrim .
The art deco style wall panels still resided behind the " cake " .
The looping song segment and bubbles remained .
THE WIZARD OF OZ Section::::The Wizard of Oz .
The Wizard of Oz scene did not have major structural changes , but Walt Disney Imagineering replaced the original A-100 Wicked Witch audio - animatronic character with a newer - design figure utilizing Sarcos technology .
The Sarcos - equipped audio - animatronics are capable of a great deal more movement possibilities than the original " limited animation " figure designs and can move much more quickly .
As a result , they were made much more lifelike .
The new witch was reprogrammed to take advantage of the underlying robot , and as a result was one of , if not the , most lifelike audio - animatronic characters in the attraction .
ATTRACTION FACADE Section::::Attraction .
Section::::Facade .
The ride was located inside a recreation of the famous Hollywood landmark , Grauman 's Chinese Theatre .
At the time the attraction opened , the actual theater 's name was " Grauman 's Chinese Theatre " and later " Mann 's Chinese Theatre " , however , the park 's proper name for this version of the building is simply " The Chinese Theater " .
From 2001 to 2015 , the theatre façade was obscured from view ( when looking from the park 's entrance ) , when the Sorcerer 's Hat was situated directly in front of the attraction .
The Chinese Theatre facade remained after the attraction 's closure .
QUEUE Section::::Queue .
The line wound through a recreation of the Chinese Theatre lobby past glass display cases containing actual costumes , props , and set pieces from various films .
The lobby also featured digital posters of various motion pictures .
The line then took guests into a small pre - show theatre where Turner Classic Movies host Robert Osborne provided insight and commentary about various motion pictures and film genres — such as musicals , adventure , science - fiction , westerns , romance , and gangster films — including those films that were featured within the ride .
The queue line ended at a pair of automatic doors at the front of the theatre that lead into a 1930s era
Hollywood soundstage where guests were loaded onto waiting ride vehicles .
RIDE EXPERIENCE Section::::Ride experience .
As guests reached the end of the queue , they entered a 1930s - era Hollywood sound stage where they were loaded by cast members into one of two pairs of open , theatre - style seating ride vehicles .
The ride vehicles utilized a " traveling theatre"-style automated guided vehicle ride system similar to the former Universe of Energy attraction at Epcot .
However , here the ride vehicles were much smaller in size , were grouped together in pairs of two , and featured an open cab in the first row of the front vehicle for a live tour guide to stand , provide narration , and operate the ride vehicle .
Earlier and later in the day , only the second pair of ride vehicles ( # 2B ) were used as the first pair of ride vehicles ( # 1A ) were only used during the busier times of day .
The film set within the soundstage featured a large neon theatre marquee and a cyclorama of the 1930s - era Hollywood Hills complete with the original Hollywoodland Sign .
As the ride began , " Hooray for Hollywood " played overhead as the vehicles ' tour guide welcomeed guests and introduced Osbourne , who informed them ( via onboard narration ) that they would be taken through scenes from different classic films throughout history .
The first genre of films introduced were musicals , which begins with a cake of starlets from By a Waterfall from Busby Berkeley 's Footlight Parade .
The next musical scenes included audio - animatronic figures of Don Lockwood ( Gene Kelly ) swinging from a lamp post from Singin ' in the Rain , followed by Mary Poppins ( Julie Andrews ) and Bert ( Dick Van Dyke ) singing on the rooftops of London from Mary Poppins .
The next scene was a tribute to gangster films .
The ride vehicle passed through the dark and seedy backstreets of a 1930s Chicago and past an audio - animatronic Tom Powers ( James Cagney ) in a scene from The Public Enemy .
When both pairs of ride vehicles were in use , the # 1A ride vehicle continued on to the next show scene past a green traffic light above a tunnel entrance while the # 2B ride vehicle was stopped when the traffic light changed to red .
While stopped , a live gangster named Mugsy ( Boy ) or Mugsi ( Girl ) and their audio - animatronic companions Squid and Beans showed up and got involved in a shoot - out with rival mobsters ( Brains , Legs , and Weasel ) in a car on the opposite side of the street where the ride vehicle was stopped .
During the shootout , the live gangster then chased away the tour guide and hijacked the ride vehicle .
Next , the ride vehicle entered into a tribute to the Western genre .
Here , guests encountered audio - animatronics of the Man with No Name ( Clint Eastwood ) standing outside of a saloon and Ethan Edwards ( John Wayne ) sitting atop his horse .
The # 2B ride vehicle ( which was already being driven by the gangster ) continued past a shootout between the town sheriff and an audio - animatronic bank robber named Snake .
The gangster ignored the shootout and continued on to the next scene .
However , the # 1A ride vehicle ( which was still being driven by the tour guide ) stopped in front of the town bank while a bank robbery was in progress .
Suddenly , a live bank robber named Kate Durango ( Girl ) or Kid Carson ( Boy ) appeared from inside the bank .
After getting into a shoot - out with the town sheriff and chasing the tour guide into the bank , the bandit set the town bank ablaze with TNT and hijacked the ride vehicle .
Following this scene , the remainder of the attraction was the same for both the # 1A and # 2B ride vehicles .
Next , the ride vehicle continued into a darkened corridor of a seemingly abandoned spaceship , revealing itself to be the Nostromo , the doomed vessel from Alien .
The ride vehicle passed an audio - animatronic Ellen Ripley ( Sigourney Weaver ) holding a flamethrower as she prepared to confront a creature lurking within the ship .
Guests could also hear Jones , Ripley 's pet cat , meowing in the darkness , as well as the Nostromo 's " Mother " computer warning of an imminent ship self - destruction countdown .
Hearing this , the gangster or the bandit became nervous and sped the ride vehicle through the ship , but not before the Alien appeared and attacked the guests , popping out from both the ceiling and the wall .
The ride vehicle next entered a scene set in an ancient Egyptian tomb filled with snakes .
Osborne informed guests that they were in a scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark as audio - animatronic figures of Indiana Jones ( Harrison Ford ) and Sallah ( John Rhys - Davies ) struggled to lift the Ark of the Covenant .
A second room within the temple featured a large altar in the form of the ancient Egyptian god Anubis .
Near the top of the altar , a large priceless jewel was being watched over by a cloaked temple guard .
The gangster or the bandit saw the jewel , stopped the ride vehicle , and disembarked to take it .
Before touching the jewel , the temple guard gave a warning that those who disturbed the treasure of the gods must pay with their life .
Ignoring the warning , the gangster or the bandit reached to grab the jewel .
Suddenly , a plume of fiery smoke shot from the ground engulfing the temple altar ( as the temple guard left , undressing to reveal that the temple guard was the original tour guide while doing so before reappearing from the shadows ) .
When the smoke cleared , the skeletal corpse of the Gangster or Bandit was revealed and the tour guide reboarded the ride vehicle and continued on with the show .
The next film genre introduced were horror films as the ride vehicle traveled through an ancient burial chamber full of mummies , some of which had come to life .
The ride vehicle soon left the tomb and entered the jungle from Tarzan the Ape Man .
Here , audio - animatronic figures of Tarzan ( Johnny Weissmuller ) swinging on a vine , Jane ( Maureen O'Sullivan ) sitting atop Timba the elephant , and Cheeta the chimpanzee could be seen .
The ride vehicle then moved past the final scene from Casablanca , featuring audio - animatronics of Rick Blaine ( Humphrey Bogart ) and Ilsa Lund ( Ingrid Bergman ) as they stood in front of a waiting airplane .
Next , the ride vehicle passed a film projection of Mickey Mouse in his role as the Sorcerer 's Apprentice from Walt Disney 's animated film , Fantasia .
The ride vehicle then entered into the Munchkinland scene from The Wizard of Oz , where Dorothy 's house had landed on the Wicked Witch of the East .
When both the # 1A and # 2B ride vehicles were in use , they met up here and came to a stop in the middle of the scene .
Audio - Animatronic Munchkins began to appear from various places and sang as they welcomed guests to their home .
However , a plume of smoke suddenly rose from the ground as an audio - animatronic Wicked Witch of the West ( Margaret Hamilton ) appeared and asked who was responsible for killing the Wicked Witch of the East .
The tour guide aboard the # 1A ride vehicle briefly interacted with her before she disappeared in another puff of smoke .
The Munchkins reappeared from their hiding places and began to sing again as both ride vehicles followed the Yellow Brick Road out of Munchkinland past audio - animatronic figures of Dorothy ( Judy Garland ) , Scarecrow ( Ray Bolger ) , Tin Man ( Jack Haley ) , Cowardly Lion ( Bert Lahr ) and Toto ( Terry ) standing in front of the Emerald City , and onto the ride 's grand finale .
For the grand finale , when both the # 1A and # 2B ride vehicles were in use , they both entered a dark theatre where they lined up side - by - side and came to a stop in front of a large movie screen .
There , Osbourne or the tour guide concluded the tour with a three - minute film montage of classic film moments .
At the conclusion of the film , both ride vehicles exited the theater lined up single - file again and returned to the 1930s soundstage where the ride concluded .

Studio Most of the non - Disney films represented in The Great Movie Ride were made and/or owned by Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer when the ride 's operation began .
In 1985 , Disney and MGM entered into a licensing contract that gave Disney worldwide rights to use the MGM name and logo for what would become Disney - MGM Studios ( now known as Disney 's Hollywood Studios ) , while separate contracts were used for The Wizard of Oz , Casablanca , Singin ' in the Rain , A Fistful of Dollars , The Public Enemy , Tarzan the Ape Man and Footlight Parade to give these films representation in The Great Movie Ride .
Currently , WarnerMedia owns the rights to many of the original MGM films , which are handled by Warner Bros. and Turner Entertainment .
The Great Movie Ride also included Alien , distributed by 20th Century Fox , as Disney originally acquired the licensing rights to the film for a different ride , which was ultimately cancelled , and the concept evolved into the ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter attraction .
Disney , however , retained the rights to use Alien and decided to incorporate it into the Great Movie Ride .
In addition to Fox , scenes from all major film studios were presented in the film montage with one notable exception ; there was no reference to any motion picture released by Universal Pictures , whose parent company operates the rival Universal Orlando Resort , located near Walt Disney World .
