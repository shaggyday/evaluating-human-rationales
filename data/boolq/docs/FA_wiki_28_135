IRON(III )
SULFATE Iron(III ) sulfate ( or ferric sulfate ) , is the chemical compound with the formula Fe(SO ) .
Usually yellow , it is a salt and soluble in water .
A variety of hydrates are also known .
Solutions are used in dyeing as a mordant , and as a coagulant for industrial wastes .
It is also used in pigments , and in pickling baths for aluminum and steel .
PRODUCTION Section::::Production .
Generally , ferric sulfate is used as a solution generated from iron wastes .
The actual speciation is vague but its applications do not demand high purity materials .
Iron(III )
sulfate is often generated as a solution rather than being isolated as a solid .
It is produced on a large scale by treating sulfuric acid , a hot solution of ferrous sulfate , and an oxidizing agent .
Typical oxidizing agents include chlorine , nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide .
NATURAL OCCURRENCES Section::::Natural occurrences .
Mikasaite , a mixed iron - aluminium sulfate of chemical formula ( Fe , Al)(SO ) is the name of mineralogical form of iron(III ) sulfate .
This anhydrous form occurs very rarely and is connected with coal fires .
The hydrates are more common , with coquimbite ( nonahydrate ) as probably the most often met among them .
Paracoquimbite is the other , rarely met natural nonahydrate .
Kornelite ( heptahydrate ) and quenstedtite ( decahydrate ) are rarely found .
Lausenite ( hexa- or pentahydrate ) is a doubtful species .
All the mentioned natural hydrates are unstable compounds connected with Fe - bearing primary minerals ( mainly pyrite and marcasite ) oxidation in ore beds .
In the solutions of the ore beds oxidation zones the iron(III ) sulfate is also an important oxidative agent .
