Interior scenes were shot in a warehouse on Beeches Industrial Estate , in Yate , South Gloucestershire .
The villages of Lark Rise and Candleford were both created from scratch on farms in Box and Neston Park , near Corsham in Wiltshire .
According to the BBC planning application , Hatt Farm in Box was used because of its proximity to existing cornfields and farm buildings , and Park Farm in Neston Park was chosen for its unspoilt character and attractive traditional buildings .
The outdoor filming at these locations for the first series took 25 days , spread over a 5-month period .
The country scenes , including all the comings and goings of the lord of the manor , were shot at Chavenage House north of Tetbury , Gloucestershire .
