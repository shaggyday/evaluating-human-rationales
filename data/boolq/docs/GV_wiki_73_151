LOYOLA RAMBLERS MEN 'S BASKETBALL
The Loyola Ramblers men 's basketball team represents Loyola University Chicago in Chicago , Illinois .
The Ramblers joined the Missouri Valley Conference on July 1 , 2013 , ending a 34-season tenure as charter members of the Horizon League .
In 1963 , Loyola won the 1963 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament ( then the " NCAA University Division " ) men 's basketball national championship under the leadership of All - American Jerry Harkness , defeating two - time defending champion Cincinnati 60–58 in overtime in the title game .
All five starters for the Ramblers played the entire championship game without substitution .
Surviving team members were honored on July 11 , 2013 , at the White House to commemorate the 50th anniversary of their victory .
The entire team was inducted in November of that year in the College Basketball Hall of Fame .
As of 2018 , Loyola remains the only school from the state of Illinois to win a men 's Division I basketball NCAA tournament .
Loyola 's first - round regional victory over Tennessee Tech on March 11 , 1963 , remains a record for margin of victory ( 69 points ) for any NCAA men 's basketball tournament game .
RACIAL INTEGRATION Section::::Racial integration .
The Loyola University Chicago teams of the early 1960s , coached by George Ireland , are thought to be responsible for ushering in a new era of racial equality in the sport by shattering all remaining color barriers in NCAA men 's basketball .
Beginning in 1961 , Loyola broke the longstanding gentlemen 's agreement ( not to play more than three black players at any given time ) , putting as many as four black players on the court at every game .
For the 1962–63 season , Ireland played four black Loyola starters in every game .
That season , Loyola also became the first team in NCAA Division I history to play an all - black lineup , doing so in a game against Wyoming on December 29 , 1962 .
In that season 's NCAA tournament , Loyola defeated the all - white team of then - segregated Mississippi State by a score of 61–51 , a game especially notable because the Bulldogs defied a state court order prohibiting them from playing against a school with black players .
In 1963 , Loyola shocked the nation and changed college basketball forever by starting four black players in the NCAA Championship game .
Loyola 's stunning upset of two - time defending NCAA champion Cincinnati , in overtime by a score of 60–58 , was the crowning achievement in the school 's nearly decade long struggle with racial inequality in men 's college basketball , highlighted by the tumultuous events of that year 's NCAA Tournament .
Loyola 's 1963 NCAA title was historic not only for the racial makeup of Loyola 's team , but also due to the fact that Cincinnati had started three black players , making seven of the 10 starters in the 1963 NCAA Championship game black .
