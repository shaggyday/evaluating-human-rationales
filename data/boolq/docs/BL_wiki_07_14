HISTORY Section::::History .
The first Lowe 's store , Lowe 's North Wilkesboro Hardware , was first opened in North Wilkesboro , North Carolina in 1921 by Lucius Smith Lowe ( 1879–1940 ) .
After Lowe died in 1940 , the business was inherited by his daughter Ruth , who sold the company to her brother Jim that same year .
Jim took on Carl Buchan as a partner in 1943 .
Buchan anticipated the dramatic increase in construction after World War II , and under his management , the store focused on hardware and building materials .
Before then , the product mix had also included notions , dry goods , horse tack , snuff , produce , and groceries .
The company bought a second location in Sparta , North Carolina in 1949 .
Lowe and Buchan differed on expanding the company to new areas and they split in 1952 with Buchan ( himself ) taking control of the hardware and building supply business and Lowe taking other joint ventures the two controlled ( including a car dealership ) .
Buchan became the sole owner of Lowe 's .
In 1954 , Lowe started the Lowes Foods grocery store chain .
By 1955 , Buchan quickly expanded the company by opening stores in the North Carolina cities of Asheville , Charlotte , and Durham .
More stores opened through the 1950s .
In 1961 , Buchan died of a heart attack at age 44 .
His five - man executive team , which included Robert Strickland and Leonard Herring , took the company public in 1961 .
By 1962 , Lowe 's operated 21 stores and reported annual revenues of $ 32 million .
Lowe 's began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1979 .
Lowe 's suffered in the 1980s due to market conditions and increasing competition from the new big - box store chain , The Home Depot .
For a while , Lowe 's resisted adopting the mega - store format partly because its management believed the smaller towns where Lowe 's mostly operated would not even support huge stores .
However , Lowe 's eventually had to adopt the big - box format in order to survive .
Today , most Lowe 's stores are part of the big - box variety , although some classic format stores remain in smaller markets .
Lowe 's has since grown nationally , as it was aided by the purchase of the Renton , Washington - based Eagle Hardware & Garden company in 1999 .
It is now the 2nd largest home improvement store chain in North America and has begun expanding outside the United States .
The first store outside of United States was in Hamilton , Ontario , Canada .
According to their website , Lowe 's has operated / serviced more than 2,355 locations in the United States , Canada , and Mexico alone .
On November 5 , 2018 , Lowe 's announced that it will be closing 51 under - performing stores , 20 stores in the United States and 31 in Canada under the Lowe 's and Rona names by February 2019 .
In November 2018 , Lowe 's announced that it will close all stores in Mexico in the future .

LAWSUITS Section::::Lawsuits .
Lowe 's was involved in a small cluster of class action lawsuits that revolved around the Lowe 's employee payment system .
The cases focused on a pay practice known as " variable rate overtime " .
Variable rate overtime has the effect of paying a decreasing overtime rate the more hours a person works in a week .
The suits alleged that salaried managers who worked 40 to 50 hours per week were improperly compensated for that time .
The variable rate overtime ended in the first quarter of 2006 .
The first case was filed in October 2002 by employees of the Lowe 's store in Shawnee , Kansas .
In September 2005 , the cases were certified as class action .
Lowe 's has four similar cases in New York , Indiana , Pennsylvania , and Ohio .
The lawsuits for New York , Indiana , and Kansas resulted in an out - of - court settlement on September 22 , 2006 .
The lawsuit in Pennsylvania became a class - action lawsuit in June 2004 , with 550 employees .
The case in Ohio was filed by ten former Lowe 's employees , in August 2004 .
Lowe 's faced multiple lawsuits from its Loss Prevention Managers citing that they were classified as exempt employees and therefore denied overtime pay .
The managers asserted that they were forced to work a minimum of 48 hours per week which saved Lowe 's and its investors millions of dollars every year .
Lawsuits have been settled for $ 2.95 million in California and $ 6.2 million in Texas .
In 2014 , Lowe 's faced a class action lawsuit from former and current Human Resource Managers .
Similarly to the lawsuit regarding its Loss Prevention Managers , the lawsuit stated that the HR Managers were improperly and illegally classified as exempt employees and were therefore denied overtime even though they were required to work 48-hour weeks .
