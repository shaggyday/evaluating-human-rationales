SUPER - G Super giant slalom , or super - G , is a racing discipline of alpine skiing .
Along with the faster downhill , it is regarded as a " speed " event , in contrast to the technical events giant slalom and slalom .
It debuted as an official World Cup event during the 1983 season and was added to the official schedule of the World Championships in 1987 and the Winter Olympics in 1988 .
Much like downhill , the other of the two " speed " events in alpine skiing , a super - G course consists of widely set gates that racers must pass through .
The course is set so that skiers must turn more than in downhill , though the speeds are still much higher than in giant slalom ( hence the name ) .
Each athlete only has one run to clock the best time .
In the Olympics , super - G courses are usually set on the same slopes as the downhill , but with a lower starting point .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Super - G was run as a World Cup test event during the 1982 season , with two men 's races and a women 's race that did not count in the season standings .
Approved by the International Ski Federation ( FIS ) that summer , it was first officially run at the World Cup level in December 1982 at Val - d'Isère , France ; the winner was Peter Müller of Switzerland .
The first official women 's super - G was run a month later in early January 1983 , with consecutive events at Verbier , Switzerland .
The first winner was Irene Epple of West Germany , and Cindy Nelson of the United States won the next day on a different course .
These were the only two races for women in super - G during the 1983 season ; the men had three .
The event was not universally embraced during its early years , which included a boycott by two - time defending overall champion Phil Mahre in December 1982 .
For the first three seasons , super - G results were added into the giant slalom discipline for the season standings ; it gained separate status for a crystal globe for the 1986 season with five events for both men and women ; the first champions were Markus Wasmeier and Marina Kiehl , both of West Germany .
It was added to the World Championships in 1987 , held at Crans - Montana , Switzerland .
Swiss skiers Pirmin Zurbriggen and Maria Walliser won gold medals to become the first world champions in the event .
Super - G made its Olympic debut in 1988 in Calgary , where Franck Piccard of France and Sigrid Wolf of Austria took gold at Nakiska .
TOP RACERS Section::::Top racers .
Hermann Maier of Austria ( nicknamed ' The Hermannator ' ) is widely regarded as the greatest male super - G racer , with 24 World Cup victories and five World Cup titles ( 1998–2001 , 2004 ) .
He won the world championship in 1999 and an Olympic gold medal in 1998 , three days after a crash in the downhill .
Maier 's proficiency in super - G was attributed to his thorough course inspection and his aggressive course tactics ; he opted for the most direct and dangerous line down the hill .
A serious motorcycle accident in August 2001 nearly resulted in an amputation of his lower right leg and sidelined him for the 2002 season , including the 2002 Olympics .
After his return to the World Cup circuit in January 2003 , Maier won eight more World Cup super - G events and his fifth season title in 2004 .
Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway is second on the list with 15 wins in World Cup super - G races ,
Pirmin Zurbriggen third with his 10 wins .
Svindal won Olympic gold in 2010 and his fifth season title in 2014 , while Zurbriggen won four consecutive season titles ( 1987–90 ) and the first world championship in 1987 .
Another notable specialist was Kjetil André Aamodt of Norway , a triple gold medalist in Olympic super - G races , winning in 1992 , 2002 and 2006 .
Aamodt won five World Cup races and two world championship medals ( silver and bronze ) in the discipline .
Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg , a five - time overall World Cup champion , won nine World Cup super - G events .
He won season titles in every discipline except super - G , where he was a runner - up three times .
Girardelli was the silver medalist in the super - G at the 1987 World Championships and the 1992 Olympics .
On the women 's side , Lindsey Vonn of the U.S. leads with 27 World Cup victories in super - G and has won five season titles ( 2009–2012 , 2015 ) .
Katja Seizinger of Germany won five season titles in the 1990s , with 16 World Cup wins in the discipline .
While neither won gold in the super - G in the Olympics ( both won a bronze ) , they both won a world title , Vonn in 2009 and Seizinger in 1993 .
Renate Götschl of Austria won 17 World Cup events in super - G , three season titles ( four as runner - up ) , and two medals ( silver and bronze ) in the world championships .
COURSE Section::::Course .

In the Olympic Winter Games , FIS World Ski Championships , and FIS World Cups , minimums are raised to for both men and women .
Courses are normally at least in width , but sections with lower widths are permissible if the line and terrain before and after allow it .
Higher widths can also be required if deemed necessary .
Gates must be between and in width for open gates , and between and in width for vertical gates .
The distance between turning poles of successive gates must be at least .
The number of direction changes must be at least 7 % of the course drop in meters ( 6 % for Olympic Winter Games , FIS World Ski Championships and FIS World Cups ) .
EQUIPMENT Section::::Equipment .
In an attempt to increase safety , the 2004 season saw the FIS impose minimum ski lengths for the super - G for the first time ; to for men , for women .
