STATUE OF LIBERTY FOREVER STAMP
The United States Post Office issued the Statue of Liberty Forever stamp on December 1 , 2010 .
The stamp shows the replica of the Statue of Liberty ( Liberty Enlightening the World ) located at the New York - New York Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip rather than the original Statue of Liberty in New York .
The error was not noticed until March 2011 .
The error was identified by Sunipix , a stock photo agency in Texas .
Ten and a half billion of the error stamps were produced .
The mistake is the largest run of an error on a postage stamp .
In 2013 , sculptor Robert S. Davidson sued the Postal Service for copyright infringement and in July 2018 , a judge ordered the United States Postal Service to pay Davidson $ 3.5 million .
