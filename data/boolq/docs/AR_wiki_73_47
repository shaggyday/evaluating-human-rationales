BUMBLEBEE
A bumblebee ( or bumble bee , bumble - bee or humble - bee ) is any of over 250 species in the genus Bombus , part of Apidae , one of the bee families .
This genus is the only extant group in the tribe Bombini , though a few extinct related genera ( e.g. , Calyptapis ) are known from fossils .
They are found primarily in higher altitudes or latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere , although they are also found in South America where a few lowland tropical species have been identified .
European bumblebees have also been introduced to New Zealand and Tasmania .
Female bumblebees can sting repeatedly , but generally ignore humans and other animals .
Most bumblebees are social insects that form colonies with a single queen .
The colonies are smaller than those of honey bees , growing to as few as 50 individuals in a nest .
Cuckoo bumblebees are brood parasitic and do not make nests ; their queens aggressively invade the nests of other bumblebee species , kill the resident queens and then lay their own eggs , which are cared for by the resident workers .
Cuckoo bumblebees were previously classified as a separate genus , but are now usually treated as members of Bombus .
Bumblebees have round bodies covered in soft hair ( long branched setae ) called pile , making them appear and feel fuzzy .
They have aposematic ( warning ) coloration , often consisting of contrasting bands of colour , and different species of bumblebee in a region often resemble each other in mutually protective Müllerian mimicry .
Harmless insects such as hoverflies often derive protection from resembling bumblebees , in Batesian mimicry , and may be confused with them .
Nest - making bumblebees can be distinguished from similarly large , fuzzy cuckoo bees by the form of the female hind leg .
In nesting bumblebees , it is modified to form a pollen basket , a bare shiny area surrounded by a fringe of hairs used to transport pollen , whereas in cuckoo bees , the hind leg is hairy all round , and pollen grains are wedged among the hairs for transport .
Like their relatives the honeybees , bumblebees feed on nectar , using their long hairy tongues to lap up the liquid ; the proboscis is folded under the head during flight .
Bumblebees gather nectar to add to the stores in the nest , and pollen to feed their young .
They forage using colour and spatial relationships to identify flowers to feed from .
Some bumblebees steal nectar , making a hole near the base of a flower to access the nectar while avoiding pollen transfer .
Bumblebees are important agricultural pollinators , so their decline in Europe , North America , and Asia is a cause for concern .
The decline has been caused by habitat loss , the mechanisation of agriculture , and pesticides .
ETYMOLOGY AND COMMON NAMES Section::::Etymology and common names .
The word " bumblebee " is a compound of " bumble " + " bee"—"bumble " meaning to hum , buzz , drone , or move ineptly or flounderingly .
The generic name Bombus , assigned by Pierre André Latreille in 1802 , is derived from the Latin word for a buzzing or humming sound , borrowed from Ancient Greek βόμβος ( bómbos ) .
According to the Oxford English Dictionary ( OED ) , the term " bumblebee " was first recorded as having been used in the English language in the 1530 work Lesclarcissement by John Palsgrave , " I bomme , as a bombyll bee dothe . "
However the OED also states that the term " humblebee " predates it , having first been used in 1450 in Fysshynge wyth Angle , " In Juyll the greshop & the humbylbee in the medow .
" The latter term was used in A Midsummer Night 's Dream ( circa 1600 ) by William Shakespeare , " The honie - bags steale from the humble Bees . " An old provincial name , " dumbledor " , also denoted a buzzing insect such as a bumblebee or cockchafer , " dumble " probably imitating the sound of these insects , while " dor " meant " beetle " .
In On the Origin of Species ( 1859 ) , Charles Darwin speculated about " humble - bees " and their interactions with other species :
However , " bumblebee " remained in use , for example in The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse ( 1910 ) by Beatrix Potter , " Suddenly round a corner , she met Babbitty Bumble--"Zizz , Bizz , Bizzz !
" said the bumble bee . "
Since World War II " humblebee " has fallen into near - total disuse .
PHYLOGENY Section::::Phylogeny .
The bumblebee tribe Bombini is one of four groups of corbiculate bees ( those with pollen baskets ) in the Apidae , the others being the Apini ( honeybees ) , Euglossini ( orchid bees ) , and Meliponini ( stingless bees ) .
The corbiculate bees are a monophyletic group .
Advanced eusocial behaviour appears to have evolved twice in the group , giving rise to controversy , now largely settled , as to the phylogenetic origins of the four tribes ; it had been supposed that eusocial behaviour had evolved only once , requiring the Apini to be close to the Meliponini , which they do not resemble .
It is now thought that the Apini ( with advanced societies ) and Euglossini are closely related , while the primitively eusocial Bombini are close to the Meliponini , which have somewhat more advanced eusocial behaviour .
Sophie Cardinal and Bryan Danforth comment that " While remarkable , a hypothesis of dual origins of advanced eusociality is congruent with early studies on corbiculate morphology and social behavior . "
Their analysis , combining molecular , morphological and behavioural data , gives the following cladogram :
On this hypothesis , the molecular data suggest that the Bombini are 25 to 40 million years old , while the Meliponini ( and thus the clade that includes the Bombini and Meliponini ) are 81 to 96 million years old , about the same age as the corbiculate group .
However , a more recent phylogeny using transcriptome data from 3,647 genes of ten corbiculate bee species supports the single origin of eusociality hypothesis in the corbiculate bees .
They find that Bombini is in fact sister to Meliponini , corroborating that previous finding from Sophie Cardinal and Bryan Danforth ( 2011 ) .
However , Romiguier et al .
( 2015 ) shows that Bombini , Meliponini , and Apini form a monophyletic group , where Apini shares a most recent common ancestor with the Bombini and Meliponini clade , while Euglossini is most distantly related to all three , since it does not share the same most recent common ancestor as Bombini , Meliponini , and Apini .
Thus , their analysis supports the single origin of eusociality hypothesis within the corbiculate bees , where eusociality evolved in the common ancestor of Bombini , Apini , and Meliponini .
The fossil record for bees is incomplete .
Around 11 specimens that might possibly be Bombini , some poorly documented , had been described by 2011 ; some ( such as Calyptapis florissantensis from Florissant , USA , and Oligoapis beskonakensis from , Turkey ) dated from the Oligocene .
In 2012 a fossil bumblebee , Bombus ( Bombus ) randeckensis was described from the Miocene Randeck Maar in southwestern Germany and confidently placed in the subgenus Bombus .
In 2014 , another species , Bombus cerdanyensis , was described from Late Miocene lacustrine beds of La Cerdanya , Spain , but not placed into any subgenus , while a new genus and species , Oligobombus cuspidatus was described from the late Eocene Bembridge Marls of the Isle of Wight .
The species Bombus trophonius was described in October 2017 and placed in Bombus subgenus Cullumanobombus .
TAXONOMY Section::::Taxonomy .
The genus Bombus , the only one extant genus in the tribe Bombini , comprises over 250 species ; for an overview of the differences between bumblebees and other bees and wasps , see characteristics of common wasps and bees .
The genus has been divided variously into up to 49 subgenera , a degree of complexity criticised by Williams ( 2008 ) .
The cuckoo bumblebees Psithyrus have sometimes been treated as a separate genus but are now considered to be part of Bombus , in one or more subgenera .
Examples of Bombus species include Bombus atratus , Bombus dahlbomii , Bombus fervidus , Bombus lapidarius , Bombus ruderatus , and Bombus rupestris .
GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Section::::General description .
Bumblebees vary in appearance , but are generally plump and densely furry .
They are larger , broader and stouter - bodied than honeybees , and their abdomen tip is more rounded .
Many species have broad bands of colour , the patterns helping to distinguish different species .
Whereas honeybees have short tongues and therefore mainly pollinate open flowers , some bumblebee species have long tongues and collect nectar from flowers that are closed into a tube .
Bumblebees have fewer stripes ( or none ) , and usually have part of the body covered in black fur , while honeybees have many stripes including several grey stripes on the abdomen .
Sizes are very variable even within species ; the largest British species , B. terrestris , has queens up to long , males up to long , and workers between long .
The largest bumblebee species in the world is B. dahlbomii of Chile , up to about long , and described as " flying mice " and " a monstrous fluffy ginger beast " .
DISTRIBUTION AND HABITAT Section::::Distribution and habitat .
Bumblebees are typically found in temperate climates , and are often found at higher latitudes and altitudes than other bees , although a few lowland tropical species exist .
A few species ( B. polaris and B. alpinus ) range into very cold climates where other bees might not be found ; B. polaris occurs in northern Ellesmere Island in the high Arctic , along with another bumblebee B. hyperboreus , which parasitises its nest .
This is the most northernmost occurrence of any eusocial insect .
One reason for their presence in cold places is that bumblebees can regulate their body temperature , via solar radiation , internal mechanisms of " shivering " and radiative cooling from the abdomen ( called heterothermy ) .
Other bees have similar physiology , but the mechanisms seem best developed and have been most studied in bumblebees .
They adapt to higher elevations by extending their wing stroke amplitude .
Bumblebees have a largely cosmopolitan distribution but are absent from Australia ( apart from Tasmania where they have been introduced ) and are found in Africa only north of the Sahara .
More than a hundred years ago they have also been introduced to New Zealand , where they play an important role as efficient pollinators .
BIOLOGY FEEDING Section::::Biology .
Section::::Feeding .
The bumblebee tongue ( the proboscis ) is a long , hairy structure that extends from a sheath - like modified maxilla .
The primary action of the tongue is lapping , that is , repeated dipping of the tongue into liquid .
The tip of the tongue probably acts as a suction cup and during lapping , nectar may be drawn up the proboscis by capillary action .
When at rest or flying , the proboscis is kept folded under the head .
The longer the tongue , the deeper the bumblebee can probe into a flower and bees probably learn by experience which flower source is best - suited to their tongue length .
Bees with shorter proboscides , like Bombus bifarius , have a more difficult time foraging nectar relative to other bumblebees with longer proboscides ; to overcome this disadvantage , B. bifarius workers were observed to lick the back of spurs on the nectar duct , which resulted in a small reward .
WAX PRODUCTION Section::::Wax production .
The exoskeleton of the abdomen is divided into plates called dorsal tergites and ventral sternites .
Wax is secreted from glands on the abdomen and extruded between the sternites where it resembles flakes of dandruff .
It is secreted by the queen when she starts a nest and by young workers .
It is scraped from the abdomen by the legs , moulded until malleable and used in the construction of honeypots , to cover the eggs , to line empty cocoons for use as storage containers and sometimes to cover the exterior of the nest .
COLORATION Section::::Coloration .
The brightly coloured pile of the bumblebee is an aposematic ( warning ) signal , given that females can inflict a painful sting .
Depending on the species and morph , the warning colours range from entirely black , to bright yellow , red , orange , white , and pink .
Dipteran flies in the families Syrphidae ( hoverflies ) , Asilidae ( robber flies ) , Tabanidae ( horseflies ) , Oestridae ( bot or warble flies ) and Bombyliidae ( bee flies ) all include Batesian mimics of bumblebees , resembling them closely enough to deceive at least some predators .
Many species of Bombus , including the group sometimes called Psithyrus ( cuckoo bumblebees ) , have evolved Müllerian mimicry , where the different bumblebees in a region resemble each other , so that a young predator need only learn to avoid any of them once .
For example , in California a group of bumblebees consists of largely black species including B. californicus , B. caliginosus , B. vandykei , B. vosnesenskii , B. insularis and B. fernaldae .
Other bees in California include a group of species all banded black and yellow .
In each case , Müllerian mimicry provides the bees in the group with a selective advantage .
In addition , parasitic ( cuckoo ) bumblebees resemble their hosts more closely than would be expected by chance , at least in areas like Europe where parasite - host co - speciation is common ; but this too may be explained as Müllerian mimicry , rather than requiring the parasite 's coloration to deceive the host ( aggressive mimicry ) .
TEMPERATURE CONTROL Section::::Temperature control .
Bumblebees are active in conditions when honeybees stay at home , and can readily absorb heat from even weak sunshine .
The thick pile created by long setae ( bristles ) acts as insulation to keep bumblebees warm in cold weather ; species from cold climates have longer setae ( and thus thicker insulation ) than those from the tropics .
The temperature of the flight muscles , which occupy much of the thorax , needs to be at least before flight can take place .
The muscle temperature can be raised by shivering .
It takes about five minutes for the muscles to reach this temperature at an air temperature of .
CHILL - COMA TEMPERATURE Section::::Chill - coma temperature .
The chill - coma temperature in relation to flying insects is the temperature at which flight muscles can not be activated .
Compared to honey bees and carpenter bees , bumblebees have the lowest chill - coma temperature .
Of the bumblebees Bombus bimaculatus has the lowest at .
However , bumblebees have been seen to fly in colder ambient temperatures .
This discrepancy is likely because the chill - coma temperature was determined by tests done in a laboratory setting .
However , bumblebees live in insulated shelters and can shiver to warm up before venturing into the cold .
COMMUNICATION AND SOCIAL LEARNING Section::::Communication and social learning .
Bumblebees do not have ears , and it is not known whether or how well they can hear .
However , they are sensitive to the vibrations made by sound travelling through wood or other materials .
Bumblebees do not exhibit the " bee dances " used by honeybees to tell other workers the locations of food sources .
Instead , when they return from a successful foraging expedition , they run excitedly around in the nest for several minutes before going out to forage once more .
These bees may be offering some form of communication based on the buzzing sounds made by their wings , which may stimulate other bees to start foraging .
Another stimulant to foraging activity is the level of food reserves in the colony .
Bees monitor the amount of honey in the honeypots , and when little is left or when high quality food is added , they are more likely to go out to forage .
Bumblebees have been observed to partake in social learning .
In a 2017 study involving Bombus terrestris , bees were taught to complete an unnatural task of moving large objects to obtain a reward .
Bees that first observed another bee complete the task were significantly more successful in learning the task than bees that observed the same action performed by a magnet , indicating the importance of social information .
The bees did not copy each other exactly : in fact , the study suggested that the bees were instead attempting to emulate each other 's goals .
REPRODUCTION AND NESTING Section::::Reproduction and nesting .
Nest size depends on species of bumblebee .
Most form colonies of between 50 and 400 individuals , but colonies have been documented as small as ~20 individuals and as large as 1700 .
These nests are small compared to honeybee hives , which hold about 50,000 bees .
Many species nest underground , choosing old rodent burrows or sheltered places , and avoiding places that receive direct sunlight that could result in overheating .
Other species make nests above ground , whether in thick grass or in holes in trees .
A bumblebee nest is not organised into hexagonal combs like that of a honeybee ; the cells are instead clustered together untidily .
The workers remove dead bees or larvae from the nest and deposit them outside the nest entrance , helping to prevent disease .
Nests in temperate regions last only for a single season and do not survive the winter .
In the early spring , the queen comes out of diapause and finds a suitable place to create her colony .
Then she builds wax cells in which to lay her eggs which were fertilised the previous year .
The eggs that hatch develop into female workers , and in time , the queen populates the colony , with workers feeding the young and performing other duties similar to honeybee workers .
In temperate zones , young queens ( gynes ) leave the nest in the autumn and mate , often more than once , with males ( drones ) that are forcibly driven out of the colony .
The drones and workers die as the weather turns colder ; the young queens feed intensively to build up stores of fat for the winter .
They survive in a resting state ( diapause ) , generally below ground , until the weather warms up in the spring with the early bumblebee being the species that is among the first to emerge .
Many species of bumblebee follow this general trend within the year .
Bombus pensylvanicus is a species that follows this type of colony cycle .
For this species the cycle begins in February , reproduction starts in July or August , and ends in the winter months .
The queen remains in hibernation until spring of the following year in order to optimize conditions to search for a nest .
In fertilised queens , the ovaries only become active when the queen starts to lay .
An egg passes along the oviduct to the vagina where there is a chamber called the spermatheca , in which the sperm from the mating is stored .
Depending on need , she may allow her egg to be fertilised .
Unfertilised eggs become haploid males ; fertilised eggs grow into diploid females and queens .
The hormones that stimulate the development of the ovaries are suppressed in female worker bees , while the queen remains dominant .
To develop , the larvae must be fed both nectar for carbohydrates and pollen for protein .
Bumblebees feed nectar to the larvae by chewing a small hole in the brood cell into which they regurgitate nectar .
Larvae are fed pollen in one of two ways , depending on the bumblebee species .
Pocket - making bumblebees create pockets of pollen at the base of the brood - cell clump from which the larvae feed themselves .
Pollen - storing bumblebees keep pollen in separate wax pots and feed it to the larvae .
After the emergence of the first or second group of offspring , workers take over the task of foraging and the queen spends most of her time laying eggs and caring for larvae .
The colony grows progressively larger and eventually begins to produce males and new queens .
Bumblebee workers can lay unfertilised haploid eggs ( with only a single set of chromosomes ) that develop into viable male bumblebees .
Only fertilised queens can lay diploid eggs ( one set of chromosomes from a drone , one from the queen ) that mature into workers and new queens .
In a young colony , the queen minimises reproductive competition from workers by suppressing their egg - laying through physical aggression and pheromones .
Worker policing leads to nearly all eggs laid by workers being eaten .
Thus , the queen is usually the mother of all of the first males laid .
Workers eventually begin to lay male eggs later in the season when the queen 's ability to suppress their reproduction diminishes .
Because of the reproductive competition between workers and the queen , bumblebees are considered " primitively eusocial " .
Although a large majority of bumblebees follow such monogynous colony cycles that only involve one queen , some select Bombus species ( such as Bombus atratus ) will spend part of their life cycle in a polygynous phase ( have multiple queens in one nest during these periods of polygyny ) .
FORAGING BEHAVIOUR
Section::::Foraging behaviour .
Bumblebees generally visit flowers that exhibit the bee pollination syndrome and these patches of flowers may be up to 1–2 km from their colony .
They tend to visit the same patches of flowers every day , as long as they continue to find nectar and pollen there , a habit known as pollinator or flower constancy .
While foraging , bumblebees can reach ground speeds of up to .
Bumblebees use a combination of colour and spatial relationships to learn which flowers to forage from .
They can also detect both the presence and the pattern of electric fields on flowers , which occur due to atmospheric electricity , and take a while to leak away into the ground .
They use this information to find out if a flower has been recently visited by another bee .
Bumblebees can detect the temperature of flowers , as well as which parts of the flower are hotter or cooler and use this information to recognise flowers .
After arriving at a flower , they extract nectar using their long tongues ( " glossae " ) and store it in their crops .
Many species of bumblebees also exhibit " nectar robbing " : instead of inserting the mouthparts into the flower in the normal way , these bees bite directly through the base of the corolla to extract nectar , avoiding pollen transfer .
Pollen is removed from flowers deliberately or incidentally by bumblebees .
Incidental removal occurs when bumblebees come in contact with the anthers of a flower while collecting nectar .
When it enters a flower , the bumblebee 's body hairs receive a dusting of pollen from the anthers .
In queens and workers this is then groomed into the corbiculae ( pollen baskets ) on the hind legs where it can be seen as bulging masses that may contain as many as a million pollen grains .
Male bumblebees do not have corbiculae and do not purposively collect pollen .
Bumblebees are also capable of buzz pollination , in which they dislodge pollen from the anthers by creating a resonant vibration with their flight muscles .
In at least some species , once a bumblebee has visited a flower , it leaves a scent mark on it .
This scent mark deters bumblebees from visiting that flower until the scent degrades .
This scent mark is a general chemical bouquet that bumblebees leave behind in different locations ( e.g. nest , neutral , and food sites ) , and they learn to use this bouquet to identify both rewarding and unrewarding flowers , and may be able to identify who else has visited a flower .
Bumblebees rely on this chemical bouquet more when the flower has a high handling time , that is , where it takes a longer time for the bee to find the nectar once inside the flower .
Once they have collected nectar and pollen , female workers return to the nest and deposit the harvest into brood cells , or into wax cells for storage .
Unlike honeybees , bumblebees only store a few days ' worth of food , so are much more vulnerable to food shortages .
Male bumblebees collect only nectar and do so to feed themselves .
They may visit quite different flowers from the workers because of their different nutritional needs .
ASYNCHRONOUS FLIGHT MUSCLES Section::::Asynchronous flight muscles .
Bees beat their wings about 200 times a second .
Their thorax muscles do not contract on each nerve firing , but rather vibrate like a plucked rubber band .
This is efficient , since it lets the system consisting of muscle and wing operate at its resonant frequency , leading to low energy consumption .
Further , it is necessary , since insect motor nerves generally can not fire 200 times per second .
These types of muscles are called asynchronous muscles and are found in the insect wing systems in families such as Hymenoptera , Diptera , Coleoptera , and Hemiptera .
Bumblebees must warm up their bodies considerably to get airborne at low ambient temperatures .
Bumblebees can reach an internal thoracic temperature of 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) using this method .
CUCKOO BUMBLEBEES Section::::Cuckoo bumblebees .
Bumblebees of the subgenus Psithyrus ( known as ' cuckoo bumblebees ' , and formerly considered a separate genus ) are brood parasites , sometimes called kleptoparasites , in the colonies of other bumblebees , and have lost the ability to collect pollen .
Before finding and invading a host colony , a Psithyrus female , such as that of the Psithyrus species of B. sylvestris , feeds directly from flowers .
Once she has infiltrated a host colony , the Psithyrus female kills or subdues the queen of that colony , and uses pheromones and physical attacks to force the workers of that colony to feed her and her young .
Usually , cuckoo bumblebees can be described as queen - intolerant inquilines , since the host queen is often killed to enable the parasite to produce more offspring , though some species , such as B. bohemicus , actually enjoy increased success when they leave the host queen alive .
The female Psithyrus has a number of morphological adaptations for combat , such as larger mandibles , a tough cuticle and a larger venom sac that increase her chances of taking over a nest .
Upon emerging from their cocoons , the Psithyrus males and females disperse and mate .
The males do not survive the winter but , like nonparasitic bumblebee queens , Psithyrus females find suitable locations to spend the winter and enter diapause after mating .
They usually emerge from hibernation later than their host species .
Each species of cuckoo bee has a specific host species , which it may physically resemble .
In the case of the parasitism of B. terrestris by B. ( Psithyrus ) vestalis , genetic analysis of individuals captured in the wild showed that about 42 % of the host species ' nests at a single location had " [ lost ] their fight against their parasite " .
STING Section::::Sting .
Queen and worker bumblebees can sting .
Unlike in honeybees , a bumblebee 's sting lacks barbs , so the bee can sting repeatedly without injuring itself ; by the same token , the sting is not left in the wound .
Bumblebee species are not normally aggressive , but may sting in defence of their nest , or if harmed .
Female cuckoo bumblebees aggressively attack host colony members , and sting the host queen , but ignore other animals unless disturbed .
PREDATORS , PARASITES AND PATHOGENS Section::::Predators , parasites and pathogens .
Bumblebees , despite their ability to sting , are eaten by certain predators .
Nests may be dug up by badgers and eaten whole , including any adults present .
Adults are preyed upon by robber flies and beewolves in North America .
In Europe , birds including bee - eaters and shrikes capture adult bumblebees on the wing ; smaller birds such as great tits also occasionally learn to take bumblebees , while camouflaged crab spiders catch them as they visit flowers .
The great grey shrike is able to detect flying bumblebees up to 100 metres away ; once captured , the sting is removed by repeatedly squeezing the insect with the mandibles and wiping the abdomen on a branch .
The European honey buzzard follows flying bees back to their nest , digs out the nest with its feet , and eats larvae , pupae and adults as it finds them .
Bumblebees are parasitised by tracheal mites ,
Locustacarus buchneri ; protozoans including Crithidia bombi and Apicystis bombi ; and microsporidians including Nosema bombi and Nosema ceranae .
The tree bumblebee B. hypnorum has spread into the United Kingdom despite hosting high levels of a nematode that normally interferes with queen bees ' attempts to establish colonies .
Deformed wing virus has been found to affect 11 % of bumblebees in Great Britain .
Female Bee Moths ( Aphomia sociella ) prefer to lay their eggs in bumblebee nests .
The A. sociella larvae will then feed on the eggs , larvae , and pupae left unprotected by the bumble bees , sometimes destroying large parts of the nest .
RELATIONSHIP TO HUMANS AGRICULTURAL USE Section::::Relationship to humans .
Section::::Agricultural use .
Bumblebees are important pollinators of both crops and wildflowers .
Because bumblebees do not overwinter the entire colony , they do not stockpile honey , and therefore are not useful as honey producers .
Bumblebees are increasingly cultured for agricultural use as pollinators , among other reasons because they can pollinate plants such as tomato in greenhouses by buzz pollination whereas other pollinators can not .
Commercial production began in 1987 , when Roland De Jonghe founded the Biobest company ; in 1988 they produced enough nests to pollinate 40 hectares of tomatoes .
The industry grew quickly , starting with other companies in the Netherlands .
Bumblebee nests , mainly of buff - tailed bumblebees , are produced in at least 30 factories around the world ; over a million nests are grown annually in Europe ; Turkey is a major producer .
Bumblebees are Northern Hemisphere animals .
When red clover was introduced as a crop to New Zealand in the nineteenth century , it was found to have no local pollinators , and clover seed had accordingly to be imported each year .
Four species of bumblebee from the United Kingdom were therefore imported as pollinators .
In 1885 and 1886 the Canterbury Acclimatization Society brought in 442 queens , of which 93 survived and quickly multiplied .
As planned , red clover was soon being produced from locally - grown seed .
Bumblebees are also reared commercially to pollinate tomatoes grown in greenhouses .
The New Zealand population of buff - tailed bumblebees naturally colonised Tasmania , 1,500 miles away , in 1992 .
Some concerns exist about the impact of the international trade in mass - produced bumblebee colonies .
Evidence from Japan and South America indicates bumblebees can escape and naturalise in new environments , causing damage to native pollinators .
Greater use of native pollinators , such as Bombus ignitus in China and Japan , has occurred as a result .
In addition , mounting evidence indicates mass - produced bumblebees may also carry diseases , harmful to wild bumblebees and honeybees .
In Canada and Sweden it has been shown that growing a mosaic of different crops encourages bumblebees and provides higher yields than does a monoculture of oilseed rape , despite the fact that the bees were attracted to the crop .
POPULATION DECLINE Section::::Population decline .
Bumblebee species are declining in Europe , North America , and Asia due to a number of factors , including land - use change that reduces their food plants .
In North America , pathogens are possibly having a stronger negative effect especially for the subgenus Bombus .
A major impact on bumblebees was caused by the mechanisation of agriculture , accelerated by the urgent need to increase food production during the Second World War .
Small farms depended on horses to pull implements and carts .
The horses were fed on clover and hay , both of which were permanently grown on a typical farm .
Little artificial fertiliser was used .
Farms thus provided flowering clover and flower - rich meadows , favouring bumblebees .
Mechanisation removed the need for horses and most of the clover ; artificial fertilisers encouraged the growth of taller grasses , outcompeting the meadow flowers .
Most of the flowers , and the bumblebees that fed on them , disappeared from Britain by the early 1980s .
The last native British short - haired bumblebee was captured near Dungeness in 1988 .
This significant increase in pesticide and fertilizer use associated with the industrialization of agriculture has had adverse effects on the genus Bombus .
The bees are directly exposed to the chemicals in two ways : by consuming nectar that has been directly treated with pesticide , or through physical contact with treated plants and flowers .
The species Bombus hortorum in particular has been found to be impacted by the pesticides ; their brood development has been reduced and their memory has been negatively affected .
Additionally , pesticide use negatively impacts colony development and size .
Bumblebees are in danger in many developed countries due to habitat destruction and collateral pesticide damage .
The European Food Safety Authority ruled that three neonicotinoid pesticides ( clothianidin , imidacloprid , and thiamethoxam ) presented a high risk for bees .
While most work on neonicotinoid toxicity has looked at honeybees , a study on B. terrestris showed that " field - realistic " levels of imidacloprid significantly reduced growth rate and cut production of new queens by 85 % , implying a " considerable negative effect " on wild bumblebee populations throughout the developed world .
However , in another study , following chronic exposure to field - realistic levels of the neonicotinoid pesticide thiamethoxam , colony weight gain was not affected , nor were the number or mass of sexuals produced .
Low levels of neonicotinoids can reduce the number of bumblebees in a colony by as much as 55 % , and cause dysfunction in the bumblebees ' brains .
The Bumblebee Conservation Trust considers this evidence of reduced brain function " particularly alarming given that bumblebees rely upon their intelligence to go about their daily tasks .
"
A study on B. terrestris had results that suggests that use of neonicotinoid pesticides can affect how well bumblebees are able to forage and pollinate .
Bee colonies that had been affected by the pesticide released more foragers and collected more pollen than bees who had not been dosed with neonicotinoid .
Although the bees affected by the pesticide were able to collect more pollen , they took a longer amount of time doing so .
Of 19 species of native nestmaking bumblebees and six species of cuckoo bumblebees formerly widespread in Britain , three have been extirpated , eight are in serious decline , and only six remain widespread .
Similar declines have been reported in Ireland , with four species designated endangered , and another two considered vulnerable to extinction .
A decline in bumblebee numbers could cause large - scale changes to the countryside , resulting from inadequate pollination of certain plants .
Some bumblebees native to North America are also vanishing , such as Bombus balteatus , Bombus terricola , Bombus affinis , and Bombus occidentalis , and one , Bombus franklini , may be extinct .
In South America , Bombus bellicosus was extirpated in the northern limit of its distribution range , probably due to intense land use and climate change effects .
CONSERVATION EFFORTS Section::::Conservation efforts .
In 2006 the bumblebee researcher Dave Goulson founded a registered charity , the Bumblebee Conservation Trust , to prevent the extinction " of any of the UK 's bumblebees . "
In 2009 and 2010 , the Trust attempted to reintroduce the short - haired bumblebee , Bombus subterraneus , which had become extinct in Britain , from the British - derived populations surviving in New Zealand from their introduction there a century earlier .
From 2011 the Trust , in partnership with Natural England , Hymettus and the RSPB , has reintroduced short - haired bumblebee queens from Skåne in southern Sweden to restored flower - rich meadows at Dungeness in Kent .
The queens were checked for mites and American foulbrood disease .
Agri - environment schemes spread across the neighbouring area of Romney Marsh have been set up to provide over 800 hectares of additional flower - rich habitat for the bees .
By the summer of 2013 , workers of the species were found near the release zone , proving that nests had been established .
The restored habitat has produced a revival in at least five " Schedule 41 priority " species : the ruderal bumblebee , Bombus ruderatus ; the red - shanked carder bee , Bombus ruderarius ; the shrill carder bee , Bombus sylvarum ; the brown - banded carder bee , Bombus humilis and the moss carder bee , Bombus muscorum .
The world 's first bumblebee sanctuary was established at Vane Farm in the Loch Leven National Nature Reserve in Scotland in 2008 .
In 2011 , London 's Natural History Museum led the establishment of an International Union for the Conservation of Nature Bumblebee Specialist Group , chaired by Dr. Paul H. Williams , to assess the threat status of bumblebee species worldwide using Red List criteria .
Bumblebee conservation is in its infancy in many parts of the world , but with the realization of the important part they play in pollination of crops , efforts are being made to manage farmland better .
Enhancing the wild bee population can be done by the planting of wildflower strips , and in New Zealand , bee nesting boxes have achieved some success , perhaps because there are few burrowing mammals to provide potential nesting sites in that country .
MISCONCEPTION ABOUT FLIGHT Section::::Misconception about flight .
According to 20th - century folklore , the laws of aerodynamics prove the bumblebee should be incapable of flight , as it does not have the capacity ( in terms of wing size or beats per second ) to achieve flight with the degree of wing loading necessary .
The origin of this claim has been difficult to pin down with any certainty .
John H. McMasters recounted an anecdote about an unnamed Swiss aerodynamicist at a dinner party who performed some rough calculations and concluded , presumably in jest , that according to the equations , bumblebees can not fly .
In later years , McMasters backed away from this origin , suggesting there could be multiple sources , and the earliest he has found was a reference in the 1934 book by French entomologist Antoine Magnan ( 1881–1938 ) ; they had applied the equations of air resistance to insects and found their flight was impossible , but " One should n't be surprised that the results of the calculations do n't square with reality " .
The following passage appears in the introduction to Le Vol des Insectes :
This translates to : Magnan refers to his assistant André Sainte - Laguë .
Some credit physicist Ludwig Prandtl ( 1875–1953 ) of the University of Göttingen in Germany with popularizing the idea .
Others say Swiss gas dynamicist Jacob Ackeret ( 1898–1981 ) did the calculations .
The calculations that purported to show that bumblebees can not fly are based upon a simplified linear treatment of oscillating aerofoils .
The method assumes small amplitude oscillations without flow separation .
This ignores the effect of dynamic stall ( an airflow separation inducing a large vortex above the wing ) , which briefly produces several times the lift of the aerofoil in regular flight .
More sophisticated aerodynamic analysis shows the bumblebee can fly because its wings encounter dynamic stall in every oscillation cycle .
Additionally , John Maynard Smith , a noted biologist with a strong background in aeronautics , has pointed out that bumblebees would not be expected to sustain flight , as they would need to generate too much power given their tiny wing area .
However , in aerodynamics experiments with other insects , he found that viscosity at the scale of small insects meant even their small wings can move a very large volume of air relative to their size , and this reduces the power required to sustain flight by an order of magnitude .
IN MUSIC AND LITERATURE Section::::In music and literature .
The orchestral interlude Flight of the Bumblebee was composed ( c. 1900 ) by Nikolai Rimsky - Korsakov .
It represents the turning of Prince Guidon into a bumblebee so he can fly away to visit his father , Tsar Saltan , in the opera
The Tale of Tsar Saltan , although the music may reflect the flight of a bluebottle rather than a bumblebee .
The music inspired Walt Disney to feature a bumblebee in his 1940 animated musical Fantasia and have it sound as if it were flying in all parts of the theater .
This early attempt at " surround sound " was unsuccessful , and the music was excluded from the film 's release .
In 1599 , during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I , someone , possibly Tailboys Dymoke , published Caltha Poetarum : Or The Bumble Bee , under the pseudonym " T. Cutwode " .
This was one of nine books censored under the Bishop 's Ban issued by the Archbishop of Canterbury John Whitgift and the Bishop of London Richard Bancroft .
Emily Dickinson made a bumblebee the subject of her parody of Isaac Watts 's well - known poem about honeybees , How Doth the Little Busy Bee ( 1715 ) .
Where Watts wrote " How skilfully she builds her cell !
How neat she spreads the wax ! "
, Dickinson 's poem , " The Bumble - Bee 's Religion " ( 1881 ) begins " His little Hearse - like Figure / Unto itself a Dirge / To a delusive Lilac / The vanity divulge / Of Industry and Morals / And every righteous thing / For the divine Perdition / of Idleness and Spring .
" The letter was said to have enclosed a dead bee .
The entomologist Otto Plath wrote Bumblebees and Their Ways in 1934 .
His daughter , the poet Sylvia Plath , wrote a group of poems about bees late in 1962 , within four months of her suicide , transforming her father 's interest into her poetry .
The scientist and illustrator Moses Harris ( 1731–1785 ) painted accurate watercolour drawings of bumblebees in his An Exposition of English Insects Including the Several Classes of Neuroptera , Hymenoptera , & Diptera , or Bees , Flies , & Libellulae ( 1776–80 ) .
Bumblebees appear as characters , often eponymously , in children 's books .
The surname Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series ( 1997–2007 ) is an old name for bumblebee .
J. K. Rowling said the name " seemed to suit the headmaster , because one of his passions is music and I imagined him walking around humming to himself " .
J. R. R. Tolkien , in his poem Errantry , also used the name Dumbledor , but for a large bee - like creature .
Among the many books for younger children are Bumble the Bee by Yvon Douran and Tony Neal ( 2014 ) ; Bertie Bumble Bee by K. I. Al - Ghani ( 2012 ) ; Ben the Bumble Bee : How do bees make honey ?
by Romessa Awadalla ( 2015 )

Among Beatrix Potter 's " little books " , Babbity Bumble and other members of her nest appear in The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse ( 1910 ) .
Bumblebee is the name of a prominent character in the Transformers franchise .
His name denotes his black - on - yellow vehicle paint job , directly referencing the bee genus because of its black and yellow stripes .
Bumblebee is also the name of an automotive racing stripe that wraps around the grill instead of down the centre of the vehicle ; it can be found mainly on Chevrolet Camaros ( which happens to be the Transformers Autobot 's most popular vehicle mode ) .
