Section::::Historical accuracy .
During an interview at the Roma Fest panel in 2015 , Spotnitz stated , " the season will be more thriller than historical saga ...
we begin the show with a ' what if ' because we do n't know how Giovanni de ' Medici died .
One of the questions that haunts Cosimo , is whether his father was murdered " .
LOCATIONS Section::::Locations .
Several noticeable locations are used throughout the series , in addition to sets and sound stages :
* Bracciano Castle : The principal courtyards and staircases of the Orsini - Odescalchi castle in Bracciano serve as streets in Florence , a palace in Rome , and the ancestral home of Contessina de ' Bardi .
The central courtyard in the Castle features a particularly recognisable staircase with the sculpture of a bear ; this staircase becomes the principal entrance of the Medici home in Florence with the addition of the Medici Coat of Arms .
* The Villa Farnese in Caprarola and its gardens : The frescoed and ring - vaulted internal terrace - courtyard of Villa Caprarola doubles as a Medici villa in the series , while an un - frescoed terrace is used as a Vatican property in Rome .
The Caprarola secret gardens with their unique fountains are used to represent the Vatican Gardens .
The creators took significant liberties with sets , often showing interior decorations , works of art , and exterior landscapes that were created many years after the events described in the series which occur in the mid-1430s .
For example , the Medici Palazzo was built in 1440s–1480s and the Benozzo Gozzoli frescoes of Magi Chapel shown in the Cosimo study were executed in 1459–61 .
The Lorenzo rooms are decorated with the Giulio Romano fresco " Mars and Venus " which was painted in the 1520s in Palazzo Te in Mantova .
During the episode exile in Venice , the church of Santa Maria della Salute built in the 1630s is repeatedly shown as part of the Venice city landscape .
Villa Medici contains " Fortitude and Temperance with Six Antique Heroes " by Perugino , painted in 1497 .
* Castle of Santa Severa is Cardinal Baldassarre Cossa 's Palace .
*
The medieval oldtown of Viterbo and its Palazzo dei Papi are the set for late medieval Rome .
* Hadrian 's Villa in Tivoli is another set for Rome ; Cosimo meets Donatello along the Canopus .
* Borgo di Rota , a frazione of Tolfa , is the set for Francesco Sforza 's army camp and the village where Lorenzo meets mercenary Ferzetti .
* Pienza : used as the Palazzo Medici , the streets of Florence , and the background for Cosimo 's wedding .
* Montepulciano : Several scenes are filmed outside the Duomo using the unfinished façade of the cathedral as a backdrop .
These scenes often incorrectly show the Duomo of Florence rising in the background to the north .
The Communal Palace , also in Piazza Grande , is part of several scenes , as is the Church of San Biagio .
