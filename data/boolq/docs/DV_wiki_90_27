TREE
TOPPING Tree topping is the practice of removing whole tops of trees or large branches and/or trunks from the tops of trees , leaving stubs or lateral branches that are too small to assume the role of a terminal leader .
Other common names for the practice include hat - racking , heading , rounding over , and tipping .
Some species of trees are more likely to recover from the effects of topping than are others .
There are alternatives to topping that can help to achieve the same goals without damaging trees .
PURPOSE
Section::::Purpose .
Hundreds of large trees are topped each year , which causes significant stress and future safety issues .
It has been shown through survey that the average person 's knowledge on tree care is limited .
Another popular misconception is that a topped tree will benefit from increased light penetration .
The removal of a large portion of a trees canopy can have detrimental effects .
When a tree is topped , newly formed bark may be susceptible to sun scald .
Prolonged exposure can severely damage the bark , thus creating an attractive home for decay - causing organisms .
Evidence of decay may be the presence of conks ( fungal fruiting structures ) on the outer tree bark .
The loss of leaves reduces a tree 's ability to photosynthesize and produce food .
If a large tree is unable to produce enough sugars to feed the roots , it will slowly die from starvation .
Some people have been known to top trees in order to stimulate new growth .
When a tree is topped , many adventitious shoots , known as suckers begin to grow from the wound .
This is the tree 's response to the sudden loss of leaves .
Although the tree is able to produce an abundance of suckers , they are susceptible to numerous problems .
Firstly , this adventitious growth is succulent and susceptible to attacks by insects such as aphids and caterpillars , and pathogens like fire blight ( Rosaceae ) .
Secondly , the branch - stubs that the suckers emerge from are rarely able to form a complete callus .
This means that any pathogen that attacks a sucker may enter the tree directly though the open wound .
If wood begins to rot it could create a weak branch connection between the developing suckers and the main tree leading to a possible branch failure .
If a tree is unable to compartmentalize the fungi , it may reach the trunk and ultimately kill the tree .
Aesthetics is another reason why people hire arborists to top their trees .
A tree may be blocking the mountain view , shading the garden , or interfering with solar energy collection .
As a result , the tree never fully returns to its initial natural form .
TOPPING PRECAUTIONS Section::::Topping precautions .
Large pruning wounds , such as those left behind in trees after topping , may become entry points for pathogens and may result in extensive decay .
Decay undermines , to greater or lesser extent , the long - term health and physical stability of trees ; most notably in those species which compartmentalize decay less effectively .
Should a tree survive topping , tissue regrowth at the site of the original topping wound(s ) is generally profuse .
These new multiple leaders are less well - attached than was the original treetop , partly due to the effect of advancing decay at the wound site .
As these weakly attached trunks increase in size , they become more prone to fall from the tree .
Wind can increase this potential .
Previously topped trees can present significant hazards and should be inspected by a qualified arborist , who can recommend possible solutions , such as removal , cabling , bracing , or ongoing inspection .
Aesthetic appeal is also compromised by topping , as the natural shapes of trees are lost .
ALTERNATIVES TO TOPPING Section::::Alternatives to topping .
Better alternatives to tree topping , based on scientific research , are replacing the practice of tree topping .
For example , size reduction can maintain the aesthetics and structural integrity of a tree without damage .
Spiral thinning and other forms of canopy thinning can decrease wind resistance and allow wind to pass through trees , reducing the potential for branch failure due to wind - throw .
Thinning also allows more light penetration and air circulation ; both important to tree health .
Other cultural practices include choosing plant material that will fit in the desired location at its mature size .
