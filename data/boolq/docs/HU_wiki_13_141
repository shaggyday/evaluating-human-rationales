PLOT Section::::Plot .
Four stage magicians , J. Daniel " Danny " Atlas ( Jesse Eisenberg ) , Merritt McKinney ( Woody Harrelson ) , Henley Reeves ( Isla Fisher ) , and Jack Wilder ( Dave Franco ) , are each given a tarot card that leads them to the same empty New York City apartment where they find information from an unknown benefactor .
A year later , the four have their first major performance as the Four Horsemen in an elaborate Las Vegas show funded by insurance magnate Arthur Tressler ( Michael Caine ) .
Their final trick appears to transport one of the audience members to the vault of his bank , the Crédit Républicain in Paris , where stacks of new euro bills are stored .
At the magicians ' command , the fans in the vault activate , drawing the bills into the vents and then showering the Las Vegas crowd with them .
The euros are shown to be real , and the vault in Paris is found to be empty of its recent shipment of euros .
FBI agent Dylan Rhodes ( Mark Ruffalo ) , and Interpol agent Alma Dray ( Mélanie Laurent ) , are then partnered to investigate the Horsemen .
The two question the magicians but have no evidence to hold them .
Dylan and Alma turn to Thaddeus Bradley ( Morgan Freeman ) , a former magician who now makes money by explaining the tricks behind magic acts .
Thaddeus demonstrates how the Horsemen used a mock vault under the Las Vegas stage and says that the group must have stolen the money in Paris before it arrived at the bank , replacing it with flash paper that left no evidence .
Dylan , Alma , and Thaddeus follow the Horsemen to their next show in New Orleans , where their final trick appears to transfer millions of dollars from Tressler 's private accounts to those in the audience , made up of people that were denied insurance claims by Tressler 's company in the wake of Hurricane Katrina .
Dylan and Alma attempt to apprehend the four , but the magicians elude arrest .
Tressler hires Thaddeus to expose the Horsemen in revenge for the loss of his money .
Alma investigates the Horsemen and determines they are connected to a group called the Eye , a small group of magicians that claim to have access to real magic .
She finds out one of the Eye 's members , Lionel Shrike , had previously been exposed by Thaddeus but died in a locked - safe escape trick he was performing in an attempt to regain his standing .
Alma suspects a fifth person is aiding the Horsemen .
Alma 's research leads the FBI to the New York City apartment .
When they raid it , three of the Horsemen escape while Jack recovers numerous documents and then leads the authorities on a high - speed car chase .
Jack loses control of his car , causing it to flip and catch fire .
Dylan is unable to save Jack , but manages to recover the papers , pointing to the Horsemen 's next planned crime , stealing millions of dollars in cash out of a large safe of the Elkhorn company .
Dylan , Alma , and Thaddeus find the safe has already been stolen , and when they track it down , its contents have been replaced with balloon animals .
The Horsemen broadcast they will perform their final show that night at 5 Pointz , inviting the public to attend .
The FBI and police converge on the scene and amid the chaos search for the Horsemen .
The remaining Horsemen appear to the crowd , giving their fans a farewell and a message about an ulterior purpose , and then run to jump off a roof ; Dylan attempts to shoot them but Alma holds him back .
The three jump , turning into a shower of money over the crowd .
The money is counterfeit , but the audience 's race to collect it prevents the authorities from tracking the real Horsemen .
After the show , Thaddeus walks to his car , only to find it full of the money stolen from the Elkhorn safe .
Assumed to be the fifth Horseman , he is arrested .
Dylan speaks to Thaddeus in jail , where Thaddeus slowly comes to realize that Alma 's theory was correct , and Dylan was the fifth Horseman .
Dylan quietly walks away , leaving Thaddeus shouting " Why ? " .
Elsewhere , the Horsemen ( including Jack , who had faked his death using a cadaver and a duplicate car ) meet at the carousel in Central Park , and use their tarot cards to turn it on .
Dylan arrives and welcomes the four to the Eye .
Later , at the Pont des Arts , Dylan meets with Alma and reveals he is Shrike 's son .
He brought the Horsemen together to get retribution for his father 's death : the Elkhorn Safe Company for providing a faulty safe that led to the accident ; Thaddeus for humiliating and impoverishing his father and forcing him to try the new trick to regain his standing ; and the Crédit Républicain and Tressler 's insurance companies for failing to pay out life insurance on Shrike afterwards .
Alma , who has come into a romantic relationship with Dylan , decides not to turn him in .
She takes a lock and a key that Dylan produces , attaching the lock among the other love locks on the railing and throwing the key into the Seine .
