ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES IN OREGON
The U.S. state of Oregon has an extensive history of laws regulating the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages , dating back to 1844 .
It has been an alcoholic beverage control state , with the Oregon Liquor Control Commission holding a monopoly over the sale of all distilled beverages , since Prohibition .
Today , there are thriving industries producing beer , wine , and liquor in the state .
Alcohol may be purchased between 7 a.m. and 2:30 a.m.
As of 2007 , consumption of spirits is on the rise , while beer consumption is holding steady .
Also , 11 % of beer sold in Oregon was brewed in - state , the highest figure in the United States .
Oregon wine production began in the mid-19th century , before it was a state .
By 1919 , the industry had collapsed due to prohibition , and after prohibition ended fruit wines dominated the industry .
The modern era of Oregon wine began in 1961 , and the industry cemented its reputation in 1975 by winning a French award .
In 2007 , wine making was a $ 207.8 million business .
Beer production began in 1852 with Henry Saxer 's liberty brewing in Portland .
In 1862 Henry Weinhard 's bought the Liberty brewery .
The company is now a part of the Miller Brewing Company , but it helped Portland to become the microbrewing capital of the world .
Portland hosts North America 's largest beerfest , and Oregon has produced a number of national and international award winning beers .
In 1844 , the Oregon territories voted to prohibit alcoholic beverages .
This was repealed in 1845 , but prohibition was reinstated in a 1915 , four years before the national alcohol prohibition .
When national prohibition was repealed in 1933 , the Oregon Liquor Control Commission ( OLCC ) was created .
Unlike states that allow liquor sales in grocery stores , liquor in Oregon is sold only in OLCC run liquor stores and establishments that have liquor licenses , and the OLCC has strict guidelines and training to ensure that all licensed venues understand how to safely sell and serve alcoholic beverages .
Alcohol and alcoholism are also studied by the state at the Portland Alcohol Research Center .
CONSUMPTION Section::::Consumption .
Alcohol laws in Oregon permit the sale of beer , wine , and liquor , for on- or off - premises consumption , between 7 a.m. and 2:30 a.m.
In 2004 , Oregonians consumed of distilled spirits , of wine , and of beer , ranking it 27th , 19th , and 27th respectively of US states .
Oregon had an estimated population of 3,594,586 in 2004 , ranking it 27th among US states .
In 2007 , sales of spirits increased 9 % over the previous year .
Whiskey and vodka were the top sellers , while tequila had the largest percentage increase .
Oregonians ' top buy was Jack Daniel 's , with 412,000 bottles sold .
This was during a national spirits trend where manufacturers introduced new products and advertising aimed at young drinkers .
Again in 2007 , Oregon 's 2.6 million adults on average drank 32 gallons of beer each , versus 4 gallons of wine and 2 gallons of spirits , but sales of beer had n't increased like sales of spirits .
The Oregon Department of Human Services reported that while drinking among 8th–11th graders has fallen nationally , it has increased in Oregon .
The number of DUI offenses dropped between 2002 and 2005 , from 25,342 to 23,455 .
BEER CONSUMPTION Section::::Beer consumption .
The following table lists the amount of beer consumed in Oregon for the years 1997–2004 as reported in the 2005 Beer Handbook .
The scale is in 1,000s of cases of beer .

PRODUCTION
WINE Section::::Production .
Section::::Wine .
Wine grapes were planted in Oregon in the Willamette Valley starting in 1847 .
A census in 1860 revealed that Oregon 's wine production was 2,600 gallons .
In the 1880s and 1890s , German immigrants began planting wine grapes in Southern Oregon .
In the 1880s , Ernest Reuter garnered a reputation for his Klevner wines , grown in the Willamette Valley , west of Forest Grove .
By 1919 , the Oregon wine industry had collapsed due to the temperance movement and resulting prohibition .
Fruit wines dominated Oregon 's wine industry post - prohibition , and by 1938 there were 28 bonded wineries , producing wines based on berries , Concord grapes , and other American hybrids .
Oregon 's modern wine industry dates to 1961 when Hillcrest Vineyard in Roseburg began planting Riesling and small amounts of other grapes .
In 1965 , Oregon pinot noir was established when The Eyrie Vineyards planted grapes near Corvallis .
Oregon 's wine reputation was made in 1979 when a French magazine ranked The Eyrie 's 1975 Pinot noir third among 330 wines of the world .
By 2007 , Oregon wineries were producing 1.7 million cases of wine for a total of $ 207.8 million in sales .
There are several official American Viticultural Areas entirely within the state , including the Willamette Valley , Southern Oregon , Umpqua Valley , and Rogue Valley AVAs .
Parts of the Columbia Gorge , Walla Walla Valley , and Snake River Valley AVAs lie within Oregon .
Pinot noir and Pinot gris are the top two grapes grown .
BEER Section::::Beer .
In 1862 , German immigrant Henry Weinhard founded a brewery in Portland .
By the early 1880s it had become the Northwest 's largest brewery .
Weinhard once attempted to pump free beer through Portland 's Skidmore Fountain .
He died in 1904 , but the company continued to do well , making it through prohibition by brewing soft drinks and merging with Arnold Blitz , a local competitor .
Blitz - Weinhard was sold to the Pabst Brewing Company in 1979 , and then again to the Miller Brewing Company in 1999 .
The company helped prepare Oregon beer drinkers for the arrival of microbrewing .
Portland , Oregon is considered to be the nation 's microbrew capital .
A microbrewery is defined as one that produces less than 15,000 barrels a year .
Portland hosts the Oregon Brewers Festival , North America 's largest beer festival .
The microbrewery industry began in 1979 when President Jimmy Carter legalized home brewing .
In 2006 , 14 beers from eight Oregon breweries won medals at the Great American Beer Festival , out of 2,800 entries .
Also in 2006 , Oregon won 11 times at the World Beer Cup , in a field of 2,200 beers .
In 2007 , 11 % of beer sold in Oregon was brewed in - state , the highest figure in the United States .
According to the Oregon Hop Commission , in 2007 , Oregon was also the second largest U.S. hops producer , after Washington .
SPIRITS Section::::Spirits .
As of 2008 , Oregon contains 12 of the nation 's 142 craft distilleries , up from six in 2006 .
In 2007 , a law was approved allowing tasting rooms and direct sales to the public .
Jim Dodge , purchasing manager for the OLCC , believes that the distilleries are an outgrowth of the microbrew industry , instead of the wine industry , as well as a societal change .
Dodge explained that " there 's been a recent shift from beer , and to some degree wine , to distilled spirits as the alcohol of choice . "
In 2008 , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration determined that absinthe was legal , though it had been understood to be illegal for about 80 years .
Portland distillery Integrity Spirits responded by releasing the second American - made absinthe , which was in high demand immediately upon its release .
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
Section::::Legislative history .
Oregon has been regulating alcohol through its laws for over 150 years .
In 1844 , the Oregon Territory voted to prohibit alcoholic beverages .
This is often referred to as the first prohibition in the United States .
The law was repealed in 1845 .
From 1845 to 1915 , various local laws governing alcohol were passed .
In 1915 , Oregonians voted to ban all alcohol , preceding national alcohol prohibition by four years .
In 1933 , national prohibition ended with a repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution .
Oregon 's governor , Julius Meier , appointed Dr. William S. Knox to study the situation .
Knox recommended adopting the Canadian system of sales of alcohol by the state .
The reasoning was that this would provide revenue and lower alcohol abuse .
The Oregon Legislative Assembly held a special session and the OLCC was created days after the repeal of national prohibition .
Eighteen states in total chose to regulate alcohol .
Oregon Revised Statutes Chapters 471 , 472 , 473 and 474 were the commission 's enabling statutes .
OAR Chapter 845 governed its administrative rules .
The OLCC 's mission is " to effectively regulate the sale , distribution , and responsible use of alcoholic beverages in order to protect Oregon 's public health , safety and community livability . "
However , under these laws bootlegging in Oregon was rife and Portland became infamous as a center of corruption .
In 1939 , the advertising of hard liquor on billboards and in newspapers was voluntarily discontinued .
Also , in 1939 , a " club bill " was passed by the Legislative Assembly .
The bill gave regulatory power to the OLCC over hotels , restaurants and private clubs where liquor was served .
Lobbyists then succeeded in having the bill referred to the voters in 1940 .
Voters passed the bill in 1940 .
In 1944 , the " Burke Bill " became law : wines with more than 14 % alcohol could only be sold by Commission stores and agencies .
Also in the 1940s , a " service bars " license was established .
This restricted liquor licenses to establishments serving food .
In 1949 , the Legislative Assembly approved a method where establishments that sold liquor could ask for proof of age from patrons they thought were under the age of 21 .
Measure 15—passed in 1952—amended the Constitution ( ) to regulate the sale of liquor by the individual glass .
Five more types of licenses were created in the 1950s , dealing with liquor - by - the - drink operations , industry agents , salesmen , out - of - state manufacturers of malt beverages , and conventions , group meetings , etc .
In 1960 , establishments were required to have food sales equal to 25 % of their total sales .
In the 1970s , the OLCC began enforcing the Oregon Bottle Bill and wines of up to 20 % alcohol became allowed with certain licenses .
In the 1980s , the number of OLCC commissioners was changed from three to five , to reflect the number of congressional districts .
The 1990s saw a flurry of laws passed governing the OLCC 's oversight of the newly numerous Oregon wineries and microbreweries .
House Bill 4028–passed in 2002–allowed liquor stores to operate on Sunday ; they had previously been restricted to six days a week .
This sort of licensing is very important for maintaining safe production and sales of alcoholic beverages in Oregon .
Under Oregon law , specifically ORS 471.565 , bars and restaurants can be held legally responsible for any damages to property or injuries incurred when an intoxicated person is served alcohol and causes a car crash .
