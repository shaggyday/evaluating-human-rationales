WORDPAD
WordPad is a basic word processor that is included with almost all versions of Microsoft Windows from Windows 95 onwards .
It is more advanced than Microsoft Notepad but simpler than Microsoft Works Word Processor and Microsoft Word .
It replaced Microsoft Write .
FEATURES Section::::Features .
WordPad
can format and print text , including fonts , bold , italic , colored , and centered text , etc . , but lacks vital functions such as a spell checker , thesaurus , and control over pagination .
It does not support footnotes or endnotes .
However WordPad can read , render , and save many Rich Text Format ( RTF ) features that it can not create , such as tables , strikeout , superscript , subscript , " extra " colors , text background colors , numbered lists , right or left indent , quasi - hypertext and URL linking , or various line spacing .
Among its advantages are low system - resource usage , simplicity , and speed .
Pasting into or from an HTML document such as from the internet or email will typically automatically convert most or all of it to RTF ( although this is partially browser - dependent ) .
As such , WordPad is well suited for taking notes , writing letters and stories , or for usage in various tablets , PCs , and smart phones .
However , WordPad is underpowered for work that relies heavily on graphics or typesetting such as most publishing - industry requirements for rendering final hard copy .
WordPad natively supports RTF , though it does not support all the features defined in the RTF / Word 2007 specification .
Previous versions of WordPad also supported the " Word for Windows 6.0 " format , which is forward compatible with the Microsoft Word format .
In Windows 95 , 98 and Windows 2000 , it used Microsoft 's RichEdit control , versions 1.0 , 2.0 and 3.0 respectively .
In Windows XP SP1 and later , it uses RichEdit 4.1 , including Windows 7 .
WordPad for Windows XP added full Unicode support , enabling WordPad to support multiple languages , but UTF-16 / UCS-2 Big Endian is not supported .
It can open Microsoft Word ( versions 6.0 - 2003 ) files , although it opens newer versions of the .DOC format with incorrect formatting .
Also , unlike previous WordPad versions , it can not save files in the .doc format ( only .txt or .rtf ) .
Files saved as Unicode text are encoded as UTF-16 LE .
Windows XP Service Pack 2
onwards reduced support for opening .WRI files for security purposes .
Windows XP Tablet PC Edition SP2 and Windows Vista include speech recognition , and therefore dictation into WordPad is possible .
In these and later Windows versions , the RichEdit control was added and as a result , WordPad now supports extensible third - party services ( such as grammar and spell check ) built using the Text Services Framework ( TSF ) .
In Windows Vista , support for reading Microsoft Word DOC files was removed because of the incorrect rendering and formatting problems , as well as a Microsoft security bulletin that reported a security vulnerability in opening Word files in WordPad .
For viewing older ( 97 - 2003 ) as well as newer ( Office Open XML ) documents , Microsoft recommends Word Viewer , which is available free .
Native Office Open XML and ODF support was released in the Windows 7 version of WordPad .
Microsoft has updated the user interface for WordPad in Windows 7 , giving it an Office 2010-style ribbon that replaces the application menu and toolbars .
Other bundled Windows applications such as Paint have had similar interface makeovers .
HISTORY Section::::History .
WordPad was introduced in Windows 95 , replacing Microsoft Write , which came with all previous versions of Windows ( version 3.11 and earlier ) .
The source code to WordPad was also distributed by Microsoft as a Microsoft Foundation Classes sample application with MFC 3.2 and later , shortly before the release of Windows 95 .
It is still available for download from the MSDN website .
The default font used in Windows 95 to Windows Vista was Arial 10 ; in Windows 7 it was changed to Calibri 11 .
A similar word processor , also called WordPad , is supplied by some vendors on a Windows CE pre - installation .
It has simple functionality like its desktop OS cousin .
The icon resembles an early Microsoft Word icon .
