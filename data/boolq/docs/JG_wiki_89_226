2018 AFRICAN NATIONS CHAMPIONSHIP
The 2018 African Nations Championship , known as the Total African Nations Championship ( also referred to as CHAN 2018 ) was the 5th edition of the African Nations Championship , a biennial football tournament organized by the Confederation of African Football ( CAF ) exclusively featuring players from the respective national championships .
It took place between 12 January and 4 February 2018 .
In February 2016 , Kenya was announced as the host nation but in September 2017 , CAF decided to change the host nation due to a lack of progress with preparations .
Morocco was announced as the host nation in October 2017 .
Unlike the African Cup of Nations , the competing national teams must be composed of players playing in their domestic league .
For example , a Moroccan player is only eligible to play for the Morocco national team if he is playing for a Moroccan club .
Hosts Morocco defeated Nigeria in the final to win their first title .
DR Congo were the defending champions but failed to qualify for the first time ever after losing to Congo on away goals rule .
HOST SELECTION
Section::::Host selection .
Initially , Kenya was announced as the host nation in February 2016 .
But in September 2017 , CAF decided to change the host nation due to a lack of progress with preparations .
The CAF received three bids by the deadline of 30 September 2017 to replace Kenya as new hosts :
The Ethiopian Football Federation did not provide the government 's letter of guarantee , and were not considered .
The CAF Emergency Committee decided to choose Morocco over Equatorial Guinea in October 2017 .
QUALIFICATION Section::::Qualification .
The qualifying rounds took place from April to August 2017 .
Since Morocco had already qualified in the North Zone before being named as replacement hosts , their spot in the final tournament was re - allocated to Egypt , which lost to Morocco in the North Zone final qualifying round .
However , Egypt declined to participate citing a " congested domestic calendar " .
As a result , the spot was reverted to Central - East Zone ( as originally three teams would participate including Kenya as original hosts ) , and would go to the winner of a play - off in November 2017 between Ethiopia and Rwanda , the two teams which lost in the Central - East Zone final qualifying round .
