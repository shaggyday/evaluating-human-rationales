HISTORY Section::::History .
SeaWorld was founded on March 21 , 1964 by four graduates of the University of California , Los Angeles .
Although their original idea of an underwater restaurant was not feasible at the time , the idea was expanded into a marine zoological park along the shore of Mission Bay in San Diego .
After an investment of about $ 1.5 million , the park opened with 45 employees , several dolphins , sea lions , and two seawater aquariums , and hosted more than 400,000 visitors in its first year of operation .
Initially held as a private partnership , SeaWorld offered its stock publicly in 1968 enabling them to expand and open additional parks .
The second SeaWorld location , SeaWorld Ohio , opened in 1970 , followed by SeaWorld Orlando in 1973 and SeaWorld San Antonio ( the largest of the parks ) in 1988 .
SeaWorld Ohio was later sold to Six Flags in January 2001 .
The parks were owned and operated by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich between 1976 and 1989 , when they were purchased by Anheuser - Busch Companies ,
Inc. After Anheuser - Busch was acquired by InBev , SeaWorld San Diego and the rest of the company 's theme parks were sold to the Blackstone Group in December 2009 , which operates the park through its SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment division .
SeaWorld currently leases the land from the City of San Diego with the lease expiring in 2048 .
