PLOT Section::::Plot .
Molly Bloom is a world - class mogul skier with Olympic aspirations , the result of years of enforced training from her overbearing father .
In a qualifying event for the 2002 Winter Olympics , she is severely injured , ending her career .
Instead of following her original plan of attending law school , Molly decides to take a year off and move to Los Angeles .
Once she arrives , she becomes a bottle service waitress at a club , where she meets Dean , an ostentatious but unsuccessful real estate developer .
She becomes his office manager , and he soon involves her in running his underground poker games .
Many famous and wealthy individuals , such as movie stars , investment bankers , and sports players , are involved in Dean 's game .
Molly earns large sums of money on tips alone .
Molly is initially uninformed on poker topics but quickly learns how to appeal to the players to gain tips .
In particular , she hopes to please the most successful player , Player X , by attracting new players to the game .
Dean , upon seeing that Molly is becoming increasingly independent in running the games , attempts to control her , and then he fires her .
Molly , having gained contacts through years of running the game , decides to create her own poker games .
She rents a penthouse at a hotel and hires a staff to help her run games .
Additionally , she contacts employees at clubs and casinos to try and spread word about her poker games .
Player X , along with many other players , decides to leave Dean 's games to play at Molly 's game .
Molly becomes increasingly successful , gaining more money while being pressured by Player X to raise the stakes for her games .
Harlan Eustice , a skilled , conservative , and successful player , joins Molly 's game .
One night , after accidentally losing a hand to the notorious worst player in Molly 's circle , Harlan becomes increasingly compulsive , suffering heavy losses ( later , Molly finds out that Player X , who enjoys ruining people 's lives more than the game itself , has been funding Harlan to keep him in the game ) .
After Molly berates him for his unethical actions , Player X decides to change venue for his games , and the other players join him , leaving Molly .
Molly moves to New York , with the hope of beginning a new underground poker game .
After reaching out to many wealthy New Yorkers , Molly finds enough players for several weekly games .
Despite continuous success , she fears being unable to cover her losses when players can not pay .
Her dealer convinces her to begin taking a percentage of large pots , allowing her to recoup her potential losses but making her game an illegal gambling operation .
One of her Los Angeles players is indicted for running a Ponzi scheme ; Molly is investigated and questioned as to who attended her games .
At this time , Molly becomes increasingly addicted to drugs , as the games have increasingly taken their toll .
Her players also begin to include wealthy individuals from the Russian mafia , among others .
She is approached by several Italian mafia members who offer their services to extort money from non - paying players .
After she declines , she is attacked in her home , where she is held at gunpoint and her mother 's life is threatened .
As she is about to return to her poker games , the FBI conducts a raid , a result of Douglas Downey , one of her players , acting as an informant .
Molly 's assets are seized , and she returns home to live with her mother .
Two years later , Molly has moved out and published a book where she names a few individuals that played in her games .
She is arrested by the FBI and indicted for involvement in illegal gambling with the mafia .
She enlists the help of Charlie Jaffey , a high - profile and expensive lawyer in New York , who agrees to help after he learns that she has been protecting innocent people who were affected by her poker games .
While she is in New York awaiting trial , her father , Larry , seeks her out and attempts to reconcile with her .
He admits that he was overbearing and that he treated Molly differently than her brothers because she had known about his affairs .
Charlie reads Molly 's book and becomes interested in helping her case , as he feels she has not committed serious enough wrongdoing to merit a prison term .
Charlie negotiates a deal for Molly to receive no sentence and for her money to be returned in exchange for her hard drives and digital records from gambling .
Molly declines this deal , fearing that the information about her players would be released , and she pleads guilty .
The judge , deciding that she had committed no serious crimes , sentences her to community service , probation , and a $ 200,000 fine .
