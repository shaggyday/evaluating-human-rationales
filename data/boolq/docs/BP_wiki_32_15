PLOT Section::::Plot .
In a Louisiana assisted - living home in 1999 , Paul Edgecomb begins to cry while watching the film Top Hat .
His companion Elaine becomes concerned , and Paul explains to her that the film reminded him of the events of 1935 , which took place during The Great Depression when he was a prison officer , in charge of death row , what they refer to as the " Green Mile " .
In 1935 , Paul supervises officers Brutus Howell , Dean Stanton , Harry Terwilliger , and Percy Wetmore at Cold Mountain Penitentiary .
Paul is suffering from a severe bladder infection and receives John Coffey , a physically imposing but mentally challenged and gentle black man , into his custody .
John had been sentenced to death after being convicted of raping and murdering two white girls .
One of the other inmates is a Native - American named Arlen Bitterbuck , who is charged with murder and is the first to be executed .
Percy demonstrates a severe sadistic streak , but , as the nephew of Louisiana 's First Lady , he can not be held to account .
He is particularly abusive with inmate Eduard Delacroix ( Del ) ; he breaks Del 's fingers with his baton , steps on a pet mouse named Mr. Jingles , which Del had adopted , repeatedly calls him by a gay slur , and ultimately sabotages his execution by deliberately failing to soak the sponge used to conduct electricity to Del 's head , pretending he " did n't know " it was supposed to be wet ; as a result , Del suffers a much more painful and graphic death by literally frying in the chair .
John begins to demonstrate supernatural powers ; he cures Paul 's bladder infection , which also makes Paul able to please his wife , Jan , resurrects Mr. Jingles , and heals a dying Melinda Moores , wife of the prison 's chief warden , of a brain tumor .
He releases one last affliction into Percy , who under its influence shoots another prisoner , mass murderer William " Wild Bill " Wharton , dead .
Wharton had from the moment of his arrival been a troublemaker ; he assaulted the guards as he was being escorted into the block , made mischief on two occasions that later caused Paul to order him restrained in the block 's padded cell , groped Percy , made a racist remark in John 's presence , and revealed psychically to John that he is , in fact , responsible for the crime for which John was condemned ; John had been arrested for Wharton 's crime as he had been at the crime scene trying to resurrect the two white children with his powers , but was unsuccessful .
John then reveals the story psychically to Paul , and , when doing so , he also transfers a snippet of his supernatural energy into Paul .
Meanwhile , Percy is committed to an insane asylum after entering a vegetative state .
Paul discusses with John the possibility of an unlikely long term escape , as he does not wish to execute what he perceives is a miracle of God .
Although distraught over the notion of being executed while innocent , John tells Paul that he does , in fact , wish to die , as he psychically experiences humanity 's cruelty .
Mentioning that he had never seen a movie before , John watches Top Hat with the other guards as a last request .
John is executed that night ; he asks that the customary hood not be placed over his head , as he is afraid of the dark .
Paul concludes his story by telling Elaine that John 's was the last execution that he and Brutus supervised ; following Coffey 's execution , they both took jobs in the juvenile system .
Elaine realizes that , since he had a grown son in 1935 , Paul must be much older than he looks .
Paul reveals that he is , in fact , 108 years of age ; he was 44 when John was executed .
Not only is he still alive , but so is Del 's mouse , Mr. Jingles .
Paul continues to explain that although John never intended for it to happen , his curing of Paul has given him an extraordinary lifespan , causing him to outlive his family and friends , which he perceives is a punishment from God for executing him , and will also outlive Elaine .
Paul later attends her funeral and muses that if John 's power could make a normally short - lived mouse live for six decades as Mr. Jingles has , how much longer does he himself have left .
