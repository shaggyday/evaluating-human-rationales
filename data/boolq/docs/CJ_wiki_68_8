In 1981 the Eastern - based Home Hardware merged with Western - based Link Hardware to create a national chain .
Home Hardware has survived the expansion of The Home Depot into Canada , beginning in 1994 , as well as the expansion of a domestic competitor , Rona , Inc. , into the big - box arena .
In 2000 , the chain expanded through the purchase of the Beaver Lumber chain from Molson Brewery .
On January 11 , 2003 , Home Hardware received unexpected worldwide exposure , when a T - shirt worn by Avril Lavigne during a performance on Saturday Night Live featured her hometown of Greater Napanee , Ontario and the local hardware store there .
In response , the chain produced a limited - edition line of identical T - shirts for sale at locations nationwide , with proceeds going to charity .
In 2004 , Canada Post issued a postage stamp to commemorate the company 's 40th anniversary .
