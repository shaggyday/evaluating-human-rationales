ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY
Me Talk Pretty
One Day , published in 2000 , is a bestselling collection of essays by American humorist David Sedaris .
The book is separated into two parts .
The first part consists of essays about Sedaris 's life before his move to Normandy , France , including his upbringing in suburban Raleigh , North Carolina , his time working odd jobs in New York City , and a visit to New York from a childhood friend and her bumpkinish girlfriend .
The second section , " Deux " , tells of Sedaris 's move to Normandy with his partner Hugh , often drawing humor from his efforts to live in France without speaking the French language and his frustrated attempts to learn it .
Prior to publication , several of the essays were read by the author on the Public Radio International program , This American Life .
In April 2001 , Variety reported that Sedaris had sold the Me Talk Pretty One Day film rights to director Wayne Wang , who was adapting four stories from the book for Columbia Pictures with hopes of beginning shooting in late 2001 .
At the time , Sedaris commented , " It 's just one of those things I had never considered .
Like , ' What if I de - clawed a kitten ? '
But I like Wayne Wang a lot . "
He recommended Jack Lemmon to play his father and Elaine Stritch for his mother .
Wang had completed the script and begun casting when Sedaris asked to " get out of it , " after a conversation with his sister aroused concerns as to how his family might be portrayed on screen .
He wrote about the conversation and its aftermath in the essay " Repeat After Me " , published in Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim .
Sedaris recounted that Wang was " a real prince .
I did n't want him to be mad at me , but he was so grown up about it .
I never saw how it could be turned into a movie anyway . "
