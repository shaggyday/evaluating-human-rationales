After South Africa being disqualified and South Korea having withdrawn due to logistical reasons , North Korea had to compete in a play - off match against Australia in order to qualify , which they won 9 - 2 on aggregate .
In the third and decisive group match , North Korea beat title contenders Italy 1 - 0 , eliminating them from the competition and advancing to the second stage .
No team from Asia has ever progressed from the first round before , and the feat would not be repeated until 1994 , when Saudi Arabia reached the Round of 16 .
In the quarter - final against Portugal , North Korea managed to lead 3 - 0 after 22 minutes , but the game was turned around with a final score of 3 - 5 , with Portuguese star player Eusébio scoring four goals .
