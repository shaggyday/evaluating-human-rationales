PLOTS Section::::Plots .
The season follows the story of surgical residents , fellows , and attendings as they experience the difficulties of the competitive careers they have chosen .
It is set in the surgical wing of the fictional Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital , located in Seattle , Washington .
After the explosion at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital , Chief Miranda Bailey ( Chandra Wilson ) finds it the perfect time to give the place a much needed upgrade in look and functionality .
During the construction , Owen Hunt ( Kevin McKidd ) struggles with the shocking reunion with his sister , Megan ( Abigail Spencer ) , who was recently found in a hostage camp overseas .
The discovery also welcomes back Teddy Altman ( Kim Raver ) , the former chief of cardiothoracic surgery and Owen 's best friend , which leads to awkward moments with Amelia Shepherd ( Caterina Scorsone ) .
Of course , Nathan Riggs ( Martin Henderson ) , who was once in love with Megan , is torn between his love for her and his most recent interest in Meredith Grey ( Ellen Pompeo ) .
Arizona Robbins ( Jessica Capshaw ) learns what " ghosting " is after Eliza Minnick ( Marika Dominczyk ) vanishes without a trace , but she quickly finds company in an Italian girl she met at the bar , Carina DeLuca ( Stefania Spampinato ) , sister to Andrew DeLuca ( Giacomo Gianniotti ) .
Jo Wilson ( Camilla Luddington ) struggles to patch her relationship with Alex Karev ( Justin Chambers ) , but when her attempts fail , she finds herself sleeping with one of the new interns .
When Carina finds that Amelia has a brain tumor , she brings her former mentor / professor Dr Tom Koracek ( Greg Germann ) to create a treatment plan .
But when he points out how the tumor has affected her judgment , she fears that it might have ruined her patient 's lives or put them in more danger — specifically Dr Nicole Herman ( Geena Davis ) , who despite saving her life , was left blind .
After the tumor is removed , Amelia and Owen reflect on their marriage and decide that everything up to that point has been misguided ; the tumor made Amelia someone she was not , and they ultimately decide to get a divorce .
With all the changes happening at Grey Sloan , Harper Avery ( Chelcie Ross ) shows up to discuss everything with Bailey and then ends up firing her .
Shortly after , he immediately dies from cardiac arrest .
Before they have to find another chief , Catherine ( Debbie Allen ) and Jackson Avery ( Jesse Williams ) reinstate Bailey to her position .
At a family dinner hosted by Catherine and Richard Weber ( James Pickens Jr. ) , Maggie Pierce ( Kelly McCreary ) and Jackson learn that he will be receiving his grandfather 's inheritance , a quarter billion dollars , which he will eventually use to fund a medical research contest .
Now that Megan is healthy again , Meredith and Nathan work together to bring her son over to the United States .
Upon arrival , Nathan , Megan , and Farouk all move to California to start a life together , which officially ends Nathan 's relationship with Meredith .
Despite the breakup , Meredith has more exciting news on the horizon when she learns at the intern mixer that a ground breaking surgery has earned her a nomination for the highly - esteemed Harper Avery Foundation Award , which she goes on to win .
While the joyous news spreads around the hospital , Bailey learns that Ben Warren ( Jason George ) wants to leave surgery to join the Seattle Fire Department .

Now in the running for chief resident , Jo decides to file for divorce .
With her mind on her secret relationship with Paul , she is surprised to find him in the hospital .

As Paul keeps trying to find Jo , Meredith pretends to call security to have him removed , but he leaves before they can get there .
However , he winds up back in the ER as a victim of a hit and run accident .
