LIST OF NBA FRANCHISE POST - SEASON DROUGHTS
This is a list of National Basketball Association ( NBA ) franchise post - season appearance droughts .
This list includes the all - time and the active consecutive non - playoffs .
Aside from the NBA playoff appearance droughts , this list also includes droughts of series wins , appearances in the NBA Finals and NBA championship wins .
The teams which have never made an NBA Playoffs appearance , an NBA Finals appearance championship .
The oldest such franchise is the Suns ( 48 seasons ) , while the Royals / Kings and the Hawks have even longer championship droughts ( 67 and 60 seasons , respectively ) .
Seven franchises have never been to the NBA Finals , the highest number among the major North American sports .
The oldest such team is the Braves / Clippers franchise ( 45 seasons ) ; the Kings and the Hawks have appearance droughts that are even longer ( 65 and 58 seasons , respectively ) .
The longest a franchise has gone without appearing in the playoffs at all is 15 seasons : the Braves / Clippers franchise from 1977 to 1991 .
Of the 18 franchises that have won an NBA championship , 8 have droughts of 35 seasons or more , which is to say that the past 35 championships have been shared among only 10 franchises : the Lakers ( 8) , the Bulls ( 6 ) , the Spurs ( 5 ) , the Celtics ( 3 ) , the Pistons ( 3 ) , the Heat ( 3 ) , the Warriors ( 3 ) , the Rockets ( 2 ) , the Mavericks ( 1 ) , and the Cavaliers ( 1 ) .
By contrast , the other three major North American sports have each had at least 16 franchises become champions over the same period of time .
