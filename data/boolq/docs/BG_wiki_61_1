UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO
The University of San Diego ( USD ) is a private Roman Catholic research university located in San Diego , California .
Founded in 1949 as the San Diego College for Women and San Diego University , the academic institutions merged into the University of San Diego in 1972 .
Since then , the university has grown to comprise nine undergraduate and graduate schools , to include the Shiley - Marcos School of Engineering , Joan B. Kroc School of Peace Studies , and School of Law .
USD offers 79 undergraduate and graduate programs , and enrolls approximately 9,073 undergraduate , paralegal , graduate and law students .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Chartered in 1949 , the university opened its doors to its first class of students in 1952 as the San Diego College for Women .
Reverend Charles F. Buddy , D.D. , then bishop of the Diocese of San Diego and Reverend Mother Rosalie Hill , RSCJ , a Superior Vicaress of the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus , chartered the institution from resources drawn from their respective organizations on a stretch of land known as " Alcalá Park , " named for San Diego de Alcalá .
In September 1954 , the San Diego College for Men and the School of Law opened .
These two schools originally occupied Bogue Hall on the same site of University High School , which would later become the home of the University of San Diego High School .
Starting in 1954 , Alcalá Park also served as the diocesan chancery office and housed the episcopal offices , until the diocese moved to a vacated Benedictine convent that was converted to a pastoral center .
In 1957 , Immaculate Heart Major Seminary and St. Francis Minor Seminary were moved into their newly completed facility , now known as Maher Hall .
The Immaculata Chapel , now no longer affiliated with USD , also opened that year as part of the seminary facilities .
For nearly two decades , these schools co - existed on Alcalá Park .
Immaculate Heart closed at the end of 1968 , when its building was renamed De Sales Hall ; St. Francis remained open until 1970 , when it was transferred to another location on campus , leaving all of the newly named Bishop Leo T. Maher Hall to the newly merged co - educational University of San Diego in 1972 .
Since then , the university has grown quickly and has been able to increase its assets and academic programs .
The student body , the local community , patrons , alumni , and many organizations have been integral to the university 's development .
Significant periods of expansion of the university , since the 1972 merger , occurred in the mid-1980s , as well as in 1998 , when Joan B. Kroc , philanthropist and wife of McDonald 's financier Ray Kroc , endowed USD with a gift of $ 25 million for the construction of the Institute for Peace & Justice .
Other significant donations to the college came in the form of multimillion - dollar gifts from weight - loss tycoon Jenny Craig , inventor Donald Shiley , investment banker and alumnus Bert Degheri , and an additional gift of $ 50 million
Mrs. Kroc left the School of Peace Studies upon her death .
These gifts helped make possible , respectively , the Jenny Craig Pavilion ( an athletic arena ) , the Donald P. Shiley Center for Science and Technology , the Joan B. Kroc School of Peace Studies , and the Degheri Alumni Center .
As a result , USD has been able to host the West Coast Conference ( WCC ) basketball tournament in 2002 , 2003 and 2008 , and hosted international functions such as the Kyoto Laureate Symposium at the Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace & Justice and at USD 's Shiley Theatre .
Shiley 's gift has provided the university with some additional , and more advanced , teaching laboratories than it had previously .
In 2005 , the university expanded the Colachis Plaza from the Immaculata along Marian Way to the east end of Hall , which effectively closed the east end of the campus to vehicular traffic .
That same year , the student body approved plans for a renovation and expansion of the Hahn University Center which began at the end of 2007 .
The new Student Life Pavilion ( SLP ) opened in 2009 and hosts the university 's new student dining area(s ) , offices for student organizations and event spaces .
The Hahn University Center is now home to administrative offices , meeting and event spaces , and a restaurant and wine bar , La Gran Terazza .
In the fall of 2018 , USD 's total enrollment was 8,905 undergraduate , graduate , and law students .
ENVIRONMENT AND LOCATION Section::::Environment and location .
Alcalá Park sits atop the edge of a mesa overlooking Mission Bay and other parts of San Diego .
The philosophy of USD 's founder and her fellow religious relied on the belief that studying in beautiful surroundings could improve the educational experience of students .
Thus , the university 's buildings are designed in a 16th - century Spanish Renaissance architectural style , paying homage to both San Diego 's Catholic heritage and the Universidad de Alcalá in Spain .
In September 2011 , Travel+Leisure named it as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States .
The campus is located approximately two miles north of downtown San Diego , on the north crest of Mission Valley in the community of Linda Vista .
From the westernmost edges of Alcalá Park the communities of Mission Hills , Old Town , Point Loma , Ocean Beach , Bay Park , Mission Beach and Pacific Beach can be seen .
Also , the Pacific Ocean , San Diego Harbor , the Coronado Islands and La Jolla are visible from the campus .
ADMINISTRATION Section::::Administration .
Though a Catholic university , the school is no longer governed directly by the Diocese of San Diego .
Today , a lay board of trustees governs the university 's operations .
However , the Bishop of San Diego , Robert W. McElroy , retains a seat as a permanent member and retains control of the school 's designation of " Catholic . "
