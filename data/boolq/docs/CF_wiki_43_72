NEGATIVE - CALORIE FOOD
A negative - calorie food is food that supposedly requires more food energy to be digested than the food provides .
Its thermic effect or specific dynamic action — the caloric " cost " of digesting the food — would be greater than its food energy content .
Despite its recurring popularity in dieting guides , there is no scientific evidence supporting the idea that any food is calorically negative .
While some chilled beverages are calorically negative , the effect is minimal and drinking large amounts of water can be dangerous .

Foods that are claimed to be negative in calories are mostly low - calorie fruits and vegetables such as celery , grapefruit , lemon , lime , apple , lettuce , broccoli , and cabbage .
There is no scientific evidence to show that any of these foods have a negative calorific impact .
Celery has a thermic effect of around 8 % , much less than the 100 % or more required for a food to have " negative calories " .
Diets based on negative - calorie food do not work as advertised but can lead to weight loss because they satisfy hunger by filling the stomach with food that is not calorically dense .
A 2005 study based on a low - fat plant - based diet found that the average participant lost over fourteen weeks , and attributed the weight loss to the reduced energy density of the foods resulting from their low fat content and high fiber content , and the increased thermic effect .
A study on chewing gum reports mastication burns roughly per hour .
