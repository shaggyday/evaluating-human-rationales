CRISTA AMPULLARIS
The crista ampullaris is the sensory organ of rotation .
They are found in the ampullae of each of the semicircular canals of the inner ear , meaning that there are 3 pairs in total .
The function of the crista ampullaris is to sense angular acceleration and deceleration .
BACKGROUND Section::::Background .
The inner ear comprises three specialized regions of the membranous labyrinth : the vestibular sacs â€“ the utricle and saccule , and the semicircular canals , which are the vestibular organs , as well as the cochlear duct , which is involved in the special sense of hearing .
The semicircular canals are filled with endolymph due to its connection with the cochlear duct via the saccule , which also contains endolymph .
It also contains an inner membranous sleeve that lines the semicircular canals .
The canals also contain the crista ampullaris .
The receptor cells located in the semicircular ducts are innervated by the eighth cranial nerve , the vestibulocochlear nerve ( specifically the vestibular portion ) .
The crista ampullaris itself is a cone - shaped structure , covered in receptor cells called " hair cells " .
Covering the crista ampullaris is a gelatinous mass called the cupula .
Upon angular acceleration ( rotation ) , the endolymph within the semicircular duct deflects the cupula against the hair cells of the crista ampullaris .
The hair cells respond by stimulating neurons that innervate them .
