SATURN CORPORATION
The Saturn Corporation , also known as Saturn LLC , was an American automobile manufacturer , a registered trademark established on January 7 , 1985 , as a subsidiary of General Motors .
The company marketed itself as a " different kind of car company " and operated somewhat independently from its parent company for a time with its own assembly plant in Spring Hill , Tennessee ; unique models ; and a separate retailer network , and was GM 's attempt to compete with Japanese automakers .
Following the withdrawal of a bid by Penske Automotive to acquire Saturn in September 2009 , General Motors discontinued the Saturn brand and ended its outstanding franchises on October 31 , 2010 .
All new production was halted on October 7 , 2009 .
HISTORY 1982–1989 : FORMATION Section::::History .
Section::::1982–1989 : Formation .
Alex C. Mair began discussions of a " revolutionary new " , small car project codenamed Saturn in June 1982 .
In November 1983 , the Saturn idea was publicized by General Motors ' Chairman Roger B. Smith and GM 's President F. James McDonald .
Twelve months later , the first Saturn demonstration vehicle was revealed .
On January 7 , 1985 , the Saturn Corporation was officially founded .
Citing full disclosure , Saturn was founded as a private , employee - owned company , by former GM leadership .
They remained private until GM bought them out , and effectively " rewrote " company history .
In the mid-1980s , GM released the Saturn Concept Car .
The car , which resembled the first Saturn SL , was not originally meant to start up a brand ; however , GM planned to release the Saturn car under one of its brands , which , at the time , were Buick , Cadillac , Chevrolet , GMC , Oldsmobile , and Pontiac .
In the late 1980s , GM changed their plan and founded Saturn as its own brand , with its first cars being the Saturn SC and Saturn SL .
Production of both Saturn vehicles started in 1990 as early 1991 model year vehicles .
The Saturn SW was later added for 1993 .
GM had plans for a sedan , a coupe , a convertible , a wagon , and even a sport utility vehicle ; however , Saturn 's first sport utility vehicle , the Vue did not appear until the 2002 model year .
and Saturn 's first convertible the Sky did not appear until the 2006 model year .
1990–2000 : "
A NEW KIND OF CAR COMPANY " Section::::1990–2000 : " A new kind of car company " .
On July 30 , 1990 , the first Saturn was built , a red 1990 Saturn SL2 .
The first Saturn dealership had opened in Memphis , Tennessee .
Saturn Corporation was launched as a " different kind of car company " , and Saturn had even had its own unique car models , and their own dealership network that was separate from the rest of GM .
Results at Saturn , however , were more doubtful than positive .
According to The Wall Street Journal , the project was too ambitious , as " everything at Saturn is new : the car , the plant , the workforce , the dealer network and the manufacturing process .
Not even Toyota , a highly successful and experienced automaker , tackles more than two new items on any single project . "
While Saturn cars proved very popular with buyers , actual sales never met the optimistic projected targets , in part because of the early 1990s recession .
It also proved cannibalistic as 41 % of Saturn buyers already owned a GM car .
Its separation from the rest of its GM parent , plus the fact that it drained $ 5 billion from other car projects , stirred discontent within GM 's other divisions .
Also , Saturn opened at considerably higher cost than the Japanese transplants ( factories that Japanese automakers established in the United States ) .
Nonetheless , the brand was immediately known for its " no haggle " prices .
The first Saturn model , the S - Series , was significantly successful .
A year later , Saturn hit the Canadian market .
In 1993 , Saturn 's 500,000th car " Carla " was built .
In May 1995 , Saturn 's 1 millionth car entered the market .
In 1996 , Saturn dealerships distributed the electric GM EV1 , the first car released under the GM marque .
In 1997 , Saturn became the first General Motors North American vehicle to be fully built with right - hand - drive on the same assembly line as the left - hand - drive vehicles ( the previous right - hand - drive GM North American vehicle were built in the countries with left - hand road rule using the knock - down kit and customized dashboard and steering components ) as it entered the Japanese market .
In January 1999 , Saturn rolled out its two millionth car .
Also in 1999 , Saturn began production of its all new L - Series for the 2000 model year .
By the time the Saturn brand was launched in Japan , however , the Japanese economy was already in a sharp decline following the 1990 collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble .
2000–2008 : MODEL EXPANSION
Section::::2000–2008 :
Model expansion .
Saturn 's first compact crossover SUV was introduced in 2001 for the 2002 model year as the VUE based on a globally used GM design .
For 2002 for the 2003 model year , Saturn had introduced the ION as a replacement for the S - Series .
In 2004 for the 2005 model year Saturn began selling the RELAY a minivan and the first Saturn based on similar models from other GM brands .
That same year , the L - Series was discontinued .
The Sky roadster was introduced in 2006 as a 2007 model .
In 2006 for the 2007 model year , the AURA midsize sedan made its way to dealerships , alongside the Outlook , a larger CUV than the Vue , and was the last year the Ion was produced .
The Ion was replaced by the European - built Astra in 2008 .
During the 2008 North American International Auto Show ( NAIAS ) , Saturn revealed its Flextreme concept vehicle , which was a rebadged Opel Flextreme .
Saturn was believed to have had a disagreement with GM and were not very accepting of the company closing .
In 2004 , GM and the United Auto Workers dissolved their unique labor contract for the Spring Hill manufacturing plant , allowing Saturn operations to be integrated with the rest of GM .
2008–2009 :
ATTEMPT TO SELL BRAND , MARKET CHANGES
Section::::2008–2009 :
Attempt to sell brand , market changes .
In US Congressional hearings on December 2 , 2008 , General Motors had announced its intentions to focus on their four core brands ( Chevrolet , Cadillac , Buick , GMC ) , with the sale , consolidation , or closure of Saturn and the remaining brands ( Pontiac , Hummer , and Saab ) .
General Motors chairman and former CEO Rick Wagoner announced during a news conference on February 17 , 2009 , that Saturn would remain in operation through the end of the planned life cycle for all Saturn products ( 2010–2011 ) .
In February 2009 , GM declared its intent to part with this brand by closing or selling the division , either to investors or to dealers , as part of restructuring plans dependent upon the receipt of a second round of government loans ( " bailout " funding ) .
It was the third such action for GM in the 21st century , following those of Oldsmobile , which ceased production in 2004 , and Pontiac , which ended production of the 2010 model year by the end of 2009 .
General Motors announced in June 2009 that it was selling the brand to Penske Automotive Group .
The arrangement was similar to the deal under which Penske distributes Daimler AG 's Smart Car in the United States .
Penske was not planning to buy the factories and would eventually have to contract other car companies to build cars sold as Saturns .
GM would have built the AURA , VUE , and Outlook for Penske for two years .
To replace GM as the brand 's manufacturer , Penske was in discussions with several global automakers , including Renault Samsung Motors of Korea , and the Renault - Nissan Alliance .
By the end of 2009 , GM closed all of its 46 Saturn dealerships in Canada , even for Saturn dealerships also selling Saab vehicles .
GM and Penske decided that they could no longer make a business case to distribute Saturn vehicles in Canada after the sale of the brand .
Saturn 's customer service , parts , and warranty operations moved to other GM dealerships in Canada .
2009
: SALE FALLS THROUGH
Section::::2009
: Sale falls through .
On September 30 , 2009 , Penske had ended its deal with General Motors .
The deal between Penske and General Motors had ended because of Penske not finding another manufacturer to buy the Saturn brand .
At one point Penske was in talks with some car manufacturers including Renault Samsung Motors and the Renault - Nissan Alliance , however talks with the Renault - Nissan Alliance had ended mainly because of the objections from the Nissan part of the alliance .
There was also another part of the deal between Penske and GM was for GM to continue to make the AURA , the Outlook , and the VUE until 2011 , and then another manufacturer would take over , but since Penske did n't find another car manufacturer that was willing to continue production of Saturn vehicles , the deal between Penske and GM had ended .
As a result of this , General Motors had announced that the Saturn brand will be discontinued in 2010 , and that all Saturn dealerships will be closed by October 31 , 2010 or until all of their inventory was sold .
In February 2010 , as a means of customer retention , GM announced it was offering existing Saturn owners up to US$ 2,000 in incentives on purchasing a new Chevrolet , Cadillac , Buick or GMC vehicle until March 31 .
Customers were required to have owned their Saturns for at least six months and were not required to trade them in to be eligible for the incentives .
Saturn Authorized Service Providers have been introduced since the closing of the Saturn brand .
Most Saturn Authorized Service Providers are at Chevrolet and Cadillac dealers .
Saturn Authorized Service Providers are responsible for all aspects of service , including warranty service , on Saturn vehicles .
Saturn 's last vehicle models were the AURA , the Outlook , the Sky , and the VUE .
GM had continued to produce the AURA , the Outlook , the Sky , and the VUE into the 2010 model year .
The 2010 model year Saturn models were sold only to rental car companies .
All sales of new Saturn vehicles had ended in 2009 however .
In 2012 , General Motors had reintroduced the discontinued Saturn VUE as the 2012 Chevrolet Captiva Sport .
The Chevrolet Captiva Sport was mostly unchanged from the discontinued Saturn VUE .
However , the Captiva Sport did not have a hybrid version available , when the VUE did .
MODELS EARLIER MODELS Section::::Models .
Section::::Earlier models .
Originally , the company 's products used a dedicated platform called the Z - body and a dedicated engine , the 1.9 L Saturn I4 engine , and a dedicated plant in Spring Hill , Tennessee .
All of the original Saturns featured dent - resistant plastic body panels which were also touted as allowing the company to change the look of the vehicles readily .
However , in practice , the company did not often take advantage of this capability .
The Saturn S - Series family of cars were produced from 1991–2002 .
S - Series cars had three generations : First generation cars were produced from 1991–1995 .
For the 1995 model year Saturn used a " first generation " exterior and " second generation " interior .
The exterior of the 1995 model looked the same as the first generation cars , but it had larger gauge faces on the instrument cluster and a redesigned center console .
First generation engines were rated at for the single overhead cam engines , while the dual overhead cam engines were rated at for the entire run of S - Series cars ( 1991–2002 ) .
In 1996 , the second generation S - Series sedan was introduced .
Changes that carried through until 1999 included a redesigned body and single overhead cam power being increased to .
The third generation sedan received only minor design changes for the 2000 - 2002 production run .
Most notably , the exterior body panels were updated once again , and new paint colors were offered .
The sedan retained many of the same mechanical components with an updated interior design .
In 1997 , the second generation of the sport coupe model was introduced with a more scooped headlight front .
The 1999 Coupe models received a suicide door behind the driver side door .
The S - Series was produced in three variations : Coupe ( SC ) , Sedan ( SL ) , and Wagon ( SW ) .
The wagon was introduced for the 1993 Model year and it was produced until 2001 .
The first significant change came with the 2000 Saturn L - Series mid - size car .
It shared the GM2900 platform with the Opel Vectra , along with its engine .
It was built at a GM factory in Wilmington , Delaware .
The 2000 model year were designated LS-1 ( 4 cylinder ) and LS-2 ( 6 cylinder . )
However , as Lincoln - Mercury owned the LS designator , and to prevent a lawsuit , Saturn changed the designators to L200 & L300 for the model years 2001 - 2005 .
The Saturn L200 was discontinued after the 2003 model year .
In 2003 , the Saturn ION replaced the S - Series compact .
The production of the Saturn ION was temporarily stopped for three weeks in 2003 due to Saturn dealerships having a large amount of ION vehicles .
The Saturn L - Series was discontinued after the 2005 model year due to poor sales .
FINAL MODEL LINE Section::::Final model line .
In 2007 , the two final Saturn models with plastic body panels were the VUE and ION .
The plastic body panels were discontinued on all Saturn models after the 2007 model year .
None of the 2008 Saturn models used plastic body panels .
The 2009 Saturn models were the Sky roadster , the AURA sedan , the Astra hatchback , the VUE small crossover SUV and the Outlook full - size crossover SUV built off the GM Lambda platform .
Some of the final Saturns were virtually identical to certain European Opel / Vauxhall models .
For example , the 2008 Saturn VUE was a rebadged Opel Antara , while the Opel GT was based on the Saturn Sky .
The Saturn Astra was a rebadged version of the Opel Astra .
The Saturn Astra was also the first Saturn to be built outside of North America .
The Saturn Astra was built in Antwerp , Belgium .
Saturn had featured two sub - lines of their vehicles : the Green Line and the Red Line .
The Green Line Saturn models were environmentally friendly mild hybrid vehicles , and the Red Line Saturn models were high - performance and sporty vehicles .
