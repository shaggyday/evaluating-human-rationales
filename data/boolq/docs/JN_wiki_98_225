NOT INCLUDED IN THIS LIST Section::::Ties not included in this list .
This list does not includes events where two bronze medals are awarded due to repechage or the non - existence of a bronze - medal playoffrowing event at the 1900 Olympics , men 's coxed four .
This was due to a controversy about which boats should advance to the final ; thus two separate finals were held , awarding two sets of medals for the same event , both which are considered Olympic championships by the International Olympic Committee .
Similarly , two finals were held for some sailing events at the 1900 Olympics , namely 0 to .5 ton , .5 to 1 ton , 1 to 2 ton , 2 to 3 ton and 3 to 10 ton .
