LIST OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE WON ACADEMY , EMMY , GRAMMY , AND TONY
AWARDS
Fifteen people have won all four major annual American entertainment awards in a competitive , individual ( non - group ) category of the Emmy , Grammy , Oscar , and Tony ( EGOT ) Awards .
Respectively , these awards honor outstanding achievements in television , recording , film , and theater .
Winning all four awards has been referred to as winning the " grand slam " of American show business .
The EGOT acronym was coined by actor Philip Michael Thomas in late 1984 , when his role on the new hit show Miami Vice brought instant fame , gregariously stating a desire to complete his own EGOT - winning collection .
When coining the acronym , Thomas stated that it also means " energy , growth , opportunity and talent " .
However , he also intended that the " E " should only stand for the Primetime Emmy Award , and not a Daytime Emmy nor any of the awards presented at the other types of Emmy ceremonies .
Nevertheless , two of 15 people listed as EGOT winners have won only the Daytime Emmy . , no EGOT winner has actually won the awards in the acronym 's order ( first an Emmy , then a Grammy , then an Oscar , and finally a Tony ) , nor have they won each award to complete the EGOT before winning another ( e.g. Audrey Hepburn , who won her awards in OTTETOG order ) .
The closest person has been Robert Lopez , who won the " grand slam " in TEGO order .
