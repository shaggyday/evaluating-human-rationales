LOS ANGELES LAKERS
The Los Angeles Lakers are an American professional basketball team based in Los Angeles .
The Lakers compete in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) , as a member of the league 's Western Conference in the Pacific Division .
The Lakers play their home games at Staples Center , an arena shared with the NBA 's Los Angeles Clippers , the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women 's National Basketball Association , and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League .
The Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA , and have won 16 NBA championships , the second - most behind the Boston Celtics .
The franchise began with the 1947 purchase of a disbanded team , the Detroit Gems of the National Basketball League ( NBL ) .
The new team began playing in Minneapolis , calling themselves the Minneapolis Lakers .
Initially a member of the NBL , the Lakers won the 1948 NBL championship before joining the rival Basketball Association of America , where they would win five of the next six championships , led by star George Mikan .
After struggling financially in the late 1950s following Mikan 's retirement , they relocated to Los Angeles before the 1960–61 season .
Led by Hall of Famers Elgin Baylor and Jerry West , Los Angeles made the NBA Finals six times in the 1960s , but lost each series to the Celtics , beginning their long and storied rivalry .
In 1968 , the Lakers acquired four - time NBA Most Valuable Player ( MVP )
Wilt Chamberlain , and won their sixth NBA title — and first in Los Angeles — in 1972 , led by new head coach Bill Sharman .
After the retirement of West and Chamberlain , the team acquired Kareem Abdul - Jabbar , who also won multiple MVP awards , but was unable to make the Finals in the late 1970s .
The 1980s Lakers were nicknamed " Showtime " due to their fast break - offense led by Magic Johnson .
The team won five championships in a nine - year span , and contained Hall of Famers Johnson , Abdul - Jabbar , and James Worthy , and was led by Hall of Fame coach Pat Riley .
After Abdul - Jabbar and Johnson retired , the team struggled in the early 1990s , before acquiring Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in 1996 .
With the duo , who were led by another Hall of Fame coach in Phil Jackson , the team won three consecutive titles between 2000 to 2002 , securing the franchise its second " three - peat " .
The Lakers won two more championships in 2009 and 2010 , but failed to regain their former glory in the following decade .
The Lakers hold the record for NBA 's longest winning streak , 33 straight games , set during the 1971–72 season .
21 Hall of Famers have played for Los Angeles , while four have coached the team .
Four Lakers — Abdul - Jabbar , Johnson , O'Neal , and Bryant — have won the NBA MVP Award for a total of eight awards .

The Lakers ' franchise began in 1947 when Ben Berger and Morris Chalfen of Minnesota purchased the recently disbanded Detroit Gems of the National Basketball League ( NBL ) for $ 15,000 from Gems owner Maury Winston .
Minneapolis sportswriter Sid Hartman played a key behind the scenes role in helping put together the deal and later the team .
Inspired by Minnesota 's nickname , " Land of 10,000 Lakes " , the team christened themselves the Lakers .
Hartman helped them hire John Kundla from College of St. Thomas , to be their first head coach , by meeting with him and selling him on the team .
The Lakers had a solid roster , which featured forward Jim Pollard , playmaker Herm Schaefer , and center George Mikan , who became the most dominant player in the NBL .
In their first season , they led the league with a 43–17 record , later winning the NBL Championship that season .
In 1948 , the Lakers moved from the NBL to the Basketball Association of America ( BAA ) , and Mikan 's 28.3 point per game ( ppg ) scoring average set a BAA record .

Trailing the Golden State Warriors by three games with seven left to play , the Lakers rallied to finish 47–35 and win the Pacific Division .
They made the playoffs but managed just one win against Milwaukee in the conference semifinals .
Following the season , West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke , and filed a suit for unpaid back wages .
After missing the playoffs in the 1974–75 season , the Lakers acquired Kareem Abdul - Jabbar , who had won three league MVP 's by that time .

" SHOWTIME " Section::::1979–1991 : " Showtime " .
In the 1979 NBA draft , Los Angeles selected point guard Magic Johnson from Michigan State with the first overall pick .

Once they adjusted , his passing became a key part of Los Angeles ' offense .
The Lakers won 60 games in Johnson 's rookie year , and defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in six games in the 1980 NBA Finals .
Johnson won the Finals MVP award , after starting at center for the injured Abdul - Jabbar in game six , and tallying 42 points , 15 rebounds , and seven assists .

Following the season , 1987 Defensive Player of the Year winner Michael Cooper decided to play in Europe and was waived at his request .

Berger and Chalfen purchased the NBL 's disbanded Detroit Gems for $ 15,000 in 1947 , changed their name to the Lakers and relocated them to Minnesota .
Max Winter bought a third of the club in their early years , and sold his share to Mikan in 1954 .
Berger bought Mikan 's share in 1956 giving him a controlling ( ⅔ ) interest .
After Mikan retired , attendance plummeted and the team lost money for several seasons , leading the ownership group to put the team up for sale in 1957 .
Marty Marion , a retired baseball player and manager , and his business partner Milton Fischman attempted to purchase the team with the intention of moving the club to Kansas City , Missouri .
Mikan offered to mortgage his home in an attempt to buy the team and keep the club in Minnesota .
The Lakers were sold to a group of investors led by Bob Short however .
The team was sold to Short 's group with the agreement that it would not be relocated to Kansas City but kept in Minnesota .
Short 's ownership group consisted of 117 Minnesota businesses and private citizens , who amassed a total of $ 200,000 for the purchase ; $ 150,000 to buy the team and $ 50,000 to run it .
By 1958 Short had become 80 % owner of the team by buying out his partners , but the team was floundering .
Attendance remained poor , and the NBA had put the Lakers on " financial probation " , notifying them that if they did not meet certain ticket sales numbers they could be bought out by the league and relocated .
Short was forced to move the team to Los Angeles in 1960 ; the club had lost $ 60,000 in the first half of the 1959–60 season alone .
The NBA 's owners originally voted 7–1 against the move .
When Short indicated that he might take the team to new rival league that was developing however , the owners held another vote that same day and allowed the relocation ( 8–0 ) .
Aided by Baylor 's drawing power , and the new locale , the team 's finances improved when they arrived in LA .
Short sold the team to Washington Redskins owner and publisher Jack Kent Cooke in 1965 for a then league record amount of $ 5,175,000 .
Short insisted the deal be conducted in cash as he was wary of Cooke , so guards transported the money in a cart from one New York bank to another .
Cooke was a more hands - on owner than Short , and overhauled the team 's operations .
He personally financed construction of the Forum in 1967 at a cost of $ 16.5 million .
He owned the team until 1979 when he sold it , the NHL 's Los Angeles Kings , the Forum , and some real estate to Jerry Buss for $ 67 million .
Cooke was forced to sell the team as he was undergoing a costly divorce .
Buss was a local chemical engineer and former University of Southern California professor who had become wealthy in real estate .
Philip Anschutz bought a stake in the team in 1998 , and until October 2010 Magic Johnson was a minority owner as well .
Buss started the trend of allowing sponsors to add their name to team 's stadiums when he renamed the Forum the Great Western Forum in 1988 .
In 2009 major sponsors included Verizon Wireless , Toyota , Anheuser - Busch , American Express , and Carl 's Jr. , and the team 's $ 113 average ticket price was the highest in the league .
Fast food chain Jack in the Box is another major sponsor , the company gives all fans in attendance at home games a coupon for two free tacos if the Lakers hold their opponent under 100 points and win .
The company also sponsors the team 's halftime shows on KCAL - TV and Fox Sports West .
In 2013 , Buss died at the age of 80 after being hospitalized for 18 months with cancer .
His controlling ownership of the team passed to his six children via a trust , with each child receiving an equal vote .
Buss ' succession plan had daughter Jeanie Buss assume his title as the Lakers ' governor as well as its team representative at NBA Board of Governors meetings .
Given the team 's proximity to Hollywood , the Lakers fanbase includes numerous celebrities , many of whom can be seen at the Staples Center during home games .
Jack Nicholson , for example , has held season tickets since the 1970s , and directors reportedly need to work their shooting schedules around Lakers home games .
From 2002 and 2007 the team averaged just over 18,900 fans , which placed them in the top ten in the NBA in attendance .
Red Hot Chili Peppers ' song " Magic Johnson " from their 1989 album Mother 's Milk is a tribute to the former point guard , and frontman Anthony Kiedis and bassist Michael " Flea " Balzary are frequently seen attending home games .
