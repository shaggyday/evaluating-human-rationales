HISTORY Section::::History .
PepsiCo began test - marketing potential lemon - lime sodas in 1998 , introducing a formulation known as Storm that never made it past the test - marketing stage .
Prior lemon - lime sodas from PepsiCo included Teem , which had been introduced in 1960 but discontinued in 1984 , when they introduced the Slice line of fruit - flavored sodas , which launched with a lemon - lime flavor .
The company introduced Sierra Mist in 1999 .
The selection of the name " Sierra Mist " was based on favorable market research involving 2,000 people from over 1,000 possible names .
" Sierra " had previously been a proposed name for what became the original ( 10 % juice - formula , lemon - lime ) Slice in 1984 .
Diet Sierra Mist was also introduced in 2000 , and sales of both diet and original Sierra Mist totaled $ 100 million in its first year of production .
Many PepsiCo bottlers continued to bottle 7 Up until existing agreements with Cadbury Schweppes expired in January 2003 , at which point its distribution was expanded nationwide in the U.S.
In 2004 the beverage had surpassed 7 Up on the basis of annual retail sales , placing it as the 2nd most - purchased lemon - lime soft drink in the U.S. ( Sprite being the 1st ) .
In 2005 , Diet Sierra Mist was renamed Sierra Mist Free , intended as a descriptor of the beverage being " free of " sugar , calories , carbohydrates and caffeine .
This name change was reverted to the original name , Diet Sierra Mist , in November 2008 .
In late 2006 , PepsiCo introduced Sierra Mist Cranberry Splash .
It was available only during the Winter holiday season .
Cranberry Splash returned in the fall and winter of 2007 , 2008 , 2009 , 2010 along with Diet Sierra Mist Cranberry Splash .
In May 2007 , Sierra Mist Lemon Squeeze was introduced .
This limited edition featured a higher concentration of lemon flavor and was only available through September 2007 .
Sierra Mist can and bottle labels were redesigned as a part of PepsiCo 's broader redesign of its core carbonated soft drink brands in 2008 , with Sierra Mist Free reverting to the Diet Sierra Mist name in the process .
The Sierra Mist logo was later redesigned again in March 2010 with a typeface similar to that of the current Pepsi design .
Sierra Mist underwent a more significant rebranding in August 2010 , in response to shifting consumer preferences towards products made with " natural " ingredients â€“ according to beverage industry and general news media reporting at the time .
On August 29 , 2010 , Sierra Mist was replaced with Sierra Mist Natural , although the original Sierra Mist still remained stocked in markets until late 2010 .
Updated logos , bottle labeling and can designs were also implemented at the same time .
At this time , the Sierra Mist drink was reformulated , sweetened with sucrose instead of high - fructose corn syrup .
In Fall 2014 , Stevia was added as an adjunctive sweetener .
On December 18 , 2015 , Pepsi announced that the name of Sierra Mist would be changing to Mist Twst at an unknown point in spring 2016 , in line with Pepsico 's sponsorship agreement with the NBA , which replaced Coca - Cola 's previous sponsorship and its broad campaign with the league for Sprite .
The name change was officially made in late March 2016 .
In Summer 2018 , the Mist Twst brand reverted to Sierra Mist .

By 2013 , Sierra Mist Natural reverted in name to simply Sierra Mist , and in 2014 the formulation was changed to use a combination of sucrose and stevia as sweeteners , in an effort to cut calories in drinks .
