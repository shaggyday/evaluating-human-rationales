CONJUNCTIVITIS Conjunctivitis , also known as pink eye , is inflammation of the outermost layer of the white part of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelid .
It makes the eye appear pink or reddish .
Pain , burning , scratchiness , or itchiness may occur .
The affected eye may have increased tears or be " stuck shut " in the morning .
Swelling of the white part of the eye may also occur .
Itching is more common in cases due to allergies .
Conjunctivitis can affect one or both eyes .
The most common infectious causes are viral followed by bacterial .
The viral infection may occur along with other symptoms of a common cold .
Both viral and bacterial cases are easily spread between people .
Allergies to pollen or animal hair are also a common cause .
Diagnosis is often based on signs and symptoms .
Occasionally , a sample of the discharge is sent for culture .
Prevention is partly by handwashing .
Treatment depends on the underlying cause .
In the majority of viral cases , there is no specific treatment .
Most cases due to a bacterial infection also resolve without treatment ; however , antibiotics can shorten the illness .
People who wear contact lenses and those whose infection is caused by gonorrhea or chlamydia should be treated .
Allergic cases can be treated with antihistamines or mast cell inhibitor drops .
About 3 to 6 million people get conjunctivitis each year in the United States .
In adults , viral causes are more common , while in children , bacterial causes are more common .
Typically , people get better in one or two weeks .
If visual loss , significant pain , sensitivity to light , signs of herpes , or if symptoms do not improve after a week , further diagnosis and treatment may be required .
Conjunctivitis in a newborn , known as neonatal conjunctivitis , may also require specific treatment .
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Section::::Signs and symptoms .
Red eye , swelling of the conjunctiva , and watering of the eyes are symptoms common to all forms of conjunctivitis .
However , the pupils should be normally reactive , and the visual acuity normal .
Conjunctivitis is identified by irritation and redness of the conjunctiva .
Except in obvious pyogenic or toxic / chemical conjunctivitis , a slit lamp ( biomicroscope ) is needed to confirm the diagnosis .
Examination of the eyelid conjunctiva is usually more diagnostic than examination of the scleral conjunctiva .
VIRAL
Section::::Viral .
Viral conjunctivitis is often associated with an infection of the upper respiratory tract , a common cold , or a sore throat .
Its symptoms include excessive watering and itching .
The infection usually begins in one eye , but may spread easily to the other eye .
Viral conjunctivitis manifests as a fine , diffuse pinkness of the conjunctiva , which is easily mistaken for a ciliary infection of the iris ( iritis ) , but corroborative signs on microscopy , particularly numerous lymphoid follicles on the tarsal conjunctiva , and sometimes a punctate keratitis are seen .
ALLERGIC Section::::Allergic .
Allergic conjunctivitis is inflammation of the conjunctiva due to allergy .
The specific allergens may differ among patients .
Symptoms result from the release of histamine and other active substances by mast cells , and consist of redness ( mainly due to vasodilation of the peripheral small blood vessels ) , swelling of the conjunctiva , itching , and increased production of tears .
BACTERIAL
Section::::Bacterial .
Bacterial conjunctivitis causes the rapid onset of conjunctival redness , swelling of the eyelid , and a sticky discharge .
Typically , symptoms develop first in one eye , but may spread to the other eye within 2–5 days .
Conjunctivitis due to common pus - producing bacteria causes marked grittiness or irritation and a stringy , opaque , greyish or yellowish discharge that may cause the lids to stick together , especially after sleep .
Severe crusting of the infected eye and the surrounding skin may also occur .
The gritty or scratchy feeling is sometimes localized enough that patients may insist that they have a foreign body in the eye .
Common bacteria responsible for nonacute bacterial conjunctivitis are Staphylococcus , Streptococcus , and Haemophilus species .
Less commonly , Chlamydia spp . may be the cause .
Bacteria such as Chlamydia trachomatis or Moraxella spp .
can cause a nonexudative but persistent conjunctivitis without much redness .
Bacterial conjunctivitis may cause the production of membranes or pseudomembranes that cover the conjunctiva .
Pseudomembranes consist of a combination of inflammatory cells and exudates and adhere loosely to the conjunctiva , while true membranes are more tightly adherent and can not be easily peeled away .
Cases of bacterial conjunctivitis that involve the production of membranes or pseudomembranes are associated with Neisseria gonorrhoeae , β - hemolytic streptococci , and Corynebacterium diphtheriae .
C. diphtheriae causes membrane formation in conjunctiva of unimmunized children .
CHEMICAL
Section::::Chemical .
Chemical eye injury may result when an acidic or alkaline substance gets in the eye .
Alkali burns are typically worse than acidic burns .
Mild burns produce conjunctivitis , while more severe burns may cause the cornea to turn white .
Litmus paper may be used to test for chemical causes .
When a chemical cause has been confirmed , the eye or eyes should be flushed until the pH is in the range 6—8 .
Anaesthetic eye drops can be used to decrease the pain .
Irritant or toxic conjunctivitis is primarily marked by redness .
If due to a chemical splash , it is often present in only the lower conjunctival sac .
With some chemicals , above all with caustic alkalis such as sodium hydroxide , necrosis of the conjunctiva marked by a deceptively white eye due to vascular closure may occur , followed by sloughing off of the dead epithelium .
A slit lamp examination is likely to show evidence of anterior uveitis .
OTHER Section::::Other .
Inclusion conjunctivitis of the newborn is a conjunctivitis that may be caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis , and may lead to acute , purulent conjunctivitis .
However , it is usually self - healing .
CAUSES Section::::Causes .
Infective conjunctivitis is most commonly caused by a virus .
Bacterial infections , allergies , other irritants , and dryness are also common causes .
Both bacterial and viral infections are contagious , passing from person to person or spread through contaminated objects or water .
Contact with contaminated fingers is a common cause of conjunctivitis .
Bacteria may also reach the conjunctiva from the edges of the eyelids and the surrounding skin , from the nasopharynx , from infected eye drops or contact lenses , from the genitals or the bloodstream .
Infection by human adenovirus accounts for 65 % to 90 % of cases of viral conjunctivitis .
VIRAL
Section::::Viral .
Adenoviruses are the most common cause of viral conjunctivitis ( adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis ) .
Herpetic keratoconjunctivitis , caused by herpes simplex viruses , can be serious and requires treatment with aciclovir .
Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is a highly contagious disease caused by one of two enteroviruses , enterovirus 70 and coxsackievirus A24 .
These were first identified in an outbreak in Ghana in 1969 , and have spread worldwide since then , causing several epidemics .
BACTERIAL
Section::::Bacterial .
The most common causes of acute bacterial conjunctivitis are Staphylococcus aureus , Streptococcus pneumoniae , and Haemophilus influenzae .
Though very rare , hyperacute cases are usually caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Neisseria meningitidis .
Chronic cases of bacterial conjunctivitis are those lasting longer than 3 weeks , and are typically caused by S. aureus , Moraxella lacunata , or Gram - negative enteric flora .
ALLERGIC Section::::Allergic .
Conjunctivitis may also be caused by allergens such as pollen , perfumes , cosmetics , smoke , dust mites , Balsam of Peru , or eye drops .
The most frequent cause of conjunctivitis is allergic conjunctivitis and it affects 15 % to 40 % of the population .
Allergic conjunctivitis accounts for 15 % of eye related primary care consultations - most including seasonal exposures in the spring and summer or perpetual conditions .
OTHER Section::::Other .
Conjunctivitis is part of the triad of reactive arthritis , which is thought to be caused by autoimmune cross - reactivity following certain bacterial infections .
Reactive arthritis is highly associated with HLA - B27 .
Conjunctivitis is associated with the autoimmune disease relapsing polychondritis .
DIAGNOSIS Section::::Diagnosis .
Cultures are not often taken or needed as most cases resolve either with time or typical antibiotics .
If bacterial conjunctivitis is suspected , but no response to topical antibiotics is seen , swabs for bacterial culture should be taken and tested .
Viral culture may be appropriate in epidemic case clusters .
A patch test is used to identify the causative allergen in allergic conjunctivitis .
Although conjunctival scrapes for cytology can be useful in detecting chlamydial and fungal infections , allergy , and dysplasia , they are rarely done because of the cost and the general dearth of laboratory staff experienced in handling ocular specimens .
Conjunctival incisional biopsy is occasionally done when granulomatous diseases ( e.g. , sarcoidosis ) or dysplasia are suspected .
CLASSIFICATION Section::::Classification .
Conjunctivitis may be classified either by cause or by extent of the inflamed area .
CAUSES
* Allergy * Bacteria * Viruses
* Chemicals * Autoimmune Section::::Causes .
Neonatal conjunctivitis is often grouped separately from bacterial conjunctivitis because it is caused by different bacteria than the more common cases of bacterial conjunctivitis .
BY EXTENT OF INVOLVEMENT Section::::By
extent of involvement .
Blepharoconjunctivitis is the dual combination of conjunctivitis with blepharitis ( inflammation of the eyelids ) .
Keratoconjunctivitis is the combination of conjunctivitis and keratitis ( corneal inflammation ) .
Blepharokeratoconjunctivitis is the combination of conjunctivitis with blepharitis and keratitis .
It is clinically defined by changes of the lid margin , meibomian gland dysfunction , redness of the eye , conjunctival chemosis and inflammation of the cornea .
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Section::::Differential diagnosis .
Some more serious conditions can present with a red eye , such as infectious keratitis , angle - closure glaucoma , or iritis .
These conditions require the urgent attention of an ophthalmologist .
Signs of such conditions include decreased vision , significantly increased sensitivity to light , inability to keep the eye open , a pupil that does not respond to light , or a severe headache with nausea .
Fluctuating blurring is common , due to tearing and mucoid discharge .
Mild photophobia is common .
However , if any of these symptoms is prominent , considering other diseases such as glaucoma , uveitis , keratitis , and even meningitis or carotico - cavernous fistula is important .
A more comprehensive differential diagnosis for the red or painful eye includes : *
Corneal abrasion
* Subconjunctival hemorrhage
* Pinguecula
* Blepharitis * Dacryocystitis
*
Keratoconjunctivitis sicca ( dry eye )
* Keratitis * Herpes simplex
* Herpes zoster * Episcleritis - an inflammatory condition that produces a similar appearance to conjunctivitis , but without discharge or tearing
* Uveitis
* Acute angle - closure glaucoma * Endophthalmitis PREVENTION Section::::Prevention .
The most effective prevention is good hygiene , especially avoiding rubbing the eyes with infected hands .
Vaccination against adenovirus , Haemophilus influenzae , pneumococcus , and Neisseria meningitidis is also effective .
Povidone - iodine eye solution has been found to prevent neonatal conjunctivitis .
It is becoming more commonly used globally because of its low cost .
MANAGEMENT
Section::::Management .
Conjunctivitis resolves in 65 % of cases without treatment , within 2 - 5 days .
The prescription of antibiotics is not necessary in most cases .
VIRAL
Section::::Viral .
Viral conjunctivitis usually resolves on its own and does not require any specific treatment .
Antihistamines ( e.g. , diphenhydramine ) or mast cell stabilizers ( e.g. , cromolyn ) may be used to help with the symptoms .
Povidone - iodine has been suggested as a treatment , but as of 2008 , evidence to support it was poor .
ALLERGIC Section::::Allergic .
For allergic conjunctivitis , cool water poured over the face with the head inclined downward constricts capillaries , and artificial tears sometimes relieve discomfort in mild cases .
In more severe cases , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory medications and antihistamines may be prescribed .
Persistent allergic conjunctivitis may also require topical steroid drops .
BACTERIAL
Section::::Bacterial .
Bacterial conjunctivitis usually resolves without treatment .
Topical antibiotics may be needed only if no improvement is observed after 3 days .
No serious effects were noted either with or without treatment .
Because antibiotics do speed healing in bacterial conjunctivitis , their use may be considered .
Antibiotics are also recommended for those who wear contact lenses , are immunocompromised , have disease which is thought to be due to chlamydia or gonorrhea , have a fair bit of pain , or have copious discharge .
Gonorrheal or chlamydial infections require both oral and topical antibiotics .
The choice of antibiotic varies based on the strain or suspected strain of bacteria causing the infection .
Fluoroquinolones , sodium sulfacetamide , or trimethoprim / polymyxin may be used , typically for 7–10 days .
Cases of meningococcal conjunctivitis can also be treated with systemic penicillin , as long as the strain is sensitive to penicillin .
When investigated as a treatment , povidone - iodine ophthalmic solution has also been observed to have some effectiveness against bacterial and chlamydial conjunctivitis , with a possible role suggested in locations where topical antibiotics are unavailable or costly .
CHEMICAL
Section::::Chemical .
Conjunctivitis due to chemicals is treated via irrigation with Ringer 's lactate or saline solution .
Chemical injuries , particularly alkali burns , are medical emergencies , as they can lead to severe scarring and intraocular damage .
People with chemically induced conjunctivitis should not touch their eyes to avoid spreading the chemical .
EPIDEMIOLOGY Section::::Epidemiology .
Conjunctivitis is the most common eye disease .
Rates of disease is related to the underlying cause which varies by the age as well as the time of year .
Acute conjunctivitis is most frequently found in infants , school - age children and the elderly .
The most common cause of infectious conjunctivitis is viral conjunctivitis .
It is estimated that acute conjunctivitis affects 6 million people annually in the United States .
Some seasonal trends have been observed for the occurrence of different forms of conjunctivitis .
The occurrence of bacterial conjunctivitis peaks from December to April , viral conjunctivitis peaks in the summer months and allergic conjunctivitis is more prevalent throughout the spring and summer .
HISTORY Section::::History .
An adenovirus was first isolated by Rowe et al .
in 1953 .
Two years later , Jawetz et al .
published on epidemic keratoconjunctivitis .
"
Madras eye " is a colloquial term that has been used in India for the disease .
SOCIETY AND CULTURE Section::::Society and culture .
Conjunctivitis imposes economic and social burdens .
The cost of treating bacterial conjunctivitis alone was estimated to be $ 377 million to $ 857 million per year .
Approximately 1 % of all primary care office visits in the United States are related to conjunctivitis .
Approximately 70 % of all people with acute conjunctivitis present to primary care and urgent care .
