FIRST GENERATION ( 2003–2008 )
SPECIFICATIONS Section::::First generation ( 2003–2008 ) .
Section::::Specifications .
The 2003 - 2004 Pilots featured the J35A4 engine , an all - aluminum 3.5L V6 SOHC with VTEC , producing 240 HP and 242 lb - ft of torque .
The 2005 Pilot received a new engine , the J35A6 , which added drive - by - wire throttle and produced 255 HP and 250 lb - ft of torque .
Other changes included the transmission with revised 4th and 5th gear ratios providing a smoother transition between gears , along with a new fuel tank design , increasing the Pilot 's driving range by over 40 miles .
All Pilots from 2003 - 2005 feature VTM-4 , Honda 's four - wheel drive system .
The Pilot received more updates starting with the 2006 model year , engines were either the J35Z1 ( FWD ) or the J35A9 ( 4WD ) .
Both engines were rated at 244 HP and 240 lb - ft of torque ; the power reduction is because Honda used the updated SAE net power standard .
This was the first time 4WD was not standard on the Pilot .
The new FWD models featured Honda 's Variable Cylinder Management ( VCM ) system , which can deactivate up to three cylinders under light load to increase fuel economy , to help control noise from the system Honda added Active Control Engine Mount System ( ACM ) and Active Noise Cancellation ( ANC ) .
Further this version of the J35 featured updated iVTEC and
the automatic transmission a shorter 1st gear ratio . With powertrain updates and the lack of VTM-4 the FWD version
had improved fuel economy of 18-city/24-highway , an increase of +1/+2 mpg versus the 4WD .
All Pilots from this generation feature a 5-speed automatic transmission .
The Pilot has front struts with a coil - spring , multilink rear suspension for a flat rear load floor .
Front track is 66.3 in ( 1,684 mm ) and 66.5 in ( 1,689 mm ) at the rear .
The Pilot has a 4,500 lb ( 2,041 kg )
boat/3,500 lb ( 1,588 kg ) trailer towing capability with the optional dealer installed towing package .
Pilots with Honda 's Variable Torque Management 4WD system ( VTM-4 ) sent most power to the front wheels under normal driving conditions .
Under acceleration or if wheel slippage is detected at the front wheels , up to 50 % of power can be sent to the rear wheels .
The also system features a VTM-4 lock button on the dashboard which locks the rear differential and sends 25 % of the power to each rear wheel .
However , the VTM-4 lock function only operates in first gear , second gear and reverse , and automatically disengages above 18 mph , then re - engages when the speed drops below 18 mph .
DESIGN Section::::Design .
Design of the Pilot was by Honda 's Ricky Hsu through 1999 , when styling was approved .
The Pilot can accommodate up to eight passengers in three rows configured as stadium seating .
The third row can seat three , but the limited legroom makes it suitable only for small children or adults on short trips .
