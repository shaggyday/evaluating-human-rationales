COLLEGE STATISTICS
PROFESSIONAL CAREER
UNITED STATES FOOTBALL LEAGUE Section::::Professional career .
Section::::United States Football League .
United States Football League rules ( unlike the NFL at the time ) allowed athletes to turn professional after their junior seasons rather than wait for their collegiate class to graduate a year later .
Further , the rules allowed him to choose where to play , allowing him to maximize his endorsement income .
He stated , " I do n't know if I would want to play in the NFL unless it was for the two New York teams or the Dallas Cowboys . "
Walker signed with the New Jersey Generals in 1983 , owned by Oklahoma oil tycoon J. Walter Duncan , who after the 1983 season sold the team to real - estate mogul and future President of the United States Donald Trump .
Walker attracted only one major promotional offer , a joint project of McDonald 's and Adidas .
The USFL had initially followed the NFL and banned underclassmen .
However , league officials concluded the rule would never stand up in court , and discarded it .
To circumvent the league 's $ 1.8-million salary cap , Walker signed a personal services contract with Duncan ( later transferred to Donald Trump ) .
Similar arrangements were later made with other college stars .
Although this move was challenged in court , Walker and the USFL prevailed .
Walker won the USFL rushing title in 1983 and 1985 .
He set the professional football record for single - season rushing yards with 2,411 yards in 1985 , averaging 5.50 yards per attempt in 18 games .
Over the course of his USFL career , Walker had 5,562 yards rushing in 1,143 carries , averaging 4.87 yards .
In 1983 , he rushed for 1,812 yards in 18 games .
In his second season , his rushing yardage dropped to 1,339 , but he caught passes for more than 800 yards giving him over 2,100 yards in total offense .
STATISTICS NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE DALLAS COWBOYS ( FIRST STINT ) Section::::National Football League .
Section::::Dallas Cowboys ( first stint ) .
The Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League , suspecting that the United States Football League ( USFL ) was not going to last , acquired Walker 's NFL rights by selecting him in the fifth round ( 114th overall ) of the 1985 NFL Draft .
The USFL eventually succumbed after its technically successful but financially fruitless antitrust suit against the NFL .
In 1986 , he was signed by the Cowboys and moved to fullback , so he could share backfield duties with Tony Dorsett , becoming the second Heisman backfield tandem in NFL history , after George Rogers and Earl Campbell teamed with the 1984 New Orleans Saints .
This move created tension , as it would limit Dorsett 's playing time , and because Walker 's $ 5 million five - year contract exceeded his $ 4.5 million five - year contract .
Walker rushed for the game - winning touchdown with a minute to play in the 31 - 28 victory against the New York Giants in the season opener .
In the week 15 game against the Philadelphia Eagles , he had a franchise - record 292 yards of total offense , including the NFL 's longest run of the year with an 84-yarder for a touchdown and an 84-yard touchdown reception .
In 1987 , Walker complained with Cowboys management that he was being moved around between three different positions ( running back , fullback , wide receiver ) and that Dorsett had more carries .
He would take over as the team 's main running back , playing in 12 games ( 11 starts ) , while registering 891 rushing yards , 715 receiving yards , and 8 touchdowns .
Dorsett played in 12 games ( 6 starts ) and had two healthy DNP ( Did Not Play ) , which would make him demand a trade that would send him to the Denver Broncos .
Walker established himself as a premier NFL running back in 1988 , becoming a one - man offense , reaching his NFL career highs of 1,514 rushing yards and 505 receiving yards , while playing seven positions : halfback , fullback , tight end , H - back , wide receiver , both in the slot and as a flanker .
He became just the 10th player in NFL history to amass more than 2,000 combined rushing and receiving yards in a season .
In the process he achieved two consecutive Pro Bowls ( 1987 and 1988 ) .
In 1989 , at the height of his NFL career , the Cowboys traded Walker to the Minnesota Vikings for a total of five players ( linebacker Jesse Solomon , defensive back Issiac Holt , running back Darrin Nelson , linebacker David Howard , defensive end Alex Stewart ) and six future draft picks .
The five players were tied to potential draft picks Minnesota would give Dallas if a player was cut ( which led to Emmitt Smith , Russell Maryland , Kevin Smith , and Darren Woodson ) .
This was claimed to be a turning point in the rise of the Cowboys to the NFL 's top echelon .
MINNESOTA VIKINGS Section::::Minnesota Vikings .
Nicknamed the " HWT " ( Herschel Walker trade ) , Walker 's trade to Minnesota was initially considered by many as supplying the Vikings with the " missing piece " for a Super Bowl run , however , over time , as the Cowboys ' fortunes soared and the Vikings ' waned , it became viewed as , perhaps , the most lopsided trade in NFL history .
From the moment he arrived in Minneapolis , " Herschel Mania " erupted .
After a single 2½ hour practice where he studied only 12 offensive plays , Walker had an incredible debut against the Green Bay Packers .
He produced the best rushing game by a Viking back since 1983 and the first over-100 yard rushing performance by a Viking since 1987 , gaining 148 yards on 18 carries .
He received three standing ovations from the record Metrodome crowd of 62,075 , producing a Vikings win after four successive losses and 14 of the prior 18 matches with the Packers .
However , his production thereafter declined .
The problem was that the Vikings refused to make Walker the centerpiece of their offense and Walker could n't use his custom tailored running scheme made by Dallas ; which was power running between the tackles from the I - formation with a blocking fullback in front of him , to save the Vikings .
Instead of looking at their own schemes , the team questioned his talent and commitment to football .
He joined the bobsled program of the United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation , earning a berth in the 1992 Winter Olympics .
Scout.com says , " Walker was never used properly by the coaching brain trust . "
" Herschel the Turkey " , a mock honor given out by the Star Tribune newspaper to inept Minnesota sports personalities , is named for him .
Walker played for the Vikings for two and a half years .
PHILADELPHIA
EAGLES Section::::Philadelphia Eagles .
After three seasons in Minnesota , the Philadelphia Eagles signed Walker in 1992 hoping he would be the final ingredient they needed to reach the Super Bowl .
That year , he enjoyed his best season as a Pro since 1988 , rushing for 1,070 yards .
In 1994 he became the first NFL player to have one - play gains of 90 or more yards rushing , receiving and kick - returning in a single season .
He spent three seasons in Philadelphia , leaving after the Eagles signed free agent Ricky Watters .
NEW YORK GIANTS Section::::New York Giants .
The New York Giants signed Walker in 1995 to a three - year contract worth $ 4.8 million as a third - down back , but soon discovered that Walker was n't elusive enough for the role .
He could n't play fullback either , because of limited blocking skills .
Walker led the Giants with 45 kick returns at 21.5 yards per return in 1995 , his only season with the team .
DALLAS COWBOYS ( SECOND STINT )
Section::::Dallas Cowboys ( second stint ) .
Walker finished his football career with the team that he started his NFL career with , the Cowboys .
In 1996 , he rejoined the team as a kickoff return specialist and third - down back .

Walker retired at the end of the 1997 season .
