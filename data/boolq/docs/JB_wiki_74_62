In 2015 the Wyoming chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) gathered signatures to place legal medical marijuana on the 2016 election ballot as a ballot initiative .
Wyoming has some of the most stringent ballot initiative requirements in the country , due to which the state has not seen a public initiative reach the ballot since 1991 .
In 2016 , legislation in the Wyoming House of Representatives to decriminalize possession of an ounce or less of marijuana ( sponsored by State Representative James Byrd of Cheyenne ) failed for the third year in a row .
In 2017 , supporters sought 25,000 signatures to put the Peggy A. Kelley Wyoming Cannabis Act of 2016 on the 2018 ballot as a public initiative , but failed to gather the required signatures by the 14 February deadline .
POLLING
Section::::Polling .
An October 2014 poll of Wyoming residents conducted by the University of Wyoming found that 35 % supported legalizing the use of marijuana by adults , while 60 % opposed such a measure .
However , a large majority favored allowing adults to use marijuana if prescribed by a physician ( 72 % support , 25 % oppose ) .
Compared to a previous survey in 2000 , the 2014 results showed a modest increase in support for legalized personal marijuana use and no change in support of medical marijuana use .
A 2016 study by the University of Wyoming showed that 81 percent of Wyoming residents supported legalizing prescribed medical cannabis .
