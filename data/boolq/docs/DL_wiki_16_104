GRIZZLY – POLAR BEAR HYBRID
A grizzly – polar bear hybrid ( also named grolar bear or pizzly bear or nanulak ) is a rare ursid hybrid that has occurred both in captivity and in the wild .
In 2006 , the occurrence of this hybrid in nature was confirmed by testing the DNA of a unique - looking bear that had been shot near Sachs Harbour , Northwest Territories on Banks Island in the Canadian Arctic .
Possible wild - bred polar bear - grizzly bear hybrids have been reported and shot in the past , but DNA tests were not available to verify the bears ' ancestry .
Analyses of DNA sequences of bears have recovered multiple instances of introgressive hybridization between various bear species , including introgression of polar bear DNA into brown bears during the Pleistocene .
OCCURRENCES IN THE WILD Section::::Occurrences in the wild .
With many suspected sightings and three confirmed cases , theories of how such hybrids might naturally occur have become more than hypothetical .
Although these two species are genetically similar and are often found in the same territories , they tend to avoid each other in the wild ( given ideal climate conditions ) .
They also fill different ecological niches .
Grizzlies ( and also Kodiak bears and " Alaskan brown bears " , which are all subspecies of the brown bear , Ursus arctos ) , tend to live and breed on land .
Polar bears prefer the water and ice , usually breeding on the ice .
The yellowish - white MacFarlane 's bear , a mysterious animal known only from one specimen acquired in 1864 , seems to attest that grizzly - polar bear hybrids may have been around for some time .
Another theory suggests that the polar bears have been driven southward by the melting of the ice cap , bringing them into closer contact with grizzly bears .
2006
DISCOVERY Section::::2006 discovery .
Jim Martell , a hunter from Idaho , found and shot a grizzly – polar bear hybrid near Sachs Harbour on Banks Island , Northwest Territories reportedly on 16 April 2006 .
Martell had been hunting for polar bears with an official license and a guide , at a cost of $ 45,450 , and killed the animal believing it to be a normal polar bear .
Officials took interest in the creature after noticing that while it had thick , creamy white fur typical of polar bears , it also had long claws , a humped back , a shallow face , and brown patches around its eyes , nose , back , and foot , which are all traits of grizzly bears .
If the bear had been adjudicated to be a grizzly , the hunter would have faced a possible CAN$1,000 fine and up to a year in jail .
A DNA test conducted by Wildlife Genetics International in British Columbia confirmed it was a hybrid , with a polar bear mother and a grizzly bear father .
It is the first documented case in the wild , though it was known that this hybrid was biologically possible and other ursid hybrids have been bred in zoos in the past .
Amidst much controversy , the bear has since been returned to Mr. Martell .
2010
DISCOVERY Section::::2010 discovery .
On 8 April 2010 , David Kuptana , an Inuvialuit hunter from the nearby community of Ulukhaktok on Victoria Island shot what he thought was a polar bear .
After inspecting the bear and having its DNA tested , it was discovered that the bear 's mother was a grizzly - polar hybrid and the father was a grizzly bear .
The Department of Environment and Natural Resources for the NWT said that it " ... may be the first recorded second - generation polar - grizzly bear hybrid found in the wild " .
The bear possesses physical characteristics intermediate between grizzlies and polar bears , such as brown fur on its paws , long claws , and a grizzly - like head .
2010 REPORT Section::::2010 report .
Biologists affiliated with the American Museum of Natural History and City College of the City University of New York have prepared a new report published in Canadian Field Naturalist that offers the first documented evidence that grizzlies are migrating into polar bear territory .
Researchers found that seven grizzlies had been spotted in Wapusk National Park south of Churchill , Manitoba , between 2003 and 2008 .
NAMING
Section::::Naming .
Since the 2006 discovery placed the hybrid into the spotlight , the media have referred to this animal with several portmanteau names , such as pizzly , grolar bear , and polizzly , but there is no consensus on the use of any one of these terms .
Canadian wildlife officials have suggested calling the hybrid " nanulak " , taken from the Inuit names for polar bear ( nanuk ) and grizzly bear ( aklak ) .
By one convention , the name of the sire comes first in such combinations : the offspring of a male polar bear and a female grizzly would be the suggested nanulak or a " pizzly bear " , while the offspring of a male grizzly and a female polar bear would be a " grolar bear " or possibly an aknuk .
If the remains of MacFarlane 's 1864 specimenwhich was validly described according to ICZN ruleswere traced and confirmed to be such a hybrid by ancient DNA techniques , the scientific name Ursus × inopinatus would be available for these animals .
CHARACTERISTICS Section::::Characteristics .
Two grizzly – polar hybrid cubs ( one female and one male ) were born at Osnabrück Zoo in Osnabrück , Germany , in 2004 , and their physical traits are generally an intermediate between the polar bear and the grizzly bear .
For example , their bodies are smaller than polar bears , but larger than grizzlies , while their heads fall between the broader grizzly head and the leaner polar bear head .
They have long necks like polar bears , but small shoulder humps like grizzlies .
The soles of their feet are partially covered in hair ; polar bears have hair - covered soles , which act as insulation , and grizzlies have hairless soles .
Similarly , the hair of the hybrids exhibits a pattern of hollowness , which blends the traits of both polar bears and grizzlies .
In cross section , the hair of polar bears is hollow , while the hair of grizzlies is either solid or has small hollow regions .
This varies according to which part of the grizzly the hair is located .
In the hybrid male , the paw hair was solid , but the dark back hair was somewhat hollow , albeit with " smaller empty regions than found in polar bear hair " .
The hair of the female hybrid , " contains a range of hollow regions " .
The hybrids demonstrated behavior more similar to polar bears than grizzlies .
They stomped toys similar to how polar bears break ice , and hurled bags to the side " as polar bears may hurl prey " .
Grizzlies given the same bags
do not demonstrate this hurling behavior .
The hybrids were also observed lying down similar to polar bears : on their bellies with rear legs splayed .
