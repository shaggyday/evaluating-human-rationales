PLOT Section::::Plot .
Evil sorceress
Queen Ravenna 's powers allow her to know that her younger sister Freya , whose powers have not yet emerged , is not only involved in an illicit affair with an already elsewhere engaged nobleman Andrew , but is also pregnant with his child .
Sometime after Freya gives birth to a baby girl , Freya discovers that Andrew not only reneged on his promise of elopement with her but also murdered their child .
In a grief - fueled rage , her broken heart freezes over and she kills him with her sudden emergence of powers - the elemental control of ice .
Freya abandons her sister 's kingdom and builds herself a new kingdom up North .
Ruling as the much feared Ice Queen , Freya orders children to be abducted so they can be trained to avoid the pain of love ( as she suffered ) , and to be an army of fearsome huntsmen to conquer for her .
Despite the training , two of her best huntsmen , Eric and Sara , grow up and fall in love , secretly bind , and plan to escape to a free life together .
Freya discovers their secret and confronts them , creates a massive ice wall to separate them , then casts Eric out of her kingdom after first forcing him to watch as Sara is killed by one of their fellow huntsmen .
Seven years later , and after Ravenna 's death , Queen Snow White falls ill after hearing Ravenna 's Magic Mirror beckoning her .
Because of its overwhelming dark magic , she ordered it to be taken to Sanctuary , the magical place that sheltered Snow White during the events leading to her retaliation and ultimately Ravenna 's death , so the mirror 's magic can forever be contained .
Snow White 's husband , William , informs Eric that the soldiers tasked with carrying the Mirror went missing while en route to the Sanctuary .
Eric realizes that he is being spied upon by Freya through sorcery ( via a magical ice owl ) .
Knowing the dark magic of the mirror can make Freya even stronger , perhaps invincible even , Eric agrees to investigate and attempt to retrieve the mirror .
Reluctantly though , he allows Snow White 's dwarf ally Nion and his annoying half - brother Gryff to come along .
While travelling to the last known location of the soldiers , they discover they seemingly attacked each other .
At a tavern later , the trio are attacked by a group of Freya 's huntsmen , but are rescued by a very much still alive Sara .
Sara reveals that she was imprisoned by Freya the entire time , only to escape recently .
They decipher that Eric was falsely made to see Sara 's death , while she was made to see him abandoning her rather than fighting to help .
Eric convinces her that Freya conjured these visions to trick them apart , and eventually has Sara join with him and the dwarves to thwart Freya .
Soon , in a surprise attack , the quartet is ensnared in a trap set by she - dwarves Bromwyn and Doreena .
They convince the she - dwarves to also help them find the Mirror , and the two lead them to the goblins that stole the mirror from Snow White 's soldiers .
The party fight off the goblins and retrieve the Mirror .
As the group nears the Sanctuary with the Mirror , they are ambushed by Freya and her huntsmen .
Freya reveals Sara has been loyal to her all along , and that Sara was using her companions to find the Mirror for her .
In the ensuing chaos , Nion and Doreena are turned into ice statues , and Sara shoots an arrow into Eric 's chest on Freya 's order , killing him .
Freya departs with the Magic Mirror , but she is unaware that Sara intentionally missed so that Eric could live .
Back in her palace , Freya recites the iconic verse associated with the Mirror , resurrecting Ravenna , who became one with the Mirror when Snow White vanquished her into it .
Boasting a new suite of powers thanks to the Mirror 's powerful magic , Ravenna usurps Freya 's rule by coordinating Freya 's huntsmen and army to reclaim the kingdoms Snow White had liberated .
Eric infiltrates the ice palace with help of Gryff and Bromwyn .
He attempts to assassinate Freya , but is stopped by Ravenna .
When Freya realizes that Sara did n't actually kill Eric , betrayed , she reluctantly sentences them both to death because of Ravenna 's manipulation .
However , Eric is able to convince a few huntsmen to rebel , claiming the love of life - long brethren .
Ravenna begins to kill the huntsmen .
Freya , realizing that she regards the huntsmen as her own surrogate " children " , protects them with an ice wall , separating the huntsmen from the sisters .
As Eric , Sara and the other huntsmen climb over the wall to fight Ravenna and retrieve the mirror , the two sisters argue over the icy kingdom .
Ravenna lets slip that she 's responsible for withdrawing her sister 's weakness , awakening her powers .
Freya , now suspicious , forces Ravenna ( who as the mirror 's captive spirit must answer her summoner 's questions truthfully ) to reveal that the mirror had told her that Freya 's child would eventually be more beautiful than Ravenna , that she enchanted Andrew to kill the baby , ultimately causing the death of Freya 's child so she could remain ' the fairest of them all ' .
Freya , outraged by her sister 's evil deception and betrayal , finally turns against her .
Freya is impaled by Ravenna , but with her remaining strength Freya freezes the Magic Mirror .
Eric takes advantage and shatters the Mirror , thus destroying Ravenna .
As Freya dies from her wounds , she smiles at the sight of a vision of her old loving self , and gladly witnesses
Eric and Sara 's devotion for each other .
With Freya 's death , those who had been imprisoned by Freya 's magic are set free , including Nion and Doreena , while a mysterious golden bird flies overhead .
Eric , Sara and the huntsmen look forward to a new future while the dwarves pair off romantically and Eric and Sara share a kiss , finally happy to have a free life together for the first time in their lives .
In a post - credits scene , Snow White with a crown on her head is seen from behind .
The aforementioned bird flies and lands on the balcony next to her .
Snow White 's own magical spy / scryer .
