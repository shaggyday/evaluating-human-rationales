PREMISE Section::::Premise .
The episodes revolve around the difficulties Miranda ( Miranda Hart ) gets herself into .
She is tall and , sometimes mistaken for a man , is addressed as ' Sir ' .
She has never fit in with her old boarding school friends , Tilly ( Sally Phillips ) and Fanny ( Katy Wix ) , and finds social situations awkward , especially around men .
She is a constant disappointment to her mother , Penny ( Patricia Hodge ) , who is desperate for her to get a proper job and a husband .
Although Miranda owns and lives above her own joke shop and boutique , she lacks any real capacity for business , so it is managed by her childhood friend Stevie Sutton ( Sarah Hadland ) .
The restaurant next door is initially run by Clive Evans ( James Holmes ) , until series three , when the restaurant 's chef , Gary Preston ( Tom Ellis ) , purchases it from him .
After many failed attempts at dating , Miranda and Gary , a friend from university whom Miranda fancies , decide to be just friends .
Nevertheless , when Gary gets a girlfriend called Rose ( Naomi Bentley ) , it prompts Miranda to start a new relationship with Michael Jackford ( Bo Poraj ) , a local reporter whose work soon takes him to Africa .
Upon his return he proposes to Miranda , as does Gary when he realises his love for her .
Miranda accepts Gary 's proposal rather than Michael 's and Miranda and Gary get married in the final episode .
CAST
Main
castRecurring cast * Miranda Hart as Miranda –
An ungainly , socially awkward , 35-year - old woman who frequently finds herself in bizarre situations .
She is something of a misfit relative to her upper - middle - class , privately educated background , opting to invest an inheritance from her uncle in a joke / gift shop rather than pursuing what her mother perceives as a more " respectable " career , and balking at the supposedly " suitable " men that her mother and friends try to set her up with .
Miranda struggles with everyday adult life , often indulging in odd , childlike behaviour ( including adding faces and clothes to pieces of fruit and vegetables , dubbing them " Fruit Friends " and " Vegeta - Pals " ) and getting thrown out of numerous establishments .
Although this often irritates her friends and family , they tolerate her because , at heart , she is intelligent and good - natured , despite not always showing it .
In the final episode , after she breaks up with Gary , some of her awkward and childish behaviour disappears ; this causes considerable concern for her friends and mother , who organise a therapy session .
However , she finally accepts that her only serious problem – her lack of confidence – is now gone and although she does not need Gary , she does indeed love him .
After an initial panic over an unexpected wedding , she marries Gary at his restaurant .
* Tom Ellis as Gary Preston – A handsome , friendly chef ; an old university friend of Miranda 's .
Although there has always been an undercurrent of attraction between them , neither has pursued it until he begins working at the restaurant next to Miranda 's shop .
Despite often being confused by Miranda 's behaviour , Gary generally finds her kind , open nature endearing , especially as she is willing to help him out when needed .
Gary is more confident and worldly than Miranda , but he shares her insecurity in romantic situations , and occasionally becomes embroiled in odd situations with her for example , the pretence that they have sons called " Cliff " and " Richard " when challenged by a customer in the shop .
He is one of the few people who accepts Miranda as she is .
Miranda and Gary date briefly in series two , though this breaks down when it is revealed Gary was married ( for a green card ) to a waitress that Miranda had befriended at the restaurant .
Gary also dates Rose briefly in series three , before breaking up with her due to her being unable to accept Miranda .
After becoming engaged , Miranda becomes concerned that he has never said he loves her .
When she confronts him , Gary tells Miranda that her distinctive lack of confidence in herself means that they can never truly be together .
In the final episode , when Miranda accepts herself , she rushes to what she believes is Gary 's wedding , where he is actually best man for his former boss Clive .
Gary reveals he has already decided that he loves Miranda and offers to elope ; she decides that she does not need to run away and marries Gary at Clive 's reception .
* Sarah Hadland as Stevie Sutton – Miranda 's childhood friend , and the assistant manager of the joke shop ( although in reality she does most of the work due to Miranda 's lack of business sense ) .
She is generally more level - headed and ambitious than Miranda , but is not averse to becoming involved in her strange behaviour , or indeed indulging in some of her own , including frequently performing Heather Small 's " Proud " while holding a cardboard cut - out of the singer whenever she is pleased with herself .
Because of this , Miranda and Stevie often get into petty arguments and competitions , such as when a customer leaves his wallet and both Miranda and Stevie attempt to impress him .
Miranda frequently mocks Stevie for her small stature , and frequently pushes her over when she irritates Miranda .
Despite often claiming to have " the allure " and mocking Miranda 's attempts with men , Stevie also shares Miranda 's lack of success , sometimes coming across as desperate when she chats someone up .
She occasionally uses an unkempt and unpleasant traffic warden ( played by Joe Wilkinson ) as a date when trying to compete with Miranda .
In the final episode , the traffic warden appears again and Stevie kisses him to avoid getting a parking ticket .
* Patricia Hodge as Penny – Miranda 's middle - class mother , a " lady who lunches " , who likes to impress her friends and fellow W.I. members .
Her main mission in life is to find Miranda a man and a better job .
She despairs at Miranda 's decision to run a joke / gift shop , and her tendency to reject suitable ( or at least available ) men , on numerous occasions trying to set up Miranda with her cousin .
Although often embarrassed by her daughter , Penny displays many of Miranda 's erratic traits and often teams up with Miranda for their benefit , such as when they are in the psychiatrist 's office .
Despite being prepared to humiliate Miranda for her own gain ( to the point of holding up a placard offering to pay someone to marry Miranda ) , Penny 's actions are borne out of genuine love and concern , and on the rare occasions where Miranda is doing well she shows her love by cheering " Go Miranda " .
Penny 's catchphrase , " Such fun ! " is normally used to describe an activity or event where she believes Miranda may find a husband .
Another catchphrase of Penny 's , especially in the first series , is ' What I call ' , which she says before numerous everyday things before Miranda points out that that is simply the word for it , and not just what Penny calls it ( for example , ' I 'm meeting a friend for a spot of , what I call , tea . ' )
Penny tends to ignore Miranda 's obvious disinterest or discomfort .
In the final episode , Penny turns up at Miranda 's flat two days after her break - up with Gary , insensitively suggesting they simply find another groom .
Miranda finally loses her temper and tells Penny to get out ; this causes Penny to go on a drinking binge at her local tennis club .
She soon turns up at Miranda 's flat and tearfully confesses that her relationship with Miranda 's father has been dead for some time .
Thanks to her daughter 's new confidence , Penny regains her dignity and joyfully embraces Miranda when she marries Gary several days later .
* Sally Phillips as Tilly – An old school friend of Miranda 's and the daughter of Penny 's never - seen friend Belinda , who fits right in with their private school background , often showing more in common with Penny than Miranda does .
Tilly is a socialite and normally quite self - centred , though on occasion , she does come through for her friends and shows that she is kind and generous .
She will often address Miranda by her school nickname , " Queen Kong " ( due to Miranda 's stature and clumsiness ) , despite Miranda 's displeasure , but her criticisms and attempts to help Miranda are generally well intentioned .
Tilly 's catchphrase is " bear with " , usually said as she breaks off conversations to read text messages .
While seeming more confident and together than Miranda , she has her own problems romantically , particularly when her fiancé , Rupert ( played by Adam James ) , makes a pass at Miranda behind her back .
In the penultimate episode , she becomes engaged to her army doctor boyfriend , " Dreamboat " Charlie ( played by Adrian Scarborough ) .
The final episode sees Miranda give Tilly tickets to Wick so she can be free of her mother and elope with Charlie .
* James Holmes as Clive Evans ( 2009–2010 , 2015 ) –
The camp , vicious - tongued owner of the restaurant where Gary works .
He is usually more of a hindrance than help whenever he attempts to help Miranda and Gary get together , accidentally revealing , for example , that Gary has a secret wife from Hong Kong named Tamara ( played by Stacy Liu ) .
Despite his jibes at Miranda , he does show traits of wanting to help her , such as when he pushes her to tell Gary his true feelings .
He is absent from the third series having sold the restaurant to Gary off - screen .
Clive returns in the final episode and marries the regular customer from previous episodes ( played by Dominic Coleman ) .
* Bo Poraj as Michael Jackford ( 2012–2014 ) – Miranda 's new boyfriend who works as a television reporter and loves Miranda for the real her .
Michael made his final appearance in the penultimate episode , when Miranda peacefully turned down his marriage proposal in order to accept Gary 's .
In the final episode , Penny mentions that the character has flown to Africa , where he had previously returned from on a business venture .
* Naomi Bentley as Rose ( 2013 ) –
Gary 's new girlfriend .
When Rose ca n't accept his past affections for Miranda , Gary breaks up with her .
She is last seen entering Gary 's restaurant for its re - opening , but when Miranda confesses her true feelings for Gary during an argument , Rose immediately walks out .
* Katy Wix as Fanny ( 2009 ) –
Another socialite friend of Miranda 's from boarding school .
She appears during the first series alongside Tilly , but is not mentioned or seen as of the second series .
* John Finnemore and Margaret Cabourn - Smith as Chris and Alison ( 2009–2010 , 2013–2014 ) – Sort - of friends of Gary and Miranda .
As university students , Chris and Alison agreed to marry each other if they were still single at a certain age , but Chris whisked Alison away to Paris and proposed .
During the second series , Alison becomes pregnant and they decide that Gary and Miranda should be godparents , but Miranda freaks out when they reveal she will also act as Alison 's birthing partner .
In the third series , Miranda , Gary and Rose babysit for them .
They make their final appearance in the penultimate episode ; their once joyous marriage now strained .
* Dominic Coleman ( 2009 , 2013 , 2015 ) as ' Customer ' –
A gay man who comes into the store on three occasions , usually with the intention of buying something for his niece , but is distracted by the probing questions of Stevie and Miranda and gets roped into their antics ( For example , suggesting Miranda should lie about being gay and then being roped into attending her coming out party . )
He features in the final episode as the partner of Clive , whose wedding Miranda gatecrashes .
Although never mentioned on screen , he is referred to on the BBC 's website as ' Jim ' .
PRODUCTION CONCEPTION Section::::Production .
Section::::Conception .
Abigail Wilson , who worked for comedians Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders , suggested Hart pitch a show to the BBC after seeing her perform in 2003 .
Following a read - through of her script with Saunders and BBC executives , a television pilot , based on her semi - autobiographical writing , was filmed in early 2008 , and the series was then developed into a sitcom for radio ; Miranda Hart 's Joke Shop aired on BBC Radio 2 in August and September 2008 .
A television series was commissioned in August 2008 and began filming in June 2009 .
Outdoor shots for series one were filmed in Hounslow , West London .
In an interview with the BBC 's Writersroom , Hart said of the semi - autobiographical basis for the series :
Well I developed this stand - up persona , and that 's where it all started from .
I realised I was getting laughs being a version of me , and that 's what ended up in the sitcom .
You do ultimately start from yourself
but I 'm pleased to say I did have to exaggerate for comedic effect .
It was n't entirely autobiographical .
I 'm not quite that mad .
SERIES 1 ( 2009 )
Section::::Series 1 ( 2009 ) .
Each episode begins with a welcome to audience and a ' Previously in my life ... ' segment , and Hart says a joke shop is the " right place " as the setting after being asked to consider an office to " normalise " the character .
Her love of 1970s comedy programmes , such as Some Mothers Do ' Ave ' Em , is the influence for Miranda .
The episodes end with a ' You have been watching ... '
credits section where each cast member waves goodbye , as seen concluding Jimmy Perry and David Croft sitcoms such as Dad 's Army and Hi - de - Hi ! .
Quoted in The Times , Hart says " I 'm saying this is what I 'm doing
and I 'm not scared to do it .
Some of my comedy peers do slightly fear being a mainstream figure , as if it 's slightly uncool .
Well , I thought I 'm going to embrace it . "
Throughout each episode , Hart breaks the fourth wall and addresses the audience directly , a technique described as a " simple creative decision [ that ] makes this infectious comedy sing " ; another critic stated " this is hard to pull off , but it works well " .

( 2010 )
Section::::Series 2 ( 2010 ) .
Following the conclusion of the first series , the BBC commissioned a second series for BBC Two in 2010 .

RECEPTION Section::::Reception .
The first series was picked as one of the top 10 forthcoming TV shows for Autumn 2009 by The Sunday Times .
Ahead of the first episode airing , Dominic Maxwell in an article for The Times described it as an " old - school " sitcom and said that " It 's good fun , if you buy into it .
And if you do , it 's because of Hart . "
Also describing it as " old - fashioned " , Vicky Frost for The Guardian said of the slapstick physical comedy that " It 's not clever – but it is funny .
And that , I think is at the heart of Miranda 's appeal . "
Mark Wright for The Stage said that Hodge gives a " brilliant , brilliant performance " and that " what sets Miranda out as something special is Hart herself , and the rest just gels around her .
" The first series opened with 2.63 million viewers ( 10 % audience share ) , rising to 3.14 million viewers ( 12 % share ) for the fourth episode .
The second series opened with 3.19 million viewers , rising to 4.01 million viewers for the third episode .
Rachel Tarley from the Metro said Miranda is an acquired taste and that an episode can be a mixed bag .
However , Tarley enjoyed the festive episode of series 2 , saying " Hart got away with a lot of the more irritating qualities of her work , with help from the fantastic Patricia Hodge and Sally Phillips .
Tonight was also the first we saw of Miranda 's father , played by Tom Conti , who filled most of the episode 's falling - over quota , so that Miranda finally remained pretty vertical throughout the episode . "
She added that Hart is " a great observer of everyday dilemmas " and the best thing of all
is she left the door open for a third series .
Dominic Cavendish of The Daily Telegraph called Miranda " the sitcom of the year " , while Chris Harvey of the same newspaper said " The truth is , pretty much every time Miranda turns and looks at the camera , I burst out laughing .
And even when her slapstick is so obvious it would n't confuse a small child [ .. ] I still laugh .
Even when I 'm trying not to .
Even when I really , really do n't want to . "
Meanwhile , Catherine Gee said the show was a flop and listed six reasons why , which included unoriginal jokes , Hart 's asides to the camera and the show retaining " the worst aspects of the sitcoms of yesteryear . "
The opening episode of the third series became one of the most watched shows in the UK over the Christmas period , attracting a total audience of over 11.5 million viewers .
For The Telegraph , Michael Deacon compares the programme to a childish Christmas panto , finally adding , " Perhaps I 'm just getting old .
I 'm sure I 'd have loved this show when I was six . "
Keith Watson , writing for Metro , says the series three finale is a " great end to an up - to - scratch season , Miranda never fails to cheer up an evening , reminding many of us that we are n't alone in the everyday awkward situations that we might find ourselves in – to some extent , anyway . "
George Entwistle stated , " Miranda 's been a tremendous hit with audiences on BBC Two
and I 'm very glad she 's let us persuade her to move to BBC One , where we believe we can build an even bigger following for her multi - award - winning show .
BBC Two has done an exceptional job of supporting and nurturing Miranda over a number of years and
I 'm certain she 'll be equally well looked after at BBC One . "
