GARDEN OF THE GODS Garden of the Gods is a public park located in Colorado Springs , Colorado , US .
It was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1971 .
NAME Section::::Name .
The area now known as Garden of the Gods was first called Red Rock Corral by the Europeans .
Then , in August 1859 , two surveyors who helped to set up Colorado City explored the site .
One of the surveyors , M. S. Beach , suggested that it would be a " capital place for a beer garden " .
His companion , the young Rufus Cable , awestruck by the impressive rock formations , exclaimed , " Beer Garden !
Why it is a fit place for the Gods to assemble .
We will call it the Garden of the Gods . "
The name " Garden of the Gods " was also later given to a section of the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth , Calif. , filled with large sandstone rock formations , because of the area 's resemblance to Colorado 's Garden of the Gods .
The story goes that back in the early days of Hollywood , a movie producer seeking a rocky filming location made a comment to the effect of , " Who needs to go all the way to Colorado -- we have our own ' Garden of the Gods ' here ! "
The Iverson family took the comment to heart and began calling their own collection of rock formations the " Garden of the Gods , " and the name stuck .
Today the main section of Chatsworth 's Garden of the Gods has also been preserved as a park .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The Garden of the Gods ' red rock formations were created during a geological upheaval along a natural fault line millions of years ago .
Archaeological evidence shows that prehistoric people visited Garden of the Gods about 1330 BC .
At about 250 BC , Native American people camped in the park ; they are believed to have been attracted to wildlife and plant life in the area and used overhangs created by the rocks for shelter .
Many native peoples have reported a connection to Garden of the Gods , including Apache , Cheyenne , Comanche , Kiowa , Lakota , Pawnee , Shoshone , and Ute people .
Multiple American Indian Nations traveled through Garden of the Gods .
The Utes ' oral traditions tell of their creation at the Garden of the Gods , and petroglyphs have been found in the park that are typical of early Utes .
The Utes found red rocks to have a spiritual connection and camped near Manitou Springs and the creek near Rock Ledge Ranch bordering Garden of the Gods .
The Old Ute Trail went past Garden of the Gods to Ute Pass and led later explorers through Manitou Springs .
Starting in the 16th century , Spanish explorers and later European American explorers and trappers traveled through the area , including Lt . John C. Frémont and Lt . George Frederick Ruxton , who recorded their visits in their journals .
In 1879 Charles Elliott Perkins , a friend of William Jackson Palmer , purchased 480 acres of land that included a portion of the present Garden of the Gods .
Upon Perkins ' death , his family gave the land to the City of Colorado Springs in 1909 , with the provision that it would be a free public park .
Palmer had owned the Rock Ledge Ranch and upon his death it was donated to the city .
Helen Hunt Jackson wrote of the park , " You wind among rocks of every conceivable and inconceivable shape and size ...
all bright red , all motionless and silent , with a strange look of having been just stopped and held back in the very climax of some supernatural catastrophe . "
Having purchased additional surrounding land , the City of Colorado Springs ' park grew to 1,364 acres .
In 1995 the Garden of the Gods Visitor and Nature Center was opened just outside the park .
GEOLOGICAL FORMATIONS
Section::::Geological formations .
The outstanding geologic features of the park are the ancient sedimentary beds of deep - red , pink and white sandstones , conglomerates and limestone that were deposited horizontally , but have now been tilted vertically and faulted into " fins " by the immense mountain building forces caused by the uplift of the Rocky Mountains and the Pikes Peak massif .
The following Pleistocene Ice Age resulted in erosion and glaciation of the rock , creating the present rock formations .
Evidence of past ages can be read in the rocks :
ancient seas , eroded remains of ancestral mountain ranges , alluvial fans , sandy beaches and great sand dune fields .
The resulting rocks had different shapes : toppled , overturned , stood - up , pushed around and slanted .
Balanced Rock , a fountain formation , is a combination of coarse sand , gravel , silica and hematite .
It is hematite that gives the large Balanced Rock its red hue .
Balanced Rock was formed as erosive processes removed softer layers near its base , eventually leaving the precarious - looking formation seen today .
The Gateway Rocks Three Graces , and other outcroppings are sedimentary layers that had been pushed up vertically .
The largest outcroppings in the park , " North Gateway " , " South Gateway " , " Gray Rock " , and " Sleeping Giant " are composed primarily of Lyons Formation , a stone made of fine sand from ancient sand dunes .
ECOLOGY
Section::::Ecology .
The Garden of the Gods Park is a rich ecological resource .
Retired biology professor Richard Beidleman notes that the park is " the most striking contrast between plains and mountains in North America " with respect to biology , geology , climate , and scenery .
The skull of a dinosaur was found in the park in 1878 , and was identified as a unique species , Theiophytalia kerri in 2006 .
A subspecies of honey ant not previously recorded was also discovered in 1879 and named after the park .
Mule deer , bighorn sheep and fox are common .
The park is also home to more than 130 species of birds including white - throated swifts , swallows and canyon wrens .
RECREATION Section::::Recreation .
The Garden of the Gods Park is popular for hiking , technical rock climbing , road and mountain biking and horseback riding .
It attracts more than two million visitors a year , making it the city 's most visited park .
There are more than 15 miles of trails with a 1.5-mile trail running through the heart of the park that is paved and wheelchair accessible .
Annual events including two summer running races , recreational bike rides and Pro Cycling Challenge Prologue also take place in this park .
The main trail in the park , Perkins Central Garden Trail , is a paved , wheelchair - accessible 1.1-mile trail , " through the heart of the park 's largest and most scenic red rocks " .
The trail begins at the North Parking lot , the main parking lot off of Juniper Way Loop .
Because of the unusual and steep rock formations in the park , it is an attractive destination for rock climbers .
Rock climbing is permitted , with annual permits obtained at the City of Colorado Springs ' website .
Climbers are required to follow the " Technical Climbing Regulations and Guidelines " , which includes using proper equipment , climbing in parties of two or more , and a ban on staining chalks .
Precipitation makes rocks unstable and therefore climbing is not allowed when the rocks are wet or icy .
There are fines for unregistered climbers and possibly rescue costs .
Several fatalities have occurred over the years , often when unlawful climbers fail to use proper safety equipment , or , more rarely , when a lawful climber falls due to equipment failure or user error .
