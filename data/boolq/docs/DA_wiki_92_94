ITALIAN SAUSAGE
In North America , Italian sausage ( salsiccia in Italian ) most often refers to a style of pork sausage .
The sausage is often noted for being seasoned with fennel as the primary seasoning .
In Italy , however , a wide variety of sausages are made , many of which are quite different from the product commonly known as ' Italian sausage ' in North America .
The most common varieties marketed as " Italian Sausage " in North American supermarkets are hot , sweet , and mild .
The main difference between hot and mild is the addition of hot red pepper flakes in the spice mix of the former .
The difference between mild and sweet is the addition of sweet basil in the latter .
In Australia , a variety of mild salsiccia fresca ( literally meaning " fresh sausage " ) seasoned primarily with fennel is sold as " Italian sausage " .
