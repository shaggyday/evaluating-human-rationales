MOUNTAIN DEW Mountain Dew ( stylized as Mtn Dew ) is a carbonated soft drink brand produced and owned by PepsiCo .
The original formula was invented in 1940 by Tennessee beverage bottlers Barney and Ally Hartman .
A revised formula was created by Bill Bridgforth in 1958 .
The rights to this formula were obtained by the Tip Corporation of Marion , Virginia .
William H. " Bill " Jones of the Tip corporation further refined the formula , launching that version of Mountain Dew in 1961 .
In August 1964 , the Mountain Dew brand and production rights were acquired from Tip by the Pepsi - Cola company , and the distribution expanded across the United States and Canada .
Between the 1940s and 1980s there was one variety of Mountain Dew , which was citrus - flavored and caffeinated in most markets .
Diet Mountain Dew was introduced in 1988 , followed by Mountain Dew Red , which was introduced and discontinued in 1988 .
In 2001 , a cherry flavor called Code Red debuted .
This product line extension trend has continued , with expansion into specialty , limited time production , region - specific , and retailer - specific
( Taco Bell , 7-Eleven ) variations of Mountain Dew .
Production was extended to the UK in 1996 , but was phased out in 1998 .
A similarly named but different - tasting product has been sold in the UK under the name " Mountain Dew Energy " since 2010 and in Ireland since the spring of 2011 .
The product was renamed in 2014 to simply ' Mountain Dew ' .
As of 2009 , Mountain Dew represented a 6.7 % share of the carbonated soft drinks market in the US .
Its competition includes The Coca - Cola Company 's Mello Yello and Surge , and Dr Pepper Snapple Group 's Sun Drop ; Mountain Dew accounts for 80 % of citrus soft drinks sold within the US .
ORIGIN Section::::Origin .
Tennessee bottlers Barney and Ally Hartman developed Mountain Dew as a mixer in the 1940s .
Soft drinks were sold regionally in the 1930s , and the Hartmans had difficulty in Knoxville obtaining their preferred soda to mix with liquor , preferably whiskey , so the two developed their own .
Originally a 19th century generic term for whiskey , especially Highland Scotch whiskey , the Mountain Dew name was trademarked for the soft drink in 1948 .
Charles Gordon , who had partnered with William Swartz to bottle and promote Dr. Enuf , was introduced to Mountain Dew when he met the Hartman brothers on a train and they offered him a sample .
Gordon and the Hartman brothers subsequently made a deal to bottle Mountain Dew by the Tri - Cities Beverage Corporation in Johnson City , Tennessee .
The Hartman brothers also asked Coca - Cola for input on their soda .
The Coca - Cola Company refused their offer .
The Tip Corporation of Marion , Virginia bought the rights to Mountain Dew , revising the flavor and launching it in 1961 .
In 1964 , Pepsico purchased the Tip Corporation and thus acquired the rights to Mountain Dew .
In 1999 , the Virginia legislature recognized Bill Jones and the Town of Marion for their role in the history of Mountain Dew .
PACKAGING
Section::::Packaging .
" Mountain Dew " was originally Southern and/or Scots / Irish slang for moonshine ( i.e. , homemade whiskey ) .
Using it as the name for the soda was originally suggested by Carl E. Retzke at an Owens - Illinois Inc. meeting in Toledo , Ohio , and was first trademarked by Ally and Barney Hartman in the 1940s .
Early bottles and signage carried the reference forward by showing a cartoon - stylized hillbilly .
The first sketches of the original Mountain Dew bottle labels were devised in 1948 by John Brichetto , and the representation on product packaging has changed at multiple points in the history of the beverage .
LOGO Section::::Logo .
PepsiCo ( then The Pepsi - Cola Company ) acquired the Mountain Dew brand in 1964 , and shortly thereafter in 1969 the logo was modified as the company sought to shift its focus to a " younger , outdoorsy " generation .
This direction continued as the logo remained the same through the 1970s , 1980s , and then was retired in 1996 when another logo took its place for the next three years .
Later updates to the logo were made in 1998 and then again in 2005 .
In October 2008 , the Mountain Dew logo was redesigned to " Mtn Dew " within the U.S. market , as a result of PepsiCo announcing that it would rebrand its core carbonated soft - drink products by early 2009 .
However , the variant flavors continued to use the previous design until May 2011 , when it was announced that the " Code Red " , " LiveWire " , " Voltage " , and " Baja Blast " flavor variants would be given redesigned packaging , including new logos to correspond with the " Mtn Dew " style .
The returning flavors " Pitch Black " , " Supernova " , " Typhoon " , and " Game Fuel " were given redesigned packaging and logos for their 2011 re - release .
SIDEKICK BOTTLES Section::::Sidekick bottles .
In summer 2010 , a secondary type of Mountain Dew bottles began appearing on some US shelves .
Designed by 4sight , a design and innovation firm , these bottles featured a sleeker design , smaller packaging labels , and a built - in grip .
The bottles were dubbed " Sidekick bottles " and were tested in North Carolina , South Carolina , and Indiana markets .
INGREDIENTS Section::::Ingredients .
In its primary market of the United States , the ingredient composition of Mountain Dew is listed as : " carbonated water , high - fructose corn syrup ( in much of the U.S. ) , concentrated orange juice , citric acid , natural flavors , sodium benzoate , caffeine , sodium citrate , erythorbic acid , gum arabic , Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid , brominated vegetable oil , and yellow 5 .
" The ingredient makeup of Mountain Dew varies based on the country of production .
For example , in Canada , the sweetener listed is " glucose - fructose " ( another name for high - fructose corn syrup ) , and until 2012 , it was caffeine - free by default .
Brominated vegetable oil , which is found in about 10 % of all citrus - flavored soda drinks in the US , is banned in foods throughout Europe and in Japan .
In response to negative publicity around high - fructose corn syrup , PepsiCo in 2009 released a limited - run production of Mountain Dew Throwback , a variation consisting of sugar in place of high - fructose corn syrup .
Mountain Dew Throwback subsequently was re - released for brief periods ( generally 8â€“12 weeks at a time ) , including a second wave from December 2009 to February 2010 and a third wave in the summer and fall of 2010 .
A fourth 8-week production run began in March 2011 , before it became a permanent addition to the Mountain Dew flavor line - up .
A can of Mountain Dew contains 54 mg of caffeine ( equivalent to ) .
TARTRAZINE Section::::Tartrazine .
An urban legend about Mountain Dew ingredients is that dye Yellow # 5 ( tartrazine ) lowers sperm count .
Tartrazine has never been scientifically linked to any of the alleged effects in the legends , nor has any other component of the drink .
While some studies have shown that among children ( with and without ADHD ) tartrazine can increase ADHD - like symptoms ( see Stevens , Kuczek , Burgess , Hurt & Arnold , 2010 ) , the general consensus is that it does not .
It can cause allergic - type sensitivity reactions ( e.g. hives and asthma ) in a small number of individuals , especially those who also have a sensitivity to aspirin .
PROMOTIONS AMP ENERGY Section::::Promotions .
Section::::Amp Energy .
Amp Energy is an energy drink distributed by PepsiCo under the Mountain Dew brand .
Launched in 2001 , Amp was originally known as " Mountain Dew AMP . "
From 2007 to 2008 , several additional flavors of Amp were introduced .
In 2012 , AMP 's labeling and ingredients changed , as did the flavor and appeal , according to fans .
The Mountain Dew branding was also removed from cans during this change .
TACO
BELL 'S MOUNTAIN DEW BAJA BLAST
Section::::Taco Bell 's Mountain Dew Baja Blast .
Leading up to 2004 , Pepsico conducted extensive research to develop a beverage with a taste and color to complement Taco Bell food products .
The resulting product was named Mountain Dew Baja Blast , a light blue - green colored , tropical - lime - flavored variety of the popular soft drink .
Taco Bell was given a ten - year exclusive rights period during which Baja Blast would not be available in any store or other food outlet , not even to Taco Bell 's fellow Yum brand restaurants .
In spring 2014 , Mountain Dew began distributing its Baja Blast flavor in standard 12 ounce cans , 20 ounce bottles and 24 ounce cans for sale at supermarkets and retail businesses in the US .
The new retail product bore the Taco Bell logo .
Taco Bell 's chief marketing officer , Chris Brandt , said the exclusive drinks have helped increase the company 's beverage sales , even as soda sales have declined in the broader market .
He noted that people are more likely to buy drinks when they 're available exclusively at the chain .
Due to the drink 's success , many other new beverages were introduced at Taco Bell including a new Taco Bell exclusive , Mountain Dew Sangrita Blast , a non - alcoholic sangrita flavored Mountain Dew .
DEWMOCRACY 1
Section::::DEWmocracy 1 .
Beginning in 2007 , Mountain Dew began a promotion entitled " DEWmocracy " , which involved the public electing new flavors , colors , names , packaging graphics and advertisements for upcoming Mountain Dew products .
The campaign has been the subject of recognition within the advertising industry , cited as one of the earliest and longest - running examples of a consumer product brand employing crowdsourcing to make decisions which are traditionally made internally by employees .
In its initial phase , Dewmocracy participation and voting was conducted via an online game .
Television advertisements at the time featured actor Forest Whitaker asking people to decide the next new flavor of Mountain Dew .
Online voters selected from three choices : Supernova ( a strawberry - melon flavor ) , Revolution ( a berry flavor ) , and Voltage ( a raspberry - citrus flavor ) .
Each included ginseng .
The event ended on August 17 , 2008 , with Voltage announced as the winning flavor .
It was officially released on December 29 , 2008 .
According to Beverage Digest , sales of Dewmocracy flavors totaled 25 million cases in 2008 .
DEWMOCRACY 2
Section::::DEWmocracy 2 .
Mountain Dew announced a continuation of the Dewmocracy campaign â€“ referred to as " Dewmocracy 2 " â€“ which launched in July 2009 .
A marked difference between Dewmocracy 2 and its predecessor was the wider range of online voting methods , expanding beyond the Dewmocracy website to include Facebook , Twitter , YouTube , and the " Dew Labs Community " â€“ a private , online forum for the " most passionate Dew fans . "
In July 2009 , Dew Labs sampling trucks distributed product samples of seven potential flavor variations .
At the same time , 50 " Dew fanatics " were chosen based on their video submissions to the video website 12seconds.tv , and were shipped boxes of the seven prototype flavors .
From the initial seven flavors , taste testers were asked to elect three final flavors for later release at retail stores .
The three new candidate flavors were Distortion ( a key lime flavor ) , Typhoon ( a tropical punch flavor ) , and White Out ( a smooth - citrus flavor ) .
The three new candidate flavors were released on 19 April 2010 and voting lasted until 14 June .
The following day , White Out was announced as the winner .
Mountain Dew White Out was released for sale on 4 October 2010 .
A limited production White Out Slurpee ( Mtn Dew White Out Freeze ) was made available at 7-Eleven beginning in January 2011 .
In July 2011 , Mountain Dew Typhoon was re - released briefly in 2-liter form .
GAME FUEL Section::::Game Fuel .
In 2007 , after using the term " Game Fuel " to market their sodas to the video - gaming subculture , Mountain Dew introduced a new flavor variant ( citrus cherry ) with the Game Fuel name .
Coinciding with the release of the Xbox 360 game Halo 3 , Mountain Dew Game Fuel sported a label that was almost entirely image - based , showing promotional artwork for the game and featuring the game series ' main character Master Chief prominently .
This variant remained on shelves for 12 weeks , and was discontinued afterwards .
Two years later , the website for the popular MMORPG World of Warcraft stated that two Mountain Dew Game Fuel flavors would be sold in June 2009 and would promote the game .
Shortly afterwards , the bottle art was released , and showed that the two flavors would promote different player races in the game .
One of the two was exactly the same citrus cherry flavor from the original Halo 3 promotion , with updated packaging .
The second flavor was a new wild fruit drink similar to the previously released Pepsi Blue .
Both drinks were given World of Warcraft - based packaging , and sported the newly updated " MTN Dew " logo .
Like their precursor , these two flavors lasted for 12 weeks and were discontinued .
On 24 August 2011 , Mountain Dew announced another return of the Game Fuel promotion on their Facebook page .
The original citrus - cherry would once again return , along with a new tropical companion flavor .
The announcement gave a planned release date of October 2011 and stated that the packaging would feature codes granting players double experience points in .
Both flavors were mailed out to Dew Labs members in early September 2011 , a month before the planned release date .
Later that same month , it was announced through the Facebook page that Game Fuel would be arriving to the public in mid - October , though it would vary by market .
These flavors began appearing from the first week of October , and were also discontinued after 12 weeks of being on shelves .
Game Fuel returned in October 2012 to promote Halo 4 , in the original citrus - cherry flavor .
In August 2013 , Mountain Dew announced that Game Fuel would be returning to stores in the fall of 2013 , with a new blueberry version titled " Electrifying Berry " .
In October 2013 , boxes of original citrus - cherry Game Fuel appeared on store shelves with packaging promoting Xbox One and the games
Dead Rising 3 and Forza Motorsport 5 and with cans featuring Dead Rising 3 graphics .
The new Electrifying Berry flavor of Game Fuel simultaneously appeared with packaging promoting Kinect Sports Rivals and the game
Ryse : Son of Rome , graphics from which appear on the cans as well .
In May 2014 , the original citrus - cherry Game Fuel began reappearing on shelves , but this time , the soda does not seem to be promoting any video game .
In October 2014 , Game Fuel returned with a new lemonade flavor for the promotion of .
Unlike past two - variant Game Fuel releases , both drinks sport the same artwork ( unlike 2009 's Horde Red and Alliance Blue or 2011 's citrus cherry and tropical ) , albeit differing colors to match their respective flavors .
After the promotion ended , Citrus Cherry reverted to promotionless packaging while lemonade flavor was permanently removed from shelves .
In October 2015 , Game Fuel returned a new companion flavor , Berry Lime , for the promotion of .
After the promotion , Citrus Cherry once again reverted to promotionless packaging , while the Berry Lime flavor remained available as a slurpee .
Images leaked in May 2016 led to speculation that Game Fuel would once again see a new release later in 2016 , with a new mango - flavored variant alongside the original citrus - cherry , promoting the game Titanfall 2 .
Mountain Dew announced the return of Game Fuel and the new flavor , Mango Heat , in September .
Then , in October , Game Fuel was released with the Titanfall 2 promotion , with a lower calorie version of the original citrus - cherry variant returning alongside the new Mango Heat .
In 2017 , Game Fuel returned with two previously discontinued flavors : Arctic Burst ( originally released as a slurpee flavor in 2006 to promote Superman Returns ) and Tropical Smash ( originally Flavor # 736 , one of the four prototype flavors for " DEWmocracy II " that lost to Mountain Dew White Out and did not make the final round ) .
As was the case with the 2013 promotion , the two flavors promoted two different Xbox games ( Arctic Burst promoted while Tropical Smash promoted Forza 7 ) .
For the first time , Citrus Cherry was not fully part of the promotion , instead promotionless Citrus Cherry was sold with the same white caps with codes under them as the other flavors in the promotion .
GREEN LABEL Section::::Green Label .

In June 2010 , a contest entitled " Green Label Art : Shop Series " was announced , involving 35 independent skateboard store owners who partnered with local artists to design and submit future can artwork designs .
Approximately one million votes were submitted by the conclusion of the contest in October of the same year , with Street Science Skate Shop â€“ a store in Tracy , California â€“ named the winner of a cash prize .

Five of the participating flavors were diet versions of previous DEWmocracy flavors : Diet Super Nova , Diet Voltage , Diet Crave ( originally Flavor # 722 ) , Diet Distortion , Diet Typhoon , and Diet White Out .
Another flavor , Diet Ultra Violet , was returning from its own limited release in 2009 .
The remaining competitor was a brand - new Diet flavor created specifically for the promotion - Flare ( berry - citrus - flavored ) .
Each of the eight flavors was available for tasting at specific tour locations , and special cans were also mailed to some Dew Labs members .
Also similar to the DEWmocracy campaign , those who taste - tested the Diet flavors were asked to go online and vote for which flavors they thought should be permanently sold in stores .
After the first round of voting was completed , two flavor finalists were chosen to receive a limited release to store shelves for a final round of voting .
Diet Voltage and Diet Super Nova were sold in stores for an eight - week period beginning in March 2011 .
After votes were cast , it was announced that Diet Super Nova had won , with 55 % of all votes , and it returned in January 2012 .

The puppy monkey baby dances with three men who are presumably watching the Super Bowl , offering them Mountain Dew Kickstart , which is similarly described as being a combination of three things ( Mountain Dew , juice , and caffeine ) .
