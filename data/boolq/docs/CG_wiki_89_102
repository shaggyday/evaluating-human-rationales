Section::::Songs .
The school 's fight song is " Forward Rebels .
" It is played by the Ole Miss " The Pride of the South " marching band at official university sporting events .
The song " Dixie " was played by the Ole Miss band for years at athletic events .
A modification of the Elvis Presley song An American Trilogy , now known as From Dixie with Love or Slow Dixie , was also played during football games , both home and away .
The song was first played during the half - time performance at the Ole Miss / LSU game of 1980 in Tiger Stadium .
Upon its completion , the band received a standing ovation from more than 70,000 people on hand that day .
It soon became a staple of the band for many years .
During Ole Miss 's winning streak of 2003 , audiences began chanting " The South will rise again " in place of " His truth is marching on " at the end of the song .
The chant remained a staple for the next several years .
In 2009 , with Ole Miss in the national spotlight for football success , political pressure mounted to do away with the chant .
The Student Body Government proposed to call for the chant to be changed to " To Hell with LSU " .
When this proposal was not enacted , the university asked the band to quit playing the song .
The band also plays a modification of " Dixie " called " Dixie Fanfare . "
The Hotty Toddy chant is shouted periodically throughout Ole Miss athletic games .
The phrase " Hotty Toddy " is also used as a greeting by Ole Miss students , past or present , and by Ole Miss fans .
It is very common to hear " Hotty Toddy " exchanged in airports across the country .
No one knows exactly where the Hotty Toddy chant came from .
The earliest reference to the Hotty Toddy chant was in a 1926 edition of the Daily Mississippian .
One myth claims that the chant is derived from students of an opposing team mocking Ole Miss students as " hoity toity . "
Although there is no known origin , Ole Miss fans still use the chant regularly .
The chant is as follows : Are You Ready ?
Hell
Yeah !
Damn
Right !
Hotty Toddy , Gosh Almighty ,
Who the Hell are We ?
Hey !
Flim Flam , Bim Bam ! Ole Miss by Damn !
