COMPETITIVE EATING
Competitive eating , or speed eating , is an activity in which participants compete against each other to consume large quantities of food , usually in a short time period .
Contests are typically eight to ten minutes long , although some competitions can last up to thirty minutes , with the person consuming the most food being declared the winner .
Competitive eating is most popular in the United States , Canada and Japan , where organized professional eating contests often offer prizes , including cash .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Traditionally , eating contests , often involving pies , were events at county fairs .
The recent surge in the popularity of competitive eating is due in large part to the development of the Nathan 's Hot Dog Eating Contest , an annual holiday tradition that has been held on July 4 virtually every year since the 1970s at Coney Island .
In 2001 , Takeru Kobayashi ate 50 hot dogs â€“ smashing the previous record ( 25.5 ) .
The event generates enormous media attention and has been aired on ESPN for the past eight years , contributing to the growth of the competitive eating phenomenon .
Takeru Kobayashi won it consistently from 2001 through 2006 .
He was dethroned in 2007 by Joey Chestnut .
In 2008 , Chestnut and Kobayashi tied at 59 hot dogs in 10 minutes ( the time span had previously been 12 minutes ) , and Chestnut won in an eat off in which he was the first of the two competitors to finish eating 5 hot dogs in overtime , earning Chestnut his second consecutive title .
Chestnut still holds the world record of 69 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes for the 2013 competition .
Kobayashi holds six Guinness Records , for eating hot dogs , meatballs , Twinkies , hamburgers , and pizza .
He competed in hot dog contests in 2011 and 2012 and claimed to have eaten 68 and 69 .
The current champion is Joey Chestnut , with a total of 74 hot dogs and buns eaten on July 4 , 2018 .

IFOCE Section::::IFOCE .
The International Federation of Competitive Eating ( IFOCE ) hosts nearly 50 " Major League Eating " events across North America every year .
OTHER CHALLENGES
Section::::Other challenges .
Other eating contests sponsored by restaurants can involve a challenge to eat large or extraordinarily spicy food items , including giant steaks , hamburgers and curries in a set amount of time .
Those who finish the item are often rewarded by not having to pay for the item , or with a T - shirt and the addition of their name and/or photo on a wall of challenge victors .
For example , Ward 's House of Prime located in Milwaukee , Wisconsin , has a prime rib meat challenge .
The current record is 360 ounces by Molly Schuyler in June 2017 .
Various challenges of this type are featured in the Travel Channel show Man v. Food .
The Great American Eat Off - a show that pits two average eaters against each other to see who can eat the fastest , while raising awareness for charity and then brings in a professional competitive eater to beat the winning time , raises the stakes for competitive eaters by incorporating various challenges and obstacles that would interfere with their speed .
Obstacles may include eating with two spoons , eating with no hands , or Interval Eating where the competitive eat is permitted to eat for a limited time and then must rest for a specific time ( i.e. , eat 20 seconds , rest 40 seconds , eat 20 seconds , rest 40 seconds etc . )
until they have completed the designated food .
Interval Eating was created by Gail Kasper .

STRUCTURE
FOOD
Section::::Contest structure .
Section::::Food .
The type of food used in contests varies greatly , with each contest typically only using one type of food ( e.g. a hot dog eating contest ) .
Foods used in professional eating contests include hamburgers , hot dogs , pies , pancakes , chicken wings , asparagus , pizza , ribs , whole turkeys , among many other types of food .
There is also a vegan hot dog eating competition held in Austin , Texas .
RULES AND OVERVIEW OF EVENTS Section::::Rules and overview of events .
Competitive eating contests often adhere to an 8 , 10 , 12 , or 15 minute time limit .
Most contests are presided over by a master of ceremonies , whose job is to announce the competitors prior to the contest and keep the audience engaged throughout the contest with enthusiastic play - by - play commentary and amusing anecdotes .
A countdown from 10 usually takes place at the end of the contest , with all eating coming to an end with the expiration of time .
Many professional contests also employ a series of judges , whose role is to enforce the contest rules and warn eaters about infractions .
Judges will also be called upon to count or weigh each competitor 's food and certify the results of the contest prior to the winner being announced .
CHIPMUNKING
Section::::Chipmunking .
Many eaters will attempt to put as much food in their mouths as possible during the final seconds of a contest , a practice known by professionals as " chipmunking .
" If chipmunking is allowed in a contest , eaters are given a reasonable amount of time ( typically less than two minutes ) to swallow the food or risk a deduction from their final totals .
DUNKING Section::::Dunking .
In many contests , except those adhering to " picnic style rules " mentioned previously , eaters are allowed to dunk foods in water or other liquids in order to soften the food and make it easier to chew and swallow .
Dunking typically takes place with foods involving a bun or other doughy parts .
Professional contests often enforce a limit on the number of times competitors are allowed to dunk food .
DEBRIS
Section::::Debris .
Competitors are required to maintain a relatively clean eating surface throughout the contest .
Excess debris after the contest results in a deduction from the eater 's final totals .
VOMITING
Section::::Vomiting .
If , at any point during or immediately after the contest , a competitor regurgitates any food , he or she will be disqualified .
Vomiting , also known as a " reversal " , or , as ESPN and the Nathan 's Hot Dog Eating Contest call it , a " reversal of fortune " , includes obvious signs of vomiting as well as any small amounts of food that may fall from the mouth deemed by judges to have come from the stomach .
Small amounts of food already in the mouth prior to swallowing are excluded from this rule .
TRAINING AND PREPARATION Section::::Training and preparation .
Many professional competitive eaters undergo rigorous personal training in order to increase their stomach capacity and eating speed with various foods .
Stomach elasticity is usually considered the key to eating success , and competitors commonly train by drinking large amounts of water over a short time to stretch out the stomach .
Others combine the consumption of water with large quantities of low calorie foods such as vegetables or salads .
Some eaters chew large amounts of gum in order to build jaw strength .
For a marquee event like the Nathan 's Hot Dog Eating Contest , some eaters , like current contest champion Joey Chestnut , will begin training several months before the event with personal time trials using the contest food .
Retired competitive eater Ed " Cookie " Jarvis trained by consuming entire heads of boiled cabbage followed by drinking up to two gallons of water every day for two weeks before a contest .
Due to the risks involved with training alone or without emergency medical supervision , the IFOCE actively discourages training of any sort .

CRITICISMS AND DANGERS CRITICISMS Section::::Criticisms and dangers .
Section::::Criticisms .
The chief criticism of competitive eating is the message the gluttonous sport sends as obesity levels rise among Americans and the example it sets for youth .
Others , like actor Ryan Reynolds in an editorial on The Huffington Post , contend that competitive eating is yet another example of Western gluttony at a time when so many others around the world are starving .
In the same article , retired competitive eater Don " Moses " Lerman foreshadows the dangers of competitive eating when he admits " I 'll stretch my stomach until it causes internal bleeding . "
DANGERS Section::::Dangers .
The argument that competitive eating can cause weight gain , which may lead to obesity and elevated cholesterol and blood pressure , is common .
The potential damage that competitive eating can cause to the human digestive system was the subject of a 2007 study by the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine .
The study observed professional eater Tim Janus , who ate 36 hot dogs in 10 minutes before doctors intervened .
It was concluded that through training , Janus ' stomach failed to have normal muscle contractions called peristalsis , a function which transfers food from the stomach down the digestive tract .
Other medical professionals contend that binge eating can cause stomach perforations in those with ulcers and gulping large quantities of water during training can lead to water intoxication , a condition which dilutes electrolytes in the blood .
Gastroparesis , also known as stomach paralysis , is also a concern among those who routinely stretch their stomachs beyond capacity .
The condition may lead to the stomach 's inability to contract and lose its ability to empty itself .
Side effects of gastroparesis include chronic indigestion , nausea and vomiting .
In October 2012 , a 32-year - old man died while competitively eating live roaches and worms in a contest to win a ball python .
An autopsy revealed he choked to death .
On July 4 , 2014 , a 47-year - old competitive eater similarly choked to death during a hot dog eating contest .
At a Sacred Heart University event on April 2 , 2017 , a 20-year - old female student died as a result of a pancake - eating contest .
