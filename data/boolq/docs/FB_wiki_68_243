SODIUM LACTATE Sodium lactate is the sodium salt of lactic acid , and has a mild saline taste .
It is produced by fermentation of a sugar source , such as corn or beets , and then , by neutralizing the resulting lactic acid to create a compound having the formula
NaCHO .
USAGE Section::::Usage .
As a food additive , sodium lactate has the E number E325 and is naturally a liquid product , but also is available in powder form .
It acts as a preservative , acidity regulator , and bulking agent .
Sodium lactate is sometimes used in shampoo products and other similar items such as liquid soaps , as it is an effective humectant and moisturizer .
Sodium lactate is used to treat arrhythmias caused by overdosing of class I antiarrythmics , as well as pressor sympathomimetics which can cause hypertension .
It also can be given intravenously as a source of bicarbonate for preventing or controlling mild to moderate metabolic acidosis in patients with restricted oral intake ( for sodium bicarbonate ) whose oxidative processes are not seriously impaired .
However , the use in lactic acidosis is contraindicated .
It can cause panic attacks in patients with existing panic disorder .
REGARDING MILK
Section::::Regarding milk .
Despite the similarity in name , sodium lactate is not chemically similar to lactose ( milk sugar ) , so need not be restricted by those with lactose intolerance .
In general , lactates such as sodium , calcium , and potassium lactate are salts derived from the neutralization of lactic acid and most commercially used lactic acids are fermented from dairy - free products such as cornstarch , potatoes , or molasses .
Sugar or tapioca additionally may be used .
In some rare instances , some lactic acid is fermented from dairy products such as whey and lactose .
Whey is made of up 6.5 % solids of which 4.8 % is solid lactose .
Waste whey is infrequently used to produce lactic acid when the whey itself is produced as waste during the manufacture of certain dairy products .
Such dairy - type lactic acid generally goes back into dairy products , such as ice cream and cream cheese , rather than into nondairy products .
Moreover , although the lactic - acid starter culture to ferment corn or beets may contain milk , sodium lactate does not contain milk protein and need not be restricted by someone avoiding milk or those with a milk allergy .
