CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IN NEW YORK
While laws regarding the imposition of capital punishment in the State of New York are still on the books , it is no longer enforced as it is been declared unconstitutional in the state and this ruling has not been overturned .
The last execution took place in 1963 , when Eddie Mays was electrocuted at Sing Sing Prison .
The state was the first to adopt the electric chair as a method of execution , which replaced hanging .
Following the U.S. Supreme Court 's ruling declaring existing capital punishment statutes unconstitutional in Furman v. Georgia ( 1972 ) , New York was without a death penalty until 1995 , when then - Governor George Pataki signed a new statute into law , which provided for execution by lethal injection .
In June 2004 , the state 's highest court ruled in People v. LaValle that the state 's death penalty statute violated the state constitution , and New York has had an effective moratorium on capital punishment since then .
Subsequent legislative attempts at fixing or replacing the statute have failed , and in 2008 then - Governor David Paterson issued an executive order disestablishing New York 's death row .
Legislative efforts to amend the statute have failed , and death sentences are no longer sought at the state level , though certain crimes that fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government are subject to the federal death penalty .
COLONIAL PERIOD AND STATEHOOD Section::::Colonial period and statehood .
During various periods from the 1600s onward , New York law prescribed the death penalty for crimes such as sodomy , adultery , counterfeiting , perjury , and attempted rape or murder by slaves .
In 1796 , New York abolished the death penalty for crimes other than murder and treason , but arson was made a capital crime in 1808 .
TEMPORARY ABOLITION
Section::::Temporary abolition .
In 1860 , the New York Legislature passed a bill which effectively , though unintentionally , abolished capital punishment in the state , by repealing hanging as a method of execution without prescribing an alternative method .
The bill was signed by Governor Edwin D. Morgan in April 1860 .
The New York Court of Appeals ruled the statute unconstitutional , in part , as an ex post facto law .
Governor Morgan signed legislation to restore the death penalty in 1861 , and again in 1862 to fully repeal the earlier statute .
INTRODUCTION OF THE ELECTRIC CHAIR Section::::Introduction of the electric chair .
In 1886 , newly elected New York State governor David B. Hill set up a three - member " New York Commission " to determine a new , more humane system of execution to replace hanging .
The commission included the human rights advocate and reformer Elbridge Thomas Gerry , New York lawyer and politician Matthew Hale , and Buffalo dentist and experimenter Alfred P. Southwick .
Southwick had been developing an idea since the early 1880s of using electric current as a means of capital punishment after hearing about how relatively painlessly and quickly a drunken man died due to grabbing the energized parts on a generator .
Southwick had published this proposal first in 1882 and , being a dentist accustomed to performing procedures on subjects in chairs , used the form of a chair in his designs , which became known as the " electric chair " .
The commission reviewed ancient and modern forms of execution including lethal injection but finally settled on electrocution in 1888 .
A bill making electrocution New York State 's form of execution passed the legislature and was signed by Governor Hill on June 4 , 1888 , set to go into effect on January 1 , 1889 .
The first individual to be executed in the electric chair was William Kemmler , on August 6 , 1890 .
Current was passed through Kemmler for 17 seconds and he was declared dead , but witnesses noticed he was still breathing , and the current was turned back on .
From start to finish , the execution took eight minutes .
During the execution , blood vessels under the skin ruptured and bled , and some witness reported that Kemmler 's body set on fire .
STATISTICS Section::::Statistics .

POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE IN MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY
ELECTIONS
Section::::Political significance in Manhattan District Attorney elections .

it was legal in New York .
In the 2009 Democratic primary in which Morgenthau did not run , Snyder ran for District Attorney again , against Cyrus Vance , Jr. ( who would win ) and Richard Aborn .
Both opponents strongly opposed the death penalty , and criticized Snyder for her previous comments .
Snyder accused Vance and Aborn of taking her comments out of context , and stated that her position on the death penalty had changed due to learning about wrongful convictions .
Aborn said he would oppose attempts to restore it , and would " lead the effort against any attempt to revive it " .
