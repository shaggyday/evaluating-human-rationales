SHORT FILM TALES OF THE CODE :
WEDLOCKED ( 2011 ) Section::::Short film .
Section::::Tales of the Code :
Wedlocked ( 2011 ) .
Wenches Scarlett ( Lauren Maher ) and Giselle ( Vanessa Branch ) fix each other up for their wedding , in which they would each marry their groom .
Upon realizing that both their grooms were the same man — Jack Sparrow — the two wenches find themselves in an auction led by the Auctioneer .
The short film serves as a prequel to The Curse of the Black Pearl , explaining just why Jack Sparrow 's boat , the Jolly Mon , was seen sinking at the beginning of the whole story , and explaining why wenches Scarlett and Giselle were so upset with him , and it also implies how Cotton lost his tongue .
The plot took inspiration from the " Auction scene " from the original ride .
The short was directed by James Ward Byrkit , and was only included as a special feature in the US 15-disc 3D Blu - ray/2D Blu - ray / DVD + Digital Copy box set that includes films 1–4 ; and in the similar UK five - disc set .
Byrkit conceived the idea for the project while on sets Rick Heinrichs designed for ( 2006 ) and ( 2007 ) .
As the pirate cove sets from the feature films — where the short film takes place — were set to be demolished , the short project was prepped in a matter of days and shot over three days .
Byrkit based the short film on the Pirate Code Book as it was a device that could tie into other stories later .
PRODUCTION
FIRST FILM
Section::::Production .
Section::::First film .
In the early 1990s screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio conceived a supernatural spin on the pirate genre after completing work on Aladdin , but there was no interest from any studio .
Undeterred , the writing team refused to give up the dream , waiting for a studio to pick up their take on a pirate tale .
Disney had Jay Wolpert write a script based on the Pirates of the Caribbean , which producer Jerry Bruckheimer rejected , feeling it was " a straight pirate movie " .
Bruckheimer brought Stuart Beattie in to rewrite the script in March 2002 , due to his knowledge of piracy , and later that month Elliott and Rossio were brought in .
Elliott and Rossio , inspired by the opening narration of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride , decided to give the film a supernatural edge .
As the budget rose , Michael Eisner and Robert Iger threatened to cancel the film , though Bruckheimer changed their minds when he showed them concept art and animatics .
In June 2002 Gore Verbinski signed on to direct , and Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush signed on the following month to star .
Verbinski was attracted to the idea of using modern technology to resurrect a genre , one that had disappeared after the Golden Age of Hollywood , and recalled his childhood memories of the ride , feeling the film was an opportunity to pay tribute to the " scary and funny " tone of it .
Depp was attracted to the story as he found it quirky : rather than trying to find treasure , the crew of the Black Pearl were trying to return it in order to lift their curse ; also , the traditional mutiny had already taken place .
Verbinski approached Rush for the role of Barbossa , as he knew he would not play it with attempts at complexity , but with a simple villainy that would suit the story 's tone .
Orlando Bloom read the script after Rush , with whom he was working on Ned Kelly , suggested it to him .
Keira Knightley came as a surprise to Verbinski : he had not seen her performance in Bend It Like Beckham and was impressed by her audition .
Tom Wilkinson was negotiated with to play Governor Swann , but the role went to Jonathan Pryce , whom Depp idolized .
Shooting for The Curse of the Black Pearl began on October 9 , 2002 and wrapped by March 7 , 2003 .
Before its release , many executives and journalists had expected the film to flop , as the pirate genre had not been successful for years , the film was based on a theme - park ride , and Depp rarely made a big film .
However , The Curse of the Black Pearl became both a critical and commercial success .
SECOND AND THIRD FILMS Section::::Second and third films .
After seeing how well the first film was made , the cast and crew signed for two sequels to be shot back - to - back , a practical decision on Disney 's part to allow more time with the same cast and crew .
Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio knew that with an ensemble cast , they were n't free to invent totally different situations and characters , as with the Indiana Jones and James Bond series , and so had to retroactively turn The Curse of the Black Pearl into the first of a trilogy .
They wanted to explore the reality of what would happen after Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann 's embrace at the end of the first film , and initially considered the Fountain of Youth as the plot device .
They settled on introducing Davy Jones , the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken , a mythology mentioned twice in the first film .
They introduced the historical East India Trading Company ( also mentioned in the first film ) , which for them represented a counterpoint to the themes of personal freedom represented by pirates .
Filming for the sequels began on February 28 , 2005 , with finishing on March 1 , 2006 , and on January 10 , 2007 .
The second film was also the first Disney theatrical feature film with the computer - generated Walt Disney Pictures logo .
FOURTH FILM Section::::Fourth film .
Rossio and Elliot discovered the novel On Stranger Tides during production of Dead Man 's Chest and At World 's End and decided to use it as the basis for a fourth film .
As Gore Verbinski was unavailable , Bruckheimer invited Rob Marshall to direct the film .
Elliott and Rossio decided to do a stand - alone film , with a story that would support new characters , and incorporate elements from the novel , such as Blackbeard , the Fountain of Youth and mermaids — the latter two having been already alluded to in the previous films .
Depp , Rush , Greg Ellis and Kevin McNally returned to their roles , and the cast saw the additions of Ian McShane as Blackbeard and Penélope Cruz as Angelica , Blackbeard 's daughter and Jack Sparrow 's love interest .
A further addition was Richard Griffiths as King George II of Great Britain .
After the costly production of two simultaneous films , Disney tried to scale down the fourth installment , giving a lower budget , which led to cheaper locations and fewer scenes with special effects .
It was also filmed in 3D , with cameras similar to the ones used in Avatar .
Filming for began June 14 , 2010 and ended on November 19 , 2010 .
It was released in the United States on May 20 , 2011 .
With a budget of $ 378.5 million , On Stranger Tides holds the record for most expensive film ever made .
FIFTH FILM Section::::Fifth film .
On January 14 , 2011 , it was confirmed that Terry Rossio would write the screenplay for the fifth installment , without his co - writer Ted Elliott .
On January 11 , 2013 , Jeff Nathanson signed on to write the script for the film .
On May 29 , 2013 , it was announced that Norwegian directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg were selected to direct .
On August 22 , 2013 , the two revealed that the title of the fifth film would be , alluding to the line well - known from the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park attractions .
Although , the film was given an alternative title , Salazar 's Revenge , in selected European , South American and Asian countries for marketing purposes .
They also confirmed that they were working on the film , speaking highly of Jeff Nathanson 's " funny and touching " script and that they are inspired by the first film , .
On September 10 , 2013 , Disney pushed back the film 's initial 2015 release , with sources indicating that a Summer 2016 release is likely .
Producer Jerry Bruckheimer revealed that script issues were behind the delay , and that Jeff Nathanson was at work on a second attempt based on a well - received outline .
While Disney originally announced a release on July 7 , 2017 , Dead Men Tell No Tales was released on May 26 , 2017 .
A spokesman for the Australian Arts Minister confirmed that the fifth installment was set to shoot in Australia after the government agreed to repurpose $ 20 million of tax incentives originally intended for the remake of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea .
Disney and Ian Walker the Queensland Arts Minister , confirmed on October 2 , 2014 , that filming was expected to start in February 2015 , stating that filming will take place exclusively in Australia , being the largest production to ever shoot in the country .
Village Roadshow Studios and Port Douglas were officially confirmed as filming locations .

CinemaScore
The series is noted for its high quality of acting talent , and is one of the aspects of the films that is always praised .
The visual and practical effects are considered some of the best ever done on film , so much so that audiences believed certain CGI elements of the films were real and done practically .
However , the plots of the four sequels have received mixed reviews , with the general consensus that they are too bloated and convoluted to follow .
Pirates of the Caribbean is noted for reinvigorating the pirate genre of film after decades of either no pirate films or failed pirate films .
The success of the series saw Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer try to replicate the franchise 's success by launching films such as and The Lone Ranger , the latter of which directed by Gore Verbinski .
Both movies failed critically and commercially .
