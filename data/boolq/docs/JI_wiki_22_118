STORY Section::::Story .
The series begins in 1935 , when Louisa Durrell suddenly announces that she and her four children will move from Bournemouth to the Greek island of Corfu .
Her husband has died some years earlier and the family is experiencing financial problems .
A Homeric battle ensues as the family adapts to life on the island which , despite a lack of electricity , proves that Corfu is cheap and an earthly paradise .
A degree of artistic licence is employed : in the TV series , the family move to Corfu together , whereas in real life Lawrence Durrell , the eldest child ( 23 years of age in 1935 ) , had already moved to the island earlier the same year with his wife .
