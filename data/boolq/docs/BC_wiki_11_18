HISTORY Section::::History .
Central University was founded in 1874 on the present site of Eastern Kentucky University .
In 1901 , beset with financial difficulties and small enrollment , Central University agreed to consolidation with Centre College .
The Kentucky General Assembly of 1906 enacted legislation establishing the Eastern Kentucky State Normal School No . 1 .
The legislation was signed into law by the governor on March 21 , 1906 .
On May 7 , 1906 , the Normal School Commission selected the site of the former Central University campus to be the location of the new school .
In 1922 it became a four - year institution and changed its name to the Eastern Kentucky State Normal School and Teachers College , awarding its first degrees under that name in 1925 .
The school received accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1928 ; then , two years later , in 1930 , it changed its name again to the Eastern Kentucky State Teachers College .
Eastern added graduate studies in 1935 , and thirteen years later , in 1948 , the General Assembly removed the word " Teachers " from the school 's name , and granted it the right to award nonprofessional degrees .
It was not until 1966 that the school was officially renamed Eastern Kentucky University .
In 2010 , the university awarded its first doctoral degree — in Educational Leadership and Policy Studies .
EKU continues to serve its service region by offering adult degree completion options and online degree programs in addition to its traditional on - campus offerings .
