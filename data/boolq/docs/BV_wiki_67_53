TOMATO PURÉE Tomato purée is a thick liquid made by cooking and straining tomatoes .
The difference between tomato paste , tomato purée , and tomato sauce is consistency ; tomato puree has a thicker consistency and a deeper flavour than sauce .
The definitions of tomato purée vary from country to country .
In the U.S. , tomato purée is a processed food product , usually consisting of only tomatoes , but can also be found in the seasoned form .
It differs from tomato sauce or tomato paste in consistency and content ; tomato purée generally lacks the additives common to a complete tomato sauce and does not have the thickness of paste .
To prepare tomato purée , ripe tomatoes are washed and the sepals and stem are removed .
Some processors remove the skin of the tomato as well .
The fruit flesh is then mashed or mechanically chopped to the desired consistency .
Tomato purée can be used in soups , stews , sauces , or any other dish where the tomato flavor is desired , but not the texture .
It is less often used by professional chefs , who find it to have an overly cooked flavor compared to other forms of canned tomatoes .
This is sometimes a non - issue , as in long - cooked dishes , but in quick sauces such as a marinara sauce it is undesirable .
Tomato purée has approx 16 % solids content .
Lower solids content is due to filtering , higher content is due to concentration of the product .
A related product , passata di pomodoro , is a tomato purée that is sieved and not cooked .
In this form , it is generally sold in bottles or aseptic packaging , and is most common in Europe .
