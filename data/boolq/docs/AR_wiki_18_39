HOVERFLY Hoverflies , sometimes called flower flies , or syrphid flies , make up the insect family Syrphidae .
As their common name suggests , they are often seen hovering or nectaring at flowers ; the adults of many species feed mainly on nectar and pollen , while the larvae ( maggots ) eat a wide range of foods .
In some species , the larvae are saprotrophs , eating decaying plant and animal matter in the soil or in ponds and streams .
In other species , the larvae are insectivores and prey on aphids , thrips , and other plant - sucking insects .
Aphids alone cause tens of millions of dollars of damage to crops worldwide every year ; because of this , aphid - eating hoverflies are being recognized as important natural enemies of pests , and potential agents for use in biological control .
Some adult syrphid flies are important pollinators .
About 6,000 species in 200 genera have been described .
Hoverflies are common throughout the world and can be found on all continents except Antarctica .
Hoverflies are harmless to most other animals , despite their mimicry of more dangerous wasps and bees , which wards off predators .
DESCRIPTION Section::::Description .
The size of hoverflies varies depending on the species .
Some , like members of the genus Baccha , are small , elongated , and slender , while others , like members of Criorhina , are large , hairy , and yellow and black .
As members of the Diptera , all hoverflies have a single functional pair of wings ( the hind wings are reduced to balancing organs ) .
They are brightly colored , with spots , stripes , and bands of yellow or brown covering their bodies .
Due to this coloring , they are often mistaken for wasps or bees ; they exhibit Batesian mimicry .
Despite this , hoverflies are harmless .
With a few exceptions ( e.g. ) , hoverflies are distinguished from other flies by a spurious vein , located parallel to the fourth longitudinal wing vein .
Adults feed mainly on nectar and pollen .
They also hover around flowers , lending to their common name .
Bee flies of the family Bombyliidae often mimic Hymenoptera and hover around flowers as well , rendering some bombyliid species hard to tell apart from Syrphidae at first glance .
Hoverflies can nevertheless be distinguished in the field by anatomical features such as : * The legs and mouthparts of hoverflies are usually not particularly long and thin ( some bombyliids have a long and needle - like proboscis , many have legs that are noticeably longer and thinner than in similar sized syrphids )
* Their facial cuticle often has prominent bulges and/or beak- to knob - like projections ( most bee flies have an evenly curved or sloping face )
* The wings are often clear or have smooth gradients of tinting , their veins merge posteriorly into a " false edge " that runs parallel to the wing 's true rear edge and extends along half or more of the wing length ( bombyliid wings lack a " false rear edge " and often have large dark areas with sharp boundaries , or complex patterns of spots )
* The abdomen and thorax often have glossy cuticular body surfaces , abdominal colors are usually mainly due to cuticular pigments ( bee flies are usually very hairy , their abdominal colors are almost always due to pigmentation of hairs and not the underlying cuticle ) .
REPRODUCTION AND LIFECYCLE Section::::Reproduction and lifecycle .
Unlike adults , the maggots of hoverflies feed on a variety of foods ; some are saprotrophs , eating decaying plant or animal matter , while others are insectivores , eating aphids , thrips , and other plant - sucking insects .
This is beneficial to gardens , as aphids destroy crops , and hoverfly maggots are often used in biological control .
Certain species , such as Lampetia equestris or Eumerus tuberculatus , are responsible for pollination .
An example of a well - known hoverfly maggot is the rat - tailed maggot , of the drone fly , Eristalis tenax .
It has a breathing siphon at its rear end , giving it its name .
The species lives in stagnant water , such as sewage and lagoons .
The maggots also have a commercial use , and are sometimes sold for ice fishing .
On occasion , hoverfly larvae have been known to cause accidental myiasis in humans .
This occurs when the larvae are accidentally ingested on food or from other sources .
Myiasis causes discomfort , pain , or itching ; however , hoverflies do not normally prey upon humans and cases of myiasis from hoverflies are very rare .
DISTRIBUTION AND HABITAT Section::::Distribution and habitat .
Hoverflies are a cosmopolitan family found in most biomes , except deserts , tundra at extremely high latitudes , and Antarctica .
Certain species are more common in certain areas than others ; for example , the American hoverfly , Eupeodes americanus , is common in the Nearctic ecozone , and the common hoverfly , Melangyna viridiceps , is common in the Australasia ecozone .
About 6,000 species and 200 genera are in the family .
While some hoverfly larvae are aquatic and are often found in stagnant water , those of species which prey upon aphids and other plant pests are usually terrestrial , residing on leaves .
Adults are often found near flowers , their principal food source being nectar and pollen .
Some species are found in more unusual locations ; for example , members of the genus Volucella can be found in bumblebee nests , while members of Microdon are myrmecophiles , found in ant or termite nests .
Others can be found in decomposing vegetation .
POLLINATION
Section::::Pollination .
Hoverflies are important pollinators of flowering plants in a variety of ecosystems worldwide .
Syrphid flies are frequent flower visitors to a wide range of wild plants , as well as agricultural crops , and are often considered the second - most important group of pollinators after wild bees .
However , relatively little research into fly pollinators has been conducted compared with bee species .
Bees are thought to be able to carry a greater volume of pollen on their bodies , but flies may be able to compensate for this by making a greater number of flower visits .
Like many pollinator groups , syrphid flies range from species that take a generalist approach to foraging by visiting a wide range of plant species to those that specialize in a narrow range of plants .
Although hoverflies are often considered mainly nonselective pollinators , some hoverflies species are highly selective and carry pollen from one plant species .
Cheilosia albitarsis is thought to only visit Ranunculus repens .
Specific flower preferences differ between species , but syrphid fly species have repeatedly been shown to prefer white- and yellow - coloured flowers .
Nonvisual flower cues such as olfactory cues also help the flies to find flowers , especially those that are not yellow .
Many syrphid fly species have short , unspecialized mouth parts and tend to feed on flowers that are more open as the nectar and pollen can be easily accessed .
Also , a number of fascinating interactions occur between orchids and hoverflies .
The orchid species Epipactis veratrifolia mimics alarm pheromones of aphids to attract hoverflies for pollination .
Another plant , the slipper orchid in southwest China , also achieves pollination by deceit by exploiting the innate yellow color preference of syrphide .
CASE STUDY –
NEW ZEALAND Section::::Case study – New Zealand .
More than 40 species of syrphid flies are found in New Zealand in a variety of habitats , including agricultural fields and alpine zones .
Two hoverfly species in Switzerland are being investigated as potential biological control agents of hawkweeds in New Zealand .
Native hoverfly species Melanostoma fasciatum and Melangyna
novaezelandiae are common on agricultural fields in New Zealand .
Coriander and tansy leaf are particularly attractive to many species of adults , which feed on their pollen .
In organic paddocks , hoverflies were found to feed on an average of three and a maximum of six different pollens .
M. fasciatum has a short proboscis , which restricts it to obtaining nectar from disk flowers .
Syrphid flies are also common visitors to flowers in alpine zones in New Zealand .
Native flies ( Allograpta and Platycheirus ) in alpine zones show preferences for flower species based on their colour in alpine zones ; syrphid flies consistently choose yellow flowers over white regardless of species .
However , syrphid flies are not as effective pollinators of alpine herb species as native solitary bees .
SYSTEMATICS RELATIONSHIP WITH HUMANS Section::::Relationship with Humans .
Many species of hoverfly larvae prey upon pest insects , including aphids and the leafhoppers , which spread some diseases such as curly top .
Therefore , they are seen in biocontrol as a natural means of reducing the levels of pests .
Gardeners , therefore , sometimes use companion plants to attract hoverflies .
Those reputed to do so include alyssum , Iberis umbellata , statice , buckwheat , chamomile , parsley , and yarrow .
Fredrik Sjöberg 's book
The Fly Trap concerns his enthusiasm for hoverflies on the island of Runmarö in the Baltic Sea .
The island is a hotspot for hoverflies and other insects ; Sjöberg has collected 58 species of butterfly there , and ( in seven years of hunting ) 202 species of hoverfly , including 180 in his garden .
He estimates that in 2014 , there were only 25 hoverfly enthusiasts in the whole of Sweden .
