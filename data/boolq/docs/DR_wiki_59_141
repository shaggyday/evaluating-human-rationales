FRICTION TAPE Friction tape is a type of adhesive tape made from cloth impregnated with a rubber - based adhesive , mainly used to insulate splices in electric wires and cables .
Because the adhesive is impregnated in the cloth , friction tape is sticky on both sides .
The rubber - based adhesive makes it an electrical insulator and provides a degree of protection from liquids and corrosion .
In the past , friction tape was widely used by electricians , but PVC electrical tape has replaced it in most applications today .
The frictional properties of the tape come from the cloth material , which is usually made from cotton , while the fabric base protects electrical splices against punctures and abrasion .
OTHER USES
Section::::Other uses .
Aside from its original purpose as an electrical insulating tape , a common use for friction tape is to wrap it around the blade of a hockey stick to improve puck control .
Another use is to wrap it around the handle of a softball or baseball bat to provide a better grip .
It is also useful as a base when wrapping a bicycle handlebar with handlebar tape .
