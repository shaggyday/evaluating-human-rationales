ARKANSAS RAZORBACKS BASEBALL
The University of Arkansas Razorbacks baseball team , sometimes referred to as the OmaHogs or Diamond Hogs , are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) and the Southeastern Conference ( SEC ) , and are currently coached by Dave Van Horn .
The program started in 1897 , and is in its 96th season of play ( 71st consecutive ) in 2018 .
Arkansas is one of only four schools in the SEC to turn a profit from its baseball program in recent years , along with SEC Western division rivals LSU , Mississippi State and
Ole Miss. Many large schools such as Iowa State , Colorado , and Wisconsin have dropped their baseball programs because of financial losses .
The Diamond Hogs have been to 30 NCAA tournaments and nine College World Series : 1979 , 1985 , 1987 , 1989 , 2004 , 2009 , 2012 , 2015 , 2018 .
VENUE Section::::Venue .
The Razorbacks play baseball home games in Baum Stadium at George Cole Field , which holds 10,737 .
Arkansas was the first program in the nation to have an average attendance over 8,000 for the course of the season .
Baum Stadium has hosted NCAA regionals in 1999 , 2004 , 2006 , 2007 , 2010 , 2017 and 2018 .
The Arkansas baseball team also hosted an NCAA Super Regional in 2004 against Florida State , in 2015 against Missouri State and again in 2018 against the University of South Carolina .
One of the games in the 2015 Super Regional series against Missouri State set the all - time stadium attendance mark at 12,167 .
The first game of the South Carolina Super Regional series had 11 , 722 in attendance making it the 3rd highest attended game in Baum stadium history .
Baum stadium was voted top ballpark in collegiate baseball by Baseball America , 20 years after claiming the top spot in a 1998 poll .
In 2007 , Arkansas led the nation in attendance , with 8,069 attendees per game , over 700 more per game than second - place LSU .
Mississippi State , another SEC school , was third with an average of 6,795 per game .
Before Baum Stadium was built , the Razorbacks played on the original George Cole Field from 1975–1995 , named for former all - conference quarterback , shortstop and athletic director George Cole .
The field was next to John McDonnell Field , home of the outdoor track and field team , and has since been turned into the practice field for the football team .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Arkansas first fielded a baseball team from 1897 to 1930 .
The modern era of Razorbacks baseball began in 1947 , under Deke Brackett .
Bill Ferrell led the team from 1950 to 1965 , and Wayne Robbins took over from 1966 to 1969 .
In 1970 , Cole hired 28-year - old Norm DeBriyn after another man took the job but resigned after only one day .
DeBriyn inherited a program that played at a dilapidated stadium at the Washington County Fairgrounds , and whose paperwork was contained in a single manila folder .
He immediately set about upgrading the program .
Within three years , he had the Razorbacks in the NCAA Tournament for the first time in school history .
He then persuaded athletic director Frank Broyles to build a new on - campus stadium , George Cole Field .
1979
COLLEGE WORLD SERIES Section::::1979
College World Series .
DeBriyn 's 10th team put the Razorbacks on the national map .
The Razorbacks won 49 games , lost 15 , and finished second in the Southwest Conference ( SWC ) .
The Hogs defeated George Washington , Florida , and Delaware twice to move out of the East Regional ( played at Seminole Stadium in Tallahassee , Florida ) .
The Razorbacks then went to Omaha and defeated Pepperdine , 5 - 4 and an Arizona Wildcats club , with a young Terry Francona , 10 - 3 .
A match - up with SWC champion Texas loomed next for the Razorbacks .
The Hogs had gone 1 - 4 against the Longhorns up to this point in the season .
The Razorbacks prevailed , 9 - 4 , and earned a contest with Cal State Fullerton for a championship .
Texas was eliminated .
Arkansas lost twice to the Titans , 13 - 10 , and 2 - 1 , to give the trophy to Cal State Fullerton .
Freshman Kevin McReynolds was named to the all - tournament team as an outfielder , along with Steve Krueger at pitcher , Larry Wallace at shortstop , and Marc Brumble as an outfielder .
1985
COLLEGE WORLD SERIES Section::::1985
College World Series .
Arkansas came into the South regional hot winning twelve straight games ( last loss against fellow CWS team Mississippi State ) , and winning the SWC tournament with the help of tourney - MVP Dave Patterson .
A 20 - 13 victory over Eastern Kentucky started things off on the right foot for the Hogs .
Wins against George Mason , hometown FSU , and Georgia Tech would push the Hogs to their second College World Series .
Arkansas arrived in Omaha in as dramatic fashion as they left it .
The Diamond Hogs defeated the Gamecocks of South Carolina in a 14 inning affair , 1 - 0 , but Arkansas would lose to Mississippi State three days later , and fall to the loser 's bracket .
Facing elimination , the Razorbacks crushed Stanford 10 - 4 , eliminating the Cardinal from the College World Series .
Now a win away from the Championship series with Miami ( Fl ) , Arkansas had to face Southwest Conference rival Texas .
Said
Razorback third baseman Jeff King of Texas , " We figured we would meet them again .
" The Hogs were 4 - 1 against the Longhorns in 1985 , including two wins in the Southwest Conference Tournament .
Arkansas lead the game 7 - 0 , but the Longhorns battled back and sent the game to extra innings .
Texas '
Bill Bates hit a leadoff triple in the bottom of the tenth inning with the score tied 7 - 7 .
Arkansas coach Norm DeBriyn opted to intentionally walk the bases full and pull the infield in .
Doug Hodo then hit a single past the infielders , allowing Bates to score and the Horns to move on , 8 - 7 in ten innings .
The situation was oddly similar to the last time the Hogs reached the College World Series , except Texas was 4 - 1 against the Hogs in 1979 ( including two SWC tournament wins ) , and Arkansas prevailed in the 1979 CWS match up .
Freshman third baseman Jeff King and
junior outfielder Ralph Kraus were named to the All - College World Series team .

Georgia was led by pitcher Derek Lilliquist ( 14 - 2 ) , who had 19 HR and 60 RBI entering Omaha .
