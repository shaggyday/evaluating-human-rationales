BLUE MOON
A blue moon is an additional full moon that appears in a subdivision of a year : either the third of four full moons in a season , or a second full moon in a month of the common calendar .
The phrase has nothing to do with the actual color of the moon , although a literal " blue moon " ( the moon appearing with a tinge of blue ) may occur in certain atmospheric conditions : e.g. , if volcanic eruptions or fires leave particles in the atmosphere of just the right size to preferentially scatter red light .
DEFINITION Section::::Definition .
The term has traditionally referred to an " extra " full moon , where a year which normally has 12 full moons has 13 instead .
The " blue moon " reference is applied to the third full moon in a season with four full moons , thus correcting the timing of the last month of a season that would have otherwise been expected too early .
This happens every two to three years ( seven times in the Metonic cycle of 19 years ) .
The March 1946 issue of Sky & Telescope misinterpreted the traditional definition , which led to the modern colloquial misunderstanding that a blue moon is a second full moon in a single solar calendar month with no seasonal link .
Owing to the rarity of a blue moon , the term " blue moon " is used colloquially to mean a rare event , as in the phrase " once in a blue moon " .
One lunation ( an average lunar cycle ) is 29.53 days .
There are about 365.24 days in a tropical year .
Therefore , about 12.37 lunations ( 365.24 days divided by 29.53 days ) occur in a tropical year .
In the widely used Gregorian calendar , there are 12 months ( the word month is derived from moon ) in a year , and normally there is one full moon each month .
Each calendar year contains roughly 11 days more than the number of days in 12 lunar cycles .
The extra days accumulate , so every two or three years ( seven times in the 19-year Metonic cycle ) , there is an extra full moon .
The extra full moon necessarily falls in one of the four seasons , giving that season four full moons instead of the usual three , and , hence , a blue moon .

In calculating the dates for Lent and Easter , Catholic clergy identified a Lenten moon .
Historically , when the moons arrived too early , they called the early moon a " betrayer " ( belewe ) moon , so the Lenten moon came at its expected time .
* Folklore named each of the 12 full moons in a year according to its time of year .
The occasional 13th full moon that came too early for its season was called a " blue moon " , so the rest of the moons that year retained their customary seasonal names .
*
The Maine Farmers ' Almanac called the third full moon in a season that had four the " blue moon " .
*
The frequency of a blue moon can be calculated as follows .
It is the period of time it would take for an extra synodic orbit of the moon to occur in a year .
Given that a year is approximately 365.2425 days and a synodic orbit is 29.5309 days , then there are about 12.368 synodic months in a year .
For this to add up to another full month would take 1/0.368 years .
Thus it would take about 2.716 years , or 2 years , 8 months and 18 days for another blue moon to occur .
* Using the common Sky & Telescope misunderstanding , when one calendar month has two full moons ; the second one is called a " blue moon " .
On rare occasions in a calendar year ( as happened in 2010 in time zones east of UTC+07 ) , both January and March each have two full moons , so that the second one in each month is called a " blue moon " ; in this case , the month of February , with only 28 or 29 days , has no full moon .
Under this misinterpretation a blue moon can be more frequent .
ORIGIN OF THE TERM Section::::Origin of the term .
The earliest recorded English usage of the term blue moon is found in an anti - clerical pamphlet ( attacking the Roman clergy , and cardinal Thomas Wolsey in particular ) by two converted Greenwich friars , William Roy and Jerome Barlow , published in 1528 under the title Rede me and be nott wrothe , for I say no thynge but trothe .
The relevant passage reads :
It is not clear from the context that this refers to intercalation ; the context of the passage is a dialogue between two priest 's servants , spoken by the character " Jeffrey "
( a brefe dialoge betwene two preste 's servauntis , named Watkyn and Ieffraye ) .
The intention may simply be that Jeffrey makes an absurd statement , " the moon is blue " , to make the point that priests require laymen to believe in statements even if they are patently false .
' BETRAYER MOON '
SPECULATION
Section::::'Betrayer moon ' speculation .
In 2007 , Joe Rao , Skywatching Columnist at Space.com , stated that many years previously he had speculated in Natural History magazine that the " Blue Moon Rule " might derive from ' belewe ' , which he described as an Old English word meaning ' to betray ' , because the extra full moon " betrays the usual perception of one full moon per month . "
He then added that his speculation had been " innovative " , but " completely wrong " .
In 2009 a less detailed version of this speculation was mentioned in Farmers ' Almanac .
The website www.oldenglishtranslator says that the word ' belæwe ' ( as distinct from ' belewe ' ) is a form of the Old English verb ' belæwan ' ( ' to betray ' ) .
MAINE FARMERS '
ALMANAC BLUE MOONS Section::::Maine Farmers ' Almanac blue moons .
In the 19th and early 20th centuries , the Maine Farmers ' Almanac listed blue moon dates for farmers .
These correspond to the third full moon in a quarter of the year when there were four full moons ( normally a quarter year has three full moons ) .
Full moon names were given to each lunation in a season .
The seasons used were those of the mean tropical year , equal in length , as opposed to the astronomical seasons which vary in length because the earth 's speed in its orbit round the sun is not uniform .
To compare , in 1983 the equal seasons began at 1.48 AM on 23 March , 9.15 AM on 22 June , 4.42 PM on 21 September and 12.10 AM on 22 December , while the astronomical seasons began at 4.39 AM on 21 March , 11.09 PM on 21 June , 2.42 PM on 23 September and 10.30 AM on 22 December ( all times GMT ) .
When a season has four full moons the third is called the " blue moon " so that the last can continue to be called with the proper name for that season .
SKY AND TELESCOPE CALENDAR MISINTERPRETATION
Section::::Sky and Telescope calendar misinterpretation .
The March 1946 Sky and Telescope article " Once in a Blue Moon " by James Hugh Pruett misinterpreted the 1937 Maine Farmers ' Almanac . "
Seven times in 19 years there were – and still are – 13 full moons in a year .
This gives 11 months with one full moon each and one with two .
This second in a month , so I interpret it , was called Blue Moon .
" Widespread adoption of the definition of a " blue moon " as the second full moon in a month followed its use on the popular radio program StarDate on January 31 , 1980 and in a question in the Trivial Pursuit game in 1986 .
VISIBLY BLUE MOON Section::::Visibly blue moon .
The most literal meaning of blue moon is when the moon ( not necessarily a full moon ) appears to a casual observer to be unusually bluish , which is a rare event .
The effect can be caused by smoke or dust particles in the atmosphere , as has happened after forest fires in Sweden and Canada in 1950 and 1951 , and after the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 , which caused the moon to appear blue for nearly two years .
Other less potent volcanoes have also turned the moon blue .
People saw blue moons in 1983 after the eruption of the El Chichón volcano in Mexico , and there are reports of blue moons caused by Mount St. Helens in 1980 and Mount Pinatubo in 1991 .
In the Antarctic diary of Robert Falcon Scott for July 11 , 1911 his entry says , " ...
the air thick with snow , and the moon a vague blue " .
On that date the moon phase would have looked full .
On September 23 , 1950 , several muskeg fires that had been smoldering for several years in Alberta , Canada , suddenly blew up into major — and very smoky — fires .
Winds carried the smoke eastward and southward with unusual speed , and the conditions of the fire produced large quantities of oily droplets of just the right size ( about 1 micrometre in diameter ) to scatter red and yellow light .
Wherever the smoke cleared enough so that the sun was visible , it was lavender or blue .
Ontario , Canada , and much of the east coast of the United States were affected by the following day , and two days later , observers in Britain reported an indigo sun in smoke - dimmed skies , followed by an equally blue moon that evening .
The key to a blue moon is having lots of particles slightly wider than the wavelength of red light ( 0.7 micrometer)—and no other sizes present .
It is rare , but volcanoes sometimes produce such clouds , as do forest fires .
Ash and dust clouds thrown into the atmosphere by fires and storms usually contain a mixture of particles with a wide range of sizes , with most smaller than 1 micrometer , and they tend to scatter blue light .
This kind of cloud makes the moon turn red ; thus red moons are far more common than blue moons .
BLUE MOONS BETWEEN 2009 AND 2021 Section::::Blue moons between 2009 and 2021 .
The following blue moons occur between 2009 and 2021 .
These dates use UTC as the timezone ; exact dates vary with different timezones .
SEASONAL Section::::Seasonal .
Using the Maine Farmers ' Almanac definition of blue moon ( meaning the third full moon in a season of four full moons , but referenced to astronomical rather than equal seasons ) , blue moons have occurred or will occur on :
* November 21 , 2010
* August 20 , 2013
* May 21 , 2016 * May 18 , 2019 * August 22 , 2021 CALENDAR Section::::Calendar .
Unlike the astronomical seasonal definition , these dates are dependent on the Gregorian calendar and time zones .
Two full moons in one month ( the second of which is a " blue moon " ) :
* 2009 : December 2 and 31 ( partial lunar eclipse visible in some parts of the world ) , only in time zones west of UTC+05 .
* 2010 : January 1 ( partial lunar eclipse ) and 30 , only in time zones east of .
* 2010 : March 1 and 30 , only in time zones east of UTC+07 .
* 2012 : August 2 and 31 , only in time zones west of UTC+10 .
* 2012 : September 1 and 30 , only in time zones east of .
* 2015 : July 2 and 31 .
* 2018 : January 2 and 31 , only in time zones west of UTC+11 .
* 2018 : March 2 and 31 , only in time zones west of
UTC+12 .
* 2020 : October 1 and 31 , only in time zones west of UTC+10 .
The next time New Year 's Eve falls on a Blue Moon ( as occurred on December 31 , 2009 in time zones west of UTC+05 ) is after one Metonic cycle , in 2028 in time zones west of UTC+08 .
At that time there will be a total lunar eclipse .
