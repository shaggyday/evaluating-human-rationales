NBA DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR AWARD
The NBA 's Defensive Player of the Year Award is an annual National Basketball Association ( NBA ) award given since the 1982â€“83 NBA season to the best defensive player of the regular season .
The winner is selected by a panel of 124 sportswriters and broadcasters throughout the United States and Canada , each of whom casts a vote for first , second and third place selections .
Each first - place vote is worth five points , second - place voted are worth three points , and a third - place vote is worth one .
The player with the highest point total , regardless of the number of first - place votes , wins the award .
Since its inception , the award has been given to 21 different players .
Dikembe Mutombo and Ben Wallace have each won the award a record four times .
Dwight Howard is the only player to have won the award in three consecutive seasons .
Sidney Moncrief , Mark Eaton , Dennis Rodman , Hakeem Olajuwon , Alonzo Mourning , and Kawhi Leonard have each won it twice .
The most recent award recipient is Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz .
Although five of the first six winners were perimeter players , the award has traditionally been given to big men who rebound and block shots .
Only seven perimeter players have been honored : Moncrief , Alvin Robertson , Michael Cooper , Michael Jordan , Gary Payton , Ron Artest ( known now as Metta World Peace ) , and Kawhi Leonard .
Payton is the only point guard to have won .
Jordan , Olajuwon , David Robinson , and Kevin Garnett are the only Defensive Player of the Year winners to have won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award ( MVP ) during their careers ; Jordan and Olajuwon won both awards in the same season .
In Olajuwon 's case , he is the only one to have also won the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award and the NBA championship in the same season .
On four occasions , the Defensive Player of the Year recipient was not voted to the NBA All - Defensive First Team in the same year .
Robertson in 1986 , Mutombo ( 1995 ) , Tyson Chandler ( 2012 ) , and Marc Gasol ( 2013 ) were instead named to the second team .
Whereas the Defensive Player of the Year is voted on by the media , the All - Defensive teams were voted on by NBA coaches prior to 2014 .
Frenchman Rudy Gobert is the only winner who was trained completely outside the U.S. Out of the other three winners born outside the U.S. , Mutombo and Olajuwon both played U.S. college basketball , and Gasol played U.S. high school basketball .
Joakim Noah , who has played for the French national team , was born in New York City and played both high school and college basketball in the U.S.
