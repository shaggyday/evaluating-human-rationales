The tour received positive reviews from music critics .
Mark Lewis ( American River Current ) gave the show in Sacramento a rating of " love it " and said : " Put simply , BTR delivered on the hype that incited a crowd of young women to travel from as far as Fresno to catch a glimpse of their fresh - faced idols .
Sacramento 's Memorial Auditorium was filled to capacity over two hours before
Kendall , James , Carlos and Logan took the stage " .
Carin Lane 's ( Times Union ) eight - year - old son described the show in Albany as the " best night ever " .
She wrote : " These guys can sing and move , as the show was well - choreographed on a stage that included a massive , three - tiered scaffolding with ramps , a walkway , two towers and a trampoline " .
