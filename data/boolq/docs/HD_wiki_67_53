DATE AND TIME NOTATION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM Date and time notation in the United Kingdom records the date using the day - month - year format ( 21 October 2011 or 21/10/11 ) .
The ISO 8601 format ( 2011 - 10 - 21 ) is increasingly used for all - numeric dates .
The time can be written using either the 24-hour clock ( 16:10 ) or 12-hour clock ( 4.10 p.m. ) .
DATE ENGLISH Section::::Date .
Section::::English .
Dates are traditionally written in " day month year " ( DMY ) order : * 31 December 1999 * 31/12/99 Formal style manuals discourage writing the day of the month as an ordinal number ( for example " 31st December " ) , except with an incomplete reference , such as " They set off on 12 August 1960 and arrived on the 18th " .
When saying the date , it is usually pronounced using " the " , then the ordinal number of the day first , then the preposition " of " , then the month ( for example " the thirty - first of December " ) .
The month - first form ( for example " December the third " ) was widespread until the mid twentieth - century , and remains the most common format for newspapers across the United Kingdom .
The month - first format is still spoken , perhaps more commonly when not including a year in the sentence , but is now less frequently used .
ALL - NUMERIC DATES Section::::All - numeric dates .
All - numeric dates are used in notes and references , but not running prose .
They can be written in several forms : * 31/12/99 or 31.12.99 * 31 .
xii .
99 * 1999 - 12 - 31
The date in the day - month - year
( dd / mm / yy ) sequence can be written with either an oblique or a point :
2/11/03 or 2.11.03 represents 2 November 2003 .
The year may also be written in full ( 2/11/2003 ) .
It contrasts with date and time notation in the United States , where the month is placed first , leading to confusion in international communications : there , 2/11/03 would be interpreted as 11 February 2003 .
To remedy this , the month is sometimes written in Roman numerals , as common on the Continent : 2 .
xi . 03 .
This format , however , is not machine - readable .
The ISO 8601 format ( adopted as British Standard BS ISO 8601:2004 ) is unambiguous and machine - readable , and increasingly popular in technical , scientific , financial , and computing contexts .
The Government Digital Service requires it for all forms of data transmission .
Dates in this format are separated with hyphens : 2003 - 11 - 02 .
WEEKS Section::::Weeks .
Weeks are generally referred to by the date on which they start , with Monday often treated as the first day of the week , for example " the week commencing 5 March " .
Some more traditional calendars instead treat Sunday as the first day or the week .
ISO 8601 week numbers are found in diaries and are used in business .
WELSH Section::::Welsh .
The " day month year " order is also used in modern Welsh : * or The " month day year " order ( for example " ") was previously more common , it not being unusual to see a Welsh " month day year " date next to an English " day month year " date on a bilingual plaque from the latter half of the 20th century .
" " is read as with the usual soft mutation of M to F after O ( of ) .
The year 1999 can be read as either ( thousand nine nine nine ) or ( one nine nine nine ) .
TIME
ENGLISH Section::::Time .
Section::::English .
Both the 24-hour and 12-hour notations are used in the United Kingdom :
* 16:30 or 16.30 * 4.30 p.m.
The 24-hour notation is used in timetables and on most digital clocks , but 12-hour notation is still widely used in ordinary life .
The 24-hour notation is used more often than in North America – bus , rail , and airline timetables use it exclusively – but not as commonly as in much of the non - English - speaking world .
The BBC has been using 24-hour notation in its online radio and TV guides for many years , though ITV , Channel 4 , and Channel 5 still maintain 12-hour notation .
It is rare to use the 24-hour format when speaking ; 21:30 is colloquially spoken as " half past nine " rather than " twenty - one thirty " .
The spoken 24-hour format is used in airport and railway station announcements : " We regret to inform that the fifteen hundred [ 15:00 ] service from Nottingham is running approximately 10 minutes late " ; " The next train arriving at Platform four is the twenty - fifteen [ 20:15 ] service to London Euston " .
To separate different parts of time , either a full point or a colon can be used .
For 12-hour time , the point format ( for example " 1.45 p.m. " ) is in common usage and has been recommended by some style guides , including the academic manual published by Oxford University Press under various titles , as well as the internal house style book for the University of Oxford , that of The Guardian and The Times newspapers .
The colon format ( as in " 1:45 p.m. " ) is also recognised and is common in digital devices and applications .
The more descriptive 2014 revision of New Hart 's Rules concedes that the colon format " is often seen in British usage too " , and that either style " is acceptable if applied consistently . "
The time - of - day abbreviations are handled in various conflicting styles , including " a.m. " and " p.m. " with a space between the time and the abbreviation ( " 1.45 p.m. " ) ; " am " and " pm " with a space ( " 1.45 pm " – recognised as an alternative usage by Oxford ) ; and the same without a space ( " 1.45pm " – primarily found in news writing ) .
In 24-hour time , a colon is internationally standard ( as in " 13:45 " ) .
Some British news publishers favour " 13.45 " format instead , such as The Guardian .
Some stick with the colon , including the Evening Standard and the BBC .
Oxford recognises both styles .
The a.m. and p.m. abbreviations are not used with 24-hour time in any form .
In British English , the expression " half [ hour ] " is used colloquially to denote 30 minutes past the hour .
For example , " half ten " means 10:30 ( without specifying morning or night ) .
This contrasts with the Dutch , German , Hungarian , Czech , Serbian , Baltic , and Scandinavian languages , where the same type of expression denotes 30 minutes the hour .
For example , ( in Czech ) " half ten " means 9:30 .
The following table shows times written in some common approaches to 12-hour and 24-hour notation , and how each time is typically spoken : !
12-hour ! !
24-hour ! !
Spoken WELSH Section::::Welsh .
The Welsh language usage of the 12-hour and 24-hour clocks is similar to that of UK English above .
However , the 24-hour notation has only a written , not a spoken form .
For example , written 9:00 and 21:00 ( or 09.00 , etc . )
are said ( , literally ' nine of the bell ' ) .
Minutes are always either ( ' after ' ) or ( ' to ' )
the hour , for example 21:18 ( ' eighteen ( minutes ) past nine ' ) and 21:42 ( ' eighteen ( minutes ) to ten ' ) .
Phrases such as ( ' ( of ) the morning ' ) , ( ' ( of ) the afternoon ' ) and
( ' ( of ) the evening ' ) are used to distinguish times in 12-hour notation , much like Latin a.m. and p.m. , which are also in common use , for example ( 09:00 ) as opposed to ( 21:00 ) .
