LAST POST
The " Last Post " is either a B ♭ bugle call within British infantry regiments , or an E ♭ cavalry trumpet call in British cavalry and Royal Regiment of Artillery ( Royal Horse Artillery and Royal Artillery ) , and is used at Commonwealth military funerals , and ceremonies commemorating those who have been killed in war .
Its duration varies typically from a little over one minute to nearly three minutes .
For ceremonial use , the Last Post is often followed by " The Rouse " , or less usually the longer " Reveille " .
The two regimental traditions have separate music for the call ( see Trumpet & Bugle Calls for the British Army 1966 ) .
While the B ♭ infantry bugle version is better known , the E ♭ cavalry trumpet version is used by the state trumpeters of the Household Cavalry .
ORIGIN AND WARTIME USE Section::::Origin and wartime use .
The " First Post " call signals the start of the duty officer 's inspection of a British Army camp 's sentry posts , sounding a call at each one .
The " Last Post " call originally signalled merely that the final sentry post had been inspected , and the camp was secure for the night .
In addition to its normal garrison use , the Last Post call had another function at the close of a day of battle .
It signalled to those who were still out and wounded or separated that the fighting was done , and to follow the sound of the call to find safety and rest .
Its use in Remembrance Day ceremonies in Commonwealth nations has two generally unexpressed purposes : the first is an implied summoning of the spirits of the Fallen to the cenotaph , the second is to symbolically end the day , so that the period of silence before the Rouse is blown becomes in effect a ritualised night vigil .
The Last Post as played at the end of inspection typically lasted for about 45 seconds ; when played ceremonially with notes held for longer , pauses extended , and the expression mournful , typical duration could be 75 seconds or more .
This custom dates from the 17th century or earlier .
It originated with British troops stationed in the Netherlands , where it drew on an older Dutch custom , called taptoe , from which comes the term Tattoo as in Military tattoo .
The taptoe was also used to signal the end of the day , but originated from a signal that beer taps had to be shut , hence that the day had ended .
It comes from the Dutch phrase Doe den tap toe , meaning " Close the tap " .
The Dutch bugle call , now used for remembrance events , is not the same tune as the Last Post .
The " Last Post " was used by British forces in North America in colonial times , but was replaced by the different " Taps " by the United States Army , first used in 1862 and officially recognized in 1874 .
MEMORIAL USAGE Section::::Memorial usage .
During the 19th century , the " Last Post " was also carried to the various countries of the British Empire .
In all these countries , it has been incorporated into military funerals , where it is played as a final farewell , symbolising the fact that the duty of the dead soldier is over and that they can rest in peace .
" Last Post " is used in public ceremonials commemorating the war dead , particularly on Remembrance Day in the Commonwealth of Nations .
In Australia and New Zealand
it is also played on Anzac Day , usually before the two - minute silence , which concludes with " The Rouse " .
When the post is played during services such as Anzac Day , it is required of all current serving military members to salute for the duration of the call .
During services organised by the Royal British Legion , it is expected that no salute is given during the " Last Post " and Silence , as all personnel will have removed head dress as in church service prayer , have heads bowed , weapons inverted , and flags and standards lowered .
MENIN GATE Section::::Menin Gate .
Since 1928 , the " Last Post " has been played every evening at 8 p.m. by buglers of the local Last Post Association at the war memorial at Ypres in Belgium known as the Menin Gate , commemorating the British Empire dead at the Battle of Ypres during the First World War .
The only exception to this was during the four years of the German occupation of Ypres from 20 May 1940 to 6 September 1944 , when the ceremony moved to Brookwood Cemetery in England .
On the evening that Polish forces liberated Ypres , the ceremony was resumed at the Menin Gate , in spite of the heavy fighting still going on in other parts of the town .
These buglers or trumpeters , sometimes seen in fire brigade uniform , are members of the fire brigade representing the Last Post Association , who organizes the events .
The Last Post Association uses both silver B ♭ bugles and E ♭ cavalry trumpets , with either British Army tradition being respected during services at the gate .
The Last Post ceremony has now been held more than 30,000 times .
On 9 July 2015 , a ceremony titled A tribute to the tribute took place to commemorate the 30,000th ceremony .
