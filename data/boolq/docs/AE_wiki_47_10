THE A - TEAM
The A - Team is an American action - adventure television series that ran on NBC from 1983 to 1987 about former members of a fictitious United States Army Special Forces unit .
The members , after being court - martialed " for a crime they did n't commit " , escaped from military prison and , while still on the run , worked as soldiers of fortune .
The series was created by Stephen J. Cannell and Frank Lupo .
A feature film based on the series was released by 20th Century Fox in 2010 .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The A - Team was created by writers and producers Stephen J. Cannell and Frank Lupo at the behest of Brandon Tartikoff , NBC 's Entertainment president .
Cannell was fired from ABC in the early 1980s , after failing to produce a hit show for the network , and was hired by NBC ; his first project was The A - Team .
Brandon Tartikoff pitched the series to Cannell as a combination of The Dirty Dozen , Mission Impossible , The Magnificent Seven , Mad Max and Hill Street Blues , with " Mr. T driving the car " .
The A - Team was not generally expected to become a hit , although Stephen J. Cannell has said that George Peppard suggested it would be a huge hit " before we ever turned on a camera " .
The show became very popular ; the first regular episode , which aired after Super Bowl XVII on January 30 , 1983 , reached 26.4 % of the television audience , placing fourth in the top 10 Nielsen - rated shows .
The A - Team was portrayed as acting on the side of good and helping the oppressed .
The show remains prominent in popular culture for its cartoonish violence ( in which people were seldom seriously hurt )
, formulaic episodes , its characters ' ability to form weaponry and vehicles out of old parts , and its distinctive theme tune .
The show boosted the career of Mr. T , who portrayed the character of B. A. Baracus , around whom the show was initially conceived .
Some of the show 's catchphrases , such as " I love it when a plan comes together " , " Hannibal 's on the jazz " , and " I ai n't gettin ' on no plane ! " have also made their way onto T - shirts and other merchandise .
The show 's name comes from the " A - Teams " , the nickname coined for U.S. Special Forces ' Operational Detachments Alpha ( ODA ) during the Vietnam War , although this connection was never mentioned on - screen .
In a 2003 Yahoo ! survey of 1,000 television viewers , The A - Team was voted the " oldie " television show viewers would most like to see revived , beating out such popular television series from the 1980s as The Dukes of Hazzard and Knight Rider .
PLOT Section::::Plot .
The A - Team is a naturally episodic show , with few overarching stories , except the characters ' continuing motivation to clear their names , with few references to events in past episodes and a recognizable and steady episode structure .
In describing the ratings drop that occurred during the show 's fourth season , reviewer Gold Burt points to this structure as being a leading cause for the decreased popularity " because the same basic plot had been used over and over again for the past four seasons with the same predictable outcome " .
Similarly , reporter Adrian Lee called the plots " stunningly simple " in a 2006 article for The Express ( UK newspaper ) , citing such recurring elements " as BA 's fear of flying , and outlandish finales when the team fashioned weapons from household items " .
The show became emblematic of this kind of " fit - for - TV warfare " due to its depiction of high - octane combat scenes , with lethal weapons , wherein the participants ( with the notable exception of General Fulbright ) are never killed and rarely seriously injured ( see also On - screen violence section ) .
As the television ratings of The A - Team fell dramatically during the fourth season , the format was changed for the show 's final season in 1986–87 in a bid to win back viewers .
After years on the run from the authorities , the A - Team is finally apprehended by the military .
General Hunt Stockwell , a mysterious CIA operative played by Robert Vaughn , propositions them to work for him , whereupon he will arrange for their pardons upon successful completion of several suicide missions .
In order to do so , the A - Team must first escape from their captivity .
With the help of a new character , Frankie " Dishpan Man " Santana , Stockwell fakes their deaths before a military firing squad .
The new status of the A - Team , no longer working for themselves , remained for the duration of the fifth season while Eddie Velez and Robert Vaughn received star billing along with the principal cast .
The missions that the team had to perform in season five were somewhat reminiscent of , and based more around political espionage than beating local thugs , also usually taking place in foreign countries , including successfully overthrowing an island dictator , the rescue of a scientist from East Germany , and recovering top secret Star Wars defense information from Soviet hands .
These changes proved unsuccessful with viewers , however , and ratings continued to decline .
Only 13 episodes aired in the fifth season .
In what was supposed to be the final episode , " The Grey Team " ( although " Without Reservations " was broadcast on NBC as the last first - run episode in March 1987 ) , Hannibal , after being misled by Stockwell one time too many , tells him that the team will no longer work for him .
At the end , the team discusses what they were going to do if they get their pardon , and it is implied that they would continue doing what they were doing as the A - Team .
The character of Howling Mad Murdock can be seen in the final scene wearing a T - shirt that says , " Fini " .
CONNECTIONS TO THE VIETNAM WAR Section::::Connections to the Vietnam War .
During the Vietnam War , the A - Team were members of the 5th Special Forces Group ( see the episode " West Coast Turnaround " ) .
In the episode " Bad Time on the Border " , Colonel John " Hannibal " Smith , portrayed by George Peppard , indicated that the A - Team were " ex - Green Berets " .
During the Vietnam War , the A - Team 's commanding officer , Colonel Morrison , gave them orders to rob the Bank of Hanoi to help bring the war to an end .
They succeeded in their mission , but on their return to base four days after the end of the war , they discovered that Morrison had been killed by the Viet Cong , and that his headquarters had been burned to the ground .
This meant that the proof that the A - Team members were acting under orders had been destroyed .
They were arrested , and imprisoned at Fort Bragg , from which they quickly escaped before standing trial .
The origin of the A - Team is directly linked to the Vietnam War , during which the team formed .
The show 's introduction in the first four seasons mentions this , accompanied by images of soldiers coming out of a helicopter in an area resembling a forest or jungle .
Besides this , The A - Team would occasionally feature an episode in which the team came across an old ally or enemy from those war days .
For example , the first season 's final episode " A Nice Place To Visit " revolved around the team traveling to a small town to honor a fallen comrade and end up avenging his death , and in season two 's " Recipe For Heavy Bread " , a chance encounter leads the team to meet both the POW cook who helped them during the war , and the American officer who sold his unit out .
An article in the New Statesman ( UK ) published shortly after the premiere of The A - Team in the United Kingdom , also pointed out The A - Team 's connection to the Vietnam War , characterizing it as the representation of the idealization of the Vietnam War , and an example of the war slowly becoming accepted and assimilated into American culture .
One of the team 's primary antagonists , Col . Roderick Decker ( Lance LeGault ) , had his past linked back to the Vietnam War , in which he and Hannibal had come to fisticuffs in " the DOOM Club " ( Da Nang Open Officers ' Mess ) .
At other times , members of the team would refer back to a certain tactic used during the War , which would be relevant to the team 's present predicament .
Often , Hannibal would refer to such a tactic , after which the other members of the team would complain about its failure during the War .
This was also used to refer to some of Face 's past accomplishments in scamming items for the team , such as in the first - season episode " Holiday In The Hills " , in which Murdock fondly remembers Face being able to secure a ' 53 Cadillac while in the Vietnam jungle .
The team 's ties to the Vietnam War were referred to again in the fourth - season finale , " The Sound of Thunder " , in which the team is introduced to Tia ( Tia Carrere ) , a war orphan and daughter of fourth season antagonist General Fulbright .
Returning to Vietnam , Fulbright is shot in the back and gives his last words as he dies .
The 2006 documentary Bring Back The A - Team joked that the scene lasted seven and a half minutes , but his death actually took a little over a minute .
His murderer , a Vietnamese colonel , is killed in retaliation .
Tia then returns with the team to the United States ( see also : casting ) .
This episode is notable for having one of the show 's few truly serious dramatic moments , with each team member privately reminiscing on their war experiences , intercut with news footage from the war with Barry McGuire 's Eve of Destruction playing in the background .
The show 's ties to the Vietnam War are fully dealt with in the opening arc of the fifth season , dubbed " The Court - Martial ( Part 1–3 ) " , in which the team is finally court - martialed for the robbery of the bank of Hanoi .
The character of Roderick Decker makes a return on the witness stand , and various newly introduced characters from the A - Team 's past also make appearances .
The team , after a string of setbacks , decides to plead guilty to the crime and they are sentenced to be executed .
They escape this fate and come to work for a General Hunt Stockwell , leading into the remainder of the fifth season .
EPISODES
Section::::Episodes .
The show ran for five seasons on the NBC television network , from January 23 , 1983 to December 30 , 1986 ( with one additional , previously unbroadcast episode shown on March 8 , 1987 ) , for a total of 98 episodes .
CHARACTERS
Section::::Characters .
The A - Team revolves around the four members of a former commando outfit , now mercenaries .
Their leader is Lieutenant Colonel / Colonel John " Hannibal " Smith ( George Peppard ) , whose plans tend to be unorthodox but effective .
Lieutenant Templeton Peck ( Dirk Benedict ; Tim Dunigan appeared as Templeton Peck in the pilot ) , usually called " Face " or " Faceman " , is a smooth - talking con man who serves as the team 's appropriator of vehicles and other useful items , as well as the team 's second - in - command .
The team 's pilot is Captain H.M. " Howling Mad " Murdock ( Dwight Schultz ) , who has been declared insane and lives in a Veterans ' Administration mental institution for the show 's first four seasons .
Finally , there is the team 's strong man , mechanic and Sergeant First Class Bosco " B.A. " , or " Bad Attitude " , Baracus ( Mr. T ) .
The team belonged to the 5th Special Forces as seen in the left side shoulder patch on Hannibal 's uniform in the episode A Nice Place to Visit .
A patch on Hannibal 's uniform on the right shoulder in the episode " A Nice Place To Visit " indicates he belonged to the 101st Airborne during a prior combat assignment , but that patch was replaced by the 1st Air Cavalry Division patch in the episode " Trial by Fire " .
The patch worn on the left sleeve according to uniform wear in the Army is the current assignment of the person wearing it and in the episode
A Nice Place to Visit shows that the team was assigned to the Special Forces with a tab Airborne over the shoulder patch .
Also their berets in that episode are green and have the tab of the 5th Special Forces in Vietnam on them .
In the episode " West Coast Turnaround " , Hannibal stated they were with the 5th Special Forces Group .
Then , in episode " Bad Time on the Border " , Hannibal refers to his friends as " ex - Green Berets " .
Though the name they have adopted comes from the " A - Teams " , the nickname coined for Special Forces Operational Detachments Alpha , these detachments usually consisted of twelve members ; whether the four were considered a " detachment " of their own or had once had eight compatriots who were killed in action was never revealed .
In the episode A Nice Place to Visit Ray Brenner is stated to have been a Major and part of Hannibal 's team in Vietnam .
For its first season and the first half of the second season , the team was assisted by reporter Amy Amanda Allen ( Melinda Culea ) .
In the second half of the second season , Allen was replaced by fellow reporter Tawnia Baker ( Marla Heasley ) .
The character of Tia ( Tia Carrere ) , a Vietnam war orphan now living in the United States , was meant to join the Team in the fifth season , but she was replaced by Frankie Santana ( Eddie Velez ) , who served as the team 's special effects expert .
Velez was added to the opening credits of the fifth season after its second episode .
During their adventures , the A - Team was constantly met by opposition from the Military Police .
In the show 's first season , the MPs were led by Colonel Francis Lynch ( William Lucking ) , but he was replaced for the second , third , and earlier fourth season by Colonel Roderick Decker ( Lance LeGault ) and his aide Captain Crane ( Carl Franklin ) .
Lynch returned for one episode in the show 's third season ( " Showdown ! " ) but was not seen after .
Decker was also briefly replaced by a Colonel Briggs ( Charles Napier ) in the third season for one episode ( " Fire " ) when LeGault was unavailable , but returned shortly after .
For the latter portion of the show 's fourth season , the team was hunted by General Harlan " Bull " Fulbright ( Jack Ging ) , who would later hire the A - Team to find Tia in the season four finale , during which Fulbright was killed .
The fifth season introduced General Hunt Stockwell ( Robert Vaughn ) who , while serving as the team 's primary antagonist , was also the team 's boss and joined them on several missions .
He was often assisted by Carla ( Judith Ledford , sometimes credited as Judy Ledford ) .
CHARACTER TRAITS
Section::::Character traits .
John " Hannibal " Smith is a master of disguise .
His most used disguise ( onscreen only on the pilot episode ) is Mr. Lee , the dry cleaner .
This is one of the final parts of the client screening process , as he tells the client where to go in order to make full contact with the A - Team .
He dresses most often in a white safari jacket and black leather gloves .
He also is constantly seen smoking a cigar .
Hannibal carries either a Browning Hi - Power , Colt M1911A1 or a Smith & Wesson Model 39 as a sidearm , most often " Mexican carried " although he uses a holster when on missions .
His catchphrase is " I love it when a plan comes together " .
Often said , usually by B.A. , to be " on the jazz " when in the fury of completing a mission .
Templeton " Faceman " Peck is a master of the persuasive arts .
The team 's scrounger , he can get virtually anything he sets his mind to , usually exploiting women with sympathy - appeal and flirtation .
However , he is not without integrity , as stated by Murdock in the episode " Family Reunion " : " He would rip the shirt off his back for you , and then scam one for himself . "
Faceman is also the A - Team 's accountant .
He dresses suavely , often appearing in suits .
Faceman carries a Colt Lawman Mk III revolver for protection , and drives a custom white 1984 Corvette with red trim .
Bosco " B.A. " ( Bad Attitude )
Baracus is the muscle for the A - Team , able to perform exceptional feats of strength .
He is also the team 's mechanic .
Baracus affects a dislike for Murdock , calling him a " crazy fool " , but his true feelings of friendship are revealed when he prevents Murdock from drowning in his desire to live like a fish .
Baracus also has a deep fear of flying , and the others usually have to trick and/or knock him out in order to get him on an aircraft .
It is very rare that Baracus is awake while flying , and even rarer for him actually to consent to it .
When he does , however , he then goes into a catatonic state .
Baracus generally wears overalls and leopard or tiger print shirts in the early seasons , then later wears a green jumpsuit in the later seasons .
He is almost always seen with about 50 pounds of gold necklaces , rings on every finger , and also wears a weightlifting belt .
Baracus ' hair is always styled in a mohawk - like cut .
He drives a customized black GMC van that acts as the team 's usual mode of transport .
H.M.
" Howling Mad " Murdock is the A - Team 's pilot , and can fly any kind of aircraft with considerable skill .
However , due to a helicopter crash in Vietnam , Murdock apparently went insane .
He lives in a Veterans ' Hospital in the mental wing .
Whenever the rest of the team requires a pilot , they have to break him out of the hospital , generally using Faceman to do so .
In Seasons 1–4 , Murdock has a different pet , imaginary friend , or persona in each episode .
Whenever one of his pets or imaginary friends is killed by an enemy , Murdock snaps and takes revenge ( but never kills ) .
Many times , when Baracus is mad at Murdock for being crazy , Hannibal will side with Murdock in a sympathetic way .
Once he is discharged from the hospital in Season 5 , Murdock has a different job each episode .
Murdock usually wears a leather flight jacket , a baseball cap , and basketball sneakers .
CASTING
Section::::Casting .
Although the part of Face was written by Frank Lupo and Stephen J. Cannell with Dirk Benedict in mind , NBC insisted that the part should be played by another actor , instead .
Therefore , in the pilot , Face was portrayed by Tim Dunigan , who was later replaced by Dirk Benedict , with the comment that Dunigan was " too tall and too young " .
According to Dunigan : " I look even younger on camera than I am .
So it was difficult to accept me as a veteran of the Vietnam War , which ended when I was a sophomore in high school . "
Carrere was intended to join the principal cast of the show in its fifth season after appearing in the season four finale , providing a tie to the team 's inception during the war .
Unfortunately for this plan , Carrere was under contract to General Hospital , which prevented her from joining The A - Team .
Her character was abruptly dropped as a result .
According to Mr. T 's account in Bring Back ...
The A - Team in 2006 , the role of B. A. Baracus was written specifically for him .
This is corroborated by Stephen J. Cannell 's own account of the initial concept proposed by Tartikoff .
James Coburn , who co - starred in The Magnificent Seven , was considered for the role of Hannibal in The A - Team , while George Peppard ( Hannibal ) was the original consideration for the role of Vin ( played by Steve McQueen instead ) in The Magnificent Seven .
Robert Vaughn , of course , actually appeared in the film .

INTERNATIONAL Section::::International .
The A - Team has been broadcast all over the world ; international response has been varied .
In 1984 , the main cast members of The A - Team , George Peppard , Mr. T , Dirk Benedict and Dwight Schultz were invited to the Netherlands .
George Peppard was the first to receive the invitation and thus thought the invitation applied only to him .
When the other cast members were also invited , Peppard declined , leaving only Mr. T , Benedict and Schultz to visit the Netherlands .
The immense turn - out for the stars was unforeseen , and they were forced to leave early as a security measure .
A video was released with the present actors in which Dwight Schultz apologized and thanked everyone that had attended .
In Australia
The A - Team was broadcast on Channel Ten .
From 2010 7mate has been showing reruns of show .
The show was broadcast in New Zealand on TV2 .
In Brazil , the series was broadcast on SBT from 1984 to 1989 , later moving to Rede Globo in the early 1990s .
In the UK , the program was shown on ITV , starting on Friday , July 22 , 1983 ; when it returned for its second run ( resuming mid - second season )
it moved to Saturday evenings .
The series continued to be repeated on ITV until 1994 .
The series was later repeated on UK Gold from 1997 through 2007 at various times .
It was also repeated on Bravo from 1997 to 1999 .
It returned to the channel in 2008 until the channel 's closure in 2011 .
In 2017 the digital channel Spike began showing the series from the beginning .
Channel 5 also repeated it in 2017 .
Although ratings soared during its early seasons , many television critics described the show largely as cartoonish and thereby wrote the series off .
Most reviews focused on acting and the formulaic nature of the episodes , most prominently the absence of actual killing in a show about Vietnam War veterans .
CRITICISMS ON - SCREEN
VIOLENCE Section::::Criticisms . Section::::On - screen violence .
The violence presented in The A - Team is highly sanitized .
People do not bleed or bruise when hit ( though they might develop a limp or require a sling ) , nor do the members of the A - Team kill people .
The results of violence were only ever presented when it was required for the script .
In almost every car crash there is a short take showing the occupants of the vehicle climbing out of the mangled or burning wreck , even in helicopter crashes .
However , more of these types of takes were dropped near the end of the fourth season .
According to Stephen J. Cannell , this part of the show did become a running joke for the writing staff and they would at times test the limits of realism on purpose .
The show has been described as cartoonish and likened to Tom and Jerry .
Dean P. of the Courier - Mail described the violence in the show as " hypocritical " and that " the morality of giving the impression that a hail of bullets does no - one any harm is ignored .
After all , Tom and Jerry survived all sorts of mayhem for years with no ill - effects .
"
Television reviewer Ric Meyers joked that the A - Team used " antineutron bullets — they destroy property for miles around , but never harm a human being " .
According to certain estimates , an episode of the A - Team held up to 46 violent acts .
Stephen J. Cannell , co - creator of the show responds : " They were determined to make a point , and we were too big a target to resist .
Cartoon violence is a scapegoat issue .
"
Originally , The A - Team 's status as a hit show remained strong , but it ultimately lost out to more family - oriented shows such as The Cosby Show , Who 's the Boss ?
and Growing Pains .
John J. O'Connor of The New York Times wrote in a 1986 article that " ... a substantial number of viewers , if the ratings in recent months are to be believed , are clearly fed up with mindless violence of the car - chasing , fist - slugging variety " .
SEXISM Section::::Sexism .
During its tenure , the show was occasionally criticized for being sexist .
These critiques were based on the notion that most female roles on the show were either a lead - in to the episode 's plot , the recipient of Face 's affections , or both .
The only two regular female members of the cast , Melinda Culea ( season 1 and the first half of season 2 ) and Marla Heasley ( the latter half of season 2 ) did not have long tenures with the show .
Both Culea and Heasley had been brought in by the network and producers to stem these critiques , hoping that a female character would properly balance the otherwise all - male cast .
Culea was fired during the second season because of creative differences between her and the show 's writers ; she wanted more lines and more action scenes .
Culea 's character of Amy Allen suddenly disappeared between two episodes , and was only briefly referred to once in the episode " In Plane Sight " , and a couple of times in " The Battle of Bel Air " in which she was cited to have taken a correspondence job overseas ( in Jakarta , Indonesia ) .
The latter episode also introduced Heasley 's character , Tawnia Baker .
The new character was also an assisting reporter character , but with a more fragile and seductive quality to her .
Ultimately , she was written out of the show at the start of the third season when the network determined that a female cast member was not necessary .
Tawnia left the team on - screen , choosing to marry and move out of Los Angeles .
As Marla Heasley recounts in Bring Back ...
The A - Team ( May 18 , 2006 ) ,
although sexism was not prevalent on the set per se , there was a sense that a female character was not necessary on the show .
On her first day on set George Peppard took her aside and told her " We do n't want you on the show .
None of the guys want you here .
The only reason you 're here is because the network and the producers want you .
For some reason they think they need a girl .
"
The interview continues with Heasley noting that on her last day of work Peppard took her aside again , saying : " I 'm sorry that this is your last day , but remember what I said the very first day , that we did n't want a girl , has nothing to do with you .
You were very professional , but no reason to have a girl . "
In Bring Back ... the A - Team , Dirk Benedict also remarked that : " It was a guy 's show .
It was male driven .
It was written by guys .
It was directed by guys .
It was acted by guys .
It 's about what guys do .
We talked the way guys talked .
We were the boss .
We were the God .
We smoked when we wanted .
We shot guns when we wanted .
We kissed the girls and made them cry ... when we wanted .
It was the last truly masculine show . " GMC VAN Section::::GMC van .
The 1983 GMC Vandura van used by the A - Team , with its characteristic red stripe , black and red turbine mag wheels , and rooftop spoiler , has become an enduring pop culture icon .
The customized 1994 Chevrolet G20 used on the A - Team movie was also on display at the 2010 New York International Auto Show .
A number of devices were seen in the back of the van in different episodes , including a mini printing press ( " Pros and Cons " ) , an audio surveillance recording device ( " A Small and Deadly War " ) , Hannibal 's disguise kits in various episodes , and a gun storage locker .
Early examples of the van had a red GMC logo on the front grille , and an additional GMC logo on the rear left door .
Early in the second season , these logos were blacked out , although GMC continued to supply vans and receive a credit on the closing credits of each episode .
The van was commonly said to be all - black , but the section above the red stripe was metallic gray .
The angle of the rear spoiler can also be seen to vary on different examples of the van within the series .
Additionally , some versions of the van have a sunroof , whereas others , typically those used for stunts ( and including the one displayed in the aforementioned Cars of the Stars Motor Museum ) do not .
This led to continuity errors in some episodes , such as in the third season 's " The Bells of St. Mary 's " , in a scene where Face ( his double ) jumps from a building onto the roof of the van with no sunroof .
Moments later , in an interior studio shot , Face climbs in through the sunroof .
Also , in many stunts where the van would surely be totaled , other makes have been used , such as a black Ford Econoline with red hubcaps painted to simulate the original red turbine mag wheels .
Many GMC / Chevrolet Vandura vans , and many of the very similar Bedford CF vans , were styled after the A - Team 's van by fans of the show .
MERCHANDISE Section::::Merchandise .
The huge success of the series saw a vast array of merchandise , including toys and snacks released both in America and internationally .

In the episode " Body Slam " , which featured Hogan , wrestling interviewer and announcer " Mean " Gene Okerlund also appeared .
In addition , the music video for John Cena 's " Bad , Bad Man " ( on Cena 's You Ca n't See Me album ) featured the Chain Gang as a three - man A - Team — Cena as Hannibal , plus Cena 's cousin Tha Trademarc as Howling Mad and Bumpy Knuckles as B.A. WEAPONS Section::::Weapons .
In early episodes the team used Colt AR-15 SP1 semi - automatic rifles ( with automatic sound effects , simulating the M16 ) , while in later seasons they used the Ruger Mini-14 , and on rare occasions , the selective fire AC-556 K variant of the Mini-14 .
Hannibal is also seen using an M60 machine gun ( which Hannibal called " Baby " ) in some episodes as well as a Micro - Uzi .
MAC-11s with parts added to simulate the Uzi appear in at least two early episodes .
Hannibal 's sidearms are either a nickel - plated Smith & Wesson Model 59 , or a stainless steel Smith & Wesson Model 639 .
Unusually in the episode " Black Day At Bad Rock " he is seen carrying a Browning Hi - Power .
Face 's usual sidearm is a Colt Lawman III , though he does use Smith & Wesson revolvers in latter seasons .
Many antagonists and members of the team are seen using 1911s as well .
Starting from Season 4 , the then - exotic Steyr AUG bullpup rifle also became prominent in the series . "
So many different firearms were used in the 1980s hit ' The A - Team ' that it 's impossible to list them all .
For five seasons , the wrongly accused foursome used rifles , handguns , submachine guns and shotguns to bring justice for the little guy while trying to stay out of jail .
And the best part had to be that regardless of the number of explosions or rounds fired , nobody ever got seriously hurt except for the occasional flesh wound of a team member .
" As a result , the American Rifleman declared The A - Team
the Number One Show on Television to regularly feature firearms .
