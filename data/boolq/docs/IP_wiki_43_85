Now stuck in her home with her father Sean and brother Alex , Quinn begins to experience increasingly disturbing paranormal phenomena , including seeing visions of a dark spirit wearing an oxygen mask known as the " Man Who Ca n't Breathe"â€”the same figure that caused her accident .
One of Quinn 's neighbors , an elderly woman with dementia who had previously said several confusing and cryptic things to her about the " Man Who Ca n't Breathe " , passes away .
Sean meets with Elise , who like him is also grieving after the death of her husband Jack , and tries to convince her to help his daughter .

However , she is convinced by her friend and former colleague Carl to continue using her spiritual ability , after he reminds her about her successful in 1986 , and stating that she is stronger than any spirits or demons because she is living and they are not .

Scott Foundas of Variety gave the film a negative review , saying " Chief among things that go bump in the night in Insidious :
Chapter 3 is the movie itself â€” a thuddingly dull prequel to James Wan 's very enjoyable ( and highly profitable ) demonic - possession horror franchise . "
Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review , saying " Insidious : Chapter 3 offers a relatable young protagonist and several key supporting players from the prior films in a nimble setup to the series . "
Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C+ , saying " Insidious Chapter 3 is the worst kind of sequel : Not terrible , but also cartoonishly unnecessary . "
Michael OrdoÃ±a of the San Francisco Chronicle rated it zero out of four stars , saying " Insidious : Chapter 3 is simply not scary .
Not a bit , not a whit .
Except that the audience will be terrified of the next stabbing of their eardrums , at generally predictable intervals . "
Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post gave the film one - and - a - half stars out of four , saying " The Insidious franchise , after three attempts to exorcise its real demons , still ca n't seem to shake what really haunts it : the ghost of B - movies past . "
Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film two - and - a - half stars out of four , saying " This prequel to the shriek hell , directed and scripted by series writer / actor Leigh Whannell , manages to avoid the Curse of the Triple Cash Grab . "
Kerry Lengel of The Arizona Republic gave the film three out of five stars , saying " Insidious : Chapter 3 is almost more a spoof of a classic like The Exorcist than it is an homage .
It 's not scary horror , it 's silly horror , and the audience is in on the joke . "
Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star - Ledger gave the film two - and - a - half stars , saying " You need more than a few sudden noises and scary shocks to make a good horror movie .
But Insidious : Chapter Three is at least an OK horror movie . "
James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film two - and - a - half out of four stars , saying " They say the third time 's the charm .
Not with the Insidious series , it is n't .
Admittedly , installment # 3 is an improvement over # 2 , but it fails to reach the highs of the chilling - but - uneven original . "
Tim Robey of The Telegraph gave the film four out of five stars , saying " It manages the all - important jump scares with the finesse of a skilled stage illusionist , but it 's the surprisingly sincere emotional core that makes it the pick of the series . "
Katie Rife of The A.V. Club gave the film a B- , saying " The motif of grief runs throughout Insidious :
Chapter 3 , which is surprisingly thematically rich for the third installment of a horror franchise .
This emotional undercurrent informs the fright scenes , which otherwise lean rather heavily on jump scares . "
Bilge Ebiri of New York magazine gave the film a negative review , saying " This is so often the problem with this genre â€” scary setups , followed by dopey resolutions â€” that you sort of want to give the movie a pass .
But given its distinguished forebears , Insidious : Chapter 3 does n't quite live up to expectations . "
SEQUEL Section::::Sequel .
In an interview
Leigh Whannell was asked " If there is a fourth Insidious film , would that be a sequel to Chapter 3 , another prequel to the original or will it continue in this timeline or go to a whole new timeline ? "
Whannell stated : " I do n't know .
I have n't really thought about it yet .
But for the purposes of this interview , I 'll say that I 'd like to explore the time between this film and the first film .
That whole area there where Elise has rediscovered her gift , I think you could have a lot of adventures before she arrives .
So I think there is a lot of room there .
We 've kind of established Lin [ Shaye ] in this particular film as kind of this superhero , so that would be kind of interesting to explore in the other films . "
