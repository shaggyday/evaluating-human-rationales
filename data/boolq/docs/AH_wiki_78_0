UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY
The United States Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) is a cabinet department of the United States federal government with responsibilities in public security , roughly comparable to the interior or home ministries of other countries .
Its stated missions involve anti - terrorism , border security , immigration and customs , cyber security , and disaster prevention and management .
It was created in response to the September 11 attacks and is the youngest U.S. cabinet department .
In fiscal year 2017 , it was allocated a net discretionary budget of $ 40.6 billion .
With more than 240,000 employees , DHS is the third largest Cabinet department , after the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs .
Homeland security policy is coordinated at the White House by the Homeland Security Council .
Other agencies with significant homeland security responsibilities include the Departments of Health and Human Services , Justice , and Energy .
The former Secretary , John F. Kelly , was replaced by Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on December 5 , 2017 .
FUNCTION Section::::Function .
Whereas the Department of Defense is charged with military actions abroad , the Department of Homeland Security works in the civilian sphere to protect the United States within , at , and outside its borders .
Its stated goal is to prepare for , prevent , and respond to domestic emergencies , particularly terrorism .
On March 1 , 2003 , DHS absorbed the Immigration and Naturalization Service ( INS ) and assumed its duties .
In doing so , it divided the enforcement and services functions into two separate and new agencies : Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services .
The investigative divisions and intelligence gathering units of the INS and Customs Service were merged forming Homeland Security Investigations .
Additionally , the border enforcement functions of the INS , including the U.S. Border Patrol , the U.S. Customs Service , and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service were consolidated into a new agency under DHS : U.S. Customs and Border Protection .
The Federal Protective Service falls under the National Protection and Programs Directorate .

In an August 5 , 2002 speech , President Bush said : " We are fighting [ ... ] to secure freedom in the homeland . "
Prior to the creation of DHS , U.S. Presidents had referred to the U.S. as " the nation " or " the republic " and to its internal policies as " domestic " .
Also unprecedented was the use , from 2002 , of the phrase " the homeland " by White House spokespeople .
NATIONAL TERRORISM ADVISORY SYSTEM Section::::National Terrorism Advisory System .
In 2011 , the Department of Homeland Security phased out the old Homeland Security Advisory System , replacing it with a two - level National Terrorism Advisory System .
The system has two types of advisories : Alerts and Bulletins .
NTAS Bulletins permit the secretary to communicate critical terrorism information that , while not necessarily indicative of a specific threat against the United States , can reach homeland security partners or the public quickly , thereby allowing recipients to implement necessary protective measures .
Alerts are issued when there is specific and credible information of a terrorist threat against the United States .
Alerts themselves have two levels : Elevated and Imminent .
An Elevated Alert is issued when there is credible information about an attack but only general information about timing or a target .
An Imminent Alert is issued when the threat is very specific and impending in the very near term .
On March 12 , 2002 , the Homeland Security Advisory System , a color - coded terrorism risk advisory scale , was created as the result of a Presidential Directive to provide a " comprehensive and effective means to disseminate information regarding the risk of terrorist acts to Federal , State , and local authorities and to the American people . "
Many procedures at government facilities are tied into the alert level ; for example a facility may search all entering vehicles when the alert is above a certain level .
Since January 2003 , it has been administered in coordination with DHS ; it has also been the target of frequent jokes and ridicule on the part of the administration 's detractors about its ineffectiveness .
After resigning , Tom Ridge stated that he did not always agree with the threat level adjustments pushed by other government agencies .
In January 2003 , the office was merged into the Department of Homeland Security and the White House Homeland Security Council , both of which were created by the Homeland Security Act of 2002 .
The Homeland Security Council , similar in nature to the National Security Council , retains a policy coordination and advisory role and is led by the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security .
As of January 13 , 2011 , the DHS advised the American public of an ' elevated national threat ' level , recommending that all Americans ' should establish an emergency preparedness kit and emergency plan for themselves and their family , and stay informed about what to do during an emergency ' .
HISTORY CREATION Section::::History .
Section::::Creation .
In response to the September 11 attacks , President George W. Bush announced the establishment of the Office of Homeland Security ( OHS ) to coordinate " homeland security " efforts .
The office was headed by former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge , who assumed the title of Assistant to the President for Homeland Security .
The official announcement stated : Ridge began his duties as OHS director on October 8 , 2001 .
According to Peter Andreas , a border theorist , the creation of DHS constituted the most significant government reorganization since the Cold War , and the most substantial reorganization of federal agencies since the National Security Act of 1947 , which placed the different military departments under a secretary of defense and created the National Security Council and Central Intelligence Agency .
DHS also constitutes the most diverse merger of federal functions and responsibilities , incorporating 22 government agencies into a single organization .
The Department of Homeland Security was established on November 25 , 2002 , by the Homeland Security Act of 2002 .
It was intended to consolidate U.S. executive branch organizations related to " homeland security " into a single Cabinet agency .
The following 22 agencies were incorporated into the new department : !
Original agency ! !
Original department ! !
New agency or office after transfer Prior to the signing of the bill , controversy about its adoption centered on whether the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency should be incorporated in part or in whole ( neither were included ) .
The bill was also controversial for the presence of unrelated " riders " , as well as for eliminating certain union - friendly civil service and labor protections for department employees .
Without these protections , employees could be expeditiously reassigned or dismissed on grounds of security , incompetence or insubordination , and DHS would not be required to notify their union representatives .
The plan stripped 180,000 government employees of their union rights .
In 2002 , Bush officials argued that the September 11 attacks made the proposed elimination of employee protections imperative .
Congress ultimately passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002 without the union - friendly measures , and President Bush signed the bill into law on November 25 , 2002 .
It was the largest U.S. government reorganization in the 50 years since the United States Department of Defense was created .
Tom Ridge was named secretary on January 24 , 2003 , and began naming his chief deputies .
DHS officially began operations on January 24 , 2003 , but most of the department 's component agencies were not transferred into the new Department until March 1 .
After establishing the basic structure of DHS and working to integrate its components and get the department functioning , Ridge announced his resignation on November 30 , 2004 , following the re - election of President Bush .
Bush initially nominated former New York City Police Department commissioner Bernard Kerik as his successor , but on December 10 , Kerik withdrew his nomination , citing personal reasons and saying it " would not be in the best interests " of the country for him to pursue the post .
CHANGES
UNDER MICHAEL CHERTOFF Section::::Changes under Michael Chertoff .
On January 11 , 2005 , President Bush nominated federal judge Michael Chertoff to succeed Ridge .
Chertoff was confirmed on February 15 , 2005 , by a vote of 98‚Äì0 in the U.S. Senate .
He was sworn in the same day .
In February 2005 , DHS and the Office of Personnel Management issued rules relating to employee pay and discipline for a new personnel system named MaxHR .
The Washington Post said that the rules would allow DHS " to override any provision in a union contract by issuing a department - wide directive " and would make it " difficult , if not impossible , for unions to negotiate over arrangements for staffing , deployments , technology and other workplace matters . "
In August 2005 , U.S. District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer blocked the plan on the grounds that it did not ensure collective - bargaining rights for DHS employees .
A federal appeals court ruled against DHS in 2006 ; pending a final resolution to the litigation , Congress 's fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for DHS provided no funding for the proposed new personnel system .
DHS announced in early 2007 that it was retooling its pay and performance system and retiring the name " MaxHR " .
In a February 2008 court filing , DHS said that it would no longer pursue the new rules , and that it would abide by the existing civil service labor - management procedures .
A federal court issued an order closing the case .
CHANGES
UNDER KIRSTJEN NIELSEN
Section::::Changes under Kirstjen Nielsen .
On November 16 , 2018 , President Trump signed into law the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2018 , which elevated the mission of the former - DHS National Protection and Programs Directorate ( NPPD ) within DHS and established the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency ( CISA ) .
SEAL Section::::Seal .
A DHS press release dated June 6 , 2003 explains the seal as follows : The seal was developed with input from senior DHS leadership , employees , and the U.S. Commission on Fine Arts .
The Ad Council ‚Äì which partners with DHS on its Ready.gov campaign ‚Äì and the consulting company Landor Associates were responsible for graphic design and maintaining heraldic integrity .
HEADQUARTERS Section::::Headquarters .
Since its inception , the department has had its temporary headquarters in Washington , D.C. 's Nebraska Avenue Complex , a former naval facility .
The site , across from American University , has 32 buildings comprising of administrative space .
In early 2007 , the department submitted a $ 4.1 billion plan to Congress to consolidate its 60-plus Washington - area offices into a single headquarters complex at the St. Elizabeths Hospital campus in Anacostia , Southeast Washington ,
D.C. The earliest DHS would begin moving to St. Elizabeths is 2012 .
The move is being championed by District of Columbia officials because of the positive economic impact it will have on historically depressed Anacostia .
The move has been criticized by historic preservationists , who claim the revitalization plans will destroy dozens of historic buildings on the campus .
Community activists have criticized the plans because the facility will remain walled off and have little interaction with the surrounding area .
On January 8 , 2009 , the National Capital Planning Commission approved the Department of Homeland Security 's plans to move into the campus of St. Elizabeths Hospital .
In February 2015 the General Services Administration said that the site would open in 2021 .
DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGETING EFFECTS
Section::::Disaster preparedness and response .
Section::::Congressional budgeting effects .
During a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on the reauthorization of DHS , Elaine Duke , deputy secretary of DHS , said there is a weariness and anxiety within DHS about the repeated congressional efforts to agree to a long - term spending plan , which has resulted in several threats to shutdown the federal government .
" Shutdowns are disruptive , " Duke said .
She said the " repeated failure on a longtime spending plan resulting in short - term continuing resolutions ( CRs ) has caused " angst " among the department 's 240,000 employees in the weeks leading up to the CRs .
" The uncertainty about funding hampers DHS 's ability to pursue major projects and it takes away attention and manpower from important priorities .
Seventy percent of DHS employees are considered essential and are not furloughed during government shutdowns .
READY.GOV
Section::::Ready.gov .
Soon after the formation of Department of Homeland Security , the department worked with the Ad Council to launch the Ready Campaign , a national public service advertising ( PSA ) campaign to educate and empower Americans to prepare for and respond to emergencies including natural and man - made disasters .
With pro bono creative support from the Martin Agency of Richmond , Virginia , the campaign website " Ready.gov " and materials were conceived in March 2002 and launched in February 2003 , just before the launch of the Iraq War .
One of the first announcements that garnered widespread public attention to this campaign was one by Tom Ridge in which he stated that in the case of a chemical attack , citizens should use duct tape and plastic sheeting to build a homemade bunker , or " sheltering in place " to protect themselves .
As a result , the sales of duct tape skyrocketed and DHS was criticized for being too alarmist .
On March 1 , 2003 , the Federal Emergency Management Agency was absorbed into the DHS , and in fall of 2008 , took over coordination of the campaign .
The Ready Campaign and its Spanish language version Listo.gov asks individuals to do three things : build an emergency supply kit , make a family emergency plan and be informed about the different types of emergencies that can occur and how to respond .
The campaign messages have been promoted through television , radio , print , outdoor and web PSAs , as well as brochures , toll - free phone lines and the English and Spanish language websites Ready.gov and Listo.gov .
The general campaign aims to reach all Americans , but targeted resources are also available via " Ready Business " for small- to medium - sized business and " Ready Kids " for parents and teachers of children ages 8‚Äì12 .
In 2015 , the campaign also launched a series of PSAs to help the whole community , people with disabilities and others with access and functional needs prepare for emergencies , which included open captioning , a certified deaf interpreter and audio descriptions for viewers who are blind or have low vision .
NATIONAL INCIDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM Section::::National Incident Management System .
On March 1 , 2004 , the National Incident Management System ( NIMS ) was created .
The stated purpose was to provide a consistent incident management approach for federal , state , local , and tribal governments .
Under Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5 , all federal departments were required to adopt the NIMS and to use it in their individual domestic incident management and emergency prevention , preparedness , response , recovery , and mitigation program and activities .
NATIONAL RESPONSE
FRAMEWORK Section::::National Response Framework .
In December 2004 , the National Response Plan ( NRP ) was created , in an attempt to align federal coordination structures , capabilities , and resources into a unified , all - discipline , and all - hazards approach to domestic incident management .
The NRP was built on the template of the NIMS .
On January 22 , 2008 , the National Response Framework was published in the Federal Register as an updated replacement of the NRP , effective March 22 , 2008 .
SURGE CAPACITY FORCE Section::::Surge Capacity Force .
The Post - Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act directs the DHS Secretary to designate employees from throughout the department to staff a Surge Capacity Force ( SCF ) .
During a declared disaster , the DHS Secretary will determine if SCF support is necessary .
The secretary will then authorize FEMA to task and deploy designated personnel from DHS components and other Federal Executive Agencies to respond to extraordinary disasters .
CYBER - SECURITY Section::::Cyber - security .
The DHS National Cyber Security Division ( NCSD ) is responsible for the response system , risk management program , and requirements for cyber - security in the U.S.
The division is home to US - CERT operations and the National Cyber Alert System .
The DHS Science and Technology Directorate helps government and private end - users transition to new cyber - security capabilities .
This directorate also funds the Cyber Security Research and Development Center , which identifies and prioritizes research and development for NCSD .
The center works on the Internet 's routing infrastructure ( the SPRI program ) and Domain Name System ( DNSSEC ) , identity theft and other online criminal activity ( ITTC ) , Internet traffic and networks research ( PREDICT datasets and the DETER testbed ) , Department of Defense and HSARPA exercises ( Livewire and Determined Promise ) , and wireless security in cooperation with Canada .
On October 30 , 2009 , DHS opened the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center .
The center brings together government organizations responsible for protecting computer networks and networked infrastructure .
In January 2017 , DHS officially designated state - run election systems as critical infrastructure .
The designation made it easier for state and local election officials to get cybersecurity help from the federal government .
In October 2017 , DHS convened a Government Coordinating Council ( GCC ) for the Election Infrastructure Subsection with representatives from various state and federal agencies such as the Election Assistance Commission and National Association of Secretaries of State .
EXPENDITURES Section::::Expenditures .
In the United States Federal Budget for 2010 , entitled ' A New Era of Responsibility ' , the DHS was allocated a discretionary budget of $ 42.7 billion ( financial year 2009 : $ 40.1 billion ) .
The end - of - year DHS Annual Financial Report for financial year 2010 showed a net cost of operations of $ 56.4 billion ( FY 2009 , restated : $ 49.9 billion ) , out of total budgetary resources of $ 83.2 billion ( FY 2009 , restated : $ 85.2 billion ) .
The components with the highest net cost were US Coast Guard ( $ 12.1 billion ) , U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( $ 11.6 billion ) , and Federal Emergency Management Agency ( $ 10.5 billion ) .
Revenues of $ 10.4 billion were generated in the year ( FY 2009 , restated : $ 9.8 billion ) .
According to the Washington Post , " DHS has given $ 31 billion in grants since 2003 to state and local governments for homeland security and to improve their ability to find and protect against terrorists , including $ 3.8 billion in 2010 . "
AUDIT OF EXPENDITURES Section::::Audit of expenditures .
The DHS independent auditor is KPMG , one of the Big Four audit firms .
Due to the level of material weaknesses identified , KPMG was unable to audit the DHS financial statements for FY 2010 .
KPMG was unable to express an audit opinion on the FY 2009 , FY 2008 , FY 2007 , FY 2005 , and FY 2003 financial statements .
Attempts to access the reports for FY 2006 and FY 2004 within the ' information for citizens ' portal met with a 404 error .
The message from the DHS chief financial officer in the FY 2010 report states " This Annual Financial Report ( AFR ) is our principal financial statement of accountability to the President , Congress and the American public .
The AFR gives a comprehensive view of the Department 's financial activities and demonstrates the Department 's stewardship of taxpayer dollars .
" The message from the DHS chief financial officer concludes " I am extremely proud of the Department 's accomplishments ... we will continue to build upon our successes .
" The Secretary of Homeland Security endorsed this message , saying that the DHS is " continuing to be responsible stewards of taxpayer resources .
The scope of our mission is broad , challenging , and vital to the security of the Nation ...
Thank you for your partnership and collaboration .
Yours very truly , Janet Napolitano . " CRITICISM Section::::Criticism .
The Department of Homeland Security has received substantial criticism over excessive bureaucracy , waste , fraud , ineffectiveness and lack of transparency .
Its information sharing centers have been accused of violating American civil liberties and targeting American citizens as potential threats to national security .
EXCESS , WASTE , AND INEFFECTIVENESS Section::::Excess , waste , and ineffectiveness .
The Department of Homeland Security has been dogged by persistent criticism over excessive bureaucracy , waste , ineffectiveness and lack of transparency .
Congress estimates that the department has wasted roughly $ 15 billion in failed contracts ( ) .
In 2003 , the department came under fire after the media revealed that Laura Callahan , Deputy Chief Information Officer at DHS with responsibilities for sensitive national security databases , had obtained her bachelor , masters , and doctorate computer science degrees through Hamilton University , a diploma mill in a small town in Wyoming .
The department was blamed for up to $ 2 billion of waste and fraud after audits by the Government Accountability Office revealed widespread misuse of government credit cards by DHS employees , with purchases including beer brewing kits , $ 70,000 of plastic dog booties that were later deemed unusable , boats purchased at double the retail price ( many of which later could not be found ) , and iPods ostensibly for use in " data storage " .
A 2015 inspection of IT infrastructure found that the department was running over a hundred computer systems whose owners were unknown , including Secret and Top Secret databases , many with out of date security or weak passwords .
Basic security reviews were absent , and the department had apparently made deliberate attempts to delay publication of information about the flaws .
DATA MINING ( ADVISE )
Section::::Data mining ( ADVISE ) .
The Associated Press reported on September 5 , 2007 , that DHS had scrapped an anti - terrorism data mining tool called ADVISE ( Analysis , Dissemination , Visualization , Insight and Semantic Enhancement ) after the agency 's internal Inspector General found that pilot testing of the system had been performed using data on real people without required privacy safeguards in place .
The system , in development at Lawrence Livermore and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory since 2003 , has cost the agency $ 42 million to date .
Controversy over the program is not new ; in March 2007 , the Government Accountability Office stated that " the ADVISE tool could misidentify or erroneously associate an individual with undesirable activity such as fraud , crime or terrorism . "
Homeland Security 's Inspector General later said that ADVISE was poorly planned , time - consuming for analysts to use , and lacked adequate justifications .
FUSION CENTERS Section::::Fusion centers .
Fusion centers are terrorism prevention and response centers , many of which were created under a joint project between the Department of Homeland Security and the US Department of Justice 's Office of Justice Programs between 2003 and 2007 .
The fusion centers gather information not only from government sources , but also from their partners in the private sector .
They are designed to promote information sharing at the federal level between agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , Department of Justice , US Military and state and local level government .
, the Department of Homeland Security recognized at least seventy - two fusion centers .
Fusion centers may also be affiliated with an Emergency Operations Center that responds in the event of a disaster .
There are a number of documented criticisms of fusion centers , including relative ineffectiveness at counterterrorism activities , the potential to be used for secondary purposes unrelated to counterterrorism , and their links to violations of civil liberties of American citizens and others .
David Rittgers of the Cato Institute has noted : a long line of fusion center and DHS reports labeling broad swaths of the public as a threat to national security .
The North Texas Fusion System labeled Muslim lobbyists as a potential threat ; a DHS analyst in Wisconsin thought both pro- and anti - abortion activists were worrisome ; a Pennsylvania homeland security contractor watched environmental activists , Tea Party groups , and a Second Amendment rally ; the Maryland State Police put anti - death penalty and anti - war activists in a federal terrorism database ; a fusion center in Missouri thought that all third - party voters and Ron Paul supporters were a threat ...
MIAC REPORT
Section::::MIAC report .
The Missouri Information Analysis Center ( MIAC ) made news in 2009 for targeting supporters of third party candidates ( such as Ron Paul ) , pro - life activists , and conspiracy theorists as potential militia members .
Anti - war activists and Islamic lobby groups were targeted in Texas , drawing criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union .
According to the Department of Homeland Security : The Privacy Office has identified a number of risks to privacy presented by the fusion center program : * Justification for fusion centers * * Ambiguous Lines of Authority , Rules , and Oversight * * Participation of the Military and the Private Sector * *
Data Mining * * Excessive Secrecy *
* Inaccurate or Incomplete Information * * Mission Creep * 2009 VIRGINIA TERRORISM THREAT ASSESSMENT Section::::2009
Virginia terrorism threat assessment .
In 2009 , the Virginia Fusion Center came under criticism for publishing a terrorism threat assessment which stated that certain universities are potential hubs for terror related activity .
The report targeted historically black colleges and identified hacktivism as a form of terrorism .
MAIL INTERCEPTION Section::::Mail interception .
In 2006 , MSNBC reported that Grant Goodman , " an 81-year - old retired University of Kansas history professor , received a letter from his friend in the Philippines that had been opened and resealed with a strip of dark green tape bearing the words " by Border Protection " and carrying the official Homeland Security seal .
" The letter was sent by a devout Catholic Filipino woman with no history of supporting Islamic terrorism .
A spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection " acknowledged that the agency can , will and does open mail coming to U.S. citizens that originates from a foreign country whenever it 's deemed necessary " : " All mail originating outside the United States Customs territory that is to be delivered inside the U.S. Customs territory is subject to Customs examination , " says the CBP Web site .
That includes personal correspondence .
" All mail means ' all mail , ' " said John Mohan , a CBP spokesman , emphasizing the point .
The department declined to outline what criteria are used to determine when a piece of personal correspondence should be opened or to say how often or in what volume Customs might be opening mail .
Goodman 's story provoked outrage in the blogosphere , as well as in the more established media .
Reacting to the incident , Mother Jones remarked that " [ u]nlike other prying government agencies , Homeland Security wants you to know it is watching you .
" CNN observed that " [ o]n the heels of the NSA wiretapping controversy , Goodman 's letter raises more concern over the balance between privacy and security . " EMPLOYEE MORALE Section::::Employee morale .
In July 2006 , the Office of Personnel Management conducted a survey of federal employees in all 36 federal agencies on job satisfaction and how they felt their respective agency was headed .
DHS was last or near to last in every category including ; * 33rd on the talent management index
* 35th on the leadership and knowledge management index * 36th on the job satisfaction index * 36th on the results - oriented performance culture index
The low scores were attributed to major concerns about basic supervision , management and leadership within the agency .
Examples from the survey reveal most concerns are about promotion and pay increase based on merit , dealing with poor performance , rewarding creativity and innovation , leadership generating high levels of motivation in the workforce , recognition for doing a good job , lack of satisfaction with various component policies and procedures and lack of information about what is going on with the organization .
DHS is the only large federal agency to score below 50 % in overall survey rankings .
It was last of large federal agencies in 2014 with 44.0 % and fell even lower in 2015 at 43.1 % , again last place .
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT PROCESSING PERFORMANCE
Section::::Freedom of Information Act processing performance .
In the Center for Effective Government analysis of 15 federal agencies which receive the most Freedom of Information Act FOIA requests , published in 2015 ( using 2012 and 2013 data ) , the Department of Homeland Security earned a D by scoring 69 out of a possible 100 points , i.e. did not earn a satisfactory overall grade .
It also had not updated its FOIA policies since the 2007 FOIA amendments .
FOURTEEN WORDS SLOGAN AND
" 88 " REFERENCE Section::::Fourteen Words slogan and " 88 " reference .
In 2018 , the DHS was accused of referencing the white supremacist
Fourteen Words slogan in an official document , by using a similar fourteen - worded title , in relation to illegal immigration and border control :
We Must Secure The Border And Build The Wall To Make America Safe Again .
Although dismissed by the DHS as a coincidence , both the use of " 88 " in a document , and the similarity to the slogan 's phrasing ( " We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children " ) , drew criticism and controversy from several media outlets .
