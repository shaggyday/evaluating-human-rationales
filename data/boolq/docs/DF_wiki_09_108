ISLE OF MAN POST OFFICE
The Isle of Man Post Office ( ) , which formerly used the trading name Isle of Man Post , operates postal collection , ancillary mail services , philatelic goods and delivery services and post office counter services on the Isle of Man .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The Isle of Man 's postal service was originally operated by the United Kingdom 's General Post Office , with a daily postal connection with the UK since 1879 .
In 1966 the UK Government commenced planning to convert the General Post Office into a public corporation , and as part of this process offered each of the Crown Dependencies the opportunity to assume control of the operations of the GPO on their territories .
On 18 October 1968 , Tynwald decided that they did not wish to take up the offer , but provision was made in the Post Office Act 1969 nonetheless .
In the Channel Islands , the authorities did accept the offer , and postal activities of the GPO were transferred in October 1969 to form Jersey Post and Guernsey Post .
The GPO had not provided any telecommunications services in the Channel Islands since the 1920s .
In 1972 , following negotiations by Tynwald with the GPO to leave the Island 's telephone system , it was agreed that the Isle of Man would , after all , take over control of the insular postal administration .
As a result , the Isle of Man Post Office Authority was formed and took over the postal assets and functions of the Post Office on 5 July 1973 .
The monies paid for the assets of the Post Office , £ 148,624 , were recouped within the first year from the surpluses generated by the Authority .
It was reconstituted as a Statutory Board and renamed the ' Isle of Man Post Office ' under the Post Office Act 1993 .
TELECOMMUNICATIONS Section::::Telecommunications .
Telecommunications remained the responsibility of the British Post Office until 1981 , when British Telecom was created .
In 1987 , telecommunications were transferred to the local company Manx Telecom , which was initially a wholly owned subsidiary of BT , but became a subsidiary of O2 .
STAMPS Section::::Stamps .
Stamps marked with the name of the Isle of Man were first issued in 1971 ; the first issue was a variant of the ' Machin ' design .
Since 1973 only Manx stamps have been valid on the island , and Manx stamps are not valid for postage in the UK or elsewhere .
Isle of Man stamps have since become popular with philatelists .
POSTAL RATES Section::::Postal rates .
When sending mail to the Island from elsewhere , the Isle of Man is treated as though it were part of the United Kingdom , and mail from the UK continues to be charged at Royal Mail 's UK inland rates .
However , postcodes were not introduced in the Isle of Man until 1993 , when the Island was postcoded as the IM postcode area as an extension of the United Kingdom postcode system .
Mail sent from the Island to the UK is flown across the Irish Sea , and enters the first - class stream of the Royal Mail for next - day delivery .
The Isle of Man Post Office is a member of the Small European Postal Administration Cooperation .
