WARNING ( TRAFFIC STOP )
When a traffic stop is made , a warning issued by the officer is a statement that the motorist has committed some offense , but is being spared the actual citation .
Officers use their own discretion whether to issue a citation or warning .
The motorist may receive the warning either verbally or written , but will not be charged with the offense , will not have to pay a fine , and will not receive any points .
Depending on the laws of the jurisdiction , the warning may or may not appear on records visible to officers , which , if it does , could result in another stop within a fixed period of time leading to an actual citation , or in some cases , the motorist may be charged with both offenses .
Officers see advantages of giving warnings as having less paperwork , enabling officers to use their time more efficiently , and reducing the likelihood that the officer will have to appear in court .
CRITICISM OF WARNINGS Section::::Criticism of warnings .
One criticism of warnings is the possibility that officers may offer them to some motorists and not to others based on favoritism , singling them out over factors such as their race , attractive appearance , the vehicle they are driving , the way they are dressed , or their social class .
Warnings can be difficult to challenge , which could be a violation of due process of law .
They adversely affect a driver 's CSA score , and can not be reversed like a successfully challenged citation .
