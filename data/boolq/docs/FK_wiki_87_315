SUPER BOWL CURSE The Super Bowl curse or Super Bowl hangover is a phrase that refers to one of three phenomena that may occur in the National Football League ( NFL ) .
First , that host teams rarely qualify for the Super Bowl during the year their city will host .
Second , that teams rarely win consecutive Super Bowls .
Third , that a participating team will follow their Super Bowl appearance with sub - par seasons .
These interpretations of the Super Bowl curse are not mutually exclusive .
The term has been used since at least 1992 , when The Washington Post used the term in print .
Former NFL General Manager Charley Casserly attributed the curse to such factors as " a shorter offseason , contract problems , [ and ] more demand for your players ' time " .
Casserly also noted that " once the season starts , you become the biggest game on everybody 's schedule , " suggesting that pressure from fans and spectators may also affect a team 's performance .
THE HOME FIELD ADVANTAGE CURSE Section::::The Home Field Advantage Curse .
The home field curse affects the host team of the Super Bowl .
So far no team has yet managed to reach the Super Bowl in their home stadium .
Five teams with Super Bowls in their home venue have qualified for the divisional playoffs : the 1994 Miami Dolphins , the 1998 Miami Dolphins , the 2016 Houston Texans , and the 2017 Minnesota Vikings , the Vikings being the first to qualify for their conference 's title game .
From 1966–2011 ( excluding the six Super Bowl games held in a stadium without a professional team ) , the Super Bowl host team has had 11 winning seasons , four split seasons , and 25 losing seasons .
Mathematically , the probability of that many losing seasons or more occurring by chance ( assuming a 50 percent chance of having a losing season ( disregarding .500 seasons ) ) is 7.69 percent .
It should be noted , however , that the Super Bowl host stadium is selected several years before the game is played , without regard to the teams that qualify .
Only two NFL teams have reached the Super Bowl hosted in their home region : the San Francisco 49ers , who played Super Bowl XIX in Stanford Stadium , rather than Candlestick Park , and the Los Angeles Rams , who played Super Bowl XIV in the Rose Bowl , rather than the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum .
Besides Stanford Stadium and the Rose Bowl , the only other Super Bowl venue that was not the home stadium to an NFL team at the time was Rice Stadium in Houston : the Houston Oilers had played there previously , but moved to the Astrodome several years prior to Super Bowl VIII .
The Miami Orange Bowl was the only AFL stadium to host a Super Bowl and the only stadium to host consecutive Super Bowls , hosting Super Bowl II and III .
MetLife Stadium in New Jersey , which hosted Super Bowl XLVIII , is the home stadium of two NFL teams : the New York Giants and the New York Jets .
This list of examples is not exhaustive ; no team has ever qualified for the Super Bowl played in their home stadium . !

THE NON - REPEAT CURSE Section::::The Non - Repeat Curse .
Since 1993 , few winning teams have followed up their Super Bowl appearances with a second Super Bowl appearance , or even advanced to a conference title game in the subsequent season ( the 1994 Dallas Cowboys qualified for their conference title but did not qualify for the Super Bowl ) .
Only seven teams have won back - to - back Super Bowl championships , and only one of these seven have made more than two consecutive winning appearances in the Super Bowl .
The only franchise to reach more than three straight title games was the Buffalo Bills who lost four Super Bowls in a row from 1990–93 .
Since 2005 , no incumbent holder has managed to successfully defend their title .
Between 2006 and 2013 , every defending Super Bowl champion would conclude the following season either losing their opening playoff game or failing to qualify for the playoffs .
This list of examples includes every team that has ever had back - to - back appearances at the Super Bowl . !

THE LOSERS ' CURSE Section::::The Losers ' Curse .
Although many teams experience this phenomenon , it is certainly not the rule .
There are many speculations made about potential causal factors for this trend , including the team having a shorter offseason due to their extended postseason play , difficulty settling contracts , more pressure on the players , and an increase in visibility , which could contribute to nervous playing .
One piece of the Super Bowl curse asserts the team that loses the Super Bowl will go into losing seasons overall .
The trend was especially evident during the early 2000s .
