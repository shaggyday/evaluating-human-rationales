SECOND WORLD
The Second World is a term that was used during the Cold War to refer to the industrial socialist states that were under the influence of the Soviet Union .
In the first two decades following World War II , 19 communist states emerged ; all of these were at least originally within the Soviet orbit , though some ( notably , Yugoslavia and the Peoples Republic of China ) broke with Moscow and developed their own foreign policy , while retaining Communist governments .
But most communist states remained part of this bloc until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 ; afterwards , only five Communist states remained : China , North Korea , Cuba , Laos , and Vietnam .
Along with " First World " and " Third World " , the term was used to divide the states of Earth into three broad categories .
The concept of " Second World " was a construct of the Cold War and the term is still largely used to describe former communist countries that are between poverty and prosperity , many of which are now capitalist states .
Subsequently the actual meaning of the terms " First World " , " Second World " and " Third World " changed from being based on political ideology to an economic definition .
The three - world theory has been criticized as crude and relatively outdated for its nominal ordering ( 1 ; 2 ; 3 ) and sociologists have instead used the words " developed " , " developing " , and " underdeveloped " as replacement terms for global stratification ( which in turn have been criticized as displaying a colonialist mindset ) â€” nevertheless , the three - world theory is still popular in contemporary literature and media .
This might also cause semantic variation of the term between describing a region 's political entities and its people .
