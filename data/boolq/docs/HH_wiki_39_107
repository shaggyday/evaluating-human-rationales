LIST OF EQUINE FATALITIES IN THE GRAND NATIONAL Modern steeplechase races have an average of just over 4 equine fatalities for every 1,000 horses taking part , according to the British Horseracing Authority .
However , the Grand National , a popular steeplechase held annually in England , yielded 7 fatalities out of 439 horses taking part between 2000 and 2010 .
The Grand National is a National Hunt handicap race over a distance of 4 miles 3Â½ furlongs and over 30 fences at Aintree Racecourse near Liverpool .
The high number of equine deaths in the race has made it a target for animal rights activists .
While course officials have repeatedly taken safety measures over the years , such as improving veterinary facilities and reducing the severity of fences , some have campaigned for further modifications or the abolition of the event that was inaugurated in 1839 .
After the 1989 Grand National , in which two horses died in incidents at Becher 's Brook ( the sixth and 22nd fence on the course ) , Aintree began making significant changes to the fences that are jumped during the National .
The brook on the landing - side of Becher 's was filled in to prevent horses rolling back into it , and the incline on the landing - side has been mostly levelled out , whilst retaining a drop to slow the runners .
Other fences have been reduced in height , toe - boards have been made taller , and the entry requirements for participating horses have been made stricter , such as the requirement for runners to have been placed fourth or better in a previous recognised steeplechase over a distance of at least three miles .
Some within the horseracing community , including some with notable achievements in the Grand National , such as Ginger McCain and Bob Champion , have argued that the lowering of fences and the narrowing of ditches , primarily designed to increase horse safety , has had the adverse effect by encouraging the runners to race faster .
During the 1970s and 1980s
the Grand National saw a total of 12 horses die ( half of which were at Becher 's Brook ) ; in the next 20-year period from 1990 to 2010 , when modifications to the course were most significant , there were 17 equine fatalities .
LIST OF FATALITIES Section::::List of fatalities .
The animal welfare charity League Against Cruel Sports counts the number of horse deaths at 40 over the three - day meet from the year 2000 to 2013 .
The following list details the equine fatalities during , or as a direct result of participating in , the Grand National , that is , the showpiece steeplechase itself rather than all the various races held over the entire three - day " Grand National meeting " ( which includes two other races over one circuit of the National course : the Fox Hunters for amateur jockeys and the Topham for professional jockeys ) .
It includes , where applicable and where known , the fence at which the fatality occurred . !
