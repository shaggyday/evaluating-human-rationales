VISA POLICY OF IRELAND
The visa policy of Ireland is set by the Government of Ireland and determines visa requirements for foreign citizens .
If someone other than a European Union , European Economic Area , or Swiss citizen seeks entry to Ireland , they must be a national of a visa - exempt country or have a valid Irish visa issued by one of the Irish diplomatic missions around the world .
Although Ireland is a member of the European Union , it has an opt - out from the Schengen Area and is therefore able to set its own visa policy .
Ireland also operates the Common Travel Area with the United Kingdom , the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man which allows for open internal borders between the countries and territories .
Established in 1923 , it permits British and Irish citizens to freely move around the Common Travel Area with minimal identity documents .
Visa policy of Ireland is similar to the visa policy of the Schengen Area .
It grants visa - free entry to all Schengen Annex II nationalities , except for Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Colombia , Georgia , Macedonia , Marshall Islands , Mauritius , Micronesia , Moldova , Montenegro , Palau , Peru , Serbia , Timor - Leste , Ukraine and Venezuela .
Ireland also grants visa - free entry to several additional countries â€“ Belize , Bolivia , Botswana , Eswatini , Fiji , Guyana , Lesotho , Maldives , Nauru and South Africa .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Ireland 's visa policy has been amended since its inception through primary legislation and statutory instruments .
The Aliens Act of 1935 confers the power of deportation and the power of immigration control to the Minister for Justice of the Irish Free State .
On 12 April 1935 , the Irish Free State exempted citizens of the United Kingdom , the Dominion of Canada , Commonwealth of Australia , Dominion of New Zealand , Union of South Africa , Dominion of Newfoundland and British India from the Aliens Act and therefore did not recognise those citizens as aliens .
The 1946 Aliens Order requires all aliens to present a passport to an immigration control officer for inspection within 24 hours if not arriving from Great Britain or Northern Ireland .
The maximum stay for aliens was one month .
During the 1940s and 1950s , Ireland had concluded bilateral visa exemption agreements with countries of Western Europe .
In 1962 , Ireland changed the definition of alien and now included those countries named above , with the exception of those born in Great Britain or Northern Ireland .
The 1962 Aliens Amendment Order exempted citizens of Austria , Belgium , Denmark , Finland , France , West Germany , Greece , Iceland , Italy , Liechtenstein , Luxembourg , Monaco , the Netherlands , Norway , Spain , Sweden , Switzerland , Portugal , Tunisia , Turkey and the United States from visas for three months .
It also gave special provisions to citizens of the British Commonwealth , whereby they are exempted by the Aliens Order of 1946 , although they may be refused leave to land unless they comply with certain conditions .
A 1966 amendment gives rights of admission to those states of the British Commonwealth , which is later revoked in 1972 .
In 1972 , aliens were required to seek work permits from the Minister for Labour to work in the state .
In 1975 , Ireland published its first list of visa - exempt nationalities and also removed the special provisions from Commonwealth citizens under Irish law .
1999 was the first development of a comprehensive list of countries which required visas .
On 29 March 1988 , the first Irish transit visa requirement was announced for Iran .

The scheme is not applicable to those who are " Visitors in Transit " and " Visitors seeking to enter for the purpose of marriage or to enter a civil partnership " .
The visa waiver is only for those who have cleared immigration in the United Kingdom and have been granted for leave for up to 180 days in the UK .
Participants can enter Ireland visa - free for up to 90 days or until the current permission to remain in the UK , whichever is shorter .
They may enter Ireland from a country other than the UK as long as both their visa and their permission to remain in the UK have not expired .
The scheme also applies to citizens from Kuwait , Oman , and Qatar who have entered the UK with an Electronic Visa Waiver as long as those citizens have arrived in Ireland directly from the UK .
The scheme was initially set to run until 31 October 2012 but was extended for four years until 31 October 2016 .

Switzerland , which is a member of EFTA but not of the EEA , is not bound by the Directive but rather has a separate bilateral agreement on the free movement with the EU .
Citizens of all European Economic Area ( EEA ) member states and Switzerland holding a valid passport or national identity card enjoy freedom of movement rights in each other 's territory and can enter and reside in the each other 's territory without a visa .
If EU , EEA and Swiss nationals are unable to present a valid passport or national identity card at the border , they must nonetheless be afforded every reasonable opportunity to obtain the necessary documents or have them brought to them within a reasonable period of time or corroborate or prove by other means that he / she is covered by the right of free movement .
However , EU , EEA member states and Switzerland can refuse entry to an EU / EEA / Swiss national on public policy , public security or public health grounds where the person presents a " genuine , present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society " .
If the person has obtained permanent residence in the country where he / she seeks entry ( a status which is normally attained after 5 years of residence ) , the member state can only expel him / her on serious grounds of public policy or public security .
Where the person has resided for 10 years or is a minor , the member state can only expel him / her on imperative grounds of public security ( and , in the case of minors , if expulsion is necessary in the best interests of the child , as provided for in the Convention on the Rights of the Child ) .
Expulsion on public health grounds must relate to diseases with ' epidemic potential ' which have occurred less than 3 months from the person 's the date of arrival in the Member State where he /
