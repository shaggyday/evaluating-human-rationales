MERCEDES - BENZ A - CLASS
The Mercedes - Benz A - Class is a subcompact executive car ( subcompact in its first two generations ) produced by the German automobile manufacturer Mercedes - Benz .
The first generation ( W168 ) was introduced in 1997 , the second generation model ( W169 ) appeared in late 2004 and the third generation model ( W176 ) was launched in 2012 .
The fourth generation model ( W177 ) which was launched in 2018 will mark the first time the A - Class is offered in the United States and Canada .
This fourth generation A - Class will also be the first to be offered both as a hatchback ( W177 ) and sedan ( V177 ) .
Originally produced only as a five - door hatchback in 1997 , the second generation W169 introduced a three - door hatchback .
In the markets where the A - Class is or has been sold , it has represented the entry level model for Mercedes - Benz .
Having grown by since the original model , the 2012 third generation A - class was longer than the first - generation B - class .
And although sometimes referred to by fans as the ' Baby Benz ' , Mercedes themselves actually use that moniker for the 1982 Mercedes 190 ( W201 ) , their first compact executive car model .
FIRST GENERATION
( W168 ; 1997–2004 ) HISTORY Section::::First generation ( W168 ; 1997–2004 ) .
Section::::History .
In 1994 , Mercedes - Benz confirmed that it would be launching a compact car - the A - Class ( A 160 ) - by early 1997 , which would be the company 's first venture in this sector of the market ; it was hinted at this stage that the new car would be shorter than the average supermini but as spacious and practical inside as a large family car .
The A - Class was first revealed to the motoring press late in 1996 , and finally launched at the Frankfurt Motor Show in the autumn of 1997 , the W168 A - Class was quite unusual for Mercedes - Benz featuring a front wheel drive layout and unusual tall but yet short body .
One innovation of the W168 was a frontal - impact absorption system called the " Sandwich bar " ( see patents DE4326 9 and DE4400132 in the name of Mercedes - Benz ) .
In the event of a violent frontal impact , the engine and transmission would slide underneath the floor below the pedals rather than entering the passenger compartment .
This was the first complete exterior designed by Coventry University trained Steve Mattin , for which he was named Autocar magazine 's ' Designer of the Year ' .
Earlier , Mattin had mostly worked on design for the W210 E - Class in 1991 .
Concurrent to the W168 , he designed the exterior of the W220 S - Class .
The final design freeze occurred in January 1995 , at 32 months before August 1997 start of production .
The W168 became infamous in 1997 after flipping over during the traditional " elk test " performed by the Swedish automobile publication Teknikens Värld .
According to the report , the W168 overturned when manoeuvring to avoid the " elk " .
Mercedes initially denied the problem , but then took the surprising step of recalling all units sold to date ( 2,600 ) and suspending sales for three months until the problem was solved by adding electronic stability control and modifying the suspension .
The company spent DM 2.5 billion in developing the car , with a further DM 300 million to fix it .
Between 1997 and 2004 , 1.1 million first generation A - Class models had been sold .
The A - Class was facelifted in 2001 , with minor alterations to the headlights , front and rear bumper design and the addition of a new longer wheelbase version .
It was launched at the Geneva Motor Show .
ENGINES Section::::Engines .
All A - Class models are powered by four - cylinder engines , with 1.4 L and 1.6 L petrol models at launch ( M 166 series ) , followed by two versions of a 1.7 L diesel engine ( OM 668 series ) .
In 1999 , a larger 1.9 L petrol model was added , with the 2.1 the last W168 version to be launched in 2002 . ! width=40
