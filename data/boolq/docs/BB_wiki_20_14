STAINING
Staining is an auxiliary technique used in microscopy to enhance contrast in the microscopic image .
Stains and dyes are frequently used in biology and medicine to highlight structures in biological tissues for viewing , often with the aid of different microscopes .
Stains may be used to define and examine bulk tissues ( highlighting , for example , muscle fibers or connective tissue ) , cell populations ( classifying different blood cells , for instance ) , or organelles within individual cells .
In biochemistry it involves adding a class - specific ( DNA , proteins , lipids , carbohydrates ) dye to a substrate to qualify or quantify the presence of a specific compound .
Staining and fluorescent tagging can serve similar purposes .
Biological staining is also used to mark cells in flow cytometry , and to flag proteins or nucleic acids in gel electrophoresis .
Simple staining is staining with only one stain / dye .
There are various kinds of multiple staining , many of which are examples of counterstaining , differential staining , or both , including double staining and triple staining .
Staining is not limited to biological materials , it can also be used to study the morphology of other materials for example the lamellar structures of semi - crystalline polymers or the domain structures of block copolymers .
IN VIVO VS
IN VITRO Section::::In vivo vs In vitro .
In vivo staining ( also called vital staining or intravital staining ) is the process of dyeing living tissues — in vivo means " in life " ( compare with in vitro staining ) .
By causing certain cells or structures to take on contrasting colour(s ) , their form ( morphology ) or position within a cell or tissue can be readily seen and studied .
The usual purpose is to reveal cytological details that might otherwise not be apparent ; however , staining can also reveal where certain chemicals or specific chemical reactions are taking place within cells or tissues .
In vitro staining involves colouring cells or structures that have been removed from their biological context .
Certain stains are often combined to reveal more details and features than a single stain alone .
Combined with specific protocols for fixation and sample preparation , scientists and physicians can use these standard techniques as consistent , repeatable diagnostic tools .
A counterstain is stain that makes cells or structures more visible , when not completely visible with the principal stain .
* For example , crystal violet stains only Gram - positive bacteria in Gram staining .
A safranin counterstain is applied that stains all cells , allowing identification of Gram - negative bacteria .
While ex vivo , many cells continue to live and metabolize until they are " fixed " .
Some staining methods are based on this property .
Those stains excluded by the living cells but taken up by the already dead cells are called vital stains ( e.g. trypan blue or propidium iodide for eukaryotic cells ) .
Those that enter and stain living cells are called supravital stains ( e.g. New Methylene Blue and brilliant cresyl blue for reticulocyte staining ) .
However , these stains are eventually toxic to the organism , some more so than others .
Partly due to their toxic interaction inside a living cell , when supravital stains enter a living cell , they might produce a characteristic pattern of staining different from the staining of an already fixed cell ( e.g. " reticulocyte " look versus diffuse " polychromasia " ) .
To achieve desired effects , the stains are used in very dilute solutions ranging from to ( Howey , 2000 ) .
Note that many stains may be used in both living and fixed cells .
IN VITRO METHODS
PREPARATION Section::::In vitro methods .
Section::::Preparation .
The preparatory steps involved depend on the type of analysis planned ; some or all of the following procedures may be required .
Fixation – which may itself consist of several steps – aims to preserve the shape of the cells or tissue involved as much as possible .
Sometimes heat fixation is used to kill , adhere , and alter the specimen so it accepts stains .
Most chemical fixatives ( chemicals causing fixation ) generate chemical bonds between proteins and other substances within the sample , increasing their rigidity .
Common fixatives include formaldehyde , ethanol , methanol , and/or picric acid .
Pieces of tissue may be embedded in paraffin wax to increase their mechanical strength and stability and to make them easier to cut into thin slices .
Permeabilization involves treatment of cells with ( usually ) a mild surfactant .
This treatment dissolves cell membranes , and allows larger dye molecules into the cell 's interior .
Mounting usually involves attaching the samples to a glass microscope slide for observation and analysis .
In some cases , cells may be grown directly on a slide .
For samples of loose cells ( as with a blood smear or a pap smear ) the sample can be directly applied to a slide .
For larger pieces of tissue , thin sections ( slices ) are made using a microtome ; these slices can then be mounted and inspected .
STANDARDIZATION Section::::Standardization .
Most of the dyes commonly used in microscopy are available as BSC - certified stains .
This means that samples of the manufacturer 's batch have been tested by an independent body , the Biological Stain Commission ( BSC ) , and found to meet or exceed certain standards of purity , dye content and performance in staining techniques .
These standards are published in the Commission 's journal Biotechnic & Histochemistry .
Many dyes are inconsistent in composition from one supplier to another .
The use of BSC - certified stains eliminates a source of unexpected results .
Some vendors sell stains " certified " by themselves rather than by the Biological Stain Commission .
Such products may or may not be suitable for diagnostic and other applications .
NEGATIVE STAINING Section::::Negative staining .
A simple staining method for bacteria that is usually successful , even when the " positive staining " methods detailed below fail , is to use a negative stain .
This can be achieved by smearing the sample onto the slide and then applying nigrosin ( a black synthetic dye ) or India ink ( an aqueous suspension of carbon particles ) .
After drying , the microorganisms may be viewed in bright field microscopy as lighter inclusions well - contrasted against the dark environment surrounding them .
Note : negative staining is a mild technique that may not destroy the microorganisms , and is therefore unsuitable for studying pathogens .
SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES
GRAM STAINING
Section::::Specific techniques .
Section::::Gram staining .
Gram staining is used to determine gram status to classify bacteria broadly .
It is based on the composition of their cell wall .
Gram staining uses crystal violet to stain cell walls , iodine as a mordant , and a fuchsin or safranin counterstain to mark all bacteria .
Gram status is important in medicine ; the presence or absence of a cell wall changes the bacterium 's susceptibility to some antibiotics .
Gram - positive bacteria stain dark blue or violet .
Their cell wall is typically rich with peptidoglycan and lacks the secondary membrane and lipopolysaccharide layer found in Gram - negative bacteria .
On most Gram - stained preparations , Gram - negative organisms appear red or pink because they are counterstained .
Because of presence of higher lipid content , after alcohol - treatment , the porosity of the cell wall increases , hence the CVI complex ( crystal violet – iodine ) can pass through .
Thus , the primary stain is not retained .
Also , in contrast to most Gram - positive bacteria , Gram - negative bacteria have only a few layers of peptidoglycan and a secondary cell membrane made primarily of lipopolysaccharide .
ENDOSPORE STAINING
Section::::Endospore staining .
Endospore staining is used to identify the presence or absence of endospores , which make bacteria very difficult to kill .
This is particularly useful for identifying endospore - forming bacterial pathogens such as Clostridium difficile .
ZIEHL - NEELSEN STAIN Section::::Ziehl - Neelsen stain .
Ziehl - Neelsen staining is used to stain species of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that do not stain with the standard laboratory staining procedures such as Gram staining .
The stains used are the red coloured Carbol fuchsin that stains the bacteria and a counter stain such as Methylene blue HAEMATOXYLIN AND EOSIN ( H&E ) STAINING Section::::Haematoxylin and eosin
( H&E ) staining .
Haematoxylin and eosin staining protocol is used frequently in histology to examine thin sections of tissue .
Haematoxylin stains cell nuclei blue , while eosin stains cytoplasm , connective tissue and other extracellular substances pink or red .
Eosin is strongly absorbed by red blood cells , colouring them bright red .
In a skilfully made H & E preparation the red blood cells are almost orange , and collagen and cytoplasm ( especially muscle ) acquire different shades of pink .
When the staining is done by a machine , the subtle differences in eosinophilia are often lost .
Hematoxylin stains the cell nucleus and other acidic structures ( such as RNA - rich portions of the cytoplasm and the matrix of hyaline cartilage )
blue .
In contrast , eosin stains the cytoplasm and collagen pink .
PAPANICOLAOU STAINING
Section::::Papanicolaou staining .
Papanicolaou staining , or Pap staining , is a frequently used method for examining cell samples from various bodily secretions .
It is frequently used to stain Pap smear specimens .
It uses a combination of haematoxylin , Orange G , eosin Y , Light Green SF yellowish , and sometimes Bismarck Brown Y. PAS STAINING Section::::PAS staining .
Periodic acid - Schiff staining is used to mark carbohydrates ( glycogen , glycoprotein , proteoglycans ) .
It is used to distinguish different types of glycogen storage diseases .
MASSON 'S TRICHROME
Section::::Masson 's trichrome .
Masson 's trichrome is ( as the name implies ) a three - colour staining protocol .
The recipe has evolved from Masson 's original technique for different specific applications , but all are well - suited to distinguish cells from surrounding connective tissue .
Most recipes produce red keratin and muscle fibers , blue or green staining of collagen and bone , light red or pink staining of cytoplasm , and black cell nuclei .
ROMANOWSKY STAINS Section::::Romanowsky stains .
The Romanowsky stains are all based on a combination of eosinate ( chemically reduced eosin ) and methylene blue ( sometimes with its oxidation products azure A and azure B ) .
Common variants include Wright 's stain , Jenner 's stain , May - Grunwald stain , Leishman stain and Giemsa stain .
All are used to examine blood or bone marrow samples .
They are preferred over H&E for inspection of blood cells because different types of leukocytes ( white blood cells ) can be readily distinguished .
All are also suited to examination of blood to detect blood - borne parasites such as malaria .
SILVER STAINING Section::::Silver staining .
Silver staining is the use of silver to stain histologic sections .
This kind of staining is important especially to show proteins ( for example type III collagen ) and DNA .
It is used to show both substances inside and outside cells .
Silver staining is also used in temperature gradient gel electrophoresis .
Some cells are argentaffin .
These reduce silver solution to metallic silver after formalin fixation .
This method was discovered by Italian Camillo Golgi , by using a reaction between silver nitrate and potassium dichromate , thus precipitating silver chromate in some cells ( see Golgi 's method ) .
Other cells are argyrophilic .
These reduce silver solution to metallic silver after being exposed to the stain that contains a reductant , for example hydroquinone or formalin .
SUDAN STAINING
Section::::Sudan staining .
Sudan staining is the use of Sudan dyes to stain sudanophilic substances , usually lipids .
Sudan III , Sudan IV , Oil Red O , Osmium tetroxide , and Sudan Black B are often used .
Sudan staining is often used to determine the level of fecal fat to diagnose steatorrhea .
CONKLIN 'S STAINING
Section::::Conklin 's staining .
Special technique designed for staining true endospores with the use of malachite green dye , once stained , they do not decolourize .
COMMON BIOLOGICAL STAINS
Section::::Common biological stains .
Different stains react or concentrate in different parts of a cell or tissue , and these properties are used to advantage to reveal specific parts or areas .
Some of the most common biological stains are listed below .
Unless otherwise marked , all of these dyes may be used with fixed cells and tissues ; vital dyes ( suitable for use with living organisms ) are noted .
ACRIDINE ORANGE Section::::Acridine orange .
Acridine orange ( AO ) is a nucleic acid selective fluorescent cationic dye useful for cell cycle determination .
It is cell - permeable , and interacts with DNA and RNA by intercalation or electrostatic attractions .
When bound to DNA , it is very similar spectrally to fluorescein .
Like fluorescein , it is also useful as a non - specific stain for backlighting conventionally stained cells on the surface of a solid sample of tissue ( fluorescence backlighted staining ) .
BISMARCK BROWN Section::::Bismarck brown .
Bismarck brown ( also Bismarck brown Y or Manchester brown ) imparts a yellow colour to acid mucins .
CARMINE Section::::Carmine .
Carmine is an intensely red dye used to stain glycogen , while Carmine alum is a nuclear stain .
Carmine stains require the use of a mordant , usually aluminum .
COOMASSIE BLUE Section::::Coomassie blue .
Coomassie blue ( also brilliant blue )
nonspecifically stains proteins a strong blue colour .
It is often used in gel electrophoresis .
CRESYL VIOLET Section::::Cresyl violet .
Cresyl violet stains the acidic components of the neuronal cytoplasm a violet colour , specifically nissl bodies .
Often used in brain research .
CRYSTAL VIOLET
Section::::Crystal violet .
Crystal violet , when combined with a suitable mordant , stains cell walls purple .
Crystal violet is the stain used in Gram staining .
DAPI Section::::DAPI . DAPI is a fluorescent nuclear stain , excited by ultraviolet light and showing strong blue fluorescence when bound to DNA .
DAPI binds with A = T rich repeats of chromosomes .
DAPI is also not visible with regular transmission microscopy .
It may be used in living or fixed cells .
DAPI - stained cells are especially appropriate for cell counting .
EOSIN Section::::Eosin .
Eosin is most often used as a counterstain to haematoxylin , imparting a pink or red colour to cytoplasmic material , cell membranes , and some extracellular structures .
It also imparts a strong red colour to red blood cells .
Eosin may also be used as a counterstain in some variants of Gram staining , and in many other protocols .
There are actually two very closely related compounds commonly referred to as eosin .
Most often used is eosin Y ( also known as eosin Y ws or eosin yellowish ) ; it has a very slightly yellowish cast .
The other eosin compound is eosin B ( eosin bluish or imperial red ) ; it has a very faint bluish cast .
The two dyes are interchangeable , and the use of one or the other is more a matter of preference and tradition .
ETHIDIUM BROMIDE Section::::Ethidium bromide .
Ethidium bromide intercalates and stains DNA , providing a fluorescent red - orange stain .
Although it will not stain healthy cells , it can be used to identify cells that are in the final stages of apoptosis – such cells have much more permeable membranes .
Consequently , ethidium bromide is often used as a marker for apoptosis in cells populations and to locate bands of DNA in gel electrophoresis .
The stain may also be used in conjunction with acridine orange ( AO ) in viable cell counting .
This EB / AO combined stain causes live cells to fluoresce green whilst apoptotic cells retain the distinctive red - orange fluorescence .
ACID FUCHSINE Section::::Acid fuchsine .
Acid fuchsine may be used to stain collagen , smooth muscle , or mitochondria .
Acid fuchsine is used as the nuclear and cytoplasmic stain in Mallory 's trichrome method .
Acid fuchsine stains cytoplasm in some variants of Masson 's trichrome .
In Van Gieson 's picro - fuchsine , acid fuchsine imparts its red colour to collagen fibres .
Acid fuchsine is also a traditional stain for mitochondria ( Altmann 's method ) .
HAEMATOXYLIN
Section::::Haematoxylin .
Haematoxylin ( hematoxylin in North America ) is a nuclear stain .
Used with a mordant , haematoxylin stains nuclei blue - violet or brown .
It is most often used with eosin in H&E ( haematoxylin and eosin ) staining — one of the most common procedures in histology .
HOECHST STAINS
Section::::Hoechst stains .
Hoechst is a bis - benzimidazole derivative compound that binds to the minor groove of DNA .
Often used in fluorescence microscopy for DNA staining , Hoechst stains appear yellow when dissolved in aqueous solutions and emit blue light under UV excitation .
There are two major types of Hoechst : Hoechst 33258 and Hoechst 33342 .
The two compounds are functionally similar , but with a little difference in structure .
Hoechst 33258 contains a terminal hydroxyl group and is thus more soluble in aqueous solution , however this characteristics reduces its ability to penetrate the plasma membrane .
Hoechst 33342 contains an ethyl substitution on the terminal hydroxyl group ( i.e. an ethylether group ) making it more hydrophobic for easier plasma membrane passage
IODINE Section::::Iodine .
Iodine is used in chemistry as an indicator for starch .
When starch is mixed with iodine in solution , an intensely dark blue colour develops , representing a starch / iodine complex .
Starch is a substance common to most plant cells and so a weak iodine solution will stain starch present in the cells .
Iodine is one component in the staining technique known as Gram staining , used in microbiology .
Lugol 's solution or Lugol 's iodine ( IKI ) is a brown solution that turns black in the presence of starches and can be used as a cell stain , making the cell nuclei more visible .
Iodine is also used as a mordant in Gram 's staining , it enhances dye to enter through the pore present in the cell wall / membrane .
MALACHITE GREEN
Section::::Malachite green .
Malachite green ( also known as diamond green B or victoria green B ) can be used as a blue - green counterstain to safranin in the Gimenez staining technique for bacteria .
It can also be used to directly stain spores .
METHYL GREEN
Section::::Methyl green .
Methyl green is used commonly with bright - field , as well as fluorescence microscopes to dye the chromatin of cells so that they are more easily viewed .
METHYLENE BLUE Section::::Methylene blue .
Methylene blue is used to stain animal cells , such as human cheek cells , to make their nuclei more observable .
Also used to stain the blood film and used in cytology .
NEUTRAL RED
Section::::Neutral red .
Neutral red ( or toluylene red ) stains
Nissl substance red .
It is usually used as a counterstain in combination with other dyes .
NILE BLUE Section::::Nile blue .
Nile blue ( or Nile blue A )
stains nuclei blue .
It may be used with living cells .
NILE RED Section::::Nile red .
Nile red ( also known as Nile blue oxazone ) is formed by boiling Nile blue with sulfuric acid .
This produces a mix of Nile red and Nile blue .
Nile red is a lipophilic stain ; it will accumulate in lipid globules inside cells , staining them red .
Nile red can be used with living cells .
It fluoresces strongly when partitioned into lipids , but practically not at all in aqueous solution .
OSMIUM TETROXIDE ( FORMAL NAME : OSMIUM TETRAOXIDE )
Section::::Osmium tetroxide ( formal name : osmium tetraoxide ) .
Osmium tetraoxide is used in optical microscopy to stain lipids .
It dissolves in fats , and is reduced by organic materials to elemental osmium , an easily visible black substance .
PROPIDIUM IODIDE Section::::Propidium Iodide .
Propidium iodide is a fluorescent intercalating agent that can be used to stain cells .
Propidium iodide is used as a DNA stain in flow cytometry to evaluate cell viability or DNA content in cell cycle analysis , or in microscopy to visualise the nucleus and other DNA - containing organelles .
Propidium Iodide can not cross the membrane of live cells , making it useful to differentiate necrotic , apoptotic and healthy cells .
PI also binds to RNA , necessitating treatment with nucleases to distinguish between RNA and DNA staining RHODAMINE Section::::Rhodamine .
Rhodamine is a protein specific fluorescent stain commonly used in fluorescence microscopy .
SAFRANINE Section::::Safranine .
Safranine ( or Safranine O ) is a red cationic dye .
It binds to nuclei ( DNA ) and other tissue polyanions , including glycosaminoglycans in cartilage and mast cells , and components of lignin and plastids in plant tissues .
Safranine should not be confused with saffron , an expensive natural dye that is used in some methods to impart a yellow colour to collagen , to contrast with blue and red colours imparted by other dyes to nuclei and cytoplasm in animal ( including human ) tissues .
The incorrect spelling " safranin " is in common use .
The -ine ending is appropriate for safranine O because this dye is an amine , STAINABILITY OF TISSUES Section::::Stainability of tissues .
Tissues which take up stains are called chromatic .
Chromosomes were so named because of their ability to absorb a violet stain .
Positive affinity for a specific stain may be designated by the suffix -philic .
For example , tissues that stain with an azure stain may be referred to as azurophilic .
This may also be used for more generalized staining properties , such as acidophilic for tissues that stain by acidic stains ( most notably eosin ) ,
basophilic when staining in basic dyes , and amphophilic when staining with either acid or basic dyes .
In contrast , chromophobic tissues do not take up coloured dye readily .
ELECTRON MICROSCOPY Section::::Electron microscopy .
As in light microscopy , stains can be used to enhance contrast in transmission electron microscopy .
Electron - dense compounds of heavy metals are typically used .
PHOSPHOTUNGSTIC ACID Section::::Phosphotungstic acid .
Phosphotungstic acid is a common negative stain for viruses , nerves , polysaccharides , and other biological tissue materials .
OSMIUM TETROXIDE Section::::Osmium tetroxide .
Osmium tetroxide is used in optical microscopy to stain lipids .
It dissolves in fats , and is reduced by organic materials to elemental osmium , an easily visible black substance .
Because it is a heavy metal that absorbs electrons , it is perhaps the most common stain used for morphology in biological electron microscopy .
It is also used for the staining of various polymers for the study of their morphology by TEM .
is very volatile and extremely toxic .
It is a strong oxidizing agent as the osmium has an oxidation number of +8 .
It aggressively oxidizes many materials , leaving behind a deposit of non - volatile osmium in a lower oxidation state .
RUTHENIUM TETROXIDE Section::::Ruthenium tetroxide .
Ruthenium tetroxide is equally volatile and even more aggressive than osmium tetraoxide and able to stain even materials that resist the osmium stain , e.g. polyethylene .
Other chemicals used in electron microscopy staining include : ammonium molybdate , cadmium iodide , carbohydrazide , ferric chloride , hexamine , indium trichloride , lanthanum nitrate , lead acetate , lead citrate , lead(II )
nitrate , periodic acid , phosphomolybdic acid , potassium ferricyanide , potassium ferrocyanide , ruthenium red , silver nitrate , silver proteinate , sodium chloroaurate , thallium nitrate , thiosemicarbazide , uranyl acetate , uranyl nitrate , and vanadyl sulfate .
