AMERICA 'S
MOST WANTED
America 's Most Wanted is an American television program that was produced by 20th Television .
At the time of its cancellation by the Fox television network in June 2011 , it was the longest - running program in the network 's history ( 25 seasons ) , a mark since surpassed by The Simpsons .
The show started off as a half - hour program on February 7 , 1988 .
In 1990 , the show 's format was changed from 30 minutes to 60 minutes .

A short - lived syndicated spinoff titled America 's Most Wanted :
Final Justice aired during the 1995 - 96 season .
The following September , the show 's host , John Walsh , announced that it would resume later that year on the cable network Lifetime .
After a brief run on Lifetime , however , on March 28 , 2013 the show was canceled again .
This was reportedly due to low ratings and the level of royalty payments to Fox which holds the trademark and copyright .
It was succeeded by John Walsh Investigates , a one - off special on Lifetime .
The show featured reenactments of dangerous fugitives that are portrayed by actors , interspersed with on - camera interviews , with Walsh in a voiceover narration .
Each episode also featured photographs of dangerous fugitives , as well a toll - free hotline number where viewers could give information at 1 - 800-CRIME - TV .

Many of the series ' cases have some connection outside the United States or have not taken place in the United States at all .
The series ' first international capture was in Nova Scotia in 1989 .
With Walsh at the helm , America 's Most Wanted began to broaden its scope .
In addition to the regular segments narrated by Walsh , the show began to make room for more segments and correspondents .
The first two - hour quarterly special aired on Saturday , October 29 , 2011 on FOX .
The second two - hour special aired on Saturday , December 17 , 2011 , the third two - hour special aired on Saturday , February 11 , 2012 , and the fourth and final two - hour special aired on Saturday , April 21 , 2012 .
On July 13 , 2014 , a successor premiered on CNN called The Hunt with John Walsh , which adds more international stories to its predecessor .
HISTORY CONCEPTION AND EARLY AIRING Section::::History . Section::::Conception and early airing .
The concept for America 's Most Wanted originally came from a German show , Aktenzeichen XY ...
ungelöst
( German for File Reference XY ... Unsolved ) , that first aired in 1967 , and the British show Crimewatch , first aired in 1984 , with the US version conceived by Fox executive Stephen Chao and Executive Producer Michael Linder in the summer of 1987 .
Even earlier , however , CBS aired a three - month half - hour similar series hosted by Walter McGraw in the 1955–1956 season entitled Wanted .
While Linder was shooting the pilot episode in Indiana ,
Chao and Fox attorney Tom Herwitz conducted a hurried search for a host .
Chao 's first choice was former police officer and best - selling author
Joseph Wambaugh , but Wambaugh refused , saying he did n't believe a national dragnet would work in the United States .
Chao also considered asking then - recently resigned U.S. Attorney ( and future New York City mayor )
Rudolph Giuliani , former Virginia governor Chuck Robb and former Oklahoma governor Bob Curry before deciding a politician might use the show as a platform for personal political ambitions .
Other potential candidates included former Marine Corps Commandant General P. X. Kelly , journalists Linda Ellerbee and Bob Woodward , and victims ' advocate Theresa Saldana .
Then , during a marathon telephone conference call , Herwitz suggested John Walsh .
Walsh had gained publicity after his six - year - old son , Adam Walsh , was kidnapped and murdered in 1981 .
The crime had been the subject of the 1983 television film Adam , and Walsh 's later advocacy had resulted in new legislation to protect missing children , as well as the creation of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children .
After lengthy discussions , Walsh agreed to host the pilot episode .
America 's Most Wanted debuted as a half - hour program on February 7 , 1988 on seven Fox - owned stations .
Within four days of the first broadcast , FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitive David James Roberts was captured as a direct result .
He was a convicted killer who had recently escaped from prison by digging his way out with a small axe .
This demonstrated the effectiveness of the show 's " Watch Television , Catch Criminals " premise to skeptical law enforcement agencies .
Ten weeks later , the program premiered nationwide on the Fox network and became the fledgling network 's first hit series .
In 1990 , the show 's format was changed from 30 minutes to 60 minutes .
The show was cut back to 30 minutes in 1995 , and back to 60 minutes in 1996 .
From 1995 to 1996 , a short - lived syndicated spinoff titled America 's Most Wanted : Final Justice aired .
The announcer heard on the show from 1996 to 2008 was the late voice - over artist Don LaFontaine .
The first new episode aired after his death was dedicated to him .
He was replaced by voice actor Wes Johnson , who served in the role until end of the show 's run .
Notable writers have included Peter Koper and Greg Scott .
Logos
The show 's first logo ran from 1988 to 1990 , which consisted of an eagle sitting on a tree branch in a circle , with lines , stars , and zigzags below , and it has " AMERICA 'S MOST WANTED " written on it .
The show 's second and final logo ran from 1990 to 2012 , which would be used for the rest of the show 's run .
In 1996 , the show was retitled America 's Most Wanted : America Fights Back , which ran until 2003 .
1996 CANCELLATION AND REVIVAL Section::::1996 cancellation and revival .
The program was canceled for a month and a half in the fall of 1996 , per a decision made the previous spring in the wake of high production costs .
In its place , Fox moved Married ... with Children ( then entering what soon became its final season ) to 9/8c , with the new sitcom Love and Marriage following it at 9:30 .
Cops remained in its hour - long 8/7c block .
However , protests from the public , law enforcement , and government officials , including the governors of 37 states , encouraged Fox to bring the show back , though low ratings for Married ... and Love and Marriage ultimately sealed the return of AMW .
Love and Marriage was canceled , and Married ... was moved back to Sundays .
In 1996 , the show was retitled America 's Most Wanted : America Fights Back , which ran until 2003 .
For the next 15 years afterward , the America 's Most Wanted / COPS combination made Saturday evening
Fox 's most stable night , along with the longest unchanged primetime schedule on American television as of 2011 .
On March 6 , 2010 , Fox aired the 1000th episode of America 's Most Wanted , and Walsh interviewed then President Barack Obama at the White House .
In the interview , they discussed the Obama Administration 's crime - fighting initiatives , as well as the impact the show has had on law enforcement and crime prevention .
COVERING CRIMINALS IN THE WAR
ON TERRORISM
Section::::Covering criminals in the War on Terrorism .
The show expanded its focus to also cover criminals in the War on Terrorism when , on October 12 , 2001 an episode aired featuring 22 most - wanted al - Qaeda operatives .
The show was put together due to a request by White House aides after the same list of men had been released to the nation two days earlier .
However , the first show that focused mainly on terrorism aired after the September 11 attacks and was two hours long . 2011 FOX CANCELLATION , NETWORK CHANGE , AND EVENTUAL LIFETIME CANCELLATION
Section::::2011 Fox cancellation , network change , and eventual Lifetime cancellation .

However , Walsh said he was looking to other networks to keep the show going , saying he had " many , many offers " from other networks .
Fox News Channel confirmed that its chairman Roger Ailes had been in preliminary discussions with Walsh about bringing the show to Fox News , but said " nothing has been decided .
" On the final Fox episode , Walsh promised to continue the show elsewhere and told the Associated Press : " I want to catch bad guys and find missing children — and we 're not done . "

On September 28 , 2015 , he was arrested by immigration officials in Guadalajara , Mexico , where Jackson appeared to have been living for years using an alias .
He was transported back to the U.S. and is currently awaiting trial on kidnapping charges in Hillsboro .
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE Section::::Presumption of innocence .
Given that a significant number of the fugitives on America 's Most Wanted had yet to face trial in a criminal court , the show adhered to the presumption of innocence as afforded under the law .
For this reason , in the cases where fugitives had not yet been convicted , John Walsh would always proceed his narrative of the crime with the term " Police say ... " , "
According to police ... " , or a similar term followed by a description of the crime to which the person had allegedly committed .
In a special broadcast after the September 11 attacks , Walsh technically broke the show 's own rules regarding innocence presumption when he said " Let 's catch the bastards that did this ! "
in reference to the 9/11 masterminds .
In a handful of rare cases , America 's Most Wanted profiled persons who were involved in controversial cases or who had fled to avoid prosecution on what they believed to be unfair or even framed charges .
One female fugitive , who had fled to Canada , later had charges against her dismissed even after being profiled on the show .
In another case , a judge ordered a change of venue for a suspected child murderer after learning that nearly the entire county had seen the suspect profiled on America 's Most Wanted and believed him guilty .
During its entire run , Walsh refused to ever issue a retraction , and never updated viewers on any fugitives who were later found not guilty of the crimes to which they had been profiled .
