GAME OF THRONES ( SEASON 1 )
The first season of the fantasy drama television series Game of Thrones premiered on HBO on April 17 , 2011 in the U.S. , and concluded on June 19 , 2011 .
It consists of ten episodes , each of approximately 55 minutes .
The series is based on A Game of Thrones , the first novel in the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin , adapted for television by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss .
HBO had ordered a television pilot in November 2008 ; filming began the following year .
However , it was deemed unsatisfactory and later reshot with some roles being recast .
In March 2010 , HBO ordered the first season , which began filming in July 2010 , primarily in Belfast , Northern Ireland , with additional filming in Malta .
The story takes place in a fictional world , primarily upon a continent called Westeros , with one storyline occurring on another continent to the east known as Essos .
Like the novel , the season initially focuses on the family of nobleman Eddard Stark , who is asked to become chief advisor to his king and longtime friend , Robert Baratheon .
Ned must find out who killed the previous Hand of the King , Jon Arryn , while trying to protect his family from their rivals the Lannisters .
He uncovers the dark secrets about the Lannisters that his predecessor died trying to expose .
Meanwhile , in Essos , the exiled Viserys Targaryen , son of the former king , believes he still has the rightful claim to the throne .
Game of Thrones features a large ensemble cast , including Sean Bean , Mark Addy , Peter Dinklage , Lena Headey , Nikolaj Coster - Waldau , Michelle Fairley and Iain Glen .
Newer actors were cast as the younger generation of characters , such as Kit Harington , Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams .
Critics praised the show 's production values and cast , with specific accolades for Dinklage 's portrayal of Tyrion Lannister .
The first season won two of the thirteen Emmy Awards for which it was nominated , for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series ( Dinklage ) and Outstanding Main Title Design .
It also received a nomination for Outstanding Drama Series .
Bean and Emilia Clarke also received individual accolades , as did Ramin Djawadi for music .
U.S. viewership rose by approximately 33 % over the course of the season , from 2.2 million to over 3 million by the finale .

HBO originally optioned the rights to A Song of Ice and Fire in 2007 , at which time David Benioff and D. B. Weiss were identified as the project 's writers and executive producers .
The first and second drafts of the pilot script , written by Benioff and Weiss , were submitted in August 2007 , and June 2008 , respectively .
While HBO found both drafts to their liking , a pilot was not ordered until November 2008 , with the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike possibly delaying the process .
Benioff and Weiss served as main writers and showrunners for the first season .
They contributed eight out of ten episodes , including one co - written with Jane Espenson .
The two remaining episodes were written by Bryan Cogman and A Song of Ice and Fire author George R. R. Martin .
Tom McCarthy directed the original pilot , but much of this was later re - shot by Tim Van Patten as the pilot was reworked into the first episode of the complete season .
Van Patten also directed the second episode .
McCarthy is still credited as a consulting producer for the series ' first episode .
Brian Kirk and Daniel Minahan directed three episodes each , and Alan Taylor directed the final two .
Before Game of Thrones both Benioff and Weiss worked in film , and were unfamiliar with working on a television show .
This resulted in several first - season episodes being about 10 minutes too short for HBO , forcing them to write another 100 pages of scripts in two weeks .
Due to lack of budget the new scenes were designed to be inexpensive to film , such as two actors conversing in one room .
Benioff and Weiss noted that some of their favorite scenes from the first season were the results of the dilemma , including one between Robert and Cersei Baratheon discussing their marriage .
CASTING
Section::::Casting .
On May 5 , 2009 , it was announced that Peter Dinklage had been signed on to star as Tyrion Lannister in the pilot , and that Tom McCarthy was set to direct .
On July 19 , 2009 , a number of further casting decisions were announced , including Sean Bean being given the role of Ned Stark .
Other actors signed on for the pilot were Kit Harington in the role of Jon Snow , Jack Gleeson as Joffrey Baratheon , Harry Lloyd as Viserys Targaryen , and Mark Addy as Robert Baratheon .
At the beginning of August 2009 , it was revealed that Catelyn Stark would be portrayed by Jennifer Ehle .
On August 20 , more casting announcements were made , including Nikolaj Coster - Waldau as Jaime Lannister and Tamzin Merchant as Daenerys Targaryen , as well as Richard Madden in the role of Robb Stark , Iain Glen as Ser Jorah Mormont , Alfie Allen as Theon Greyjoy , Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark and Maisie Williams as Arya Stark .
On September 1 Lena Headey was announced as Cersei Lannister .
On September 23 , Martin confirmed that Rory McCann had been cast as Sandor Clegane .
Isaac Hempstead - Wright was confirmed as Bran Stark on October 14 , followed by an announcement of Jason Momoa as Khal Drogo three days later .
After the pilot was shot and the series picked up , it was announced that the role of Catelyn had been recast , with Michelle Fairley replacing Ehle .
Later , it was also confirmed that Emilia Clarke would replace Tamzin Merchant as Daenerys .
The rest of the cast was filled out in the second half of the year , and included Charles Dance as Tywin Lannister , Aidan Gillen as Petyr ' Littlefinger ' Baelish , and Conleth Hill as Varys .
FILMING
Section::::Filming .
The pilot episode was initially filmed on location in Northern Ireland , Scotland and Morocco by Tom McCarthy between October 24 and November 19 , 2009 .
However , the pilot was deemed unsatisfactory and much of it had to be reshot together with the other episodes of the season in Northern Ireland and Malta .
Most scenes were shot in Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland border counties .
Principal photography was scheduled to begin on July 26 , 2010 , with the primary studio location being the Paint Hall Studio in the Titanic Quarter of Belfast , Northern Ireland .
Among various locations for the initial shooting of the pilot in 2009 , Doune Castle in central Scotland was used as the location for Winterfell , including scenes at its great hall ( the great hall was later recreated in a soundstage in Northern Ireland ) .
Additional filming locations included Cairncastle at Larne , Shane 's Castle , and Tollymore Forest Park , all in Northern Ireland .
In the 2010 shooting of the series , Castle Ward was used as Winterfell instead of Doune Castle , with Cairncastle for some exterior Winterfell scenes .
The set for Castle Black was built at Magheramorne quarry .
The show 's presence in Northern Ireland and use of Paint Hall created hundreds of jobs for residents , and made the area " a hub for film and television production " .
The " King 's Landing " exterior scenes were shot at various locations in Malta , including the city of Mdina and the island of Gozo .
The filming in Malta resulted in controversy when a protected ecosystem was damaged by a subcontractor .
MUSIC Section::::Music .
The soundtrack to Game of Thrones was originally to be composed by Stephen Warbeck .
On February 2 , 2011 , only ten weeks prior to the show 's premiere , it was reported that Warbeck had left the project and Ramin Djawadi had been commissioned to write the music instead .
The music supervisor of Game of Thrones Evyen Klean first suggested Djawadi to Benioff and Weiss as the replacement for Warbeck , and although Djawadi was reluctant as he had other commitments at that time , they managed to persuade Djawadi to accept the project .
To give the series its own distinctive musical identity , according to Djawadi , the producers asked him not to use musical elements such as flutes or solo vocals that had already been successfully used by other major fantasy productions .
He mentioned that a challenge in scoring the series was its reliance on dialogue and its sprawling cast : on several occasions already - scored music had to be omitted so as not to get in the way of dialogue .
Djawadi said that he was inspired to write the main title music by an early version of the series 's computer - animated title sequence .
The title music is reprised as a global theme in the rest of the soundtrack , initially infrequently and as part of the theme of individual characters , then in full towards the end of season 1 during particularly important scenes .
RECEPTION CRITICAL RESPONSE Section::::Reception .
Section::::Critical response .
Anticipation for the series was described by various media outlets as very high , with a dedicated fan base closely following the show 's development .
By April 2011 , multiple entertainment news outlets had put it at the top of their lists of television events to look forward to in 2011 .
The majority of reviews for the first season were very positive , with critics noting the high production values , the well - realized world , compelling characters , and giving particular note to the strength of the child actors .
Tim Goodman 's review for The Hollywood Reporter stated , " a few minutes into HBO 's epic Game of Thrones series , it 's clear that the hype was right and the wait was worth it " .
Mary McNamara from the Los Angeles Times called it " ... a great and thundering series of political and psychological intrigue bristling with vivid characters , cross - hatched with tantalizing plotlines and seasoned with a splash of fantasy " .
New York Post 's Linda Stasi gave Thrones 3.5/4 stars stating , "
The art direction , acting and incredible sets are as breathtaking as the massive scope of the series " .
Many critics praised Peter Dinklage for his portrayal of Tyrion Lannister , with Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly stating , " ... if Dinklage does n't get an Emmy for his clever , rude Tyrion Lannister , I 'll be gobsmacked " and Mary McNamara from the Los Angeles Times stating , " If the man does n't win an Emmy , heads should certainly roll . "
The first season of Game of Thrones has a Metacritic average of 80 out of 100 based on 28 critic reviews , categorized as " generally favorable " .
On Rotten Tomatoes , the first season has an 90 % approval rating from 36 critics with an average rating of 8.39 out of 10 .
