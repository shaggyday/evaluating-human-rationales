NCAA DIVISION
I MEN 'S BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT UPSETS
An upset is a victory by an underdog team .
In the context of the NCAA Division I Men 's Basketball Tournament , a single - elimination tournament , this generally constitutes a lower seeded team defeating a higher - seeded ( i.e. , higher - ranked ) team ; a widely recognized upset is one performed by a team ranked substantially lower than its opponent .
This is the list of victories by teams seeded 11 or lower in the tournament since it expanded to 64 teams in 1985 ; as these low - seeded teams were automatically paired against higher - seeded teams at the start of the tournament , their opening victories are almost always considered upsets ( to date only one 11th or lower seeded team in the first round won having been the betting " favorite " ; this occurred in 2017
when twelfth seeded Middle Tennessee defeated fifth seeded Minnesota in the Round of 64 ) .
Most victories by these teams in later rounds were usually against better seeded opponents as well .
On March 16 , 2018 , the University of Maryland , Baltimore County ( UMBC ) Retrievers became the first 16-seed to upset a 1-seed when they defeated the Virginia Cavaliers 74–54 in the first round .
ROUND OF 64 Section::::Round of 64 .
This round was called the First Round until 2011 , when the introduction of the First Four caused the round to be renamed the Second Round .
Starting with the 2016 tournament , it returned to being called the First Round .
There were ten wins by double - digit seeds in 2016 , which was the most in tournament history .
In 2001 and 2012 , there were nine upsets during First Round play .
16 VS .
1 Section::::16 vs. 1 .
Before 2018 , 16-seeded teams were 0 - 135 against 1-seeds .
There were multiple occurrences of a 16-seed getting within single digits , with the most recent being Weber State losing to top - seeded Arizona 68 - 59 in 2014 .
Twice had a 16-seeded team come within one point of winning , both times in 1989 .
Top seeded Georgetown squeaked out a 50 - 49 win against Princeton , and East Tennessee State had a 17-point lead on Oklahoma , before the Sooners came back and won 72 - 71 .
The only time a 16 has ever taken a 1-seed into overtime came in 1990 , when Murray State ultimately lost to Michigan State 75 - 71 after an extra period .
There has only been one game where a 16-seed beat a 1-seed ( 0.74 % ) since 1985 , out of 136 games played :
