BANKNOTES OF NORTHERN IRELAND Banknotes have been issued for use specifically in Northern Ireland since 1929 , and are denominated in pounds sterling .
They are legal currency , but technically not legal tender anywhere ( including Northern Ireland itself ) .
However , the banknotes are still widely accepted as currency by larger merchants and institutions elsewhere in the United Kingdom .
Issuing banks have been granted legal rights to issue currency , and back the notes with deposits at the Bank of England .
The issuing of banknotes in Northern Ireland is regulated by the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1928 , the Coinage Act 1971 , Banknotes ( Ireland ) Act 1864 ( c. 78 ) , Banknotes ( Ireland ) Act 1920 ( c. 24 ) , Bankers ( Ireland ) Act 1845 , Bankers ( Northern Ireland ) Act 1928 ( c. 15 ) , among others .
Pursuant to some of these statutes , Her Majesty 's Revenue and Customs publishes in the Belfast Gazette an account of " the Amount of Notes authorised by Law to be issued by the several Banks of Issue in Northern Ireland , and the Average Amount of Notes in Circulation , and of Bank of England Notes and Coin held " ;
see for example Issue 6800 published on 8 September 2006 at page 5874 .

Of these denominations , only the 1 pound has ceased to be issued by all banks , with the last produced by the Allied Irish Banks in 1984 .
The 5 pound note is only issued now by Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank , and Northern Bank stopped issuing notes over £ 20 when it was rebranded as Danske Bank .
BANK OF IRELAND NOTES Section::::Bank of Ireland notes .
Until April 2008 , all Bank of Ireland notes featured Queen 's University of Belfast on the reverse side .
A new series of £ 5 , £ 10 and £ 20 notes was issued in May 2008 , all featuring an illustration of the Old Bushmills Distillery , and these notes will gradually replace the previous series .
The various denominations are differentiated by their colour and size : * 5 pound note , blue * 10 pound note , pink * 20 pound note , green * 50 pound note , blue - green .
FIRST TRUST BANK NOTES Section::::First Trust Bank notes .
First Trust Bank is a subsidiary of the Allied Irish Banks ( AIB ) .
AIB was originally formed in 1966 from a merger of a group of smaller banks .
Following this merger , banknotes issued by the Provincial Bank of Ireland were reissued with the Allied Irish Banks name .
In 1991 , AIB merged with TSB Northern Ireland and began trading as the First Trust Bank , and since then , the bank 's notes have been issued under the First Trust Bank name .
First Trust Bank 's current notes have a generic depiction of a Northern Irish person .
A young middle - aged man appears on the £ 10 note , an elderly woman on the £ 20 note , an elderly man on the £ 50 note , and finally both elderly people together on the £ 100 note .
The obverse designs generally feature images associated with the Spanish Armada , commemorating the wrecking of 24 Armada ships off the coast of County Antrim in 1588 : * 10 pound note featuring the ship Girona * 20 pound note featuring the chimney at Lacada Point , Giant 's Causeway , near Dunluce , County Antrim , where the Girona was wrecked * 50 pound note featuring a commemorative medal * 100 pound note featuring the Spanish Armada
A £ 5 note featuring Dunluce Castle on the obverse and a £ 1 note also featuring the Girona were issued by the Provincial Bank of Ireland and by AIB , but have not been issued by First Trust Bank .
DANSKE BANK / NORTHERN BANK
NOTES Section::::Danske Bank / Northern Bank notes .
Following the £ 26.5 million pound robbery in 2004 at Northern Bank 's money handling centre in Belfast , Northern Bank announced , on 7 January 2005 , that all its notes were to be recalled and reissued in different colours and styles , and using the bank 's new logo .
The reissue began on 14 March 2005 and was scheduled to take one month ; old notes remain exchangeable at branches of Northern Bank .
In 2012 , Northern Bank adopted the name of its Copenhagen - based parent company Danske Bank Group and now trades as Danske Bank .
Northern Bank had previously been a subsidiary of the Midland Bank and subsequently National Australia Bank , and its banknote design has changed over the years as the company changed hands .
In June 2013 , the bank issued a new series of £ 10 and £ 20 notes bearing the new Danske Bank name in place of Northern Bank ; at the same time it also announced that it would cease production of £ 50 and £ 100 notes , supplying Bank of England notes instead .
Older notes bearing the Northern Bank name will continue in circulation for some time as they are gradually withdrawn , and remain acceptable forms of payment .
Most Danske Bank banknotes depict a range of notable people associated with industry in Northern Ireland on the obverse .
The reverse of each note has an illustration of the portico of Belfast City Hall , sculpted by F. W. Pomeroy .
The principal colours of Northern Bank notes of greater than £ 5 face value were changed with the 2005 reissue , and are now ( former colour in pre-2004 column ) : !

Post-2004
While Danske Bank does not issue £ 5 notes , a special commemorative £ 5 note was issued by the Northern Bank to mark the Year 2000 .
Uniquely among sterling notes , this was a polymer banknote , printed by the Canadian Bank Note Company ( CBN ) on Australia synthetic polymer substrate instead of paper , making Northern Ireland the first part of the UK to have issued a plastic banknote .
It is the only one of the bank 's pre-2004 notes still in circulation ; all others were recalled following the 2004 robbery .
( The Isle of Man issued a polymer £ 1 note between 1983 and 1988 , but the island is a Crown Dependency , and not part of the UK . )
ULSTER BANK NOTES Section::::Ulster Bank notes .
Ulster Bank 's current notes all share a rather plain design of a view of Belfast harbour flanked by landscape views ; the design of the reverse is dominated by the bank 's coat of arms .
The principal difference between the denominations is their colour and size .
Notes issued from 1 January 2007 feature the bank 's new logo , similar to the Royal Bank of Scotland Group logo .
It appears beside the bank 's name , which appears in a different typeface , and in the place of the NatWest chevron foil device .
* 5 pound note , grey .
* 10 pound note , blue - green .
* 20 pound note , purple .
* 50 pound note , blue .
In November 2006 Ulster Bank issued its first commemorative banknote – an issue of one million £ 5 notes commemorating the first anniversary of the death of Northern Irish footballer George Best .
This was the first Ulster Bank banknote to incorporate their new logo , similar to the logo of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group , and the entire issue was taken by collectors within hours of becoming available in bank branches .
Ulster Bank plans to release a new series of polymer banknotes in 2019 , while also replacing its paper notes currently in circulation .
