EPISODES
PRODUCTION
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Production .
Section::::Development .
The series was based on the work of the same name by Charles Forsman .
Originally self - published as a series of mini - comics , the series was published as a graphic novel by Fantagraphics Books in 2013 .
It was republished in hardback in 2017 , in anticipation of the television series .
While Forsman was publishing the mini - comics , Jonathan Entwistle contacted him about adapting it to a visual format â€“
the original idea was to make an American film , and later a web series was considered .
A film was pitched to Film4 , and Entwistle was given funding for a short .
Made in 2014 , it featured some cast and crew who continued their roles for the television series .
Entwistle directed and Dominic Buchanan was producer ; Jessica Barden played Alyssa .
However , instead of Alex Lawther , James was played by Craig Roberts .
Though the short was well - received , no production companies wanted to invest in the idea as a full - length film .
Entwistle and Buchanan decided to make a television series with Clerkenwell Films , following which Channel 4 and then Netflix became involved .
Forsman had no official role in the show 's production , wanting to continue working on his comics , though Entwistle would regularly consult him and keep him updated .
In August 2018 , Channel 4 's director of programmes Ian Katz expressed frustration that many people think the programme is a Netflix original , saying that " it 's absolutely a Channel 4 show " .
The programme 's plot differs from that of Forsman 's comics .
In print , the two kill a satanist serial killer , whose wife was a police officer ;
instead the television series features police officers Eunice Noon and Teri Darego , and does not show the serial killer to be a satanist .
Another major difference is the ending of the graphic novel : the satanist police officer chases after James , and the two begin to attack each other , while police try to break up the fight .
There is then a gunshot .
In the final scene , Alyssa 's mother talks about her daughter being safe from James , while Alyssa is seen carving the name " JAMES " into her arm .
Some critics interpreted this to mean that James was dead , but Forsman sees the ending as ambiguous .
FILMING
Section::::Filming .
The first series began filming in April 2017 and concluded a few weeks before the show 's release in October 2017 .
Though filmed in England , the programme has an American tone to it ; Entwistle was inspired by Twin Peaks and Fargo .
Episodes were filmed largely in suburban areas and across Surrey , with locations such as Woking , Bracknell and Longcross Studios .
Another filming location was Leysdown - on - Sea on the Isle of Sheppey .
Entwistle uses mostly close - up shots , particularly in early episodes where most frames feature only one character .
He uses this for deadpan humour , by moving from face to face to get shots of characters ' reactions .
The series is set in the present day , but Entwistle aimed to make it feel like it could have been set " any time from 1988 to 2006 " .
Additionally , diners have a 1970s - style design , and the soundtrack features songs from the 1950s , 60s and 70s , along with original music from Graham Coxon , the founding member of Blur .
Entwistle describes Coxon 's scores as " guitar - based suburban noir " , and notes that more of his music is used in later episodes for the police officers .
CONTINUATION Section::::Continuation .
The first series covered the entirety of the storyline in Forsman 's original comics .
On 25 January 2018 , Jonathan Entwistle spoke of the potential for a second series .
He confirmed that " We 're exploring and we 're seeing what we can do to expand the world and see where we get to . "
Entwistle then went on to say that Netflix was enthusiastic about a second series of the show if one could be conceived .
Writer Charlie Covell said " I think there are a number of stories we could tell " and that she would " love to write more " .
Actor Alex Lawther stated in an interview that he would be " very excited " for a second series , as it would give Covell " a chance to explore something from her imagination " .
A second series was announced on 21 August 2018 on the official Channel 4 Twitter account .
