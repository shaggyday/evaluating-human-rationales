ROUTING NUMBER ( CANADA )
A routing number is the term for bank codes in Canada .
Routing numbers consist of eight numerical digits with a dash between the fifth and sixth digit for paper financial documents encoded with magnetic ink character recognition and nine numerical digits without dashes for electronic funds transfers .
Routing numbers are regulated by Payments Canada , formerly known as the Canadian Payments Association , to allow easy identification of the branch location and financial institution associated with an account .
FORMAT Section::::Format .
A routing number consists of a five digit transit number ( also called branch number ) identifying the branch where an account is held and a three digit financial institution number corresponding to the financial institution .
The number is given as one of the following forms , where XXXXX is the transit number and YYY is the financial institution number : * for MICR - encoded documents * for electronic funds transfers
A leading zero is used when formatting a routing number for electronic payments .

NUMBERS Section::::Transit numbers .
Each branch in a financial institution is assigned a unique transit number for identification .
The final digit of the transit number indicates the geographical location of the branch .
The association is as follows : * for British Columbia and Yukon * for western Quebec , including Montreal and surrounding areas * for southern Ontario , including Toronto and surrounding area * for Nova Scotia , Prince Edward Island and the island of Newfoundland * for New Brunswick * for eastern Quebec and Labrador * for eastern Ontario , including Ottawa and surrounding area * for Manitoba and north - western
Ontario * for Saskatchewan * for Alberta , the Northwest Territories and Nunavut
Therefore , a number would indicate that the associated account is held at a branch of the Toronto - Dominion Bank located in eastern Ontario .
