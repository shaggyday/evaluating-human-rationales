HAIR HANG
The hair hang is an aerial circus act where performers ( usually young women ) are suspended by their hair , acrobatic poses and/or manipulation .
Some believe the act originated in South America ; others claim the act hails from China .
Performers are literally hanging by their hair , which is tied into a hairhang rig ; the techniques used to tie the performer 's hair , and the acrobatic techniques involved in the act , are key .
Many people underestimate the tensile strength of hair .
A single strand can potentially carry a weight of up to 100 grams ; holding this in theory , and with proper technique , a full head of human hair could eventually hold between 5,600 kg and 8,400 kg ( 12,345 - 18518 lbs . ) , without breaking individual hairs or pulling out any follicles .
However , the act still hurts , especially for new performers .
