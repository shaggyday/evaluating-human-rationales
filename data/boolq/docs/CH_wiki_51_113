ENGLAND WOMEN 'S NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM
The England women 's national football team has been governed by the Football Association ( FA ) since 1993 , having been previously administered by the Women 's Football Association ( WFA ) .
England played its first international match in November 1972 against Scotland .
Although most national football teams represent a sovereign state , as a member of the United Kingdom 's Home Nations , England is permitted by FIFA statutes to maintain its own national side that competes in all major tournaments , with the exception of the Women 's Olympic Football Tournament .
England have qualified for the FIFA Women 's World Cup four times , reaching the quarter - final stage on the first three occasions in 1995 , 2007 , and 2011 , and finishing third in 2015 .
They reached the final of the UEFA Women 's Championship in 1984 and 2009 .
HISTORY EARLY YEARS Section::::History .
Section::::Early years .
The success of the men 's national football team at the 1966 FIFA World Cup led to an upsurge of interest in football from women within England .
The Women 's Football Association ( WFA ) was established a few years later in 1969 as an attempt to organise the women 's game .
That same year , Harry Batt formed an independent English team that competed in the Fédération Internationale Européenne de Football Féminine ( FIEFF ) European Cup .
Batt 's team also participated in two FIEFF World Cups held in Italy ( 1970 ) and Mexico ( 1971 ) .
Following an UEFA recommendation in 1972 for national associations to incorporate the women 's game , the Football Association ( FA ) rescinded its fifty - year ban on women playing on Football League grounds .
Shortly after , Eric Worthington was tasked by the WFA to assemble an official women 's national team .
England competed in its first international match against Scotland in Greenock on 18 November 1972 , almost 100 years after the first men 's international .
The team overturned a two - goal deficit to defeat their northern opponents by 3 goals to 2 , with Sylvia Gore scoring England 's first international goal .
Tom Tranter replaced Worthington as long term manager of the women 's national football team and remained in that position for the next six years .
1979–1993 :
PROGRESS
UNDER REAGAN
Section::::1979–1993 : Progress under Reagan .
Martin Reagan was appointed to replace Tranter in 1979 .
England reached the final of the inaugural European Competition for Women 's Football , after beating Denmark 3–1 on aggregate in the semi - finals .
Despite resolute defending , including a spectacular goal line clearance from captain Carol Thomas , the England team lost the first away leg 1–0 against Sweden , after a header from Pia Sundhage , but won the second home leg by the same margin , with a goal from Linda Curl .
England lost the subsequent penalty shootout 4–3 .
Theresa Wiseman saved Helen Johansson 's penalty but both Curl and Lorraine Hanson
had their spot kicks saved by Elisabeth Leidinge .
At the 1987 European Competition for Women 's Football , England again reached the semi - finals but lost 3–2 after extra time against holders Sweden , in a repeat of the previous final .
The team settled for fourth , after losing the third place play off against Italy 2–1 .
Reagan was sacked after England 's 6–1 quarter - final loss against Germany at UEFA Women 's Euro 1991 , which left them unable to qualify for the inaugural FIFA Women 's World Cup .
John Bilton was appointed as head coach in 1991 after Barrie Williams 's brief tenure .
1993–1998 :
FA INVOLVEMENT
Section::::1993–1998 :
FA involvement .
In 1993 , the FA took over the running of women 's football in England from the WFA , replacing Bilton with Ted Copeland as national team manager .
England managed to qualify for UEFA Women 's Euro 1995 , having previously missed out on the last three editions , but were beaten 6–2 on aggregate over two legs against Germany .
Reaching the European semi - finals granted England a place at the World Cup for the first time .
The team advanced from the group stages of the 1995 FIFA Women 's World Cup in Sweden , but lost out again to Germany 3–0 in the quarter - finals .
1998–2013
: DEVELOPMENT UNDER POWELL Section::::1998–2013 : Development under Powell .
Hope Powell became the team 's first full - time head coach in June 1998 , succeeding her former coach Copeland .
The European Championship expanded in 1997 to eight teams and moved from a biennial event to a quadrennial one .
England qualified via the play offs for the 2001 competition held in Germany , despite recording their biggest loss ( away against Norway 8–0 ) during qualification , but did not advance past the group stages .
England automatically qualified as hosts in 2005 , but again did not make it to the semi - finals .
Qualification for the World Cup changed for the 1999 edition .
European qualifiers were introduced , so that teams no longer needed to rely on advancing to the latter stages of the European Championship .
England qualified unbeaten for the 2007 World Cup in China , winning Group 5 in the European qualifiers and recording their biggest win ( away against Hungary , 13–0 ) in the process , ending a 12-year hiatus from the competition .
After coming second in their group , they advanced into the quarter - finals to face the United States but lost 3–0 .
In May 2009 , central contracts were implemented to help players focus on full - time training without having to fit it around full - time employment .
Three months later , at the European Championships in Finland , England marked their return to the recently expanded twelve team competition by reaching the final for the first time in 25 years .
They advanced from Group C to the quarter - finals by virtue of being the top third placed team , beating both the hosts and the Netherlands in the knockout stages on the way to the final .
There they lost 6–2 to reigning champions Germany .
England reached their third World Cup in 2011 , having won Group 5 and their play off 5–2 over two legs against Switzerland .
In Germany , they topped Group B – ahead of eventual winners Japan .
England were paired with France in the quarter - finals , with the match ending in a 1–1 draw .
England had taken the lead with Jill Scott 's chip , only to have Élise Bussaglia equalise with two minutes remaining .
After extra time ended in stalemate , they lost the ensuing penalty shootout 4–3 .
Karen Bardsley had saved Camille Abily 's initial penalty but misses by Claire Rafferty and Faye White sent England out of the competition .
Powell left the role in August 2013 after a poor showing at the UEFA Women 's Euro 2013 , with England bowing out early at the group stages .
2013–2017 : SAMPSON ERA
Section::::2013–2017 :

England had not played Germany since their heavy defeat in the European Championship final five years earlier .
They lost the match 3–0 , marking the 20th attempt at which England had failed to record an official win over Germany .
At the 2015 FIFA Women 's World Cup in Canada , England lost their opening group game to France but won their remaining group games against Mexico and Colombia , easing through to the last 16 to play 1995 champions Norway .
A 2–1 win set up a meeting with hosts Canada in the quarter - finals .
Despite facing not only a strong Canadian team but a capacity partisan crowd at BC Place in Vancouver , England progressed to the semifinals of the Women 's World Cup for the first time in their history with another 2–1 win .
Playing reigning World Cup holders Japan in the semi - finals , England conceded a penalty kick , which Aya Miyama converted past Karen Bardsley .
Japan then conceded a penalty as Yuki Ogimi clipped Steph Houghton and Fara Williams slotted it past Ayumi Kaihori to level the game .
However , in the last minute of the game , Laura Bassett scored an own goal to send Japan through to the final .
England eventually finished in third place by beating Germany 1–0 after extra time .
England qualified for the UEFA Women 's Euro 2017 in the Netherlands and won all three of their group games at the tournament .
England beat France 1–0 in the quarter - finals before meeting hosts and eventual champions , the Netherlands .
In the semi - finals , England conceded three goals without reply and were knocked out of the tournament .

England do not participate in the Women 's Olympic Football Tournament , as the country does not have its own National Olympic Committee ( NOC ) .
Members of its team have played for the Great Britain women 's Olympic football team at the 2012 Summer Olympics .
Since England falls under the jurisdiction of the British Olympic Association , remit for an Olympic football team requires support from all four Home Nation associations .
The Scottish Football Association ( SFA ) , the Football Association of Wales ( FAW ) and the Irish Football Association ( IFA ) have all previously objected to the premise over fears that the team would erode the independence of their individual football associations .
