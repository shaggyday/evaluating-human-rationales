MAKAPANSGAT PEBBLE
The Makapansgat pebble ( ca . 3,000,000 BP ) is a 260-gram reddish - brown jasperite cobble with natural chipping and wear patterns that make it look like a crude rendition of a human face .
The pebble is interesting in that it was found some distance from any possible natural source , associated with the bones of Australopithecus africanus in a cave in Makapansgat , South Africa .
Though it is definitely not a manufactured object , it has been suggested that some australopithecine might have recognized it as a symbolic face , in possibly the earliest example of symbolic thinking or aesthetic sense in the human heritage , and brought the pebble back to the cave .
This would make it a candidate for the oldest known manuport .
The teacher Wilfred I. Eizman found it in the Makapansgat , a dolerite cave in the Makapan Valley north of Mokopane , Limpopo , South Africa in 1925 .
Almost 50 years later , Raymond Dart was the first to describe it in 1974 .
The Makapansgat pebble can not be seen as art if a usual definition of the term is used , as the object was found and not made .
Nevertheless that an Australopithecus may have recognized a face would reveal that the early hominid had some sort of capacity for symbolic thinking , necessary for the development of art and language .
If the early hominid has seen this object really as a face , or had magical speculations towards this object or just enjoyed the pebble remains unclear .
