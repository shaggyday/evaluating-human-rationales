NATIONAL CURRICULUM
A national curriculum is a common programme of study in schools that is designed to ensure nationwide uniformity of content and standards in education .
It is usually legislated by the national government , possibly in consultation with state or other regional authorities .

The United States notably does not have one ; the establishment of a national curriculum was explicitly banned in 1965 , in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act .
This act provided federal funding for primary and secondary education ( ' Title I funding ' ) as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson 's War on Poverty .
However , most states in the United States voluntarily abide by the Common Core State Standards Initiative , which provides certain uniform standards , See Education in the United States .
