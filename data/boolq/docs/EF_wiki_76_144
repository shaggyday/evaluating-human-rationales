LIST OF FIFA WORLD CUP FINALS
The FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition established in 1930 .
It is contested by the men 's national teams of the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association ( FIFA ) , the sport 's global governing body .
The tournament has taken place every four years , except in 1942 and 1946 , when the competition was cancelled due to World War II .
The most recent World Cup , hosted by Russia in 2018 , was won by France , who beat Croatia 4–2 in regulation time .
The World Cup final match is the last of the competition , and the result determines which country is declared world champions .
If after 90 minutes of regular play the score is a draw , an additional 30-minute period of play , called extra time , is added .
If such a game is still tied after extra time , it is then decided by a penalty shoot - out .
The team winning the penalty shoot - out are then declared champions .
The tournament has been decided by a one - off match on every occasion except 1950 , when the tournament winner was decided by a final round - robin group contested by four teams ( Uruguay , Brazil , Sweden , and Spain ) .
Uruguay 's 2–1 victory over Brazil was the decisive match ( and one of the last two matches of the tournament ) which put them ahead on points and ensured that they finished top of the group as world champions .
Therefore , this match is regarded by FIFA as the de facto final of the 1950 World Cup .
In the 21 tournaments held , 79 nations have appeared at least once .
Of these , 13 have made it to the final match , and eight have won .
With five titles , Brazil is the most successful World Cup team and also the only nation to have participated in every World Cup finals tournament .
Italy and Germany have four titles .
Current champion France , along with past champions Uruguay and Argentina , have two titles each , while England and Spain have one each .
The team that wins the finals receive the FIFA World Cup Trophy , and their name is engraved on the bottom side of the trophy .
The 1970 and 1994 , along with the 1986 , 1990 and 2014 games are to date the only matches competed by the same teams ( Brazil – Italy and Argentina – Germany respectively ) .
As of 2018 , the 1934 final remains the latest final to have been between two teams playing their first final .
The final match of the most recent tournament in Russia took place at the country 's biggest sports complex , the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow .
The 1930 and the 1966 games are the only ones that did not take place on a Sunday .
The former did on a Wednesday and the latter on a Saturday .
As of 2018 , only nations from Europe and South America have competed in a World Cup final .
Six nations have won the final as host : Uruguay , Italy , England , Germany , Argentina and France .
Two nations have lost the final as host : Brazil and Sweden .
