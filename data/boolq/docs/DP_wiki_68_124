CONTENT Section::::Content .
The song tells the story of two young lovers dealing with difficult scenarios at three different stages in their lives .
In each situation , the man does all he can to make sure that different people " do n't take the girl . "
In the first verse , the young man ( Johnny ) is eight years old , about to go on a fishing trip with his father .
A young , unnamed girl , apparently Johnny 's age , is also present , with a fishing pole in her hand .
Johnny does n't want the girl to come fishing with them .
So he begs his father to " take any boy in the world / Daddy please , do n't take the girl " .
The song 's second verse finds Johnny and the girl ten years later , now as teenagers â€” the two have since fallen in love and are now dating .
As Johnny and his girlfriend are on a date at the " picture show " ( i.e. , the movie theater ) , they encounter a lone robber with a gun .
The robber grabs the girl and tells Johnny to give in to his demands .
Johnny surrenders his money , wallet , credit cards , a watch that his grandfather gave him , and even his car keys so that the girl would be safe ( in the music video , the crook 's only seen running away with the wallet ) .
Verse three takes place five years after the second verse .
At this point , Johnny and the girl are now ( presumably ) married and expecting their first child , and the girl is eventually rushed to the hospital to have her baby delivered .
The baby ( a boy ) is safely delivered , but the doctor informs Johnny that his wife is " fading fast " ( presumably dying of childbirth complications ) .
Johnny then collapses to his knees and prays to God that his wife survives , even asking that his own life be taken instead of his wife 's as long as she 's okay .
The music video shows that Johnny 's wife does indeed survive .
The song ends with a repeat of the song 's opening line : "
Johnny 's daddy was taking him fishin ' when he was eight years old " .
