PAID IN CAPITAL Paid in capital , paid - in capital or paid up capital , or contributed capital is capital that is contributed to a corporation by investors by purchase of stock from the corporation , the primary market , not by purchase of stock in the open market from other stockholders ( the secondary market ) .
It includes share capital ( capital stock ) as well as additional paid - in capital .
The paid - in capital account does not reflect the amount of capital contributed by any specific investor .
Instead , it shows the aggregate amount of capital contributed by all investors .
However , the term has different definitions in different contexts .
For example , it could refer to the money that a company gets from potential investors , in addition to the stated ( nominal or par ) value of the stock , which coincides with the definition of additional paid - in capital , or paid - in capital in excess of par .
One should be aware of the use of the term and the abbreviation , which can confuse .
