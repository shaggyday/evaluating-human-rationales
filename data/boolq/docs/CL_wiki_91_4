THE GRASS
ROOTS
The Grass Roots is an American rock band that charted frequently between 1966 and 1975 .
The band was originally the creation of Lou Adler and songwriting duo P. F. Sloan and Steve Barri .
In their career , they achieved two gold albums , one gold single and charted singles on the Billboard Hot 100 a total of 21 times .
Among their charting singles , they achieved Top 10 three times , Top 20 three times and Top 40 eight times .
They have sold over 20 million records worldwide .
Until his death in 2011 , early member Rob Grill and a newer lineup of the Grass Roots continued to play many live performances each year .
Since 2012 , band members chosen by Grill are carrying on the legacy of the group with nationwide live performances .
THE FOUNDING YEARS Section::::The founding years .
The name " Grass Roots " ( originally spelled as one word " Grassroots " ) originated in mid-1965 as the name of a band project by the Los Angeles songwriter and producer duo of P.F. Sloan and Steve Barri .
Sloan and Barri had written several songs in an attempt by their record company , Dunhill Records ( owned by Lou Adler ) , to cash in on the budding folk rock movement .
One of these songs was "
Where Were You When I Needed You , " which was recorded by Sloan and Barri .
Sloan provided the lead vocals and played guitar , Larry Knechtel played keyboards , Joe Osborn played the bass and Bones Howe was on drums .
The song was released under " The Grass Roots " name and sent , as a demo , to several radio stations of the San Francisco Bay area .
When moderate interest in this new band arose , Sloan and Barri went to look for a group that could incorporate the Grass Roots name .
They found one , The Bedouins , in a San Francisco band that won a Battle of the Bands at a Teenage Fair in San Mateo , California .
A new version of " Where Were You When I Needed You " with that band 's lead vocalist , Willie Fulton ( later , an early member of Tower of Power ) was recorded .
In late 1965 , the Grass Roots got their first official airplay on Southern California radio stations , such as KGB ( AM ) in San Diego and KHJ in Los Angeles , with a version of the Bob Dylan song " Mr. Jones ( Ballad of a Thin Man ) " .
Dylan granted Sloan the opportunity to cover the song after Sloan showed appreciation for his first listen to Dylan 's demo acetate of the song .
For some months , the group appeared as the first " real " Grass Roots .
They were utilized by Dunhill to back up The Mamas & the Papas and Barry McGuire and became a house band at The Trip nightclub in Hollywood .
The partnership with Sloan and Barri broke up when the band demanded more space for their own more blues rock - oriented material ( which Dunhill was not willing to give them ) .
Willie Fulton ( lead vocals , guitar ) , Denny Ellis ( guitar , backing vocals ) , and David Stensen ( bass , backing vocals ) went back to San Francisco , with drummer Joel Larson being the only one who remained in Los Angeles ( he later returned to the group in 1971 ) .
Fulton , Ellis and Stensen continued to appear as the Grass Roots , with original Bedouins drummer Bill Shoppe , until Dunhill ordered them to cease since they decided to start all over again with another group they would groom to be the Grass Roots .
In the meantime , the second version of " Where Were You When I Needed You " peaked in the Top 40 in mid-1966 , while an album of the same name sold poorly .
Still looking for a group to record their material and promote it with live dates , in 1966 Sloan and Barri offered Wisconsin - based band The Robbs ( for whom they produced some early material ) a chance to assume the identity of the Grass Roots , but the group declined .
THE YEARS OF SUCCESS Section::::The years of success .
The group 's third – and by far most successful – incarnation was finally found in a Los Angeles band called The 13th Floor ( not to be confused with the 13th Floor Elevators ) .
This band consisted of Creed Bratton ( vocals , guitar ) , Rick Coonce ( drums , percussion ) , Warren Entner ( vocals , guitar , keyboards ) , and Kenny Fukomoto ( vocals , bass ) and had formed only a year earlier .
Entner , who had been attending film school at UCLA alongside future Doors members Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek , was drifting through Europe in the summer of 1965 singing and playing on street corners , when he met fellow busker and American Creed Bratton in Israel , where an Israeli businessman expressed interest in managing and promoting them .
But the duo moved on individually and ended up back in LA by 1966 , where they formed the 13th Floor and submitted a demo tape to Dunhill Records .
After Fukomoto was suddenly drafted into the army , the group went through two replacements before finding singer / bassist Rob Grill .
In 1967 the band was offered the choice to go with their own name or choose to adopt a name that had already been heard of nationwide .
In the beginning , they were one of many U.S. guitar pop / rock bands , but with the help of Barri and their other producers , they developed a unique sound for which they drew as heavily on British beat as on soul music , rhythm and blues and folk rock .
Many of their recordings featured a brass section , which was a novelty in those days among American rock bands , with groups like Chicago just developing .
The bulk of the band 's material continued to be written by Dunhill Records staff ( not only Sloan and Barri ) and the LA studio - musicians who were part of what became known as the Wrecking Crew played the music on most , if not all , of their hits .
The Grass Roots also recorded songs written by the group 's musicians , which appeared on their albums and the B - sides of many hit singles .
As the Grass Roots , they had their first Top 10 hit in the summer of 1967 with " Let 's Live for Today " , an English - language cover version of " Piangi con me " , a 1966 hit for the Anglo - Italian quartet The Rokes .
" Let 's Live for Today " sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc .
With Rob Grill as lead singer , they recorded a third version of " Where Were You When I Needed You .
"
The band continued in a similar hit - making vein for the next five years ( 1967–1972 ) .
The Grass Roots played at the Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival on Sunday , June 11 , 1967 , in the " Summer of Love " as " Let 's Live for Today " was at # 15 and climbing .
This music festival occurred just days before the Monterey Pop Festival but did not have a movie to document it ( see List of electronic music festivals ) .
In late 1967 , the band recorded the album Feelings , which featured much heavier input in the songwriting and playing by the group members themselves .
But its failure to sell prompted Barri to take full hold of the reins again as he began to move the band in a more R&B , horn punctuated , direction .
By this time , Sloan had phased out of his involvement with the band and relocated to New York City to pursue a solo career .
On Sunday , October 27 , 1968 , the Grass Roots played at the San Francisco Pop Festival as their hit " Midnight Confessions " ( their first record to feature horns , and with Carol Kaye playing the opening bass - line )
was peaking at # 5 , and then played at the Los Angeles Pop Festival and Miami Pop Festival in December 1968 .
Creed Bratton became frustrated by Dunhill 's refusal to allow the band to write its own songs and play the instruments on its records ( although the members did play alone at concerts ) .
After a disastrous appearance at the Fillmore West in April 1969 , a " slightly inebriated " Bratton was asked to leave the band .
He was replaced by Dennis Provisor on keyboards and vocals , and lead guitarist Terry Furlong ( 1969–1971 ) was also brought in to form a quintet .
This was the first of many line - up changes for this version of the band .
The Grass Roots , with their new members , played at Newport Pop Festival 1969 at Devonshire Downs , which was a racetrack at the time but now is part of the North Campus for California State University , Northridge .
The group played on Sunday June 22 , 1969 , a week before their hit
" I 'd Wait A Million Years " reached the Hot 100 .
In Canada they played at the Vancouver Pop Festival at the Paradise Valley Resort in British Columbia in August 1969 ( see List of electronic music festivals ) .
By 1971 Furlong had stopped touring with the group to pursue a solo career but would continue to contribute on the records during the rest of their time on Dunhill .
His touring replacement was Brian Naughton , who left in 1972 .
Drummer Rick Coonce was gone as well by the beginning of 1972 and new members Joe Pollard ( drums , percussion ) and another guitarist named Terry ( last name unknown ) joined up .
Terry was soon replaced by Reed Kailing ( vocals , guitars ) .
However , drummer Pollard and keyboardist Dennis Provisor left soon after to go out as a duo ( although Provisor was featured on the band 's 1972 Move Along album ) and were replaced by a returning Rick Coonce and keyboard man Virgil Weber ( ex - Hamilton , Joe Frank and Reynolds and Climax ) .
Coonce was back for only a short period before he was gone again , turning the drum throne over to original member Joel Larson .
Singers Rob Grill and Warren Entner remained the point of focus during these years .
The group 's songs during 1967–1972 include : " Let 's Live for Today " , a cover of an Italian hit by The Rokes , " Piangi con me " ( U.S. # 8) and " Things I Should Have Said " ( U.S. # 23 )
( 1967 ) ; " Midnight Confessions " ( U.S. # 5 , their biggest hit ) ( 1968 ) ; " Bella Linda " ( a cover of an Italian hit by Lucio Battisti , " Balla Linda " ) ( U.S. # 28 ) , " Lovin' Things " ( a cover of a UK hit by Marmalade the previous year ) ( U.S. # 49 ) , "
The River Is Wide " ( U.S. # 31 ) ,
" I 'd Wait a Million Years " ( U.S. # 15 ) , and " Heaven Knows " ( U.S. # 24 ) ( 1969 ) ; " Walking Through the Country " ( U.S. # 44 ) , and " Baby Hold On " ( U.S. # 35 ) ( 1970 ) ; " Temptation Eyes " ( # 15 ) , "
Sooner or Later " ( U.S. # 9 ) , and " Two Divided by Love " ( U.S. # 16 ) ( 1971 ) ; " Glory Bound " ( U.S. # 34 ) and " The Runway " ( U.S. # 39 ) ( 1972 ) .
By early 1974 , the Grass Roots had left Dunhill ( now ABC Records ) and Kailing , Weber and longtime member Entner ( later a successful manager with groups such as Rage Against the Machine and Quiet Riot ) moved on , while former members Terry Furlong and Dennis Provisor returned to the fold .
Furlong left permanently by mid-1974 to be succeeded by Gene Barkin , then by Reggie Knighton .
The resulting group was Grill , Larson , Provisor and Knighton .
Dennis Lambert and Brian Potter , who had penned the group 's 1971 hit " Two Divided By Love " and many others , invited the band to join their Haven label , where they released an eponymous album in 1975 , The Grass Roots , containing the single " Mamacita " , which charted at # 71 on the Billboard Hot 100 .
Follow - up singles failed to chart .
TIMELINE
THE LATER YEARS 1976 TO 1981 Section::::The later years .
Section::::1976 to 1981 .
Their 1976 single "
Out In The Open " proved to be their swan song on Haven .
Knighton left in 1976 and Alan Deane took over , followed by guitarist Glen Shulfer in 1977 .
ABC Records issued a final greatest hits package of the group titled ABC Collection in 1976 .
But in late 1977 , Grill decided to take a break from performing and later recorded the 14 Greats album on Gusto Records featuring himself and Provisor .
This album consisted of 1978 rerecordings of their hits .
The group , still managed and booked by Grill ( who owned the group 's name ) , continued touring with Larson , Mark Miller ( lead vocals , guitar ) and Brian Carlyss ( bass , backing vocals ) , joined by Lonnie Price ( lead vocals , keyboards ) and Randy Ruff ( organ , backing vocals ) for touring dates and TV appearances until November 1978 .
Larson was then joined by new players Scott Hoyt ( lead vocals , guitars ) , David Nagy ( lead vocals , bass ) and Gene Wall ( keyboards ) .
Nagy and Larson left in 1979 and were replaced by a returning Carlyss and Reagan McKinley ( drums , percussion ) .
During this period , the group appeared on an HBO television special , " 60 's Rock Scrapbook " , filmed at Magic Mountain amusement park in Valencia , California in October 1979 , with Grill and Dennis Provisor making special appearances .
Grill launched a solo career in 1979 ( assisted on his solo album , Uprooted , by Lindsey Buckingham , Mick Fleetwood and John McVie of Fleetwood Mac on the song " Rock Sugar " ) .
Grill toured as a solo act in 1979–1980 opening for Fleetwood Mac 's Tusk Tour with a band led by guitarist Rick Alexander .
When interest in bands of the 1960s began to rise again in 1980 ,
Grill ( along with Provisor , Shulfer , and new players Steve Berndt ( bass ) and Luke Meurett ( drums ) took back the Grass Roots name and toured the United States and Japan .
The group 's 1981 roster included Grill , Provisor , Shulfer and a returning Coonce .
Also , drummer Larson and guitarist Miller were back to do more dates with the group in 1981 .
1982
TO 1993 Section::::1982 to 1993 .
In 1982 , Grill decided to go forward with a brand new lineup consisting of seasoned session players .
They were Terry Oubre ( guitars , backing vocals ) , Charles Judge ( keyboards , synthesizers , backing vocals ) and Ralph Gilmore ( drums , percussion , backing vocals ) .
Another keyboardist , Bob Luna , came in around mid-1982 to sub for Judge on dates when he was n't available .
That same year , the new band released Powers of the Night on MCA .
This would be the last album of new material to be released by the Grass Roots .
Later in 1982 , the Grass Roots performed an Independence Day concert on the National Mall in Washington , D.C. , attracting a large crowd and setting a record for attendance ( over half a million people ) , at that time , for an outdoor concert for a single musical act .
However , in April 1983 , James G. Watt , President Ronald Reagan 's Secretary of the Interior , banned Independence Day concerts on the Mall by such groups .
Watt said that " rock bands " that had performed on the Mall on Independence Day in 1981 and 1982 had encouraged drug use and alcoholism and had attracted " the wrong element " , who would mug people and families attending any similar events in the future .
During the ensuing uproar , Grill stated that he felt " highly insulted " by Watt 's remarks , which he called " nothing but un - American " .
After Powers failed to attract much attention , Grill and the group continued to tour into 1984 .
Dave Rodgers ( keyboards , backing vocals ) replaced Charles Judge and after Terry Oubre and Ralph Gilmore departed , Grill brought in two additional new players named George Spellman ( guitars , backing vocals ) and Coy Fuller ( drums , percussion ) and headed over to tour Europe in the summer of ' 84 .
According to Grill , there was also a country single , " St. Somewhere " , recorded in Nashville with this same lineup .
This single was never released .
By late 1984 , Grill had returned to the US and was touring with yet another new group of Grass Roots that included Dusty Hanvey ( guitars , backing vocals ) , Larry Nelson ( keyboards , synthesizers , backing vocals ) and David Page ( drums , percussion ) .
This lineup 's first show was in Okinawa .
From this point on , Grill and the group would concentrate on the " 60s nostalgia " circuit , starting with the Happy Together 85 Tour with fellow 1960s groups The Turtles , The Buckinghams and Gary Lewis & the Playboys .
In 1986 another package had them appearing with The Monkees , Gary Puckett , and Herman 's Hermits .
They were joined in this show by bassist Mark Clarke ( ex - Uriah Heep and Rainbow ) and a horn section , and backed up the Monkees and Gary Puckett during their sets as well .
Hanvey and Nelson continued backing the Monkees for their 1987 tour , while the Grass Roots joined Classic Superfest , which also featured Herman 's Hermits , Mark Lindsay , and Gene Clark 's Byrds .
For this tour , Mark Tamorsky handled guitar and Michael Lewis ( soon replaced by Robbie Barker ) was on keyboards .
Terry Danauer was also added on bass at this point .
But by October 1987 , Hanvey and Nelson were back with Grill and Joe Dougherty replaced David Page on drums in 1989 .
In 1991 Rhino Records released a double CD anthology of the group sparking renewed interest in the band .
Mike Stec came in for Danauer on bass in 1992–1993 before Grill took over bass again .
From hereon the band 's lineup was stable .
1994
TO 2011 Section::::1994 to 2011 .

They shared the stage with Johnny Rivers , Nancy Sinatra , the Robby Krieger Band and Drake Levin and Phil Volk of Paul Revere and the Raiders .
In 2000 Grill released a Grass Roots live concert album titled Live at Last , which was followed in 2001 by an album with a symphonic quartet titled Symphonic Hits .
During the 2000s , the group regulars had available substitutes ( former Outsiders singer Sonny Geraci sat in for Grill during the first half of 2002 , Scott Sechman filled in for Hanvey in 1998 , Chris Merrell filled in for Hanvey on various dates 2000–2006 , while Hal Ratliff came in for Nelson when he had other commitments from 2000 on ) .
In 2008 Grill released a second live concert album titled Live Gold and brought in Mark Dawson ( vocals , bass ) earlier that same year to fill in when he was absent .
During the summers of 2010 and 2011 , the Grass Roots had heavy touring schedules throughout the U.S. , both on their own and as part of the Happy Together :
25th Anniversary Tour , along with Flo & Eddie of The Turtles , Mark Lindsay , The Buckinghams , and Monkees member Micky Dolenz .
Grill continued to lead the band into the current millennium as the Grass Roots sole owner and made appearances with the band until his death .
Rick Coonce died of heart failure on February 25 , 2011 and Rob Grill died on July 11 , 2011 from complications following a stroke .
