LEXUS ES
The is a series of compact executive , then mid - size luxury / executive cars sold by Lexus , the luxury division of Toyota since 1989 .
Seven generations of the sedan have been introduced to date , each offering V6 engines and the front - engine , front - wheel - drive layout .
The first five generations of the ES were built on the Toyota Camry platform , with the sixth generation more closely related to the Avalon .
Manual transmissions were offered until 1993 , a lower - displacement inline - four engine became an option in Asian markets in 2010 , and a gasoline - electric hybrid version was introduced in 2012 .
The ES was Lexus ' only front - wheel drive vehicle until 1998 , when the related Lexus RX was introduced , and the sedan occupied the entry - level luxury car segment of the Lexus lineup in North America and other regions until the debut of the Lexus IS in 1999 .
The ES name stands for " Executive Sedan " .
However , some Lexus importers use the backronymic name , " Elegant Sedan " .
Introduced in 1989 , the first - generation ES 250 was one of two vehicles in Lexus ' debut lineup , the other being the flagship LS 400 .
The second - generation ES 300 debuted in 1991 , followed by the third - generation ES 300 in 1996 , and the fourth - generation ES 300/330 in 2001 .
The first- through fourth - generation sedans shared body styling elements with Japan - market Toyota sedans , and a domestic market equivalent , the Toyota Windom , was sold until the launch of the fifth - generation ES in 2006 .
The word " Windom " is a combination of " win " and the suffix " dom " expresses a state of perpetual victory .
The fifth - generation ES , featuring Lexus ' own L - finesse body styling , debuted in early 2006 as a 2007 model .
The sixth - generation ES debuted in the first half of 2012 as a 2013 model , and features increased cabin dimensions due to a longer wheelbase which is shared with the full - size Toyota Avalon .
Lexus has positioned the ES in the comfort luxury segment , with an emphasis on interior amenities , quietness , and ride quality , in contrast with more firm - riding sport sedans .
Buyers seeking more performance - focused models are targeted by the Lexus IS and rival makes , with such models offering a sportier drive with differently tuned suspensions .
In Europe , Japan , and other markets where it is not available , the GS sport sedans occupy the mid - size category in the Lexus lineup .
In the United States , the Lexus ES has been the best - selling Lexus sedan for over fifteen years .
FIRST GENERATION ( V20 ) 1989–1991 Section::::First generation ( V20 ) .
Section::::1989–1991 .
The first Lexus ES ( VZV21 ) debuted in January 1989 at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit as part of the launch of the Lexus division .
In order to avoid introducing the nameplate with only one model , the LS 400 , Lexus debuted the ES alongside their flagship sedan .
The smaller representative of the initial two - sedan Lexus lineup was designated the ES 250 , and powered by the Camry 's 2.5 L , V6 , which was aimed directly at the Acura Legend .
The ES 250 was based on the Toyota Camry Prominent / Vista ( V20 ) .
On the exterior , the ES 250 shared the same general body style and overall dimensions as its Toyota counterparts , but had a more prominent grille , bigger tail lights , chrome trim , frameless windows , and distinct wheel design similar to its LS brethren .
Inside the cabin , the ES 250 featured a six - speaker Pioneer sound system , genuine wood trim , one - touch power windows , and leather seats .
A four - speed automatic or five - speed manual transmission was offered .
The Electronically Controlled Automatic Transmission ( ECT ) featured " normal " and " power " modes .
Safety features included a driver 's SRS airbag and anti - lock brakes .
In typical specification , the ES 250 further included 15-inch alloy wheels , a power driver 's seat , power moonroof , and CD player .
Leather upholstery was common equipment , despite being listed as an option , while some ES 250s were also produced with cloth interiors .
In September 1989 , the ES 250 and the flagship LS 400 went on sale in the United States .
The ES 250 was marketed as the " luxury sedan of sports sedans , " and carried a U.S. market suggested base price of approximately $ 22,000 .
During the first month of release , the ES 250 logged 1,216 units in sales .
However , these numbers were eclipsed by the larger LS sedan , which unlike the ES was built on a unique and all - new platform .
The original LS had been envisioned as a standalone model , but Lexus dealerships had asked for an additional vehicle to accompany its launch .
Due to its similarities to the Camry , some viewed the ES 250 as a placeholder product of badge engineering and the vehicle ultimately did not sell as well as its larger counterpart .
Initial perception of the ES led some to believe all the development time and research spent creating the larger LS showed that they overlooked one of the reasons the LS was developed , which was the 1986 Acura Legend , so it seems that the appearance of the LS was shrunk to fit the ES so as to compete with the Legend .
Production totaled 19,534 units in 1990 and 17,942 units in 1991 , most for the automatic transmission model .
Production commenced in June 1989 at Tsutsumi , with the first 1990 ES 250 rolling off the production line on 30 August 1989 .
Production ended on 5 July 1991 .
Because of its relatively brief production run , the ES 250 is a rare model on US roads today .
SECOND GENERATION ( XV10 ) 1991–1994 Section::::Second generation ( XV10 ) . Section::::1991–1994 .
In September 1991 , for the 1992 model year , Lexus announced the second - generation Lexus ES ( XV10 ) almost one year after the introduction of the second - generation Acura Legend , but before Infiniti finally decided to add a similarly classed sedan , the J30 .
The second - generation ES shared its design with the new generation Toyota Windom ( XV10 ) , which was officially announced in Japan on 30 September 1991 , introduced at the October 1991 Tokyo Motor Show , and exclusive to Toyota Japan dealership sales channel called Toyota Corolla Store as the top level luxury sedan .
The Windom itself shared elements with the latest generation of the Japan - market Toyota Camry Prominent ( V30 ) .
Completely redesigned and now sharing design features with the XV10 series Toyota Windom and styling cues with the LS 400 , the model was renamed the ES 300 to reflect the half - liter increase in engine displacement to 3.0-liters .
The second - generation ES was significantly larger and more curvaceous than its predecessor , gaining in length and of width .
On the front fascia , the ES gained projector headlamps in a curved housing and a three - slat grille with the Lexus emblem moved above on the hood .
The side profile featured an invisible B - pillar and frameless - window doors .
The rear deck lid featured an integrated spoiler effect similar to the flagship LS 400 , improving the ES model 's aerodynamics , now rated .
Inside the cabin , the second - generation ES featured California walnut trim on the center console , leather seats , an eight - speaker premium sound system , and keyless entry .
The added wheelbase length and overall width made for increased legroom and shoulder space than the previous model .
Compared to its Camry relative , the ES 300 featured separate styling , a different suspension setup with front and rear independent MacPherson strut , and added weight amounting to .
Much of this is due to increased dimensions , asphalt insulation in the body panels and additional on - board equipment .
As with its predecessor , anti - lock brakes were standard .
The ES 300 sported a 3.0-liter 3VZ - FE V6 engine and had an advertised time of 7.9 seconds .

In its first full year of sales , the ES logged 39,652 units , and throughout the following years of its production run , sales reached near or above that figure .
Although the initial US base price was $ 26,550 , this increased to over $ 30,000 in later years .
By 1994 , in part because of the rising yen and high demand , the manufacturer 's suggested retail price had increased to $ 31,200 , 19.3 percent more than the original 1992 figure .
In 1993 , a passenger airbag was added as standard equipment .
