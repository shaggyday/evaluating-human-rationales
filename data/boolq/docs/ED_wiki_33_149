FIGGY PUDDING
Figgy pudding is a type of Christmas pudding which was originally made with figs .
It may be baked , steamed in the oven , boiled or fried .
Figgy pudding dates back to 16th century England .
Its possible ancestors include savoury puddings , such as crustades , fygeye or figge ( a potage of mashed figs thickened with bread ) , creme boiled ( a kind of stirred custard ) , and sippets ( croutons ) .
In any case , its methods and ingredients appear in diverse older recipes , for instance in Mrs Beeton 's Book of Household Management .
Today , the term figgy pudding is popularised mainly by the Christmas carol
" We Wish You A Merry Christmas , " which includes the line , "
Now bring us some figgy pudding " .
A variety of nineteenth - century sources state that , in the West Country of England ( from which the carol comes ) , " figgy pudding " referred to a raisin or plum pudding , not necessarily one containing figs .
