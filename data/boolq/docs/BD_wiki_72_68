Note : The Parsis in India use a Shahenshahi calendar , unlike the Iranians who use a Kadmi calendar .
The North American and European Parsis have adapted their own version of the Fasli calendar .
This is however looked down upon by many of the Parsis in North America , who continue to use the Shahenshai calendar .
These differences cause changes in the dates of the holidays .
For example , the Zoroastrian New Year falls in the spring for the Iranians but in the summer for the Parsis . !

While having so many government holidays is in line with the idea of peaceful co - existence of all religions , there have been demands from various public bodies that the system of a multitude of religious holidays is hampering economic activities to a great extent .
The past two Central Government Pay Commissions [ 1 ] have recommended the abolition of all Central Government holidays on religious festivals , and instead , substituting them with the three national holidays , i.e. , Independence Day ( 15 August ) , Republic Day ( 26 January ) and Gandhi Jayanti ( 2 October ) .
Increasing the number of restricted holidays ( optional holidays ) , depending on one 's religious persuasion , from the existing two to eight was also proposed , the rationale being that eight holidays can more than cater to the festivals of any particular religion .
So , there is no point in having more than that number of holidays since religion does not warrant a Hindu to celebrate Eid or a Muslim to celebrate Diwali .
With the proposed system , however , it was left to the individual to choose which eight holidays to celebrate , irrespective of his religious belief .
This recommendation has not been accepted by the government of India , fearing a loss of popularity , thus the Indian government continues with an unusually large number of religious holidays as compared to most other countries .
