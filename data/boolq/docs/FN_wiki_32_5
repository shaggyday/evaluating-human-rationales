BARE KING
In chess and chess variants , a bare king ( or lone king ) is a game position where one player has only the king remaining ( i.e. all the player 's other pieces have been ) .
HISTORICAL Section::::Historical .
In some old versions of chess , for example " Baring chess " , as well as the game of shatranj , leaving the opponent with a bare king was one way of winning the game ( see Checkmate#History ) .
The relative weakness of the pieces in shatranj may have made this form of a win desirable .
A possible exception to the bare king rule was if the king immediately after being bared was able to recapture , leaving the opponent with a bare king as well .
This situation , called a " Medinese victory " , was often considered a draw .
CONTEMPORARY Section::::Contemporary .
Under modern rules , a player with a bare king does not automatically lose and may continue playing .
A bare king can never give check , however , and can therefore never deliver a checkmate or win the game .
A bare king can in some situations play to a draw , such as by stalemate or if the opponent of a bare king oversteps the time limit .
If both players are left with a bare king , the game is immediately drawn .
Similarly , if one player has only a king and bishop or knight while the opponent has a bare king , the game is immediately drawn .
A quote attributed to Mikhail Tal claims that a game in the 1959 Zurich tournament between Bobby Fischer and Gideon Barcza finished with bare kings , but this is not supported by the published score of the game in chess books and databases .
