FASHION CAPITAL
A fashion capital is a city which has a major influence on international fashion trends and in which the design , production and retailing of fashion products – plus events such as fashion weeks , awards and trade fairs – generate significant economic output .
The cities considered the global " Big Four " fashion capitals of the 21st century are Milan , London , New York and Paris .
DEFINITION OF A FASHION CAPITAL Section::::Definition of a fashion capital .
A fashion capital assumes leadership role in clothing and design .
In addition , fashion capitals usually have a broad mix of business , artistic , entertainment , cultural and leisure activities and are internationally recognised for having a unique and strong identity .
It has also been noted that the status of a fashion capital has become increasingly linked to a city 's domestic and international profile .
Fashion capitals are also likely be part of a wider design scene , with design schools , fashion magazines and a local market of affluent consumers .
Since the 16th century , Milan has been regarded as the Fashion Capital of the World .
Nowadays , often the term fashion capital is used to describe the cities that hold fashion weeks , most prominently Milan , Paris , London and New York , to showcase their industry .
Also various other cities host notable fashion events and are influential in global fashion .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Historically , several cities have been , in turn , fashion capitals .
During the Renaissance era , different city - states in what would become modern - day Italy were Europe 's main trendsetters , due to the cultural power they exerted in that period of time ; this includes cities such as Florence , Milan , Rome , Naples , Genoa , and Venice .
Progressing into the late-16th century , with influence of the English Royal Court , London became a major city in European fashion .
Similarly , due to the power of Spain at the period , the Spanish court started to influence fashion , making it a major centre .
In the 17th century , as the Renaissance started to fade away , with the power of the French court under Louis XIV , Paris established itself as Europe 's main fashion centre .
During the 19th century , with the powerful British Empire and a young Queen Victoria on the throne ( from 1837 ) , London once again became a major fashion leader .
However , it continued to look to Paris for stylistic inspiration , and the British ' father of haute couture ' Charles Frederick Worth relocated to Paris in 1846 to perfect and then commercialise his craft , also holding the first fashion shows and launching the concept of fashion labels there .
20TH CENTURY AND BEYOND Section::::20th century and beyond .
During the Golden Twenties , Berlin was considered the vanguard fashion capital .
Throughout the 20th century – but particularly after World War II – New York City rose in stature as a fashion capital , challenging the dominance of Paris with a different approach , especially in its development and popularisation of sportswear as fashion during the 1940s and ' 50s .
During the 1950s Italy rose in prominence again .
Florence re - emerged as a leading city in fashion , although focus shifted to Milan from the 1970s on as leading design houses moved to the city .
In the 1980s , Tokyo claimed its place as a fashion capital with a new generation of avant - garde designers , including Issey Miyake or Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garçons gaining worldwide attention , even if the fashion show were all in Paris .
The fashion was radically different in both its use of textiles and in the way designers cut and draped .
More recently , new fashion hubs have emerged worldwide , and the old order has faced challenges from all corners of the globe , including Africa , Australasia and South America .
Since 2007 , Berlin has again been highlighted as an increasingly important centre for global fashion trends .
A 2011 issue of Fashion Theory : Journal of Dress , Body and Culture explored the move away from the traditional dominance of five key cities ( London , Milan , New York , Paris , Tokyo ) , with co - editor Lise Skov suggesting what she described as a " poly - centric " fashion industry developing in the 21st century .
