NFC EAST
The NFC East is a division of the National Football League ( NFL ) 's National Football Conference ( NFC ) .
It currently has four members : the Philadelphia Eagles , the New York Giants , the Dallas Cowboys , and the Washington Redskins .
The division was formed in 1967 as the National Football League Capitol Division , keeping with the theme of having all of the league 's divisions starting with the letter " C.
" The division was so named because it was centered on the capital of the United States , Washington ,
D.C. In 1967 and 1969 the teams in the NFL Capitol Division were Dallas , Philadelphia , Washington and the expansion team New Orleans Saints , which had been replaced by the New York Giants for the 1968 season .
As of 2018 , the NFC East is the only division in the league in which all four current teams have at least one Super Bowl win .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Previously , although the St. Louis Rams were geographically farther east than Dallas before moving back to Los Angeles , the Cowboys remained in the NFC East despite being the only team located in the Central Time Zone and the Rams stayed in the NFC West because of long - standing rivalries : the Cowboys with all three other teams in the East , and the Rams with the San Francisco 49ers in the West .
The NFC East teams have combined to be the most successful division in the NFL since the 1970 NFL merger with 21 NFC Championship wins and 13 Super Bowl victories , the highest marks of any division in the NFL .
The division features a number of prominent rivalries such as the Cowboys – Redskins rivalry and Eagles – Giants rivalry .
Because the division 's teams are in some of the United States ' largest media markets ( New York No . 1 , Philadelphia , No . 4 , Dallas - Fort Worth No . 5 , and Washington No . 6 ) , the NFC East receives a high amount of coverage from national sports media outlets .
In the early 1990s the division claimed four consecutive Super Bowl champions , all 4 against the Buffalo Bills , with the Giants and Redskins respectively winning back - to - back in Super Bowls XXV and XXVI ; and the Cowboys winning twice after in Super Bowls XXVII and XXVIII .
Those same three teams won seven out of ten Super Bowls , from 1986 - 87 to 1995 - 96 ( the 49ers won the other three during that span ) .
The Philadelphia Eagles are the only NFC East team to actually play in the city of the team 's naming , Philadelphia .
The other three teams play in suburbs of the major cities they are named after .
The Dallas Cowboys play in Arlington , Texas .
The Washington Redskins play in Landover , Maryland and the New York Giants play in East Rutherford , New Jersey , where they share a stadium with the New York Jets .
Somewhat analogously , all four teams in the AFC East do not play within the boundaries of their metro areas ' main cities .
The NFC East can also be called the most valuable NFL division .
All four teams in the division are in the top ten of most valuable NFL franchises ( Cowboys # 1 ; Giants # 3 ; Redskins # 4 ; Eagles # 10 ) .
The next closest division is the AFC North , which is not completed until the 26th ranked Cincinnati Bengals .
