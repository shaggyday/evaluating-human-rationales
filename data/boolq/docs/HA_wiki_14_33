UNLISTED PUBLIC COMPANY
An unlisted public company is a public company that is not listed on any stock exchange .
Though the criteria vary somewhat between jurisdictions , a public company is a company that is registered as such and generally has a minimum share capital and a minimum number of shareholders .
Each stock exchange has its own listing requirements which a company ( or other entity ) wishing to be listed must meet .
Besides not qualifying to be listed , a public company may choose not to be listed on a stock exchange for a number of reasons , including because it is too small to qualify for a stock exchange listing , does not seek public investors , or there are too few shareholders for a listing .
There is a cost to the listed entities , in the listing process and ongoing costs as well as in compliance costs such as the maintenance of a company register .
Unlisted public companies are more likely to engage in profit - maximising behavior as their share capital structure makes it very easy to give their members financial returns .
In Australia , a public company , whether listed or not , is required to prepare an annual report that includes a directors ' report , financial report , and an auditor 's report .
The report is to be distributed to shareholders 21 days before an annual general meeting or four months after the end of the financial year .
These rules are in place because members of the public who have invested in such companies are not always in a position to get information about the companies performance , and so would not be able to monitor their investment and determine the return on their investment .
