The New York Times praised it as " surprising and moving " and wrote that " one need n't be suffering like Aza to identify with it .
One need only be human .
"
Many reviewers noted Green 's talent for keen observation , sharpened more in this case by Green 's own struggles with OCD , the mental illness depicted in the novel .
Several reviewers referenced a dismissive perception of Green 's now very popular oeuvre as " sad teen books " , which emerged since the popularity of The Fault in Our Stars , but praised Turtles All the Way Down as truthful and authentic enough to transcend these imagined drawbacks .
" It often dwells in clich√© , but only as pop songs and epic poems do , mining the universal to create something that speaks to the familiar rhythms of the heart , " wrote Matt Haig of The Guardian , " It might just be a new modern classic .
