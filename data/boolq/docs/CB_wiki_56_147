COUVADE SYNDROME Couvade syndrome , also called sympathetic pregnancy , is a proposed condition in which a partner experiences some of the same symptoms and behavior as an expectant mother .
These most often include minor weight gain , altered hormone levels , morning nausea , and disturbed sleep patterns .
In more extreme cases , symptoms can include labor pains , fatigue , postpartum depression , and nosebleeds .
The labor pain symptom is commonly known as sympathy pain .
Couvade syndrome is not recognized as a real syndrome by many medical professionals .
Its source is a matter of debate .
Some believe it to be a psychosomatic condition , while others believe it may have biological causes relating to hormone changes .

PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORIES
Section::::Psychological theories .
Psychological causes suggested have included anxiety , pseudo - sibling rivalry , identification with the fetus , ambivalence about fatherhood , or parturition envy .
According to Osvlosky and Culp ( 1989 ) , pregnancy causes the male counterpart to experience an emergence of ambivalence as well as a recurrence of Oedipal conflict .
In 1920s France , Couvade was claimed to be more common in conditions where sex roles are flexible and the female is of a dominant status .
