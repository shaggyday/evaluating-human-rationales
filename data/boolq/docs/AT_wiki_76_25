FICTIONAL
CHARACTER
BIOGRAPHY
Section::::Fictional character biography .
Dr. Henry Jekyll feels he is battling between the good and bad within himself , thus leading to the struggle with his alter ego , Edward Hyde .
He spends his life trying to repress evil urges that are not fitting for a man of his stature .
He develops a serum in an attempt to mask this hidden evil .
However , in doing so , Jekyll transforms into Hyde , a hideous creature without compassion or remorse .
Jekyll has a friendly personality , but as Hyde , he becomes mysterious and violent .
As time goes by , Hyde grows in power and eventually manifests whenever Jekyll shows signs of physical or moral weakness , no longer needing the serum to be released .
Stevenson never says exactly what Hyde does on his nightly forays , generally saying that it is something of an evil and lustful nature .
Thus , in the context of the times , it is abhorrent to Victorian religious morality .
Hyde may have been reveling in activities such as engaging with prostitutes or burglary .
However , it is Hyde 's violent activities that seem to give him the most thrills , driving him to attack and murder Sir Danvers Carew without apparent reason , making him a hunted outlaw throughout England .
A lawyer named Gabriel Utterson and Jekyll 's butler , Mr. Poole , end up breaking into Jekyll 's lab .
Inside , they find the body of Hyde wearing Jekyll 's clothes and apparently dead from suicide .
They find also a letter from Jekyll to Utterson promising to explain the entire mystery .
Utterson takes the document home where he first reads Lanyon 's letter and then Jekyll 's .
The first reveals that Lanyon 's deterioration and eventual death resulted from the shock of seeing Hyde drinking a serum or potion and as a result of doing so , turning into Jekyll .
The second letter explains that Jekyll , having previously indulged unstated vices ( and with it the fear that discovery would lead to his losing his social position ) found a way to transform himself and thereby indulge his vices without fear of detection .
But Jekyll 's transformed personality , Hyde , was effectively a sociopath â€” evil , self - indulgent , and utterly uncaring to anyone but himself .
Initially , Jekyll was able to control the transformations , but eventually he would become Hyde involuntarily in his sleep .
At this point , Jekyll resolved to cease becoming Hyde .
One night , however , the urge gripped him too strongly , and after the transformation he immediately rushed out and violently killed Carew .
Horrified , Jekyll tried more adamantly to stop the transformations , and for a time he proved successful by engaging in philanthropic work .
One day , at a park , he considered how good a person that he had become as a result of his deeds ( in comparison to others ) , believing himself redeemed .
However , before he completed his line of thought , he looked down at his hands and realized that he had suddenly transformed once again into Hyde .
This was the first time that an involuntary metamorphosis had happened in waking hours .
Far from his laboratory and hunted by the police as a murderer , Hyde needed help to avoid being caught .
He wrote to Lanyon ( in Jekyll 's hand ) , asking his friend to retrieve the contents of a cabinet in his laboratory and to meet him at midnight at Lanyon 's home in Cavendish Square .
In Lanyon 's presence , Hyde mixed the potion and transformed back to Jekyll .
The shock of the sight instigated Lanyon 's deterioration and death .
Meanwhile , Jekyll returned to his home only to find himself ever more helpless and trapped as the transformations increased in frequency and necessitated even larger doses of potion in order to reverse them .
It was the onset of one of these spontaneous metamorphoses that caused Jekyll to slam his laboratory window shut in the middle of his conversation with Enfield and Utterson .
Eventually , the stock of ingredients from which Jekyll had been preparing the potion ran low , and subsequent batches prepared by Dr. Jekyll from renewed stocks failed to produce the transformation .
Jekyll speculated that the one essential ingredient that made the original potion work ( a salt ) must have itself been contaminated .
After sending Poole to one chemist after another to purchase the salt that was running low only to find it would n't work , he assumed that subsequent supplies all lacked the essential ingredient that made the potion successful for his experiments .
His ability to change back from Hyde into Jekyll had slowly vanished in consequence .
Jekyll wrote that even as he composed his letter , he knew that he would soon become Hyde permanently , having used the last of this salt and he wondered if Hyde would face execution for his crimes or choose to kill himself .
Jekyll noted that , in either case , the end of his letter marked the end of his life .
He ended the letter saying , " I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end " .
With these words , both the document and the novella come to a close .
The original pronunciation of Jekyll was " Jeekul " , which was the pronunciation used in Stevenson 's native Scotland .
This is also the pronunciation of Gertrude Jekyll .

The film The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen ( adapted from the comic book series ) features Jason Flemyng as both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde ( the latter using prosthetic makeup ) .
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are employed by The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen to combat the ruthless criminal known as the Fantom , who is revealed in the course of the film to be " M " , the man who recruited them , and also Professor Moriarty , who intends to acquire the power of the League for use in his plans to trigger a world war and sell his weapons for profit .
His mole in the League , Dorian Gray , manages to acquire a sample of the Hyde serum , which he is able to duplicate , one of Moriarty 's men drinking a massive overdose of the Hyde serum to become an even larger version of Hyde .
Despite the other Hyde 's size and raw power , he is defeated when he burns through the formula at an accelerated rate , resulting in Moriarty 's fortress collapsing on top of him .
* Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde appear in Van Helsing , with Dr. Jekyll portrayed by Stephen Fisher while Robbie Coltrane provides the voice of the CGI animated Mr. Hyde .
Like the version that was seen in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen , Mr. Hyde is also portrayed as a large , hulking brute .
Van Helsing has pursued Hyde to Paris , France after having failed to capture him in an earlier confrontation in London , England .
He is superhumanly strong and displays agility comparable to that of a great ape .
While not invulnerable , he 's extremely tough and sustains severe injuries that ultimately do little to impede or slow him down to any appreciable degree .
Upon exchanging banter , they begin fighting in the bell tower of Notre Dame Cathedral with Van Helsing initially gaining the advantage by severing Hyde 's left arm at the biceps , which regresses to a normal form after landing on the floor .
Hyde rallies and assaults Van Helsing , using his right arm to hurl him through the roof of the cathedral .
He then gloats before tossing Van Helsing off the roof only for Van Helsing to fire a grappling gun that sends the hook & line through the center of Hyde 's body , which Van Helsing uses to stop his fall .
He attempts to pull Hyde off the roof , only for Hyde to begin pulling him upward , seemingly unfazed by the large hole in his body .
Hyde trips over the edge of the roof , his falling weight pulling Van Helsing up to the roof before the line breaks .
As it breaks , the momentum swings Hyde through the Rose Window of the cathedral and , while he falls , Hyde transforms back into the form of Henry Jekyll and dies from the fall .
A police officer spots Van Helsing on top of the cathedral and holds him accountable for Dr. Jekyll 's death .
The novelization of the film portrays Hyde as not only a murderer , but a cannibal as well .
The novel says the body of the murdered woman Van Helsing discovers on the streets of Paris as partially devoured while the same scene in the film shows the woman 's body intact .
However , the film does suggest that Hyde is cannibalistic when he encounters Van Helsing in Notre Dame and tells him " You 're a big one .
You 'll be hard to digest . "
* A creature that might be Mr. Hyde appears in Hotel Transylvania .
He is seen around the end of the movie , when everyone is singing " The Zing " .

Mask of the Blue Falcon , voiced by John DiMaggio .
* Russell Crowe played Dr. Jekyll in The Mummy , which is the first installment in Universal 's Dark Universe and is a role which will be elaborated on in further films within the series .
It is suggested that Jekyll 's transformation into Hyde was a ' natural ' condition , as he reflects on how someone- implied to be him- realized that he was succumbing to evil but was able to find a cure as a physician , requiring regular injections of an unspecified compound to prevent himself becoming Hyde , an aggressive and sadistic persona .
Despite the personality transformation , Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde have the same appearance , with the exception of their skins and eyes , although they also have a different palmprint with the result that palm scanners that will allow Jekyll access but will prohibit Hyde from using the door .
As Hyde , he exhibits greater levels of physical strength , endurance and aggression as well as improved combat abilities .
