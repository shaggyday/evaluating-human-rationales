FIELD GOAL ( BASKETBALL )
In basketball , a field goal is a basket scored on any shot or tap other than a free throw , worth two or three points depending on the distance of the attempt from the basket .
Uncommonly , a field goal can be worth other values such as one point in FIBA 3x3 basketball competitions or four points in the BIG3 basketball league .
" Field goal " is the official terminology used by the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) in their rule book , in their box scores and statistics , and in referees ' rulings .
The same term is also the official wording used by the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) and high school basketball .
Kareem Abdul - Jabbar holds the NBA record for field goals made in a career with 15,837 .
Wilt Chamberlain , one of the most prolific scorers of all time , holds the top four spots for most field goals made in a season and has the two top field goal percentages for a season .
One of the greatest field - goal shooters of all time is Michael Jordan , who led the NBA in field goals made ten times .
Shaquille O'Neal has the record for most seasons ( 10 ) with the best field goal percentage , and Artis Gilmore has the record for highest career field goal percentage ( 59.9 % ) .
Steve Nash was one of the greatest all - around shooters in the history of the NBA , holding the record for 50–40–90 seasons , a mark of all - around shooting for two - point field goals , three - point field goals , and free throws .

One type of field goal is called a slam dunk .
This occurs when a player jumps near the basket with possession of the ball , throwing the ball down through the basket while airborne .
The word " slam " is derived onomatopoeically from the sound of the player 's hands hitting , grabbing , then releasing the hoop .
