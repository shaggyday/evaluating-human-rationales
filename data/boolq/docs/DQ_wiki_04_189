CENTER OF CURVATURE
In geometry , the center of curvature of a curve is found at a point that is at a distance from the curve equal to the radius of curvature lying on the normal vector .
It is the point at infinity if the curvature is zero .
The osculating circle to the curve is centered at the centre of curvature .
Cauchy defined the center of curvature C as the intersection point of two infinitely close normal lines to the curve .
The locus of centers of curvature for each point on the curve comprise the evolute of the curve .
This term is generally used in Physics regarding to study of the lenses .
It can also be defined as the spherical distance between the point at which all the rays , falling on the lens either seems to converge to it ( in case of Convex Lens ) or diverge from it ( in case of Concave Lens ) and the lens itself .
