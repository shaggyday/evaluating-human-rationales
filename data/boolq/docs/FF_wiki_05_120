CONSCRIPTION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM Conscription in the United Kingdom has existed for two periods in modern times .
The first was from 1916 to 1920 , the second from 1939 to 1960 , with the last conscripted soldiers leaving the service in 1963 .
Known as Military Service from 1916 to 1920 , the system of conscription from 1939 to 1960 was called National Service , but between 1939 and 1948 , it was often referred to as " war service " in documents relating to National Insurance and pension provision .
FIRST WORLD
WAR Section::::First World War .
Conscription during the First World War began when the British government passed the Military Service Act in January 1916 .
The act specified that single men aged 18 to 40 years old were liable to be called up for military service unless they were widowed with children or ministers of a religion .
There was a system of Military Service Tribunals to adjudicate upon claims for exemption upon the grounds of performing civilian work of national importance , domestic hardship , health , and conscientious objection .
The law went through several changes before the war ended .
Married men were exempt in the original Act , although this was changed in June 1916 .
The age limit was also eventually raised to 51 years old .
Recognition of work of national importance also diminished , and in the last year of the war there was some support for the conscription of clergy .
Conscription lasted until mid-1919 .
Due to the political situation in Ireland , conscription was never applied there ; only in England , Scotland and Wales .
SECOND WORLD
WAR Section::::Second World War .
Conscription legislation lapsed in 1920 .
However , as a result of the deteriorating international situation and the rise of Nazi Germany , Leslie Hore - Belisha , Secretary of State for War , persuaded the cabinet of Neville Chamberlain to introduce a limited form of conscription on 27 April 1939 , with the Military Training Act being passed the following month .
Only single men 20 to 22 years old were liable to be called up , and they were to be known as " militiamen " to distinguish them from the regular army .
To emphasise this distinction , each man was issued with a suit in addition to a uniform .
The intention was for the first intake to undergo six months of basic training before being discharged into an active reserve .
They would then be recalled for short training periods and attend an annual camp .
At the outbreak of war , on 3 September 1939 , the Military Training Act was overtaken by the National Service ( Armed Forces ) Act , and the first intake was absorbed into the army .
This act imposed a liability to conscription of all men 18 to 41 years old .
Men could be rejected for medical reasons , and those engaged in vital industries or occupations were " reserved " at a particular age beyond which no one in that job would be enlisted .
For example , lighthouse keepers were " reserved " at 18 years old .
From 1943 , some conscripts were directed into the British coal mining industry and become known as the " Bevin Boys " .
Provision was also made for conscientious objectors , who were required to justify their position to a tribunal , with power to allocate the applicant to one of three categories : unconditional exemption ; exemption conditional upon performing specified civilian work ( frequently farming , forestry or menial hospital work ) ; exemption from only combatant service , meaning that the objector had to serve in the specially created Non - Combatant Corps or in some other non - combatant unit such as the Royal Army Medical Corps .
By 1942 all male British subjects between 18 and 51 years old and all females 20 to 30 years old resident in Britain were liable to be called up , with some exemptions : * British subjects from outside Britain and the Isle of Man who had lived in the country for less than two years
* Police , medical and prison workers * Northern Ireland
* Students * Persons employed by the government of any country of the British Empire except the United Kingdom
* Clergy of any denomination * Those who were blind or had mental disorders
* Married women * Women who had one or more children 14 years old or younger living with them .
This included their own children , legitimate or illegitimate , stepchildren , and adopted children , as long as the child was adopted before 18 December 1941 .
Pregnant women were not exempted , but in practice were not called up .
Men under 20 years old were initially not liable to be sent overseas , but this exemption was lifted by 1942 .
People called up before they were 51 years old but who reached their 51st birthday during their service were liable to serve until the end of the war .
People who had retired , resigned or been dismissed from the forces before the war were liable to be called back if they had not reached 51 years of age .
Britain did not completely demobilise in 1945 , as conscription continued after the war .
Those already in the armed forces were given a release class determined by length of service and age .
In practice , releases began in June 1945 , and the last of the wartime conscripts had been released by 1949 .
However , urgently needed men , particularly those in the building trades , were released in 1945 , although some restrictions on their immediate employment were supposed to be enforced .
All women were released at the end of the war .
AFTER 1945 Section::::After 1945 .
National Service as peacetime conscription was formulated by the National Service Act 1948 .
From 1 January 1949 , healthy males 17 to 21 years old were expected to serve in the armed forces for 18 months , and remain on the reserve list for four years .
They could be recalled to their units for up to 20 days for no more than three occasions during these four years .
Men were exempt from National Service if they worked in one of the three " essential services " : coal mining , farming and the merchant navy for a period of eight years .
If they quit early , they were subject to being called up .
Exemption continued for conscientious objectors , with the same tribunal system and categories .
In October 1950 , in response to the British involvement in the Korean War , the service period was extended to two years ; in compensation , the reserve period was reduced by six months .
National Servicemen who showed promise could be commissioned as officers .
National Service personnel were used in combat operations , including the Malayan Emergency , the Cyprus Emergency , in Kenya against the Mau Mau Uprising , and the Korean War , where conscripts to the Gloucestershire Regiment took part in the last stand during the Battle of the Imjin River .
In addition , National Servicemen served in the Suez Crisis in 1956 .
During the 1950s there was a prohibition on serving members of the armed forces standing for election to parliament .
A few National Servicemen stood for election in the 1951 and 1955 general elections in order to be dismissed from service .
National Service ended gradually from 1957 .
It was decided that those born on or after 1 October 1939 would not be required , but conscription continued for those born earlier whose call - up had been delayed for any reason .
In November 1960 the last men entered service , as call - ups formally ended on 31 December 1960 , and the last National Servicemen left the armed forces in May 1963 .
BRITISH OVERSEAS TERRITORIES Section::::British Overseas Territories .
Currently , the British overseas territory of Bermuda practises conscription .
Recruitment into the part - time military reserves in Bermuda ( from 1895 ; service in the old Bermuda Militia , as in that in England and Wales , had been compulsory for all able - bodied , military - aged males ) had originally followed the practices in England for the militia , in which soldiers voluntarily enlisted for six years , and in the later Volunteer Force , in which part - time soldiers served voluntarily and could quit their service with 14 days ' notice , except while embodied for training , war , or national emergency .
The Militia , Volunteer force , and Yeomanry were merged into the Territorial Force ( later renamed the Territorial Army ) in Britain in 1907 , with the introduction of terms of service ( specific lengths of service for which volunteers enlisted ) , but this did not occur in Bermuda until the 1920s .
Conscription into the Bermuda Militia Artillery and the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps was discussed during the First World War , but had not been put into place before the cessation of hostilities .
It was introduced during the Second World War , with conscripts serving full - time for the duration in the BMA , BVRC , the Bermuda Volunteer Engineers , or the Bermuda Militia Infantry .
Those unable to serve full - time were directed into the Bermuda Home Guard .
Although conscription ended with the war , a shortfall of volunteers led to its reintroduction to the BVRC in 1957 and the BMA in 1960 .
Since the two units were amalgamated in 1965 , conscription has been retained , making the Bermuda Regiment the only conscripted force still serving under the British Crown .
Conscription is for three years of part - time service , with the terms of service otherwise identical to those which originally applied to Territorial soldiers in Britain ( with a basic service requirement of one drill night per week , one weekend camp per month , and one two - week annual camp per year , not including embodiment for active service .
Service is for home defence purposes , and soldiers can not be compelled to serve in overseas campaigns ) .

In 2015 Prince Harry made a call for bringing back conscription .
