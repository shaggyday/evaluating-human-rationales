ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE
VIP AIRCRAFT
The Royal Australian Air Force has operated a number of specialised aircraft to transport the Queen of Australia , other members of the Royal Family , the Governor General of Australia , senior members of the Australian government , and other dignitaries .
The RAAF 's current VIP aircraft are two leased Boeing Business Jets and three Bombardier Challengers which are operated by No . 34 Squadron RAAF and are based at Canberra Airport .
The Boeing Business Jets are custom configured Boeing 737 - 700s fitted with facilities such as conference tables , offices suites , secure satellite and communication capabilities .
The two planes have a longer range than is standard for Boeing Business Jets .
The Prime Minister regularly makes use of the aircraft for domestic and international travel .
Prior to the acquisition of the 737s , passenger - configured RAAF Boeing 707s tanker - transports were used .
These aircraft were larger than the 737s currently in use .
In August 2014 , Defence Minister David Johnston announced the intention to convert a KC-30A to VIP configuration .
