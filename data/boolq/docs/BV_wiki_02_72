ENDOMYSIUM
The endomysium , meaning within the muscle , is a wispy layer of areolar connective tissue that ensheaths each individual myocyte ( muscle fiber , or muscle cell ) .
It also contains capillaries and nerves .
It overlies the muscle fiber 's cell membrane : the sarcolemma .
Endomysium is the deepest and smallest component of muscle connective tissue .
This thin layer helps provide an appropriate chemical environment for the exchange of calcium , sodium , and potassium , which is essential for the excitation and subsequent contraction of a muscle fiber .
Endomysium combines with perimysium and epimysium to create the collagen fibers of tendons , providing the tissue connection between muscles and bones by indirect attachment .
The elastic fiber of collagen is the major protein that composes connective tissues like endomysium .
Endomysium has been shown to contain mainly type I and type III collagen components , and type IV and type V in very minor amounts .
The term cardiac skeleton is sometimes considered synonymous with endomysium in the heart , but cardiac skeleton also refers to the combination of the endomysium and perimysium .
Anti - endomysial antibodies ( EMA ) are present in celiac disease .
They do not cause any direct symptoms to muscles , but detection of EMA is useful in the diagnosis of the disease .
