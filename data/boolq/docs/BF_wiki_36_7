POWERBALL Powerball is an American lottery game offered by 44 states , the District of Columbia , Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands .
It is coordinated by the Multi - State Lottery Association ( MUSL ) , a nonprofit organization formed by an agreement with US lotteries .
Powerball 's minimum advertised jackpot is $ 40 million ( annuity ) ; Powerball 's annuity is paid in 30 graduated installments or winners may choose a lump sum payment instead .
One lump sum payment will be less than the total of the 30 annual payments because of the time value of money .
Drawings for Powerball are held every Wednesday and Saturday evening at 10:59p.m .
Eastern Time .
Since October 7 , 2015 , the game has used a 5/69 ( white balls )
+ 1/26 ( Powerballs ) matrix from which winning numbers are chosen , resulting in odds of 1 in 292,201,338 of winning a jackpot per play .
Each play costs $ 2 , or $ 3 with the Power Play option .
( Originally , Powerball plays cost $ 1 ; when PowerPlay began , such games were $ 2 . )
The official cutoff for ticket sales is 10:00p.m .
Eastern Time ; some lotteries cut off sales earlier .
The drawings are usually held at the Florida Lottery 's studio in Tallahassee .
On January 13 , 2016 , Powerball produced the largest lottery jackpot in history ; the $ 1.586 billion jackpot was split by three tickets sold in Chino Hills , California , in Munford , Tennessee , and in Melbourne Beach , Florida .

In 2013 , Wyoming became the 44th state to establish a lottery ; the next year , it began , initially offering both Mega Millions and Powerball . HISTORY 1988 PRECURSOR : LOTTO AMERICA Section::::History .
Section::::1988
precursor :
Lotto America .
Powerball 's predecessor began in 1988 ; the multi - state game was known as Lotto America .
The game , and name , were changed to Powerball on April 19 , 1992 ; its first drawing was held April 22 .
POWERBALL BEGINS Section::::Powerball begins .
When it was launched in 1992 Powerball became the first game to use two drums .
Using two drums to draw numbers from offers more manipulation by simultaneously allowing high jackpot odds , numerous prize levels and low overall odds of winning ( as explained later , a ticket can win by matching only one number ) .
The two - drum concept was suggested by Steve Caputo of the Oregon Lottery .
The two - drum concept has since been used by The Big Game ( now Mega Millions ) in the US , Australia 's Powerball , Thunderball in the UK , Eurojackpot and EuroMillions ( unlike most two - drum games , Euromillions selects two numbers called " Lucky Stars " from the 2nd drum ; jackpot winners must make a total of seven matches ) .
Through 2008 , Powerball drawings usually were held at Screenscape Studios in West Des Moines , Iowa .
The drawings ' host was longtime Iowa radio personality Mike Pace , who had hosted MUSL drawings since Lotto America began in 1988 .
In 1996 , Powerball went " on the road " for the first time , holding five remote drawings at the Summer Olympics in Atlanta .
A few weeks later , Georgia became the only jurisdiction to leave Powerball ( Maine , which joined MUSL in 1990 , left when Powerball began ) .
In August 1996 , Georgia joined the then - new The Big Game , then the other major U.S. lottery group .
It planned to sell tickets for both games for the rest of 1996 ; but within days Georgia was removed from MUSL , not to return until the 2010 cross - sell expansion .
On November 2 , 1997 , the annuity was changed from 20 to 25 yearly payments ; the cash option was added .
The annuity comprises 30 graduated payments , increasing 5 % annually .
In 1998 , Florida was given permission by its government to participate in a multi - state game .
It was set to offer Powerball ; but in early 1999 , new governor Jeb Bush prevented Florida from joining since he believed Powerball would hurt the existing Florida Lottery games .
In 2008 , Governor Charlie Crist finally allowed Florida to join MUSL , on Jan 4 , 2009 .
On March 7 , 2001 , an optional multiplier ( called Power Play ) was added , allowing players to multiply non - jackpot winnings by up to five by paying an extra $ 1 per game .
A wheel was introduced to select the Power Play multiplier for each drawing ( the next year , the 1x was removed from the Power Play wheel . )
2009
: FLORIDA BECAME HOST TO DRAWINGS
Section::::2009 : Florida became host to drawings .
With the start of Powerball sales in Florida on January 4 , 2009 ( with its first drawing on January 7 ) , the matrices changed to 5/59 + 1/39 ( adding four white ball numbers and dropping three red balls ) .
This changed the jackpot probability from 1:146 million to 1:195 million ; the overall probability became 1:35 .
Based on statistical projections , the average jackpot win increased from $ 95 million to $ 141 million .
Over 3.5 million additional prizes were expected to be won yearly due to the change in probability .
The starting jackpot increased to $ 20 million , with minimum rollovers of $ 5 million .
The jackpot contribution increased from 30.3 % to 32.5 % of total sales .
The Power Play option was modified ; second prize , usually $ 200,000 , was given an automatic 5x multiplier , making the 5 + 0 prize $ 1 million cash .
The bonus second prize if the jackpot exceeded its previous record by $ 25 million , triggered only twice , was eliminated with the 2012 format change .
The conditions for Florida joining Powerball included a move of the live drawings from Iowa to Universal Studios in Orlando .
The three hosts rotating announcing duties from Universal Studios were Tracy Wiu , Elizabeth Hart and Scott Adams
( MUSL headquarters remained in Iowa , where its other draws are held ) .
The wheel that was used to determine the Power Play multiplier was retired when the drawings moved to Florida ; a random number generator ( RNG ) was used until the 2012 format change .
Arkansas became the 33rd MUSL member on October 31 , 2009 , the last to join before the 2010 cross - sell expansion .
The Ohio Lottery added Powerball on April 16 , 2010 ; it joined Mega Millions ( along with New York ) years earlier , when The Big Game added Mega Millions to its name .
2010
CROSS - SELL
EXPANSION Section::::2010 cross - sell expansion .
In March 2009 , it was reported that New Jersey , already a Mega Millions member , sought permission to join Powerball .
Shortly after , discussions were revealed about allowing each US lottery to offer both games .
On Oct 13 , the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross - sell Mega Millions and Powerball .
In Nov , MUSL signed an agreement to start streaming Powerball drawings online .
On Jan 31 , 2010 , the date of the cross - sell expansion , Mega Millions and MUSL each added lotteries ; eight Powerball members added Mega Millions by May.
The Montana Lottery joined Mega Millions on March 1 .
Nebraska added Mega Millions on March 20 ; Oregon followed on March 28 ; Arizona joined Mega Millions on April 18 ; Maine added Mega Millions on May 9 ; Colorado and South Dakota joined Mega Millions on May 16 .
The U.S. Virgin Islands joined Mega Millions in Oct 2010 .
Before the agreement , the only places that sold both Mega Millions and Powerball tickets were retailers straddling a border ; one retailer on the Sharon , Pennsylvania / Masury , Ohio border sold both Mega Millions ( via the Ohio Lottery ) and Powerball ( Pennsylvania ) before the agreement and continued to be the only retailer to sell tickets for both lotteries .
Illinois joining Powerball on the expansion date , it became the second multi - jurisdictional lottery game ( after Mega Millions , which Illinois already participated in ) whose drawings were carried nationally .
Both games ' drawings were simulcast via Chicago cable superstation WGN - TV through its national WGN America feed .
WGN - TV aired Illinois Lottery drawings nationally from 1992 to 2015 after acquiring broadcast rights from Chicago 's Fox owned - and - operated station WFLD in 1988 , which took the rights from WGN - TV in 1987 .
Powerball drawings were aired on WGN - TV and WGN America on Wednesday and Saturday immediately following the station 's 9 pm ( Central Time ) newscast with the Mega Millions drawings being aired Tue and Fri evenings after the newscast .
WGN served as a default carrier of Mega Millions or Powerball where no local television station carries either multi - jurisdictional lottery 's drawings .
On March 13 , 2010 , New Jersey became the first previous Mega Millions - only member ( just before the cross - selling expansion ) to produce a jackpot - winning Powerball ticket .
It was worth over $ 211 million in annuity payments ; it was sold in Morris Plains .
On May 28 , 2010 , North Carolina became the first previous MUSL member ( just before the cross - selling expansion ) to produce a jackpot - winning Mega Millions ticket ; that jackpot was $ 12 million ( annuity ) .
On June 2 , 2010 , Ohio won a Powerball jackpot ; it became the first lottery selling either Mega Millions or Powerball ( when 2010 began ) to provide a jackpot - winning ticket for its newer game .
The ticket was worth a $ 261 million annuity ; it was sold in Sunbury .
Ohio 's second Powerball jackpot - winning ticket , sold for the June 23 , 2010 drawing , was part of another first ; since Montana also provided a jackpot winner for that drawing , it was the first time a jackpot was shared through lotteries which sold competing games before the cross - selling expansion , as Montana sold only Powerball before the expansion date .
2012 FORMAT CHANGE Section::::2012 format change .
On January 15 , 2012 , the price of each basic Powerball play doubled to $ 2 , while PowerPlay games became $ 3 ; the minimum jackpot doubled to $ 40 million .
A non - jackpot play matching the five white balls won $ 1 million .
The red balls decreased from 39 to 35 .
The drawings were moved from Universal Studios Orlando to the Florida Lottery 's studios in Tallahassee .
Sam Arlen served as host , with Alexa Fuentes substituting .
These changes were made to increase the frequency of nine - figure jackpots ; a Powerball spokesperson believed a $ 500 million jackpot was feasible
( it became a reality within the year , ) and that the 1st $ 1 billion jackpot in US history would occur by 2012
Less than three months after the Powerball changes , Mega Millions ' jackpot reached $ 656,000,000 despite remaining a $ 1-per - play game .
The random Power Play multiplier was retired for a set , fixed dollar amount payout .
The $ 25 million rollover " cap " ( creating larger 5 + 0 prizes ) was eliminated .
California joined on April 8 , 2013 ; it has never offered the Power Play option , as all payouts in California Lottery drawing games , by law , are parimutuel .
Mega Millions , which became available in California in 2005 , offers its Megaplier in its other 45 jurisdictions .
On January 22 , 2014 , the variable Power Play option returned ( 2x-5x ) for multiplying non - jackpot prizes .
In October 2014 , Puerto Rico joined Powerball ; the first mainly Spanish - speaking jurisdiction offering the game ; as of 2016 it had not joined Mega Millions .
2015
FORMAT CHANGE Section::::2015 format change .
On Oct 4 , 2015 , the Powerball format changed again ; the white - ball pool increased from 59 to 69 while the Powerball pool decreased from 35 to 26 .
While this improved the chance of winning any prize to 1 in 24 , it also lengthened the jackpot odds to 1 in 292,201,338 .
The 4 + 1 prize became $ 50,000 ; the 10x PowerPlay became available in drawings with a jackpot of under $ 150 million .
Three months later , the format produced a $ 1.5 billion jackpot , double the previous record , after 20 consecutive rollovers .
PLAYING THE GAME BASIC GAME Section::::Playing the game .
Section::::Basic game .
The minimum Powerball bet is $ 2 .
In each game , players select five numbers from a set of 69 white balls and one number from 26 red Powerballs ; the red ball number can be the same as one of the white balls .
The drawing order of the five white balls is irrelevant ; all tickets show the white ball numbers in ascending order .
Players can not use the drawn Powerball to match two of their white numbers , or vice versa .
Players can select their own numbers , or have the terminal pseudorandomly select the numbers ( called " quick pick " , " easy pick " , etc . ) .
In each drawing , winning numbers are selected using two ball machines : one containing the white balls and the other containing the red Powerballs .
Five white balls are drawn from the first machine and the red ball from the second machine .
Games matching at least three white balls or the red Powerball win .
Two identical machines are used for each drawing , randomly selected from four sets .
The model of machine used is the Halogen , manufactured by Smartplay International of Edgewater Park , New Jersey .
There are eight ball sets ( four of each color ) ; one set of each color is randomly selected before a drawing .
The balls are mixed by a turntable at the bottom of the machine that propels the balls around the chamber .
When the machine selects a ball , the turntable slows to catch it , sends it up the shaft , and then down the rail to the display .

Play was introduced in 2001 .
‡10× available if jackpot is under $ 150 million .
While Mega Millions and Powerball each have similar jackpot odds despite having a different double matrix ( Mega Millions is 5/75 + 1/15 ) , since Powerball is $ 2 per play , it now takes $ 584,402,676 ( not counting Power Play side bets ) on average to produce a jackpot - winning ticket .
POWER PLAY Section::::Power Play .
For an additional $ 1 per game , a player may activate the Power Play option .
Activating it multiplies lower - tier winnings ( base prize $ 50,000 or less ) by up to 5 , or 10 when the jackpot is under $ 150 million .
Power Play is drawn separate from the 6 numbers .
The 5 + 0 prize is automatically doubled to $ 2 million if Power Play is activated .
The dilemma for players is whether to maximize the chance at the jackpot or increase lower - tier winnings .
If a player selects a fixed amount of money to spend on tickets at a certain time , the player will give up one guess of the winning set of numbers every two times this player activates Power Play in respect of one of the purchased tickets .
Power Play , when it began in 2001 , was drawn with a special wheel .
In 2006 and 2007 , MUSL replaced one of the 5× spaces on the Power Play wheel with a 10×. During each month - long promotion , MUSL guaranteed that there would be at least one drawing with a 10× multiplier .
The promotion returned in 2008 ; the ball landed in the 10× space twice .
After being absent in 2009 , the 10× multiplier returned in May 2010 ( after the Power Play drawing was changed to RNG . )
The promotion was extended for the only time , as the 10× multiplier was not drawn until June 12 .
The second prize 5× guarantee continued ; the 10× applied to all non - jackpot prizes , as in previous promotions .
Power Play′s success has led to similar multipliers in other games , most notably Megaplier , available through all Mega Millions members except California .
The 2012 Powerball changes resulted in all eight lower - tier levels having " fixed " Power Play prizes .
On Jan 19 , 2014 , PowerPlay was modified ; it used 30 balls with the following distribution :
* 2x ( 15 ) * 3x ( 9 ) * 4x/5x : 3
each On Oct 4 , 2015 , PowerPlay changed again , using 42 or 43† balls as follows : * 2x ( 24 ) * 3x ( 13 ) * 4x ( 3 ) * 5x ( 2 ) * 10x ( 1)† † 10x available when jackpot is under $ 150 million .

§ Odds of winning 0
+ 1 prize are 1:38.32 instead of 1:26 as there is the possibility of also matching at least one white ball .
All non - jackpot prizes are fixed amounts ( except in California ) ; they may be reduced and paid on a parimutuel basis , with each member paying differing amounts for the same prize tier , if the liability exceeds the funds in the prize pool for any game member .
JACKPOT ACCUMULATION AND PAYMENT OPTIONS Section::::Jackpot accumulation and payment options .
Jackpot winners have the option of receiving their prize in cash ( in two installments ; one from the winning jurisdiction , then the combined funds from the other members ) or as a graduated annuity paid in 30 yearly installments .
Each annuity payment is 5 % higher than in the previous year to adjust for inflation .
The advertised estimated jackpot represents the total payments that would be paid to jackpot winner(s ) should they accept the annuity option .
This estimate is based on the funds accumulated in the jackpot pool rolled over from prior drawings , expected sales for the next drawing , and market interest rates for the securities that would be used to fund the annuity .
The estimated jackpot usually is 32.5 % of the ( non - Power Play ) revenue of each base ( $ 1 ) play , submitted by game members to accumulate into a prize pool to fund the jackpot .
If the jackpot is not won in a particular drawing , the prize pool carries over to the next drawing , accumulating until there is a jackpot winner .
This prize pool is the cash that is paid to a jackpot winner if they choose cash .
If the winner chooses the annuity , current market rates are used to calculate the graduated payment schedule and the initial installment is paid .
The remaining funds in the prize pool are invested to generate the income required to fund the remaining installments .
If there are multiple jackpot winners for a drawing , the jackpot prize pool is divided equally for all such plays .
MUSL and its members accept all investment risk and are contractually obligated and liable to the winner to make all scheduled payments to annuity winners .
If a jackpot ticket is not claimed , the funds in the prize pool are returned to members in proportion to the amount they contributed to the prize pool .
The members have different rules regulating how unclaimed funds are used .
When the Powerball jackpot is won , the next jackpot is guaranteed to be $ 40 million ( annuity ) .
If a jackpot is not won , the minimum rollover is $ 10 million .
The cash in the jackpot pool is guaranteed to be the current value of the annuity .
If revenue from ticket sales falls below expectations , game members must contribute additional funds to the jackpot pool to cover the shortage ; the most likely scenario where this can occur is if the jackpot is won in consecutive drawings .
CLAIMING PRIZES
Section::::Claiming prizes .
A winning ticket must be claimed in the jurisdiction in which it was purchased , regardless of residence .
The minimum age to play Powerball is 18 , except in Nebraska ( 19 ) ; and Arizona , Iowa , and Louisiana ( 21 ) .
Generally , Powerball players do not have to choose cash or annuity unless they win a jackpot ( then they usually have 60 days to choose . )
Exceptions include Florida and Missouri ; the 60-day " clock " starts with the drawing , so a jackpot winner who wishes to take the cash option needs to make immediate plans to claim their prize .
New Jersey and Texas require the cash / annuity choice to be made when playing ; in New Jersey , an annuity ticket can be changed to cash after winning , while in Texas , the choice is binding ( when the cash option was introduced in 1997 , all Powerball players had to make the choice when playing .
This regulation was phased out by 1999 . )
All Powerball prizes must be claimed within a period ranging from 90 days to a year , depending on where the ticket was bought .
Powerball winnings in California and Pennsylvania are subject to Federal income tax only .
There is no state income tax in Florida , South Dakota , Texas , Washington and Wyoming , and only on interest and dividends in Tennessee and New Hampshire .
Winnings from tickets purchased outside of one 's home state may be subject to the income tax laws of both states ( with possible credit based on the two jurisdictions . )
SECONDARY PRIZES Section::::Secondary prizes .
Unlike the jackpot pool , other prizes are the responsibility and liability of each participating lottery .
All revenue for Powerball ticket sales not used for jackpots is retained by each member ; none of this revenue is shared with other lotteries .
Members are liable only for the payment of secondary prizes sold there .
Since the secondary prizes are defined in fixed amounts ( except in California ) , if the liability for a given prize level exceed the funds in the prize pool for that level the amount of the prize may be reduced and the prize pool be distributed on a parimutuel basis and result in a prize lower than the fixed amounts given in the prize tables .
Because the secondary prize pools are calculated independently , it is possible lower - tier prizes will differ among the game members .
NOTABLE WINS Section::::Notable wins .
Because the quoted jackpot amount is an annuity of 30 graduated annual payments , its cash value relative to the annuity fluctuates .
The actual ratio depends on projected interest rates and other factors .
MUSL starts with the cash value , built from a percentage of sales , and then calculates the advertised jackpot amount from that value , based on the average costs of the three best securities bids .
On August 23 , 2017 , the owner of a Powerball ticket sold in Chicopee , Massachusetts won more than $ 750 million , one of the largest prizes in the lottery 's history .
On January 13 , 2016 , the world 's largest lottery jackpot , an annuity of approximately $ 1.586 billion , was split among three Powerball tickets in Chino Hills , California , Melbourne Beach , Florida and Munford , Tennessee , each worth $ 528.8 million .
Since there is no income tax in Florida or Tennessee ( and California does not tax lottery winnings ) , the cash option after Federal withholdings is $ 187.2 million each .
On May 18 , 2013 , the world 's largest one - ticket jackpot , an annuity of approximately $ 590.5 million ( $ million today ) , was won by a Powerball ticket sold in Zephyrhills , Florida .
On June 5 , Florida Lottery officials announced the winner : Gloria C. MacKenzie , 84 , who purchased the " quick pick " ticket at a Publix supermarket .
MacKenzie chose the cash option of approximately $ 370.8 million , before Federal withholding ; Florida does not have a state income tax .
Other winners in excess of $ 250 million :
On December 25 , 2002 , Jack Whittaker , president of a construction firm in Putnam County , West Virginia , won $ 314.9 million ( $ million today ) , then a new record for a single ticket in an American lottery .
Whittaker chose the cash option of $ 170 million , receiving approximately $ 83 million after West Virginia and Federal withholdings .
On October 19 , 2005 , the West family of Jacksonville , Oregon won $ 340 million ( $ million today ) .
The Wests chose the cash payout of $ 164.4 million ( before withholdings ) , smaller than Whittaker 's cash payout in 2002 due to a then - recent change in the annuity structure .
A jackpot of $ 365 million ( $ million today ) was won on February 18 , 2006 by one ticket in Nebraska .
It was shared by eight people who worked at a meatpacking plant .
The group chose the cash option of approximately $ 177.3 million , before withholdings .
On August 25 , 2007 , a jackpot worth $ 314 million ( $ million today ) was won by a retired auto worker from Ohio ; that ticket was bought in Richmond , Indiana , a community that had previously sold a jackpot - winning ticket of over $ 200 million .
In November 2011 , three Greenwich , Connecticut , financial executives shared a jackpot of $ 254.2 million ( $ million today ) , the largest prize on a Connecticut - bought ticket .
Choosing the cash option , the men split nearly $ 104 million after withholdings .
The jackpot , at the time , was the 12th largest in Powerball history .
FORTUNE COOKIE PAYOUT Section::::Fortune cookie payout .
The Powerball drawing on March 30 , 2005 , produced 110 second - prize winners .
The total payout to these winners was $ 19.4 million , with 89 winners receiving $ 100,000 each , while the other 21 winners received $ 500,000 each as they were Power Play selections .
MUSL officials initially suspected fraud or a reporting error .
However , all 110 winners had played numbers from fortune cookies made by Wonton Food Inc. of Long Island City , New York .
The factory had printed the numbers " 22 , 28 , 32 , 33 , 39 , 40 " on thousands of fortunes .
The " 40 " in the fortune did not match the Powerball number , 42 .
None of the employees of Wonton Food played those numbers ; at the time , the closest game member was Connecticut .
Since the ticket holders had won as result of a coincidence rather than foul play , the payouts were made .
Had the fortune cookie given 42 as the Powerball number , these winners would have shared the $ 25 million jackpot : each $ 227,272 annuity or $ 122,727 cash ( before withholdings ) .
The fortune on the cookie read : " All the preparation you 've done will finally be paying off . "
COMPUTERS AND SLOT MACHINES Section::::Computers and slot machines .
In 2006 , WMS Gaming released a range of slot machines under the Powerball brand name .
In 2007 , the Oregon Lottery released a Windows Sidebar gadget that displays the winning numbers for Powerball in real - time .
The gadget also provides large jackpot announcements .
The New York Lottery introduced a Powerball scratchcard in 2010 .
Five winning numbers plus a powerball were printed across the top of the card , with 12 opportunities to match .
Matching the winning numbers or the powerball won .
The top prize was $ 1 million ( annuity ) ; unlike actual Powerball , there was no cash option for the top prize .
