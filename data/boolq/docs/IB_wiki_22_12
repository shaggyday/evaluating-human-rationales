TIME IN SPAIN
Spain has two time zones and observes daylight saving time .
Spain mainly uses Central European Time ( GMT+01:00 ) and Central European Summer Time ( GMT+02:00 ) in Peninsular Spain , the Balearic Islands , Ceuta , Melilla and plazas de soberanía .
In the Canary Islands , the time zone is Western European Time ( GMT±00:00 ) and Western European Summer Time ( GMT+01:00 ) .
Daylight saving time is observed from the last Sunday in March ( 01:00 GMT ) to the last Sunday in October ( 01:00 GMT ) throughout Spain .
Spain used Greenwich Mean Time ( UTC±00:00 ) before the Second World War ( except for the Canary Islands which used GMT−01:00 before this date ) .
However , the time zone was changed to Central European Time in 1940 and has remained so since then , meaning that Spain does not use its " natural " time zone under the coordinated time zone system .
Some observers believe that this time zone shift plays a role in the country 's relatively unusual daily schedule ( late meals and sleep times ) .
HISTORY STANDARD TIME ADOPTION Section::::History .
Section::::Standard time adoption .
Spain , like other parts of the world , used mean solar time until 31 December 1900 .
In San Sebastián on 22 July 1900 , the president of the Consejo de Ministros , Mr. Francisco Silvela , proposed to the regent of Spain , María Cristina , a royal decree to standardise the time in Spain ; thus setting Greenwich Mean Time ( UTC±00:00 ) as the standard time in peninsular Spain , the Balearic Islands and Ceuta and Melilla from 1 January 1901 onwards .
The royal decree was sanctioned by María Cristina on 26 July 1900 in San Sebastián , the place where she resided during summer .
THE CANARY ISLANDS EXCEPTION Section::::The Canary Islands exception .
Before 1 March 1922 , the Canary Islands still used mean solar time until it was discovered that the royal decree of 1900 applied only to the Peninsula and Balearic Islands .
The Canary Islands then used a time 1 hour behind the rest of Spain ; GMT−01:00 , until 16 March 1940 , and since then , they have used Western European Time ( GMT±00:00 ) .
Canary Islands observes daylight saving time at the same time ( 01:00 GMT )
the rest of Spain does , that is , changing from 01:00 WET to 02:00 Western European Summer Time on the last Sunday in March ( while the rest of Spain changes from 02:00 Central European Time to 03:00 Central European Summer Time )
and , when daylight saving time ends , changing from 02:00 Western European Summer Time to 01:00 Western European Time on the last Sunday in October ( while the rest of Spain changes from 03:00 Central European Summer Time to 02:00 CET ) .
It is very popular in Spanish national media , mainly on the radio , to list the notice ′una hora menos en Canarias′
( English : ′one hour less in the Canary Islands′ ) when the local time is mentioned .
The natural time zone for the Canary Islands is GMT−01:00 .
DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME
Section::::Daylight saving time .
Daylight saving time ( DST ) was first introduced in 1918 , the year in which World War I ended .
It was then introduced and abolished several times .
It was not applied in 1920–1923 , 1925 , 1930 nor during the Second Spanish Republic period in 1931–1936 .
During the Spanish Civil War , DST was re - established , but there were different dates of application , depending on if the territory was under the control of the Republican faction or Nationalist faction .
Curiously , the Republican faction made its first attempt to change from Greenwich Mean Time to Central European Time when time was advanced 1 hour on 2 April 1938 and advanced another hour on 30 April 1938 , only adjusting back 1 hour on 2 October 1938 .
After the war ended on 1 April 1939 , Greenwich Mean Time was re - established and on 15 April 1939 DST was also applied .
Since 1974 , after the 1973 oil crisis , daylight saving time has been observed every year .
In 1981 it was applied as a directive and is revised every 4 years , DST is observed from the last Sunday in March ( 01:00 GMT ) to the last Sunday in September ( 01:00 GMT ) .
In 1996 , daylight saving time was harmonised throughout the European Union by Directive 2000/84 / EC , which moved the end of DST to the last Sunday in October .
CENTRAL EUROPEAN TIME Section::::Central European Time .
In 1940 , Francisco Franco changed the time zone by changing 16 March 1940 23:00
Greenwich Mean Time to 17 March 1940 00:00
Central European Time during World War II .
This was made permanent in 1942 in order to be in line with German occupied Europe .
Several western European countries , including France , Belgium , and the Netherlands stayed on German time after the war in addition to Spain .
CRITICISM OF THE USE OF CENTRAL EUROPEAN TIME Section::::Criticism of the use of Central European Time .
According to the original 24-hour division of the world , the nearest mean solar time zone is Greenwich Mean Time for all of mainland Spain except the westernmost part ( about three - quarters of Galicia ) , which corresponds with the GMT-01:00 time zone .
However , all of mainland Spain has used Central European Time ( GMT+01:00 ) since 1940 .
At the time it was considered a temporary wartime decision which would be revoked a few years later , which eventually did not happen .
Some activists believe that the mismatch between Spain 's clock time and solar time contributes to the country 's unusual daily schedule .
They believe that the relatively late sunrises and sunsets shift the average Spaniard 's day later than it otherwise would be , and that a return to its original time zone would help boost productivity and bring family and work rhythms into better balance .
In September 2013 the subcommittee to study the Rationalisation of Hours , the Reconciliation of Personal , Family Life and Professional Life and Responsibility ( subcomisión para el estudio de la Racionalización de Horarios , la Conciliación de la Vida Personal , Familiar y Laboral y la Corresponsabilidad ) of the Congress of Deputies made a report to the government of Spain proposing , among other things , a return to Greenwich Mean Time .
The subcommittee considered that this time zone change would have a favourable effect , allowing more time for family , training , personal life , leisure , and avoiding downtime during the workday .
The proposals are aimed at improving Spanish labour productivity as well as better adjusting schedules to family and work life .
The Spanish government will consider the proposal .
THE GALICIA PROBLEM Section::::The Galicia problem .
In Galicia , the westernmost region of mainland Spain , the difference between the official local time and the mean solar time is about two and a half hours during summer time .
There have been political pushes to change the official time so that , as in Portugal , it is one hour in advance of the zone standard time .
This would involve switching to GMT and making the time similar to that in Portugal , with which it shares the same longitude .
For example , in Vigo ( located 35 time minutes west of Greenwich )
during summer , it is noon at around 14:40 and sunset is around 22:15 local time , while in Menorca sunset is around 21:20 .

Notes NOTATION DIFFERENCES WITH NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES Section::::Differences with neighbouring countries .
Spain has borders with four countries : Portugal , France , Andorra , and Morocco ; as well as with the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar .
Clocks must normally be set one hour earlier than in Spain after crossing the borders with Portugal .
