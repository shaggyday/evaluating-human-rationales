BLIGHTED OVUM
A blighted ovum or anembryonic gestation ( anembryonic pregnancy ) is a pregnancy in which the embryo never develops or develops and is reabsorbed .
It typically results in a miscarriage .
In a normal pregnancy , an embryo would be visible on an ultrasound by six weeks after the woman 's last menstrual period .
Anembryonic gestation is one of the causes of miscarriage of a pregnancy .
A blighted ovum or anembryonic gestation is characterized by a normal - appearing gestational sac , but the absence of an embryo .
It likely occurs as a result of early embryonic death with continued development of the trophoblast .
When small , the sac can not be distinguished from the early normal pregnancy , as there may be a yolk sac , though a fetal pole is not seen .
For diagnosis , the sac must be of sufficient size that the absence of normal embryonic elements is established .
The criteria depends on the type of ultrasound exam performed .
A pregnancy is anembryonic if a transvaginal ultrasound reveals a sac with a mean gestational sac diameter ( MGD ) greater than 25 mm and no yolk sac , or an MGD > 25 mm with no embryo .
Transabdominal imaging without transvaginal scanning may be sufficient for diagnosing early pregnancy failure when an embryo whose crown â€“ rump length is 15 mm or more has no visible cardiac activity .
