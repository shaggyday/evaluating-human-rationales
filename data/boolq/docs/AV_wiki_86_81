BANK OF SCOTLAND
The Bank of Scotland plc
( , ) is a commercial and clearing bank based in Edinburgh , Scotland .
With a history dating to the 17th century , it is the fifth - oldest surviving bank in the United Kingdom ( the Bank of England having been established one year earlier ) , and is the only commercial institution created by the Parliament of Scotland to remain in existence .
It was one of the first banks in Europe to print its own banknotes , and it continues to print its own sterling banknotes under legal arrangements that allow Scottish banks to issue currency .
In June 2006 , the HBOS Group Reorganisation Act 2006 was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom , allowing the bank 's structure to be simplified .
As a result , The Governor and Company of the Bank of Scotland became Bank of Scotland plc on 17 September 2007 .
Bank of Scotland has been a subsidiary of Lloyds Banking Group since 19 January 2009 , when HBOS was acquired by Lloyds TSB .
HISTORY ESTABLISHMENT Section::::History .
Section::::Establishment .
The Governor and Company of the Bank of Scotland was established by an Act of the Parliament of Scotland on 17 July 1695 , the Act for erecting a Bank in Scotland , opening for business in February 1696 .
Although established soon after the Bank of England ( 1694 ) , the Bank of Scotland was a very different institution .
Where the Bank of England was established specifically to finance defence spending by the English government , the Bank of Scotland was established by the Scottish government to support Scottish business , and was prohibited from lending to the government without parliamentary approval .
The founding Act granted the bank a monopoly on public banking in Scotland for 21 years , permitted the bank 's directors to raise a nominal capital of £ 1,200,000 pound Scots ( £ 100,000 pound sterling ) , gave the proprietors ( shareholders ) limited liability , and in the final clause ( repealed only in 1920 ) made all foreign - born proprietors naturalised Scotsmen " to all Intents and Purposes whatsoever " .
John Holland , an Englishman , was one of the bank 's founders .
Its first chief accountant was George Watson .
18TH AND 19TH CENTURIES Section::::18th and 19th centuries .
The Bank of Scotland was suspected of Jacobite sympathies .
Its first rival , The Royal Bank of Scotland was formed by royal charter in 1727 .
This led to a period of great competition between the two banks as they tried to drive each other out of business .
Although the " Bank Wars " ended in around 1751 , competition soon arose from other sources , as other Scottish banks were founded throughout the country .
In response , the Bank of Scotland itself began to open branches throughout Scotland .
The first branch in London opened in 1865 .
The bank also took the lead in establishing the security and stability of the entire Scottish banking system , which became more important after the collapse of the Ayr Bank in 1772 , in the crisis following the collapse of the London house of Neal , James , Fordyce and Down .
The Western Bank collapsed in 1857 , and the Bank of Scotland stepped in with the other Scottish banks to ensure that all the Western Bank 's notes were paid .
See Credit crisis of 1772 .
20TH CENTURY Section::::20th century .
In the 1950s , the Bank of Scotland was involved in several mergers and acquisitions with different banks .
In 1955 , the Bank merged with the Union Bank of Scotland .
The Bank also expanded into consumer credit with the purchase of Chester based , North West Securities ( now Capital Bank ) .
In 1971 , the Bank agreed to merge with the British Linen Bank , owned by Barclays Bank .
The merger saw Barclays Bank acquire a 35 % stake in the Bank of Scotland , a stake it retained until the 1990s .
The merchant banking division of the Bank of Scotland was relaunched as British Linen Bank ( now known as HBOS Treasury Services ) .
In 1959 Bank of Scotland became the first bank in the UK to install a computer to process accounts centrally .
At 11 am on 25 January 1985
the Bank introduced HOBS ( Home and Office Banking Services ) , an early application of remote access technology being made available to banking customers .
This followed a small - scale service operated jointly with the Nottingham Building Society for two years but developed by Bank of Scotland .
The new HOBS service enabled customers to access their accounts directly on a television screen , using the Prestel telephone network .
INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION
Section::::International expansion .
The arrival of North Sea oil to Scotland in the 1970s allowed the Bank of Scotland to expand into the energy sector .
The Bank later used this expertise in energy finance to expand internationally .
The first international office opened in Houston , Texas , followed by more in the United States , Moscow and Singapore .
In 1987 , the Bank acquired Countrywide Bank of New Zealand ( later sold to Lloyds TSB in 1998 ) .
The Bank later expanded into the Australian market by acquiring the Perth - based Bank of Western Australia .
A controversial period in the Bank 's history was the attempt in 1999 to enter the United States retail banking market via a joint venture with evangelist Pat Robertson .
The move was met with criticism from civil rights groups in the UK , owing to Robertson 's controversial views on homosexuality .
The Bank was forced to cancel the deal when Robertson described Scotland as a " dark land overrun by homosexuals " .
HBOS FORMATION OF HBOS
Section::::HBOS . Section::::Formation of HBOS .
In the late 1990s , the UK financial sector market underwent a period of consolidation on a large scale .
Many of the large building societies were demutualising and becoming banks in their own right or merging with existing banks .
For instance Lloyds Bank and TSB Bank merged in 1995 to create Lloyds TSB .
In 1999 , the Bank of Scotland made a takeover bid for National Westminster Bank .
Since the Bank of Scotland was significantly smaller than the English - based NatWest , the move was seen as an audacious and risky move .
However , The Royal Bank of Scotland tabled a rival offer , and a bitter takeover battle ensued , with the Royal Bank the victor .
The Bank of Scotland was now the centre of other merger opportunities .
A proposal to merge with the Abbey National was explored , but later rejected .
In 2001 , the Bank of Scotland and the Halifax agreed a merger to form HBOS ( " Halifax Bank of Scotland " ) .
The headquarters was to stay in Edinburgh , and both banks ' brands would continue to be used .
HBOS REORGANISATION ACT Section::::HBOS Reorganisation Act .
In 2006 , HBOS secured the passing of the HBOS Group Reorganisation Act 2006 , a private Act of Parliament that would allow the group to operate within a simplified structure .
The Act allowed HBOS to make the Governor and Company of the Bank of Scotland a public limited company , Bank of Scotland plc , which became the principal banking subsidiary of HBOS .
Halifax plc transferred its undertakings to Bank of Scotland plc , and although the brand name was retained , Halifax then began to operate under the latter company 's UK banking licence .
The provisions in the Act were implemented on 17 September 2007 .
LLOYDS BANKING GROUP Section::::Lloyds Banking Group .
In 2008 , HBOS Group agreed to be taken over by Lloyds TSB Group .
BANKNOTES Section::::Banknotes .
Although the Bank of Scotland today is not a central bank , it retains the right ( along with two other Scottish commercial banks ) to issue pound sterling banknotes to this day .
These notes are equal in value to notes issued by the Bank of England , the central bank of the United Kingdom .
BANKNOTE HISTORY
Section::::Banknote history .
Along with the Bank of England , the Bank of Scotland was one of the first European banks to issue paper currency redeemable for cash on demand ( which was an extremely useful facility given the poor state of the Scottish coinage at the end of the 17th century ) on a sustainable basis after the earlier failed attempt of the Swedish Stockholms Banco in 1661 - 64 .
Following the Acts of Union in 1707 , the bank supervised the reminting of the old Scottish coinage into Sterling .
The right to issue banknotes was extended to other banks after 1716 when the Bank of Scotland 's monopoly was allowed to lapse .
Up until the middle of the 19th century , privately owned banks in Great Britain and Ireland were permitted to issue their own banknotes , and money issued by provincial Scottish , English , Welsh and Irish banking companies circulated freely as a means of payment .
While the Bank of England eventually gained a monopoly for issuing banknotes in England and Wales , attempts to restrict Scottish banks from issuing notes were met with popular opposition .
In 1826 , there was outrage in Scotland at the attempt of the United Kingdom Parliament to prevent the production of banknotes of less than five pounds face value .
Sir Walter Scott wrote a series of letters to the Edinburgh Weekly Journal under the pseudonym " Malachi Malagrowther " which provoked such a response that the government was forced to relent and allow the Scottish banks to continue printing £ 1 notes .
For this reason Sir Walter still appears on all Bank of Scotland notes .
1995 SERIES Section::::1995 series .
Bank of Scotland 's previous note issue was in 1995 , known as the Tercentenary Series as they were issued in the year of the three hundredth anniversary of the foundation of the bank .
Each denomination features Sir Walter Scott on the front , and on the back are representations of industries that Scotland excels in :
* £ 5 note featuring a vignette of oil and energy * £ 10 note featuring a vignette of distilling and brewing
* £ 20 note featuring a vignette of education and research
* £ 50 note featuring a vignette of arts and culture
* £ 100 note featuring a vignette of leisure and tourism .
These notes continue in circulation and are gradually being replaced by the 2007 series .
2007
" BRIDGES " SERIES Section::::2007
" Bridges " series .
Bank of Scotland began issuing a new series of banknotes in the Autumn of 2007 , which feature the common theme of Scottish bridges .
It will take at least three years for the current issue of Bank of Scotland notes to be phased out of circulation .
In keeping with the bank 's tradition , the front of the notes depict an image of Sir Walter Scott ; the image on the 2007 series is based on the portrait of Scott painted by Henry Raeburn .
While the colours and sizes of all of the new notes are the same as previous designs , text on the notes is larger than before .
The raised , large denomination also acts as an aid for the partially sighted . '
Cornerstones ' have been added to the new notes .
These are watermark patterns on all corners of the notes , which will improve their durability .
Some new security features have also been added to the new design .
These include a metallic security thread embedded in every banknote , which contains the numerical value of the note and the note 's bridge image .
A new hologram and foil patch has been introduced on the front of the £ 20 , £ 50 and £ 100 notes , which features the Bank of Scotland logo and the numerical value of the note .
* £ 5 note features the Brig
o ' Doon * £ 10 note features the Glenfinnan Viaduct * £ 20 note features the Forth Bridge

The main theme of the bridges of Scotland are kept for this series , but have been redesigned to incorporate additional design features .
The portrait of Sir Walter Scott by Henry Raeburn is the same as the 2007 issues , but have been shifted from the center to the right side of the notes .
The bank 's headquarters , " The Mound " is featured at the center of the note .
