PLOT Section::::Plot .
Trevor ( Haley Joel Osment ) begins 7th grade in Las Vegas , Nevada .
His social studies teacher Eugene Simonet ( Kevin Spacey ) gives the class an assignment to devise and put into action a plan that will change the world for the better .
Trevor 's plan is a charitable program based on the networking of good deeds .
He calls his plan " pay it forward " , which means the recipient of a favor does a favor for three others rather than paying the favor back .
However , it needs to be a major favor that the recipient can not complete themselves .
Trevor does a favor for three people , asking each of them to " pay the favor forward " by doing favors for three other people , and so on , along a branching tree of good deeds .
His first good deed is to let a homeless man named Jerry ( Jim Caviezel ) live in his garage , and Jerry pays the favor forward by doing car repairs for Trevor 's mother .
Trevor 's efforts appear to fail when Jerry relapses into drug addiction , but Jerry pays his debt forward later by talking to a suicidal woman , who is about to jump off a bridge .
Meanwhile , Trevor 's mother Arlene ( Helen Hunt ) confronts Eugene about Trevor 's project after discovering Jerry in their house .
Trevor then selects Eugene as his next " pay it forward " target and tricks Eugene and Arlene into a romantic dinner date .
This also appears to fail until Trevor and Arlene argue about her love for Ricky , her alcoholic ex - husband , and she slaps him in a fit of anger .
The two adults are brought together again when Trevor runs away from home and Arlene asks Eugene to help her find him .
After finding Trevor , Arlene begins to pursue Eugene sexually .
Eugene has deep burn marks visible on his neck and face , and he initially resists Arlene 's overtures out of insecurity .
When they finally sleep together , he is seen to have extensive scarring all over his torso .
Arlene accepts Eugene 's physical disfigurement and forms an emotional bond with him , but quickly abandons their relationship when Ricky ( Jon Bon Jovi ) returns to her , claiming to have given up drinking .
His return and her acceptance of it angers Eugene , whose own mother had a habit of taking his abusive , alcoholic father back .
When Arlene attempts to explain to Eugene that she believes Ricky has changed for good , Eugene explains that his father intentionally burned him by knocking him unconscious , then pouring gasoline over him and igniting it .
He berates Arlene for being " one of those women " and warns her of Ricky 's potential to abuse Trevor .
When Ricky drinks again and resumes his abusive behavior , Arlene realizes her mistake and forces him to leave .
Trevor 's school assignment marks the beginning of the story 's chronology , but the opening scene in the film shows one of the later favors in the " pay it forward " tree , in which a man gives a car to Los Angeles journalist Chris Chandler ( Jay Mohr ) .
As the film proceeds , Chris traces the chain of favors back to its origin as Trevor 's school project .
After her date with Eugene , Arlene paid Jerry 's favor forward by forgiving her own mother , Grace ( Angie Dickinson ) , for her mistakes in raising Arlene , and Grace , who is homeless , helps a gang member escape from the police .
The gang member then saves a girl 's life in a hospital , and the girl 's father gives Chris his new car .
Chris finally identifies Trevor as the originator of " pay it forward " and conducts a recorded interview in which Trevor describes his hopes and concerns for the project .
Eugene , hearing Trevor 's words , realizes that he and Arlene should be together .
As Eugene and Arlene reconcile with an embrace , Trevor notices his friend , Adam , being bullied by gangster - like children , as he has several times before .
He pays it forward to Adam by rushing into the scene and fighting the bullies while Eugene and Arlene rush to stop him .
One of the bullies takes a switchblade out of his pocket and stabs Trevor in the abdomen with it .
The bullies run away and Trevor is taken to the hospital , where he dies from his injuries .
This news is reported on television as well as the fact that the movement is spreading across the country ; Arlene and Eugene are soon visited by hundreds of people who have participated in or heard of the " Pay It Forward " movement by gathering in a vigil to pay Trevor their respects .

PRODUCTION
Section::::Production .
Leslie Dixon adapted the screenplay from the book of the same name by Catherine Ryan Hyde , which was available as an open writing assignment .
Dixon struggled with the adaptation of the book in part because of multiple narrative voices within it .
Specifically , the reporter , the central character in the film , does not show up until halfway through the novel .
Stuck , Dixon considered returning the money she was paid for the assignment .
She eventually hit upon the idea to start with the reporter and trace the events backwards .
Dixon presented the idea to Hyde who in turn liked it so much that she decided to change the then unpublished novel 's plot structure to mirror the film 's .
In the novel , the character of Eugene Simonet was originally an African - American man named Reuben St. Clair .
The role was offered to Denzel Washington , but he turned it down .
Kevin Spacey was contacted next and accepted the role .

RECEPTION Section::::Reception .
The film opened at # 4 in the North American box office making $ 9,631,359 USD in its opening weekend , behind Remember the Titans , Bedazzled and Meet the Parents , which was on its third week at number one .
The film received mixed reviews , although the performances of Spacey , Hunt , and Osment were universally praised .
Rotten Tomatoes rated the film with 40 % based on 127 reviews with a consensus saying , " Pay It Forward has strong performances from Spacey , Hunt , and Osment , but the movie itself is too emotionally manipulative and the ending is bad . "
Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun - Times gave the film 2.5 stars out of a possible 4 stating , " With a cleaner story line , the basic idea could have been free to deliver .
As it is , we get a better movie than we might have , because the performances are so good :
Spacey as a vulnerable and wounded man ; Hunt as a woman no less wounded in her own way , and Osment , once again proving himself the equal of adult actors in the complexity and depth of his performance .
I believed in them and cared for them .
I wish the movie could have gotten out of their way . "
Entertainment Weekly 's Lisa Schwarzbaum gave it a " D " grade , calling it " reprehensible " for using " shameless cliches of emotional and physical damage " and then " blackmailing audiences into joining the let's - be - nice ' movement ' " in order to be transparent Oscar bait .
