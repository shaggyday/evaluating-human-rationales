All applications in CS4 featured the same user interface , with a new tabbed interface for working with concurrently running Adobe CS4 programs where multiple documents can be opened inside multiple tabs contained in a single window .
Adobe CS4 was also developed to perform better under 64-bit and multi - core processors .
On MS Windows , Adobe Photoshop CS4 ran natively as a 64-bit application .
Although they were not natively 64-bit applications , Adobe After Effects CS4 and Adobe Premiere Pro CS4 had been optimized for 64-bit computers .
However , there were no 64-bit versions of CS4 available for Mac OS X.
In early testing of 64-bit support in Adobe Photoshop CS4 , overall performance gains ranged from 8 % to 12 % , due to the fact that 64-bit applications could address larger amounts of memory and thus resulted in less file swapping — one of the biggest factors that can affect data processing speed .
Two programs were dropped from the CS4 line - up :
Adobe Ultra , a vector keying application which utilizes image analysis technology to produce high quality chroma key CREATIVE SUITE 5 CREATIVE SUITE 5.5 Section::::Creative Suite 5.5 .
Following the release of CS5 in April 2010 , Adobe changed its release strategy to an every other year release of major number installments .
CS5.5 was presented on April 12 , 2011 , as an in - between program until CS6 .
The update helped developers optimize websites for a variety of tablets , smart phones , and other devices .
At the same time , Adobe announced a subscription - based pay service as an alternative to full purchase .
On July 1 , 2011 , Adobe Systems announced its Switcher Program , which will allow people who had purchased any version of Apple 's Final Cut Pro ( or Avid Media Composer ) to receive a 50 percent discount on Creative Suite CS5.5 Production Premium or Premiere Pro CS5.5 .
Not all products were upgraded to CS5.5 in this release ; applications that were upgraded to CS5.5 included Adobe InDesign , Adobe Flash Catalyst , Adobe Flash Professional , Adobe Dreamweaver , Adobe Premiere Pro , Adobe After Effects , and Adobe Device Central .

During an Adobe conference call on June 21 , 2011 , CEO Shantanu Narayen said that the April 2011 launch of CS5.5 was " the first release in our transition to an annual release cycle " , adding , " We intend to ship the next milestone release of Creative Suite in 2012 .
"
On March 21 , 2012 , Adobe released a freely available beta version of Adobe Photoshop CS6 .
The final version of Adobe CS6 was launched on a release event April 23 , 2012 , and first shipped May 7 .
Adobe also launched a subscription - based offering named Adobe Creative Cloud DISCONTINUATION Section::::Discontinuation .
On May 5 , 2013 , during the opening keynote of its Adobe MAX conference , Adobe announced that it was retiring the " Creative Suite " branding in favor of " Creative Cloud " , and making all future feature updates to its software ( now appended with " CC " instead of " CS " , e.g. Photoshop CC ) available via the Creative Cloud subscription service rather than through the purchasing of perpetual licenses .
Customers must pay a subscription fee and if they stop paying , they will lose access to the proprietary file formats , which are not backward - compatible with the Creative Suite
( Adobe admitted that this is a valid concern ) .
Individual subscribers must have an Internet connection to download the software and to use the 2 GB of provided storage space ( or the additionally purchased 20 GB ) , and must validate the license monthly .
Adobe 's decision to make the subscription service the only sales route for its creative software was met with strong criticism ( see Creative Cloud controversy ) .
Several online articles began offering replacements of Photoshop , Illustrator , and other programs , with free software such as GIMP and Inkscape or competing products such as CorelDRAW , PaintShop Pro , and Pixelmator directly offering alternatives .
In addition to many of the products formerly part of the Creative Suite ( one product , Fireworks , was announced as having reached the end of its development cycle ) , Creative Cloud also offers subscription - exclusive products such as Adobe Muse and- the Adobe Edge family , Web - based file and website hosting , Typekit fonts , and access to the Behance social media platform .
The new CC versions of their applications , and the full launch of the updated Creative Cloud service , was announced for June 17 , 2013 .
New versions with major feature updates have been released regularly , with a refresh of the file formats occurring in October 2014 .
Adobe also announced that it would continue to offer bug fixes for the CS6 products so that they will continue to run on the next versions of Microsoft Windows and Apple OS X.
