WHITE COAT CEREMONY
The White Coat Ceremony ( WCC ) is a relatively new ritual in some medical ( MD , DO ) , dental , optometry , audiology , chiropractic , dietetic , occupational therapy , physical therapy , podiatric , pharmacy , physician assistant , pathologists ' assistant , nursing , naturopathic and veterinary schools that marks the student 's transition from the study of preclinical to clinical health sciences .
At some schools , where students begin meeting patients early in their education , the white coat ceremony is held before the first year begins .
It is an example of a matriculation .
WCCs typically involve a formal " coating " of students .
DESCRIPTION Section::::Description .
Over 100 medical schools in the United States now have a WCC , and many students now consider it a rite of passage in the journey toward a healthcare career .
Some schools also use this as a graduation from the entire program .
For example , Moreno Valley College has a White Coat Ceremony for the Physician Assistant students at the end of their final term , where the short coats are discarded and long coats are given as a symbol of being equal clinicians to others who have earned the long coats .
According to some , WCCs have taken on a quasi - religious significance , that symbolizes a " conversion " of a lay person into a member of the healthcare profession and is similar to a priest 's ordination to the priesthood , although it is notable that the white coat is a recent adoption by the medical profession .
However , in many medical schools around the world students begin wearing their white coats during first year anatomy class , so there is no official white coat ceremony .
In the nineteenth century respect for the certainty of science was in stark contrast to the quackery and mysticism of nineteenth century medicine .
To emphasize the transition to the more scientific approach to modern medicine , physicians sought to represent themselves as scientists and began to wear the most recognizable symbol of the scientist - the white laboratory coat .
This led to the more recent association of the white coat with medicine since its continued adoption .
HISTORY Section::::History .
WCCs originated in University of Chicago 's Pritzker School of Medicine in 1989 , but the first full - fledged ceremony was at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons .
In 1993 , Dr. Arnold P. Gold , a teacher and pediatric neurologist , created the first full - fledged WCC at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons .
Before this ceremony , medical students typically received the Hippocratic Oath for the first time at commencement .
This ceremony marks a change in tradition , introducing students to the Oath before starting their first year of study .
This was intended to provide students with well - defined guidelines regarding the expectations and responsibilities appropriate for the medical profession prior to their first day of class .
Since its conception at Columbia , the WCC has spread rapidly to schools of medicine , dentistry , pharmacy , osteopathic medicine , optometry , and nursing worldwide .
Since starting in the US , several medical schools in countries outside of the United States ( such as Iran , Israel , Canada , UK , Dominican Republic , Brazil and Poland ) have also started holding WCCs .
The ceremony is no longer limited to medical students ; starting in 1995 , US pharmacy schools started holding WCCs , with the difference that most pharmacy students receive their coats at the end of their first academic year .
In 2003 a survey found that the majority of US pharmacy schools hold WCCs .
The Gold - sponsored version of the WCC , or a similar rite of passage , is currently used by 97 percent of Association of American Medical Colleges ( AAMC)-accredited schools of medicine in the United States , and takes place at medical and osteopathic schools in 13 other countries .
