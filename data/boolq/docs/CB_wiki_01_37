INTERNATIONAL MEN 'S DAY
International Men 's Day ( IMD ) is an annual international event celebrated every year on 19 November .
Inaugurated in 1992 on February 7th by Thomas Oaster , the project of International Men 's Day was conceived one year earlier on 8 February 1991 .
The project was re - initialised in 1999 in Trinidad and Tobago .
The longest running celebration of International Men 's Day is Malta , where events have occurred since 7 February 1994 .
Jerome Teelucksingh , who revived the event , chose 19 November to honour his father 's birthday and also to celebrate how on that date in 1989 Trinidad and Tobago 's football team had united the country with their endeavours to qualify for the World Cup .
Teelucksingh has promoted International Men 's Day as not just a gendered day but a day where all issues affecting men and boys can be addressed .
He has said of IMD and its grass roots activists , " They are striving for gender equality and patiently attempt to remove the negative images and the stigma associated with men in our society " The objectives of celebrating an International Men 's Day , set out in " The Six Pillars of International Men 's Day " , include focusing on men 's and boys ' health , improving gender relations , promoting gender equality , and highlighting male role models .
It is an occasion to highlight discrimination against men and boys and to celebrate their achievements and contributions , in particular for their contributions to community , family , marriage , and child care .
The broader and ultimate aim of the event is to promote basic humanitarian values .
International Men 's Day is celebrated in over 80 countries , on 19 November , and global support for the celebration is broad .
International Men 's Day is followed by Universal Children 's Day on 20 November , forming a 48-hour celebration of men and children , respectively .
Additionally , the month of November is also occasionally recognized as International Men 's Month .
International Men 's Day is supported by a variety of organisations including UNESCO .
Speaking on behalf of UNESCO , Director of Women and Culture of Peace Ingeborg Breines said of IMD , " This is an excellent idea and would give some gender balance . "
She added that UNESCO was looking forward to cooperating with the organizers .
The day is not without controversy , with some questioning whether the event is necessary at all , and others arguing that some men have adopted it for misogynistic purposes .
HISTORY EARLY BACKGROUND Section::::History .
Section::::Early background .
Calls for an International Men 's Day have been noted since at least the 1960s , when many men were reported to " have been agitating privately to make 23 February International Men 's Day , the equivalent of 8 March , which is International Women 's Day "
In the Soviet Union this day was The Red Army and Navy Day since 1922 , which in 2002 was renamed to Defender of the Fatherland Day .
The date was informally viewed a male counterpart of Women 's Day ( 8 March ) in some territories of the Union , however due to the day 's limited focus to historical events some countries of the former union have moved to adopt the more ' male specific ' 19 November as International Men 's Day , including Belarus , Ukraine , Moldova , Russia and Georgia .
In 1968 American Journalist John P. Harris wrote an editorial in the Salina Journal highlighting a lack of balance in the Soviet system , which promoted an International Women 's Day for the female workers without promoting a corresponding day for male workers .
Harris stated that although he did not begrudge Soviet women their March day of glory , its resulting gender inequality clearly exhibited a serious flaw in the Communist system , which , " makes much of the equal rights it has given the sexes , but as it turns out , the women are much more equal than the men . "
Harris stated that while the men toiled along in their grooves doing what their government and womenfolk tell them to do , there was no day when males are recognised for their service , leading Harris to conclude that " This strikes me as unwarranted discrimination and rank injustice .
" Similar questions about the inequality of observing women 's day without a corresponding men 's day occurred in media publications from the 1960s through to the 1990s , at which time the first attempts at inaugurating international Men 's Day are recorded .
In the early 1990s , organizations in the United States , Australia and Malta held small events in February at the invitation of Thomas Oaster who directed the Missouri Center for Men 's Studies at the University of Missouri â€“ Kansas City .
Oaster successfully promoted the event in 1993 and 1994 , but his following attempt in 1995 was poorly attended and he ceased plans to continue the event in subsequent years .
Australians also ceased to observe the event ( until they re - established it on 19 November 2003 )
whilst the Maltese Association for Men 's Rights continued as the only country that continued to observe the event each year in February .
As the only remaining country still observing the original February date , the Maltese AMR Committee voted in 2009 to shift the date of their observation to 19 November to be in synchrony with all other countries which had begun to celebrate IMD on that date .
Although International Men 's and Women 's Day are considered to be ' gender focussed ' events , they are not ideological mirror images because they highlight issues that are considered unique to men or to women .
The history of IMD primarily concerns celebrating issues that are considered unique to men 's and boys experiences , along with the emphasis on positive role models " is deemed necessary in a social context which is often fascinated with images of males behaving badly ...
In highlighting positive male role models IMD attempts to show that males of all ages respond much more energetically to positive role models than they do to negative stereotyping . "
TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO Section::::Trinidad and Tobago .
Citizens in Trinidad and Tobago were the first to observe IMD on 19 November 1999 .
The event was conceived and coordinated by Jerome Teelucksingh from The University of the West Indies at the Families in Action headquarters in Newtown , Port of Spain .
As his rationale for creating the event Teelucksingh stated , " I realized there was no day for men ...
some have said that there is Father 's Day , but what about young boys , teenagers and men who are not fathers ? "
Teelucksingh , understanding the importance of celebrating good male role models , felt that his own father had been an example of an excellent role model and so chose 19 November partly because this was his father 's birthday , and also because it was the date on which a local sporting team in his country created a level of unity with transcended gender , religious and ethnic divisions .
The idea of celebrating an International Men 's Day received written support from officials in UNESCO and the event has continued to be celebrated annually in Trinidad and Tobago and other countries since its beginning .
JAMAICA Section::::Jamaica .
Jamaicans held an inaugural IMD observation on 19 November 2001 , with a church service at Northgate Family Church in Ocho Rios , an educational session with male students at Ferncourt High School , and public forum at Brown 's Town Community College .
Keynote speaker at the event was Luciano who talked on the theme of ' Today 's Man , Tomorrow 's Future ' .
A special theme of the event was discussions on men 's sexual health and reproduction .
Nurse Bunnaman of the Beth Jacobs Family Planning Clinic in St. Ann 's Bay told The Star Newspaper " This is the first time that Jamaica will be observing International Men 's Day .
It was started in Trinidad in 1999 .
This year it will be observed in Kenya , Tanzania , Norway , Brazil , Germany , Britain and the United States of America as well " .
Educational sessions about men 's sexual health and reproduction were held the Beth Jacobs Clinic , where medical check - ups and testicular checks were given free of charge .
AUSTRALIA Section::::Australia .
Australians have celebrated IMD on 19 November since 2003 , when Phil Gouldson of Men 's Health and Wellbeing Association ACT ( MHWA ) launched the inaugural event after receiving an invitation by Trinidad and Tobago 's Harrack Balramsingh to join in the event .
In Canberra , 2004 , Gouldson asked men in Australia to wear a red rose for IMD and for women and families to buy the men in their life flowers .
He said a red rose is worn by men on IMD as a symbol of strength of character and courage , and as it is unusual to see men being given flowers so it is a good way to highlight the occasion .
In 2004 , Michael Flood , an academic , criticized the basis of the ' Men 's Health and Wellbeing Association ' ( MHWA ) 's IMD celebration which focused on men 's health , arguing that there were already enough opportunities to work on men 's health and fatherhood ( citing Father 's Day and Men 's Health Week ) .
Gouldson responded , reminding that " Not all men and boys are fathers , while Men 's Health Week focuses on claimed inadequacies of men in not better managing their health . "
Teelucksingh independently highlighted the need to address the needs of young boys , teenagers and men who are not fathers , which was one of his primary purposes for establishing International Men 's Day .
In 2008 Dads4Kids Organization highlighted the theme ' honour and sacrifice ' , pointing to the sinking of the cruiser HMAS Sydney on 19 November during the Second World War which resulted in the death of 645 men off the coast of Geraldton in Western Australia .
Organisers said , " men make sacrifices every day in their place of work , in their role as husbands and fathers , for their families , for their friends , for their communities and for their nation . "
In 2009 , a number of events were held throughout Australia including IMD initiatives organized by four local governments : Maitland City Council in N.S.W. , Greater Hume Shire Council in Victoria , Ipswich City Council in Queensland , and Forbes Shire Council in N.S.W.
each of whom funded local observations .
These were the first government bodies in Australia to fund and host community IMD events .
In the State Parliament of Western Australia Minister Nick Goiran gave a speech introducing International Men 's Day and its objectives to the parliament , focussing on the promotion of gender equality and the importance of highlighting positive male role models .
There was also an event held in the Federal Australian Parliament House with several notable speakers .
Numerous other organisations hosted observations including the Men 's Shed Steering Committee in Rockhampton , the Community Resource center in Ulladulla , the Regional Health Service in KooWeeRup , and Dads on the Air radio programme in Sydney which hosted an hour - long programme discussing IMD with a panel of international coordinators of the event .

INDIA Section::::India .
The inaugural celebration of IMD in India was organized by the leading Indian Men 's rights organization Save Indian Family on 19 November 2007 .
The date of 19 November was accepted based on the fact that Australia and the West Indies ( Jamaica , Trinidad and Tobago ) were already observing IMD on that date .
The event was again celebrated in India in 2008 , and plans have been made to continue the celebration annually .
In 2009 , India received the first corporate sponsorship of the International Men 's Day with menswear brand Allen Solly deciding to create promotional offers on IMD , and HBO deciding to screen male - positive movies in its " Men in Back " series on 19 November .
In November 2014 Confidare Education Consultancy hosted an International Men 's Day Art Gallery in New Delhi , while in Kolkata protests were held to highlight elder abuse and men 's human rights .
Other men 's rights activists posed questions on the occasion of IMD , asking why are men deprived of gender neutral laws , why should not the domestic violence act be made gender neutral , and why are fathers deprived of children 's custody in case of separated spouses .
The Chennai Chapter of All India Men 's Welfare Association ( AIMWA ) submitted a memorandum to the government on IMD 2014 demanding constitution of Men 's Welfare Ministry , National Commission for Men , and making all laws gender neutral .
In 19 November 2018 , Avijan ( a welfare and charitable trust for men ) has made a massive protest in Kolkata , which covers by many press and media .

SEYCHELLES Section::::Seychelles .
On 19 November 2012 Government Minister Vincent Meriton declared this year the first that IMD has been celebrated at a National Government level .
Minister Meriton said , " The time has come for us to adopt a new approach , instead of reinforcing negative stereotyping of males behaving badly , e.g. media portrayals of males as violent , power - hungry , irresponsible and so on .
Such negative images are frequently used in an attempt to shame males into behaving more positively . "
Meriton stated that the practice of negative stereotyping ignores the fact that such negative behaviours do not apply to the vast majority of men and boys , or that such negativity may detrimentally impact the self - image and self - esteem of boys , which in turn impacts their willingness to contribute to building better relationships and communities as they grow into adults .
In conclusion he stated that " International Men 's Day calls for and promotes positive masculinity which we in Seychelles can strongly identify with as it forms part of the social renaissance campaign launched at the beginning of the year by President James Michel . " BURUNDI Section::::Burundi .
