PLOT Section::::Plot .
Soon - to - retire detective William Somerset is partnered with short - tempered but idealistic David Mills , who has recently moved to the city with his wife Tracy .
Tracy confides to Somerset that she is pregnant and has yet to tell Mills , as she is unhappy with the city and feels it is no place to raise a child .
Somerset sympathizes , having had a similar situation with his ex - girlfriend many years earlier , and advises her to tell Mills only if she plans to keep the child .
Somerset and Mills investigate a set of murders inspired by the seven deadly sins : a man forced to eat until his stomach ruptured , representing gluttony , and a defense attorney killed after a pound of flesh was taken from him , representing greed .
Clues at the murder scenes lead them to a suspect 's apartment , where they find a third victim , a drug dealer and child molester , strapped to a bed , emaciated but alive , representing sloth .
Daily photographs of the victim , taken over a year , show the crimes were planned far in advance .
The detectives use library records to identify a John Doe and track him to his apartment .
Doe flees and Mills gives chase .
Doe turns to hold Mills at gunpoint for a moment before escaping .
The apartment contains hundreds of notebooks revealing Doe 's psychopathy , as well as a clue to another murder .
The detectives arrive too late to stop a man forced by Doe at gunpoint to kill a prostitute by raping her with a custom - made , bladed strap - on , representing lust .
The following day , they attend the scene of a fifth murder , a model whose face has been mutilated by Doe ; she was given the option to call for help and live disfigured , or commit suicide by taking pills , representing pride .
As Somerset and Mills return to the police station , Doe turns himself in , covered in the blood of an unidentified victim .
Doe offers to take the detectives to the final two victims and confess to the murders , but only under specific terms , or he will plead insanity .
Somerset is wary , but Mills agrees .
The detectives follow Doe 's directions to a remote desert location .
Within minutes , a delivery van approaches .
Mills holds Doe at gunpoint while Somerset intercepts the driver , who has been instructed to bring a box to them .
Doe begins to taunt Mills by telling him how envious he was of his life with Tracy .
Somerset opens the box and , in a sudden panic , warns Mills to stay back .
Doe then says that his sin was envy , and that Tracy died as a result of this ; he also states that her head is in the box , and that she was pregnant .
Despite Somerset 's warnings , Mills shoots Doe , representing wrath , and completing Doe 's plan .
Police converge and take the devastated Mills away .

PRODUCTION PRE - PRODUCTION Section::::Production . Section::::Pre - production .
The primary influence for the film 's screenplay came from Andrew Kevin Walker 's time spent in New York City while trying to make it as a screenwriter .
" I did n't like my time in New York , but it 's true that if I had n't lived there
I probably would n't have written Seven . "
He envisioned actor William Hurt as Somerset and named the character after his favorite author , W. Somerset Maugham .
Jeremiah S. Chechik was attached to direct at one point .
During pre - production , Al Pacino was considered for the Somerset role , but he decided to do City Hall .
Denzel Washington and Sylvester Stallone turned down the role of Mills .
Washington later regretted turning down the role .
The ending of the screenplay , with the head in the box , was originally part of an earlier draft that New Line had rejected , instead opting for an ending that involved more traditional elements of a detective thriller film with more action - oriented elements .
But when New Line sent David Fincher the screenplay to review for his interest in the project , they accidentally sent him the original screenplay with the head - in - the - box ending .
At the time , Fincher had not read a script for a year and a half since the frustrating experience of making Alien 3 ; he said , " I thought I 'd rather die of colon cancer than do another movie " .
Fincher eventually agreed to direct Seven because he was drawn to the script , which he found to be a " connect - the - dots movie that delivers about inhumanity .
It 's psychologically violent .
It implies so much , not about why you did but how you did it " .
He found it more a " meditation on evil " rather than a " police procedural " .
When New Line realized that they had sent Fincher the wrong draft , the President of Production , Michael De Luca , met with Fincher and noted that there was internal pressure to retain the revised version ; De Luca stated that if Fincher promised to produce the movie , they would be able to stay with the head - in - a - box ending .
Despite this , producer Kopelson refused to allow the film to include the head - in - a - box scene .
Actor Pitt joined Fincher in arguing for keeping this original scene , noting that his previous film Legends of the Fall had its emotional ending cut after negative feedback from test audiences , and refusing to do Seven unless the head - in - the - box scene remained .
FILMING Section::::Filming .
Fincher approached making Seven like a " tiny genre movie , the kind of movie Friedkin might have made after The Exorcist . "
He worked with cinematographer Darius Khondji and adopted a simple approach to the camerawork , which was influenced by the television show COPS , " how the camera is in the backseat peering over people 's shoulder " .
Fincher allowed Walker on the set while filming for on - the - set rewrites .
According to the director , " Seven is the first time I got to carry through certain things about the camera â€“ and about what movies are or can be " .
The crowded urban streets filled with noisy denizens and an oppressive rain that seems to fall without respite were integral parts of the film , as Fincher wanted to show a city that was " dirty , violent , polluted , often depressing .
Visually and stylistically , that 's how we wanted to portray this world .
Everything needed to be as authentic and raw as possible .
" To this end , Fincher turned to production designer Arthur Max to create a dismal world that often eerily mirrors its inhabitants .
" We created a setting that reflects the moral decay of the people in it " , says Max .
" Everything is falling apart , and nothing is working properly .
" The film 's brooding , dark look was achieved through a chemical process called bleach bypass , wherein the silver in the film stock was not removed , which in turn deepened the dark , shadowy images in the film and increased its overall tonal quality .
The ' head in a box ' ending continued to worry the studio after filming was completed .
After the first cut of the film was shown to the studio , they attempted to mitigate the bleakness of the ending by replacing Mills ' wife 's head with that of a dog , or by not having Mills fire on John Doe .
However , both Fincher and Pitt continued to fight for the original ending .
The final scenes of Mills being taken away and Somerset 's quote from Ernest Hemingway were filmed by Fincher after initial filming was complete as a way to placate the studio ( the original intention was for the film to suddenly end after Mills shot John Doe ) .
TITLE SEQUENCE
Section::::Title sequence .
Originally , Fincher planned the title sequence of the film to show Freeman 's character buying a house in a remote country area and traveling back into the city .
However , days before a test screening , they had yet to film the sequence and had no budget to do it in that time .
Fincher approached Kyle Cooper to suggest a replacement .
Cooper recognized the amount of money used to make John Doe 's notebooks ( created by Clive Piercy and John Sabel ) , and used the sequence to display them in a slideshow set to Nine Inch Nails ' " Closer " .
The hand - drawn credits font was used to suggest that Doe had written the credits himself .
The studio liked the sequence and suggested he stay with that .
Fincher instead asked Cooper to " pretend we 've never met and come back and propose something else " , according to Cooper .
Cooper came up with a more detailed version of this photographic sequence : "
The idea was that this is John Doe 's job : he gets up , makes his books , plans his murders , drinks his tea .
"
Fincher liked this approach , but cautioned Cooper "
Well , that would be neat , but that 's kind of a 2D glimpse .
Figure out a way for it to involve John Doe , to show that somewhere across town somebody is working on some really evil shit .
I do n't want it to be just flipping through pages , as beautiful as they are . "
Cooper reworked the idea , working with Wayne Coe to create a storyboard for a live - action shot and adding in filming along with photographs of the books , new props include film reels and additional notebooks , visual effects for the title credits , and elements inspired by Doe 's behavior in the movie , such as cutting his fingertips .
Fincher liked this approach , and considered getting Mark Romanek , the director of the " Closer " music video to produce the sequence , but Cooper insisted he direct it .
Cooper was assisted by film editor Angus Wall and cinematographer Harris Savides in making the final title sequence .
The filming took two days and five further weeks to edit .
The credits were hand - etched onto black scratchboard and manipulated by the camera , rather than using digital effects .
The final sequence used a remix of " Closer " created by the band Coil .

CRITICAL RESPONSE
Section::::Critical response .
The film was well received by critics and holds an 80 % positive rating at the film - review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , based on 71 critics with an average rating of 7.8/10 .
Its consensus reads : " A brutal , relentlessly grimy shocker with taut performances , slick gore effects , and a haunting finale . "
The film has a rating of 65 on Metacritic based on 22 reviews .
Gary Arnold , in The Washington Times , praised the cast : " The film 's ace in the hole is the personal appeal generated by Mr. Freeman as the mature , cerebral cop and Mr. Pitt as the young , headstrong cop .
Not that the contrast is inspired or believable in itself .
What gets to you is the prowess of the co - stars as they fill out sketchy character profiles . "
Sheila Johnston , in her review for The Independent , praised Freeman 's performance : " The film belongs to Freeman and his quiet , carefully detailed portrayal of the jaded older man who learns not to give up the fight . "
James Charisma , in a list of Spacey 's greatest film performances for Paste , wrote : " Spacey 's portrayal is a perfect balancing act : John Doe is detached from the murders he commits , yet deliberate and meticulous in his execution ...
Unemotional yet smug .
Analytical , violent , patient , impenetrable .
"
In his review for Sight and Sound , John Wrathall wrote , " Seven has the scariest ending since George Sluizer 's original The Vanishing ... and stands as the most complex and disturbing entry in the serial killer genre since Manhunter . "
In his " Great Movies " list review , film critic Roger Ebert commented on Fincher 's direction : " None of his films is darker than this one . "
