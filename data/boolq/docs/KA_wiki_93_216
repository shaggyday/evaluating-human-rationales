Luke Y. Thompson of Forbes gave it a fresh rating , writing " I ca n't begrudge you waiting until 211 shows up on a Blu - ray at Walmart that also contains ten other Cage movies ...
But I can tell you that when it does , you should n't skip over this one . "
Other reviewers were not as complimentary .
Jacob Knight from Birth Movies Death declared it rotten , writing , " Nic Cage 's latest DTV action endeavour is a bizarre slog .
"
Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun - Times gave it 2/4 and wrote , " A muddled , overcrowded , trigger - happy heist movie brimming with clich√©s while constantly trying our patience .
"
Glenn Kenny of RogerEbert.com gave it 1/4 , describing it as " This effort is a cavalcade of crap .
Loud crap . "
Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote , " It 's probably foolish to wish that Nicolas Cage would once again make movies as good as Adaptation and Leaving Las Vegas .
But is it too much to ask that he go back to the comparative glory days of Con Air and The Rock ? " .
Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote , " Unsurprisingly , the director does n't get very good work from a cast asked primarily to ramp up the intensity on stereotypes . "
