A condition referred to as " Steve Blass disease " has become a part of baseball lexicon .
The " diagnosis " is applied to talented players who inexplicably and permanently seem to lose their ability to throw a baseball accurately .
The fielder 's variant of " Steve Blass disease " is sometimes referred to in baseball terminology as " Steve Sax syndrome " .
Notable victims of " Steve Blass disease " include Rick Ankiel , Mark Wohlers , Dontrelle Willis , Ricky Romero , and Daniel Bard .
In an interview years later , Blass mentioned that he was content with how his career panned out , mentioning that he had gotten ten good years with the Pirates , won 100 games , and appeared in a World Series .
He did mention that the sudden death of teammate and close friend Roberto Clemente in the offseason before he lost control – and the associated grief related to suddenly losing someone so close – did not play a factor in him losing his control .
