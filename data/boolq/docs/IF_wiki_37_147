The area officially opened in the Islands of Adventure theme park on June 18 , 2010 .
The Harry Potter - themed area saw attendance at Islands of Adventure rise by as much as 36 % in 2010 .
According to Jason Garcia of the Orlando Sentinel , this led to resort executives pondering " when to expand Wizarding World and how to keep business balanced between Islands and Universal Studios Florida " .
In April 2011 , Brady MacDonald of the Los Angeles Times speculated that an area expansion would include the addition of Diagon Alley and a Gringotts - themed dark ride in place of the Lost Continent themed area in the park .
On December 6 , 2011 , Universal park officials confirmed that an expansion would take place and described it as " significant " .
The announcement was made four days after the park confirmed the removal of Jaws , a ride scheduled to close permanently on January 2 , 2012 .
Demolition of the Jaws ride and the surrounding Amity area began soon after its closure .
After the site was levelled , work began on land reclamation as well as the construction of a series of buildings , including a large show building for the Gringotts ride .
Further details about the expansion were announced on May 8 , 2013 , confirming new feature attractions themed after Diagon Alley and London .
On January 23 , 2014 , the name of the area 's flagship attraction was revealed to be Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts .
It was later described as a " virtual reality roller coaster " by Entertainment Weekly as additional details were released in May 2014 .
The new ride opened on July 8 , 2014 , alongside other attractions in the new Diagon Alley section of the park .
The building housing the attraction features a dragon statue perched over the entrance that utilizes special effects to simulate the breathing of fire .

After guests board their cart , the vehicle races along the tracks , just before security alarms go off as a security breach is detected and the bank goes on lockdown .
Bellatrix Lestrange appears , after receiving word of an impostor infiltration , and decides to torture the guests by cutting off the track and tilting it .
This sends the cart speeding toward the vaults as stalagmites can be seen to give an impression of being deep underground .
Bill Weasley casts Arresto Momentum to stop the cart and apologizes just before Harry , Ron , Hermione and Griphook , emerge from the Thieve 's Downfall , which has washed away the Polyjuice Potion 's effect off Hermione .
Their cart drops from a high altitude as security trolls climb up , pushing Bill and Blordak off the cart .
A security troll pushes the guests ' cart further , past the Thief 's Downfall and stops in front of more security trolls .

After entering the vault , the walls come crashing down and Nagini appears in an attempt to attack guests .
Bellatrix reappears , this time alongside Lord Voldemort , who confronts guests , questioning them on their knowledge of Harry Potter 's whereabouts .
He blames Bellatrix for the vault infiltration , who again decides to torture guests sending them to a lava - filled chamber deep in the vaults .
To further torture guests into revealing Harry Potter 's whereabouts , Voldemort decides to administer " a little dose of pain to help you remember " and conjures a ball of fire .
The Ukrainian Ironbelly crashes in from the opposite side , and Harry casts a counterspell , while the dragon spits fire towards Voldemort , who shields himself and Bellatrix and later furiously retreat .
Hermione casts a spell to hook the cart to the dragon in order to get guests safely out of the vaults and Ron casts Confringo to create an escape route .
