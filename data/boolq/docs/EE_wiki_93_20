THE WOOLPACK
The Woolpack is a fictional public house on the popular ITV soap opera Emmerdale .
Its sign is a wool bale , a popular symbol in sheep - rearing country .
It has played host to many of the soap 's storylines and is the focus of the programme .
It is the second oldest TV soap pub , opening its doors in October 1972 and being preceded by The Rovers Return Inn which opened in December 1960 and succeeded by The Queen Victoria which opened in February 1985 .
The Woolpack is the only soap pub to have changed locations as part of a story - line .
In 1976 , the original Woolpack was found to be suffering from subsidence .
Another building was bought by landlords Amos Brearly and Henry Wilks and made its debut as The Woolpack later the same year .
This was to cover Emmerdale Farm 's move from Arncliffe to Esholt for location filming .
The first Woolpack was the Falcon Inn in Arncliffe .
When the outdoor scenes were moved to Esholt in 1976 the Commercial Inn was chosen as the new Woolpack .
The present Woolpack is on the purpose - built Emmerdale village set on the Harewood estate which is based on Esholt .
The 1993 plane crash saw the Woolpack wine bar demolished trapping many people inside and paralysing Chris Tate from the waist down .
It was also involved in the storm of 2003 where the roof was struck by lightning which caused the chimney to fall through the roof causing a window to collapse and fall on Tricia Dingle , which eventually resulted in her death .
For the show 's live episode ( Emmerdale 's 40th birthday ) in October 2012 the bar area was recreated within the " shell " that resides on the backlot at Harewood House .
Previously all interior scenes were shot solely back in Leeds .
The Woolpack 's cellar , the living quarters and Marlon 's kitchen would all be inside the village 's Bed and Breakfast at Harewood House based on the studio 's set layout .

THE MALT SHOVEL Section::::The Malt Shovel .
For many years the Woolpack had a rival pub in the village called The Malt Shovel which was supposedly slightly downmarket compared to the Woolpack .

The Malt Shovel was later redeveloped into an upmarket bar , Malt , to the chagrin of then Woolpack Landlady Val Pollard .
