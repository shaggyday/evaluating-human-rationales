SANTA CLARITA , CALIFORNIA Santa Clarita , officially the City of Santa Clarita , is the third largest city in Los Angeles County , California , and the 24th largest in the state of California .
The city has annexed a number of unincorporated areas , contributing to the large population increase .
It is located about northwest of downtown Los Angeles , and occupies most of the Santa Clarita Valley .
It is a notable example of a U.S. edge city or boomburb .
Santa Clarita was ranked by Money magazine in 2006 as 18th of the top 100 places to live .
Santa Clarita was incorporated in December 1987 as the union of four unincorporated communities , Canyon Country , Newhall , Saugus , and Valencia , most of which are situated on the land of the former Rancho San Francisco .
The four communities retain separate identities , and it is common for residents to refer to a specific neighborhood when asked where they are from .
Santa Clarita is bounded on the west by the Golden State Freeway ( I-5 ) .
The Antelope Valley Freeway ( SR-14 ) runs northeast - southwest through an irregular east border , and the Newhall Pass is the city 's southernmost point .
Six Flags Magic Mountain amusement park and Stevenson Ranch are both commonly associated with Santa Clarita , but are located just outside the city limits .
NAME Section::::Name .
The Santa Clara River was named by Spanish explorers for Clare of Assisi .
The valley and the settlement later became known as " little Santa Clara " in deference to the Northern California mission and city of Santa Clara , California .
In time , " little Santa Clara " became " Santa Clarita . "
HISTORY Section::::History .
Santa Clarita was incorporated in December 1987 , but its history stretches back several centuries .
About AD 450 , the Tataviam arrived , numbering around 2,000 at their zenith .
In 1842 , Francisco Lopez made the first " documented " discovery of gold in California .
The event is memorialized in an 1842 mining claim issued by Gov. Juan B. Alvarado .
The discovery was made in Placerita Canyon , an area later used as Hollywood 's original back lot .
The community of Newhall is named after Henry Newhall , a businessman who made his fortune during the California Gold Rush after opening up the H.M. Newhall & Company , a successful auction house in San Francisco .
Newhall 's next business interest was railroads .
He invested in rail companies that would connect San Francisco to other cities and became president of the San Francisco and San Jose Railroad .
In 1870 , he and his partners sold the company to Southern Pacific Railroad , on whose board of directors he then sat .
After railroads , Newhall turned to real estate and ranching .
He purchased a number of the old Spanish and Mexican land grants in the state for a total of between Monterey and Los Angeles counties .
The most significant portion was the Rancho San Francisco in northern Los Angeles County , which he purchased for $ 2 / acre , and which became known as Newhall Ranch after Newhall 's death .
Within this territory , he granted a right - of - way to Southern Pacific through what is now Newhall Pass , and he also sold them part of the land , upon which the company built a town named after him : Newhall .
The first station built on the line he named for his hometown , Saugus , Massachusetts .
After his death , Newhall 's heirs incorporated the Newhall Land and Farming Company , which oversaw the development of the communities that now make up Santa Clarita .
On September 26 , 1876 , Charles Alexander Mentry brought in the state 's first productive oil well at Mentryville , giving rise to the California oil industry .
The oil was brought to a refinery at Newhall , now the oldest existing petroleum refinery in the world ; it was operational from 1874 to 1888 .
A few days earlier , on September 5 , 1876 , Charles Crocker and Leland Stanford joined their railroads in Canyon Country , linking Los Angeles with the rest of the nation for the first time .
The Saugus Cafe , on Railroad Avenue in Saugus , was established in 1887 and appears to be , by far , the oldest still - operating restaurant in Los Angeles County .
Filming in Santa Clarita began shortly after the turn of the 20th century with a veritable
Who 's Who of actors , including William S. Hart , Tom Mix , Harry Carey and a young John Wayne .
Hart and Carey made their homes in the Santa Clarita Valley ; today both are operated as county parks .
The Santa Clarita Valley was the scene of the second worst disaster in California 's history in terms of lives lost , known as the " worst civil engineering failure of the 20th century " .
Shortly before midnight on March 12 , 1928 , the St. Francis Dam collapsed .
By the time the floodwaters reached the Pacific Ocean near Ventura five hours later , nearly 600 people were dead .
Within modern Santa Clarita city limits , the present day site of the Westfield Valencia Town Center mall would have been buried beneath muck , mud and debris .
Some buildings in Newhall became makeshift morgues .
After multiple failed attempts to form a city and at least two failed attempts to form a separate county , the people of the Santa Clarita Valley finally incorporated the City of Santa Clarita at 4:30 PM on December 15 , 1987 after voting in favor of incorporation by a margin of two to one in that year 's general election .
The other proposed name for the new city , which was narrowly defeated , was " City of the Canyons . "
