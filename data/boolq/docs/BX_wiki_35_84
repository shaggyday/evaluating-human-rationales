RECORDS OF PRIME MINISTERS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
The article lists the records of Prime Ministers of Great Britain and of the United Kingdom since 1721 .
PERIOD OF SERVICE Section::::Period of service .
The Prime Minister with the longest single term was Sir Robert Walpole , lasting 20 years and 315 days from 3 April 1721 until 11 February 1742 .
This is also longer than the accumulated terms of any other Prime Minister .
The shortest period in office is more confused , depending on the criteria .
The shortest ever period was only three days , a record held by Lord Bath , from 10 February to 12 February 1746 , who was asked to form a government but was unable to find more than one person who would agree to serve in his cabinet .
A satirist of the time wrote : " the minister to the astonishment of all wise men never transacted one rash thing ; and , what is more marvellous , left as much money in the Treasury as he found in it . "
James Waldegrave , 2nd Earl Waldegrave was a prime minister for four days , from 8 June to 12 June 1757 .
However , since neither of these Earls actually formed an effective government , there are other contenders for the record of shortest term of office among those who actually governed the country .
In November 1834 , the Duke of Wellington declined to become Prime Minister in favour of Sir Robert Peel but formed a " caretaker " administration for 25 days ( 17 November 18349 December 1834 )
while Peel returned from Europe .
However , as a caretaker administration this might not necessarily be considered a term of office in its own right .
Therefore , of those with clear and effective terms , the Prime Minister with the shortest single one was Lord Rockingham , whose second term lasted 96 days from 27 March 1782 until his death on 1 July 1782 .
However , combined with his first term ( 13 July 176530 July 1766 )
his total time in office was 1 year and 113 days , which exceeds the total periods of several other Prime Ministers .
( The Duke of Wellington had also served as Prime Minister between 1828 and 1830 . )
Consequently , the Prime Minister with the total shortest period in office was George Canning , whose sole term lasted 119 days from 12 April 1827 until his death on 8 August 1827 .
The Prime Minister with the longest period between the start of their first appointment and the end of their final term was the Duke of Portland , whose first term began on 2 April 1783 and whose second and final term ended on 4 October 1809 .
NUMBER OF TERMS Section::::Number of terms .
A Prime Minister 's " term " is traditionally regarded as the period between their appointment and resignation , dismissal ( or death , in the case of those who die in office ) , with the number of general elections taking place in the intervening period making no difference .
The only Prime Minister to serve four terms under that definition was William Ewart Gladstone ( 3 December 186820 February 1874 , 23 April 188023 June 1885 , 1 February 188625 July 1886 and 15 August 18925 March 1894 ) .

Until 1837 the death of a sovereign led to Parliament being dissolved within six months which led to a general election .
Results of such elections were : SERVED UNDER
