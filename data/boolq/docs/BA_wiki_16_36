When asked in 2014 , if he kept in touch with everybody from Sanford & Son , especially Foxx ( who died on October 11 , 1991 ) , he responded : " No .
I saw Redd Foxx once before he died , circa 1983 , and I never saw him again .
At the time I was playing tennis at the Malibu Racquet Club
and I was approached by some producers about doing a Redd Foxx 50th Anniversary Special .
I had n't spoken to him since 1977 , and I called the club where ( Redd ) was playing .
And we met at Redd 's office , but he was less than affable .
I told those guys it was a bad idea .
I never had a cross word with him .
People say I 'm protective of Redd Foxx in my book ( Second Banana , Wilson 's memoir of the Sanford years ) .
I had no animosity toward Foxx for ( quitting the show in 1977 ) because I had a million dollar contract at CBS to do Baby ...
I 'm Back ! .
My hurt was that he did n't come to me about throwing the towel in - I found out in the hallway at NBC from a newscaster .
I forgave him
and I loved Redd , but I never forgot that .
The love was there .
You can watch any episode and see that . "
