ROMA
TOMATO Roma tomato or Roma is a plum tomato popularly used both for canning and producing tomato paste because of their slender and firm nature .
Commonly found in supermarkets in some countries , Roma tomatoes are also known as Italian tomatoes or Italian plum tomatoes .
Roma tomatoes are grown in the United States , Mexico , Australia , and Great Britain .
TYPES Section::::Types .
The " Roma VF " variant is most common in seed catalogs as of 2007 .
It was developed by the USDA 's Agricultural Research Service ( ARS ) scientists in Beltsville , Maryland in the 1950s as a fusarium wilt - resistant cultivar .
While Roma is an open - pollinated variety rather than a hybrid , it has been steadily improved to the point where most Roma tomato vines are verticillium and fusarium wilt resistant ( thus the VF in the name ) .
Most commercial plum tomatoes sold in markets in the Western Hemisphere
are Romas or related types .
Smaller plum tomatoes about the size of cherry tomatoes are sometimes sold as " baby Romas " .
A smaller relative known as " Windowbox Roma " is sold as a tomato suitable for window gardens and hanging containers .
DESCRIPTION Section::::Description .
Roma tomatoes are egg or pear - shaped and red when fully ripe .
They have few seeds and are a good canning and sauce tomato .
While Roma is an open - pollinated variety , in general it is not considered an heirloom tomato .
Maturing in under three months , the plant itself grows to 1 meter ( 36 inches ) in height and the single fruit weighs about 60 grams ( 2 oz ) .
The vines fruit heavily , making Roma a popular variety with gardeners who do a lot of home canning .
