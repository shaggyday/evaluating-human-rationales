PLOT Section::::Plot .
After breaking up with her boyfriend Ben , Michelle drives away from New Orleans .
While in rural Louisiana , she hears news reports of blackouts in several major cities before she is sideswiped by a truck and knocked off the road , falling unconscious .
Michelle wakes in a locked room within an underground bunker
, her wounds tended to .
Howard , the bunker 's owner , tells her he brought her there for her protection , claiming that the air outside has been poisoned by nuclear or chemical fallout from an unknown force .
Michelle is initially hostile towards Howard , but once she has calmed down , Howard takes her on a tour of the well - stocked bunker , and she meets Emmett , another survivor who found his way to it .
Howard takes her to the viewport of the bunker 's exit hatch , showing her two dead pigs outside as evidence of the fallout ; Michelle also sees Howard 's truck , and recognizes it from the accident .
Michelle privately relays her concerns about Howard 's motivations to Emmett .
During their first dinner together , Michelle secretly takes Howard 's keys and makes her way to the hatch , but as she is about to open it , a woman , Leslie , covered in skin lesions , slams against the window demanding she be let in , then collapses .
Michelle openly returns the keys and agrees that Howard was right .
Howard admits to accidentally hitting her car in his panic to get to the shelter .
While the trio 's relationship becomes more relaxed , Howard still shows intolerance towards Emmett and treats Michelle as a little girl ; however , Howard opens up about his daughter who he states is " not with us anymore " .
Howard enlists Michelle to fix the air filtration unit when it fails since she is small enough to fit through the vents ; while repairing it , she finds a locked skylight , with the word " HELP " scratched into its glass and visible to anyone outside .
Further suspicious of Howard , Michelle and Emmett discover that Howard 's purported daughter was a young girl who had gone missing about two years earlier , and they suspect he abducted her to the bunker .
They make plans to escape the bunker , creating a makeshift Hazmat suit behind Howard 's back .
When Howard discovers tools and parts missing , he accuses the two of stealing them , threatening to immerse them in a barrel of perchloric acid .
When Emmett takes sole responsibility , Howard coldly kills Emmett with a gun .
In shock , Michelle is desperately making final preparations to leave , when she is surprised by Howard .
She manages to escape from him with the suit .
En route , she knocks over the acid barrel , which starts an electrical fire in the bunker .
It later explodes , killing Howard .
Michelle dons the suit and escapes the burning bunker onto Howard 's homestead .
Seeing signs of living wildlife , she takes off the suit 's helmet , but then she suddenly sees a giant biomechanical alien spacecraft , drawn by the bunker fire .
A quadrupedal creature drops from the craft and chases Michelle , forcing her to hide in a shed .
She then races towards the farmhouse , but the craft appears and emits a green gas that forces Michelle back into the suit .
Her delay allows mechanical appendages from the ship to capture her , but she is able to craft a Molotov cocktail from items in Howard 's truck to throw into the ship .
The fireball causes the appendage to drop her , and she is able to take the dead woman 's car and escape .
As she nears the Texas border she hears radio chatter instructing any survivors to head to Baton Rouge to evacuate , but also requesting the help of any able - bodied person in Houston .
At a crossroads , she pauses a moment before driving off towards Houston .
In the distance , two larger alien crafts can be seen in the sky .

PRODUCTION
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Production .
Section::::Development .
10 Cloverfield Lane originated from an " ultra low budget " spec script penned by Josh Campbell and Matt Stuecken , titled The Cellar .
The Tracking Board included the script in " The Hit List " of 2012 â€“ an annually published list of spec scripts written within the year that have impressed its voting members .
In 2012 , Paramount Pictures bought the script and commenced further development under Bad Robot Productions for Insurge Pictures , Paramount 's specialty label for films with a micro - budget .
When Bad Robot became involved , the film was assigned the codename Valencia to keep exact details of the production a secret .
Damien Chazelle was brought in to rewrite Campbell and Stuecken 's draft and direct the film .
Chazelle dropped out from directing when his Whiplash project received funding .
On April 3 , 2014 , it was reported production for Valencia was greenlit to begin in the fall of 2014 , under the direction of Dan Trachtenberg with the latest draft being written by an uncredited Daniel Casey .
A budget of about $ 5 million was reported to be expected , in keeping with the mandate of Paramount 's Insurge division of producing micro - budgeted films .
On July 8 , 2014 , Variety reported John Goodman was in negotiations to star in the film .
On August 25 , 2014 , they reported Mary Elizabeth Winstead had entered negotiations , and on September 22 , 2014 , John Gallagher Jr. reportedly joined the cast .
During production , the filmmakers noticed core similarities to Cloverfield , and decided to make the picture what Abrams calls " a blood relative " or " spiritual successor " of that film .
" The spirit of it , the genre of it , the heart of it , the fear factor , the comedy factor , the weirdness factor , there were so many elements that felt like the DNA of this story were of the same place that Cloverfield was born out of , " said Abrams .
In other interviews he explained : " Those characters and that monster [ from Cloverfield ] are not in this movie , but there are other characters and other monsters , " and " This movie is very purposefully not called Cloverfield 2 , because it 's not Cloverfield 2 , [ ... ]
So if you 're approaching it as a literal sequel , you 'll be surprised to see what this movie is .
But while it 's not what you might expect from a movie that has the name Cloverfield in it , I think you 'll find that you 'll understand the connection when you see the whole thing . "
Winstead and Gallagher mentioned that during production they were aware that the film had thematic similarities to Cloverfield , but did not learn that there would be an official connection until they were informed of the chosen title , only a few days before the release of the trailer .
Abrams came up with the title after finishing .
In a March 2015 interview , a few months after production wrapped , Winstead was asked about her experience during Valencia and described it as a " really contained film " , reiterating the premise of The Cellar about a woman being trapped with her mysterious savior in a supposed post - nuclear fallout world .
Later in the month , Insurge Pictures was reported to have been dismantled and its staff absorbed by its parent company .
Insurge 's only film that had yet to be released was reported to be Valencia .
Speaking of rewrites that took place during production , Winstead called them " nothing that was major " .
During an interview with Abrams to promote 10 Cloverfield Lane , he said the creative team behind the original had some ideas on developing Cloverfield 2 , but the release of films such as Godzilla and Pacific Rim led them to abandon them as they found the concept of kaiju films played out .
