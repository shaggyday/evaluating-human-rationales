PGA PROFESSIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP
The PGA Professional Championship is a golf tournament for golf club professionals and teachers who are members of the Professional Golfers ' Association of America .
It has been held by the PGA of America since 1968 , when touring professionals split off to found the PGA Tour .
The PGA Professional Championship was known as the PGA Club Professional Championship until 2006 and as the PGA Professional National Championship from 2007 through 2015 .
Since 1997 , the tournament has usually been played in late June , six to seven weeks before the PGA Championship in mid - August .
Previously , the club pro tournament had been played in the fall , anywhere from late September to December , and its top 25 finishers qualified for the PGA Championship .
The number of qualifiers was reduced by five in 2006 to the top 20 finishers .
In 2019 , the tournament will move to April , four weeks before the Men 's PGA Championship .
To earn entry into the PGA Professional Championship , players must have PGA membership , be certified as PGA Professionals , and can not have more than ten combined starts on professional tours ( including various developmental tours , senior tours , and mini - tours ) during a preceding twelve month period , not counting majors .
Players earn entry by allocations from championships of their respective PGA sections or as the defending champions of the PGA Assistant Championship .
312 professionals representing the 41 sections of the PGA of America initially play in the field .
At the end of two rounds , the top 90 plus ties compete in round three .
After round three , the field is reduced to 70 plus ties .
At the end of 72 holes , if there is a tie for 20th place , a playoff occurs until exactly twenty advance to the PGA Championship .
The PGA Championship was originally the leading championship organized by the whole body of professionals , both club and touring .
This contrasts to the other three majors , two of which are organized by bodies controlled by golf 's amateur establishment , and the other run by a private club founded by a lifetime amateur .
Since 1968 , the PGA Championship has been run mainly for the top touring professionals , but unlike the other majors , it continues to reserve places for the club pros .
Sam Snead and Bob Rosburg are the only players to win a major championship and the PGA Professional Championship .
Bruce Fleisher and Larry Gilbert each would go on to win a senior major .
Several other winners have had PGA Tour careers , either before or after winning the championship .
The first edition in 1968 was held in early December in Scottsdale , Arizona .
The winner also earns $ 75,000 and six exemptions into the PGA Tour for the next season , three of which must be opposite The Open Championship or World Golf Championship events .
The top five finishers are also given entry into the second round of the Web.com Tour Qualifying Tournament .
Although the event gives invitations to the men 's PGA event , women are eligible to compete .
Those who have made the 36-hole cut are Suzy Whaley ( 2005 ) and Karen Paolozzi ( 2016 ) .
Paolozzi placed inside the top 20 in 2016 , but was not given entry due to the " Whaley Rule , " where women must play from the same tees as the men during both the sectional and national tournaments .
The Women 's PGA Championship ( formerly the LPGA Championship ) was established in 2015 and awarded entry to the top eight finishers of the LPGA T&CP
( Teaching and Club Professional )
National Championship .
It is unknown with the transfer if the PGA of America will allow women to earn an entry into the Women 's PGA .
