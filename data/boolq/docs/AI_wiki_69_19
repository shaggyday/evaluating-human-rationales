LIST OF SOVEREIGN STATES
The following is a list providing an overview of sovereign states around the world , with information on their status and recognition of their sovereignty .
Membership within the United Nations system divides the 206 listed states into three categories : 193 member states , 2 observer states , and 11 other states .
The sovereignty dispute column indicates states whose sovereignty is undisputed ( 191 states ) and states whose sovereignty is disputed ( 15 states , out of which there are 5 member states , 1 observer state and 9 other states ) .
Compiling a list such as this can be a difficult and controversial process , as there is no definition that is binding on all the members of the community of nations concerning the criteria for statehood .
For more information on the criteria used to determine the contents of this list , please see the criteria for inclusion section below .
The list is intended to include entities that have been recognized to have de facto status as sovereign states , and inclusion should not be seen as an endorsement of any specific claim to statehood in legal terms .

The dominant customary international law standard of statehood is the declarative theory of statehood , which was codified by the Montevideo Convention of 1933 .
The Convention defines the state as a person of international law if it " possess[es ]
the following qualifications : ( a ) a permanent population ; ( b ) a defined territory ; ( c ) government ; and ( d ) a capacity to enter into relations with the other states " so long as it was not " obtained by force whether this consists in the employment of arms , in threatening diplomatic representations , or in any other effective coercive measure " .
Debate exists on the degree to which recognition should be included as a criterion of statehood .
The declarative theory of statehood argues that statehood is purely objective and recognition of a state by other states is irrelevant .
On the other end of the spectrum , the constitutive theory of statehood defines a state as a person under international law only if it is recognised as sovereign by other states .
For the purposes of this list , included are all states that either : * ( a ) consider themselves sovereign ( through a declaration of independence or some other means ) and are often regarded as satisfying the declarative theory of statehood , or * ( b ) are recognised as a sovereign state by at least one UN member state
Note that in some cases , there is a divergence of opinion over the interpretation of the first point , and whether an entity satisfies it is disputed .
Unique political entities which fail to meet the classification of a sovereign state are considered proto - states .
On the basis of the above criteria , this list includes the following 206 entities : * 203 states recognised by at least one UN member state
* Two states that satisfy the declarative theory of statehood and are recognised only by non - UN member states : Artsakh , Transnistria * One state that satisfies the declarative theory of statehood and is not recognised by any other state : Somaliland
The table includes bullets representing entities which are either not sovereign states or have a close association to another sovereign state .
It also includes subnational areas where the sovereignty of the titular state is limited by an international agreement .
Taken together , these include : * States in a free association relationship to another state
* Two entities controlled by Pakistan which are neither sovereign states , dependent territories , or part of another state :
Azad Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan
* Dependent territories of another state , as well as areas that exhibit many characteristics of dependent territories according to the dependent territory page * Subnational entities created by international agreements SEE ALSO
