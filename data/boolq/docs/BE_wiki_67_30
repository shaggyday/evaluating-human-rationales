RELATIVE CLAUSE
A relative clause is a kind of subordinate clause that contains the element whose interpretation is provided by an antecedent on which the subordinate clause is grammatically dependent ; that is , there is an anaphoric relation between the relativized element in the relative clause and antecedent on which it depends .
Typically , a relative clause modifies a noun or noun phrase , and uses some grammatical device to indicate that one of the arguments within the relative clause has the same referent as that noun or noun phrase .
For example , in the sentence I met a man who was n't there , the subordinate clause who was n't there is a relative clause , since it modifies the noun man , and uses the pronoun who to indicate that the same " man " is referred to within the subordinate clause ( in this case , as its subject ) .
In many European languages , relative clauses are introduced by a special class of pronouns called relative pronouns , such as who in the example just given .
In other languages , relative clauses may be marked in different ways : they may be introduced by a special class of conjunctions called relativizers ; the main verb of the relative clause may appear in a special morphological variant ; or a relative clause may be indicated by word order alone .
In some languages , more than one of these mechanisms may be possible .
TYPES BOUND AND FREE Section::::Types .
Section::::Bound and free .
A bound relative clause , the type most often considered , qualifies an explicit element ( usually a noun or noun phrase ) appearing in the main clause , and refers back to that element by means of some explicit or implicit device within the relative clause .
The relative clause may also function as an embedded clause within a main ( or higher - level ) clause , thereby forming a matrix sentence .
The noun in the main clause that the relative clause modifies is called the head noun , or ( particularly when referred back to by a relative pronoun ) the antecedent .
For example , in the English sentence " The man whom I saw yesterday went home " , the relative clause " whom I saw yesterday " modifies the head noun man , and the relative pronoun whom refers back to the referent of that noun .
The sentence is equivalent to the following two sentences : " I saw a man yesterday .
The man went home . "
Note that the shared argument need not fulfill the same role in both clauses ; in this example the same man is referred to by the subject of the matrix clause , but the direct object of the relative clause .
A free relative clause , on the other hand , does not have an explicit antecedent external to itself .
Instead , the relative clause itself takes the place of an argument in the matrix clause .
For example , in the English sentence " I like what I see " , the clause what I see is a free relative clause , because it has no antecedent , but itself serves as the object of the verb like in the main clause .
( An alternative analysis is that the free relative clause has zero as its antecedent . )
RESTRICTIVE AND NON - RESTRICTIVE
Section::::Restrictive and non - restrictive .
Bound relative clauses may or may not be restrictive .
Whereas a non - restrictive or non - defining relative clause merely provides supplementary information , a restrictive or defining relative clause modifies the meaning of its head word ( restricts its possible referent ) .
For example : * The man who lives in this house has not been seen for days .
This ( who lives in this house ) is a restrictive relative clause , modifying the meaning of man , and essential to the sentence ( if the clause were omitted , it would no longer be known which man is being referred to ) .
If the bold part is deleted the remaining part does not provide the sense .
*
The mayor , who lives in this house , has not been seen for days .
This is a non - restrictive relative clause , since it provides supplementary information about the mayor , but is not essential to the sentence – if the clause were omitted , it would still be known which mayor is meant .
If the bold part is deleted the remaining part provides the sense .
In speaking it is natural to make slight pauses around non - restrictive clauses , and in English this is shown in writing by commas ( as in the examples ) .
However many languages do not distinguish the two types of relative clause in this way .
Another difference in English is that only restrictive relative clauses may be introduced with that or use the " zero " relative pronoun ( see English relative clauses for details ) .
In colloquial speech , a non - restrictive relative clause may have a whole sentence as its antecedent rather than a specific noun phrase ; for example : * The cat was allowed on the bed , which annoyed the dog .
Here , the context of the sentence ( presumably ) indicates that which refers not to the bed or the cat but to the entire proposition expressed in the main clause , namely the circumstance that the cat was allowed on the bed .
Such constructions are discouraged in formal usage and in texts written for nonnative speakers because of the potential for ambiguity in parsing ; a construction more accepted in formal usage would be The cat 's being [ or having been ] allowed on the bed annoyed the dog .
FINITE AND NON - FINITE
Section::::Finite and non - finite .
Relative clauses may be either finite clauses ( as in the examples above ) or non - finite clauses .
An example of a non - finite relative clause in English is the infinitive clause on whom to rely , in the sentence
" She is the person on whom to rely " .
FORMATION METHODS Section::::Formation methods .
Languages differ in many ways in how relative clauses are expressed : * How the role of the shared noun phrase is indicated in the embedded clause .
*
* How the two clauses are joined together .
*
* Where the embedded clause is placed relative to the head noun ( in the process indicating which noun phrase in the main clause is modified ) .
*
For example , the English sentence " The man that I saw yesterday went home
" can be described as follows : *
The role of the shared noun in the embedded clause is indicated by gapping ; that is , a gap is left in the object position after " saw " , implying that the shared noun phrase ( " the man " ) is to be understood to fill that gap and to serve as the object of the verb " saw " .
*
* The clauses are joined by the complementizer "
that " .
*
* The embedded clause is placed after the head noun " the man " .
*
The following sentences indicate various possibilities ( only some of which are grammatical in English ) : * " The man [ that I saw yesterday ] went home " .
( A complementizer linking the two clauses with a gapping strategy indicating the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause .
One possibility in English .
Very common cross - linguistically . )
*
" The man
[ I saw yesterday ] went home " .
( Gapping strategy , with no word joining the clauses — also known as a reduced relative clause .
One possibility in English .
Used in Arabic when the head noun is indefinite , as in " a man " instead of " the man " . )
* " The man [ whom I saw yesterday ] went home " .
( A relative pronoun indicating the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause — in this case , the direct object .
Used in formal English , as in Latin , German or Russian . )
*
" The man [ seen by me yesterday ] went home " .
( A reduced relative clause , in this case passivized .
One possibility in English . )
*
" The man [ that I saw him yesterday ] went home " .
( A complementizer linking the two sentences with a resumptive pronoun indicating the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause , as in Arabic , Hebrew or Persian . )
*
" The man [ that him I saw yesterday ] went home " .
( Similar to the previous , but with the resumptive pronoun fronted .
This occurs in modern Greek and as one possibility in modern Hebrew ; the combination that him of complementizer and resumptive pronoun behaves similar to a unitary relative pronoun . )
* " The [ I saw yesterday ] 's
man went home " .
( Preceding relative clause with gapping and use of a possessive particle — as normally used in a genitive construction — to link the relative clause to the head noun .
This occurs in many Sino - Tibetan languages and possibly developed from " relative clause + noun " > " nominalized clause + noun " > " genitive construction " . )
* " The [ I saw yesterday ]
man went home " .
( Preceding relative clause with gapping and no linking word , as in Japanese . )
*
" The man [ of my seeing yesterday ] went home " .
( Nominalized relative clause , as in Turkish . )
*
" [ Which man I saw yesterday ] , that man went home " .
( A correlative structure , as in Hindi . )
*
"
[ I saw the man yesterday ] went home . "
( An unreduced , internally headed relative clause , as in Tibetan or Navajo . )
STRATEGIES FOR INDICATING
THE ROLE OF THE SHARED NOUN IN THE RELATIVE
CLAUSE Section::::Strategies for indicating the role of the shared noun in the relative clause .
There are four main strategies for indicating the role of the shared noun phrase in the embedded clause .
These are typically listed in order of the degree to which the noun in the relative clause has been reduced , from most to least : * Gap strategy or gapped relative clause *
* Relative pronoun
* * Pronoun retention
* * Nonreduction * GAPPED RELATIVE CLAUSE
Section::::Gapped relative clause .
In this strategy , there is simply a gap in the relative clause where the shared noun would go .
This is normal in English , for example , and also in Chinese and Japanese .
This is the most common type of relative clause , especially in verb - final languages with prenominal relative clauses , but is also widespread among languages with postnominal externally headed relative clauses .
There may or may not be any marker used to join the relative and main clauses .
( Note that languages with a case - marked relative pronoun are technically not considered to employ the gapping strategy even though they do in fact have a gap , since the case of the relative pronoun indicates the role of the shared noun . )
Often the form of the verb is different from that in main clauses and is to some degree nominalized , as in Turkish and in English reduced relative clauses .
In non - verb - final languages , apart from languages like Thai and Vietnamese with very strong politeness distinctions in their grammars , gapped relative clauses tend , however , to be restricted to positions high up in the accessibility hierarchy .
With obliques and genitives , non - verb - final languages that do not have politeness restrictions on pronoun use tend to use pronoun retention .
English is unusual in that all roles in the embedded clause can be indicated by gapping : e.g. " I saw the man who is my friend " , but also ( in progressively less accessible positions cross - linguistically , according to the accessibility hierarchy described below ) " ... who I know " , " ... who I gave a book to " , " ... who I spoke with " , " ... who I run slower than " .
Usually , languages with gapping disallow it beyond a certain level in the accessibility hierarchy , and switch to a different strategy at this point .
Classical Arabic , for example , only allows gapping in the subject and sometimes the direct object ; beyond that , a resumptive pronoun must be used .
Some languages have no allowed strategies at all past a certain point — e.g .
in many Austronesian languages , such as Tagalog , all relative clauses must have the shared noun serving the subject role in the embedded clause .
In these languages , relative clauses with shared nouns serving " disallowed " roles can be expressed by passivizing the embedded sentence , thereby moving the noun in the embedded sentence into the subject position .
This , for example , would transform " The man who I gave a book to " into " The man who was given a book by me " .
Generally , languages such as this " conspire " to implement general relativization by allowing passivization from all positions — hence a sentence equivalent to " The man who is run slower than by me " is grammatical .
Note also that gapping is often used in conjunction with case - marked relative pronouns ( since the relative pronoun indicates the case role in the embedded clause ) , but this is not necessary ( e.g. Chinese and Japanese both using gapping in conjunction with an indeclinable complementizer ) .
RELATIVE PRONOUN TYPE Section::::Relative pronoun type .
This is in fact a type of gapped relative clause , but is distinguished by the fact that the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause is indicated indirectly by the case marking of the marker ( the relative pronoun ) used to join the main and embedded clauses .
All languages which use relative pronouns have them in clause - initial position : though one could conceivably imagine a clause - final relative pronoun analogous to an adverbial subordinator in that position , they are unknown .
Note that some languages have what are described as " relative pronouns "
( in that they agree with some properties of the head noun , such as number and gender ) but which do not actually indicate the case role of the shared noun in the embedded clause .
Classical Arabic in fact has " relative pronouns " which are case - marked , but which agree in case with the head noun .
Case - marked relative pronouns in the strict sense are almost entirely confined to European languages , where they are widespread except among the Celtic family and Indo - Aryan family .
The influence of Spanish has led to their adaption by a very small number of Native American languages , of which the best - known are the Keresan languages .
PRONOUN RETENTION TYPE Section::::Pronoun retention type .
In this type , the position relativized is indicated by means of a personal pronoun in the same syntactic position as would ordinarily be occupied by a noun phrase of that type in the main clause — known as a resumptive pronoun .
It is equivalent to saying " The man who I saw him yesterday went home " .
Pronoun retention is very frequently used for relativization of inaccessible positions on the accessibility hierarchy .
In Persian and Classical Arabic , for example , resumptive pronouns are required when the embedded role is other than the subject or direct object , and optional in the case of the direct object .
Resumptive pronouns are common in non - verb - final languages of Africa and Asia , and also used by the Celtic languages of northwest Europe and Romanian ( " Omul pe care l - am văzut ieri a mers acasă"/"The man who I saw him yesterday went home " ) .
They also occur in deeply embedded positions in English , as in " That 's the girl that I do n't know what she did " , although this is sometimes considered non - standard .
Only a very small number of languages , of which the best known is Yoruba , have pronoun retention as their sole grammatical type of relative clause .
NONREDUCTION TYPE Section::::Nonreduction type .
In the nonreduction type , unlike the other three , the shared noun occurs as a full - fledged noun phrase in the embedded clause , which has the form of a full independent clause .
Typically , it is the head noun in the main clause that is reduced or missing .
Some languages use relative clauses of this type with the normal strategy of embedding the relative clause next to the head noun .
These languages are said to have internally headed relative clauses , which would be similar to the ( ungrammatical ) English structure "
[ You see the girl over there ]
is my friend " or
" I took [ you see the girl over there ] out on a date " .
This is used , for example , in Navajo , which uses a special relative verb ( as with some other Native American languages ) .
A second strategy is the correlative - clause strategy used by Hindi and other Indo - Aryan languages , as well as Bambara .
This strategy is equivalent to saying " Which girl you see over there , she is my daughter " or " Which knife
I killed my friend with , the police found that knife " .
It is " correlative " because of the corresponding " which ... that ... " demonstratives or " which ... she /
he / it ...
" pronouns , which indicate the respective nouns being equated .
Note that the shared noun can either be repeated entirely in the main clause or reduced to a pronoun .
Note also that there is no need to front the shared noun in such a sentence .
For example , in the second example above , Hindi would actually say something equivalent to " I killed my friend with which knife , the police found that knife " .
Dialects of some European languages , such as Italian , do use the nonreduction type in forms that could be glossed in English as " The man just passed us by , he introduced me to the chancellor here . "
In general , however , nonreduction is restricted to verb - final languages , though it is more common among those that are head - marking .
STRATEGIES FOR JOINING THE RELATIVE CLAUSE TO THE MAIN CLAUSE Section::::Strategies for joining the relative clause to the main clause .
The following are some of the common strategies for joining the two clauses :
* Use of an indeclinable particle ( specifically , a relativizer ) inserted into the sentence , placed next to the modified noun ; the embedded clause is likewise inserted into the appropriate position , typically placed on the other side of the complementizer .
This strategy is very common and arguably occurs in English with the word that ( " the man that I saw " ) , though this interpretation of " that " as something other than a relative pronoun is controversial ( see below ) .
In the modern varieties of Arabic ( using illi placed after the modified noun ) ; in Chinese ( using de placed before the modified noun ) .
* Use of a relative pronoun .
Prototypically , a relative pronoun agrees with the head noun in gender , number , definiteness , animacy , etc . , but adopts the case that the shared noun assumes in the embedded , not matrix , clause .
This is the case in a number of conservative European languages , such as Latin , German and Russian .
Many languages also have similar linking words commonly termed " relative pronouns " that agree in some way with the head noun , but do not adopt the case role of the embedded clause .
In English , for example , the use of who vs. which agrees with the animacy of the head noun , but there is no case agreement except in the formal English contrast who vs. whom ( which is often used incorrectly , if at all , in speech ) .
Similarly , in Classical Arabic , there is a relative pronoun that agrees in number , gender , definiteness and case with the head noun ( rather than taking the case role of the noun in the embedded clause ) .
Languages with prototypical relative pronouns typically use the gapping strategy for indicating the role in the embedded clause , since the relative pronoun itself indicates the role by its case .
( Classical Arabic , where the case marking indicates something else , uses a resumptive pronoun . )
Some linguists prefer to use the term relative pronoun only for the prototypical cases ( but in this case it 's unclear what to call the non - prototypical cases ) .
* Directly inserting the embedded clause in the matrix clause at the appropriate position , with no word used to join them .
This is common , for example , in English ( cf .
" The man I saw yesterday went home " ) , and is used in Classical Arabic in relative clauses that modify indefinite nouns .
*
By nominalizing the relative clause ( e.g. converting it to a participial construction ) .
Generally , no relative pronoun or complementizer is used .
This occurs , for example , in reduced relative clauses in English ( e.g. " The man seen by me yesterday went home " or " The man planning to go home soon is my friend " ) .
Formal German makes common use of such participial relative clauses , which can become extremely long .
This is also the normal strategy in Turkish , which has sentences equivalent to " I ate the potato of Hasan 's giving to Sina " ( in place of " I ate the potato that Hasan gave to Sina " ) .
Note that this can be viewed as a situation in which the " complementizer " is attached to the verb of the embedded clause ( e.g. in English , " -ing " or " -ed " can be viewed as a type of complementizer ) .
POSITION OF THE HEAD
NOUN WITH RESPECT TO THE RELATIVE CLAUSE Section::::Position of the head noun with respect to the relative clause .
The positioning of a relative clause before or after a head noun is related to the more general concept of branching in linguistics .
Languages that place relative clauses after their head noun ( so - called head - initial or VO languages ) generally also have adjectives and genitive modifiers following the head noun , as well as verbs preceding their objects .
French , Spanish and Arabic are prototypical languages of this sort .
Languages that place relative clauses before their head noun ( so - called head - final or OV languages ) generally also have adjectives and genitive modifiers preceding the head noun , as well as verbs following their objects .
Turkish and Japanese are prototypical languages of this sort .
Not all languages fit so easily into these categories .
English , for example , is generally head - first , but has adjectives preceding their head nouns , and genitive constructions with both preceding and following modifiers ( " the friend of my father " vs. " my father 's friend " ) .
Chinese has the VO order , with verb preceding object , but otherwise is generally head - final .
Various possibilities for ordering are : * Relative clause following the head noun , as in English , French or Arabic .
* Relative clause preceding the head noun , as in Turkish , Japanese , or Chinese .
* Head noun within the relative clause ( an internally headed relative clause ) .
An example of such a language is Navajo .
These languages are said to have nonreduced relative clauses .
These languages have a structure equivalent to " [ I saw the man yesterday ] went home " .
* Adjoined relative clause .
These languages have the relative clause completely outside the main clause , and use a correlative structure to link the two .
These languages also have nonreduced relative clauses .
Hindi is the most well known such language , and have a structure similar to " Which man I saw yesterday , that man went home " or ( with non - fronting of the relativized noun in the relative clause )
" I saw which man yesterday , that man went home " .
Another example is Warlpiri , which constructs relative clauses of a form similar to " I saw the man yesterday , which he was going home " .
However , it is sometimes said these languages have no relative clauses at all , since the sentences of this form can equally well translate as " I saw the man who was going home yesterday " or " I saw the man yesterday when / while he was going home " .
ACCESSIBILITY HIERARCHY Section::::Accessibility hierarchy .
The antecedent of the relative clause ( that is , the noun that is modified by it ) can in theory be the subject of the main clause , or its object , or any other verb argument .
In many languages , however , especially rigidly left - branching , dependent - marking languages with prenominal relative clauses , there are major restrictions on the role the antecedent may have in the relative clause .
Edward Keenan and Bernard Comrie noted that these roles can be ranked cross - linguistically in the following order from most accessible to least accessible : Ergative – absolutive languages have a similar hierarchy :
This order is called the accessibility hierarchy .
If a language can relativize positions lower in the accessibility hierarchy , it can always relativize positions higher up , but not vice versa .
For example , Malagasy can relativize only subject and Chukchi only absolutive arguments , whilst Basque can relativize absolutives , ergatives and indirect objects , but not obliques or genitives or objects of comparatives .
Similar hierarchies have been proposed in other circumstances , e.g. for pronominal reflexes .
English can relativize all positions in the hierarchy .
Here are some examples of the NP and relative clause usage from English : !
Position ! !
With explicit relative pronoun ! !
With omitted relative pronoun ! !
In formal English Subject That 's the man [ who ran away ] .
—
That 's the man [ who ran away ] .
Direct object
That 's the man [ who I saw yesterday ] .
That 's the man
[ I saw yesterday ] .
That 's the man [ whom I saw yesterday ] .
Indirect object
That 's the man [ who I gave the letter to ] .
That 's the man
[ I gave the letter to ] .
That 's the man [ to whom I gave the letter ] .
Oblique
That 's the man [ who I was talking about ] .
That 's the man
[ I was talking about ] .
That 's the man [ about whom I was talking ] .
Genitive
That 's the man [ whose sister I know ] .
—
That 's the man [ whose sister I know ] .
Obj of Comp
That 's the man [ who I am taller than ] .
That 's the man
[ I am taller than ] .
That 's the man [ than whom I am taller ] .
Some other examples : !
Position ! !
Example Subject
The girl [ who came late ] is my sister .
Direct object
I gave a rose to the girl [ that Kate saw ] .
Indirect object
John knows the girl
[ I wrote a letter to ] .
Oblique
I found the rock [ which the robbers had hit John over the head with ] .
Genitive
The girl [ whose father died ] told me she was sad .
Obj of Comp
The first person [ I ca n't run faster than ] will win a million dollars .
Languages that can not relativize directly on noun phrases low in the accessibility hierarchy can sometimes use alternative voices to " raise " the relevant noun phrase so that it can be relativized .
The most common example is the use of applicative voices to relativize obliques , but in such languages as Chukchi antipassives are used to raise ergative arguments to absolutive .
For example , a language that can relativize only subjects could say this : *
The girl [ who likes me ] came to visit .
But not :
* The girl [ whom I like ] came to visit .
* The girl [ whom I gave a rose to ] came to visit .
*
The girl [ whom I watched a movie with ] came to visit .
*
The girl [ whose father I know ] came to visit .
* The girl [ whom I know the father of ] came to visit .
( equivalent to previous )
* The girl [ whom I am taller than ] came to visit .
These languages might form an equivalent sentence by passivization : * The girl [ who was liked by me ] came to visit .
*
The girl [ who was given a rose by me ] came to visit .
*
The girl [ who was watched a movie with by me ] came to visit .
*
The girl [ who was known the father of by me ] came to visit .
*
The girl [ who was been taller than by me ] came to visit .
Note that these passivized sentences get progressively more ungrammatical in English as they move down the accessibility hierarchy ; the last two , in particular , are so ungrammatical as to be almost unparsable by English speakers .
But languages with severe restrictions on which roles can be relativized are precisely those that can passivize almost any position , and hence the last two sentences would be normal in those languages .
A further example is languages that can relativize only subjects and direct objects .
Hence the following would be possible :
* The girl [ who I like ] came to visit .
The other ungrammatical examples above would still be ungrammatical .
These languages often allow an oblique object to be moved to the direct object slot by the use of the so - called applicative voice , much as the passive voice moves an oblique object to the subject position .
The above examples expressed in an applicative voice might be similar to the following ( in not necessarily grammatical English ) : * The girl [ who I gave a rose ] came to visit .
*
The girl [ who I with - watched a movie ] came to visit .
*
The girl [ who I ( of-)know the father ] came to visit .
*
The girl [ who I out - tall ] came to visit .
Modern grammars may use the accessibility hierarchy to order productions — e.g . in Head - Driven Phrase Structure Grammar the hierarchy corresponds to the order of elements on the subcat list , and interacts with other principles in explanations of binding facts .
The hierarchy also figures in Lexical Functional Grammar , where it is known as Syntactic Rank or the Relational Hierarchy .
EXAMPLES INDO - EUROPEAN LANGUAGES
ENGLISH Section::::Examples .
Section::::Indo - European languages .
Section::::English .
In English , a relative clause follows the noun it modifies .
It is generally indicated by a relative pronoun at the start of the clause , although sometimes simply by word order .
If the relative pronoun is the object of the verb in the relative clause , it comes at the beginning of the clause even though it would come at the end of an independent clause ( " He is the man whom I saw " , not " He is the man I saw whom " ) .
The choice of relative pronoun can be affected by whether the clause modifies a human or non - human noun , by whether the clause is restrictive or not , and by the role ( subject , direct object , or the like ) of the relative pronoun in the relative clause .
*
For a human antecedent , " who " , " whom " , or " that " is usually used ( " He is the person who saw me " , " He is the person whom I saw " , " He is the person that I saw " ) .
For a non - human antecedent , only " that " or " which " is used .
* For a non - human antecedent in a non - restrictive clause , only " which " is used ( " The tree , which fell , is over there " ) ; while either " which " or " that " may be used in a restrictive clause ( " The tree which fell is over there " , " The tree that fell is over there")but some styles and prescriptive grammars require the use of " that " in the restrictive context .
* Of the relative pronoun pair " who " and " whom " , the subjective case form ( " who " ) is used if it is the subject of the relative clause ( " He is the policeman who saw me " ) ; and , in formal usage , the objective case form ( " whom " ) if it is the object of the verb or preposition in the relative clause ( " He is the policeman whom I saw " , " He is the policeman whom I talked to " , " He is the policeman to whom I talked " ) ; but in informal usage " whom " is often replaced by " who " .
In English , as in some other languages ( such as French ; see below ) , non - restrictive relative clauses are set off with commas , but restrictive ones are not : *
" I met a man and a woman yesterday .
The woman , who had a thick French accent , was very pretty . "
( non - restrictive — does not narrow down who is being talked about )
*
" I met two women yesterday , one with a thick French accent and one with a mild Italian one .
The woman who had the thick French accent was very pretty . "
( restrictive — adds information about who is being referred to )
The status of " that " as a relative pronoun is not universally agreed .
Traditional grammars treat " that " as a relative pronoun , but not all contemporary grammars do : e.g. the Cambridge Grammar of the English Language ( pp .
1056–7 ) makes a case for treating " that " as a subordinator instead of a relative pronoun ; and the British National Corpus treats " that " as a subordinating conjunction even when it introduces relative clauses .
One motivation for the different treatment of " that " is that there are differences between " that " and " which " ( e.g. , one can say " in which " but not " in that " , etc . ) .
FRENCH Section::::French .
The system of relative pronouns in French is as complicated as , but similar in many ways to , the system in English .
When the pronoun is to act as the direct object of the relative clause , ' is generally used , although ' , which is inflected for grammatical gender and number , is sometimes used in order to give more precision .
For example , any of the following is correct and would translate to " I talked to his / her father and mother , whom I already knew " : However , in the first sentence , " whom I already knew " refers only to the mother ; in the second , it refers to both parents ; and in the third , as in the English sentence , it could refer either only to the mother , or to both parents .
When the pronoun is to act as the subject of the relative clause , ' is generally used , though as before , ' may be used instead for greater precision .
( This is less common than the use of with direct objects , however , since verbs in French often reflect the grammatical number of their subjects . )
Contrary to English , the relative pronoun can never be omitted in French , not even when the relative clause is embedded in another relative clause .
When the pronoun is to act in a possessive sense , where the preposition de ( of / from ) would normally be used , the pronoun ( " whose " ) is used , but does not act as a determiner for the noun " possessed " : This construction is also used in non - possessive cases where the pronoun replaces an object marked by :
More generally , in modern French , can signal the topic of the following clause , without replacing anything in this clause : When the pronoun is to act as the object of a preposition ( other than when ' is used ) , ' is generally used , though can be used if the antecedent is human .
There exists a further complication when the antecedent is a non - human indefinite pronoun .
In that case , ' can not be used because it must agree in gender with its head , and an indefinite pronoun has no gender .
Instead , ' , which usually means " what " , is used .
The same happens when the antecedent is an entire clause , also lacking gender .
The preposition always appears before the pronoun , and the prepositions ' and ' ( at / to ) contract with ' to form ' and ' , or with ' to form ' and ' . GERMAN Section::::German .
Aside from their highly inflected forms , German relative pronouns are less complicated than English .
There are two varieties .
The more common one is based on the definite article der , die , das , but with distinctive forms in the genitive ( dessen , deren ) and in the dative plural ( denen ) .
Historically this is related to English that .
The second , which is more literary and used for emphasis , is the relative use of welcher , welche , welches , comparable with English which .
As in most Germanic languages , including Old English , both of these varieties inflect according to gender , case and number .
They take their gender and number from the noun which they modify , but the case from their function in their own clause .
The relative pronoun dem is neuter singular to agree with Haus , but dative because it follows a preposition in its own clause .
On the same basis , it would be possible to substitute the pronoun welchem .
However , German uses the uninflecting was ( ' what ' ) as a relative pronoun when the antecedent is alles , etwas or nichts ( ' everything ' , ' something ' , ' nothing ' . ) .
In German , all relative clauses are marked with commas .
Alternatively , particularly in formal registers , participles ( both active and passive ) can be used to embed relative clauses in adjectival phrases : Unlike English , which only permits relatively small participle phrases in adjectival positions ( typically just the participle and adverbs ) , and disallows the use of direct objects for active participles , German sentences of this sort can embed clauses of arbitrary complexity .
SPANISH Section::::Spanish .
See Relative pronouns in the Spanish pronouns article .
LATIN Section::::Latin .
In Latin , relative clauses follow the noun phrases they modify , and are always introduced using relative pronouns .
Relative pronouns , like other pronouns in Latin , agree with their antecedents in gender and number , but not in case : a relative pronoun 's case reflects its role in the relative clause it introduces , while its antecedent 's case reflects the antecedent 's role in the clause that contains the relative clause .
( Nonetheless , it is possible for the pronoun and antecedent to be in the same case . )
For example : In the former example , urbēs and quae both function as subjects in their respective clauses , so both are in the nominative case ; and due to gender and number agreement , both are feminine and plural .
In the latter example , both are still feminine and plural , and urbēs is still in the nominative case , but quae has been replaced by quās , its accusative - case counterpart , to reflect its role as the direct object of vīdī .
For more information on the forms of Latin relative pronouns , see the section on relative pronouns in the article on Latin declension .
ANCIENT GREEK Section::::Ancient Greek .
Ancient Greek follows the same rule as Latin .
* αἱ πόλεις , ἃς εἶδον , μεγάλαι εἰσίν .
The Ancient Greek relative pronoun
ὅς , ἥ ,
ὅ ( hós , hḗ , hó ) is unrelated to the Latin word , since it derives from Proto - Indo - European : in Proto - Greek , y before a vowel usually changed to h ( debuccalization ) .
Cognates include Sanskrit yas , yā , yad ( where o changed to short a ) .
The Greek definite article ὁ , ἡ , τό ( ho , hē , tó ) has a different origin , since it is related to Sanskrit sa , sā and Latin is - tud .
Information that in English would be encoded with relative clauses could be represented with complex participles in Ancient Greek .
This was made particularly expressive by the rich suite of participles available , with active and passive participles in present , past and future tenses .
This is called the attributive participle SERBO - CROATIAN Section::::Serbo - Croatian .
Serbo - Croatian uses exactly the same principle as Latin does .
The following sentences are the Latin examples translated to Serbo - Croatian ( the same sentences apply to the Croatian , Serbian , Bosnian , and Montenegrin standard variants of the pluricentric language ) :
the cities : which : are : large : see : itself : the cities : which : I am :
saw : were : are : large :
In the first sentence , koji is in the nominative , and in the second koje is in the accusative .
Both words are two case forms of the same relative pronoun , that is inflicted for gender ( here : masculine ) , number ( here : plural ) , and case .
An alternative relativizing strategy is the use of the non - declinable word
što ' that ' to introduce a relative clause .
This word is used together with a resumptive pronoun , i.e. a personal pronoun that agrees in gender and number with the antecedent , while its case form depends on its function in the relative clause .
The resumptive pronoun never appears in subject function .
that : acquaintance : that be : him :
greet :
Relative clauses are relatively frequent in modern Serbo - Croatian since they have expanded as attributes at the expense of the participles performing that function .
The most frequently used relative pronoun is koji .
There are several ongoing changes concerning koji .
One of them is the spread of the genitive - accusative syncretism to the masculine inanimate of the pronoun .
The cause lies in the necessity to disambiguate the subject and the object by morphological means .
The nominative - accusative syncretism of the form koji is inadequate , so the genitive form kojeg is preferred : car : which : be : hit : bus : car : which : be : hit : bus : CELTIC LANGUAGES Section::::Celtic languages .
The Celtic languages ( at least the modern Insular Celtic languages ) distinguish two types of relative clause : direct relative clauses and indirect relative clauses .
A direct relative clause is used where the relativized element is the subject or the direct object of its clause ( e.g. " the man who saw me " , " the man whom I saw " ) , while an indirect relative clause is used where the relativized element is a genitival ( e.g. " the man whose daughter is in the hospital " ) or is the object of a preposition ( e.g. " the man to whom I gave the book " ) .
Direct relative clauses are formed with a relative pronoun ( unmarked for case ) at the beginning ; a gap ( in terms of syntactic theory , a trace , indicated by ( t ) in the examples below ) is left in the relative clause at the pronoun 's expected position .
Irish an fear
a chonaic ( t ) mé Welsh y dyn a welais
The direct relative particle " a " is not used with " mae " ( " is " ) in Welsh ; instead the form " sydd " or " sy ' " is used :
There is also a defective verb " piau " ( usually lenited to " biau " ) , corresponding to " who own(s ) " :
Indirect relative clauses are formed with a relativizer at the beginning ; the relativized element remains in situ in the relative clause .
Irish an fear a bhfuil a iníon san ospidéal Welsh y dyn y rhois y llyfr iddo
Note that although both the Irish relative pronoun and the relativizer are ' a ' , the relative pronoun triggers lenition of a following consonant , while the relativizer triggers eclipsis ( see Irish initial mutations ) .
Both direct and indirect relative particles can be used simply for emphasis , often in answer to a question or as a way of disagreeing with a statement .
For instance , the Welsh example above , " y dyn a welais " means not only " the man whom I saw " , but also " it was the man ( and not anyone else )
I saw " ; and " y dyn y rhois y llyfr iddo " can likewise mean " it was the man ( and not anyone else ) to whom I gave the book " .
SEMITIC LANGUAGES HEBREW Section::::Semitic languages .
Section::::Hebrew .
In Biblical Hebrew , relative clauses were headed with the word asher , which could be either a relative pronoun or a relativizer .
In later times , asher became interchangeable with the prefix she- ( which is also used as a conjunction , with the sense of English that ) , and in Modern Hebrew , this use of she- is much more common than asher , except in some formal , archaic , or poetic writing .
In meaning , the two are interchangeable ; they are used regardless of whether the clause is modifying a human , regardless of their grammatical case in the relative clause , and regardless of whether the clause is restrictive .
Further , because Hebrew does not generally use its word for is , she- is used to distinguish adjective phrases used in epithet from adjective phrases used in attribution : Since 1994 , the official rules of Modern Hebrew ( as determined by the Academy of the Hebrew Language ) have stated that relative clauses are to be punctuated in Hebrew the same way as in English ( described above ) .
That is , non - restrictive clauses are to be set off with commas , while restrictive clauses are not : Nonetheless , many , perhaps most , speakers of Modern Hebrew still use the pre-1994 rules , which were based on the German rules ( described above ) .
Except for the simple adjective - phrase clauses described above , these speakers set off all relative clauses , restrictive or not , with commas : One major difference between relative clauses in Hebrew and those in ( for example )
English is that in Hebrew , what might be called the " regular " pronoun is not always suppressed in the relative clause .
To reuse the prior example : More specifically , if this pronoun is the subject of the relative clause , it is always suppressed .
If it is the direct object , then it is usually suppressed , though it is also correct to leave it in .
( If it is suppressed , then the special preposition et , used to mark the direct object , is suppressed as well . )
If it is the object of a preposition , it must be left in , because in Hebrew — unlike in English — a preposition can not appear without its object .
When the pronoun is left in , she- might more properly be called a relativizer than a relative pronoun .
The Hebrew relativizer she- ' that ' " might be a shortened form of the Hebrew relativizer ' asher ' that ' , which is related to Akkadian ' ashru ' place ' ( cf .
Semitic * ' athar )
Alternatively , Hebrew ' asher derived from she- , or it was a convergence of Proto - Semitic dhu ( cf .
Aramaic dī ) and ' asher
[ ... ] Whereas Israeli she- functions both as complementizer and relativizer , ashér can only function as a relativizer . "
ARABIC LITERARY ARABIC Section::::Arabic .
Section::::Literary Arabic .
In Modern Standard and Classical Arabic there is a relative pronoun ( in Arabic : ) allaḏī ( masculine singular ) , feminine singular allatī , masculine plural allaḏīna , feminine plural allawātī ,
masculine dual allaḏānī ( nominative ) /
allaḏayni ( accusative and genitive ) , feminine dual allatānī ( nom . )
/ allataynī ( acc . and gen . ) .
Its usage has two specific rules : it agrees with the antecedent in gender , number and case , and it is used only if the antecedent is definite .
If the antecedent is indefinite , no relative pronoun is used .
The former is called jumlat sila ( conjunctive sentence ) while the latter is called jumlat sifa ( descriptive sentence ) .
COLLOQUIAL ARABIC Section::::Colloquial Arabic .
In Colloquial Arabic the multiple forms of the relative pronoun have been levelled in favour of a single form , a simple conjunction , which in most dialects is illi , and is never omitted .
So in Palestinian Arabic the above sentences would be : * alwalad illi shuftō fi ( a)ssaff
embārih ghāyeb alyōm
* hāda walad illi shuftō fi ( a)ssaff
embārih
As in Hebrew , the regular pronoun referring to the antecedent is repeated in the relative clause - literally , " the boy whom I saw him in class ...
" ( the -hu in ra'aituhu and the -ō in shuftō ) .
The rules of suppression in Arabic are identical to those of Hebrew : obligatory suppression in the case that the pronoun is the subject of the relative clause , obligatory retention in the case that the pronoun is the object of a preposition , and at the discretion of the speaker if the pronoun is the direct object .
The only difference from Hebrew is that , in the case of the direct object , it is preferable to retain the pronoun rather than suppress it .
JAPONIC LANGUAGES
JAPANESE Section::::Japonic languages .
Section::::Japanese .
Japanese does not employ relative pronouns to relate relative clauses to their antecedents .
Instead , the relative clause directly modifies the noun phrase as an attributive verb , occupying the same syntactic space as an attributive adjective ( before the noun phrase ) .
In fact , since so - called i - adjectives in Japanese are technically intransitive stative verbs , it can be argued that the structure of the first example ( with an adjective ) is the same as the others .
A number of " adjectival " meanings , in Japanese , are customarily shown with relative clauses consisting solely of a verb or a verb complex :
Often confusing to speakers of languages which use relative pronouns are relative clauses which would in their own languages require a preposition with the pronoun to indicate the semantic relationship among the constituent parts of the phrase .
Here , the preposition " in " is missing from the Japanese ( " missing " in the sense that the corresponding postposition would be used with the main clause verb in Japanese )
Common sense indicates what the meaning is in this case , but the " missing preposition " can sometimes create ambiguity .
In this case , ( 1 ) is the context - free interpretation of choice , but ( 2 ) is possible with the proper context .
Without more context , both ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are equally viable interpretations of the Japanese .
Note : Spaces are not ordinarily used in Japanese , but they are supplemented here to facilitate parsing by non - speakers of the language .
CAUCASIAN LANGUAGES GEORGIAN Section::::Caucasian languages .
Section::::Georgian .
In Georgian , there are two strategies for forming relative clauses .
The first is similar to that of English or Latin : the modified noun is followed by a relativizer that inflects for its embedded case and may take a postposition .
The relativized noun may be preceded by a determiner .
A second , more colloquial , strategy is marked by the invariant particle რომ rom .
This particle is generally the second word of the clause , and since it does not decline , is often followed by the appropriately cased third - person pronoun to show the relativized noun 's role in the embedded clause .
A determiner precedes the relativized noun , which is also usually preceded by the clause as a whole .
Such relative clauses may be internally headed .
In such cases , the modified noun moves into the clause , taking the appropriate declension for the its role therein ( thus eliminating the need for the third person pronouns in the above examples ) , and leaves behind the determiner ( which now functions as a pronoun ) in the matrix clause .
AUSTRONESIAN LANGUAGES
TAGALOG Section::::Austronesian languages .
Section::::Tagalog .
Tagalog uses the gapping strategy to form relative clauses , with the complementiser , na / = ng ' that ' , separating the head , which is the noun being modified , from the actual relative clause .
In ( 1a ) below , lalaki ' man ' serves as the head , while nagbigay ng bigas sa bata ' gave rice to the child ' is the relative clause .
The gap inside the relative clause corresponds to the position that the noun acting as the head would have normally taken , had it been in a declarative sentence .
In ( 1a ) , the gap is in subject position within the relative clause .
This corresponds to the subject position occupied by ang lalaki ' the man ' in the declarative sentence in ( 1b ) .
There is a constraint in Tagalog on the position from which a noun can be relativised and in which a gap can appear : A noun has to be the subject within the relative clause in order for it to be relativised .
The phrases in ( 2 ) are ungrammatical because the nouns that have been relativised are not the subjects of their respective relative clauses .
In ( 2a ) , the gap is in direct object position , while in ( 2b ) , the gap is in indirect object position .
The correct Tagalog translations for the intended meanings in ( 2 ) are found in ( 3 ) , where the verbs have been passivised in order to raise the logical direct object in ( 3a ) and the logical indirect object in ( 3b ) to subject position .
( Tagalog can have more than one passive voice form for any given verb . )
Tagalog relative clauses can be left - headed , as in ( 1a ) and ( 3 ) , right - headed , as in ( 4 ) , or internally headed , as in ( 5 ) .
In ( 4 ) , the head , lalaki ' man ' , is found after or to the right of the relative clause ,
nagbigay ng bigas sa bata ' gave rice to the child ' .
In ( 5 ) , the head is found in some position inside the relative clause .
Note that when the head appears to the right of or internally to the relative clause , the complementiser appears to the left of the head .
When the head surfaces to the left of the relative clause , the complementiser surfaces to the right of the head .
There are exceptions to the subjects - only constraint to relativisation mentioned above .
The first involves relativising the possessor of a noun phrase within the relative clause .
In ( 6 ) , the head , bata ' child ' , is the owner of the injured finger .
Note that ang daliri ' the finger ' is the subject of the verb , nasugatan ' was injured ' .
Another exception involves relativising the oblique noun phrase .
When an oblique noun phrase is relativised , as in ( 7a ) , na ' that ' , the complementiser that separates the head from the relative clause , is optional .
The relative clause itself is also composed differently .
In the examples in ( 1a ) , and in ( 3 ) to ( 6 ) , the relative clauses are simple declaratives that contain a gap .
However , the relative clause in ( 7a ) looks more like an indirect question , complete with the interrogative complementiser , kung ' if ' , and a pre - verbally positioned WH - word like saan ' where ' , as in ( 7b ) .
The sentence in ( 7c ) is the declarative version of the relative clause in ( 7a ) , illustrating where the head , ospital ' hospital ' , would have been " before " relativisation .
The question in ( 7d ) shows the direct question version of the subordinate indirect question in ( 7b ) .
HAWAIIAN Section::::Hawaiian .
Relative clauses in Hawaiian are avoided unless they are short .
If in English a relative clause would have a copula and an adjective , in Hawaiian the antecedent is simply modified by the adjective : " The honest man " instead of " the man who is honest " .
If the English relative clause would have a copula and a noun , in Hawaiian an appositive is used instead : " Paul , an apostle " instead of " Paul , who was an apostle " .
If the English relative pronoun would be the subject of an intransitive or passive verb , in Hawaiian a participle is used instead of a full relative clause : " the people fallen " instead of " the people who fell " ; " the thing given " instead of " the thing that was given " .
But when the relative clause 's antecedent is a person , the English relative pronoun would be the subject of the relative clause , and the relative clause 's verb is active and transitive , a relative clause is used and it begins with the relative pronoun nana : The one who me ( past ) sent = " the one who sent me " .
If in English a relative pronoun would be the object of a relative clause , in Hawaiian the possessive form is used so as to treat the antecedent as something possessed : the things of me to have seen = " the things that I saw " ; Here is theirs to have seen =
This is what they saw " .

CHINESE
MANDARIN Section::::Chinese .
Section::::Mandarin .
In Mandarin Chinese , the relative clause is similar to other adjectival phrases in that it precedes the noun that it modifies , and ends with the relative particle de .
If the relative clause is missing a subject but contains an object ( in other words , if the verb is transitive ) , the main - clause noun is the implied subject of the relative clause :
If the object but not the subject is missing from the relative clause , the main - clause noun is the implied object of the relative clause :
If both the subject and the object are missing from the relative clause , then the main - clause noun could either be the implied subject or the implied object of the relative clause ; sometimes which is intended is clear from the context , especially when the subject or object of the verb must be human and the other must be non - human :
But sometimes ambiguity arises when it is not clear from the context whether the main - clause noun is intended as the subject or the object of the relative clause :
However , the first meaning ( in which the main - clause noun is the subject ) is usually intended , as the second can be unambiguously stated using a passive voice marker :
Sometimes a relative clause has both a subject and an object specified , in which case the main - clause noun is the implied object of an implied preposition in the relative clause :
It is also possible to include the preposition explicitly in the relative clause , but in that case it takes a pronoun object ( a personal pronoun with the function of a relative pronoun ) :
Free relative clauses are formed in the same way , omitting the modified noun after the particle de .
As with bound relative clauses , ambiguity may arise ; for example , 吃的 chī de " eat ( particle ) " may mean " that which is eaten " , i.e. " food " , or " those who eat " .
CREOLES
HAWAIIAN CREOLE ENGLISH Section::::Creoles .
Section::::Hawaiian Creole English .
In Hawaiian Creole English , an English - based creole also called Hawaiian Pidgin or simply Pidgin , relative clauses work in a way that is similar to , but not identical to , the way they work in English .
As in English , a relative pronoun that serves as the object of the verb in the relative clause can optionally be omitted : For example , can also be expressed with the relative pronoun omitted , as However , relative pronouns serving as the subject of a relative clause show more flexibility than in English ; they can be included , as is mandatory in English , they can be omitted , or they can be replaced by another pronoun .
For example , all of the following can occur and all mean the same thing : GULLAH Section::::Gullah .
In Gullah , an English - based creole spoken along the southeastern coast of the United States , no relative pronoun is normally used for the subject of a relative clause .
