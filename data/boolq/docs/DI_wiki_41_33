ADVANCED MATERNAL AGE Advanced maternal age , in a broad sense , is the instance of a woman being of an older age at a stage of reproduction , although there are various definitions of specific age and stage of reproduction .
The variability in definitions is in part explained by the effects of increasing age occurring as a continuum rather than as a threshold effect .
In Western , Northern , and Southern Europe , first - time mothers are on average 27 to 29 years old , up from 23 to 25 years at the start of the 1970s .
In a number of European countries ( Spain ) , the mean age of women at first childbirth has crossed the 30 year threshold .
This process is not restricted to Europe .
Asia , Japan and the United States are all seeing average age at first birth on the rise , and increasingly the process is spreading to countries in the developing world like China , Turkey and Iran .
In the U.S. , the average age of first childbirth was 26 in 2013 .
Advanced maternal age is associated with adverse reproductive effects such as increased risk of infertility , and that the children have chromosomal abnormalities .
The corresponding paternal age effect is less pronounced .
In present generations it is more common to have children at an older age .
Several factors may influence the decisions of parents when having their first baby .
Such factors include educational , social and economic status .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Having children later was not exceptional in the past , when families were larger and women often continued bearing children until the end of their reproductive age .
What is so radical about this recent transformation is that it is the age at which women give birth to their first child which is becoming comparatively high , leaving an ever more constricted window of biological opportunity for second and subsequent children , should they be desired .
Unsurprisingly , high first - birth ages and high rates of birth postponement are associated with the arrival of low , and lowest - low fertility .
This association has now become especially clear , since the postponement of first births in a number of countries has now continued unabated for more than three decades , and has become one of the most prominent characteristics of fertility patterns in developed societies .
A variety of authors ( in particular Lesthaeghe ) have argued that fertility postponement constitutes the ' hallmark ' of what has become known as the second demographic transition .
Others have proposed that the postponement process itself constitutes a separate ' third transition ' .
On this latter view , modern developed societies exhibit a kind of dual fertility pattern , with the majority of births being concentrated either among very young or increasingly older mothers .
This is sometimes known as the ' rectangularisation ' of fertility patterns .
EXAMPLES Section::::Examples .
In the USA , the average age at which women bore their first child advanced from 21.4 years old in 1970 , to 25 years old in 2006 .
The German Federal Institute for Population Research claimed in 2015 the percentage for women with an age of at least 35 giving birth to a child was 25.9 % .
This figure rose from 7.6 % in 1981 .
POSSIBLE
FACTORS
THAT INFLUENCE
CHILDBEARING
AGE
Section::::Possible factors that influence childbearing age .
There are many factors that may influence childbearing age in women , although they are mostly correlations without certain causations .
Two studies show that generous parental leave allowances in Britain encourage young motherhood and that parental - leave allowance reduces postponement in Sweden .
EFFECTS DECREASED FERTILITY Section::::Effects .
Section::::Decreased fertility .
A woman 's fertility peaks lasts during the twenties and first half of thirties , after which it starts to decline , with advanced maternal age causing an increased risk of female infertility .
According to Henri Leridon , PhD , an epidemiologist with the French Institute of Health and Medical Research , of women trying to get pregnant , without using fertility drugs or in vitro fertilization :
*
At age 30 * 75 % will have a conception ending in a live birth within one year * 91 % will have a conception ending in a live birth within four years .
*
At age 35 * 66 % will have a conception ending in a live birth within one year * 84 % will have a conception ending in a live birth within four years .
*
At age 40 * 44 % will have a conception ending in a live birth within one year * 64 % will have a conception ending in a live birth within four years .
RISK OF BIRTH DEFECTS Section::::Risk of birth defects .
A woman 's risk of having a baby with chromosomal abnormalities increases with her age .
Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal birth defect , and a woman 's risk of having a baby with Down syndrome is : *
At age 20 , 1 in 1,441 *
At age 25 , 1 in 1,383 * At age 30 , 1 in 959 *
At age 35 , 1 in 338
*
At age 40 , 1 in 84 *
At age 45 , 1 in 32 * At age 50 , 1 in 44 OTHER EFFECTS Section::::Other effects .
Advanced maternal age is associated with adverse outcomes in the perinatal period , which may be caused by detrimental effects on decidual and placental development .
The risk of the mother dying before the child becomes an adult increases by more advanced maternal age , such as can be demonstrated by the following data from France in 2007 : !
Maternal age at childbirth !
Risk of mother not surviving until child 's 18th birthday ( in % )
Advanced maternal age continues to be associated with a range of adverse pregnancy outcomes including low birth weight , pre - term birth , stillbirth , unexplained fetal death , and increased rates of Caesarean section .
On the other hand , advanced maternal age is associated with a more stable family environment , higher socio - economic position , higher income and better living conditions , as well as better parenting practices , but it is more or less uncertain whether these entities are effects of advanced maternal age , are contributors to advanced maternal age , or common effects of a certain state such as personality type .
CHANGES IN INTERPREGNANCY INTERVAL
Section::::Changes in interpregnancy interval .
Kalberer et al . have shown that despite the older maternal age at birth of the first child , the time span between the birth of the first and the second child (= interpregnancy interval ) decreased over the last decades .
If purely biological factors were at work , it could be argued that interpregnancy interval should have increased , as fertility declines with age , which would make it harder for the woman to get a second child after postponed birth of the first one .
This not being the case shows that sociologic factors ( see above ) prime over biological factors in determining interpregnancy interval .
With technology developments cases of post - menopausal pregnancies have occurred , and there are several known cases of older women carrying a pregnancy to term , usually with in vitro fertilization of a donor egg .
A 61-year - old Brazilian woman with implantation of a donor egg expected gave birth to twins in October 2011 ..
OVARIAN AGING
Section::::Ovarian aging .
As women age , they experience a decline in reproductive performance leading to menopause .
This decline is tied to a decline in the number of ovarian follicles .
Although about 1 million oocytes are present at birth in the human ovary , only about 500 ( about 0.05 % ) of these ovulate , and the rest do not ( ovarian follicle atresia ) .
The decline in ovarian reserve appears to occur at a constantly increasing rate with age , and leads to nearly complete exhaustion of the reserve by about age 51 .
As ovarian reserve and fertility decline with age , there is also a parallel increase in pregnancy failure and meiotic errors resulting in chromosomally abnormal conceptions .
Titus et al . have proposed an explanation for the decline in ovarian reserve with age .
They showed that as women age , double - strand breaks accumulate in the DNA of their primordial follicles .
Primordial follicles are immature primary oocytes surrounded by a single layer of granulosa cells .
An enzyme system is present in oocytes that normally accurately repairs DNA double - strand breaks .
This repair system is referred to as homologous recombinational repair , and it is especially active during meiosis .
Meiosis is the general process by which germ cells are formed in eukaryotes , and it appears to be an adaptation for efficiently removing damages in germ line DNA by homologous recombinational repair ( see Origin and function of meiosis also ) .
Human primary oocytes are present at an intermediate stage of meiosis , that is prophase
I ( see Oogenesis ) .
Titus et al .
also showed that expression of four key DNA repair genes that are necessary for homologous recombinational repair ( BRCA1 , MRE11 , Rad51 and ATM ) decline in oocytes with age .
This age - related decline in ability to repair double - strand damages can account for the accumulation of these damages , which then likely contributes to the decline in ovarian reserve .
Women with an inherited mutation in the DNA repair gene BRCA1 undergo menopause prematurely , suggesting that naturally occurring DNA damages in oocytes are repaired less efficiently in these women , and this inefficiency leads to early reproductive failure .
Genomic data from about 70,000 women were analyzed to identify protein - coding variation associated with age at natural menopause .
Pathway analyses identified a major association with DNA damage response genes , particularly those expressed during meiosis and including a common coding variant in the BRCA1 gene .
