PORT SALUT Port Salut is a semi - soft pasteurised cow 's milk cheese from Pays de la Loire , France , with a distinctive orange rind and a mild flavour .
The cheese is produced in wheels approximately 23 cm ( 9 inches ) in diameter , weighing approximately .
Though Port Salut has a mild flavour , it sometimes has a strong smell because it is a mature cheese .
The smell increases the longer the cheese is kept — this however does not affect its flavour .
It can be refrigerated and is best eaten within two weeks of opening .
The cheese was developed by Trappist monks during the 19th century at Port - du - Salut Abbey in Entrammes .
The monks , many of whom had left France during the French revolution of 1789 , learned cheese - making skills to support themselves abroad , and brought those skills back upon their return after the Bourbon Restoration .
The name of their society , " Société Anonyme des Fermiers Réunis " ( S.A.F.R. ) , later became their registered trademark , and is still printed on the wheels of Port Salut cheese .
In 1873 , the head of the abbey came to an agreement with a Parisian cheese - seller granting exclusive rights of distribution , and the cheese soon became popular .
The abbey sought trade protection , and eventually ( in 1959 ) , sold the rights to a major creamery .
The cheese is now produced in a factory ; the characteristic smooth rind the result of a plastic - coated wrapper .
The rind is edible , but is made of wax and detracts from the flavour of the cheese .
Handmade Port Salut cheese or " Entrammes " cheese is still produced by various monasteries throughout the French countryside .
