NILE , WASHINGTON Nile is an unincorporated community in Yakima County , Washington , United States , located approximately 20 miles southwest of Ellensburg in the Nile Valley adjacent to the Naches River in the Nile Valley , near the mouth of Rattlesnake Creek
The community was established in the mid-1890s by families of James Beck , William Markle and Henry Sedge , who may have named the small valley and community Nile because of the area 's fertility thought to resemble that of the Nile River Valley in Egypt .
According to historian Gretta Gossett , " there is yet an alluvial plain along the river near Nile Creek which is often flooded in the spring and left with a layer of silt perhaps giving rise to the name for the Nile in Egypt . "
