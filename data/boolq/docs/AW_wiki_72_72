WE DIDN'T START THE FIRE
" We Did n't Start the Fire " is a song by American musician Billy Joel .
Its lyrics include brief , rapid - fire allusions to more than 100 headline events between 1949 , the year of Joel 's birth , and 1989 , when the song was released on his album Storm Front .
The song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Record of the Year .
The song was also a No . 1 hit in the United States in late 1989 .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Joel got the idea for the song when he had just turned 40 .
He was in a recording studio and met a friend of Sean Lennon who had just turned 21 who said " It 's a terrible time to be 21 ! "
Joel replied to him , " Yeah , I remember when I was 21
– I thought it was an awful time
and we had Vietnam , and y'know , drug problems , and civil rights problems and everything seemed to be awful .
"
The friend replied , "
Yeah , yeah ,
yeah ,
but it 's different for you .
You were a kid in the fifties and everybody knows that nothing happened in the fifties " .
Joel retorted , " Wait a minute , did n't you hear of the Korean War or the Suez Canal Crisis ? "
Joel later said those headlines formed the basic framework for the song .
Joel has said , " I 'm a history nut .
I devour books .
At one time I wanted to be a history teacher " .
According to his mother , he was a bookworm by the age of seven .
Unlike most of Joel 's songs , the lyrics were written before the melody , owing to the somewhat unusual style of the song .
The song was a huge commercial success and was Joel 's third Billboard No . 1 hit .
It was nominated for the Grammy Award for Record of the Year .
Joel has said , " There 's an element of malevolence in the song ; it 's like waiting for the other shoe to drop . "
He has mentioned having mixed feelings about the song .
" It 's a nightmare to perform live , because if I miss one word , it 's a train wreck .
" He has called it a " novelty song " that does not " really define me as well as album songs that probably do n't get played " , and has also criticized the song on strictly musical grounds .
In 1993 , when discussing it with documentary filmmaker David Horn , Joel compared its melodic content unfavorably to his song " The Longest Time " :
" Take a song like ' We Did n't Start the Fire . '
It 's really not much of a song ...
If you take the melody by itself , terrible .
Like a dentist drill . "
When asked if he deliberately intended to chronicle the Cold War with his song he responded , " It was just my luck that the Soviet Union decided to close down shop [ soon after putting out the song ] " , and that this span " had a symmetry to it , it was 40 years " that he had lived through .
He was asked if he could do a follow - up about the next couple of years after the events that transpired in the original song , he commented " No , I wrote one song already
and I do n't think it was really that good to begin with , melodically . "
MUSIC VIDEO Section::::Music video .
A music video for the single was directed by Chris Blum .
The video begins with a newly married couple entering their 1940s - style kitchen , and shows events in their domestic life over the next four decades , including the addition of children , their growth , and later , grandchildren , and the eventual death of the family 's father .
The passage of time is also depicted by periodic redecoration and upgrades of the kitchen , while an unchanging Billy Joel looks on in the background .
HISTORICAL EVENTS REFERRED TO IN THE SONG Section::::Historical events referred to in the song .
Though the lyrics are rapid - fire with several people and events mentioned in a single word each , there is widespread agreement on the meaning of the lyrics .
Steven Ettinger wrote , The following events ( with Joel 's lyric for each appearing in bold ) are listed in the order that they appear in the song , which is almost entirely chronological .
The lyric for each individual event is brief and the events are punctuated by the chorus and other lyrical elements .
