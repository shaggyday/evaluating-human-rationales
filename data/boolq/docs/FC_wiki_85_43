ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE
Administrative leave is a temporary leave from a job assignment , with pay and benefits intact .
Generally , the term is reserved for employees of non - business institutions such as schools , police , and hospitals .
The definition of administrative leave may vary by institution .
Individuals may also be eligible for administrative leave for various reasons including : bereavement , jury / court appearances , military leave , internal reviews , and investigations .
In academic settings , administrative leaves are provided for the same purpose as research / study leaves , i.e. , to allow individuals to improve themselves academically and to engage in research to foster their effectiveness as teachers and scholars .
An employee may be placed on administrative leave when an allegation of misconduct is made against an employee , either by a co - worker , student , parent , an alleged victim , or a police officer .
During the leave , employers may investigate the situation before determining an appropriate course of action .
Administrative leave does not in itself imply that an employee will be disciplined or that an allegation is credible , which is why pay and benefits are not discontinued .
It simply allows the employer to investigate the incident , maintaining the employee 's status while at the same time removing them from work , eventually leading to either their return or dismissal .
Police officers are routinely placed on administrative leave after a shooting incident while an investigation is conducted , without implying fault on the part of the officer .
Whistleblowers may also be placed on administrative leave as a way to protect them from potential harassment of a supervisor .
For example , if they report a case of research misconduct from the Principal Investigation of an academic project .
