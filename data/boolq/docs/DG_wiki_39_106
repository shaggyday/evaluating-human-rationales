HISTORY Section::::History .
Launched in the year 2000 , Sony 's second home console , the PlayStation 2 , had rudimentary online features in select games via its online network .
It required a network adaptor , which was available as an add - on for original models and integrated into the hardware on slimline models .
However , Sony provided no unified service for the system , so support for network features was specific to each game and third - party server , and there was no interoperability of cross - game presence .
Five years later during the development stage for its third home console , the PlayStation 3 , Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a " PlayStation World " network .
In March 2006 , Sony officially introduced its unified online service , tentatively named " PlayStation Network Platform " .
A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year .
Sony launched an optional premium subscription service on top of the free PSN service in June 2010 .
Known as PlayStation Plus , the system provides access to exclusive content , complimentary games , regular store discounts , and early access to forthcoming games .
Following a security intrusion , the PlayStation Network had a temporary suspension of operation which began on April 20 , 2011 and affected 77 million registered accounts .
Lasting 23 days , this outage was the longest amount of time the PSN had been offline since its inception in 2006 .
Sony reported that user data had been obtained during the intrusion .
In June 2011 , Sony launched a " Welcome Back " program following the outage , allowing all PSN subscribers who joined prior to April 20 to download two free PlayStation 3 titles and two free PlayStation Portable games .
Users also received 30 free days of PlayStation Plus , while users who were already subscribed before the outage got 60 free days .
After the disruption , Sony changed the PlayStation Network 's license agreement to legally bar users from filing lawsuits and joining class action lawsuits without first trying to resolve issues with an arbitrator .
In July 2012 , Sony Computer Entertainment announced that they had acquired video game streaming service Gaikai for $ 380 million .
The acquisition was later strengthened when Sony acquired the assets of Gaikai 's market rival OnLive .
At the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2014 , Sony announced that Gaikai 's technology would be used to power PlayStation Now ; a new cloud - based gaming service that allows people to play PlayStation games on a variety of devices .
During 2014 , Sony rolled out the service in North America on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 in beta form as a means for users to test performance and pricing structures .
On December 25 , 2014 , PlayStation Network and Xbox Live suffered network disruption after a denial - of - service attack .
Both services were flooded with millions of inauthentic connection requests , making it hard for genuine users to establish a connection .
Functionality was restored on December 26 , with some users experiencing difficulties in the days that followed .
On January 1 , 2015 , Sony announced that users would be compensated for the downtime with a 5-day extension to PlayStation Plus memberships .
Formerly the gaming provision of the much broader Sony Entertainment Network , the PlayStation Network became Sony 's premier entertainment service in 2015 , unifying games , music , television and video .
While synonymous with gaming , Sony said the PlayStation Network had evolved to become a " comprehensive digital entertainment brand " .
The SEN name is still used in some places .
USER INFORMATION Section::::User information .
Signing up to the PlayStation Network is free .
Two types of accounts can be created : Master accounts and Sub accounts .
A master account allows full access to all settings , including parental controls .
Sub accounts can subsequently be created ( e.g. for children ) with desired restrictions set by the master account holder .
A sub account holder has the option to upgrade their account once they reach 18 years of age .
Sony encourage registrants to use a unique email and strong password not associated with other online services .
ONLINE
ID Section::::Online ID .
An Online ID is one 's username on the PlayStation Network .
It can range from 3 to 16 characters in length and consist of letters , numbers , hyphens and underscores .
A user 's Online ID is central to your PSN profile and is displayed when playing online games and using other network features .
Users have the option to disclose their real name aside their Online ID , add a personal description , exhibit a profile picture or avatar , and list all spoken languages .
Profiles also include a summary of a player 's Trophy level and recent activity .
PlayStation 4 users have the additional option to tie a Facebook account to their PlayStation Network account , and their profile picture will automatically update whenever they change their Facebook picture .
Profiles can be viewed via the user interface or online through the PlayStation website .
A Portable ID is a small infographic intended for use as a forum signature .
The graphic showcases a user 's trophy level and number of trophies awarded .
Each user is able to log into their PSN account using a web browser to access and customize their Portable ID , and are then given a unique URL which they can cut & paste to display their ID elsewhere on the internet .
Several third - party websites offer similar graphics ( commonly referred to as " trophy cards " ) as both free and paid services which either update automatically or are updated manually by the user .
TROPHIES Section::::Trophies .
Trophies are
in - game awards presented to players for hitting specific targets or reaching certain milestones ( e.g. completing a difficult level or defeating a certain number of enemies ) .
There are four different types of trophy awarded .
A bronze , silver , or gold trophy is contingent upon the difficulty of the accomplishment , with each reward contributing to a level system attached to a player 's profile .
A platinum trophy is awarded to the player once they unlock all other trophies in the base game ; smaller sized games , however , generally do not have a platinum trophy .
In addition , each trophy is graded by popularity — common , rare , very rare , and ultra rare — based on the percentage of people who have unlocked it .
Developers can choose to make various trophies hidden so that its value and description are not revealed until after the user has obtained it .
