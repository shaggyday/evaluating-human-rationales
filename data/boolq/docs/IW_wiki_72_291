PRODUCTION
Section::::Production .
The series was announced by Disney on June 9 , 2014 , on the run up to the first film 's 20th anniversary .
Disney Junior general manager Nancy Kanter stated : " It 's kind of like The Lion King meets The Avengers . "
The series ' announcement came after a meeting between Kanter and Disney chief executive Robert Iger .
Iger suggested to Kanter that Disney Junior should consider producing content to celebrate the 20th anniversary of The Lion King in 2014 .
Disney had shown early footage to young test audiences , who were able to make suggestions , such as adjusting the look of the hyenas .
Disney Consumer Products launched a line of toys to tie into the television series , as well at book titles based on the series such as Return of the Roar , Ca n't Wait to be Queen , Bunga the Wise , Meet the New Guard , Fuli Finds Her Place , Join the Lion Guard !
and Kion 's Animal Alphabet .
A sneak peek of The Lion Guard was shown at the 2015 D23 Expo .
On August 12 , 2015 , a sneak peek was shown , with new information that the television movie was scheduled to air in November 2015 to be titled The Lion Guard : Return of the Roar .
On October 9 , 2015 , it was announced that Return of the Roar would premiere on November 22 , 2015 , on Disney Channel .
On coming up with the idea , the series ' creator and executive producer Ford Riley noted that in Kiara is introduced and will be future queen .
Riley was interested in the idea of a second - born cub and what his role would be if Kiara is destined to become queen .
Additionally , he was inspired by his 8-year - old son .
"
Every Thursday he and his buddies go to the park and they have this imaginary superhero team and they have all these imaginary adventures .
That 's when it hit me .
Let 's have a group of superheroes in the Pride Lands – The Avengers meets The Lion King ! "
Riley confirmed the timeline of the series ; in Simba 's Pride there is a years - long time gap , The Lion Guard takes place during the years in - between Kiara 's first meeting with Kovu as a cub and her first hunt as an adult .
Riley also noted the inclusion of Swahili into the series ; " [ W]e've actually hired Sarah Mirza , who literally wrote the book on English - Swahili translations .
We 've been using Swahili not just in names of characters and places but also in the language of the show itself . "
Classic mythology is used as inspiration for the show .
In reference to Return of the Roar , Riley noted ; " The whole laying on hands where Kion gives the mark of the guard to the rest of the team , that goes back to the Bible . "
Riley noted that protecting the Circle of Life is the main theme of the series ; " The animals who respect it do n't eat too much , allow for the grass to grow , and larger animals to eat smaller animals .
Our bad guys come from those that do n't respect the Circle of Life .
They just want to eat and wreak havoc . "
In terms of giving The Lion Guard the same look as the original film , director Howy Parkins stated that they were mindful to keep the essence of The Lion King .
To that end , the crew did extensive research on the look of the backgrounds and characters and were able to obtain some original model sheets .
In addition , Barry Atkinson and Mike Surrey , background painter and supervising animator for Timon on the original film respectively , were brought in to consult with the series ' background artists , animators and storyboard artists .
Speaking on the show 's educational aspect , Parkins stated that research was done on animals and habitats in the Serengeti , and that this information is woven into storylines without being overt .
