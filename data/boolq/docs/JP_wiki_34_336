" Perfect " was the first track Sheeran wrote for his third studio album ÷.
The song is a romantic ballad written about his girlfriend Cherry Seaborn , whom he knew from school and reconnected with when she was working in New York .
Sheeran revealed that the inspiration for the lyrics came after visiting James Blunt 's house in Ibiza , where the two singers had listened to the rapper Future 's music at six in the morning .
He said : " Barefoot on the grass , dancing to our favorite song , which happened to be Future 's " March Madness " ...
I booked the studio for the day , and I had that
and I was like ,
right , let me just flesh that out .
And the song happened and was sort of finished that day .
I knew it was special . "
In an interview with Zane Lowe , Sheeran said that he needed to write the best love song of his career with " Perfect " .
He said : " I need to do it 100 % me , so everyone will listen to that will be like , " Ah !
He can actually do it ! "

I wanted to beat " Thinking Out Loud " , 'cause I know that song was going to define me . "
