HIGHEST UNCLIMBED MOUNTAIN
An unclimbed mountain is a mountain peak that has yet to be climbed to the top .
Determining which unclimbed peak is highest is often a matter of controversy .
In some parts of the world , surveying and mapping are still unreliable , and there are no comprehensive records of the routes of explorers , mountaineers and local inhabitants .
In some cases , even modern ascents by larger parties have been poorly documented and , with no universally recognized listing , the best that can be achieved in determining the world 's highest unclimbed peaks is somewhat speculative .
Most sources indicate that Gangkhar Puensum ( ) in Bhutan or on the Bhutan - China border is the tallest mountain in the world that has yet to be fully summited .
Gangkhar Puensum has been off limits to climbers since 1994 when Bhutan prohibited all mountaineering above due to spiritual / religious beliefs .
Unclimbed mountains are sometimes referred to as " virgin peaks " .
Many virgin peaks exist because the mountain is unreachable , due to either geographic isolation or political instability .
Some mountains remain off limits due to religious beliefs of a country or region that hold such mountains are sacred and should remain inviolate .
Additionally , since the endeavor to scale taller mountains of the world is usually a major undertaking , lesser peaks , while still very formidable , simply get less attention than the taller ones , and instead these taller peaks are summited by parties following a new route or perhaps during the winter when conditions are generally more treacherous .
CHALLENGES IN DEFINITION DEFINITION OF A MOUNTAIN Section::::Challenges in definition .
Section::::Definition of a mountain .
Many mountains , in addition to their highest point or peak , will also have subsidiary subpeaks .
Generally , the topographic prominence of a peak or subpeak , as well as the general topography , all come into consideration when determining whether such apexes are considered to be independent peaks or subpeaks .
Although objective criteria have been proposed for distinguishing peaks from subpeaks , there is no widely agreed standard .
In 1994 , the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation ( UIAA ) classified 82 mountain peaks in the Alps whose summits were at least above sea level and with at least of topographic prominence over any adjacent mountain pass or col , as a distinct peak .
VERIFICATION OF UNCLIMBED
STATUS Section::::Verification of unclimbed status .
It can be difficult sometimes to determine whether or not a mountain peak has been fully summited .
Long before modern mountaineering commenced in the middle of the 19th century , evidence indicates that people did indeed travel up to the summits or near to the summits of major mountain peaks .
Archaeological excavations in the Andes have shown that humans travelled up to in pre - historic times .
Permanent settlements as high as were established as long as 12,000 years ago in the Andes as well .
In the Greater Himalaya region , Lhasa , in Tibet , sitting at has been permanently occupied since the 7th century and many smaller settlements across the Greater Himalaya thrive at elevations exceeding .
With humans living at high elevations for many millennia , nearby peaks to such settlements may or may not have been summited at some point in the past .
However , many regions away from settlements may have never before been explored , especially since some high peaks in the Greater Ranges are so remote that they were unknown to local inhabitants when first sighted by European explorers .
The world 's third tallest peak , Kangchenjunga , has been summited a number of times , but after the first climbers of the peak agreed to honor the wishes of locals and not set foot on the topmost part of the mountain , succeeding mountaineering parties may have followed this tradition .
Similarly , Nanda Devi has also been climbed but the topmost summit was not ascended and the primary summit is now off limits to climbers .
Machapuchare had only one summit attempt back in 1957 when climbers came within of the summit ; Nepal then banned future attempts .
GANGKHAR PUENSUM Section::::Gangkhar Puensum .
The mountain most widely claimed to be the highest unclimbed mountain in the world in terms of elevation is Gangkhar Puensum ( ) .
It is in Bhutan , on or near the border with China .
In Bhutan , the climbing of mountains higher than has been prohibited since 1994 .
The rationale for this prohibition is based on local customs that consider this and similar peaks to be the sacred homes of protective deities and spirits , and the lack of high - altitude rescue resources from any locale closer than India .
The prohibition was further expanded in 2003 when mountaineering of any kind was disallowed entirely within Bhutan .
Gangkhar Puensum will likely remain unclimbed so long as the government of Bhutan prohibits it .
HIGHEST UNCLIMBED NON - PROHIBITED
PEAK Section::::Highest unclimbed non - prohibited peak .
It is unclear which is the highest unclimbed non - prohibited mountain .
While some recognize only peaks with of topographical prominence as individual summits , the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation uses a as the cutoff for determining individual summits .
Based on the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation 's criteria , Muchu Chhish ( with a prominence of ) in Pakistan is currently the world 's tallest that has not been climbed even though it is legal to do so .
Other unclimbed summits include one on the massif known as Kabru ( prominence c. ) ,
Labuche Kang III / East ( )
with prominence of and Karjiang ( with a prominence of ) .
MOST PROMINENT UNCLIMBED PEAK Section::::Most prominent unclimbed peak .
Unclimbed candidates with high topographic prominence are by definition independent mountains , but some have relatively modest elevations .
With such peaks there is a greater possibility of undocumented ascents , perhaps occurring long ago .
Sauyr Zhotasy ( , prominence of ) , the highpoint in the Saur Range on the border between Kazakhstan and China , and Mount Siple ( , prominence of ) on Siple Island off the coast of Antarctica , have no record of successful ascents , but the unclimbed status of each of these peaks is difficult to confirm .
