Geek Squad technicians have been caught on numerous occasions searching and copying pornographic content stored on their clients ' computers without permission .
When asked about the incident , Geek Squad founder Robert Stephens refused to discuss the topic and focused on whether bloggers should be considered true journalists .
At least one former Geek Squad employee had come forward with allegations that the practice of surreptitiously searching for pornography on their clients ' computers is not restricted to isolated employees , but is often shared with management .
Geek Squad employees have allegedly engaged in peeping tom activities on female customers during in - house service visits .

The employee then allegedly shared the photos on the internet .
In 2002 , during a spate of legal threats and challenges to competitors with " geek " in their names , Geek Squad attempted to block the trademark registration of New England area competitor Geek Housecalls claiming that it violated their trademarks .
When Geek Housecalls refused to budge , Geek Squad filed civil suit .
After two years of wrangling , Geek Squad and Geek Housecalls arrived at an out - of - court settlement , the details of which can not be disclosed according to the terms of the settlement except to state that Geek Housecalls retained its name .
In 2006 , Geek Squad was sued for allegedly using unauthorized copies of Winternals ' Emergency Repair Disk Commander .

Best Buy and Geek Squad were accused of copyright infringement , circumvention of copyright infringement systems , and misappropriation of trade secrets .
A settlement was eventually reached , and Winternals created a three - year agreement in place with Best Buy , allowing Geek Squad employees to lawfully use their licensed programs , including the ERD Commander .
In 2010 , Best Buy issued a trademark infringement cease and desist letter against a priest in Wisconsin for painting " God Squad " on his car .
