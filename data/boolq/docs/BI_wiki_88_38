DEATH FROM LAUGHTER Death from laughter is a rare form of death , usually resulting from cardiac arrest or asphyxiation , caused by a fit of laughter .
Instances of death by laughter have been recorded from the times of ancient Greece to the modern day .
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Section::::Pathophysiology .
Death may result from several pathologies that deviate from benign laughter .
Infarction of the pons and medulla oblongata in the brain may cause pathological laughter .
Laughter can cause atonia and collapse ( " gelastic syncope " ) , which in turn can cause trauma .
See also laughter - induced syncope , cataplexy , and Bezold - Jarisch reflex .
Gelastic seizures can be due to focal lesions to the hypothalamus .
Depending upon the size of the lesion , the emotional lability may be a sign of an acute condition , and not itself the cause of the fatality .
Gelastic syncope has also been associated with the cerebellum .
