Kooper , born in Brooklyn , grew up in a Jewish family in Hollis Hills , Queens , New York .
His first professional work was as a 14-year - old guitarist in the Royal Teens , best known for their 1958 ABC Records novelty 12-bar blues riff , " Short Shorts " ( although Kooper did not play on the recording ) .
In 1960 , he teamed up with songwriters Bob Brass and Irwin Levine to write and record demos for Sea - Lark Music Publishing .
The trio 's biggest hits were " This Diamond Ring " , recorded by Gary Lewis and the Playboys , and " I Must Be Seeing Things " , recorded by Gene Pitney ( both 1965 ) .
When he was 21 , Kooper moved to Greenwich Village .
He performed with Bob Dylan in concert in 1965 , including playing Hammond organ with Dylan at the Newport Folk Festival , and in the recording studio in 1965 and 1966 .
Kooper also played the Hammond organ riffs on Dylan 's " Like a Rolling Stone " .
It was in those recording sessions that Kooper met and befriended Mike Bloomfield , whose guitar playing he admired .
He worked extensively with Bloomfield for several years .
Kooper played organ once again with Dylan during his 1981 world tour .
Kooper joined the Blues Project as their keyboardist in 1965 ; he left the band shortly before their gig at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 , although he did play a solo set at the famous festival , as evidenced by bootlegs of the event .
He formed Blood , Sweat & Tears in 1967 , leaving due to creative differences in 1968 , after the release of the group 's first album , Child Is Father to the Man .
He recorded Super Session with Bloomfield and Stills in 1968 , and in 1969 he collaborated with 15-year - old guitarist Shuggie Otis on the album Kooper Session .
In 1975 he produced the debut album by the Tubes .
Kooper has played on hundreds of records , including ones by the Rolling Stones , B. B. King , the Who , the Jimi Hendrix Experience , Alice Cooper , and Cream .
On occasion , he has even overdubbed his own efforts , as on The Live Adventures of Mike Bloomfield and Al Kooper and other albums , under the pseudonym " Roosevelt Gook " .
After moving to Atlanta in 1972 , he discovered the band Lynyrd Skynyrd , and produced and performed on their first three albums , including the singles " Sweet Home Alabama " and " Free Bird " .
In 1972 he rejoined the Blues Project at a charity concert promoted by Bruce Blakeman at Valley Stream Central High School .
He wrote the score for the TV series Crime Story and for the film The Landlord and wrote music for several made - for - television movies .
He was the musical force behind many of the pop tunes , including " You 're the Lovin' End " , for The Banana Splits , a children 's television program .
LIFE AND CAREER ( 1980S – PRESENT ) Section::::Life and career ( 1980s –
present ) .
During the late 1980s Kooper had his own dedicated keyboard studio room in the historic Sound Emporium recording studio in Nashville , next to
studio B. Kooper published a memoir , Backstage Passes : Rock ' n ' Roll Life in the Sixties ( 1977 ) , which was revised and published as Backstage Passes and Backstabbing Bastards : Memoirs of a Rock ' n ' Roll Survivor ( 1998 ) .
The revised edition includes indictments of " manipulators " in the music industry , including his one - time business manager , Stan Polley .
An updated edition , including supplementary material , was published by Backbeat Books in 2008 .
Kooper 's status as a published author enabled him to join ( and act as musical director of ) the Rock Bottom Remainders , a band made up of writers , including Dave Barry , Stephen King , Amy Tan , and Matt Groening .
In May 2001 , Kooper was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music .
Kooper is retired from teaching songwriting and recording production at Berklee College of Music , in Boston , and plays weekend concerts with his bands the ReKooperators and the Funky Faculty .
In 2008 , he participated in the production of the album Psalngs , the debut release of Canadian musician John Lefebvre .
Kooper was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum , in Nashville , in 2008 .
In 2005 , Martin Scorsese produced a documentary titled for the PBS American Masters Series in which Kooper 's contributions are recognized .
LIKE A ROLLING STONE Section::::Like a Rolling Stone .
Al Kooper is most notable as the driving force behind the RIAA certified gold album , Super Session ( with Stephen Stills and Mike Bloomfield ) ( 1968 ) as well as Blood , Sweat & Tears ( 1968 ) .
He played the organ parts of Bob Dylan 's " Like a Rolling Stone " and was in the band along with Bloomfield and Barry Goldberg at Dylan 's notorious ' electric folk ' gig at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965 .
Kooper had been invited to the session as an observer and hoped to be allowed to sit in on guitar , his primary instrument .
He uncased his guitar and began tuning it .
After hearing Mike Bloomfield , who was the hired session guitarist , warming up , he concluded that Bloomfield was a much better guitarist , so Kooper put his guitar aside and retreated into the control room .
As the recording sessions progressed , keyboardist Paul Griffin was moved from the Hammond organ to piano .
Kooper quickly suggested to producer Tom Wilson that he had a " great organ part " for the song ( which he later confessed was just a ruse to play in the session ) , and Wilson responded , " Al , you 're not an organ player , you 're a guitar player " , but Kooper stood his ground .
Before Wilson could explicitly reject Kooper 's suggestion , he was interrupted by a phone call in the control room .
Kooper immediately went into the studio and sat down at the organ .
When Wilson returned , he was shocked to find Kooper in the studio .
By this time , Kooper had been playing along with Dylan and his backing band .
His organ can be heard coming in an eighth note behind the other members of the band , as Kooper followed to make sure he was playing the proper chords .
During a playback of tracks in the control room , when asked about the organ track , Dylan was emphatic :
" Turn the organ up ! "
