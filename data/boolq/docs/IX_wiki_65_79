George Turner is a popular columnist for a top selling Sydney newspaper , writing a weekly column which he insists must be exactly 800 words .
After his wife dies , he buys ( over the internet and unseen ) a new home in a ( fictional ) small New Zealand seaside town called Weld , where his parents took him on holiday as a child .
He then has to break the news to his two teenage children , Shay and Arlo .
