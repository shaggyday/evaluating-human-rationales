Section::::Setting and characters .
Call of Duty :
Black Ops III takes place in 2065 , 40 years after the events of Black Ops II , in a world facing upheaval from conflicts , climate change and new technologies .
A Third Cold War is ongoing between two global alliances , known as Winslow Accord and Common Defense Pact .
In response to the drone assaults caused by narco - terrorist Raul Menendez in 2025 , several countries around the world have developed Directed Energy Air Defense systems that render conventional air forces virtually useless .
As such , most of the warfare between countries is done by covert operatives fighting behind enemy lines .
Military technology has progressed to the point where robotics play a major role in combat , and both fully robotic humanoid drones and cyborg supersoldiers have been developed to fight in the battlefield .
There is speculation and fear about an eventual robotic takeover .
Like previous installments in the Black Ops series , the campaign follows a team of black ops soldiers , who work for Winslow Accord .
The player character ( voiced by Ben Browder if male and Abby Brammell if female ) and Jacob Hendricks ( Sean Douglas ) are members of the faction 's wetwork team , while Commander John Taylor ( Christopher Meloni ) and his team Sebastian Diaz ( Reynaldo Gallegos ) , Sarah Hall ( Katee Sackhoff ) , and Peter Maretti ( Ary Katz ) , compose the faction 's cybernetics division .
Rachel Kimsey voices CIA agent Rachel Kane , Robert Picardo voices
the Coalescence Corporation CEO Sebastian Krueger
, Tony Amendola voices the therapist Dr. Yousef Salim , and Lynn Chen voices the 54 Immortals criminal organization leader , Goh Xiulan .
NFL running back Marshawn Lynch makes a cameo appearance in the game as a 54 Immortals mercenary .
Included in the game is the " Nightmares " campaign mode , which is a retelling of the main campaign with the plot changed to incorporate zombies and other supernatural beings .
In this campaign , the lethal Virus 61 - 15 is released in various cities around the world , turning whoever it infects into zombies .
In response , the governments of the world seal off the worst infected areas into Quarantine Zones and form the Deadkillers , cybernetic soldiers trained to exterminate zombies .
STORY Section::::Story .
On October 27 , 2065 , the Winslow Accord black ops initiate a successful mission in Ethiopia to rescue hostages from the tyrannical Nile River Coalition .
However , the Player is critically wounded by a combat robot .
Rescued by Taylor , the Player undergoes cybernetic surgery to save their life , being installed with a direct neural interface ( DNI ) and receiving virtual training from Taylor and his team during surgery .
Hendricks also undergoes surgery .
After five years of wetwork , the Player and Hendricks are put under the command of Rachel Kane and tasked with investigating a CIA black site in Singapore that has gone quiet .
They find the site attacked by the 54 Immortals and the site 's data stolen .
Kane concludes that Taylor and his team defected and murdered the staff .
The Player and Hendricks then disguise themselves as arms dealers and meet up with the 54 Immortals .
The mission goes awry when their cover is blown , causing the death of one of the 54i 's leaders , Goh Min .
They manage to recover data regarding Taylor 's last known location , a facility of the Coalescence Corporation in Singapore ( destroyed ten years prior in a mysterious explosion that killed 300,000 people ) .
The Player and Hendricks travel to the facility , and discover a hidden CIA research laboratory .
The pair find Diaz leaking CIA information and are forced to kill him .
Interfacing with Diaz 's DNI , Hendricks discovers Taylor is trying to find the survivors of the explosion : Sebastian Krueger and Dr. Yousef Salim .
The leaked information allows the Immortals to capture Kane .
The Player disobeys Kane 's orders to leave and rescues her by killing Immortals ' other leader , Goh Min 's sister Xiulan .
The trio then head to Egypt and find Salim , who reveals that he performed secret DNI experiments involving comforting humans via a calming exercise involving imagining a frozen forest .
Salim is then interrogated and executed by Taylor .
The Player , Hendricks and Kane pursue Taylor with assistance from the Egyptian Army .
After killing Hall , the Player connects to her DNI and encounters Corvus , a gestalt intelligence created during the experiments to monitor thoughts of DNI users which malfunctioned , causing the explosion .
Infecting Taylor and his team , Corvus made them obsessed with finding the forest , with the Player and Hendricks also becoming infected after interfacing with Hall and Diaz .
After killing Maretti , the pair track down Taylor in Cairo .
After wounding the Player , Taylor manages to resist Corvus and tear his DNI out , sparing the Player .
However , Hendricks then succumbs to Corvus and kills Taylor before abandoning the Player , leaving for Z√ºrich to find Krueger .
The Player races to Z√ºrich with Kane to stop him .
Reaching Z√ºrich 's Coalescence Corporation , the pair find Corvus caused the explosion with the gas Nova 6 .
Kane attempts to contain it , but Corvus locks her in the compound room , leaking the gas to kill her in front of a helpless Player .
Continuing on , the Player finds Hendricks holding Krueger hostage .
After Hendricks kills Krueger , the Player kills him in turn .
The Player then tries to kill themselves to end Corvus ' infection , but ends up in a simulated frozen forest , created by Corvus to retain the consciousness of dead DNI users .
Taylor , still alive after becoming a glitch in the forest , reunites with the Player , stating that they must purge their DNI to end Corvus .
With Taylor 's help , the Player resists Corvus ' last - ditch manipulation and purges their DNI , erasing the virus .
Stumbling out of the Zurich headquarters , the Player identifies themselves to Z√ºrich Security Forces as " Taylor " .
Taylor 's mission reports reveal that the Player actually died during their cybernetics surgery due to complications .
The resulting events until Taylor 's death occur in a simulation deviating from Taylor and Hendricks 's experience of hunting down Dylan Stone and his team ( Javier Ramirez , Alice Conrad , and Joseph Fierro ) , their teammates who defected after finding the CIA black site .
The Player 's consciousness is shown living in Taylor 's mind throughout the simulation , indicating that the Player manages to take over Taylor 's body after his simulated death until the DNI purge sees Corvus erased and Taylor regains control .
NIGHTMARES Section::::Nightmares .
The Player wakes up only to be told by Dr. Salim that they are dead , and that the Player must recount their memories .
The Player tells Dr. Salim that they are a Deadkiller who was sent to investigate the disappearance of Taylor 's Deadkiller team .
However , upon investigating , the Player and Hendricks discover that Taylor 's team has used their DNI connections to disable the Quarantine Zone defenses all over the world .
Teaming up with Rachel Kane , the Player and Hendricks chase Taylor 's team all from Singapore to Egypt , eventually being forced to kill the entire team .
However , Hendricks is infected by the same virus that turned Taylor and his team mad , and heads for Zurich .
The Player discovers that Dr. Salim is in fact Deimos , the demigod responsible for unleashing the undead plague on humanity .
Deimos had entered the Player 's mind when they interfaced with Hall , and attempts to manipulate them into opening a portal to his home dimension , Malus .
The Player is then contacted by another demigod , Dolos , who is sympathetic to humanity and seeks to kill Deimos , her brother .
Dolos transports both the Player and Deimos to Malus , where Deimos is vulnerable .
Under Dolos ' guidance , the Player kills Deimos , ending the undead plague on Earth , but trapping the Player in Malus .
Dolos then explains to the Player that her true plans are to kill every other demigod and supernatural being that can challenge her , and the Player agrees to help her .
MULTIPLAYER Section::::Multiplayer .
The Multiplayer mode of Black Ops III features a shared narrative setting with the campaign , in which players battle in virtual simulations across a variety of battlefields , while wielding the avatars of nine elite soldiers , referred to collectively as " Specialists " : infantry grunt Donnie " Ruin " Walsh ; scoutswoman Alessandra " Outrider " Castillo ; engineer David " Prophet " Wilkes ; demolitions expert Erin " Battery " Baker ; 54 Immortals enforcer He " Seraph " Zhen - Zhen ; survivalist Tavo " Nomad " Rojas ; specialized combat robot " Reaper " ; assassin " Spectre " ; and arsonist
Krystof " Firebreak " Hejek .
Through progression of each Specialist , players can unlock audio logs that provide backstories of each of the soldier .
Full progression of all Specialists unlocks a final audio log , in which an unknown informant reports to his superior about keeping tabs on " eight other soldiers " , implying that one of the Specialists , heavily hinted to be Prophet , is not a simulated avatar , but the real person injecting themselves into the simulation to monitor the other eight .

Section::::Zombies .
Section::::Settings and characters .
Like in previous games , the Zombies storyline in Call of Duty :
Black Ops III is told in an episodic format , with one map , " Shadows of Evil " , available at launch , and the rest to follow in the downloadable content season . "
Shadows of Evil " focuses on a new group of characters : Nero Blackstone ( Jeff Goldblum ) , Jessica Rose ( Heather Graham ) , Jack Vincent ( Neal McDonough ) and Floyd Campbell ( Ron Perlman ) , who reside in the fictional Morg City .
Treyarch describes the new characters as " troubled individuals " with " a long and sordid history of past misdeeds " .
The four characters are thrown into a twisted version of the city , overrun by zombies , and are guided by a mysterious , unreliable figure called the Shadowman ( Robert Picardo ) .
" Shadows of Evil " acts as a prologue that leads into the core storyline , focusing on the Dimension 63 version of the original characters :
" Tank " Dempsey ( Steven Blum ) ,
Nikolai Belinski ( Fred Tatasciore ) , Takeo Masaki ( Tom Kane ) and Edward Richtofen ( Nolan North ) , who were introduced in the Black Ops II map " Origins " , referred to collectively as Primis .

STORY Section::::Story .
Following , Doctor Ludvig Maxis , whose brain resided in a mechanical drone at the time , arrives at Agartha and is given a new body by Doctor Monty , a self - proclaimed omnipotent being and member of the Order of the Keepers .
After helping to cleanse the soul of his daughter Samantha from the original timeline , Monty instructs Maxis to retrieve an artifact called the Summoning Key , a powerful artifact that can fix their world back to its original state .
To do so , Maxis instructs his friend Doctor Edward Richtofen to retrieve the Kronorium , an ancient book detailing the events of every universe and dimension , which contains the location of the Key .
After learning of the Key 's location , Richtofen travels to Dimension 63 and arrives in Morg City in 1944 , where the Apothicons , former Keepers who were corrupted and mutated by the dark energy of the Aether , manipulated four individuals :
Jessica Rose , a burlesque dancer ; Jack Vincent , a corrupt cop ; Floyd Campbell , an up - and - coming boxer ; and Nero Blackstone , a washed - up magician .
Misled into doing the bidding of an Apothicon named the Shadowman , the four opened a rift beneath the city using the Summoning Key , thereby freeing an ancient Apothicon beast .
With the Keepers ' aid , the four manage to trap the Shadowman inside the Key , and banish the beast from their dimension .
Before they could retrieve the Summoning Key from the Keepers , however , Richtofen snags the Key from them , thanks them for their effort and exits through a portal , leaving the four and the rest of Dimension 63 to be doomed by the Apothicons .
Richtofen travels to Dimension 2210 and collects the soul of his alternate self , then releases the soul to Agartha , where Monty gives the soul a child 's body , and calls him Eddie .
The Dimension 63 versions of " Tank " Dempsey , Nikolai Belinski , and Takeo Masaki pursue Richtofen in his interdimensional journey , and arrive in the Der Riese facility in the original timeline , only moments after Maxis and Samantha were teleported away by the original Richtofen .
The three attempt to convince him to awaken their original selves , but are interrupted by the Dimension 63 Richtofen , who appears out of the teleporter and kills his counterpart , triggering various timeline fractures .
The four then band together to fend off the zombie horde once more ; eventually , they activates a beacon within the facility , allowing Maxis to locate them from Agartha .
In pursuit of the original Dempsey , the four then travel to Der Eisendrache ,
Group 935 's fortress in Austria .
Despite Group 935 member Doctor Groph 's attempt at preventing the group from retrieving the test subject , he ultimately fails and perishes when Richtofen overrides the castle 's defense system and sends a barrage of missiles towards the moon .
As the four retrieve the original Dempsey , Richtofen reveals his plan to prevent their original incarnations from wreaking havoc upon the universe .
Dimension 63 Dempsey then volunteers to kill his own counterpart before allowing Richtofen to absorb his soul with the Key .
Afterwards , the group attempts to teleport to a new fractured timeline to locate the original Takeo , who is held prisoner at a Pacific island by the Japanese research group Division 9 .
They discover that Division 9 had been experimenting with plant life mutation using Element 115 , with the original Takeo also a victim of the experimentation .
After they manage to release him from the mutation , Dimension 63 Takeo is shocked to learn that the Emperor of Japan betrayed his original self and sent him to this island out of petty jealousy .
The original Takeo proceeds to commit seppuku , with his Dimension 63 self decapitating him .
After absorbing the original Takeo 's soul with the Key , Richtofen takes the crew to Alcatraz in Dimension 63 , where they retrieve several blood vials , the purpose of which he refuses to explain at the time .
The crew then teleports to another fractured timeline and lands in a war - torn Stalingrad in 1945 , where the Soviet Union has stolen Group 935 's technology to create their own giant robots and mechanical soldiers , while Germany is aided by ancient dragons resurrected and bred by Division 9 .
As the crew traverses across the city , they are forced to help Sophia , Maxis ' former assistant who has been transformed into a machine , to initiate the Ascension Protocol , allowing her to gain knowledge of interdimensional travel .
Monty also introduces himself to the crew , as he informs them of the state of the multiverse .
Amidst the chaos , the original Nikolai , who has taken control of a modified drone unit , teams up with the group to destroy the alpha dragon .
However , upon the dragon 's death , Nikolai refuses to surrender , forcing the four to take out his drone .
The original Nikolai is angered by his Dimension 63 self as he mentions their deceased wife , and attempts to shoot him , only to be killed in retaliation .
With all souls collected , Richtofen calls out to Maxis to summon a portal , and release the souls into it .
The group returns to Agartha and arrives in " The House " , a place built by Monty to prevent all forces of evil from infecting it , ensuring the safety of the children ( Samantha and cleansed versions of the original souls in child form ) .
After sealing off the House from the rest of the multiverse , Maxis is manipulated by the voice of the Shadowman into releasing him upon contact with the Summoning Key .
The Shadowman then uses his power to merge various other dimensions , including the Dark Aether , allowing the Apothicons to enter and wreak havoc .
Richtofen and the crew manage to help Sophia enter the dimension , and with her assistance , retrieve the Summoning Key and the Kronorium .
They then confront the Shadowman together , and defeat him once and for all using the combined power of the two artifacts .
Maxis , who still resides within the Key , then absorbs the souls of the children into the Key , and joins Sophia as they fly toward the Apothicon sun , banishing all Apothicon presences from Agartha .
Richtofen and the crew are able to remain in the dimension without fading from existence , thanks to the blood vials they retrieved earlier .
Monty , worried about the four becoming a paradox in his perfect world , contemplates between erasing their existence and sending them to a distant corner of the universe .
In a moment , the four begin to fade away , then reappear in ancient medieval times , where they would be remembered as " Primis " , heroes who aided the Keepers in sealing away the Apothicons in the Great War , effectively " completing the cycle " of the universe .

RECEPTION CRITICAL RESPONSE Section::::Reception .
Section::::Critical response .
According to review aggregator Metacritic , Call of Duty : Black Ops III received " generally favorable " critic reviews for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One , and " mixed or average " critic reviews for PC .
GameSpot awarded it a score of 7 out of 10 , saying , " Black Ops III does n't offer anything remarkable to the series , but does just enough to maintain the Call of Duty status quo .
The franchise , however slowly , continues its inexorable march . "
Polygon also gave the game a score of 7 out of 10 , saying " Black Ops IIIs biggest point of recommendation may be the breadth of content there , and that 's a valid point of view .
But Treyarch does n't meaningfully move the series forward here .
" IGN awarded it a score of 9.2 out of 10 , saying " With fun 4-player co - op , new powers , and a fleshed out Zombies mode , Black Ops 3 is the biggest Call of Duty game yet . " Despite earning positive reviews , there were some criticism .
The campaign was heavily criticized for its story and the absence of fan favourite story mode characters .
Stuart Andrews of Trusted Reviews stated in his review : " The only problem is that , as with all all - you - can - eat buffets , some portions are a lot tastier than others , leaving you wondering whether a little more focus might have created something really exceptional .
Black Ops 3 is a solid installment that will please the series ' hardcore fans , but it 's not a mainstream crowd - pleaser in the way that last year 's Advanced Warfare was .
In a way , it suffers because of Call of Duty : Advanced Warfare .
The first Black Ops bought a very distinctive flavour to Call of Duty ; one born of conspiracy theory , spy thrillers and darker style of storytelling .
The second mixed that up with a sci - fi techno - thriller , splitting the action between interleaved , branching past and near - future storylines and bringing bots and drones into the mix .
Black Ops 3s focuses entirely on the sci - fi stuff , loses most of its conspiracy theory trappings and brings augmented super - soldiers in .
The result sometimes feels less like a third Black Ops game than Call of Duty : Even More Advanced Warfare .
It leaves you wondering whether it 's time Call of Duty looked back to the past for inspiration . "
