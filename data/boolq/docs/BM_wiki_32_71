CULTURE OF INDONESIA
The culture of Indonesia has been shaped by long interaction between original indigenous customs and multiple foreign influences .
Indonesia is centrally - located along ancient trading routes between the Far East , South Asia and the Middle East , resulting in many cultural practices being strongly influenced by a multitude of religions , including Hinduism , Buddhism , Confucianism , Islam and Christianity , all strong in the major trading cities .
The result is a complex cultural mixture very different from the original indigenous cultures .
Examples of the fusion of Islam with Hindu include Javanese Abangan belief , the fusion of Hinduism , Buddhism and animism in Bodha , and the fusion of Hinduism and animism in Kaharingan ; others could be cited .
Balinese dances have stories about ancient Buddhist and Hindu kingdoms , while Islamic art forms and architecture are present in Sumatra , especially in the Minangkabau and Aceh regions .
Traditional art , music and sport are combined in a martial art form called Pencak Silat .
The Western world has influenced Indonesia in science , technology and modern entertainment such as television shows , film and music , as well as political system and issues .
India has notably influenced Indonesian songs and movies .
A popular type of song is the Indian - rhythmical dangdut , which is often mixed with Arab and Malay folk music .
Despite the influences of foreign culture , some remote Indonesian regions still preserve uniquely indigenous culture .
Indigenous ethnic groups Mentawai , Asmat , Dani , Dayak , Toraja and many others are still practising their ethnic rituals , customs and wearing traditional clothes .

The soft Sasando music from the province of East Nusa Tenggara in West Timor is completely different .
Sasando uses an instrument made from a split leaf of the Lontar palm ( Borassus flabellifer ) , which bears some resemblance to a harp .
DANCE Section::::Dance .
Indonesian dance reflects the diversity of culture from ethnic groups that composed the nation of Indonesia .
Austronesian roots and Melanesian tribal dance forms are visible , and influences ranging from neighbouring Asian countries ; such as India , China , and Middle East to European western styles through colonisation .
Each ethnic group has their own distinct dances ; makes total dances in Indonesia are more than 3000 Indonesian original dances .
However , the dances of Indonesia can be divided into three eras ; the Prehistoric Era , the Hindu / Buddhist Era and the Era of Islam , and into two genres ; court dance and folk dance .
There is a continuum in the traditional dances depicting episodes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata from India , ranging through Thailand , all the way to Bali .
There is a marked difference , though , between the highly stylised dances of the courts of Yogyakarta and Surakarta and their popular variations .
While the court dances are promoted and even performed internationally , the popular forms of dance art and drama must largely be discovered locally .
During the last few years , Saman from Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam has become rather popular and is often portrayed on TV .
Reog Ponorogo is also a dance that originated from the district Ponorogo , East Java , which is a visualisation of the legendary story Wengker kingdom and the kingdom of Kediri .
A popular line dance called Poco - poco was originated in Indonesia and also popular in Malaysia , but at early April 2011 Malaysian Islamic clerics banned the poco - poco dance for Muslims due to them believing it is traditionally a Christian dance and that its steps make the sign of the cross .
DRAMA AND THEATRE Section::::Drama and theatre .
Wayang , the Javanese , Sundanese , and Balinese shadow puppet theatre shows display several mythological legends such as Ramayana and Mahabharata , and many more .
Wayang Orang is Javanese traditional dance drama based on wayang stories .
Various Balinese dance drama also can be included within traditional form of Indonesian drama .

Modern performing art also developed in Indonesia with their distinct style of drama .
Notable theatre , dance , and drama troupe such as Teater Koma are gain popularity in Indonesia as their drama often portray social and political satire of Indonesian society .
MARTIAL ARTS Section::::Martial arts .
The art of Pencak Silat was created and firstly developed in the islands of Java and Sumatra .
It is an art for survival and practised throughout Indonesian archipelago .
Centuries of tribal wars in Indonesian history had shaped silat as it was used by the ancient warriors of Indonesia .
Silat was used to determine the rank and position of warriors in old Indonesian kingdoms .
Contacts with Indians and Chinese has further enriched silat .
Silat reached areas beyond Indonesia mainly through diaspora of Indonesian people .
People from various regions like Aceh , Minangkabau , Riau , Bugis , Makassar , Java , Banjar , etc .
moved into and settled in Malay Peninsula and other islands .
They brought silat and passed it down to their descendants .
The Indonesian of half - Dutch descent are also credited as the first to have brought the art into Europe .
Silat was used by Indonesian independence fighters during their struggle against the Dutch colonial rule .
Unfortunately after Indonesia achieving their independence , silat became less popular among Indonesian youth compare to foreign martial arts like Karate and Taekwondo .
This probably because silat was not taught openly and only passed down among blood relatives , the other reason is the lack of media portrayal of the art .
Efforts have been made to introduce and reintroduce the beauty of silat to Indonesian youth and the world .
Exhibitions and promotions by individuals as well as state - sponsored groups helped the growing of silat 's popularity , particularly in Europe and United States .
Indonesian 2009 Silat movie Merantau is one of Indonesian efforts to introduce silat to international scene .
Another martial art from Indonesia is Tarung Derajat .
It is a modern combat system created by Haji Ahmad Drajat based on his experience as a street fighter .
Tarung Drajat has been acknowledge as a national sport by KONI in 1998 and is now used by Indonesian Army as part of their basic training .
TRADITIONAL VISUAL ARTS PAINTING
Section::::Traditional visual arts .
Section::::Painting .
What Indonesian painting before the 19th century are mostly restricted to the decorative arts , considered to be a religious and spiritual activity , comparable to the pre-1400 European art .
Artists ' names are anonymous , since the individual human creator was seen as far less important than their creation to honour the deities or spirits .
Some examples are the Kenyah decorative art , based on endemic natural motifs such as ferns and hornbills , found decorating the walls of Kenyah long houses .
Other notable traditional art is the geometric Toraja wood carvings .
Balinese painting are initially the narrative images to depict scenes of Balinese legends and religious scripts .
The classical Balinese paintings are often decorating the lontar manuscripts and also the ceilings of temples pavilion .
Under the influence of the Dutch colonial power , a trend toward Western - style painting emerged in the 19th century .
In the Netherlands , the term " Indonesian Painting " is applied to the paintings produced by Dutch or other foreign artists who lived and worked in the former Netherlands - Indies .
The most famous indigenous 19th century
Indonesian painter is Raden Saleh ( 1807â€“1877 ) , the first indigenous artist to study in Europe .
His art is heavily influenced by Romanticism .
In the 1920s Walter Spies settled in Bali , he is often credited with attracting the attention of Western cultural figures to Balinese culture and art .
His works has somehow influenced Balinese artists and painters .
Today Bali has one of the most vivid and richest painting traditions in Indonesia .
The 1920s to 1940s were a time of growing nationalism in Indonesia .
The previous period of romanticism movement was not seen as a purely Indonesian movement and did not develop .
Painters began to see the natural world for inspiration .
Some examples of Indonesian painter during this period are the Balinese Ida Bagus Made and the realist Basuki Abdullah .
The Indonesian Painters Association ( Persatuan Ahli - Ahli Gambar Indonesia or PERSAGI , 1938â€“1942 ) was formed during this period .
PERSAGI established a contemporary art philosophy that saw art works as reflections of the artist 's individual or personal view as well as an expression of national cultural thoughts .
From the 1940s on , artists started to mix Western techniques with Southeast Asian imagery and content .
Painters that rooted in the revolutionary movement of the World War and the post - World War period started to appear during this period , such as Sudjojono , Affandi , and Hendra .
During the 1960s , new elements were added when abstract expressionism and Islamic art began to be absorbed by the art community .
Also during this period , group of painters that are more concerned about the reality of Indonesian society began to appear , taking inspiration from the social problem such as division between the rich and the poor , pollution , and deforestation .
The national identity of Indonesia was stressed by these painters through the use of a realistic , documentary style .
During the Sukarno period this socially - engaged art was officially promoted , but after 1965 it lost popularity due to its presumed communist tendencies .
Three art academies offer extensive formal training in visual art :
Bandung Institute of Technology founded in 1947 ; the Akademi Seni Rupa Indonesia ( Indonesian Fine Arts Academy ) or ASRI , now known as ISI , in Yogyakarta was inaugurated in 1950 ; and the Institut Kesenian Jakarta ( Jakarta Arts Institute ) or IKJ , was opened in 1970 .

Oversized saddle roofs with large eaves , such as the homes of the Batak and the tongkonan of Toraja , are often bigger than the house they shelter .
The fronts of Torajan houses are frequently decorated with buffalo horns , stacked one above another , as an indication of status .
The outside walls also frequently feature decorative reliefs .
The 8th - century Borobudur temple near Yogyakarta is the largest Buddhist temple in the world , and is notable for incorporating about 2,672 relief panels and 504 Buddha statues into its structure , telling the story of the life of the Buddha .
As the visitor ascends through the eight levels of the temple , the story unfolds , the final three levels simply containing stupas and statues of the Buddha .
The building is said to incorporate a map of the Buddhist cosmos and is a masterful fusion of the didactic narrative relief , spiritual symbolism , monumental design and the serene meditative environs .
The whole monument itself resembles a giant stupa , but seen from above
it forms a mandala .
The nearby 9th - century temple complex at Prambanan contains some of the best preserved examples of Hindu temple architecture in Java .
The temple complex comprises eight main shrines , surrounded by 224 smaller shrines .

Also Satay ( Sate in Indonesian ) , which originated from Java , Madura , and Sumatra , has gained popularity as a street vendor food from Singapore to Thailand .
In the 15th century , both the Portuguese and Arab traders arrived in Indonesia with the intention of trading for pepper and other spices .
During the colonial era , immigrants from many countries arrived in Indonesia and brought different cultures as well as cuisines .
Most native Indonesians eat rice as the main dish , with a wide range of vegetables and meat as side dishes .
However , in some parts of the country , such as Irian Jaya and Ambon , the majority of the people eat sago ( a type of tapioca ) and sweet potato .
The most important aspect of modern Indonesian cuisine is that food must be halal , conforming to Islamic food laws .
Haraam , the opposite of halal , includes pork and alcohol .
However , in some regions where there is a significant non - Muslim population , non - halal foods are also commonly served .
Indonesian dishes are usually spicy , using a wide range of chili peppers and spices .
The most popular dishes include nasi goreng ( fried rice ) , Satay , Nasi Padang ( a dish of Minangkabau ) and soy - based dishes , such as tofu and tempe .
A unique characteristic of some Indonesian food is the application of spicy peanut sauce in their dishes , as a dressing for Gado - gado or Karedok ( Indonesian style salad ) , or for seasoning grilled chicken satay .
Another unique aspect of Indonesian cuisine is using terasi or belacan , a pungent shrimp paste in dishes of sambal oelek ( hot pungent chili sauce ) .
The sprinkling of fried shallots also gives a unique crisp texture to some Indonesian dishes .
Chinese and Indian cultures have influenced the serving of food and the types of spices used .
It is very common to find Chinese food in Indonesia such as Dim Sum and noodles , and Indian cuisine such as Tandoori chicken .
In addition , Western culture has significantly contributed to the extensive range of dishes .
However , the dishes have been transformed to suit Indonesian tastes .
For example , steaks are usually served with rice .

Some Indonesian foods have been adopted by the Dutch , like Indonesian rice table or ' rijsttafel ' .
