2018 FIFA WORLD CUP DISCIPLINARY RECORD
In the 2018 FIFA World Cup , which took place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018 , the main disciplinary actions taken against players came in the form of red and yellow cards .
A player sanctioned with a red card was sent off from the pitch and could not be replaced .
Furthermore , the player was automatically banned from his team 's next match .
After a straight red card , FIFA conducted a hearing and considered extending this ban beyond one match .
If the ban extended beyond the end of the World Cup finals ( for example , a player was sent off in his team 's last match ) , it had to be served in the team 's next competitive international match(es ) .
A player also received a one match ban if he picked up a single yellow card in two different games from the beginning of the group stage until the end of the quarter - finals , where single yellow cards were negated .
However , such a ban did not carry over beyond the World Cup finals if the second yellow card was collected in his team 's last match .
