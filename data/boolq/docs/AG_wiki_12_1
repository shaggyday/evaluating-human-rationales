TRANSATLANTIC COMMUNICATIONS CABLE
A transatlantic telecommunications cable is a submarine communications cable connecting one side of the Atlantic Ocean to the other .
In the 19th and early 20th centuries each cable was a single wire .
After mid - century , coaxial cable came into use , with amplifiers .
Late in the century , all used optical fiber , and most now use optical amplifiers .
HISTORY Section::::History .
When the first transatlantic telegraph cable was laid in 1858 by businessman Cyrus West Field , it operated for only three weeks ; subsequent attempts in 1865 and 1866 were more successful .
Although a telephone cable was discussed starting in the 1920s , to be practical it needed a number of technological advances which did not arrive until the 1940s .
Starting in 1927 , transatlantic telephone service was radio - based .
TAT-1 ( Transatlantic No . 1 ) was the first transatlantic telephone cable system .
It was laid between Gallanach Bay , near Oban , Scotland and Clarenville , Newfoundland between 1955 and 1956 by the cable ship Monarch .
It was inaugurated on September 25 , 1956 , initially carrying 36 telephone channels .
In the first 24 hours of public service there were 588 London – U.S. calls and 119 from London to Canada .
The capacity of the cable was soon increased to 48 channels .
Later , an additional three channels were added by use of C Carrier equipment .
Time - assignment speech interpolation ( TASI ) was implemented on the TAT-1 cable in June 1960 and effectively increased the cable 's capacity from 37 ( out of 51 available channels ) to 72 speech circuits .
TAT-1 was finally retired in 1978 .
Later coaxial cables , installed through the 1970s , used transistors and had higher bandwidth .
The Moscow – Washington hotline was initially connected through this system .
CURRENT TECHNOLOGY Section::::Current technology .
All cables presently in service use fiber optic technology .
Many cables terminate in Newfoundland and Ireland , which lie on the great circle route ( the shortest route ) from London , UK to New York City , USA .
There have been a succession of newer transatlantic cable systems .
All recent systems have used fiber optic transmission , and a self - healing ring topology .
Late in the 20th century , communications satellites lost most of their North Atlantic telephone traffic to these low cost , high capacity , low latency cables .
This advantage only increases over time as tighter cables provide higher speed – the 2012 generation of cables drop the transatlantic latency to under 60 milliseconds , according to Hibernia Atlantic , deploying such a cable that year .
Some new cables are being announced on the South Atlantic :
SACS ( South Atlantic Cable System ) and SAex(South Atlantic Express )
TAT CABLE ROUTES Section::::TAT cable routes .
The TAT series of cables constitute a large percentage of all North Atlantic cables .
All TAT cables are joint ventures between a number of telecommunications companies , e.g. British Telecom .
CANTAT cables terminate in Canada rather than in the USA . !
