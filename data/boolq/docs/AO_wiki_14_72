MUNCHKIN CAT The Munchkin or Sausage Cat is a new breed of cat characterized by its very short legs , which are caused by a genetic mutation .
Much controversy erupted over the breed when it was recognized by The International Cat Association in 1995 with critics voicing concern over potential health and mobility issues .
The name " munchkin " derives from writer L. Frank Baum 's diminutive inhabitants of Munchkin Country , originating in the 1900 novel , The Wonderful Wizard of Oz .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Short - legged cats have been documented a number of times around the world since the 1940s .
A British veterinary report in 1944 noted four generations of healthy short - legged cats which were similar to normal cats except for the length of the legs .
This line disappeared during the Second World War but other short - legged cats were spotted in Russia during 1956 and the United States in the 1970s .
In 1983 , Sandra Hochenedel , a music teacher in Louisiana , found two pregnant cats who had been chased under a truck by a bulldog .
She kept one of the cats and named her Blackberry and half of her kittens were born short - legged .
Hochenedel gave a short - legged male kitten from one of Blackberry 's litters to a friend , Kay LaFrance , and she named the kitten Toulouse .
It is from Blackberry and Toulouse that today 's Munchkin breed is descended .
Toulouse was an unneutered cat with outdoor access and after some time a population of stray short - legged cats started to form .
Thinking that they might have a new breed , Hochenedel and LaFrance contacted Dr. Solveig Pflueger , a show judge , chairperson of The International Cat Association 's ( TICA ) genetics committee and advisor to the Board of Directors .
Together with Dr. David Biller , Head of Radiology at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Kansas State University , Pflueger conducted studies on the cats and determined that the short - legged trait has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance and that the cats did not appear to have any spinal problems associated with those found in short - legged dog breeds such as the Corgi and Dachshund .
The Munchkin cat was first introduced to the general public in 1991 via a national network televised cat show held by The International Cat Association ( TICA ) in Madison Square Garden .
Critics predicted that the breed would develop back , hip and leg problems similar to those that plague some Dachshunds .
Amidst much controversy , the Munchkin was proposed as a new breed by foundation breeders Laurie Bobskill and Robert Bobskill of Massachusetts and accepted by TICA into its New Breed development program in September 1994 .
One veteran show judge resigned in protest , calling the breed an affront to breeders with ethics .
The Munchkin achieved TICA Championship status in May 2003 .
Apart from TICA , registries that recognize the breed includes The American Association of Cat Enthusiasts ( AACE ) , The United Feline Organization ( UFO ) , the Southern Africa Cat Council , and the Waratah National Cat Alliance in Australia .
There is controversy among breeders of pedigree cats as to what genetic mutations are abnormal and potentially disadvantageous to the cat .
Several cat registries do not recognize the Munchkin : Fédération Internationale Féline , which refuses to recognize what they consider a breed based on a " genetic disease " , achondroplasia .
The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy likewise refuses to recognize the breed , considering this breed and others like it to be " unacceptable " because they are based on an " abnormal structure or development " .
The breed is also not recognized by the Cat Fanciers ' Association .
The Australian Capital Territory ( a territory of Australia )
government consider the munchkin breed to be " malformed animals " and the deliberate breeding of them " unacceptable " because of the " genetic health problems associated with such breeding " .
Owners and Breeders of munchkins declare them to be " a sound breed " that is " ideal " for small homes and not particularly susceptible to health problems .
In 2014 , Lilieput , a Munchkin cat from Napa , California , was named the shortest statured living cat in the world by Guinness World Records .
She stands 5.25 inches ( 13.34 centimeters ) tall .
CHARACTERISTICS Section::::Characteristics .
The Munchkin is generally described as a sweet - natured , playful , people - oriented , outgoing and intelligent cat which responds well to being handled .
Some sources state that the shortness of their legs does not interfere with their running and leaping abilities , while others state their ability to jump is limited by their condition .
The Munchkin has similar characteristics to normal domestic cats , due to their frequent use as outcrosses .
It is a small to medium - sized cat with a moderate body type and medium - plush coat .
Male Munchkins typically weigh between 6 and 9 pounds ( 3–4 kg ) and are usually larger than female Munchkins , which typically weigh between 4 and 8 pounds .
The hind legs can be slightly longer than the front which creates a slight rise from the shoulder to the rump .
The legs of the Munchkin may be slightly bowed , although excessive bowing is a disqualification in the show ring .
Cow - hocked legs are also penalized .
The Munchkin comes in all coat colors and patterns .
It also comes in a long - haired variety , which is shown in a separate Munchkin Longhair category .
The short - haired variety has a medium - plush coat while the long - haired has a semi - long silky coat .
TICA rules for outcrossing allows the use of any domestic cat that does not already belong to a recognized breed .
Similarity to other breeds is grounds for disqualification .
Non - standard Munchkins are not allowed to be shown .
HEALTH Section::::Health .
Although the genetic mutation causing the short - legged trait in Munchkins has been referred to as achondroplasia , achondroplasia is typically associated with an enlarged head as well as short legs .
This combination of features is not seen in Munchkin cats .
The condition has sometimes been referred to as hypochondroplasia or pseudoachondroplasia .
Small litter sizes when two munchkin cats are crossed indicate that embryos that are homozygous for the munchkin gene are non - viable .
While there were early speculations that the Munchkin will develop spinal problems commonly seen in short - legged dog breeds , in 1995 several breeders had their oldest Munchkins X - rayed and examined for signs of joint or bone problems and found none .
However , there appear to be two conditions with increased incidence in the breed : lordosis ( excessive curvature of the spine ) and pectus excavatum ( hollowed chest ) .
Both conditions are commonly seen in humans with pseudoachondroplasia .
GENETICS Section::::Genetics .
The munchkin gene is autosomal dominant .
Homozygous embryos for the munchkin gene are not viable due to gene lethality , and do not develop in the womb .
Only kittens that are heterozygous for the munchkin gene develop into viable short legged munchkin kittens .
Because only heterozygous munchkin cats are able to pass on the gene , all litters with at least one munchkin parent have the possibility of containing kittens with the phenotypes : short - legged or normal - legged ( referred to as non - standard munchkin ) , with the genotypes of Mm or mm , where M is the trait for short legs and m is the trait for long legs .
The mating of two munchkin parents , Mm x Mm , have the chance of producing these offspring : 25 % MM- a nonviable kitten , 50 % Mm - short - legged , 25 % mm- normal .
The resulting litter will be 2/3 Mm - short - legged and 1/3 mm - normal .

DERIVED BREEDS Section::::Recognized derived breeds .
The Munchkin has been crossed with the curly - coated LaPerm to create the Skookum , the hairless Sphynx to create the Minskin and Bambino , another curly - coated Selkirk Rex to create the Lambkin , the Persian breed group(which includes Himalayans and Exotic Shorthair ) to create the Napoleon , the curled - eared American Curl to create the Kinkalow , the folded - eared Scottish Fold to create the Scottish Kilts , and also with the Bengal to create the Genetta .
