WAITER RULE
The Waiter Rule refers to a common belief that one 's true character can be gleaned from how one treats staff or service workers , such as a " waiter " .
The rule was one of William H Swanson 's 33 Unwritten Rules of Management , copied from Dave Barry 's version " If someone is nice to you but rude to the waiter , they are not a nice person . "
