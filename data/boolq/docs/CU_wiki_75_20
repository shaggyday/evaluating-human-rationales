COURTROOM WORKGROUP
In The United States criminal justice system , a Courtroom Workgroup is an informal arrangement between a criminal prosecutor , criminal defense attorney , and the judicial officer .
This foundational concept in the academic discipline of criminal justice recharacterizes the seemingly adversarial courtroom participants as collaborators in " doing justice .
" The courtroom workgroup was proposed by Eisenstein and Jacob in 1977 to explain their observations of the ways courts , especially lower level courts , actually come to decisions .
Because the courtroom workgroup deviates from the public consensus of how justice works , it has developed a deviant set of rules to continue its work and facilitate daily life for its participants .
The academic theory of the courtroom workgroup has four cornerstone concepts that recognize this fact : Speed , Pragmatic Cynicism , Collegiality , and Secrecy .
Efficient courtroom workgroups seek to process cases rather than dispense justice .
This has been confirmed to greater and lesser extents in different courts .
Defendants are assumed to be guilty .
The procedural merits of the case are the true determinative factors of an outcome .
Prosecutors and defense attorneys engage in a comparison of charges against possible procedural flaws and possible defenses to arrive at the going rate for a crime .
These factors are used to determine how much punishment the plea bargain will offer .
For example , group relationships and the desire to " maintain " a healthy working relationship are important to group members .
The workings of the courtroom group and the " going rate " for given crimes are not matters for public disclosure .
Estimates can be given to clients , but usually couched in terms of the prosecution 's willingness to negotiate .
( Summarized by O'Connor , T.R. , 2005 )
The courtroom workgroup is a mechanism for prosecutorial discretion .
Various techniques are used to convince the defendant that the evidence against him or her is overwhelming .
"
Charge stacking " is a process by which police and prosecutors create a case with numerous charges or numerous instances of the same charge to convince the defendant that the risk of not pleading guilty is intolerable .
The defendant may be convinced to plead guilty to a few of the charges in return for not being prosecuted for the remaining charges .
The courtroom workgroup is , in some sense , a response to a lack of resources for public defenders .
Defense attorneys in public defender offices often do not have sufficient time to prepare a case in detail for all of their clients .
Further , they often do not have the budget to fully investigate the facts of a case through either staff or private investigators .
They often must rely solely on police reports for such information .
In some jurisdictions , clients do not meet their attorneys until they are in court .
Typically , public defenders will meet briefly with clients in holding facilities or jails .
The defense attorney defends his or her client by seeking less punishment .
Huemann ( 1977 ) indicates that many defense attorneys feel pressured to keep up with their caseloads .
This pressure can manifest in the courtroom through rebukes by the judge for delays .
Many subtle pressures combine to encourage participation in the courtroom workgroup .
The concept of a courtroom workgroup is associated with plea bargaining .
The courtroom workgroup shows remarkable explanatory power in overburdened courts dealing with large caseloads .
The courtroom workgroup model is best suited to explain jurisdictions where defense attorneys are more or less permanently assigned , but even occasionally appointed lawyers can participate in these practices .
While many of the higher level prosecutions still follow the adversarial model , there is evidence that lower - level proceedings follow the courtroom workgroup model .
Boland , Brady , Tyson , & Bassler ( 1983 ) indicate that approximately 90 percent of criminal cases are settled by plea bargain .
This figure appears to be stable over the last twenty years ( Rainville & Reaves , 2003 ) .
Some collaborative efforts on the part of the courtroom workgroup simply must be present to facilitate this high percentage of pleas .
