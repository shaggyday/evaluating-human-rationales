CONSULAR IMMUNITY Consular immunity privileges are described in the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 1963 ( VCCR ) .
Consular immunity offers protections similar to diplomatic immunity , but these protections are not as extensive , given the functional differences between consular and diplomatic officers .
For example , consular officers are not accorded absolute immunity from a host country 's criminal jurisdiction , they may be tried for certain local crimes upon action by a local court , and are immune from local jurisdiction only in cases directly relating to consular functions .
