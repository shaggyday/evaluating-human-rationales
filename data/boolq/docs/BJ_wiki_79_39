POINT ( ICE HOCKEY )
In ice hockey , point has three contemporary meanings .
PERSONAL STAT
Section::::Personal Stat .
A point is awarded to a player for each goal scored or assist earned .
The total number of goals plus assists equals total points .
The Art Ross Trophy is awarded to the National Hockey League ( NHL ) player who leads the league in scoring points at the end of the regular season .
TEAM STAT
Section::::Team Stat .
Points are also awarded to assess standings ( or rankings ) .
For winning a game , a team always earns two points in the standings whether they win in regulation or overtime .
When a team ties , they earn one point .
Often , there are no ties ( in the NHL as a result of many rule changes after the 2004–05 NHL lockout ) .
However , a rule that was instituted in the 1999–2000 NHL season makes it so that when a team loses in overtime , they shall earn one point for making it to overtime .
This rule includes shootouts , which were instituted after the aforementioned lockout .
Teams that win in overtime or a shootout receive a bonus point together with the point they received for the initial draw .
POSITION
Section::::Position .
When a team is in the offensive zone , the area near the blue line and the boards is referred to as " the point " .
When a team is on the power play , its defencemen usually take up positions at the point .
The name is taken from the former names of the defence positions , point and cover point , as first developed in the 19th century , the earliest days of ice hockey 's development .
