OFF - TV PLAY Off - TV Play is a feature of Nintendo 's eighth - generation video game console , the Wii U. Like all video game consoles , the Wii U uses a console and a controller to manipulate an image on a television screen .
The Wii U 's unique feature is that its controller , the Wii U GamePad , has its own built - in screen for displaying images .
It can display an entirely different image , or duplicate the television screen into the Wii U GamePad .
Off - TV Play is the term used for when an entire game is played strictly on the controller , without the use of a television .
BACKGROUND Section::::Background .
The Wii U console was officially unveiled at E3 2011 in June 2011 , where it was first detailed that the console 's controller would feature a tablet - like touchscreen .
Nintendo announced that a major focus of the console would be the ability to display the image seen on the television on the touchscreen , to continue playing the game if the television was needed for other uses , or the player needed to move away from the television .
Official terms were given at E3 2012 ; the controller was named the Wii U GamePad and the concept of playing games strictly on its screen being labeled Off - TV Play .
For supported games , a television is n't required to be connected to the Wii U ; the Wii U can operate in Off - TV Play mode as long as the console is connected to a power source .
However , as the processing is done on the console , and transmitted to the GamePad , the user must still keep within the transmitting range in order for it to work .
Not all games support Off - TV Play , as some games conceptually rely on the asymmetric interplay between the television screen and the Wii U GamePad screen , such as Nintendo Land and ZombiU.
However , All Wii U Virtual Console titles purchased from the Nintendo eShop include the option to use Off - TV Play .
Original Wii games and Virtual Console games were not initially compatible either , although this was changed in the Wii U 's September 30 , 2013 system update , which allows it , but only through the use of original Wii peripherals as input methods , meaning that the image would appear on Wii U Gamepad screen , but its buttons would not work , requiring the use of Wii Remotes and Wii Nunchuks for button and joystick input .
This was partially revised again in January 2015 ; when Nintendo began releasing Wii games digitally on the Wii U eShop .
Because games re - released in this fashion were reworked to run straight from the Wii U operating screen , and not Wii Mode , the game allowed for Off TV Play on Wii games with GamePad controls , provided the game allowed for Classic Controller usage in its Wii release .

The concept has received mostly positive reviews .
The CNET praised the feature as being " nothing short of fantastic [ ... ] because it prevents the monopolization of a TV while gaming -- something anyone who does n't live alone can appreciate .
For those households where the main TV is in constant demand , off - TV sounds like a godsend . "
However , a major concern cited is that it was n't a required feature , meaning the developers can opt out of making it possible in their respective games , so in theory , it could become obsolete .
Kotaku praised it as well , stating that it is a good feature for those who like to multi - task , since it frees up the television for other uses .
TechSpot described it as " a luxury few people asked for but that turns out to be wonderful to have " .
Destructoid praised it for being exactly the same as playing on the television , only " with some limited portability for no extra charge .
Hard to find fault in that .
"
GamesRadar praised the feature for being perfect for the avid television watcher , but criticized the fact that there was n't a standardized way to activate it , such as its own button .
IGN stated in their review for the Wii U , that in regards to single player experiences , they preferred it when the entire game could be transferred to the GamePad over using it in conjunction with a television .
Some critics have argued that the image has superior quality while using Off - TV Play , while others have cited concerns over the small size of the screen making it difficult to see all the details of the image .
Eurogamer 's " Digital Foundry " testing showed that the Wii U 's Off - TV Play feature outperformed Sony 's similar Remote Play feature on its PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita systems in image quality , latency , frame - rate .
Pocket Gamer agreed , stating that Off - TV Play offered far less lag than Remote Play .
While critics generally praised the Wii U update enabling Off - TV Play support to original Wii software played in Wii Mode , they generally lamented the update 's shortcoming of requiring Wii controllers and peripherals to play rather than the Wii U GamePad itself .
This was partially rectified by Nintendo in January 2015 , when they announced that Wii games digitally re - released for the Wii U eShop would allow for GamePad controls , because they play directly through the Wii U , and not " Wii Mode " when using the disc version of the games .
