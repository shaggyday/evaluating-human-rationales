CAPER Capparis spinosa , the caper bush , also called Flinders rose , is a perennial plant that bears rounded , fleshy leaves and large white to pinkish - white flowers .
The plant is best known for the edible flower buds ( capers ) , often used as a seasoning , and the fruit ( caper berries ) , both of which are usually consumed pickled .
Other species of Capparis are also picked along with C. spinosa for their buds or fruits .
Other parts of Capparis plants are used in the manufacture of medicines and cosmetics .
Capparis spinosa is native to the Mediterranean .
It is endemic to almost all the circum - Mediterranean countries , and is included in the flora of most of them , but whether it is indigenous to this region is uncertain .
Although the flora of the Mediterranean region has considerable endemism , the caper bush could have originated in the tropics , and later been naturalized to the Mediterranean basin .
The taxonomic status of the species is controversial and unsettled .
Species within the genus Capparis are highly variable , and interspecific hybrids have been common throughout the evolutionary history of the genus .
As a result , some authors have considered C. spinosa to be composed of multiple distinct species , others that the taxon is a single species with multiple varieties or subspecies , or that the taxon C. spinosa is a hybrid between C. orientalis and C. sicula .
PLANT Section::::Plant .
The shrubby plant is many - branched , with alternate leaves , thick and shiny , round to ovate .
The flowers are complete , sweetly fragrant , and showy , with four sepals and four white to pinkish - white petals , and many long violet - colored stamens , and a single stigma usually rising well above the stamens .
ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS
Section::::Environmental requirements .
The caper bush requires a semiarid or arid climate .
The caper bush has developed a series of mechanisms that reduce the impact of high radiation levels , high daily temperature , and insufficient soil water during its growing period .
The caper bush has a curious reaction to sudden increases in humidity ; it forms wart - like pock marks across the leaf surface .
This is apparently harmless , as the plant quickly adjusts to the new conditions and produces unaffected leaves .
It also shows characteristics of a plant adapted to poor soils .
This shrub has a high root / shoot ratio and the presence of mycorrhizae serves to maximize the uptake of minerals in poor soils .
Different nitrogen - fixing bacterial strains have been isolated from the caper bush rhizosphere , playing a role in maintaining high reserves of that growth - limiting element .
CULTIVATION Section::::Cultivation .
The caper bush has been introduced as a specialized culture in some European countries in the last four decades .
The economic importance of the caper plant led to a significant increase in both the area under cultivation and production levels during the late 1980s .
The main production areas are in harsh environments found in Morocco , the southeastern Iberian Peninsula , Turkey , and the Italian islands of Pantelleria and Aeolian Islands , especially Salina .
This species has developed special mechanisms to survive in the Mediterranean conditions , and introduction in semiarid lands may help to prevent the disruption of the equilibrium of those fragile ecosystems .
A harvest duration of at least three months is necessary for profitability .
Intense daylight and a long growing period are necessary to secure high yields .
The caper bush can withstand temperatures over 40 ° C in summer , but it is sensitive to frost during its vegetative period .
A caper bush is able to survive low temperatures in the form of stump , as happens in the foothills of the Alps .
Caper plants are found even 3,500 m above sea level in Ladakh , though they are usually grown at lower altitudes .
Some Italian and Argentine plantings can withstand strong winds without problems , due to caper bush decumbent architecture and the coriaceous consistency of the leaves in some populations .
Scientists can use the known distributions of each species to identify the origin of commercially prepared capers .
The caper bush is a rupicolous species .
It is widespread on rocky areas and is grown on different soil associations , including alfisols , regosols , and lithosols .
In different Himalayan locations , C. spinosa tolerates both silty clay and sandy , rocky , or gravelly surface soils , with less than 1 % organic matter .
It grows on bare rocks , crevices , cracks , and sand dunes in Pakistan , in dry calcareous escarpments of the Adriatic region , in dry coastal ecosystems of Egypt , Libya , and Tunisia , in transitional zones between the littoral salt marsh and the coastal deserts of the Asian Red Sea coast , in the rocky arid bottoms of the Jordan valley , in calcareous sandstone cliffs at Ramat Aviv , Israel , and in central west and northwest coastal dunes of Australia .
It grows spontaneously in wall joints of antique Roman fortresses , on the Western Wall of Jerusalem 's Temple Mount , and on the ramparts of the castle of Santa Bárbara ( Alicante , Spain ) .
Clinging caper plants are dominant on the medieval limestone - made ramparts of Alcudia and the bastions of Palma ( Majorca , Spain ) .
This aggressive pioneering has brought about serious problems for the protection of monuments .
PROPAGATION Section::::Propagation .
Capers can be grown easily from fresh seeds gathered from ripe fruit and planted into well - drained seed - raising mix .
Seedlings appear in two to four weeks .
Old , stored seeds enter a state of dormancy and require cold stratification to germinate .
The viable embryos germinate within three to four days after partial removal of the lignified seed coats .
The seed coats and the mucilage surrounding the seeds may be ecological adaptations to avoid water loss and conserve seed viability during the dry season .
Use of stem cuttings avoids high variability in terms of production and quality .
Nevertheless , plants grown from cuttings are more susceptible to drought during the first years after planting .
The caper bush is a difficult - to - root woody species , and successful propagation requires careful consideration of biotypes and seasonal and environmental parameters .
Rootings up to 55 % are possible when using one - year - old wood , depending on cutting harvest time and substrate used .
Propagation from stem cuttings is the standard method for growing ' Mallorquina ' and ' Italiana ' in Spain , and ' Nocella ' in the Aolian Islands , esp .
Salina .
Hardwood cuttings vary in length from 15 to 50 cm and diameter of the cuttings may range from 1.0 to 2.5 cm .
Another possibility is to collect stems during February through the beginning of March , treat them with captan or captafol and stratify them outdoors or in a chamber at 3–4 ° C , covered with sand or plastic .
Moisture content and drainage should be carefully monitored and maintained until planting .
Using semihardwood cuttings , collected and planted during August and September , low survival rates ( under 30 % ) have been achieved .
Softwood cuttings are prepared in April from 25- to 30-day shoots .
Each cutting should contain at least two nodes and be six to 10 cm long .
Basal or subterminal cuttings are more successful than terminal ones .
Then , cuttings are planted in a greenhouse under a mist system with bottom heat ; 150 to 200 cuttings / m may be planted .
ORCHARD ESTABLISHMENT
Section::::Orchard establishment .
Mean annual temperatures in areas under cultivation are over 14 ° C and rainfall varies from 200 mm / year in Spain to 460 mm / year in Pantelleria and 680 mm / year in Salina .
In Pantelleria , it rains only 35 mm from May through August , and 84 mm in Salina , the Aeolian Islands .
A rainy spring and a hot dry summer are considered advantageous .
This drought - tolerant perennial plant is used for landscaping and reducing erosion along highways , steep rocky slopes , sand dunes or fragile semiarid ecosystems .
Caper plantings over 25 to 30 years old are still productive .
Thus , physical properties of the soil ( texture and depth ) are particularly important .
Caper bushes can develop extensive root systems and grow best on deep , nonstratified , medium - textured , loamy soils .
Mouldboard plowing and harrowing are usual practices prior to caper plant establishment .
Soil - profile modification practices , such as deep plowing operating 0.6 to 1 m , can ameliorate some restrictions .
In Pantelleria , digging backhoe pits for each shrub was found to be the most effective means of cultivating caper in rocky soils .
Two planting designs are used , the square / rectangle and the hedgerow system .
Spacing is determined by the vigour of the biotype , fertility of the soil , equipment used and the irrigation method , if any .
Bush spacing of 2.5 × 2.5 m or 2.5 × 2 m is common in Pantelleria .
In Salina , the Aeolian Islands , 3 × 3 m is satisfactory for ' Nocella ' .
In Spain , 4 × 4 m or 5 × 5 m is satisfactory for ' Mallorquina ' .
Spacing of 2.0 to 2.5 m is appropriate if C. spinosa is used to control soil erosion on slopes .
HARVEST Section::::Harvest .
Caper buds are usually picked in the morning .
Because the youngest , smallest buds fetch the highest prices , daily picking is typical .
Capers may be harvested from wild plants , in which case it is necessary to know that the plant is not one of the few poisonous Capparis species that look similar .
The plant normally has curved thorns that may scratch the people who harvest the buds , although a few spineless varieties have been developed .
CULINARY USES Section::::Culinary uses .
The salted and pickled caper bud ( called simply a caper ) is often used as a seasoning or garnish .
Capers are a common ingredient in Mediterranean cuisine , especially Cypriot , Italian , Aeolian and Maltese .
The mature fruit of the caper shrub are prepared similarly and marketed as caper berries .
The buds , when ready to pick , are a dark olive green and about the size of a fresh kernel of corn ( Zea mays ) .
They are picked , then pickled in salt , or a salt and vinegar solution , and drained .
Intense flavor , sometimes described as being similar to black pepper or mustard , is developed as mustard oil ( glucocapparin ) is released from each caper bud .
This enzymatic reaction leads to the formation of rutin , often seen as crystallized white spots on the surfaces of individual caper buds .
Capers are a distinctive ingredient in Italian cuisine , especially in Sicilian , Aeolian and southern Italian cooking .
They are commonly used in salads , pasta salads , meat dishes , and pasta sauces .
Examples of uses in Italian cuisine are chicken piccata and spaghetti alla puttanesca .
Capers are known for being one of the ingredients of tartar sauce .
They are often served with cold smoked salmon or cured salmon dishes ( especially lox and cream cheese ) .
Capers and caper berries are sometimes substituted for olives to garnish a martini .
Capers are categorized and sold by their size , defined as follows , with the smallest sizes being the most desirable : non - pareil ( up to 7 mm ) , surfines ( 7–8 mm ) , capucines ( 8–9 mm ) , capotes ( 9–11 mm ) , fines ( 11–13 mm ) , and grusas ( 14 + mm ) .
If the caper bud is not picked , it flowers and produces a caper berry .
The fruit can be pickled and then served as a Greek mezze .
Caper leaves , which are hard to find outside of Greece or Cyprus , are used particularly in salads and fish dishes .
They are pickled or boiled and preserved in jars with brine — like caper buds .
Dried caper leaves are also used as a substitute for rennet in the manufacturing of high - quality cheese .
NUTRITION Section::::Nutrition .
Canned , pickled capers are 84 % water , 5 % carbohydrates , 2 % protein , and 1 % fat ( table ) .
Preserved capers are often particularly high in sodium content .
In a typical serving of 28 grams ( one ounce ) , capers supply 6 calories and 35 % of the Daily Value ( DV ) for sodium , with no other nutrients in significant content .
In a 100 gram amount , the sodium content is 2960 mg or 197 % DV , with vitamin K ( 23 % DV ) , iron ( 13 % DV ) , and riboflavin ( 12 % DV ) also having appreciable levels ( table ) .
OTHER USES
Section::::Other uses .
Capers are sometimes used in cosmetics .
POLYPHENOLS Section::::Polyphenols .
Canned capers contain polyphenols , including the flavonoids quercetin ( 173 mg per 100 g ) and kaempferol ( 131 mg per 100 g ) , as well as anthocyanins .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The caper was used in ancient Greece as a carminative .
It is represented in archaeological levels in the form of carbonised seeds and rarely as flower buds and fruits from archaic and Classical antiquity contexts .
Athenaeus in Deipnosophistae pays a lot of attention to the caper , as do Pliny ( NH XIX , XLVIII.163 ) and Theophrastus .
Etymologically , the caper and its relatives in several European tongues can be traced back to Classical Latin capparis , " caper " , in turn borrowed from the Greek κάππαρις , kápparis , whose origin ( as that of the plant ) is unknown but is probably Asian .
Another theory links kápparis to the name of the island of Cyprus ( Κύπρος , Kýpros ) , where capers grow abundantly .
In Biblical times , the caper berry was apparently supposed to have aphrodisiac properties ; the Hebrew word aviyyonah ( אֲבִיּוֹנָה ) for caperberry is closely linked to the Hebrew root אבה ( avah ) , meaning " desire " .
The word occurs once in the Bible , in the book of Ecclesiastes , at verse .
The King James Version translates on the basis of the Hebrew root ( and perhaps the metaphorical meaning): ...
the grasshopper shall be a burden , and desire shall fail .
( KJV )
The medieval Jewish commentator Rashi also gives a similar gloss ( JPR ) .
However , ancient translations , including the Septuagint , Vulgate , Peshitta and Aquila , render the word more concretely as κάππαρις , " caper berry " .
Thus in the words of one modern idiomatic translation ( 2004) ...
the grasshopper loses its spring , and the caper berry has no effect ; ( HCSB ) Of other modern versions , the NIV goes for " desire " ( NIV ) , while the NASB has " caper - berry " ( NASB ) , as did the 1917 Jewish Publication Society version ( JPS ) .
The berries ( abiyyonot ) were eaten , as appears from their liability to tithes and to the restrictions of the ' Orlah .
They are carefully distinguished in the Mishnah and the Talmud from the caper leaves , alin , shoots , temarot , and the caper buds , capperisin ( note the similarity " caper"isin to " caper " ) ; all of which were eaten as seen from the blessing requirement , and declared to be the fruit of the ẓelaf or caper plant .
Talmud Bavli , Gemara Berachot , page 36 A&B , discusses the eating of caper sepals versus caper berries , both inside the land of Israel , outside the land of Israel , and in Syria .
Capers are mentioned as a spice in the Roman cookbook , Apicius .
ALTERNATIVES Section::::Alternatives .
Nasturtium , marigold , and Cassia buds have sometimes been used as a substitute .
