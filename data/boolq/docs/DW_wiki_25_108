AMAZON VIDEO Prime Video is an Internet video on demand service that is developed , owned , and operated by Amazon .
It offers television shows and films for rent or purchase and Prime Video , a selection of Amazon Studios original content and licensed acquisitions included in the Amazon 's Prime subscription .
In the UK , US , Germany , and Austria , access to Prime Video is also available through a video - only membership , which does not require a full Prime subscription .
In countries like France and Italy , Rent or Buy and Prime Video are not available on the Amazon website and Prime Video content is only accessible through a dedicated website .
In some countries Amazon Video additionally offers Amazon Channels , which allows viewers to subscribe to other suppliers ' content , including HBO in the United States .
Launched on September 7 , 2006 as Amazon Unbox in the United States , the service grew with its expanding library , and added the Prime Video membership with the development of Prime .
It was then renamed as Amazon Instant Video on Demand .
After acquiring the local streaming and DVD - by - mail service LoveFilm in 2011 , Prime Video was added to Prime in the United Kingdom , Germany and Austria in 2014 , a move that angered some Prime UK members as the bundling was non - negotiable with a 61 % increase in subscription fee .
In the UK , Germany , and Austria , Prime Video has been available on a monthly subscription of £ 5.99 or € 7.99 per month , continuing the plan of LoveFilm Instant .
The service was previously available in Norway , Denmark and Sweden in 2012 , but was discontinued in 2013 .
On April 18 , 2016 , Amazon split Prime Video from Amazon Prime in the US for $ 8.99 per month .
The service also hosts Amazon Original content alongside titles on Video as well .
On December 14 , 2016 , Amazon Video launched worldwide ( except for Mainland China , Cuba , Iran , North Korea , Syria ) expanding its reach beyond US , UK , Germany , Austria , and Japan .
Among the new territories , the service was included with Prime in Belgium , Canada , France , India , Italy , Spain , Poland , and Brazil , while for all other countries it was made available for a monthly promotional price of $ /€2.99 per month for the first six months and $ /€5.99 per month thereafter .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The service debuted on September 7 , 2006 as Amazon Unbox in the United States .
On September 4 , 2008 , the service was renamed Amazon Video on Demand .
As of August 2014 the service is no longer available for downloading purchased instant videos .
On February 22 , 2011 , the service rebranded as Amazon Instant Video and added access to 5,000 movies and TV shows for Amazon Prime members .
On September 4 , 2012 , Amazon signed a deal with pay - TV channel Epix to feature movies on their streaming service , in a move to rival their competitor Netflix .
Additionally , in November 2013 , Amazon premiered the comedies Alpha House and Betas , which are original series available exclusively online via the Prime Instant Video service .
Amazon offered the first three episodes of both series at once for free , with each subsequent episode released weekly thereafter for Prime members .
In February 2014 , Amazon announced that the streaming service of its UK subsidiary LoveFilm would be folded into the Instant Video service on February 26 , 2014 .
In January 2015 , Transparent became the first show produced by Amazon Studios to win a major award and the first series from a streaming video service to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy .
In 2015 , Amazon launched the Streaming Partners Program ( now known as Amazon Channels ) , a platform allowing subscription - based third - party channels and streaming services to be offered to Amazon Prime subscribers through the Amazon Video platform .
These services are separate from the Amazon Video offering , and must be purchased separately .
The original launch in the U.S. included services such as Curiosity Stream , Lifetime Movie Club , AMC 's Shudder , Showtime , Starz , and others .
The service subsequently added other partners , such as HBO and Cinemax , Fandor , PBS Kids , Seeso , Toku and Boomerang .
On July 30 , 2015 , Amazon announced that they had hired Jeremy Clarkson , Richard Hammond , and James May to produce an untitled motoring show for Amazon Prime Video that would later be named The Grand Tour .
Neither Jeff Bezos nor Amazon.com had stated how much Clarkson , Hammond , or May are being paid to produce the programme via their production company W. Chump & Sons , but Jeff Bezos stated that the deal was " very expensive , but worth it " .
The budget for the show has not officially been announced , but Andy Wilman , the former executive producer of Top Gear stated that each episode would have a budget of around £ 4.5 million , nine times larger than Top Gear 's budget .
Also in July , Amazon announced plans to expand the service into India .
In September 2015 the word " Instant " was dropped from its title in the US , and it was renamed simply Amazon Video .
In November 2016 , the Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon was pursuing streaming rights to U.S. professional sports leagues to further differentiate the service .
Amazon announced in November 2016 that it planned to stream The Grand Tour globally , which led to speculation over whether the full Amazon Video service would begin a wider international rollout to compete with Netflix .
On December 14 , 2016 , Amazon Video expanded into 200 additional countries .
In January 2017 , Amazon announced Anime Strike , an anime focused Amazon Channels service .
In May 2017 , Amazon Channels expanded into Germany and the UK ; in the UK , the company reached deals to offer channels from Discovery Communications ( including Eurosport ) , and live / on - demand content from ITV .
In April 2017 , Amazon began to make sports - related content acquisitions , first acquiring non - exclusive rights to stream portions of the NFL 's Thursday Night Football games during the 2017 NFL season to Prime subscribers in a $ 50 million deal , replacing a previous deal with Twitter .
In August , Amazon acquired the British television rights to the ATP World Tour beginning 2019 , replacing Sky Sports .
The deal will run until 2023 and will exclusively show all masters 1000 events and 12 500 and 250 series tournaments .
Amazon will be the third party pay TV provider for the ATP finals and starting in 2018 for Queens Club and Eastbourne tournaments .
The ATP announced a two - year deal in September for Amazon to stream the Next Generation ATP Finals .
In November it was announced that Amazon had acquired the British television rights to the US Open for five years from the 2018 edition , for a reported £ 30 million .
Eurosport who owned the pan European rights extended their deal with the US Open but excluded the UK , which was ironic as Amazon had reached a deal with the broadcaster to stream their channels on their station .
The ATP additionally announced that Amazon in the US would screen the tennis channel , Tennis TV from 2018 .
On January 5 , 2018 , Amazon announced that they will be terminating their Anime Strike and Heera services , merging their content with Prime Video .
In June 2018 , it was announced that Amazon had secured the rights to broadcast 20 live Premier League football matches from the 2019 - 20 season on a three - year deal .
The deal signifies a major shift in the way UK football fans will watch the Premier League , as this will be the first time that the league will be shown on a domestic live streaming service , as opposed to Premier League matches being shown exclusively on television .
Amazon Video , via sister company Amazon Studios , owns global television adaptation rights to The Lord of the Rings .
