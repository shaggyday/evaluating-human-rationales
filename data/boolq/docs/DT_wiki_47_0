ROSEANN QUINN Roseann Quinn ( November 17 , 1944 â€“ January 2 , 1973 ) was an American schoolteacher in New York City who was stabbed to death in 1973 .
Her murder inspired Judith Rossner 's best - selling 1975 novel Looking for Mr. Goodbar , which was adapted as a 1977 film directed by Richard Brooks and starring Diane Keaton .
Quinn 's murder also inspired the 1977 account by New York Times journalist Lacey Fosburgh .
The case was the subject of a Season 3 episode of Investigation Discovery 's series A Crime to Remember in 2015 ( " Last Night Stand " ) .
EARLY LIFE
Section::::Early life .
Quinn was born in 1944 in the Bronx to John and Roseann Quinn , Irish Americans .
She had three siblings : two brothers , John and Dennis , and a sister , Donna .
When she was 11 years old , her family moved to Mine Hill Township , near Dover , New Jersey .
John Quinn was an executive with Bell Laboratories in Parsippany - Troy Hills .
When she was 13 , Quinn spent a year in the hospital after a back operation ( due to scoliosis , see Arthur Gelb " City Room " ) , which left her with a slight limp .
She attended Morris Catholic High School in Denville , New Jersey , graduating in 1962 .
Her yearbook said that she was " Easy to meet ... nice to know . "
Quinn enrolled in Newark State Teachers College ( now Kean University ) .
CAREER
Section::::Career .
Quinn graduated in 1966 and soon moved to New York City , teaching for three years in Newark , New Jersey .
In September 1969 , she began teaching at St. Joseph 's School for the Deaf in the Bronx , where she taught a class of eight eight - year - olds .
Many times , she voluntarily stayed after school to help them , other teachers recalled .
" The students loved her , " a spokesman for the school would later say .
By May 1972 she had moved to a studio apartment at 253 West 72nd Street .
The building had been known as the Hotel West Pierre before being converted to apartments four years earlier .
According to her acquaintances and neighbors , Quinn would sit by herself and read at bars on the West Side .
Police Captain John M. McMahon later said that " she was an affable , outgoing , friendly girl .
Her friends were rather diverse .
She knew teachers and artists and her circle of friends was a very large , interracial group ...
She knew an awful lot of people . "
One friend who would later speak to the media said that she struck up a conversation with him by revealing that she had been reading his lips and following a conversation at the other end of the bar that she could n't otherwise have heard .
ALLEGED
DOUBLE LIFE Section::::Alleged double life .
Quinn reportedly developed a habit of meeting and taking home men .
Her next - door neighbor reported hearing screams coming from Quinn 's apartment .
Once she intervened and saw a man dashing out of Quinn 's apartment yelling obscenities ; she found Quinn disheveled and bruised , with a black eye , sobbing .
Quinn had been attending night courses at Hunter College , and by December 1972 had completed about half of her work toward her master 's degree in her specialty of teaching the deaf .
Later that month she attended the faculty Christmas party at St. Joseph 's School and a party for the children the next day .
MURDER Section::::Murder .
On the evening of New Year 's Day 1973 , Quinn went across the street from her apartment to a bar named W. M. Tweeds , where she met John Wayne Wilson .
Wilson 's friend , Geary Guest , left around 11:00 p.m. , before Wilson met Quinn .
Wilson and Quinn went to her apartment , where they smoked marijuana and attempted to have intercourse .
As Wilson would later tell his attorney , he was unable to achieve an erection .
He claimed that Quinn insulted him and demanded that he leave her apartment , and an argument ensued .
After a struggle , Wilson picked up a knife and , according to his police statement , stabbed Quinn 18 times in the neck and abdomen .
After the murder , he covered Quinn 's body with a bathrobe , showered , and left the apartment .
Before leaving , he wiped his fingerprints off the murder weapon , the door knobs and any other surface he might have touched .
Later that night , Wilson confessed the crime to Geary Guest .
Believing that Wilson was making this all up to get a plane ticket home , Geary gave him enough money to leave town .
Wilson first flew to Miami to pick up his wife , Kathy .
They later flew to Indiana .
Quinn 's body was not discovered until the morning of January 3 .
The authorities at St. Joseph 's School , alarmed that Quinn had not called or shown up for work in two days , sent a teacher to her apartment to check up on her .
The building 's superintendent , Amedio Gizzi , let the teacher into the apartment , where they found Quinn 's body .
Her 25-year - old brother , John , later identified the body at the morgue .
FUNERAL Section::::Funeral .
Quinn 's wake was held at Bermingham Funeral Home at 249 S. Main Street , Wharton , New Jersey .
Her funeral was held on January 6 , 1973 at St. Mary 's Church in Wharton , a mile from her family 's home in Mine Hill .
The funeral mass was led by Quinn 's cousin , the Rev. John Waldron of St. Teresa of Avila Church in Brooklyn .
She was buried at St. Mary 's Cemetery , a quarter of a mile from the church .
INVESTIGATION AND AFTERMATH Section::::Investigation and aftermath .
In the days before DNA evidence , there was little to connect Quinn and her killer .
No one at Tweeds knew the identity of the man she left with or could say what he looked like .
The crime scene had been effectively sanitized .
Desperate to crack a case that had been on the front pages for days , the New York City Police Department ( NYPD ) released a police sketch that ran in several New York newspapers on Sunday , January 7 , 1973 .
The sketch was not of the killer , but of the accountant Geary Guest .
Guest was still not sure Wilson had committed the murder until he saw Quinn 's name in the newspaper article .
Fearing he might be charged as an accessory after the fact , Guest first called his friends Fred Ebb and Gary Greenwood , Ebb 's personal assistant .
Guest told Ebb and Greenwood that he could not tell them about what had happened on the phone , but it was the worst thing anyone could be involved with .
He said he was going to California to see them and hung up .
He arrived at Ebb 's Bel - Air , Los Angeles , California home the next day ; there , he told Ebb and Greenwood about Wilson and the murder .
Guest said he had been out with Wilson and had left early because he had to go to work in the morning .
He said when he woke up , Wilson had not returned to the apartment , and Guest became worried .
Wilson subsequently arrived and confessed the murder to him , and Guest gave him money .
Ebb called Guest 's therapist , Hadassah , in New York ; she said she would contact an attorney and call him back as soon as possible .
Shortly thereafter , she and the attorney called back ; the attorney advised Ebb to put Guest on the first plane back to New York City .
He also advised Ebb and Greenwood not to say a word about what Guest had told them .
In mid - March , Ebb and Greenwood flew to New York City .
It took more than two weeks to convince Guest to talk to the police , as Guest agonized over the fact that his information could send his friend Wilson to prison for life or to death row .
Guest 's lawyer contacted the police and got Guest immunity in exchange for revealing Wilson 's location .
NYPD Detectives Patrick Toomey and John Lafferty of New York 's Fourth District Homicide Squad
flew to Indiana , where , accompanied by Indianapolis Police Sgt .
H. Greg Byrne , they arrested Wilson at his mother 's house in Indianapolis .
Wilson was brought back to New York and incarcerated in the Manhattan Detention Complex , known as the Tombs .
After spending some weeks in The Tombs , Wilson was sent to Bellevue Hospital Center on April 19 to be tested for childhood brain damage , which his attorney planned to claim as part of an insanity defense .
Wilson stayed at Bellevue for several weeks , but the tests were never administered , and he was eventually returned to The Tombs .
Though he had been diagnosed as suicidal , the cells for the suicide watch were full , so Wilson was placed in a regular cell on the fourth floor .
In May , Wilson got into an argument with a prison guard and threatened to kill himself .
The guard taunted him by asking if he wanted sheets to do it with and later threw bed sheets into his cell .
Wilson used those sheets to hang himself on May 5 , 1973 .
An investigation was held into the circumstances of Wilson 's death , but no charges were ever filed .
Feeling responsible for Wilson 's suicide , Guest had a black - out .
Ten days later , Ebb and Greenwood received a call from a mental institution just outside Phoenix , Arizona .
Guest had flown to Phoenix and checked himself in as a John Doe .
Shortly after Guest returned to New York City , the prosecuting attorney supposedly told him that if the case had gone to trial and Wilson was not convicted , murder charges would have been brought against Guest , though he was innocent .
