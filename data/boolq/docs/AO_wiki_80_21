UNO ( CARD GAME )
Uno (; from Italian and Spanish for ' one ' ;
stylized as UNO ) is an American shedding - type card game that is played with a specially printed deck .
The game 's general principles put it into the Crazy Eights family of card games .
The game was originally developed in 1971 by Merle Robbins in Reading , Ohio , a suburb of Cincinnati .
It has been a Mattel brand since 1992 .
When his family and friends began to play more and more , he spent $ 8,000 to have 5,000 copies of the game made .
He sold it from his barbershop at first , and local businesses began to sell it as well .
Robins later sold the rights to UNO to a group of friends headed by Robert Tezak , a funeral parlor owner in Joliet , Illinois , for $ 50,000 plus royalties of 10 cents per game .
Tezak formed International Games , Inc. , to market UNO , with offices behind his funeral parlor .
The games were produced by Lewis Saltzman of Saltzman Printers in Maywood , Illinois .
In 1992 , International Games became part of the Mattel family of companies .
There can be 2 - 10 players .
OFFICIAL RULES Section::::Official rules .
The aim of the game is to be the first player to score 500 points , achieved ( usually over several rounds of play ) by being the first to play all of one 's own cards and scoring points for the cards still held by the other players .
The deck consists of 108 cards : four each of " Wild " and " Wild Draw Four , " and 25 each of four different colors ( red , yellow , green , blue ) .
Each color consists of one zero , two each of 1 through 9 , and two each of " Skip , " " Draw Two , " and " Reverse .
" These last three types are known as " action cards . "
To start a hand , seven cards are dealt to each player , and the top card of the remaining deck is flipped over and set aside to begin the discard pile .
The player to the dealer 's left plays first unless the first card on the discard pile is an action or Wild card ( see below ) .
On a player 's turn , they must do one of the following : * play one card matching the discard in color , number , or symbol * play a Wild card , or a playable Wild Draw Four card ( see restriction below )
* draw the top card from the deck , then play it if possible Play proceeds clockwise around the table .
Action and Wild cards have the following effects : !
Card !
Effect when played from hand !
Effect as first discard * A player who draws from the deck must either play or keep that card and may play no other card from their hand on that turn .
* A player may play a Wild card at any time , even if that player has other playable cards .
* A player may play a Wild Draw Four card only if that player has no cards matching the current color .
The player may have cards of a different color matching the current number or symbol or a Wild card and still play the Wild Draw Four card .
A player who plays a Wild Draw Four may be challenged by the next player in sequence ( see Penalties ) to prove that their hand meets this condition .
*
If the entire deck is used during play , the top discard is set aside and the rest of the pile is shuffled to create a new deck .
Play then proceeds normally .
*
It is illegal to trade cards of any sort with another player .
A player who plays their next - to - last - card must call " Uno " as a warning to the other players .
The first player to get rid of their last card ( " going out " ) wins the hand and scores points for the cards held by the other players .
Number cards count their face value , all action cards count 20 , and Wild and Wild Draw Four cards count 50 .
If a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four card is played to go out , the next player in the sequence must draw the appropriate number of cards before the score is tallied .
The first player to score 500 points wins the game .
PENALTIES
*
If a player does not call " Uno " after laying down their next - to - last card and is caught before the next player in sequence takes a turn ( i.e. , plays a card from their hand , draws from the deck , or touches the discard pile ) , they must draw two cards as a penalty .
If the player is not caught in time ( subject to interpretation ) or remembers to call " Uno " before being caught , they suffer no penalty .
If a player falsely calls " Uno " while having multiple cards in their hand , they must draw two cards .
* If a player plays a Wild Draw Four card , the following player can challenge its use .
The player who used the Wild Draw Four must privately show their hand to the challenging player , in order to demonstrate that they had no matching colored cards .
If the challenge is correct , then the challenged player draws four cards instead .
If the challenge is wrong , then the challenger must draw six cards ; the four cards they were already required to draw plus two more cards .
TWO - PLAYER GAME Section::::Two - player game .
In a two - player game , the Reverse card acts like a Skip card ; when played , the other player misses a turn .
HOUSE RULES Section::::House rules .
The following house rules are suggested in the Uno rulebook , to alter the game :
* Progressive Uno : If a draw card is played , and the following player has the same card , they can play that card and " stack " the penalty , which adds to the current penalty and passes it to the following player .
* Seven - O : When a certain card is played , the player is able to trade hands with another player or with all players .
For example , the person who played the 7 card is able to switch all of their cards with another player ; the player who played the 0 card is able to make every player exchange all their cards to the next player .
* Jump -
In : If a player has exactly the same card ( both number and color ) as the top card of the discard pile , they may play it immediately , even if it is not their turn .
The game then continues as if that player had just taken their turn .
STRATEGIES
Section::::Strategies .
A strategy at Uno may be offensive ( aiming to go out ) , or defensive ( aiming to minimize the value of one 's hand , in the event that another player goes out , thus getting those points ) .
Part of the skill of playing Uno is knowing when to adopt an offensive or defensive strategy .
An offensive strategy would be holding on to Wild and Wild Draw Four cards because they can be played near the end of the hand in order to go out ( when it 's harder to play a matching card ) .
However , a defensive strategy would advise getting rid of such cards early , because they have a high point value .
A defensive strategy would advise playing a high card in order to reduce the point value of the hand .
However , an offensive strategy would suggest playing a 0 when the player wants to continue on the current color , because it is less likely to be matched by another 0 of a different color ( there is only one 0 of each color , but two of each 1–9 ) .
A player holding only one card is required to call out " Uno " or risk being penalized if caught .
A player who calls " Uno " risks being the target of concerted action by the other players , who may be able to use action cards to prevent that player from going out .
Depending on the level and seriousness of play , some players may deliberately avoid saying " Uno " , in the hope of avoiding detection and then going out on the next turn .
For this reason , it is useful to conceal how many cards are in your hand and to keep track of how many cards every other player holds .
Little has been published on the optimal strategy for the game of Uno .
Simulations of games may shed some light on the matter .
Attempts to reduce point count in a player 's hands can be " read " by other players if too transparent .
This information can be exploited by other players , and it follows that a mixed strategy may be more appropriate .
Some work has been done into the psychology of Uno as it relates to individual and group behavior .
Players may exhibit physical tells , in which a subtle , often repeated , cue inadvertently reveals their state of mind during a game .
Alternatively , they may change their playing style , switching from an aggressive card - shedding strategy to a more subdued one , or vice versa .
CARD AND DECK STYLES Section::::Card and deck styles .
The new Uno action cards bear symbols which denote their action , except for the Wild cards which still bear the word " Wild . "
Before the design change , such cards in English versions of the game had letters only .
Especially old English versions can be denoted by the absence of the white rim that surrounds the edge of most Uno cards .
Other versions use symbols and images in both old and new designs , especially ones with Wild cards that do not bear the word " Wild " .
The Xbox 360 version of the game uses the new English style of the cards .
There are also language - free versions of the newer styles that do not bear the word " Wild " but have the same styling .
There is a new version called " Uno Mod " where the cards have symbols instead of letters or numbers .
This version also comes in a red and white case .
It is one of several " Mod " games by Mattel , the others being Othello ( game ) Mod , Apples to Apples Mod , Phase 10 Mod , and Skip - Bo Mod . THEME PACKS Section::::Theme packs .
