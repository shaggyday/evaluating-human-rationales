JUMP STREET
21 Jump Street is an American police procedural television series that aired on the Fox network and in first run syndication from April 12 , 1987 , to April 27 , 1991 , with a total of 103 episodes .
The series focuses on a squad of youthful - looking undercover police officers investigating crimes in high schools , colleges , and other teenage venues .
It was originally going to be titled Jump Street Chapel , after the deconsecrated church building in which the unit has its headquarters , but was changed at Fox 's request so as not to mislead viewers into thinking it was a religious program .
Created by Patrick Hasburgh and Stephen J. Cannell , the series was produced by Patrick Hasburgh Productions and Stephen J. Cannell Productions in association with 20th Century Fox Television .
Executive Producers included Hasburgh , Cannell , Steve Beers and Bill Nuss .
The show was an early hit for the fledgling Fox network , and was created to attract a younger audience .
The final season aired in first - run syndication mainly on local Fox affiliates .
It was later rerun on the FX cable network from 1996 to 1998 .
The series provided a spark to Johnny Depp 's nascent acting career , garnering him national recognition as a teen idol .
Depp found this status irritating , but he continued on the series under his contract and was paid $ 45,000 per episode .
Eventually he was released from his contract after the fourth season .
A spin - off series , Booker , was produced for the character of Dennis Booker ( Richard Grieco ) ; it ran one season , from September 1989 to June 1990 .

Richard Grieco and Dustin Nguyen also have cameos in the 2014 film sequel 22 Jump Street .
PREMISE Section::::Premise .
The series focuses on a group of police officers headquartered at the eponymous address .
These officers are all young and have especially youthful appearances , which allows them to pass for teenagers .
Their assignments generally consist of undercover work in high schools or , less commonly , colleges , where they generally investigate drug trafficking and abuse .
The show 's plots cover issues such as alcoholism , hate crimes , drug abuse , homophobia , AIDS , child abuse and sexual promiscuity .
Similarly , each problem is often solved by the end of the hour - long episode , giving an implicit moral about the impact of a particular activity .
When the show originally aired , some episodes were followed immediately by public service announcements featuring cast members .

In August , 21 Jump Street became the first Fox series to win its timeslot against a Big three network series .
In the United Kingdom , it was shown on the similarly nascent , and interrelated ,
Sky One , which had yet to reach a sizeable audience .
BROADCAST HISTORY Section::::Broadcast history . !
Season ! !
Time Season 4 was the last season to air on the Fox network .
In commentary on the Season 5 DVD set , Peter DeLuise said that Fox had decided to cancel the show after Season 4 because the ratings had fallen below a set limit .
Following this season Johnny Depp and Dustin Nguyen left the show .
The departure of their characters was never explained in the narrative of the TV series , but in the movie it is explained that Hanson was transferred to the DEA and was later joined by Officer Penhall .
The Booker spin - off crossover episode , " Wheels and Deals Part One " , is included with 21 Jump Street 's syndication package , and is also included on the fourth season DVD set .
Officer Dean Garrett ( David Barry Gray ) makes his first appearance in " Everyday is Christmas " .
As it became harder for the original cast members to plausibly pass as high school students , his character and Officer Kati Rocky ( Alexandra Powers ) were intended to be " youthful " replacements , so the show could maintain its original premise of younger looking cops posing as high school students .
