CROW ( COMICS )
The Crow ( Eric ) is a fictional character and the protagonist of The Crow comic book series , originally created by American artist James O'Barr in 1989 .
The titular character is an undead vigilante brought back to life by a supernatural crow to avenge his murder and that of his fiancée .
The character has subsequently appeared in several feature films , a television series , and spin - off novels and comics .
In the various incarnations , films , and spin - offs , many people have taken on the Crow persona in order to avenge their own wrongful deaths .
In 2011 , IGN ranked the Crow 37th in the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes .
The Crow made his live - action debut in the 1994
The Crow portrayed by Brandon Lee .
Later , The Crow was portrayed by Mark Dacascos in the 1998 television series .
THE CROW ( BIRD ) Section::::The Crow ( bird ) .
The Crow is a supernatural bird that serves as the protagonist 's link between the living world and the realm of beyond .
The magical crow is capable of resurrecting people who have been murdered , so that the victims may be able to seek justice on the person or people responsible for their death .
This story is said to come from an old Native American legend .
During the person 's " rebirth " , the crow serves as a guide , helping the individual tap into his or her potential and assisting in tracking down the wrongdoers .
Other people do not see the crow , only the reborn , unless he wants it .
The Crow speaks to the reborn , often helping guide them to exact their revenge .
In the film adaptations , the crow is a real bird and if harmed or killed , the reborn becomes vulnerable .
However , the Crow also seems to be much more enduring than a regular bird and might possess some regeneration abilities ( e.g. in The Crow movie the bird survives after being shot with a rifle ) .
POWERS AND ABILITIES Section::::Powers and abilities .
While they are in possession of the Crow 's powers , the reborn are endowed with several unique abilities .
As they are already dead , the reborn are incapable of feeling pain or fatigue and possess a supernatural ability to recover from seemingly all injuries in a matter of moments .
Chief among their physical abilities is their inhuman strength and enhanced reflexes ; able to quickly brutalize several opponents simultaneously , even those who would be otherwise untouchable , as well as catch fast - moving projectiles such as throwing knives with their bare hands .
In both Wicked Prayer and Stairway to Heaven , the source of the reborn 's strength is attributed to their love for the ones they 've lost .
Alternatively , Ashe Corvin says in City of Angels that the fuel for his power is pain .
In either case , the Crow 's magic is rooted in lost love .
Also , again in the movies , the reborn possesses the ability to see images from his or her loved one 's memory when touching things he or she touched before , or to see the memories of a person when touching them .
In addition the reborn usually can send the images and feelings from the memories already absorbed to the person whose eyes the reborn touches at the moment ; in The Crow , protagonist Eric Draven makes villain Top Dollar feel 30 hours of his ( Eric 's ) murdered girlfriend Shelly 's pain in one moment .
In The Crow : Stairway to Heaven , Eric can see events that transpired simply by touching objects that belonged to someone .
Although the person brought back to life by the Crow is physically invulnerable , in the movies and later Crow comics they do have one weakness : they lose their power if the crow is harmed or killed .
In addition , the reborn lose their invincibility when they consider their mission completed ; in , protagonist Alex Corvis is tricked into thinking that he completed his mission , thus he becomes vulnerable .
However , his guide Crow makes Alex realize his mistake and rise again .
In the comic book The Crow : Waking Nightmares , it is stated that the Crow power is taken from the reborn if they abandon their mission .
In case of losing special powers the reborn become vulnerable , starts to rot , and rigor mortis sets in , as if the reborn were still in their graves .
In The Crow : City of Angels and The Crow : Salvation , those resurrected by the Crow have the ability to turn into crows themselves and possess the natural abilities of a crow , such as flight and night vision .
APPEARANCE Section::::Appearance .
In the comic book , the origin of Eric 's make - up is explained briefly as " painting his face in the colors of joy " .
This indicates that he copied the Greek comedy masquerade mask in his and Shelly 's house .
Contrary to the movie , in the book Eric does not paint his face with white .
The white pale color comes from the fact that Eric is dead , it 's just a corpse inhibited by a soul .
Joshua and Mark Leung do not wear any distinctive make - up , and Ashe 's is provided by Sarah , as in the movie .
Iris Shaw paints the semblance of a Crow on her face with the tail covering her nose , and the wings covering her eyes .
She removes it to face her final killer .
Michael Korby 's makeup covers his neck and shoulders .
The makeup is referred as " the mask of death " and " the trails of Gorgon 's blood " in comic book .
In , Jamie Osterberg 's pale skin color and eye / mouth lines are not created by make - up , however , and his hair has turned completely white .
In , Carrie 's pale skin color is not accomplished by make - up , there is no horizontal line over the mouth , and the vertical lines over the eyes are shorter and thinner .
In all feature films , except , the protagonist wears make - up that cover their face .
In the first movie Eric Draven copies the pattern from one of the masquerade that decorated his and Shelly 's apartment , which consists of white paint placed over the face with black paint around eyes , black vertical lines over and under eyes , black paint on the lips and a black horizontal line across the mouth and cheeks , resembling a Glasgow smile .
In The Crow : City of Angels Ashe 's make - up was provided by Sarah and looks similar .
Jimmy 's make - up in The Crow : Wicked Prayer is similar as well , though there is no horizontal line over the mouth and the vertical eye lines are shorter and thinner .
In the third movie , The Crow : Salvation , Alex Corvis is executed in the electric chair , and his face is burned by the metal helmet which was worn over his head during the execution .
He removes the burned skin following his resurrection , scarring his face around the eyes and lips , thus forming a pattern similar to the classical make - up .
However , there are two vertical lines over each of his eyes and they cross with the horizontal lines on his mouth .
In The Crow : Stairway to Heaven TV series , Eric 's " make - up " appears automatically whenever he " changes " into The Crow .
His fingernails become black , while his face becomes white , with vertical lines over the eyes and short horizontal / diagonal lines extending from his lips , like a smile ; they disappear when he becomes ' normal ' .
Even though not all the reborn wear make - up , they are still usually drawn in a certain style : their lips are usually distinctively black , skin around eyes is black , while the eyes are sometimes burning white .
Generally the style of drawing reminds the pattern of the classical makeup .
The resurrected souls in the Crow novels do not wear the traditional face paint / markings .
