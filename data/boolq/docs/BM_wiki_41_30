Mexico and the United States are widely considered as the two major powers of CONCACAF .
Matches between the two nations often attract much media attention , public interest and comment in both countries .
Although the first match was played in 1934 , their rivalry was not considered major until the 1980s , when the teams began to frequently compete in CONCACAF cups .
On 15 August 2012 , the United States defeated Mexico at Estadio Azteca in the first victory for the U.S. against Mexico on Mexican soil in 75 years .
Ever since their first meeting in 1934 , the two teams have met 67 times , with Mexico leading the overall series 34–18–15 ( W – L – D ) , outscoring the U.S. 138–79 .
However , since the 1990s , the tide began to change due to a rapid growth of soccer in the United States .
During this decade , Mexico continued to hold an edge over their arch - rivals but since the 2000s the series has favored the U.S. 13–7–6 ( W – L – D ) .
MEDIA COVERAGE Section::::Media coverage .

SUPPORTERS Section::::Supporters .
Mexico 's fans are infamously known for the chant " ¡ eeeh puto ! , " which is typically screamed when an opponent 's goalkeeper is about to perform a goalkick .
Due to the homophobic meaning of the word puto in Mexican Spanish ( a vulgar term for a male prostitute ) , the chant received negative attention in the 2014 FIFA World Cup .
Amid an investigation conducted on the subject by FIFA authorities , Mexico 's fans defended the chant by claiming that it was traditionally used in the Liga MX .
On 23 June 2014 , FIFA dropped the case against Mexico , concluding that the chant " was not considered insulting in the specific context . "
Nonetheless , Football Against Racism in Europe , a leading anti - discrimination organization , criticized FIFA 's ruling as " disappointing . "
