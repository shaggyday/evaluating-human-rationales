SUPER BOWL
XXXIX Super Bowl XXXIX was an American football game played between the American Football Conference ( AFC ) champion New England Patriots and the National Football Conference ( NFC ) champion Philadelphia Eagles to decide the National Football League ( NFL ) champion for the 2004 season .
The Patriots defeated the Eagles by the score of 24–21 .
The game was played on February 6 , 2005 , at Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville , Florida , the first time the Super Bowl was played in that city .
The Patriots , who entered the Super Bowl after compiling a 14–2 regular season record , became the first , and most recent ( as of Super Bowl LII ) , team since the 1997–1998 Denver Broncos to win consecutive Super Bowls .
New England also became the second team after the Dallas Cowboys to win three Super Bowls in four years .
The Eagles were making their second Super Bowl appearance after posting a 13–3 regular season record .
The game was close throughout , with the teams battling to a 14–14 tie by the end of the third quarter .
The Patriots then scored 10 points in the 4th quarter with Corey Dillon 's 2-yard touchdown run and Adam Vinatieri 's 22-yard field goal .
The Eagles then cut their deficit to 24–21 , with quarterback Donovan McNabb 's 30-yard touchdown pass to receiver Greg Lewis , with 1:48 remaining in the game but could not sustain the comeback .
Overall , New England forced four turnovers , while Patriots wide receiver Deion Branch was named Super Bowl MVP for recording 133 receiving yards and tied the Super Bowl record with 11 catches .
To avoid the possibility of an incident similar to the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show during the previous year , the league selected Paul McCartney as a " safe " choice to perform during Super Bowl XXXIX 's halftime .
The broadcast of the game on Fox was watched by an estimated 86 million viewers .
BACKGROUND Section::::Background .
NFL owners voted to award Super Bowl XXXIX to Jacksonville during their November 1 , 2000 meeting held in Atlanta .
PATRIOTS SEEK TO BECOME A DYNASTY
Section::::Patriots seek to become a dynasty .
New England finished the regular season with a record of 14–2 , bested only by the Steelers ' 15–1 mark , and ranking 7th in yards gained ( 5,773 ) and fourth in points scored ( 437 ) .
The Patriots ' major acquisition prior to the season was veteran running back Corey Dillon , who joined the team after playing 7 seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals .
In his first 6 seasons in the league , Dillon averaged over 1,250 rushing yards per year , including setting a single - game rushing record ( 278 yards , but has since been broken ) against the Denver Broncos on October 22 , 2000 .
In 2003 , however , injuries , conflicts with the Bengals ' management and coaching staff , and other off - field problems limited him to just 541 yards during the season .
By the end of the 2003 season , Dillon had lost his starting job to running back Rudi Johnson , and thus demanded to be traded .
Dillon became a significant offensive weapon for the 2004 Patriots , recording 1,635 rushing yards ( franchise record ) and 12 touchdowns , both career highs , and was named to the Pro Bowl for the fourth time in his career .
He also caught 15 passes for 103 yards and another touchdown .
His contributions helped lead the team to break the NFL record for the most consecutive regular season victories ( 18 ) , the record for the most consecutive overall victories ( 21 ) and earned the second best regular season record during the year at 14–2 .
The team 's only losses during the year were to the Pittsburgh Steelers , who ended up with the league 's best regular season record at 15–1 , and a 29–28 loss to the Miami Dolphins on ABC 's Monday Night Football .
Another weapon in the Patriots ' offensive backfield was running back Kevin Faulk , who rushed for 255 yards , recorded 26 receptions for 248 yards , returned 20 punts for 113 yards , returned 4 kickoffs for 73 yards , and scored 3 total touchdowns .
Fullback Patrick Pass also emerged as a big contributor , rushing for 141 yards , catching 28 passes for 215 yards , and gaining another 115 yards on kickoff returns .
Pro Bowl quarterback Tom Brady remained at the helm of the Patriots offense , completing 288 out of 474 ( 60.8 percent ) of his passes for 3,692 yards , 28 touchdowns , and 14 interceptions .
Although wide receiver Deion Branch , New England 's major deep threat , missed most of the season because of injuries , he did record 35 receptions for 454 yards and 4 touchdowns .
Wide receiver David Givens ended up being the team 's leading receiver with 56 catches for 874 yards and 3 touchdowns .
Wide receiver David Patten also contributed with 44 receptions for 800 yards and 7 touchdowns , and tight end Daniel Graham had 30 receptions for 364 yards and 7 touchdowns .
On special teams , pro bowl kicker Adam Vinatieri had the best season of his career , leading the NFL in field goals made ( 31 ) , field goal percentage ( 93.9 ) and scoring ( 141 points )
On defense , the Patriots were plagued by injuries , especially in their secondary .
Defensive backs Tyrone Poole and Ty Law suffered season - ending injuries , while safety Eugene Wilson , who led the team with 4 interceptions , missed several games .
In order to compensate for the losses , the following players were promoted to starters :
* Rookie cornerback Randall Gay , who did not play at all in the first 3 games of the season , and did not start until the 6th week .
* Cornerback Asante Samuel , who normally only played in dime formations .
* Safety Earthwind Moreland , who came off of the team 's practice squad and had only played in three games in his entire 5-year NFL career .
* Veteran wide receiver Troy Brown .
Head Coach Bill Belichick used Brown in the secondary during training camp , gave him playing time there during the preseason and saw Brown did very well .
With their patchwork secondary , the Patriots ranked just 17th in passing yards allowed ( 3,400 ) and 22nd in completions allowed ( 315 ) .
However , they did rank 7th in interceptions ( 20 ) and 10th in fewest passing touchdowns allowed ( 18 ) .
Most importantly , New England continued to win despite the injuries .
Brown actually turned out to be very effective playing as a defensive back , ranking second on the team with 3 interceptions .
Safety Rodney Harrison was also an impact player , leading the team with 138 tackles while also recording 3 sacks and 2 interceptions .
Up front , the Patriots ' defensive line was anchored by Pro Bowler Richard Seymour , who recorded 5 sacks and 1 fumble recovery .
New England also still had their trio of impact veteran linebackers :
Pro Bowler Tedy Bruschi ( 122 tackles , 3.5 sacks , 3 interceptions , and 70 return yards ) , Willie McGinest ( 9.5 sacks , 1 fumble recovery , and 1 interception ) , and Mike Vrabel ( 71 tackles and 5.5 sacks ) , along with Ted Johnson .
Vrabel also frequently played at the tight end position during offensive plays near the opponent 's goal line , recording 2 touchdown receptions .
EAGLES RETURN TO THE SUPER BOWL Section::::Eagles return to the Super Bowl .
The Eagles gained the 2004 NFC Super Bowl berth after 3 consecutive defeats in the NFC Championship Game to the St. Louis Rams , Tampa Bay Buccaneers ( who won Super Bowl XXXVII that year ) , and Carolina Panthers , respectively .
The Eagles hired Andy Reid as their head coach in 1999 following two straight losing seasons .
That same year , they used their first - round pick in the NFL draft ( the second overall ) to select quarterback Donovan McNabb .
Although they finished the 1999 regular season with a 5–11 record , they became a playoff team in 2000 , with McNabb throwing for 3,365 yards and 21 touchdowns while also rushing for 629 yards and another 6 touchdowns .
The Eagles achieved the best regular season record in the conference during the combined 2001 , 2002 , and 2003 seasons with a total of 35 wins out of 48 games , but lost the NFC Championship Game in each of those 3 years .
Prior to the 2004 season , the Eagles traded for wide receiver Terrell Owens to be the impact player to help get them to the Super Bowl .
Owens joined the team after 8 seasons with the San Francisco 49ers .
McNabb had the best season of his career in 2004 , completing 300 out of 469 ( 64 percent ) passes for 3,875 yards , 31 touchdowns , and 8 interceptions , making him the first quarterback to ever throw for more than 30 touchdowns and fewer than 10 interceptions in a season .
He also rushed for 220 yards and 3 touchdowns .
Wide receiver Todd Pinkston was also a reliable target , recording 36 catches for 676 yards .
Philadelphia 's running game was not as strong as their passing attack , ranking just 24th in the league in rushing yards ( 1,639 ) .
Running back Brian Westbrook led the team with 812 rushing yards and 3 touchdowns , however he also led all NFL running backs in receiving with 73 receptions for 706 yards and 6 touchdowns .
Veteran running back Dorsey Levens was also a big contributor with 410 rushing yards .
The Eagles ' offensive line was led by Pro Bowl tackles Tra Thomas and Jon Runyan and center Hank Fraley .
Three of their four starters in the defensive secondary were named to the Pro Bowl : Cornerback Lito Sheppard ( 1 sack , 5 interceptions , 172 return yards and 2 touchdowns ) , safety Michael Lewis ( 88 tackles , 2 forced fumbles , 1 sack , and 1 interception ) and safety Brian Dawkins ( 3 sacks , 2 forced fumbles , 1 fumble recovery , and 4 interceptions for 40 return yards ) , while their fourth starter , cornerback Sheldon Brown , also enjoyed a solid year ( 89 tackles , 3 sacks , 1 forced fumble , and 2 interceptions ) .
Their defensive line was anchored by Pro Bowl defensive tackle Corey Simon ( 5.5 sacks ) and defensive ends Jevon Kearse ( 7.5 sacks , Pro Bowl ) and Derrick Burgess .
Pro Bowl middle linebacker Jeremiah Trotter , who only started 9 games , recorded 69 tackles and 1 sack .
The Eagles started the 2004 regular season with seven straight wins before suffering a loss to the 15 - 1 Steelers .
After that , they finished the season with a 13–3 record .
Their only other 2 losses were in their last 2 games of the season , when they decided to rest all of their starters because they had already clinched the NFC # 1 seed , and thus home - field advantage in the playoffs .
However , during a December 19 , 12–7 win over the Dallas Cowboys , Owens was seriously injured on a " horse - collar tackle " by Cowboys defensive back Roy Williams and had to miss the rest of the regular season and the playoffs .
PLAYOFFS Section::::Playoffs .
Despite the loss of Owens , the Eagles beat the Minnesota Vikings , 27–14 , and the Atlanta Falcons , 27–10 , in the playoffs with relative ease .
McNabb recorded 21 out of 33 completions for 286 yards and two touchdowns , while receiver Freddie Mitchell scored two touchdowns in the victory over the Vikings .
Although Minnesota quarterback Daunte Culpepper threw for 316 yards , the Eagles defense recorded 2 interceptions , 2 sacks , and a forced fumble .
McNabb then completed 17 out of 26 passes for 180 yards and two touchdowns in the win over the Falcons .
The Eagles defense held dual - threat quarterback Michael Vick to only 136 passing yards , 26 rushing yards , and no touchdowns , while also recording an interception , 4 sacks , and a forced fumble on Vick .
McNabb had an average passer rating of 111.3 in the two games , with 466 passing yards , 35 rushing yards , 4 touchdowns , and no turnovers .
Safety Brian Dawkins was also an important player , recording a sack and a forced fumble against the Vikings , followed by an interception and a forced fumble against the Falcons in the NFC Championship Game .
Meanwhile , the Patriots defeated the Indianapolis Colts , 20–3 , holding the league 's highest scoring team with 522 total points to just one field goal , Indianapolis ' lowest point total since their opening game of the 2003 season .
Colts quarterback Peyton Manning threw for 4,557 yards during the regular season , and set NFL records for most touchdown passes in a regular season ( 49 ) and highest quarterback rating ( 121.4 ) .
The Patriots then defeated the first seeded Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship Game , 41–27 .
Although Pittsburgh had beaten New England , 34–20 , during the regular season and led the league in fewest total yards allowed , they could not stop the Patriots .
Brady threw for 207 yards and 2 touchdowns ; Dillon rushed for 73 yards and a touchdown ; and Branch , who was coming off of his injuries , recorded 4 receptions for 116 yards and a touchdown , along with 37 rushing yards and another touchdown on 2 carries .
SUPER BOWL
PREGAME NEWS
Section::::Super Bowl pregame news .
Owens was cleared to play in Super Bowl XXXIX , defying doctors orders by playing on his injured ankle containing 2 screws and a metal plate .
The other major story was the Patriots ' potential loss of both their offensive coordinator and defensive coordinator at the end of the season , and how it might affect the team in 2005 .
On December 12 , 2004 , about a month and a half before the game , New England offensive coordinator Charlie Weis signed a contract to become the head coach of Notre Dame starting in the 2005 season .
Due to injuries at the tight end spot , the Eagles were forced to sign Jeff Thomason , a former tight end who was working construction at the time , to a one - game contract for the Super Bowl .
Thomason saw time during several plays , although never had a ball thrown his way .
This was his third Super Bowl , playing in two with the Green Bay Packers during Andy Reid 's days as a Packer assistant .
With this appearance the Patriots became the 8th team to make it to the Super Bowl for the 5th time .
They joined the Dallas Cowboys , Denver Broncos , Pittsburgh Steelers , San Francisco 49ers , Miami Dolphins , Washington Redskins , and Oakland / Los Angeles Raiders .
They would be joined by the Green Bay Packers in 2011 and the New York Giants in 2012 .
The Eagles were trying to win their first NFL title since 1960 and the first championship for the city of Philadelphia since Moses Malone 's " fo ' , fi ' , fo ' " during the 76ers run to the NBA Championship .
With President George W. Bush being inaugurated for a second time in January , the Eagles were also trying to end a losing streak — teams in the city of Philadelphia had lost six straight championships during presidential inauguration years , beginning with the 76ers loss in .
The streak included the Eagles in Super Bowl XV in 1981 .
1989 was not included in that streak , but 1977 , 1981 , 1985 ( Flyers ) , 1993 ( Phillies ) , 1997 ( Flyers ) , and 2001 ( 76ers ) were .

GAME SUMMARY
FIRST QUARTER Section::::Game summary .
Section::::First Quarter .
On the first drive of the game , Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb fumbled while being sacked by New England linebacker Willie McGinest , and the Patriots recovered the ball at Philadelphia 's 34-yard line .
Eagles ' coach Andy Reid 's instant replay challenge overruled the fumble ; officials ruled that McNabb had been down by contact before the ball came out of his hands .
Later in the quarter after each team had punted twice , McNabb completed a 30-yard pass to Terrell Owens , with a roughing the passer penalty adding 9 yards , moving the ball inside the Patriots 20-yard line .
However , linebacker Mike Vrabel sacked McNabb for a 16-yard loss on the next play .
On the following play , the Eagles once again appeared to turn the ball over : McNabb 's pass was intercepted in the end zone by Patriots defensive back Asante Samuel , but it was nullified by an illegal contact penalty on linebacker Roman Phifer , moving the ball back inside the 20 and giving the Eagles a first down .
However , McNabb 's second chance was wasted as he threw an interception to safety Rodney Harrison on the next play .
This was Donovan McNabb 's first red zone interception of the season .
The Eagles defense then forced New England to a three - and - out on their ensuing possession , and Philadelphia got great field position by receiving the punt at the Patriots 45-yard line .
But once again , they gave up another turnover :
tight end L. J. Smith lost a fumble while being tackled by defensive back Randall Gay , and Eugene Wilson recovered the ball at the 38 .
SECOND QUARTER Section::::Second Quarter .
The Eagles defense once again forced New England to punt , and got the ball back at their own 19-yard line .
Aided by a pair of completions from McNabb to wide receiver Todd Pinkston for gains of 17 and 40 yards , the Eagles drove 81 yards in nine plays and scored on McNabb 's six - yard touchdown pass to Tight End LJ Smith , taking a 7–0 lead with 9:55 left in the second quarter .
It was the first time New England trailed during the entire postseason .
On their ensuing drive , the Patriots moved the ball to the Eagles four - yard line , mainly on plays by running back Corey Dillon , who caught two screen passes for 29 yards and rushed for 25 .
But quarterback Tom Brady fumbled the ball on a fake handoff Play - action pass and Philadelphia defender Darwin Walker recovered it .
However , the Eagles could not take advantage of the turnover and had to punt after 3 plays .
Eagles punter Dirk Johnson 's punt went just 29 yards , giving the Patriots the ball at Philadelphia 's 37-yard line .
The Patriots then drove 37 yards to score on Brady 's 4-yard pass to receiver David Givens with 1:10 remaining in the period , tying the game 7–7 by halftime .
It was only the second halftime tie in Super Bowl history and the first time both of the game 's first two quarters ended tied .
THIRD QUARTER Section::::Third Quarter .
On the opening drive of the second half , Patriots wide receiver Deion Branch caught 4 passes for 71 yards on a drive that ended with Brady 's 2-yard touchdown pass to Vrabel , who lined up at the tight end spot on the play .
The Eagles later tied the game with 3:39 left in the third period with a 74-yard , 10-play drive that was capped by McNabb 's 10-yard touchdown pass to running back Brian Westbrook .
For the first time in Super Bowl history , the game was tied going into the fourth quarter .
FOURTH
QUARTER Section::::Fourth Quarter .
Early in the final period , the Patriots put together a 9-play , 66-yard scoring drive that was keyed by 3 plays from running back Kevin Faulk , who caught 2 passes for 27 combined yards and rushed once for 12 .
Dillon capped off the drive with a 2-yard touchdown run to give the Patriots a 21–14 lead .
Then after forcing another Eagles punt , Branch made a spectacular catch , taking the ball out of the hands of cornerback Sheldon Brown .
The 19 yard gain , and a roughing - the - passer penalty on Philadelphia defensive lineman Corey Simon on the same play , set up kicker Adam Vinatieri 's 22-yard field goal with 8:43 left in the game to increase the score 24–14 in favor of New England .
In all three Patriots ' Super Bowl wins in the decade , they held a double digit lead in the 4th quarter .
The Eagles responded with a long McNabb completion to Owens .
However , after reaching the New England 36-yard line , McNabb fired a pass over the head of Dorsey Levens , where Tedy Bruschi was waiting to intercept it at the Patriots 24-yard line .
At this point , there was only 7:20 to play in the game , with the Patriots still up by 10 points .
The Eagles did force New England to punt , and got the ball back at their own 21-yard line , but with 5:40 left in the game .
The Eagles then drove 79 yards in 13 plays , however they used a full huddle for the entire drive .
McNabb 's 30-yard touchdown pass to receiver Greg Lewis cut the deficit to 24 - 21 .
Because the Eagles used a full huddle , the drive consumed 3:52 of the clock , and only 1:48 remained in the game by the time Lewis scored .
Because of this , many sportswriters later criticized the Eagles for not immediately going to a no - huddle offense at the start of the possession .
Anecdotal reports later came out alleging that McNabb was suffering from dry - heaves , and teammates Jon Ritchie and Lito Sheppard have gone on record years later that McNabb was suffering from dry - heaves or vomiting , though no video evidence exists and the stories have not been confirmed .
Hank Fraley said in an interview the day after the game that McNabb was " almost puking " due to two large hits from Tedy Bruschi and Jarvis Green on back - to - back plays .
McNabb himself denies that he was vomiting or dry - heaving during the final drive , and Brian Westbrook later claimed that McNabb was merely " coughing . "
The Eagles failed to recover their ensuing onside kick attempt , with Christian Fauria catching the ball cleanly and sliding down to seal possession for New England .
The Patriots then played it safe by running the ball 3 times and forcing Philadelphia to use all of its timeouts .
New England punter Josh Miller then pinned the Eagles back at their own 4-yard line with just 46 seconds left in the game .
Philadelphia then tried one last desperate drive to win or tie the game .
But on first down , McNabb was pressured into making a rushed pass to Westbrook at the line of scrimmage .
Instead of dropping the pass to stop the clock , Westbrook made the mistake of catching the ball and was immediately tackled for no gain , keeping the clock running and forcing the Eagles to run back to the line of scrimmage for their next play with no huddle .
On second down , McNabb threw an incomplete pass intended for Owens .
Finally on third down , McNabb threw a pass that deflected off of the outstretched fingertips of Smith and into the arms of Harrison for an interception with nine seconds left .
Tom Brady took a knee to run out the clock , clinching the 3rd Super Bowl title in 4 years for the Patriots , and in the eyes of many establishing themselves as a dynasty .
BOX SCORE STATISTICAL OVERVIEW Section::::Statistical overview .
McNabb completed 30 out of 51 passes for 357 yards and 3 touchdowns , but threw 3 interceptions and was sacked four times .
McNabb 's 357 yards are tied with Joe Montana for the seventh most in Super Bowl history and third most of any quarterback , as Tom Brady holds both the top and number 2 spot , with 505 yards in Super Bowl LII and 468 yards in Super Bowl LI .
Westbrook was the Eagles leading rusher with 44 yards , while also catching 6 passes for 70 yards and a touchdown and returning 3 punts for 19 yards .
Pinkston caught 4 passes for 82 yards , while Owens was the Eagles ' top receiver with 9 catches for 122 yards , however neither of them scored a touchdown .
Brady completed 23 out of 33 passes for 236 yards and 2 touchdowns .
Dillon was the top rusher of the game with 75 yards and a touchdown , and had 3 catches for 31 yards .
Running back Kevin Faulk contributed 38 rushing yards and 27 receiving yards .
Branch 's Super Bowl record 11 catches tied Cincinnati Bengals ' Dan Ross in Super Bowl XVI and San Francisco 49ers ' Jerry Rice in Super Bowl XXIII .
Coincidentally , all three would later be traded to the Seattle Seahawks :
Ross in 1985 , Rice in 2004 and Branch in 2006 .
Branch 's combined 21 catches in Super Bowls XXXVIII and XXXIX are the most in back - to - back Super Bowls .
Branch also became the third offensive player ever to win Super Bowl MVP honors without scoring a touchdown or throwing a touchdown pass .
The other two players were Joe Namath in Super Bowl III and Fred Biletnikoff in Super Bowl XI .
Branch and Terrell Owens each had 100 yards receiving , marking the third time in Super Bowl history , one player from each team had over 100 yards in a Super Bowl .
Michael Irvin and Andre Reed were the first in Super Bowl XXVII , and Branch and Muhsin Muhammad the second a year earlier in Super Bowl XXXVIII .
Branch also became the fourth player to have at least 100 yards receiving in back - to - back Super Bowls , joining John Stallworth , Jerry Rice and Antonio Freeman .
Also , Mike Vrabel and David Givens became just the 14th and 15th players to score a touchdown in consecutive Super Bowls .
Vrabel is the most surprising person on this list because he is a linebacker and he scored his on offense .
They also became just the 7th and 8th players to catch a touchdown in back - to - back Super Bowls .
With the victory , Tom Brady became just the fourth quarterback to win at least three Super Bowls , along with Terry Bradshaw , Joe Montana and Troy Aikman .
Brady also became the fourth quarterback to throw a touchdown pass in three different Super Bowls .
Other quarterbacks to do it were Terry Bradshaw , Joe Montana and John Elway , with Kurt Warner later accomplishing the feat during Super Bowl XLIII and Peyton Manning in Super Bowl XLVIII .
The Patriots joined the Dallas Cowboys as the only teams in NFL history to win three Super Bowls in a span of four years .
AFTERMATH Section::::Aftermath .
The Patriots ' Super Bowl win was the third championship for Boston - area sports teams in 12 months , following the Patriots winning Super Bowl XXXVIII the year before and the Red Sox winning the World Series – first in 86 years – three months earlier .
This marked the first time since 1989–1990 in the San Francisco Bay Area that the same market has had 2 Super Bowl and World Series winners in 12 months .
The Patriots would later appear in Super Bowl XLII and Super Bowl XLVI , losing both to Eli Manning 's New York Giants , before winning Super Bowl XLIX against the Seattle Seahawks , 28–24 , ten years later and Super Bowl LI against the Atlanta Falcons , 34 - 28 , two years later .
The latest Super Bowl win for the Patriots makes it ten titles among the four Boston teams ( 5 by the Patriots , 3 by the Red Sox , and one each by the Celtics and Bruins ) since 2002 .
With the Eagles ' loss , the city of Philadelphia 's sports championship drought continued ( no Philly - based pro sports team since the 1983 Sixers won the NBA title ) until the Phillies won the 2008 World Series .
The Eagles did not return to the Super Bowl until 2017 , also with a 13 - 3 record , when they beat the Falcons and Vikings in the reverse order that they did in the 2004 - 05 playoffs .
They exacted revenge on New England in Super Bowl LII , edging them 41–33 .
This is the last time that a team has won back - to - back Super Bowls , with the Patriots losing their second playoff game a year later and then , for the next eight years , every team either losing their first playoff game or missing them altogether .
The streak was broken in 2014 when the Seahawks defeated the Panthers and ultimately advanced to the Super Bowl , only to lose to a Patriots goal line stand .
The next year , the Patriots , having faltered down the stretch , entered those playoffs as the second seed behind the Broncos , who then defeated New England in the AFC Title Game that year en route to a title of their own in Super Bowl 50 .
Two years later , the Patriots , defending champions themselves from Super Bowl LI , returned to repeat their title only to lose the aforementioned Super Bowl LII .

One ad that drew the ire of many — including the NFL — was for the internet domain provider Go Daddy , which tweaked the controversial halftime of the previous year 's game with a mock censorship hearing featuring a comely woman , Nikki Cappelli ( played by WWE Wrestler Candice Michelle ) , having a " wardrobe malfunction " .
Fox pulled the second airing of the ad , scheduled for the two - minute warning of the fourth quarter , along with a five - second plug , and it was replaced with a promo for The Simpsons .
The Scottsdale , Arizona - based World Wide Web domain registration company got a refund on the second ad .
Another popular ad was made by the NFL .
It featured players who were not in the Super Bowl , headlined by Pittsburgh Steelers rookie quarterback Ben Roethlisberger being at a beach resort , depressed he did not make it in .
Joe Montana comforted Roethlisberger , and soon both Montana and Roethlisberger joined many other players in different locations in an off - key yet rousing edition of " Tomorrow " from the musical Annie .
The commercial ended with the tagline : " Tomorrow , we 're all undefeated again . "
Roethlisberger went on to lead the Steelers to victory in Super Bowl XL the very next season .
The top ad , as chosen by the USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter was for Anheuser - Busch 's Bud Light featuring a timid skydiver making his first jump getting enticed with a six - pack of the product .
This ad was ranked second on ADBOWL .
The highest ranked commercial by ADBOWL was Anheuser - Busch 's " Applause .
" For the first time since the campaign started in Super Bowl XXI , no " I 'm going to Disney World ! "
ad aired following Super Bowl XXXIX .
PLAYER BONUSES Section::::Player bonuses .
Each member of the Patriots received a payment of $ 68,000 for winning the game .
The Eagles each received $ 36,500 .
When adjusted for inflation , the Patriots salary was actually less than the $ 15,000 paid to members of the Green Bay Packers for winning Super Bowl I in 1967 .
That amount of money in 1967 equated to approximately $ 85,000 in 2005 .
