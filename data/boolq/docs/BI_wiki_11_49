HANNIBAL ( FILM )
Hannibal is a 2001 American psychological horror thriller film directed by Ridley Scott , adapted from Thomas Harris 's 1999 novel of the same name .
It is the sequel to the 1991 Academy Award – winning film The Silence of the Lambs in which Anthony Hopkins returns to his role as the serial killer , Hannibal Lecter .
Julianne Moore co - stars , in the role first held by Jodie Foster , as FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling .
The film had a difficult and occasionally troubling pre - production history .
When the novel was published in 1999 , The Silence of the Lambs director Jonathan Demme , screenwriter Ted Tally , and actress Jodie Foster all declined to be involved in its adaptation .
Ridley Scott became attached as director after the success of Gladiator ( 2000 ) , and eventually signed onto the project after reading the script pitched by Dino De Laurentiis , who produced Manhunter ( 1986 ) , based on the 1981 Harris novel Red Dragon .
After the departure of Foster and screenwriter Tally , Julianne Moore took on Foster 's role while David Mamet and Steven Zaillian wrote the screenplay .
Set ten years after The Silence of the Lambs , Hannibal follows Starling 's attempts to apprehend Lecter before his surviving victim , Mason Verger , captures him .
It is set in Italy and the United States .
The novel Hannibal drew attention for its violence .
Hannibal broke box office records in the United States , Australia , Canada and the United Kingdom in February 2001 , but was met with a mixed critical reception .
PLOT Section::::Plot .
Ten years after tracking down serial killer Jame Gumb , FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling is unjustly blamed for a botched drug raid .
She is later contacted by Mason Verger , the only surviving victim of the serial killer Hannibal Lecter .
A wealthy child molester , Verger was paralyzed and brutally disfigured by Lecter during a therapy session .
He has been pursuing an elaborate scheme to capture , torture , and kill Lecter ever since .
Using his wealth and political influence , Verger has Starling reassigned to Lecter 's case , hoping her involvement will draw Lecter out .
After learning of Starling 's public disgrace , Lecter sends her a taunting letter .
Starling detects a strange fragrance from the letter .
A perfume expert later identifies a skin cream whose ingredients are only available to a few shops in the world .
She contacts the police departments of the cities where the shops are located , requesting surveillance tapes .
In Florence , one of those cities , Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi is investigating the disappearance of a library curator .
Pazzi questions Lecter , who is masquerading as Dr. Fell , the assistant curator and caretaker .
Upon recognizing Dr. Fell in the surveillance tape , Pazzi accesses the ViCAP database of wanted fugitives .
He then learns of Verger 's US$ 3 million personal bounty on Lecter .
Blinded by greed , Pazzi ignores Starling 's warnings and attempts to capture Lecter alone .
He recruits a pickpocket to obtain Lecter 's fingerprint to show Verger as proof .
The pickpocket , mortally wounded by Lecter , manages to get the print and gives it to Pazzi .
Lecter baits Pazzi into an isolated room of the Palazzo Vecchio , ties him up , then disembowels and hangs him .
Lecter then heads back to the United States .
Verger bribes Justice Department official Paul Krendler to accuse Starling of withholding a note from Lecter , leading to her suspension .
Lecter lures Starling to Union Station .
Verger 's men , having trailed Starling , capture and bring Lecter to Verger .
Verger intends to feed Lecter alive to a herd of wild boars bred specifically for this purpose .
After her superiors refuse to act , Starling infiltrates Verger 's estate .
After neutralizing the two guards and freeing Lecter , she is shot by a third guard who was in hiding .
Lecter picks up an unconscious Starling just before the boars break through the doors .
Verger orders his physician Cordell Doemling to shoot Lecter , but , with Lecter 's suggestion , Cordell shoves his hated boss into the pen .
Lecter carries Starling and watches the boars eat Verger alive .
Lecter takes Starling to Krendler 's secluded lake house and treats her wounds .
When Krendler arrives for the Fourth of July , Lecter subdues and drugs him .
Starling , disoriented by morphine and dressed in a black velvet evening gown , awakens to find Krendler seated at the table set for an elegant dinner .
Weakened by the drugs , she looks on in horror as Lecter removes part of Krendler 's prefrontal cortex , sautés it , and feeds it to him .
After the meal , Starling tries to attack Lecter , but he overpowers her .
She handcuffs his wrist to hers .
Hearing the police closing in , Lecter threatens to sever her cuffed hand to escape .
Lecter is later seen on a flight with his own boxed lunch , his bandaged arm in a sling .
As he prepares to eat his meal , including what is assumed to be part of a cooked brain , a young boy seated next to him asks to try some of his food .
Lecter shares the brain with the boy , saying it is important " always to try new things . "

Section::::Background .
In 1994 , a Rolling Stone magazine interviewer asked The Silence of the Lambs director Jonathan Demme about a possible sequel .
Demme responded that Thomas Harris , author of The Silence of the Lambs , had been working on the follow - up for " seven or eight years " .
Demme had an idea even at that time that it would not be a straight follow - up .
Harris had told Demme : " I imagine Doctor Lecter going somewhere in Europe ... strolling round the streets of Florence or Munich , gazing in the windows of watchmakers ... "
Demme stated his intention to be involved in the film adaptation of Hannibal in 1998 , less than a year before the novel was published .
Dino De Laurentiis produced Michael Mann 's film Manhunter in 1986 , based on Harris 's 1981 novel Red Dragon , featuring the first appearance of Hannibal Lecter , played by Brian Cox .
De Laurentiis did not like Mann 's film : " Manhunter was no good ...
it was not Red Dragon , " he said .
De Laurentiis and his wife Martha ( also his co - producer ) had no direct involvement in The Silence of the Lambs , a decision De Laurentiis came to regret .
They did , however , own the rights to the Lecter character and reportedly allowed Orion Pictures , which produced The Silence of the Lambs , to use the character of Lecter for free , not wishing to be " greedy " .
When The Silence of the Lambs became a commercial and critical success in 1991 , winning five Academy Awards , both Dino and Martha De Laurentiis found themselves sitting on a valuable asset and eager for a follow - up novel they could adapt .
After a lengthy wait , De Laurentiis finally received a call from Harris telling him he had finished the sequel to The Silence of the Lambs and De Laurentiis purchased the rights for a record $ 10 million .
In April 1999 , Los Angeles Times reported that the budget for an adaptation of Hannibal could cost as much as $ 100 million .
It speculated that both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins would receive $ 15 million each to reprise their roles and " $ 5 million to $ 19 million for director Jonathan Demme .
"
The newspaper further reported : although The Silence of the Lambs cost only $ 22 million , this would not deter the studio from going ahead with Hannibal .
Mort Janklow , Harris 's agent at the time , told Los Angeles Times that Foster , Hopkins , and Demme would soon receive manuscripts of the novel , claiming it would make an unbelievable film .
The novel sold out of its initial 1.6 million print run in the summer of 1999 .
Hannibal went on to sell millions of copies following its release .
Demme informed the producers of Hannibal that he would pass on directing the film .
It has been claimed Demme turned down the project because he found the material " lurid " and was averse to the novel 's " gore " .
De Laurentiis said of Demme 's decision to decline : " When the pope dies , we create a new pope .
Good luck to Jonathan Demme .
Good - bye .
" He has since added that Demme felt he could not make a sequel as good as The Silence of the Lambs .
RIDLEY SCOTT Section::::Ridley Scott .
De Laurentiis visited Ridley Scott on the set of Gladiator and suggested to Ridley he read the novel he had bought the rights to .
Scott was in the third week before principal photography was due to finish on Gladiator .
Gladiator became a commercial and critical success , earning 12 Academy Award nominations .
De Laurentiis asked Scott if he would like to direct the film version of Hannibal .
Scott misunderstood which Hannibal he meant , thinking De Laurentiis was speaking of the general and historical figure from Carthage who nearly brought down the Roman Empire back around 200 B.C. , so he replied : " Basically , Dino , I 'm doing a Roman epic right now .
I do n't wanna do elephants coming over the Alps next , old boy . "
Scott read the manuscript in four sittings within a week , believing it to be a " symphony " , and expressed his desire to do it .
Scott further explains how he got involved : " I was shooting Gladiator in Malta and one day , for the hell of it , I went for a walk for half a mile down the road to the Malta Film Studio to see my old buddy Dino .
I had not seen him since I 'd worked on a version of Dune .
This was pre - Blade Runner .
Dino had pursued me to direct Dune and another film .
He 's always enthusiastic and aggressive and came after me when I did both Blade Runner and Alien , but I could n't do the films .
Anyway , we had an espresso together and a few days later , he called me to ask if he could visit the Gladiator set .
He arrived with a manuscript of Hannibal , about a month before it was published in book form .
He said : ' Let 's make this one . '
I have n't read anything so fast since The Godfather .
It was so rich in all kind of ways . "
Although Scott had accepted the job Demme had rejected , he said : " My first question was : ' What about Jonathan ? '
and they said : ' The original team said it 's too violent . '
I said , ' Okay .
I 'll do it . '
" Scott did , himself , have some uncertainty with the source material .
In particular , he had difficulties with the ending of the novel , in which Lecter and Starling become lovers :
" I could n't take that quantum leap emotionally on behalf of Starling .
Certainly , on behalf of Hannibal — I'm sure that 's been in the back of his mind for a number of years .
But for Starling , no .
I think one of the attractions about Starling to Hannibal is what a straight arrow she is . "
He also " did n't buy the book from the opera scene onwards , which became like a vampire movie . "
He asked Harris if he was " married to his ending " .
Harris said he was not , so Scott changed it .
SCRIPT DEVELOPMENT Section::::Script development .
Ted Tally , the screenwriter for The Silence of the Lambs , was another key member of the original team to decline involvement in Hannibal ( he won an Academy Award for his Silence adaptation ) .
Tally , like Demme , had problems with the novel 's " excesses " .
Steven Zaillian ( writer of Schindler 's List ) was offered the chance to write the adaptation after Tally passed , but he also declined .
He explained that " I was busy .
And I was n't sure I was interested .
You can almost never win when you do a sequel . "
David Mamet was the first screenwriter to produce a draft , which , according to Ridley Scott and the producers , needed major revisions .
Stacey Snider , co - chairman of Universal Pictures ( a co - production deal was struck between Universal and MGM ) said on the rejection of Mamet 's screenplay : " There 's no way David was going to read 15 pages of our notes and then be available to work on the script day - to - day . "
Mamet was preparing to direct his own film .
Zaillian , who had already passed , reconsidered and became involved in the project , saying : " It 's hard to say no to Dino once and it 's almost impossible to say no to him twice . "
A script review at ScreenwritersUtopia.com describes the Mamet draft as " stunningly bad " but found Zaillian 's rewrite to be " gripping entertainment " .
This question ( regarding the script development ) was put to Ridley Scott by Total Film magazine : "
There were lots of rewrites on Hannibal — what was the main problem with the original material ? "
Scott replied : " That 's inaccurate , because there were very few rewrites once I brought in Steve Zaillian .
If you were to ask who were the best three screenwriters in the business , Steve Zaillian would be one of them .
We discussed Hannibal endlessly . "
Asked if he had read Mamet 's draft , he said : " Yes .
He is very fast , very efficient , but he was off doing a film . '
Hannibal ' was green lit and his first draft only took about a month .
But I was scared that he would not be able to give me enough attention , because that draft needed a lot of work .
So I moved on basically .
" Scott has said there were writing and " structural problems " as to what they would do with parts of the film .
One of Zaillian 's key objectives was to revise the script by David Mamet until it pleased all parties , meaning the " love " story would need to be done by suggestion instead of by " assault " .
Scott worked through the script with Zaillian for 28 days making him " sweat through it with him and discuss every inch of the way with him . "
After 25 days Scott suddenly realized that Zaillian was " exorcising the 600 pages of the book .
He was distilling through discussion what he was gon na finally do ...
Frankly I could have just made it . "
CASTING
Section::::Casting .
It was unclear if Jodie Foster ( Clarice Starling ) and Anthony Hopkins ( Hannibal Lecter ) would reprise their respective roles for which they won Academy Awards in The Silence of the Lambs ( best actress / actor ) .
It became apparent that the producers and the studio could do without one of the original " stars " and would go on to find a replacement .
The withdrawal of both Foster and Hopkins could possibly have been terminal for the project , however .
De Laurentiis confirmed this after the film 's release : " First and foremost , I knew we had no movie without Anthony Hopkins . "
INVOLVEMENT OF JODIE FOSTER Section::::Involvement of Jodie Foster .
Regarding her involvement in a sequel to The Silence of the Lambs , Foster confirmed to Larry King in 1997 that she " would definitely be part of it . "
She told Entertainment Weekly magazine in 1997 that " Anthony Hopkins always talks about it .
I mean , everybody wants to do it .
Every time I see him , it 's like : ' When is it going to happen ?
When is it going to happen ? '
"
De Laurentiis thought Foster would decline once she read the book , even believing the final film was better for it .
Hopkins also had doubts Foster would be involved , saying he had a " hunch " she would not be .
Foster did turn it down , confirming this in late December 1999 .
This would cause problems for the studio , Universal and partner MGM .
"
The studio is just back from the holiday and is regrouping based on the news , and has no cohesive game plan at the moment , " said Kevin Misher , Universal 's President of Production .
Misher added that , " It was one of those moments when you sit down and think , ' Can Clarice be looked upon as James Bond for instance ?
A character who is replaceable ? '
Or was Jodie Foster Clarice Starling , and the audience will not accept anyone else ?
"
Foster said in December 1999 that the characterization of Starling in Hannibal had " negative attributes " and " betrayed " the original character .
Foster 's spokeswoman said the actress declined because Claire Danes had become available for Foster 's own project , Flora Plum .
Salary demands may also have played a part in Foster 's non - participation .
De Laurentiis said , " I call the agent of Judy [ sic ] Foster .
He say to me ' I have instruction .
She no want to read the script if you no give her an offer of $ 20 m and 15 % of the gross . '
And I say , ' Give my love to Judy [ sic ]
Foster , goodbye . '
" Entertainment Weekly described the project as becoming " a bloody mess , hemorrhaging talent and money " despite Hopkins being on - board .
Foster talked about Hannibal in an interview with Total Film in late 2005 .
She said : " The official reason I did n't do Hannibal is I was doing another movie , Flora Plum .
So I get to say , in a nice dignified way , that I was n't available when that movie was being shot ...
Clarice meant so much to Jonathan and I , she really did , and I know it sounds kind of strange to say
but there was no way that either of us could really trample on her . "
JULIANNE MOORE
AS
CLARICE STARLING Section::::Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling .
When it became clear that Foster would skip Hannibal , the production team considered several different actresses , including Cate Blanchett , Angelina Jolie , Gillian Anderson , Hilary Swank , Ashley Judd , Helen Hunt and Julianne Moore .
Hopkins asked his agent if he had any " power " over casting .
He informed De Laurentiis that he knew Moore , with whom he had worked on Surviving Picasso , and thought her a " terrific actress " .
Although Hopkins ' agent told him he had no contractual influence on casting , Scott thought it correct to discuss who would be Hopkins ' " leading lady " .
Scott said he was " really surprised to find that [ he ] had five of the top actresses in Hollywood wanting it .
" Moore would eventually secure the part .
Scott said his decision was swayed in favor of Moore because : " She is a true chameleon .
She can be a lunatic in Magnolia , a vamp in An Ideal Husband , a porn star in Boogie Nights and a romantic in The End of the Affair . "
" Julianne Moore , once Jodie decided to pass , was always top of my list , " said Scott on his female lead .
Moore talked about stepping into a role made famous by another actress : " The new Clarice would be very different .
Of course people are going to compare my interpretation with that of Jodie Foster 's ...
but this film is going to be very different . "
ANTHONY HOPKINS
AS HANNIBAL LECTER Section::::Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter .
Hopkins was generally expected to reprise his Academy Award - winning role .
Hopkins did say in June 1999 that he would only be interested if the script was " really good " .
Hopkins says on the making - of feature on DVD that he could n't make up his mind to commit .
" I was kind of surprised by this book , Hannibal .
I thought it was really overreaching and so bizarre .
So I could n't make up my mind about it all .
Some of it
I found intriguing , some
I was a little doubtful about .
" When the producers confirmed that they were going to film Harris ' novel , Hopkins told them yes , but added : " It needs some condensing . "
The Hollywood Reporter would confirm that Hopkins had agreed to reprise his role in late December 1999 , saying he had approved the latest draft of the script by Steven Zaillian .
Hopkins said he had no difficulty moving back into " Lecter 's mind " .
" I just learned the lines and showed up and walked around as Hannibal Lecter .
I thought , ' Do I repeat that same performance , or do I vary it ? '
Ten years had passed
so I changed a bit .
" In the book , Lecter uses bandages to disguise himself as a plastic surgery patient .
This was left out of the film because Scott and Hopkins agreed to leave the face alone .
Hopkins explains why : " It 's as if he 's making a statement—'catch me if you can ' .
With his big hat , he 's so obvious that nobody thinks he 's Hannibal Lecter .
I 've always thought he 's a very elegant man , a Renaissance man .
" In the film , Lecter is first seen in Florence " as the classical Lecter , lecturing and being smooth " , according to Hopkins .
When the film moves to the U.S. , Hopkins changed his appearance by building up muscle and cropping his hair short " to make him like a mercenary , that he would be so fit and so strong that he could just snap somebody in two if they got ...
in his way " .
GARY OLDMAN
AS MASON VERGER Section::::Gary Oldman as Mason Verger .
The part of Mason Verger , one of Lecter 's two surviving victims , was originally offered to Christopher Reeve based on his work as a wheelchair - bound police officer in Above Suspicion ( 1995 ) .
Not having read the novel , Reeve showed initial interest in the role , but ultimately declined upon realizing that Verger was a quadriplegic , facially - disfigured child rapist .
The part was later accepted by secondary choice Gary Oldman .
Co - producer Martha De Laurentiis claimed they had a " funny situation " with Oldman wanting a prominent " credit " .
She said : " Now how can you have a prominent credit with Hannibal ?
The characters are Hannibal and Clarice Starling .
So we really could n't work something out ( at first ) .
" Oldman was apparently " out " of the film for a while , but then came back in , asking to go " unbilled " .
Oldman would become transformed and " unrecognizable as himself " to play the part of Verger .
He would have no lips , cheeks or eyelids .
Make - up artist Greg Cannom said : " It 's really disgusting ...
I 've been showing people pictures [ of Oldman as Verger ] , and they all just say ' Oh my God , ' and walk away , which makes me very happy . "
Oldman said that having his name completely removed from the billing and credits allowed him to " do it anonymously " under the heavy make - up .
In home - release versions of the film , Oldman 's name is included in the closing credits .
FURTHER CASTING Section::::Further casting .
Other stars subsequently cast included Ray Liotta as U.S. Justice Department official Paul Krendler ( the character had appeared in The Silence of the Lambs , but original actor Ron Vawter had died in the interim ) and Italian actor Giancarlo Giannini as Detective Rinaldo Pazzi .
Francesca Neri played Pazzi 's wife , Allegra .
Frankie Faison reprised his role as orderly Barney Matthews .
KEY PRODUCTION CREW Section::::Key production crew .
Scott recruited key production crew whom he had worked with previously .
Production designer Norris Spencer had worked on Thelma & Louise , Black Rain and .
Cinematographer John Mathieson , editor Pietro Scalia and composer Hans Zimmer had all worked on Scott 's previous film Gladiator .
PRODUCTION AND POST - PRODUCTION BACKGROUND Section::::Production and post - production . Section::::Background .
Hannibal was filmed in 83 working days over 16 weeks .
The film began production on 8 May 2000 in Florence .
The film visited key locations in Florence and various locations around the United States .
Martha De Laurentiis said the film has almost a hundred locations and that it was a " constant pain of moving and dressing sets .
But the locations were beautiful .
Who could complain about being allowed to shoot in Palazzo Vecchio in Florence ?
Or President James Madison 's farm in Montpelier or the amazing Biltmore Estate in Asheville ?
" Eighty million dollars and a year and a half in production were spent before Scott got his first look at Hannibal in the editing room .
FILMING LOCATIONS
*
The whole second act of Hannibal takes place in Florence .
Ridley Scott had never filmed there before , but described it as " quite an experience ...
It was kind of organized chaos ...
We were there at the height of tourist season . "
Within Florence , the production would visit various locations such as the Palazzo Capponi ( as Dr. Fell 's workplace ) , the Ponte Vecchio , the Palazzo Vecchio , the Pharmacy of Santa Maria Novella and the Cathedral .
*
After leaving Italy on 5 June 2000 , the production moved to Washington ,
D.C. Filming took place over six days at Union Station .
The unusual sight of a carousel would appear in the transportation hub and shopping plaza at Ridley Scott 's request .
* Filming would last for seven weeks in Richmond , Virginia for the shootout in a crowded fish market ( shot at Richmond Farmer 's Market ) early in the film .
Julianne Moore underwent Federal Bureau of Investigation training at the Bureau 's headquarters before filming .
* A barn in Orange , Virginia , situated on the estate of President James Madison , was used to house 15 " performing hogs " .
The 15 Russian boars used in the shoot were from a selection of around 6,000 that the animal wranglers observed .
* Biltmore Estate in Asheville , North Carolina , the biggest privately owned estate in the U.S. , was chosen to signify the huge personal wealth of Mason Verger .
SPECIAL MAKE - UP EFFECTS
Section::::Special make - up effects .
Make - up artist Greg Cannom was pleased to be involved in Hannibal as it offered him the chance to produce " incredible and original make - ups " .
For Mason Verger , the make - up team would initially produce 20 different heads which looked like zombies and did not reflect the vision Scott had of the character ; Scott wanted Verger to look real with hideous scarring , and not something from the " House of Wax " .
Scott himself would actually call up the help of expert doctors in an effort to get the look of the character as realistic as possible .
Scott showed the make - up team pictures of foetal things , which he thought touching ; he wanted to make Mason Verger more touching than monstrous , as he thought of Verger as being someone who had n't lost his sense of humour ...
almost sympathetic .
Oldman would spend six hours a day in make - up to prepare for the role .
For one of the film 's final and infamous scenes , an exact duplicate was created of the character Paul Krendler , played by Ray Liotta , a scene which blended make - up , puppet work and CGI in a way which Scott called " seamless " .
TITLE SEQUENCE
Section::::Title sequence .
The main titles were designed by Nick Livesey , a graduate of the Royal College of Art who worked for one of Scott 's production companies in London .
The sequence , shot in Florence by Livesey himself was intended as the film 's second promotional trailer .
The studio thought it not " quite right " , but it remained on Scott 's mind and would eventually end up as the main title sequence .
Livesey would gather footage of pigeons in an empty square in Florence early one morning which , in the final cut , would morph into the face of Hannibal Lecter .
Scott believed it a good idea , as it fundamentally asked the question : ' Where is Hannibal Lecter ? '
Scott explains : " And of course this story tells it , with pigeons in the cobblestones of somewhere , where you wonder where that is ... and there he is ...
his face appears .
" The titles are said to have been influenced by the film Seven .
MUSIC Section::::Music .
Ridley Scott worked very closely with composer Hans Zimmer , during post - production on Hannibal .
Scott believes the music to a film is as important as dialogue—"It is the final adjustment to the screenplay , being able to also adjust the performance of the actors in fact .
" Zimmer and Scott sat in during the editing process with editor Pietro Scalia to discuss scenes in the film and " not music " .
Zimmer used a symphony orchestra for the opera sequence , but would mostly use what he described as a " very odd orchestra ...
only cellos and basses all playing at the extreme ends of their range .
" This was done to emphasise the character of Hannibal Lecter .
He explains : " Anthony 's character is for me somebody at the extreme range of whatever is humanly imaginable somehow . "
Zimmer also did not want the score to sound like a " modern day orchestra " .
The character Mason Verger had his own " theme " , which become more " perverted " as the film progressed , according to Zimmer .
Dante 's sonnet was put to music by Zimmer and Patrick Cassidy for the opera scene in Florence .
Tracksounds.com wrote positively of Zimmer 's score . "
Zimmer truly crafts a score worthy of most fans ' full attention ...
the classical elements , and yes , even the monologue combine to make this an intense listening experience . "
In a poll by British Classic FM listeners to find the greatest film soundtrack of all time , Hannibal ranked at 59 .
Strauss 's The Blue Danube is also played at several points in the film .
THEMES ROMANCE Section::::Themes .
Section::::Romance .
Scott has said he believes the underlying emotion of Hannibal is " affection " .
" In some instances , you might even wonder or certainly from one direction — is it more than affection ?
It is dark , because the story is of course essentially dark , but it 's kind of romantic at the same time . "
Scott openly admits to a " romantic thematic " running through the film .
He told CNN that : " Hannibal was quite a different target , essentially a study between two individuals .
Funny enough , it 's rather romantic and also quite humorous , but also there 's some quite bad behaviour as well .
" During the opera scene in Florence , Lecter attends an operatic adaptation of one of Dante 's sonnets , and meets with Detective Pazzi and his wife , Allegra .
She asks Lecter , " Do you believe a man could become so obsessed by a woman after a single encounter ? "
Lecter replies : " Yes , I believe he could ...
but would she see through the bars of his plight and ache for him ?
"
This scene , in the film , is one which Scott claims most people " missed " the meaning of .
It was in reference to Starling — to their encounter in The Silence of the Lambs .
The New York Times , in its review of the film , said Hannibal , " toys " with the idea of " love that dare not speak its name " .
Composer Hans Zimmer believes there to be " many " messages and subtext in each scene of the film .
He said , " I can score this movie truly as a Freudian archetypal beauty and the beast fairy tale , as a horror movie , as the most elegant piece , on corruption in the American police force , as the loneliest woman on earth , the beauty in renaissance ... " Zimmer ultimately believes it to be a dark love story , centering on two people who should never be together — a modern day Romeo and Juliet .
During the film 's post - production , Scott , Zimmer and the editor passionately argued about what a single shot meant , where a tear slides down Starling 's cheek during a confrontation with Lecter .
They could not agree if it was a tear of " anguish " , " loneliness " or " disgust " .
Scott told the New York Post that , the affair of the heart between Lecter and Starling is " metaphorical " .
Rolling Stone magazine even said in their review , " Scott offers a sly parody of relationships — think ' When Hannibal met Sally ' . " RETRIBUTION AND PUNISHMENT Section::::Retribution and punishment .
Ridley Scott has said that he believes Lecter , in his own way , to be " pure"—one of the key motivating factors for the character is the search for " retribution and punishment " .
" There is something very moral about Lecter in this film , " said Scott in his audio commentary .
" The behaviour of Hannibal is never insane—[I ] did n't want to use that excuse .
Is he insane ?
No , I think he 's as sane as you or I. He just likes it .
" Scott did say , however , " In our normal terms , he 's truly evil . " Scott also brings up the notion of absolution in reference to Lecter towards the film 's end .
Verger has one overriding objective in life : to capture Lecter and subject him to a slow , painful death .
CORRUPTION Section::::Corruption .
Part of the story involves the character Rinaldo Pazzi ( Giancarlo Giannini ) , a Florentine policeman who learns " Dr. Fell " 's true identity and realizes that this knowledge could make him rich .
His escalating abandonment of morality allows him to countenance and facilitate the death of a gypsy pickpocket , egged on by the desire to have the best for his much younger wife .
There is a moment in the film when Pazzi becomes corrupted , despite being what Scott describes as " very thoughtful " .
Paul Krendler also succumbs to greed and corruption .
Starling does not , however , and perseveres to the end , even refusing to release Lecter when she believes he is about to cut off her hand in order to free himself .
DISTRIBUTION PROMOTION Section::::Distribution .
Section::::Promotion .
The first trailer appeared in theaters and was made available via the official website in early May 2000 , over nine months before the film 's release .
As the film had only just begun production , footage was used from The Silence of the Lambs .
A second trailer , which featured footage from the new film , was released in late November 2000 .
In marketing the film , Hopkins ' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter was chosen as the unique selling point of Hannibal . "
Mr Hopkins is the draw here " , said Elvis Mitchell in a 2001
The New York Times article .
A poster released in the UK to promote Hannibal , featuring Lecter with a " skin mask " covering the right side of his face , was quickly removed from circulation as it was deemed " too shocking and disturbing for the public . "
Upon its release , Hannibal was met with significant media attention , with the film 's stars and director making several appearances on television , in newspapers and in magazines .
In an article for CBS News , Jill Serjeant stated that " the long - awaited sequel to the grisly 1991 thriller Silence of the Lambs is cooking up the hottest Internet and media buzz since the 1999 . "
Stars Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore made the covers of a number of magazines , including Vanity Fair , Entertainment Weekly , Premiere and Empire .

CRITICAL RESPONSE
Section::::Critical response .
The reviews for Hannibal were mixed .
Time magazine wrote : " A banquet of creepy , gory or grotesque incidents is on display in Hannibal .
But this superior sequel has romance in its dark heart .
"
Empire magazine gave it two out of five stars , calling it " laughable to just plain boring , Hannibal is toothless to the end . "
David Thomson , writing in the British Film Institute magazine Sight & Sound , praised the film .
" It works .
It 's smart , good - looking , sexy , fun
... dirty , naughty and knowing .
" Thomson does make clear , however , he is a great fan of director Ridley Scott 's work .
He adds : " It is , literally , that Hannibal Lecter has become such a household joke that he ca n't be dreadful again .
It seems clear that Anthony Hopkins and Scott saw that , and planned accordingly .
That 's how the movie was saved . "
Variety magazine in its review said " Hannibal is not as good as Lambs ... ultimately more shallow and crass at its heart than its predecessor , Hannibal is nevertheless tantalizing , engrossing and occasionally startling . "
A negative review in The Guardian claimed that what was wrong with the film was carried over from the book : " The result is an inflated , good - looking bore of a movie .
The Silence of the Lambs was a marvelous thing .
This , by contrast is barely okey - dokey . "
Roger Ebert gave the film a " Thumbs down " rating on the television program At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper and gave the film a 2.5 out of 4 stars rating in his print review , which he began with the following : " Ridley Scott 's Hannibal is a carnival geek show .
We must give it credit for the courage of its depravity ; if it proves nothing else , it proves that if a man cutting off his face and feeding it to his dogs does n't get the NC-17 rating for violence , nothing ever will .
" Hannibal has an overall Metacritic rating of 57 out of 100 from 36 reviews and a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 39 % , with an average rating of 5.1/10 from 168 reviews .
The latter 's website 's critical consensus reads , " While superbly acted and stylishly filmed , Hannibal lacks the character interaction between the two leads which made the first movie so engrossing . "
DIFFERENCES FROM THE NOVEL
Section::::Differences from the novel .
According to Variety magazine , the script for Hannibal was : " quite faithful to the Harris blueprint ; fans of the tome may regret the perhaps necessary excision of some characters , most notably Mason Verger 's muscle - bound macho sister Margot , as well as the considerable fascinating academic detail , but will basically feel the book has been respected ( yes , even the climactic dinner party is served up almost intact , with the only surprise twists saved for its wake ) .
"
Time Out noted : " The weight - watchers script sensibly dispenses with several characters to serve a brew that 's enjoyably spicy but low on substance .
So much story is squeezed into 131 minutes that little time 's left for analysis or characterization . "
Producer Dino De Laurentiis was asked why some characters , notably Jack Crawford , were left out of the film : " I think if you get a book which is 600 pages , you have to reduce it to a script of 100 pages .
In two hours of film , you can not possibly include all the characters .
We set ourselves a limit , and cut characters which were n't so vital . "
In the book , Mason Verger runs an orphanage , from which he calls children to verbally abuse as a substitute for his no longer being able to molest them .
He also has a sister , Margot , whom he had raped when they were children and who is a lesbian .
When she disclosed her sexual orientation to her family , their father disowned her .
As she is sterile due to steroid abuse , Verger exerts some control over her by promising her a semen sample with which to impregnate her lover , who could then inherit the Verger fortune .
At the book 's end , Margot and Starling both help Lecter escape during a shootout between Starling and Verger 's guards .
Margot , at Lecter 's advice , stimulates her brother to ejaculate with a rectally inserted cattle prod , and then kills him by ramming his pet moray eel down his throat .
The book 's controversial ending has Lecter presenting Starling with the exhumed bones of her father , which he " brings to life " by hypnotizing Starling , allowing her to say goodbye .
This forges an odd alliance between Starling and Lecter , culminating in their becoming lovers and escaping to Argentina .
At the novel 's end , Barney sees them at the Teatro Colón of Buenos Aires .
Also gone from the film are the flashbacks to Lecter 's childhood , in which he sees his younger sister , Mischa , eaten by German deserters in 1944 .
These flashbacks formed the basis for the 2007 film Hannibal Rising ( written concurrently with the 2006 novel of the same name ) which portrays Lecter as a young man .
Hopkins was asked in an interview on the subject of whether or not he believed the idea of Starling and Lecter heading off into the sunset as lovers ( as happens in the book ) .
" Yes , I did .
Other people found that preposterous .
I suppose there 's a moral issue there .
I think it would have been a very interesting thing though .
I think it would have been very interesting
had she gone off , because I suspected that there was that romance , attachment there , that obsession with her .
I guessed that a long time ago , at the last phone call to Clarice , at the end of SotL , she said , ' Dr. Lecter , Dr. Lecter ... ' . " POPULAR CULTURE Section::::Popular Culture .
In 2013 , there was a news story from Italy where a gangster fed his rival alive to pigs .
Many media stories compared this to a similar scene in Hannibal .
