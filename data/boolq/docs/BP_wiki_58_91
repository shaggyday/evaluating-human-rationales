CANON EF - S LENS MOUNT
The Canon EF - S lens mount is a derivative of the EF lens mount created for a subset of Canon digital single - lens reflex cameras with APS - C sized image sensors .
It was released in 2003 .
Cameras with the EF - S mount are backward compatible with the EF lenses and , as such , have a flange focal distance of 44.0 mm .
Such cameras , however , have more clearance , allowing lens elements to be closer to the sensor than in the EF mount .
Only Canon cameras released after 2003 with APS - C sized sensors support the EF - S mount .
The " S " in EF - S has variously been described by Canon as coming from either " Small image circle "
( the lens projects a smaller image circle than normal EF lenses to match the sensor ) , or " Short back focus " (
the smaller mirror used in APS - C cameras also allows optical elements to protrude further into the camera body , reducing the minimum distance between the sensor and the back element of the lens ) .
The combination of a smaller sensor and shorter back - focus distance enhances the possibilities for wide angle and very wide angle lenses , and enables all lenses designed for the EF - S mount to be made smaller , lighter ( containing less glass ) , faster ( larger aperture ) and less expensive .
Although not all Canon EF - S lenses use this short back focus , they can not be mounted on DSLRs with sensors larger than APS - C.
However , some lenses produced by third - party manufacturers may feature the standard EF mount if they do not require the shorter back focus but only have a small image circle .
Such lenses will give noticeable vignetting if used on a 35 mm film or full frame sensor cameras .
To a lesser degree , vignetting also occurs with APS - H sensor sizes , such as several ( now discontinued ) cameras of the 1D series .

By design , it is physically impossible to mount EF - S lenses on EF - only cameras .
This is because the increased proximity of the lens to the sensor means that on full - frame sensor or 35 mm film EF cameras the lens itself would obstruct the mirror 's movement and cause damage to the lens and/or camera .
While it is possible to modify the lens such that the physical obstruction is removed , allowing for mounting to EF mount cameras , the rear of the lens would still obstruct the mirror .
An additional reason is that the lenses produce a smaller image circle of even illumination ( circle of no vignetting ) .
An EF - S lens alignment mark is indicated by a small white rectangle , whereas the EF employs a small red dot .
The lens will insert into the body when the alignment marks on each are matched , and the lens can then be rotated and locked into the operating position .
EF - S camera bodies have both EF - S and EF alignment marks , while EF bodies have only EF marks .
Some have reported success attaching EF - S lenses to full - frame bodies with the use of an extension tube ; however , this does not eliminate the vignetting problem , and also removes the lens 's ability to achieve infinity focus .
Also , attachment of EF - S lenses on EF bodies can often be accomplished by removing the small plastic ring seen in the photo above .
Although vignetting is still an issue , photos can be taken , and infinity focus achieved .
This modification comes with caveats , one being that on some lenses , like the EF - S 10 - 22 mm , at the 10 mm setting , the element protrudes too far back toward EF mount camera bodies .
The 10D , D60 , and earlier cameras share the EF - only mount with the full frame EOS camera bodies , and also with the APS - H size EOS camera bodies ( 1D series prior to the 1D X ) , despite having a smaller sensor and therefore a smaller mirror .
LIST OF EF - S LENSES Section::::List of EF - S lenses .
The EF - S lens mount is a relatively new offering from Canon , so the selection of available lenses is limited compared to the full EF range , but it is backward compatible with the EF mount , and can therefore still accept all EF lenses .
The variety of EF - S prime lenses is very limited in comparison to EF - S zoom lenses , with three primes to nine zooms .
EF - S lenses are very popular due to their lower cost and zoom lenses are preferred by amateur photographers .
, no EF - S lens has been produced with the " L " designation or with diffractive optics , and only three EF - S prime lenses have been produced . !
