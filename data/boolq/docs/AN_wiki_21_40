HISTORY Section::::History .
Lenni Lenape people , also known as " Delaware Indians " , were the original inhabitants of the Reading area .
The Colony of Pennsylvania was a 1680 land grant from King Charles II of England to William Penn .
Comprising more than 45,000 square miles ( 120,000 km2 ) , it was named for his father , Sir William Penn .
In 1743 , Richard and Thomas Penn ( sons of William Penn ) mapped out the town of Reading with Conrad Weiser .
Taking its name from Reading , Berkshire , England , the town was established in 1748 .
Upon the creation of Berks County in 1752 , Reading became the county seat .
The region was settled by emigrants from southern and western Germany , who bought land from the Penns .
The first Amish community in the New World was established in Greater Reading , Berks County .
The Pennsylvanian German dialect was spoken in the area well into the 1950s and later .
During the French and Indian War , Reading was a military base for a chain of forts along the Blue Mountain .
By the time of the American Revolution , the area 's iron industry had a total production exceeding England 's .
That output helped supply George Washington 's troops with cannons , rifles , and ammunition in the Revolutionary War .
During the early period of the conflict , Reading was again a depot for military supply .
Hessian prisoners from the Battle of Trenton were also detained here .
Philadelphia , Pennsylvania was the capital of the United States at the time of the Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793 .
President Washington traveled to Reading , and considered making it the emergency national capital , but chose Germantown instead .
Susanna Cox was tried and convicted for infanticide in Reading in 1809 .
Her case attracted tremendous sympathy ; 20,000 viewers came to view her hanging , swamping the 3,000 inhabitants .
Census data showed that , from 1810 to 1950 , Reading was among the nation 's top one hundred largest urban places .
The Schuylkill Canal , a north - south canal completed in 1825 , paralleled the Schuylkill River and connected Reading with Philadelphia and the Delaware River .
The Union Canal , an east - west canal completed in 1828 , connected the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Rivers , and ran from Reading to Middletown , Pennsylvania , a few miles south of Harrisburg , Pennsylvania .
Railroads forced the abandonment of the canals by the 1880s .
The Philadelphia and Reading Railroad ( P&R ) was incorporated in 1833 .
During the Long Depression following the Panic of 1873 , a statewide railroad strike in 1877 over delayed wages led to a violent protest and clash with the National Guard in which six Reading men were killed .
Following more than a century of prosperity , the Reading Company was forced to file for bankruptcy protection in 1971 .
The bankruptcy was a result of dwindling coal shipping revenues and strict government regulations that denied railroads the ability to set competitive prices , required high taxes , and forced the railroads to continue to operate money - losing passenger service lines .
On April 1 , 1976 , the Reading Company sold its current railroad interests to the newly formed Consolidated Railroad Corporation ( Conrail ) .
The Charles Evans Cemetery is the non - sectarian cemetery where many of the city 's prominent business and community leaders have been buried since the cemetery 's opening in the 1840s .
Established through the donation of land by Reading attorney and philanthropist Charles Evans and a subsequent financial endowment upon his death in 1847 , which provided for future improvements to the grounds , the cemetery became a primary gathering point for annual Memorial Day activities from the late 19th through the late 20th centuries due to the presence of the Grand Army of the Republic monument , which was dedicated there in 1887 .
Early in the 20th century , the city participated in the burgeoning automobile and motorcycle industry as home to the pioneer " Brass Era " companies , Daniels Motor Company , Duryea Motor Wagon Company and Reading - Standard Company .
Reading experienced continuous growth until the 1930s , when its population reached nearly 120,000 .
From the 1940s to the 1970s , however , the city saw a sharp downturn in prosperity , largely owing to the decline of the heavy industry and railroads , on which Reading had been built , and a national trend of urban decline .
In 1972 , Hurricane Agnes caused extensive flooding in the city , not the last time the lower precincts of Reading were inundated by the Schuylkill River .
A similar , though not as devastating , flood occurred during June 2006 .
The 2000 census showed that Reading 's population decline had ceased .
This was attributed to an influx of Hispanic residents from New York City , as well as from the extension of suburban sprawl from Philadelphia 's northwest suburbs .
Reading has its share of obstacles to overcome , namely crime .
However , new crime fighting strategies appear to have had an impact .
In 2006 , the city dropped in the rankings of dangerous cities , and again in 2007 .
In December 2007 , NBC 's Today show featured Reading as one of the top four " Up and Coming Neighborhoods " in the United States as showing potential for a real estate boom .
The interviewee , Barbara Corcoran , chose the city by looking for areas of big change , renovations , cleanups of parks , waterfronts , and warehouses .
