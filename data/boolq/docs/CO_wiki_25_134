DUPLEX ( BUILDING )
A duplex house plan has two living units attached to each other , either next to each other via townhouses or above each other like apartments By contrast , a building comprising two attached units on two distinct properties is typically considered semi - detached or twin homes but is also called a duplex in parts of the Northeastern United States .
The term " duplex " is not extended to three - unit and four - unit buildings , as they would be referred to with specific terms such as triplex and fourplex or quadplex / quadruplex .
Because of the flexibility of the term , the line between an apartment building and a duplex is somewhat blurred , with apartment buildings tending to be bigger , while duplexes are usually the size of a normal house .
British English usage refers simply to the number of levels within an apartment unit with duplex indicating two storeys ( traditionally this was referred to as a maisonette ) and triplex for three .
A semi - detached house would never be referred to as duplex in the United Kingdom .
The word " duplex " is occasionally mispronounced with the last letter silent due to multiple misperceptions : ( 1 ) that the English word came from French , ( 2 )
that an English word naturalized from French needs to retain the French pronunciation , and ( 3 ) that the terminal -x would be silent in French .
But ( 1 ) this English word came straight from educated English speakers ' use of Latin ( not by way of French ) , ( 2 ) most English words that came from French words use naturalized pronunciation , and ( 3 ) the French pronunciation of the French cognate ends in /É›ks/ anyway .

Major Canadian cities sometimes use the term duplex to refer specifically to a building with one unit built above another .
Edmonton defines ' Duplex Housing ' as " development consisting of a building containing only two Dwellings , with one Dwelling placed over the other in whole or in part with individual and separate access to each Dwelling " .
Calgary defines Duplex Dwelling as " a building which contains two Dwelling Units , one located above the other , with each having a separate entrance " .
Toronto proposes in their new Zoning Bylaw to define ' Duplex Building ' as a building that has only two dwelling units , and one dwelling unit is entirely or partially on top of the other dwelling unit .
Halifax defines Duplex Dwelling as " the whole of a dwelling that is divided horizontally into two separate dwelling units , each of which has an independent entrance " .
Other major cities use the term duplex , but for dwelling units .
Dallas defines the term duplex as " two dwelling units located on a lot " .
Philadelphia defines a duplex dwelling as " a dwelling occupied as the home or residence of two ( 2 ) families , under one ( 1 ) roof , each family occupying a single unit " , a definition that excludes a pair of twin ( semi - detached ) houses , two dwellings separated by a firewall that extends above the roofline .
Other major cities do not use the term duplex in their zoning or land - use bylaws .
San Francisco and Vancouver use the term Two - family dwelling .
Winnipeg uses the term Dwelling , two - family .
The definitions of these terms do not specify the physical relationship between the two dwelling units in the building .
In cities such as Buffalo , Detroit and Chicago the term Two - flat is used and defines it as a " residential building that contains 2 dwelling units located on a single lot .
The dwelling units must share a common wall or common floor / ceiling . "
Where cities do not define the relationship of the dwelling units to one another , units may be built one on top of the other , or one beside the other .
The latter arrangement is more specifically referred to as a semi - detached building .
