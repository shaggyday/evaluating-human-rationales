Mark Weiss 's wedding by Jon Bon Jovi 's parents who suggested that he try out for their son 's friend 's ( Dave Sabo ) band .
At the time Bach was wary of joining another USA - based band after his negative experience in his previous band Madam X , but upon hearing Skid Row 's demo tapes , Bach flew to New Jersey to audition and the members asked him to join in early 1987 .
In 1991 , Bach was criticized for performing wearing a T - shirt reading " AIDS Kills Fags Dead " .
Later he claimed he wore it without reading it first ; it had been thrown to him by a fan .
Although he made light of the incident in his original apology ( stating that he also would 've been offended by someone mocking his grandmother 's then - recent death with a " Cancer Kills Grandmas Dead " shirt ) , Bach has since apologized for and disavowed the statement , " That was really stupid and wrong for me to wear that for one half - hour in my life .
What nobody brings up is in 2000 , when I was in Jekyll & Hyde , and at an auction for Broadway Cares , I donated $ 12,000 of my own money to fight AIDS . "
Following disagreements over musical material , Bach was fired from the band in 1996 .
However , rumors circulated that he had left the band due to his other band - mates believing they should not play as an opening act for KISS .
Band - mate Rachel Bolan also had a side project , a punk band Prunella Scales who were playing at the same time as the planned KISS show .
