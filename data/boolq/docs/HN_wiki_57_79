BAD LIP READING
Bad Lip Reading is a YouTube channel created and run by a man who humorously lip - reads onto real clips of politics , tv shows , films , and so on .
He deliberately does it badly for comedic effect , hence the name .
Rolling Stone described the channel as " the breakout hit " of the 2012 United States presidential cycle .
As of January 2018 , the Bad Lip Reading YouTube channel had amassed over 7 million subscribers and over a billion views across its videos .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The " Bad Lip Reader " behind the channel is an anonymous music and video producer based in Los Angeles ( originally from Texas . )
The first Bad Lip Reading video released was a spoof of Rebecca Black 's song " Friday " , entitled " Gang Fight " .
New music and lyrics were matched to Black 's video to make it appear as though she were singing about gang warfare .
The " Gang Fight " YouTube video , released in March 2011 , earned BLR a million hits and thousands of subscribers .
More spoof videos followed , including interpretations of The Black Eyed Peas ' " Boom Boom Pow " ( a viral video called " Everybody Poops " ) ; Taylor Swift 's " Our Song " ; and Michael Bublé 's " Have n't Met You Yet " .
The latter was transformed into the " electronica - inspired " " Russian Unicorn " , which Bublé himself praised as his " new favorite song " and " one of the coolest things I 've ever seen " .
In September 2011 , BLR branched out from pop singers to politicians with a " bad lip - reading " of Texas governor and US Presidential hopeful Rick Perry .
BLR replaced clips of Perry with invented dialogue matched to his lip movements .
After airing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show , the video was featured by news and media outlets across the United States , leading to a sudden surge in Bad Lip Reading 's popularity .
Following the Perry spoof , BLR released bad lip - readings of President Obama , Republican presidential candidates Michele Bachmann , Mitt Romney , Herman Cain , Ron Paul , Newt Gingrich , and Rick Santorum .
The channel found even more success in November 2012 when it began overdubbing popular movie and television shows .
BLR 's version of Twilight quickly went viral , followed by parodies of The Hunger Games ;
The Walking Dead ; and Game of Thrones .
The videos have been well - received not only by the public , but also by the cast and creators of the properties being spoofed .
In her online blog , Elizabeth Banks , Jennifer Lawrence 's co - star in The Hunger Games , said , " Bad Lip Reading is awesome .
I was introduced to it by none other than Jennifer Lawrence .
Yup — she saw this , people .
And she laughed .
And so did I. A lot .
"
Lawrence 's co - star Josh Hutcherson also praised the video , tweeting it to his fans .
The cast and creators of The Walking Dead have publicly praised the Bad Lip Reading " Walking Dead " videos on several occasions .
Expanding his scope yet again , in January 2013 BLR released a bad lip - reading of National Football League players , coaches , and referees , which would go on to become the channel 's most popular video .
A second NFL video followed in 2014 , and a third was released in 2015 .
The NFL Bad Lip Reading video would go on to become an annual event for the channel , with each video being released shortly before the Super Bowl each year .
In December of 2015 , Bad Lip Reading simultaneously released three new videos , one for each of the three films in the original Star Wars trilogy .
These videos found BLR using guest voices for the first time , featuring Jack Black as Darth Vader , Maya Rudolph as Princess Leia , and Bill Hader in multiple roles .
The Empire Strikes Back BLR video featured a scene of Yoda singing to Luke about an unfortunate encounter with a seagull on the beach .
BLR would later expand this scene into a full - length standalone song known as " Seagulls !
( Stop It Now ) " , which was released in November 2016 ( eventually hitting # 1 on the Billboard Comedy Digital Tracks chart . )
As of December 2018 , the " Seagulls ! "
video is Bad
Lip Reading 's most viewed YouTube upload , and most popular musical production .
In the song , Yoda sings to Luke Skywalker about the dangers posed by vicious seagulls if one dares to go to the beach .
Mark Hamill , who played Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars films , publicly praised " Seagulls ! "
( and Bad Lip Reading in general )
while speaking at Star Wars Celebration in 2017 : " I love them , and I showed Carrie [ Fisher ]
the Yoda one … we were dying .
I showed it to her in her trailer .
She loved it .
I retweeted it … and [ BLR ] contacted me and said ' Do you want to do Bad Lip Reading ? '
And I said , ' I 'd love to … ' " .
Hamill and Bad Lip Reading would go on to collaborate on Bad Lip Reading 's version of The Force Awakens , with Hamill providing the voice of Han Solo .
The Star Wars Trilogy Bad Lip Reading videos also spawned a second musical number titled " Bushes of Love " , which featured Ben Kenobi singing to Luke Skywalker about the perils of love .
The song would hit # 2 on the Billboard Comedy Digital Tracks chart .
Hamilton creator and star Lin - Manuel Miranda described the song as " THE summer jam of 2017 " .
In January 2017 , BLR released a Bad Lip Reading of Donald Trump 's inauguration , which quickly went viral , amassing over 36 million views in 2017 alone .
YouTube would rank the video at # 7 on its list of the Top Ten Trending Videos of 2017 .
In a Rolling Stone interview , the producer behind the Bad Lip Reading videos said that he first encountered the technique of lip reading when his mother , then in her 40s , lost her hearing due to unknown causes .
While she excelled at lip reading , he was unable to pick up the skill despite trying : " I was terrible at it . "
In 2013 , Bad Lip Reading won the Webby Awards ' People 's Voice Award for " Comedy : Long Form or Series " .
In April 2014 , BLR won the American Comedy Award for Best Viral Video for its " NFL :
A Bad Lip Reading " video .
Patrick Stewart accepted the award on BLR 's behalf during the televised ceremony on NBC .
On June 8 , 2014 the BLR Facebook page announced the release of the full version of " Modify " by Kniles , a song that has been used in multiple BLR productions .
The fact that this song was used without previous attribution , as well as stylistic similarities to other BLR - produced songs , have prompted speculation that Kniles is another pseudonym for the individual behind Bad Lip Reading .
A Bad Lip Reading of the Disney Channel original movie High School Musical premiered as a half - hour special on July 11 , 2016 on Disney XD .
COPYRIGHT DISPUTE
Section::::Copyright dispute .
One of Bad Lip Reading 's works , " Dirty Spaceman " , a redubbing of " Check It Out " by Will.i.am featuring Nicki Minaj , was taken down due to a claim of copyright infringement .
It is unclear if Universal Music issued a formal DMCA takedown request or if YouTube 's Content ID Match system detected the work and removed it automatically .
Also , in March 2012 , the video " Beard With Glue , " a bad lip reading of " You 're Beautiful " by James Blunt , was taken down by Warner Music Group on a copyright claim .
Unlike " Dirty Spaceman " , the claim was soon released , and the video was returned .
Likewise , " Gang Fight " was taken down in 2011 , but returned .
UMG has also taken down " Rockin ' All Nite Long " , the Taylor Swift spoof that also features Wiz Khalifa .
