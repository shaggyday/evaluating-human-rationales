LIFE , LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS " Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness " is a well - known phrase in the United States Declaration of Independence .
The phrase gives three examples of the " unalienable rights " which the Declaration says have been given to all humans by their creator .
ORIGIN AND PHRASING Section::::Origin and phrasing .
The United States Declaration of Independence was drafted by Thomas Jefferson , and then edited by the Committee of Five , which consisted of Jefferson , John Adams , Benjamin Franklin , Roger Sherman , and Robert Livingston .
It was then further edited and adopted by the Committee of the Whole of the Second Continental Congress on July 4 , 1776 .
The second paragraph of the first article in the Declaration of Independence contains the phrase " Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness " .
Jefferson 's " original Rough draught " is on exhibit in the Library of Congress .
This version was used by Julian Boyd to create a transcript of Jefferson 's draft , which reads : The Committee of Five edited Jefferson 's draft .
Their version survived further edits by the whole Congress intact , and reads :
A number of possible sources or inspirations for Jefferson 's use of the phrase in the Declaration of Independence have been identified , although scholars debate the extent to which any one of them actually influenced Jefferson .
Jefferson declared himself an Epicurean during his lifetime : this is a philosophical doctrine that teaches the pursuit of happiness , here meaning " prosperity , thriving , wellbeing " and proposes autarchy , which translates as self - rule , self - sufficiency or freedom .
The greatest disagreement comes between those who suggest the phrase was drawn from John Locke and those who identify some other source .
LOCKEAN ROOTS
HYPOTHESIS Section::::Lockean roots hypothesis .
In 1689 , Locke argued in his Two Treatises of Government that political society existed for the sake of protecting " property " , which he defined as a person 's " life , liberty , and estate " .
In A Letter Concerning Toleration , he wrote that the magistrate 's power was limited to preserving a person 's " civil interest " , which he described as " life , liberty , health , and indolency of body ; and the possession of outward things " .
He declared in his Essay Concerning Human Understanding that " the highest perfection of intellectual nature lies in a careful and constant pursuit of true and solid happiness " .
According to those scholars who saw the root of Jefferson 's thought in Locke 's doctrine , Jefferson replaced " estate " with " the pursuit of happiness " , although this does not mean that Jefferson meant the " pursuit of happiness " to refer primarily or exclusively to property .
Under such an assumption , the Declaration of Independence would declare that government existed primarily for the reasons Locke gave , and some have extended that line of thinking to support a conception of limited government .
VIRGINIA DECLARATION OF RIGHTS Section::::Virginia Declaration of Rights .
The first and second article of the Virginia Declaration of Rights , written by George Mason and adopted unanimously by the Virginia Convention of Delegates on June 12 , 1776 , speaks of happiness in the context of recognizably Lockean rights and is paradigmatic of the way in which " the fundamental natural rights of mankind " were expressed at the time .
Benjamin Franklin was in agreement with Thomas Jefferson in downplaying protection of " property " as a goal of government .
It is noted that Franklin found property to be a " creature of society " and thus , he believed that it should be taxed as a way to finance civil society .
ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES Section::::Alternative hypotheses .
In 1628 , Sir Edward Coke wrote in The First Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England , his commentary on Thomas de Littleton , that " It is commonly said that three things be favoured in Law , Life , Liberty , Dower . "
At common law , dower was closely guarded as a means by which the widow and orphan of a deceased landowner could keep their real property .
Garry Wills has argued that Jefferson did not take the phrase from Locke and that it was indeed meant to be a standard by which governments should be judged .
Wills suggests Adam Ferguson as a good guide to what Jefferson had in mind :
The 17th - century cleric and philosopher Richard Cumberland wrote that promoting the well - being of our fellow humans is essential to the " pursuit of our own happiness " .
Locke never associated natural rights with happiness , but his philosophical opponent Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz made such an association in the introduction to his Codex Iuris Gentium .
William Wollaston 's The Religion of Nature Delineated describes the " truest definition " of " natural religion " as being " The pursuit of happiness by the practice of reason and truth " .
An English translation of Jean - Jacques Burlamaqui 's Principles of Natural and Politic Law prepared in 1763 extolled the " noble pursuit " of " true and solid happiness " in the opening chapter discussing natural rights .
Historian Jack Rakove posits Burlamaqui as the inspiration for Jefferson 's phrase .
Another possible source for the phrase is in the Commentaries on the Laws of England published by Sir William Blackstone , from 1765 to 1769 , which are often cited in the laws of the United States .
Blackstone argues that God ' has so intimately connected , so inseparably interwoven the laws of eternal justice with the happiness of each individual , that the latter can not be attained but by observing the former ; and , if the former be punctually obeyed , it can not but induce the latter .
In consequence of which mutual connection of justice and human felicity , he has not perplexed the law of nature with a multitude of abstracted rules and precepts , referring merely to the fitness or unfitness of things , as some have vainly surmised ; but has graciously reduced the rule of obedience to this one paternal precept , " that man should pursue his own true and substantial happiness .
" This is the foundation of what we call ethics , or natural law . ' COMPARABLE MOTTOS WORLDWIDE Section::::Comparable mottos worldwide .
Other tripartite mottos include " liberté , égalité , fraternité " ( liberty , equality , fraternity ) in France ; " Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit " ( unity , justice and liberty ) in Germany and " peace , order , and good government " in Canada .
It is also similar to a line in the Canadian Charter of Rights : " life , liberty , security of the person " ( this line was also in the older Canadian Bill of rights , which added " enjoyment of property " to the list ) .
The phrase can also be found in Chapter III , Article 13 of the 1947 Constitution of Japan , and in President Ho Chi Minh 's 1945 declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam .
An alternative phrase " life , liberty , and property " , is found in the Declaration of Colonial Rights , a resolution of the First Continental Congress .
The Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution declare that governments can not deprive any person of " life , liberty , or property " without due process of law .
Also , Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reads , " Everyone has the right to life , liberty , and security of person " .
