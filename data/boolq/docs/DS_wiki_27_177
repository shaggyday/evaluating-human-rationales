In 1912 New Orleans , a girl named Tiana and her friend Charlotte La Bouff listen to Tiana 's mother read the story of The Frog Prince .
Charlotte finds the story to be romantic , while Tiana proclaims she will never kiss a frog .
Fourteen years later , Tiana has grown into an aspiring young chef who works as a waitress for two local diners , so she can save enough money to start her own restaurant , a dream she shared with her deceased father .
Prince Naveen of Maldonia arrives in New Orleans to better his financial situation .
After being cut off by his parents , Naveen intends to marry a rich southern belle , and Charlotte is the perfect candidate .
Eli " Big Daddy " La Bouff , a rich sugar baron and Charlotte 's father , is hosting a masquerade ball in Naveen 's honor .
Charlotte hires Tiana to make beignets for the ball , giving her enough money to buy an old sugar mill to convert into her restaurant .
Meanwhile , Naveen and his valet , Lawrence , meet the voodoo witch doctor Doctor Facilier .
Inviting them into his emporium , Facilier convinces them that he can make their dreams come true , but neither man gets what they are expecting ; Naveen is transformed into a frog , while Lawrence is given a voodoo talisman that makes him resemble Naveen , which Facilier intends to use to have Lawrence marry Charlotte , after which , he will kill La Bouff and claim his fortune .
At the ball , Tiana discovers she may lose the mill to a higher bidder .
Tiana then meets Naveen , who , believing her to be a princess because of her costume , asks her to kiss him and break Facilier 's spell .
In exchange for the money needed , Tiana accepts , but since she 's not an actual princess , when she kisses Naveen , she is turned into a frog herself .
A chase ensues , and Tiana and Naveen escape to a bayou .
In the bayou , Tiana and Naveen meet Louis , a trumpet - playing alligator , and Ray , a Cajun firefly .
Louis and Ray offer to lead Tiana and Naveen to the voodoo queen Mama Odie , whom they believe can undo the curse .
During the journey , Tiana and Naveen develop feelings for each other .
Meanwhile , Facilier makes a deal with the voodoo spirits , offering them the souls of the people of New Orleans ; in exchange , the spirits grant Facilier the services of a host of shadow demons , whom he orders to find and capture Naveen .
When the four find Mama Odie after escaping from hunters , she tells them that Naveen must kiss a true princess in order to break the spell .
They return to New Orleans to find Charlotte , who is the princess of the Mardi Gras Parade , but only until midnight .
Naveen tells Ray he loves Tiana and is willing to give up his dreams for her , but before he can tell Tiana , he is captured by the demons and brought to Facilier .
After Ray tells Tiana that Naveen loves her , Tiana goes to the parade to find a human " Naveen " marrying Charlotte ; but Ray rescues the real Naveen and steals the charm that disguises Lawrence .
Ray finds Tiana , gives her the charm and attempts to hold off the demons so she can escape , but Facilier manages to mortally wound him .
Facilier then offers to make Tiana 's restaurant dream come true in exchange for the talisman .
Realizing she would rather be with Naveen , and recognizing Facilier 's true intentions , Tiana destroys the talisman .
The angered voodoo spirits claim Facilier himself as payment for his debts to them and drag him into the spirit world , leaving a tombstone with Facilier 's name and horrified face on it .
As Lawrence is taken away by the police , Naveen explains everything to Charlotte , Tiana and Naveen reveal their love to each other .
Charlotte agrees to kiss Naveen so he and Tiana can be together as people .
The clock strikes midnight before she can do so , but the couple decide they are content to live together as frogs .
During a funeral for Ray a beam of light shines down and a new star appears next to Evangeline 's .

PRODUCTION
EARLY
DEVELOPMENT
Section::::Production .
Section::::Early development .
Disney had once announced that 2004 's Home on the Range would be their last traditionally animated film .
After the company 's acquisition of Pixar in 2006 , Ed Catmull and John Lasseter , the new president and chief creative officer of Disney Animation Studios , reversed this decision and reinstated hand - drawn animation at the studio .
Many animators who had either been laid off or had left the studio when the traditional animation units were dissolved in 2003 were located and re - hired for the project .
Lasseter also brought back directors Ron Clements and John Musker , whose earlier works include The Great Mouse Detective ( 1986 ) , The Little Mermaid ( 1989 ) , Aladdin ( 1992 ) , Hercules ( 1997 ) , and Treasure Planet ( 2002 ) .
The duo had left the company in 2005 , but Lasseter requested their return to Disney to direct and write the film and had let them choose the style of animation ( traditional or CGI )
they wanted to use .
The story for the film began development by merging two projects in development at Disney and Pixar at the time , both based around " The Frog Prince " fairy tale .
One of the projects was based on E. D. Baker 's The Frog Princess , in which the story 's heroine ( Princess Emma ) kisses a prince turned frog ( Prince Eadric ) , only to become a frog herself .
The Princess and the Frog returns to the musical film format used in many of the previously successful Disney animated films , with a style Musker and Clements declared , like with Aladdin and The Little Mermaid , had inspiration from Golden Age Disney features such as Cinderella .
Musker and Clements thought that given all fairy tales were set in Europe , they could do an American fairy tale .
They stated that they chose New Orleans as a tribute to the history of the city , for its " magical " qualities , and because it was Lasseter 's favorite city .
The directors spent ten days in Louisiana before starting to write the film .
The Princess and the Frog was originally announced as The Frog Princess in July 2006 , and early concepts and songs were presented to the public at The Walt Disney Company 's annual shareholders ' meeting in March 2007 .
These announcements drew criticism from African - American media outlets , due to elements of the Frog Princess story , characters , and settings considered distasteful .
African - American critics disapproved of the original name for the heroine , " Maddy " , due to its similarity to the derogatory term " mammy " .
Also protested were Maddy 's original career as a chambermaid , the choice to have the black heroine 's love interest be a non - black prince , which upset opponents of on - screen interracial romance , and the use of a black male voodoo witchdoctor as the film 's villain .
The Frog Princess title was also thought by critics to be a slur on French people .
Also questioned was the film 's setting of New Orleans , which had been heavily damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , resulting in the expulsion of a large number of mostly black residents .
Critics claimed the choice of New Orleans as the setting for a Disney film with a black heroine was an affront to the Katrina victims ' plight .
In response to these early criticisms , the film 's title was changed in May 2007 from The Frog Princess to The Princess and the Frog .
The name " Maddy " was changed to " Tiana " , and the character 's occupation was altered from chambermaid to waitress .
Talk show host Oprah Winfrey was hired as a technical consultant for the film , leading to her taking a voice - acting role in the film as Tiana 's mother , Eudora .
WRITING AND THEMES Section::::Writing and themes .
The head of story , Don Hall , described the plot as a fairy tale " twisted enough that it seems new and fresh " , with a kingdom that is a modern city , a handsome prince that is a " knuckleheaded playboy " and a variation on the fairy godmother with Mama Odie .
Co - writer Rob Edwards also said The Princess and the Frog was " a princess movie for people who do n't like princess movies " .
As the writers thought Tiana 's character motivation of simply dreaming of having her own restaurant was not appealing enough , they expanded so it was her father 's as well , with the extra philosophy of " food bringing people together from all walks of life " .
Musker and Clements stated that while Tiana already starts as a sympathetic character , the events of the plot make her " understand things in a deeper level " and change people around her .
Both protagonists would learn from each other ‚Äî Naveen to take responsibilities , Tiana to enjoy life ‚Äî as well as figuring from Ray 's passion for Evangeline that the perfect balance is brought by having someone you love to share the experience .
Tiana became the first African - American Disney Princess .
VOICE CAST Section::::Voice cast .
On December 1 , 2006 , a detailed casting call was announced for the film at the Manhattan Theatre Source forum .
The casting call states the film as being an American fairy tale musical set in New Orleans during the 1920s Jazz Age and provides a detailed list of the film 's major characters .
In February 2007 , it was reported that Dreamgirls actresses Jennifer Hudson and Anika Noni Rose were top contenders for the voice of Tiana , and that Alicia Keys directly contacted Walt Disney Studios chairman Dick Cook about voicing the role .
It was later reported that Tyra Banks was considered for the role as well .
By April 2007 , it was confirmed that Rose would be voicing Tiana .
Three months later , it was reported that Keith David would be doing the voice of Doctor Facilier , the villain of the film .
ANIMATION AND DESIGN Section::::Animation and design .
Clements and Musker had agreed early on that the style they were aiming for was primarily that of Lady and the Tramp ( 1955 ) , a film which they and John Lasseter feel represents " the pinnacle of Disney 's style " . "
After that , everything started becoming more stylized , like Sleeping Beauty , 101 Dalmatians ‚Äî which are fantastic films as well , but there 's a particular style ( to Lady and the Tramp )
that 's so classically Disney .
" Lady and the Tramp also heavily informed the style of the New Orleans scenes , while Disney 's Bambi ( 1942 ) served as the template for the bayou scenes .
Bambi was described as a stylistic reference for the painted backgrounds , as according to art director Ian Gooding
" Bambi painted what it feels like to be in the forest instead of the forest
" so The Princess and the Frog would in turn try capturing the essence of roaming through New Orleans .
The former trend in Disney 's hand - drawn features where the characters and cinematography were influenced by a CGI - look has been abandoned .
Andreas Deja , a veteran Disney animator who supervised the character of Mama Odie , says " I always thought that maybe we should distinguish ourselves to go back to what 2D is good at , which is focusing on what the line can do rather than volume , which is a CG kind of thing .
So we are doing less extravagant Treasure Planet kind of treatments .
You have to create a world but
[ we 're doing it more simply ] .
What we 're trying to do with Princess and the Frog is hook up with things that the old guys did earlier .
It 's not going to be graphic ‚Ä¶ " .
Deja also mentions that Lasseter was aiming for the Disney sculptural and dimensional look of the 1950s : " All those things that were non - graphic , which means go easy on the straight lines and have one volume flow into the other ‚Äî an organic feel to the drawing . "
Lasseter also felt that traditional animation created more character believability .
For example , with Louis the alligator , created by Eric Goldberg , Lasseter said : " It 's the believability of this large character being able to move around quite like that . "
Choreographer Betsy Baytos was brought by the directors to lead a team of eccentric dancers that gave reference to make each character a different style of movement .
The character design tried to create beautiful drawings through subtle shapes , particularly for most characters being human .
For the frog versions of Tiana and Naveen , while the animators started with realistic designs , they eventually went for cutesy characters " removing all that is unappealing in frogs " , similar to Pinocchios Jiminy Cricket .
Toon Boom Animation 's Toon Boom Harmony software was used as the main software package for the production of the film , as the Computer Animation Production System ( CAPS ) system that Disney developed with Pixar in the 1980s for use on their previous traditionally animated films had become outdated .
The Harmony software was augmented with a number of plug - ins to provide CAPS - like effects such as shading on cheeks and smoke effects .
The reinstated traditional unit 's first production , a 2007 Goofy cartoon short entitled How to Hook Up Your Home Theater , was partly animated without paper by using Harmony and Wacom Cintiq pressure - sensitive tablets .
The character animators found some difficulty with this approach , and decided to use traditional paper and pencil drawings , which were then scanned into the computer systems , for The Princess and the Frog .
The one exception to the new Toon Boom Harmony pipeline was the " Almost There " dream sequence , which utilized an Art Deco graphic style based on the art of Harlem Renaissance painter Aaron Douglas .
Supervised by Eric Goldberg and designed by Sue Nichols , the " Almost There " sequence 's character animation was done on paper without going through the clean - up animation department , and scanned directly into Photoshop .
The artwork was then enhanced to affect the appearance of painted strokes and fills , and combined with backgrounds , using Adobe After Effects .
The visual effects and backgrounds for the film were created digitally using Cintiq tablet displays .
Marlon West , one of Disney 's veteran animation visual effects supervisors , says about the production ; " Those guys had this bright idea to bring back hand - drawn animation , but everything had to be started again from the ground up .
One of the first things we did was focus on producing shorts , to help us re - introduce the 2D pipeline .
I worked as vfx supervisor on the Goofy short , How to Hook Up Your Home Theater .
It was a real plus for the effects department , so we went paperless for The Princess and the Frog .
" The backgrounds were painted digitally using Adobe Photoshop , and many of the architectural elements were based upon 3D models built in Autodesk Maya .
Much of the clean - up animation , digital ink - and - paint , and compositing were outsourced to third - party companies in Orlando , Florida ( Premise Entertainment ) , Toronto , Ontario , Canada ( Yowza Digital Animation ) , and Brooklin , S√£o Paulo , Brazil ( HGN Produ√ß√µes ) .
MUSIC Section::::Music .
During Disney 's 2007 shareholder meeting , Randy Newman and the Dirty Dozen Brass Band performed the film 's opening number , " Down in New Orleans " , with famous New Orleans singer Dr. John singing , while slides of pre - production art from the film played on a screen .
Other songs in the film include "
Almost There " ( a solo for Tiana ) , " Dig a Little Deeper " ( a song for Mama Odie ) , " When We 're Human " ( a song for Louis , Tiana and Naveen [ as frogs ] ) , " Friends on the Other Side " ( a solo for Doctor Facilier ) , and " Gon na Take You There " and " Ma Belle Evangeline " ( two solos for Ray ) .
Newman composed , arranged , and conducted the music for the film , a mixture of jazz , zydeco , blues , and gospel styles performed by the voice cast members for the respective characters while R&B singer - songwriter Ne - Yo wrote and performed the end title song "
Never Knew I Needed " , an R&B love song referring to the romance between the film 's two main characters , Tiana and Naveen .
Supported by a music video by Melina , " Never Knew I Needed " was issued to radio outlets as a commercial single from the .
The film 's soundtrack album , The Princess and the Frog : Original Songs and Score , contains the ten original songs from the film and seven instrumental pieces .

RECEPTION Section::::Reception .
The financial and critical success of The Princess and the Frog persuaded Disney to green - light at least one new hand - drawn animated film to be released every two years .
However , the blog /Film noted in July 2014 with the release of hand - drawn concept art for the 2013 computer animated film Frozen , that any future hand - drawn animated films have been " killed " for the time being due to The Princess and the Frog failing " to ignite the box office " .
Two months later , however , many Disney artists announced they were working on a new independent hand - drawn animated film , Hullabaloo , as part of an attempt to bring back hand - drawn animation .
Despite such speculation , Walt Disney Animation Studios has continued to use both hand - drawn animation and computer animation in subsequent films .
BOX OFFICE Section::::Box office .
On its limited day release , the film grossed $ 263,890 at two theaters and grossed $ 786,190 its opening weekend .
On its opening day in wide release , the film grossed $ 7 million at 3,434 theaters .
It went on to gross $ 24.2 million over the opening weekend averaging $ 7,050 per theater , ranking at # 1 for the weekend , and making it the highest - grossing start to date for an animated movie in December , a record previously held by Beavis and Butt - Head
Do America .
The film went on to gross $ 104.4 million ( in the United States and Canada ) and $ 267 million ( worldwide ) , making it a box office success , and became the fifth - highest - grossing animated film of 2009 .
While the film did out - gross Disney 's more recent hand - drawn films such as The Emperor 's New Groove , , Treasure Planet , Brother Bear , and Home on the Range , it was less auspicious than the animated films from Walt Disney Animation Studios ' 1990s heyday .
Disney animator Tom Sito compared the film 's box office performance to that of The Great Mouse Detective ( 1986 ) , which was a step up from the theatrical run of the 1985 box office bomb The Black Cauldron .
Looking back on the experience four years later , Catmull acknowledged that Disney had made a " serious mistake " in the process of marketing and releasing the film .
Walt Disney Studios ' marketing department had warned Disney Animation that the word " princess " in the title " would lead moviegoers to think that the film was for girls only , " but the animation studio 's management insisted on keeping the " princess " title because they truly believed that the film 's excellent quality and beautiful hand - drawn animation would bring in all quadrants anyway .
In Catmull 's words , this belief " was our own version of a stupid pill . "
The marketing department turned out to be correct in their prediction that many moviegoers would and did avoid the film because they thought it was " for little girls only .
" This error was further compounded by the fact that the film opened a week before Avatar .
Looking back seven years later , Lasseter told Variety : " I was determined to bring back [ hand - drawn animation ] because I felt it was such a heritage of the Disney studio , and I love the art form ‚Ä¶ I was stunned that Princess did n't do better .
We dug into it and did a lot of research and focus groups .
It was viewed as old - fashioned by the audience . "
CRITICAL RECEPTION Section::::Critical reception .
The film received largely positive reviews from critics , praising the animation , characters , music and themes .
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 85 % of 192 critics have given the film a positive review , with a rating average of 7.4/10 .
The site 's general consensus is that " The warmth of traditional Disney animation makes this occasionally lightweight fairy - tale update a lively and captivating confection for the holidays .
"
Metacritic , which assigns a weighted average score out of 0‚Äì100 from film critics , has a rating score of 73 based on 29 reviews .
Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an " A " grade and applauded the film 's creative team for " uphold[ing ] the great tradition of classic Disney animation " .
Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised Walt Disney Animation for " rediscovering its traditional hand - drawn animation " and for " a thing called story " .
David Germain of the Associated Press wrote that " The Princess and the Frog is not the second coming of Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King .
It 's just plain pleasant , an old - fashioned little charmer that 's not straining to be the next glib animated compendium of pop - culture flotsam . "
Justin Chang of Variety was less receptive , stating " this long - anticipated throwback to a venerable house style never comes within kissing distance of the studio 's former glory " .
Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News gave the film 3/5 stars while saying " The Princess and the Frog breaks the color barrier for Disney princesses , but is a throwback to traditional animation and her story is a retread " .
Village Voices Scott Foundas found that " the movie as a whole never approache[d ] the wit , cleverness , and storytelling brio of the studio 's early-1990s animation renaissance ( Beauty and the Beast , The Lion King ) or pretty much anything by Pixar " .
Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a positive review claiming that " the dialogue is fresh - prince clever , the themes are ageless , the rhythms are riotous and the return to a primal animation style is beautifully executed . "
Chicago Sun - Times film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and admired Disney 's step back to traditional animation , writing , "
No 3-D !
No glasses !
No extra ticket charge !
No frantic frenzies of meaningless action !
And ‚Ä¶ good gravy !
A story !
Characters !
A plot !
This is what classic animation once was like ! " , but stated that the film " inspires memories of Disney 's Golden Age it does n't quite live up to , as I 've said , but it 's spritely and high - spirited , and will allow kids to enjoy it without visually assaulting them . "

LEGACY
*
Tiana made a guest - appearance on Sofia the First in the second - season episode " Winter 's Gift " .
* Tiana , Prince Naveen , Eudora and Dr. Facilier appear on the seventh season of Once Upon a Time .
Maldonia also appears as a realm in New Fairy Tale Land .
* Tiana ( voiced by Rose ) is featured in the 2018 film Ralph Breaks the Internet , alongside all the other Disney Princesses .
However , her appearance has changed to have a lighter skin tone , a narrower nose , and European features .
This led to several backlashes from the viewers on social media as these drew her appearance away from that expected of African - Americans .
As a result , Anika Noni Rose and the advocacy group Color of Change contacted Disney to redesign Tiana for Ralph Breaks the Internet to make the character look closer to her actual appearance , which was reintroduced in the second trailer .
