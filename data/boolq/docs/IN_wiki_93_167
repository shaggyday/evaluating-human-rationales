The memoir details the events which occur as a result of Piper Kerman 's involvement with Nora Jansen , a former friend , lover and drug smuggler .
In 1993 , shortly after her graduation from Smith College , Kerman agreed to accompany Jansen on several trips to Asia and Europe , going as far as carrying a suitcase of laundered money across the Atlantic Ocean before returning to San Francisco to " piece her life back together " .
In May 1998 , Kerman was visited by two Customs agents , and six years later she was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison .

RECEPTION Section::::Reception .
Sasha Abramsky of the Columbia Journalism Review stated that the book " documents the author 's attempts to preserve her individuality in the face of a gray , impersonal bureaucracy — one prisoner counts , strip searches , rules governing the minutiae of life , and continual reminders that prisoners , by definition , have no power , no real autonomy . "
Abramsky wrote that the book is mostly " a journey of self - discovery , describing how one can find one 's true strengths during moments of adversity " and that it " is more similar to South African anti - apartheid activist Albie Sachs 's Jail Diary than it is to , say , Mumia Abu - Jamal 's denunciatory communiqués from Pennsylvania 's death row . "
In her review for Slate , Jessica Grose argued that the book is not an examination of women within prison but rather a member of the middle - class - transgression genre , in which women from higher level social classes go into situations which are considered degrading .
She said that the book should have included Kerman 's insight into her own behavior and " A bit of this moral ambiguity would have helped Kerman 's memoir a whole lot . "
June Thomas , also from Slate , cited Grose 's review and stated that , " Ultimately , though , the book feels like a well - written , readable stage in Kerman 's rehabilitation . "
Thomas stated that the television show had improved on the book by expanding on Kerman 's descriptions of real people and turning them into compelling fictional characters .
Writing in the Journal - Advocate , Tricia Ketchum called the book " not your typical ' I survived prison memoir ' , referring to Kerman as " spoiled " as she received multiple care packages and money into her commissary .
Ketchum concludes , " The best part of this book is the message that it leaves you with : No matter what choices you make , you never realize just how much they will impact the lives of those around you until it is too late . "
The book was selected by the UC Santa Barbara Library as its 2015 book for the university - wide reading program " UCSB Reads " .
