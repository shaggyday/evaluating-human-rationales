WHOLE - WHEAT FLOUR
Whole - wheat flour ( in the US ) or wholemeal flour ( in the UK ) is a powdery substance , a basic food ingredient , derived by grinding or mashing the whole grain of wheat , also known as the wheatberry .
Whole - wheat flour is used in baking of breads and other baked goods , and also typically mixed with lighter " white " unbleached or bleached flours ( that have been treated with flour bleaching agent(s ) ) to restore nutrients ( especially fiber , protein , and vitamins ) , texture , and body to the white flours that can be lost in milling and other processing to the finished baked goods or other food(s ) .
WHITE WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR Section::::White whole wheat flour .
White whole - wheat flour is flour milled from hard white spring wheat , rather than traditional red wheat .
In the United Kingdom and India , whole - wheat flour is more commonly made from white wheat instead of red as in the United States and sold as Wholemeal Flour .
The difference is that soft white wheat has a lower gluten content and also lacks the tannins and tayla that red wheat contain , causing white whole wheat to appear and taste more like refined red wheat ; it is whitish in color and does not taste bitter .
White whole wheat has almost the same nutrient content as red whole wheat .
However , soft white whole wheat has a lower gluten content and contains a lower protein content ( between 9 % and 11 % ) when compared with harder wheats like red ( 15â€“16 % protein content ) or golden wheat .
