DODGE CARAVAN
The Dodge Caravan is a minivan manufactured and marketed by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles ( and predecessor Chrysler companies ) and marketed under the Dodge brand .
Introduced for the 1984 model year , it is the longest - used nameplate currently in use by Chrysler .
Introduced as the Dodge version of the Chrysler minivans alongside the Plymouth Voyager ( and the later Chrysler Town & Country ) , the Dodge Caravan is currently in its fifth generation of production .
Largely marketed in the United States and Canada , outside North America , the Dodge Caravan was marketed as the Chrysler Voyager .
In North America , the Grand Caravan served as the basis for the Volkswagen Routan assembled by Chrysler .
Since 1984 , more than 11 million Chrysler minivans ( including rebadged variants and export versions ) have been sold worldwide .
Since its 1983 introduction , the Dodge Caravan has been assembled at Windsor Assembly , in Windsor , Ontario , Canada ; prior to 2010 , Saint Louis Assembly ( in Fenton , Missouri ) was an additional source of production .
FIRST GENERATION ( 1984–1990 )
Section::::First generation ( 1984–1990 ) .
Lee Iacocca and Hal Sperlich had conceived their idea for this type of vehicle during their earlier tenure at Ford Motor Company .
Henry Ford II rejected the idea ( and a prototype ) of a minivan in 1974 .
Iaccoca followed Sperlich to Chrysler , and together they created what was internally designated the T-115 minivan – a prototype that was to become the Caravan and Voyager , known in initial marketing as the Magic - wagons .
Chrysler introduced the Dodge Caravan and the Plymouth Voyager in November 1983 for the 1984 model year , using the Chrysler S platform , an extended derivative of the Chrysler K platform .
The Renault Espace launched in Europe the same year , and Chrysler began selling the Chrysler Voyager in Europe four years later .
During the 1960s , Dodge did sell a small cargo van adapted for passenger use , called the Dodge A100 which was discontinued in 1970 and replaced by the larger , fullsized Dodge B - series van in 1971 .
Interior trim , controls , and instrumentation were borrowed from the Chrysler K platform , and coupled with the lower floor enabled by the front - wheel - drive , the Caravan featured car - like ease of entry .
There were three trim levels : base , SE , and LE .
Base vans came equipped for five passengers in two rows of seating .
The LE came with seven passengers standard in three rows of seating .
The base van had two bucket seats with attached armrests and open floor space between them in the front , a three - person bench seat in the second row .
The seven - passenger came with two bucket seats with attached armrests and open floor space between them in the front , a two - person bench seat in the second row , and a three - person bench seat in the back row .
The two bench seats in the rear were independently removable , and the large three - person bench could also be installed in the second row location via a second set of attachment points on the van 's floor , ordinarily hidden with snap - in plastic covers .
This configuration allowed for conventional five person seating with a sizable cargo area in the rear .
The latching mechanisms for the benches were easy to operate though removing and replacing the seats typically required two adults .
A front low - back 60/40 split bench , accommodating a third front passenger in the middle , was offered in the SE trim level in 1985 only , allowing for a maximum of eight passengers .
This configuration was subsequently dropped .
Base model curb weight
2,910 lbs .
Safety features consisted of 3-point seat belts for the front two passengers , with simple lap belts for the rear five .
Seats on base models and cloth - trimmed SEs had no headrests , which were not mandated due to the van 's " light truck " legal status .
However , the two front seats were equipped with non - adjustable headrests on the LE model and in conjunction with vinyl upholstery on the SE .
Side - impact reinforcements were mandated , and were at all seating positions front and rear .
Neither airbags nor anti - lock braking systems were available .
Access to the rear rows of seating was by a large passenger - side sliding door enabling easy access in confined situations , e.g. , parking .
Because only one sliding door was offered , the smaller 2nd row bench seat was shifted to the driver 's side of the van , facilitating passenger access to the 3rd row seat .
To facilitate variable cargo storage behind the rear seat , the seat could be adjusted forward in two increments , the first of which removed roughly of legroom from the back row passengers , and the second of which would push the bench all the way to the back of the 2nd row , making the seats unusable .
The seat back of the rear bench could also be folded forward , providing a flat cargo shelf .
The smaller 2nd row bench was not adjustable , nor foldable ; it could only be removed entirely .
Cargo access to the rear was via a hatchback , similar to the one on the K platform station wagons .
The hatch was hinged at the top and held open by gas struts .
A long wheelbase variant , marketed as the Grand Caravan , was introduced in May 1987 .
It allowed more cargo space behind the rear seat .
A cargo version of the Caravan , called the Mini Ram Van , was also introduced for 1984 , with a flat floored cargo space four feet tall and with four feet between the wheel wells .
The load capacity was .
It was renamed the Caravan C / V for 1989 and was then discontinued after 1995 .
It was initially available with the short wheelbase ; a long - wheelbase variant was introduced alongside the Grand Caravan .
Unique to the Caravan C / V was the option of either having the traditional hatch door in the back or the optional swing - out bi - parting doors ( with or without windows ) , similar to those of more traditional cargo vans .
These doors were made of fiberglass and required the C / V vans to be " drop shipped " , as these doors were custom installed by another vendor .
Also based on the Mini Ram and C / V were aftermarket conversion vans sold through official Chrysler dealers and from the conversion companies themselves .
TRANSMISSIONS Section::::Transmissions .
Both a three - speed TorqueFlite automatic transmission and a five - speed manual were available with all inline - four engines , including the turbocharged 2.5-liter
( this was a rare combination ) .
The Plymouth Voyager , which was a rebadged version of the Caravan , was also available with a manual transmission .
The Chrysler Town & Country , which was a more luxurious repackaged version of the Caravan , had no manual transmission option .
Manual transmissions were not available on V6 models of the passenger Caravan , but were an option on the Mini Ram Van and Caravan C / V 's long wheelbase models with a 3.0 L V6 .
The V6 engines were only offered with the venerable fully hydraulically operated TorqueFlite , until the computer controlled Ultradrive four - speed automatic became available in 1989 .
The Ultradrive offered much better fuel economy and responsiveness , particularly when paired with the inline - four engine .
However , it suffered from reliability problems , usually stemming from what is known as " gear hunt " or " shift busyness " , resulting in premature wear of the internal clutches .
It also required an uncommon type of automatic transmission fluid and is not clearly labeled as such , leading many owners to use the more common Dexron II rather than the specified " Mopar ATF+3 " , resulting in transmission damage and eventual failure .
The Ultradrive received numerous design changes in subsequent model years to improve reliability , and many early model transmissions would eventually be retrofitted or replaced with the updated versions by dealers , under warranty .
These efforts were mostly successful , and most first - generation Caravans eventually got an updated transmission .
ENGINES Section::::Engines .
For the first three years of production , two engines were offered in the Caravan – both inline-4 engines with 2 barrel carburetors .
The base 2.2 L was borrowed from the Chrysler K - cars , and produced horsepower .
The higher performance fuel - injected version of the 2.2 L engine later offered in the K - cars was never offered in the Caravan , and the 2-bbl version would remain the base power plant until mid-1987 .
Alongside the 2.2 L , an optional Mitsubishi 2.6 L engine was available , producing horsepower .
In mid-1987 , the base 2.2 L I4 was replaced with a fuel - injected 2.5 L I4 , which produced , while the Mitsubishi G54B I4 was replaced with the new fuel - injected 3.0 L Mitsubishi V6 producing in March of that year .
Shortly thereafter in model year 1989 , a more powerful engine became optional , with a turbocharged version of the base 2.5 L producing .
Revisions to the Mitsubishi V6 upped its output to that same year , and in 1990 a new 3.3 L V6 was added to the option list .
The V6 engines became popular as sales of the 2.5 turbo dwindled and it was dropped at the end of the year .
In these years , the ES model debuted ( short wheelbase only ) to highlight the new engines , the turbo 2.5 in particular .
The ES was introduced to the long wheelbase Grand Caravan for 1991 and continued throughout 2003 , before it was discontinued and replaced with the SXT .

From 1991 through 1995 , the Caravan used the Chrysler AS platform ; they were the last minivans derived from the Chrysler K platform .
The increasing popularity of the short wheelbase Caravan had a dramatic effect on the captive import from Mitsubishi , called the Dodge Colt Vista , and was no longer imported to North America starting in 1991 .
The second generation had features including : * " Quad Command " bucket seating ( 1991 ) * Integrated child safety seats ( 1991 , MY1992 ) , improved design with recliners ( 1993 , MY1994 )
* Available anti - lock brakes ( 1991 )
* First driver 's side airbag in a minivan ( 1991 ) and first dual front airbags ( 1994 )
* First minivan to meet 1998 U.S. federal safety standards ( 1993 , MY1994 )
* All - wheel drive was introduced for the minivan .
( 1991 )
1992 models included revised roof - racks and doorhandles .
1993 marked the final year for optional woodgrain and wire wheels on higher level models .
1994 models had a redesigned interior , with slightly different seat contours / fabrics , along with a new dash , in order to accommodate a passenger - side air bag .
1994
exterior trim changes included a body colored grill and moldings on certain models , as well as the addition of a one - year only " 10th Anniversary Edition " package .
Available as an option on a mid - level Caravan and Grand Caravan ( also offered on Voyager models as well ) , the package featured 2-tone paint schemes , which included a contrasting light gray colored lower break , along with a gold fender badge .
Only select colors were available on this model .

Section::::Third generation ( 1996–2000 ) .
The third - generation Chrysler minivans were available in long- and short – wheelbase models ; three- and four - door configurations ; and eight different powertrains , including electric and compressed natural gas ; on a single , flexible platform .
In development for nearly 5 years from early 1990 ( full development from 1991 ) to December 26 , 1994 ( final design by Don Renkert was approved on September 23 , 1991 and frozen in May 1992 ) , the 1996 model was introduced at the 1995 North American International Auto Show using the Chrysler S platform .
It included a number of innovations , including a driver 's side sliding door ( optional initially , to become standard equipment later ) , a first for Chrysler and a non - compact minivan for the United States and Canada ( the Honda Odyssey had introduced the first four - door non - compact minivan for the United States & Canada in 1994 , although the first - generation Odyssey had conventional hinged rear doors ) .
With Generation III , Chrysler introduced a seat management system marketed as Easy Out Roller Seats .
A conventional door handle and lock was added to the rear hatch , eliminating the confusing pop - and - lift maneuver which had been required on earlier models .
Base models of the Caravan were offered in most states with either a 2.4 L four - cylinder or the 3.0 L Mitsubishi 6G72 V6 engine , except in several northeastern states , where the Mitsubishi did not meet emissions standards .
In those areas , the 3.3 L engine was offered as the V6 option from 1997 through 2000 .
The 1996 Caravan , along with the Plymouth Voyager and the Chrysler Town & Country won the North American Car of the Year award .
The Caravan itself won Motor Trend magazine 's Car of the Year 1996 and appeared on the Car and Driver Ten Best for 1996 and 1997 .
1999 also saw the addition of a one - year only 15th anniversary " Platinum Edition " , to mark Caravan 's 15th year of production .
This package was offered on various trim levels , and included Platinum Metallic paint , and fender badges .
The 2000 model year offered packages which included the " 2000 + " and " Millennium " package , however these were little more than unique fender badges on vans with popular equipment .
The Caravan received minor updates in 1997 for the 1998 model year .
These changes came in the form of new colors , new wheels for trims above SE , new interior fabric , optional heated seats and a new design for the optional auto - dimming rear view mirror .
In calendar year 1998 , the Caravan 's HVAC vents on the driver 's side and center of the dashboard were updated to have a more conventional design .
Later that year , the 1999 Caravan received new front styling on all trims above SE , while the Sport and ES models received even sportier styling .
The ES model was the first minivan to receive the " AutoStick " transmission and 17 inch wheels .
A cargo net between the driver and front passenger seats was added .
Color keyed door and lift - gate handles were standard across the whole range , in addition to a new keyless entry remote .
Base and SE models had options for a spoiler as well as color keyed bumpers and trim ( grey or color molded bumpers and trim were standard ) .
The driver 's side sliding door became standard .
Chrysler had updates of the Plymouth Voyager in 1996 for the 1997 model year and the Chrysler Town & Country in 1997 for the 1998 model year , prior to the 1998–2007 DaimlerChrysler era ; it was the only exterior update of the NS Dodge Caravan .

The Voyager XG was more rugged , featured a diesel engine and manual transmission , and included many outdoor amenities , such as a built - in ice pack .
The Chrysler Pacifica , based on the Town & Country , was more luxurious , had power leather seats and footrests , overhead bins and lighting , an LHS grille , and roof - long skylights .
The skylight feature was used by Nissan in the Quest .
The Pacifica actually did come to be in 2004 , based on the fifth generation Caravan , except that it became a crossover SUV rather than a minivan ; the nameplate was eventually applied to a minivan in 2016 .
In 1999 , Dodge introduced the Caravan EPIC , a fully electric minivan .
The EPIC was powered by 28 12-volt NiMH batteries and was capable of traveling up to on a single charge .
The EPIC was sold as a fleet - only lease vehicle .

Only a few hundred of these vehicles were produced and sold .
After the leases expired they were returned and crushed .
Approximately 10 vans remain in private hands today .
CRASH TEST RESULTS
Section::::Crash test results .
The 1996–2000 Dodge Grand Caravan received a " Marginal " rating in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety 's 40 mph offset test .
The structural performance and restraints were graded " Acceptable " , but the foot injuries were very high .
In the NHTSA crash tests , it received 4 stars for the driver and front passenger in the frontal - impact .
In the side - impact test , it received 5 stars for the driver , and 3 stars for the rear occupant , and resulted in a fuel leak that could cause a fire hazard .

The rear passengers , however , could leave this accident unharmed , as there is a low risk of significant injury in a crash of this severity for them .
FIFTH GENERATION ( 2008–PRESENT )
Section::::Fifth generation ( 2008–present ) .
The fifth generation van had debuted at the 2007 North American International Auto Show with exterior styling by Ralph Gilles .
Beginning with Generation V in model year 2008 , Chrysler only made the long wheelbase Grand Caravan .
With discontinuation of the short - wheelbase Caravan , Dodge offered the Journey on nearly an identical wheelbase and as a crossover rather than a minivan .
Although the SWB model , which had accounted for half of all sales in Canada , cost approximately $ 2,000 less and offered a four - cylinder engine option with improved fuel economy , Chrysler executives stated the SWB Caravan was discontinued to accommodate new features offered in the Grand Caravan , consistent with the demands of the majority of the minivan market .
A new six - speed automatic transmission became standard with the 3.8 L V6 and the new 4.0 L V6 .
The four - speed automatic transmission is standard with the 3.3 L Flex - Fuel V6 .
This generation of Grand Caravan and its Town & Country counterpart were not available with an all - wheel - drive system .
The previously unavailable Electronic Stability Control was made standard on this generation .
Chrysler introduced a seat management system marketed as Swivel'n Go seating , the MyGIG entertainment system ( a stereo with built in hard drive for recording , storing , and playing music ) , second and third row video screens , powered second row windows , standard side curtain airbags , and dashboard - mounted transmission controls .
The gear shift lever moved to the instrument panel , the location used by competitors .
The market shifted briefly away from minivans and SUVs with the gasoline price spikes of the earlier part of 2008 .
This trend began to reverse itself towards the fall of 2008 .
In 2009 and 2010 the Dodge Grand Caravan continued to be the top selling minivan in Canada , with over 60 % of the market 's monthly sales .
Automotive News reported that , from January to October in 2010 , Dodge sold about a third of its 2010 Grand Caravans to rental fleets .
The number of returned ex - rental 2010 Grand Caravan to the market jumped fourfold between July to October , depressing prices of used 2009 and 2010 Dodge minivans by as much as 20 % .

In Canada ( 2008–2010 )
the 3.3 L was the standard engine across the range , combined with the 4-speed 41TE automatic transmission .
The 4.0 L engine and six - speed combination was available as an option on only the top of the range SXT models .
In 2011 the six - speed transmission was specified as standard on the Town & Country .

+ IIHS 2011 MODEL YEAR UPDATE Section::::2011 model year update .
The Grand Caravan underwent a mid - cycle refresh for the 2011 model year , which included major changes in both styling and functionality .
The suspension was heavily re - tuned , with both Dodge and Chrysler minivans gaining a larger front sway bar and new rear sway bar , increased rear roll center height , adjusted spring rates , a new steering gear , a revised front static camber setting , and lowered ride height .
This dramatically improved handling in both the Chrysler and Dodge .

now the sole powertrain choice for all models .
Interior trim was restyled on both vans , in addition to major exterior revisions highlighted by the new " double - crosshair " grille on the Grand Caravan and a new chrome grille for the Town & Country .
Other changes included extra sound insulation , acoustic glass , new seats , softer - touch surfaces , new LED ambient lighting and center console , and halogen projector headlamps with LED accents .
The Chrysler models were adjusted so that instead of competing against equivalent Dodge trim levels , they were above Dodge in trim and features .
For 2012 , a new , basic style trim called " AVP " was introduced , while some features previously unavailable for " SE " ( like touch navigation panel ) become available as options ( The " SE " now also received a floor console , similar to the one available for " SXT " ) .

2018 MODEL YEAR UPDATE Section::::2018 model year update .
FCA unveiled the Chrysler Pacifica , a new crossover minivan for the 2017 model year , at the 2016 North American International Auto Show .
The Pacifica replaced the Chrysler Town & Country , but it was originally stated that the 2016 model of the Dodge Caravan would be produced for one more model year as a lower - cost alternative to the Pacifica , before being discontinued .
In January 2017 , FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne stated that it was not clear if the Caravan would be discontinued , and that they would have to look into offering " some level of affordable access to the Pacifica at the lower end to try and replace the outgoing models " .
Despite the introduction of the higher - cost Pacifica model , sales of the Caravan increased by 26 % in 2016 .
Production of Grand Caravans was temporarily suspended from September to November 2017 with the assembly of the 2018 model year versions starting in December 2017 .
The production line required changes to install airbags that meet U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 226 calling for larger and more robust side - impact air curtains , as well as for them to deploy in the event of either a side - on collision or a rollover .
Standard on all 2018 models are advanced multistage driver and front - passenger airbags that include low - risk deployment , a driver's - side inflatable knee blocker , front seat - mounted side airbags , and side - curtains for outboard passengers in all three rows .

The Caravan has incorporated numerous seating systems for their minivans to enhance interior flexibility .
INTEGRATED
CHILD SAFETY SEATS
Section::::Integrated child safety seats .
In 1991 , Dodge introduced a second row bench seat integrating two child booster seats on 1992 models .
These seats continued as an available option through Generation V until they were discontinued in 2010 .
EASY - OUT
ROLLER SEATS Section::::Easy - Out Roller Seats .
In 1995 , Dodge introduced a system of seats to simplify installation , removal , and re - positioning , marketed as Easy - Out Roller Seats .
When installed , the seats are latched to floor - mounted strikers .
When unlatched , eight rollers lift each seat , allowing it to be rolled fore and aft .
Tracks have locator depressions for rollers , to simplify installation .
Ergonomic levers at the seat backs release the floor latches single - handedly , without tools , and raise the seats onto the rollers in a single motion .
Additionally , seat backs were designed to fold forward .
Seat roller tracks are permanently attached to the floor and seat stanchions are aligned , facilitating the longitudinal rolling of the seats .
Bench seat stanchions were moved inboard to reduce bending stress in the seat frames , allowing them to be lighter .
When configured as two and three person benches ( available through Generation IV ) , the Easy Out
Roller Seats could be unwieldy .
Beginning in 2000 , second and third row seats became available in a ' quad ' configuration – bucket or captain chairs in the second row and a third row three - person 50/50 split " bench " – with each section weighing under .
The Easy - out system remained in use through Generation V – where certain models featured a two - person bench and the under - floor compartments from the Stow'n Go system .
All the rebadged nameplate variants of the Chrysler minivans use the Easy Out Roller Seats on their second row seating , where not the Stow and Go system .
STOW ' N
GO SEATING
Section::::Stow '
N
Go seating .
In 2004 , Dodge introduced a system of second- and third - row seating that folded completely into under - floor compartments .
It was marketed as Stow ' N Go and was available exclusively on long - wheelbase models .
In a development program costing $ 400 million , engineers initially used an Erector Set to visualize the complex interaction of the design and redesigned under - floor components .
The system included the spare tire well , fuel tank , exhaust system , parking brake cables , rear climate control lines , and rear suspension but precluded all - wheel drive ( AWD ) .
The system , in turn , creates a combined volume of of under - floor storage when second - row seats are deployed .
With both rows folded , the vans have a flat - load floor and a maximum cargo volume of .
The Stow ' n Go system received the Popular Science Magazine 's " Best of What 's New " for 2005 award , and was never offered on the Volkswagen Routan , the rebadged nameplate variant of the Chrysler minivans .
For model year 2011 Chrysler revised the system , rebranding it as " Super Stow ' n Go " .
New pivoting head restraints with taller seatbacks and a revised folding mechanism ( marketed as " single action " ) improved stowage ease – with the head restraints folding on themselves automatically and the entire seat automatically folding down to a position just over its floor recess .
SWIVEL '
N GO SEATING
Section::::Swivel ' n Go seating .
Dodge introduced a seating system in 2007 , marketed as Swivel ' n Go .
In the seating system , two full size second row seats swivel to face the third row .
A detachable table can be placed between the second and third row seats .
The Swivel ' n Go seating system includes the third row seating from the Stow ' n
Go system .
The system is offered on the Dodge Grand Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country , but not the Volkswagen Routan , a rebadged nameplate variant of the Chrysler minivans .
These Swivel ' n Go Seats are manufactured by
Intier Corp. a division of Magna .
The tracks , risers and swivel mechanisms are assembled by Camslide , a division of Intier .
The swivel mechanism was designed by and is produced by Toyo Seat USA Corp.
The system is noted for its high strength .
The entire load of the seat in the event of a crash is transferred through the swivel mechanism , which is almost twice as strong as the minimum government requirement .
The swivel mechanism includes bumpers that stabilize the seat while in the lock position .
When rotated the seat comes off these bumpers to allow easy rotation .
The seat is not meant to be left in an unlocked position or swiveled with the occupant in it , although this will not damage the swivel mechanism .
" Swivel ' n Go " was dropped after the 2010 model year and is no longer an option on 2011 and later Chrysler and Dodge vans .
However , the seats can still be installed by modifying the van with a few basic tools and parts .
However , it is impossible to install the table .

Section::::Production .
The long - wheelbase Dodge Grand Caravan with Stow ' n
Go seats are built in Windsor , Ontario , Canada at Windsor Assembly ( WAP Plant 3 ) by members of Canadian Auto Workers Local 444 .
