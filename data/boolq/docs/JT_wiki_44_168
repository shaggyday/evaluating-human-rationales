FOUR - POINT FIELD GOAL
A four - point field goal ( also called a four - pointer ) is a field goal in a basketball game made from a part of the court designated for a four - point shot , the designated area is typically farther from the basket than the three - point arc .
A successful attempt is worth four points , in contrast to the three points awarded for a shot beyond the three point line , two points awarded for field goals made within the three - point line and the one point for each made free throw .
The four - pointer was introduced in competition by the Harlem Globetrotters .
The BIG3 basketball league is the only current professional league that uses the four - point field goal .
In BIG3 , there are three distinct circles beyond the three - point arc designated as a four - point field goal area .
A four - point field goal is attempted when a player shoots with any part of the player 's body touching any part of the four - point circle .
