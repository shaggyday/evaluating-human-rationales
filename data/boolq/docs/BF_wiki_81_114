WOMEN 'S COLLEGE WORLD SERIES
The Women 's College World Series ( WCWS ) is the final portion of the NCAA Division I Softball Championship for college softball in the United States .
The tournament format consists of two four - team double - elimination brackets .
The winners of each bracket then compete in a best - of - three series to determine the Division I WCWS National Champion .
The WCWS takes place at ASA Hall of Fame Stadium in Oklahoma City .
From 1969 to 1981 , the women 's collegiate softball championship was also known as the Women 's College World Series and was promoted as such .
During 1969–1979 , the series was played in Omaha , and in 1980–1982 in Norman , Oklahoma .
The NCAA held its first six Division I tournaments in Omaha in 1982–1987 , followed by Sunnyvale , California in 1988–1989 .
The event has been held in Oklahoma City every year since then , except for 1996 in Columbus , Georgia .
Softball was one of twelve women 's sports added to the NCAA championship program for the 1981–82 school year , as the NCAA engaged in battle with the AIAW for sole governance of women 's collegiate sports .
The AIAW continued to conduct its established championship program in the same twelve ( and other ) sports .
The 1982 softball championship tournaments of both the AIAW and the NCAA were called " Women 's College World Series . "
However , after a year of dual women 's championships , the NCAA conquered the AIAW and usurped its authority and membership .

Criticism also centered on UCLA player Tanya Harding who was recruited from Queensland , Australia midway through the 1995 season .
After UCLA captured the NCAA National Championship , Harding , the MVP of the tournament , returned to her homeland without taking final exams or earning a single college credit .
Despite not violating any formal rules in recruiting Harding , the incident generated heated criticism that some foreign athletes were little more than hired guns .
