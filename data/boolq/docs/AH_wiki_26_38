ARM
In human anatomy , the arm is the part of the upper limb between the glenohumeral joint ( shoulder joint ) and the elbow joint .
In common usage , the arm extends to the hand .
It can be divided into the upper arm , which extends from the shoulder to the elbow , the forearm which extends from the elbow to the hand , and the hand .
Anatomically the shoulder girdle with bones and corresponding muscles is by definition a part of the arm .
The Latin term brachium may refer to either the arm as a whole or to the upper arm on its own .
ANATOMY BONES Section::::Anatomy .
Section::::Bones .
The humerus is one of the three long bones of the arm .
It joins with the scapula at the shoulder joint and with the other long bones of the arm , the ulna and radius at the elbow joint .
The elbow is the hinge joint between the end of the humerus and the ends of the radius and ulna .
The humerus can not be broken easily .
Its strength allows it to handle loading up to .
MUSCLES Section::::Muscles .
The arm is divided by a fascial layer ( known as lateral and medial intermuscular septa ) separating the muscles into two osteofascial compartments : the anterior and the posterior compartments of the arm .
The fascia merges with the periosteum ( outer bone layer ) of the humerus .
The compartments contain muscles which are innervated by the same nerve and perform the same action .
Two other muscles are considered to be partially in the arm :
* The large deltoid muscle is considered to have part of its body in the anterior compartment .
This muscle is the main abductor muscle of the upper limb and extends over the shoulder .
*
The brachioradialis muscle originates in the arm but inserts into the forearm .
This muscle is responsible for rotating the hand so its palm faces forward ( supination ) .
NERVE SUPPLY Section::::Nerve supply .
The musculocutaneous nerve , from C5 , C6 , C7 , is the main supplier of muscles of the anterior compartment .
It originates from the lateral cord of the brachial plexus of nerves .
It pierces the coracobrachialis muscle and gives off branches to the muscle , as well as to brachialis and biceps brachii .
It terminates as the anterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm .
The radial nerve , which is from the fifth cervical spinal nerve to the first thoracic spinal nerve , originates as the continuation of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus .
This nerve enters the lower triangular space ( an imaginary space bounded by , amongst others , the shaft of the humerus and the triceps brachii ) of the arm and lies deep to the triceps brachii .
Here it travels with the deep artery of the arm , which sits in the radial groove of the humerus .
This fact is very important clinically as a fracture of the shaft of the bone here can cause lesions or even transections in the nerve .
Other nerves passing through give no supply to the arm .
These include : * The median nerve , nerve origin C5-T1 , which is a branch of the lateral and medial cords of the brachial plexus .
This nerve continues in the arm , travelling in a plane between the biceps and triceps muscles .
At the cubital fossa , this nerve is deep to the pronator teres muscle and is the most medial structure in the fossa .
The nerve passes into the forearm .
*
The ulnar nerve , origin C8-T1 , is a continuation of the medial cord of the brachial plexus .
This nerve passes in the same plane as the median nerve , between the biceps and triceps muscles .
At the elbow , this nerve travels posterior to the medial epicondyle of the humerus .
This means that condylar fractures can cause lesion to this nerve .
BLOOD SUPPLY Section::::Blood supply .
The main artery in the arm is the brachial artery .
This artery is a continuation of the axillary artery .
The point at which the axillary becomes the brachial is distal to the lower border of teres major .
The brachial artery gives off an unimportant branch , the deep artery of arm .
This branching occurs just below the lower border of teres major .
The brachial artery continues to the cubital fossa in the anterior compartment of the arm .
It travels in a plane between the biceps and triceps muscles , the same as the median nerve and basilic vein .
It is accompanied by venae comitantes ( accompanying veins ) .
It gives branches to the muscles of the anterior compartment .
The artery is in between the median nerve and the tendon of the biceps muscle in the cubital fossa .
It then continues into the forearm .
The deep artery of the arm travels through the lower triangular space with the radial nerve .
From here onwards it has an intimate relationship with the radial nerve .
They are both found deep to the triceps muscle and are located on the spiral groove of the humerus .
Therefore , fracture of the bone may not only lead to lesion of the radial nerve , but also haematoma of the internal structures of the arm .
The artery then continues on to anastamose with the recurrent radial branch of the brachial artery , providing a diffuse blood supply for the elbow joint .
VEINS Section::::Veins .
The veins of the arm carry blood from the extremities of the limb , as well as drain the arm itself .
The two main veins are the basilic and the cephalic veins .
There is a connecting vein between the two , the median cubital vein , which passes through the cubital fossa and is clinically important for venepuncture ( withdrawing blood ) .
The basilic vein travels on the medial side of the arm and terminates at the level of the seventh rib .
The cephalic vein travels on the lateral side of the arm and terminates as the axillary vein .
It passes through the deltopectoral triangle , a space between the deltoid and the pectoralis major muscles .
SOCIETY AND CULTURE Section::::Society and culture .
In Hindu , Buddhist and Egyptian iconography the symbol of the arm is used to illustrate the power of the sovereign .
In Hindu tradition gods are depicted with several arms which carry specific symbols of their powers .
It is believed that several arms depict omnipotence of gods .
In West Africa , the Bambara use forearm to symbolize the spirit , which is a link between God and man .
Symbolic gestures of raising both hands signal surrender , appeal for mercy , justice .
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Section::::Clinical significance .
The cubital fossa is clinically important for venepuncture and for blood pressure measurement .
When the arm is fractured this may refer to a fracture of the humerus bone .
Veins on the arm may be taken when a coronary artery bypass graft is needed .
OTHER ANIMALS
Section::::Other animals .
In other animals , the term arm can also be used for analogous structures , ( such as one of the paired forelimbs of a four - legged animal or the arms of cephalopods ) .
In anatomical usage , the term arm may sometimes refer specifically to the segment between the shoulder and the elbow , while the segment between the elbow and wrist is the forearm .
However , in common , literary , and historical usage , arm refers to the entire upper limb from shoulder to wrist .
This article uses the former definition ; see upper limb for the wider definition .
In primates the arm is adapted for precise positioning of the hand and thus assist in the hand 's manipulative tasks .
The ball and socket shoulder joint allows for movement of the arms in a wide circular plane , while the structure of the two forearm bones which can rotate around each other allows for additional range of motion at that level .
