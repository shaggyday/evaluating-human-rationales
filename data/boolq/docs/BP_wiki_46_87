ASSIST ( BASEBALL )
In baseball , an assist ( denoted by A ) is a defensive statistic , baseball being one of the few sports in which the defensive team controls the ball .
An assist is credited to every defensive player who fields or touches the ball ( after it has been hit by the batter ) prior to the recording of a putout , even if the contact was unintentional .
For example , if a ball strikes a player 's leg and bounces off him to another fielder , who tags the baserunner , the first player is credited with an assist .
A fielder can receive a maximum of one assist per out recorded .
An assist is also credited if a putout would have occurred , had another fielder not committed an error .
For example , a shortstop might field a ground ball cleanly , but the first baseman might drop his throw .
In this case , an error would be charged to the first baseman , and the shortstop would be credited with an assist .
If a pitcher records a strikeout where the third strike is caught by the catcher , the pitcher is not credited with an assist .
However , if the batter becomes a baserunner on a dropped third strike and the pitcher is involved in recording a putout by fielding the ball and either tagging the runner out or throwing to first base for the out , the pitcher is credited with an assist just as any other fielder would be .
Assists are an important statistic for outfielders , as a play often occurs when a baserunner on the opposing team attempts to advance on the basepaths when the ball is hit to the outfield ( even on a caught fly ball that results in an out ; see tag up ) .
It is the outfielder 's job to field the ball and make an accurate throw to another fielder who is covering the base before the runner reaches it .
The fielder then attempts to tag the runner out .
This is especially important if the runner was trying to reach home plate , as the assist and tag prevent the baserunner from scoring a run .
Assists are much rarer for outfielders than infielders ( with the exception of first basemen ) because the play is harder to make , and also because outfielder assist situations occur less often than the traditional ground - ball assist for a shortstop , second baseman , or third baseman .
However , as a result , outfield assists are worth far more than infield assists , and tell more about an outfielder 's throwing arm than infielder assists do .
In recent years , some sabermetricians have begun referring to assists by outfielders as baserunner kills .
Some sabermetricians are also using baserunner holds as a statistic to measure outfield arms .
