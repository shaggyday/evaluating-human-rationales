OHIO 'S 12TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT Ohio 's 12th congressional district is a United States congressional district in central Ohio , covering Delaware County , Morrow County , and Licking County , along with parts of Franklin , Marion , Muskingum , and Richland counties .
The district includes communities north and east of Columbus including Zanesville , Mansfield , and Dublin .
On January 15 , 2018 , the district 's representative Pat Tiberi resigned .
A special election was held on August 7 , 2018 to fill the vacancy for the remainder of Tiberi 's term , which ends on November 6 , 2018 .
At the special election , the Republican candidate was Troy Balderson , who was endorsed by President Trump , and the Democratic candidate was Danny O'Connor .
On August 24 , Balderson was officially declared winner of the special election , which witnessed a significant swing away from the Republican Party .
From 2003 to 2013 the district included eastern Columbus , including most of its heavily African - American neighborhoods .
The district also took in most of its northern suburbs , including Westerville .
It was one of two districts that split the capital , the other being the 15th District .
For most of the time from the 1980s to the 2000s , it was considered to be less Republican than the 15th , in part due to its large black population .
However , redistricting after the 2010 census drew nearly all of the 15th 's black constituents into the 3rd District , while the 15th was pushed into more exurban and Republican areas north and east of the capital .
It has been in Republican hands since 1920 , except for an eight - year stretch in the 1930s and a two - year term in 1980 where the Democratic Party held the seat ; in both instances the Democratic incumbent was later defeated by a GOP challenger .
In the 2004 presidential election George W. Bush narrowly won the district against John Kerry , 51 % to 49 % .
However , in the 2008 presidential election , Democratic candidate Barack Obama won the 12th district by a margin of 53 % to 46 % .
After the 2011 redistricting cycle , the district has since been won in larger margins by Republican presidential candidates .
