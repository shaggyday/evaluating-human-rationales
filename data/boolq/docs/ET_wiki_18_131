PROXY VOTING Proxy voting is a form of voting whereby a member of a decision - making body may delegate his or her voting power to a representative , to enable a vote in absence .
The representative may be another member of the same body , or external .
A person so designated is called a " proxy " and the person designating him or her is called a " principal " .
Proxy appointments can be used to form a voting bloc that can exercise greater influence in deliberations or negotiations .
Proxy voting is a particularly important practice with respect to corporations ; in the United States , investment advisers often vote proxies on behalf of their client accounts .
The United States parliamentary manual Riddick 's Rules of Procedure notes that , under proxy voting , voting for officers should be done by ballot , due to the difficulties involved in authentication if a member simply calls out , " I cast 17 votes for Mr. X. " Proxy voting is also an important feature in corporate governance through the proxy statement .
Companies use proxy solicitation agencies like Boudicca Proxy Consultants to secure proxy votes .
LEGISLATURES
Section::::Legislatures .
The rules of some assemblies presently forbid proxy voting .
For example , in both houses of the U.S. Congress , as well as in most if not all state legislatures , each member must be present and cast his own vote for that vote to be counted .
This can result , however , in the absence of a quorum and the need to compel attendance by a sufficient number of missing members to get a quorum .
See call of the house .
It is possible for automatic proxy voting to be used in legislatures , by way of direct representation
( this idea is essentially a form of Weighted voting ) .
For example , it has been proposed that instead of electing members from single - member districts ( that may have been gerrymandered ) , members be elected at large , but when seated each member cast the number of votes he or she received in the last election .
Thus , if , for example , a state were allocated 32 members in the U.S. House of Representatives , the 32 candidates who received the most votes in the at - large election would be seated , but each would cast a different number of votes on the floor and in committee .
This proposal would allow for representation of minority views in legislative deliberations , as it does in deliberations at shareholder meetings of corporations .
Such a concept was proposed in a submission to the 2007 Ontario Citizens ' Assembly process .
Two real - life examples of weighted voting include the Council of Ministers of the European Union and the US Electoral College .
The Parliament of New Zealand allows proxy voting .
Sections 155 - 156 of the Standing Orders of the New Zealand House of Representatives specify the procedures for doing so .
A member can designate another member or a party to cast his vote .
However , a party may not exercise proxies for more than 25 % of its members ( rounded upwards ) .
The New Zealand Listener notes a controversial occurrence of proxy voting .
The Labour Party was allowed to cast votes on behalf of Taito Phillip Field , who was frequently absent .
Theoretically , this was to be allowed only if a legislator was absent on parliamentary business , public business or pressing private business , such as illness or bereavement .
Until the Republican reforms of 1995 banished the practice , proxy voting was also used in U.S. House of Representatives committees .
Often members would delegate their vote to the ranking member of their party in the committee .
Republicans opposed proxy voting on the grounds that it allowed an indolent Democratic majority to move legislation through committee with antimajoritarian procedures .
That is , the Democratic leader in the committee would successfully oppose the sitting Republican majority by wielding the proxies of absent Democrats .
Thomas E. Mann and Norman J. Ornstein write , " In a large and fragmented institution in which every member has five or six places to be at any given moment , proxy voting is a necessary evil " .
ELECTIONS Section::::Elections .
Proxy voting is sometimes described as " the frequency with which spouses , union workers , and friends of friends are in effect sent off to the polls with an assignment to complete .
" The potential for proxy voting exists in roughly one voter out of five , and it is about twice as high at the middle levels of the sophistication continuum .
According to W. Russell Neuman , the net effect of the cues provided by friends and associates is not likely to be as significant as those of the political parties .
The possibility of expanded use of proxy voting has been the subject of much speculation .
Terry F. Buss et al .
write that internet voting would result in de facto approval of proxy voting , since passwords could be shared with others : "
Obviously , cost - benefit calculations around the act of voting could also change substantially as organizations attempt to identify and provide inducements to control proxy votes without violating vote - buying prohibitions in the law . "
One of the criticisms of proxy voting is that it carries a risk of fraud or intimidation .
Another criticism is that it violates the concept of a secret ballot , in that paperwork may be filed , for instance , designating a party worker as one 's proxy .
It has been proposed that proxy voting be combined with initiative and referendum to form a hybrid of direct democracy and representative democracy .
James C. Miller III , Ronald Reagan 's budget director , suggested scrapping representative democracy and instead implementing a " program for direct and proxy voting in the legislative process .
" It has been suggested by Joseph Francis Zimmerman that proxy voting be allowed in New England town meetings .
Proxy voting can eliminate some of the problems associated with the public choice dilemma of bundling .

GABON Section::::Gabon . According to Mim Kelber , " in Central Africa , all it takes for a man to cast a proxy vote for his wife is to produce an unwitnessed letter mentioning the name of the person to whom the voting power is delegated . "
The Gabon respondent to an Inter - Parliamentary Union letter commented , " It has been observed that this possibility was exploited to a far greater extent by men than by women , for reasons not always noble . "
GUYANA Section::::Guyana .
Proxy voting played an important role in Guyana politics in the 1960s .

After that election , the Commonwealth Team of Observers voiced concern about proxy votes being liable to fraud .
The proxy voting rules were relaxed further , and in 1969 , official figures recorded 19,287 votes cast by proxy , about 7 % of the total votes cast ( an increase from 2.5 % in 1964 to 1968 ) .

"
According to Charles Seymour and Donald Paige Frary , had not proxy voting been implemented , the inhabitants of the frontier towns would have lost their franchises , and the government would have represented only the freemen in the vicinity of Boston .
The roads were poor ; the drawing of all a village 's men at once would have exposed it to Indian attacks ; and at election time , the emigrants ' labor was needed to get the spring planting into the ground .
As late as 1680 , and probably even after the charter was revoked in 1684 , the Freeman might give his vote for Magistrates in person or proxy at the Court of Elections .
Proxy voting was also adopted in colonies adjacent to Massachusetts .
Indeed , traces of the practice of proxy voting remained in Connecticut 's election laws until the final supersedure of her charter in 1819 .
In Maryland , the primary assemblies allowed proxy voting .
After the assembly of 1638 , protests were sent to the proprietor in England .

Proxy voting was used in Long Island , New York as well , at that time .
Phraseology was sometimes designed to hide the fact that a proxy system was in use and that the majority of voters did not actually attend the elections .
In Rhode Island , the system described as a " proxy " system , from 1664 onward , was actually simply the sending of written ballots from voters who did not attend the election , rather than a true proxy system , as in the assembly of 1647 .
In Alabama , the Perry County Civic League 's members ' assisting illiterate voters by marking a ballot on their behalf was deemed " proxy voting " and " voting more than once " and thus held to be illegal .
During the American Civil War , some northern soldiers used proxy voting .
After Ira Eastman 's near - victory in New Hampshire , Republicans supported a bill to allow soldiers to vote by proxy , but it was ruled unconstitutional by the state supreme court .
In the Progressive Era , proxy voting was used in Republican Party state conventions in New Hampshire .
The Boston and Maine Railroad , the Republican Party 's ally , maintained control over the Party by means of these conventions .
" At the 1906 state convention , for instance , party delegates were quite willing to trade , sell , or exchange their voting power in return for various forms of remuneration from the party machine .
Public outcry led to the end of such ' proxy ' voting " .
Proxy voting was used in some American U.S. Presidential nominating caucuses .
In one case , Eugene McCarthy supporters were in the majority of those present but were outvoted when the presiding party official cast 492 proxy votes – three times the number present – for his own slate of delegates .
After the nomination of Hubert Humphrey , the New Politics movement charged that Humphrey and party bosses had circumvented the will of Democratic Party members by manipulating the rules to Humphrey 's advantage .

State parties were required to ban proxy voting in order to have their delegates seated at the national convention .
It was said that these rules had been used in " highly selective " ways .
Several attempts have been made to place proxy voting - related initiatives on the California ballot , but all have failed .
UNITED STATES LAW ON PROXIES Section::::United States law on proxies .
Proxy is defined by supreme courts as " an authority or power to do a certain thing .
" A person can confer on his proxy any power which he himself possesses .
He may also give him secret instructions as to voting upon particular questions .
But a proxy is ineffectual when it is contrary to law or public policy .
Where the proxy is duly appointed and he acts within the scope of the proxy , the person authorizing the proxy is bound by his appointee 's acts , including his errors or mistakes .
When the appointer sends his appointee to a meeting , the proxy may do anything at that meeting necessary to a full and complete exercise of the appointer 's right to vote at such meeting .
This includes the right to vote to take the vote by ballot , or to adjourn ( and , hence , he may also vote on other ordinary parliamentary motions , such as to refer , postpone , reconsider , etc . , when necessary or when deemed appropriate and advantageous to the overall object or purpose of the proxy ) .
A proxy can not vote when the principal himself is present and votes .
He can vote only in the principal 's absence .
Where the authority conferred upon a proxy is limited to a designated or special purpose , a vote for another and different purpose is ineffective .
A proxy in the usual , ordinary form confers authority to act only at the meeting then in contemplation , and in any adjourned - meetings of the same ; hence , it may not be voted at another or different meeting held under a new call .
A proxy 's unauthorized acts may be ratified by his appointer , and such ratification is equivalent to previous authority .
According to the weight of authority , a proxy only to vote stock may be revoked at any time , notwithstanding any agreement that it shall be irrevocable .
The sale in the meantime by a stockholder of his shares in a corporation or company automatically revokes any proxies made or given to vote in respect of such shares .
And a proxy is also revoked where the party giving it attends the election in person , or gives subsequent proxy .
Hence , a proxy can not vote when the owner of the stock arrives late or is present and votes .
VIETNAM Section::::Vietnam .
In Vietnam , proxy voting was used to increase turnout .
Presently , proxy voting is illegal , but it has nonetheless been occurring since before 1989 .
It is estimated to contribute about 20 % to voter turnout , and has been described as " a convenient way to fulfil one 's duty , avoid possible risks , and avoid having to participate directly in the act of voting " .
It is essentially a compromise between the party - state , which wants to have high turnouts as proof of public support , and voters who do not want to go to the polling stations .
In the Soviet Union , proxy voting was also illegal but done in order to increase turnout figures .
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION
SETTINGS Section::::Nonprofit organization settings .
Proxy voting is automatically prohibited in organizations that have adopted Robert 's Rules of Order
Newly Revised ( RONR ) or The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure ( TSC ) as their parliamentary authority , unless it is provided for in its bylaws or charter or required by the laws of its state of incorporation .
Robert 's Rules says , " If the law under which an organization is incorporated allows proxy voting to be prohibited by a provision of the bylaws , the adoption of this book as parliamentary authority by prescription in the bylaws should be treated as sufficient provision to accomplish that result " .
Demeter says the same thing , but also states that " if these laws do not prohibit voting by proxy , the body can pass a law permitting proxy voting for any purpose desired . "
RONR opines , " Ordinarily it should neither be allowed nor required , because proxy voting is incompatible with the essential characteristics of a deliberative assembly in which membership is individual , personal , and nontransferable .
In a stock corporation , on the other hand , where the ownership is transferable , the voice and vote of the member also is transferable , by use of a proxy . "
While Riddick opines that " proxy voting properly belongs in incorporate organizations that deal with stocks or real estate , and in certain political organizations , " it also states , "
If a state empowers an incorporated organization to use proxy voting , that right can not be denied in the bylaws .
"
Riddick further opines , " Proxy voting is not recommended for ordinary use .
It can discourage attendance , and transfers an inalienable right to another without positive assurance that the vote has not been manipulated . "
Parliamentary Law expounds on this point :
Nonetheless , it is common practice in conventions for a delegate to have an alternate , who is basically the same as a proxy .
Demeter 's Manual notes that the alternate has all the privileges of voting , debate and participation in the proceedings to which the delegate is entitled .
Moreover , " if voting has for years ... been conducted ... by proxy ...
such voting by long and continuous custom has the force of law , and the proceedings are valid . "
Thomas E. Arend notes that U.S. laws allow proxy votes to be conducted electronically in certain situations : " The use of electronic media may be permissible for proxy voting , but such voting is generally limited to members .
Given the fiduciary duties that are personal to each director , and the need for directors to deliberate to ensure properly considered decisions , proxy voting by directors is usually prohibited by statute .
In contrast , a number of state nonprofit corporate statutes allow for member proxy voting and may further allow members to use electronic media to grant a proxy right to another party for member voting purposes . "
Sturgis agrees , " Directors or board members can not vote by proxy in their meetings , since this would mean the delegation of a discretionary legislative duty which they can not delegate . "
Proxy voting , even if allowed , may be limited to infrequent use if the rules governing a body specify minimum attendance requirements .
For instance , bylaws may prescribe that a member can be dropped for missing three consecutive meetings .
The Journal of Mental Science noted the arguments raised against adopting proxy voting for the Association .
These included that possibility that it would diminish attendance at meetings .
The rejoinder was that people did not go there to vote ; they attending the meetings for the sake of the meeting , the discussion , and the good fellowship .
In 2005 , the Libertarian Party of Colorado , following intense debate , enacted rules allowing proxy voting .
A motion to limit proxies to 5 per person was defeated .
Some people favored requiring members attending the convention to bring a certain number of proxies , in order to encourage them to politick .
In 2006 , the party repealed those bylaw provisions due to concerns that a small group of individuals could use it to take control of the organization .
CORPORATE SETTINGS Section::::Corporate settings .
Under the common law , shareholders had no right to cast votes by proxy in corporate meetings without special authorization .
In Walker v. Johnson , the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia explained that the reason was that early corporations were of a municipal , religious or charitable nature , in which the shareholder had no pecuniary interest .
The normal mode of conferring corporate rights was by an issue of a charter from the crown , essentially establishing the corporation as a part of the government .
Given the personal trust placed in these voters by the king , it was inappropriate for them to delegate to others .
In the Pennsylvania case of Commonwealth ex rel .
Verree v. Bringhurst , the court held that members of a corporation had no right to vote by proxy at a corporate election unless such right was expressly conferred by the charter or by a bylaw .
The attorneys for the plaintiff argued that the common law rules had no application to trading or moneyed corporations where the relation was not personal .
The court found , " The fact that it is a business corporation in no wise dispenses with the obligation of all members to assemble together , unless otherwise provided , for the exercise of a right to participate in the election of their officers . "
At least as early as the 18th century , however , clauses permitting voting by proxy were being inserted in corporate charters in England .
Proxy voting is commonly used in corporations for voting by members or shareholders , because it allows members who have confidence in the judgment of other members to vote for them and allows the assembly to have a quorum of votes when it is difficult for all members to attend , or there are too many members for all of them to conveniently meet and deliberate .
Proxy firms commonly advise institutional shareholders on how they should vote .
Proxy solicitation firms assist in helping corral votes for a certain resolution .
Domini notes that in the corporate world , " Proxy ballots typically contain proposals from company management on issues of corporate governance , including capital structure , auditing , board composition , and executive compensation . "
Proxies are essentially the corporate law equivalent of absentee balloting .
Shareholders send in a card ( called a proxy card ) on which they mark their vote .
The card authorizes a proxy agent to vote the shareholder 's stock as directed on the card .
The proxy card may specify how shares are to be voted or may simply give the proxy agent discretion to decide how the shares are to be voted .
Under Securities Exchange Commission Rule 14a-3 , the incumbent board of directors ' first step in soliciting proxies must be the distribution to shareholders of the firm 's annual report .
An insurgent may independently prepare proxy cards and proxy statements , which are sent to the shareholders .
Associations of institutional investors sometimes attempt to effect social change .
For instance , several hundred faith - based institutional investors , such as denominations , pensions , etc . belong to the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility .
These organizations commonly exercise influence through shareholder resolutions , which may spur management to action and lead to the resolutions ' withdrawal before an actual vote on the resolution is taken .
Fiduciaries for ERISA and other pension plans are generally expected to vote proxies on behalf of these plans in a manner than maximizes the economic value for plan participants .
In these regard , for ERISA plans , fiduciaries and advisers are very limited in the extent to which they can take social or other goals into account .
In the absence of his principal from the annual meeting of a business corporation , the proxy has the right to vote in all instances , but he has not the right to debate or otherwise participate in the proceedings unless he is a stockholder in that same corporation .
The Securities and Exchange Commission has ruled that an investment adviser who exercises voting authority over his clients ' proxies has a fiduciary responsibility to adopt policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the adviser votes proxies in the best interests of clients , to disclose to clients information about those policies and procedures , to disclose to clients how they may obtain information on how the adviser has voted their proxies , and to keep certain records related to proxy voting .
This ruling has been criticized on many grounds , including the contention that it places unnecessary burdens on investment advisers and would not have prevented the major accounting scandals of the early 2000s .
Mutual funds must report their proxy votes periodically on Form N - PX .
It is possible for overvotes and undervotes to occur in corporate proxy situations .
Even in corporate settings , proxy voting 's use is generally limited to voting at the annual meeting for directors , for the ratification of acts of the directors , for enlargement or diminution of capital , and for other vital changes in the policy of the organization .
These proposed changes are summarized in the circular sent to shareholders prior to the annual meeting .
The stock - transfer book is closed at least ten days before the annual meeting , to enable the secretary to prepare a list of stockholders and the number of shares held by each .
Stock is voted as shown by the stock book when posted .
All proxies are checked against this list .
It is possible to designate two or more persons to act as proxy by using language appointing , for instance , " A , B , C , D , and E , F , or any of them , attorneys and agents for me , irrevocable , with full power by the affirmative vote of a majority of said attorneys and agents to appoint a substitute or substitutes for and in the name and stead of me . "
Proxy voting is said to have some anti - deliberative consequences , in that proxy holders often lack discretion about how to cast votes due to the instructions given by their principal .
Thus , they can not alter their decision based on the deliberative process of testing the strength of arguments and counter - arguments .
In Germany , corporate proxy voting is done through banks .
Proxy voting by banks has been a key feature of the connection of banks to corporate ownership in Germany since the industrialization period .
DELEGATED
VOTING Section::::Delegated voting .
In delegated voting , the proxy is transitive and the transfer recursive .
Put simply , the vote may be further delegated to the proxy 's proxy , and so on .
This is also called transitive proxy or delegate cascade .
An early proposal of delegate voting was that of Lewis Carroll in 1884 .
Delegate voting is used by the Swedish local political party Demoex .
Demoex won their first seat in the city council of Vallentuna , Sweden , in 2002 .
The first years of activity in the party have been evaluated by Mitthögskolan University in a paper by Karin Ottesen in 2003 .
In Demoex , a voter can also vote directly , even if she has delegated her vote to a proxy ; the direct vote overrules the proxy vote .
It is also possible to change the proxy at any time .
In 2005 , in a pilot study in Pakistan , Structural Deep Democracy , SD2 was used for leadership selection in a sustainable agriculture group called Contact Youth .
SD2 uses PageRank for the processing of the transitive proxy votes , with the additional constraints of mandating at least two initial proxies per voter , and all voters are proxy candidates .
More complex variants can be built on top of SD2 , such as adding specialist proxies and direct votes for specific issues , but SD2 as the underlying umbrella system , mandates that generalist proxies should always be used .
Delegated voting is also used in the World Parliament Experiment , and in implementations of delegative democracy , which is also known as liquid democracy .
