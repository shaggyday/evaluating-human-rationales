FEDERAL FOOD , DRUG , AND COSMETIC ACT
The United States Federal Food , Drug , and Cosmetic Act ( abbreviated as FFDCA , FDCA , or FD&C ) , is a set of laws passed by Congress in 1938 giving authority to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) to oversee the safety of food , drugs , medical devices , and cosmetics .
A principal author of this law was Royal S. Copeland , a three - term U.S. Senator from New York .
In 1968 , the Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions were added to the FD&C. Also in that year the FDA formed the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation ( DESI ) to incorporate into FD&C regulations the recommendations from a National Academy of Sciences investigation of effectiveness of previously marketed drugs .
The act has been amended many times , most recently to add requirements about bioterrorism preparations .
The introduction of this act was influenced by the death of more than 100 patients due to a sulfanilamide medication where diethylene glycol was used to dissolve the drug and make a liquid form(see elixir sulfanilamide disaster ) .
It replaced the earlier Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 .
CONTENTS Section::::Contents .
The FDC Act has ten chapters : FOOD COLORING Section::::Food coloring .
The FD&C is perhaps best known by the consumer because of its use in the naming of food coloring additives , such as " FD&C Yellow No . 6 .
"
The Act made the certification of some food color additives mandatory .
Some food colorings are generally recognized as safe ( GRAS ) by the FDA and do not require certification .
The FDA lists nine FD&C ( Food , Drugs & Cosmetics ) certified color additives for use in foods in the United States , and numerous D&C ( Drugs & Cosmetics ) colorings allowed only in drugs for external application or cosmetics .
Color additives derived from natural sources , such as vegetables , minerals or animals , and artificial counterparts of natural derivatives , are exempt from certification .
Both artificial and naturally derived color additives are subject to rigorous standards of safety before their approval for use in foods .
CERTIFIABLE COLORS Section::::Certifiable colors . !

There are also " D&C " colors that are only approved for use in pharmaceuticals for external application and cosmetics .
FOOD ADDITIVES
Section::::Food additives .
The FFDCA requires producers of food additives to demonstrate to a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the intended use of an additive .
If the FDA finds an additive to be safe the agency issues a regulation specifying the conditions under which the additive may be safely used .
DEFINITION OF FOOD ADDITIVE Section::::Definition of food additive .
A shortened definition of " food additive " is defined by the FDA as " any substance the intended use of which results or may reasonably be expected to result , directly or indirectly , in its becoming a component or otherwise affecting the characteristic of any food ( including any substance intended for use in producing , manufacturing , packing , processing , preparing , treating , packaging , transporting , or holding food ; and including any source of radiation intended for any such use ) ; if such substance is not GRAS or sanctioned prior to 1958 or otherwise excluded from the definition of food additives .
" The full definition can be found in Section 201(s ) of the FD&C Act , which provides for any additional exclusions .
HOMEOPATHIC MEDICATIONS Section::::Homeopathic medications .
Homeopathic preparations are regulated and protected under Sections 201(g ) and 201(j ) , provided that such medications are formulated from substances listed in the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States , which the Act recognizes as an official drug compendium .
However , under separate authority of FTC Act , the Federal Trade Commission declared in November 2016 that homeopathic products can not include claims of effectiveness without " competent and reliable scientific evidence .
" If no such evidence exists , they must state this fact clearly on their labeling , and state that the product 's claims are based only on 18th - century theories that have been discarded by modern science .
BOTTLED
WATER Section::::Bottled water .
Bottled water is regulated by the FDA as a food .
The Agency has published identity standards for types of water ( mineral water , spring water ) , and regulations covering water processing and bottling , water quality and product labeling .
COSMETICS Section::::Cosmetics .
This Act defines cosmetics as " articles intended to be rubbed , poured , sprinkled , or sprayed on , introduced into , or otherwise applied to the human body ... for cleansing , beautifying , promoting attractiveness , or altering the appearance .
" Under the Act , the FDA does not approve cosmetic products , but because the Act prohibits the marketing of adulterated or misbranded cosmetics in interstate commerce , it can remove cosmetics from the market that contain unsafe ingredients or that are mislabeled .
The FDA can and does inspect cosmetics manufacturing facilities to ensure that cosmetics are not adulterated .
MEDICAL DEVICES Section::::Medical devices .
On May 28 , 1976 , the FD&C Act was amended to include regulation for medical devices .
The amendment required that all medical devices be classified into one of three classes :
* Class I : Devices that do not require premarket approval or clearance but must follow general controls .
Dental floss is a class
I device .
* Class II : Devices that are cleared using the 510(k ) process .
Diagnostic tests , cardiac catheters , hearing aids , and dental amalgams are examples of class II devices .
* Class III : Devices that are approved by the Premarket Approval ( PMA ) process , analogous to a New Drug Application .
These tend to be devices that are permanently implanted into a human body or may be necessary to sustain life .
An artificial heart meets both criteria .
The most commonly recognized class III device is an Automated External Defibrillator .
Devices that do not meet either criterion are generally cleared as class II devices .
For devices that were marketed prior to the amendment ( Preamendment devices ) and were classified as Class III , the amendment obligated the FDA to review the device to either reclassify it as a Class II device subject to premarket notification , or to require the device manufacturer to undergo the premarket authorization process and prove the safety and efficacy of the device in order to continue marketing it .
Notable examples of such preamendment devices are those used for electroconvulsive therapy , which the FDA started reviewing in 2011 .
PREMARKET NOTIFICATION ( 510(K )
, PMN ) Section::::Premarket notification ( 510(k ) , PMN ) .
Section 510(k ) of the Federal Food , Drug , and Cosmetic Act requires those device manufacturers who must register to notify FDA , at least 90 days in advance , of their intent to market a medical device .
This is known as Premarket Notification , PMN , or 510(k ) .
It allows FDA to determine whether the device is equivalent to a device already placed into one of the three classification categories .
Thus , " new " devices ( not in commercial distribution prior to May 28 , 1976 ) that have not been classified can be properly identified .
Any device that reaches market via a 510(k ) notification must be " substantially equivalent " to a device on the market prior to May 28 , 1976 ( a " predicate device " ) .
If a device being submitted is significantly different , relative to a pre-1976 device , in terms of design , material , chemical composition , energy source , manufacturing process , or intended use , the device nominally must go through a premarket approval , or PMA .
This does not always happen .
A device that reaches market via the 510(k ) process is not considered to be " approved " by the FDA .
Nevertheless , it can be marketed and sold in the United States .
They are generally referred to as " cleared " or " 510(k ) cleared " devices .
A 2011 study by Dr. Diana Zuckerman and Paul Brown of the National Research Center for Women and Families , and Dr. Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic , published in the Archives of Internal Medicine , showed that most medical devices recalled in the last five years for " serious health problems or death " had been previously cleared by the FDA using the less stringent , and cheaper , 510(k ) process .
In a few cases the devices had been deemed so low - risk that they did not need FDA regulation .
Of the 113 devices recalled , 35 were for cardiovascular issues .
This may lead to a reevaluation of FDA procedures and better oversight .
PREMARKET APPROVAL ( PMA )
Section::::Premarket approval ( PMA ) .
Premarket approval ( PMA ) is the most stringent type of device marketing application required by FDA .
Unlike the 510(k ) pathway , the maker of the medical device must submit an application to the FDA and must receive approval prior to marketing the device .
The PMA application contains information about how the medical device was designed and how it is manufactured , as well as preclinical and clinical studies of the device , demonstrating that it is safe and effective for its intended use .
Because the PMA requires a clinical trial it is significantly more expensive than a 510(k ) .
AUTOMATIC CLASS III DESIGNATION ( DE NOVO CLASSIFICATION ) Section::::Automatic Class III Designation ( De Novo classification ) .
The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 created section 513(f)(2 ) of the FD&C Act , which obligated the FDA to establish a risk - based regulatory system for medical devices .
As a result , the FDA established a " de novo " pathway for devices that would automatically be classified as Class III because there was no already - existing device that could be used a predicate for a 510k submission , but for which general controls or general and special controls could provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness .
RELATED LEGISLATION Section::::Related legislation .
The Wheeler - Lea Act , passed in 1938 , granted the Federal Trade Commission the authority to oversee advertising of all products regulated by FDA , other than prescription drugs .
