CONTINENTAL CONGRESS
The Continental Congress , also known as the Philadelphia Congress , was a convention of delegates called together from the Thirteen Colonies .
It became the governing body of the United States during the American Revolution .
The Congress met from 1774 to 1789 in three incarnations .
The first call for a convention was made over issues of the blockade and the Intolerable Acts penalizing the Province of Massachusetts Bay .
In 1774 Benjamin Franklin convinced the colonial delegates to the Congress to form a representative body .
Much of what we know today comes from the yearly log books printed by the Continental Congress called Resolutions , Acts and Orders of Congress , which gives a day - to - day description of debates and issues .
Although the delegates in the early period were divided as to whether to break from Crown rule , the second Continental Congress on July 2 , 1776 , passed a resolution asserting independence , with no opposing vote recorded .
The Declaration of Independence was issued two days later , declaring a new nation : the United States of America .
It established a Continental Army , giving command to one of its members , George Washington of Virginia .
It waged war with Great Britain , made a militia treaty with France , and funded the war effort with loans and paper money .
The third Continental Congress was the Congress of the Confederation , under the Articles of Confederation .
PREVIOUS CONGRESSES Section::::Previous Congresses .
The idea of a congress of British North American Colonies was first broached in 1754 at the start of the French and Indian war , which started as the North American front of the Seven Years War between Great Britain and France .
It met in Albany , New York from June 18 to July 11 , 1754 , and was attended by representatives from seven colonies .
Among the delegates was Benjamin Franklin of Philadelphia , who proposed that the colonies join together in a confederation .
While this idea was rejected by the Albany congress , it would be revived 113 years later among the remaining colonies of British North America to create Canada .
To present a united front in their opposition to the Stamp act , delegates of the Provinces of British North America met in the Stamp Act Congress , which convened in New York City from 7 through 25 October 1765 .
It issued a Declaration of Rights and Grievances , which it sent to the British Parliament in London .
While Parliament repealed the Stamp Act , the First Rockingham ministry rejected any presumption of authority by the American congress .
FIRST CONTINENTAL CONGRESS , 1774 Section::::First Continental Congress , 1774 .
The First Continental Congress met briefly in Carpenter 's Hall in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , from September 5 to October 26 , 1774 .
It consisted of fifty - six delegates from twelve of the thirteen colonies that were to become the United States of America .
The delegates , who included George Washington ( then a colonel of the Virginia Colony 's volunteers ) , Patrick Henry , and John Adams , were elected by their respective colonial assemblies .
Other notable delegates included Samuel Adams from Massachusetts Bay Colony , and Joseph Galloway and John Dickinson from the Province of Pennsylvania .
Peyton Randolph of Virginia was its president .
Benjamin Franklin had put forth the idea of such a meeting the year before , but he was unable to convince the colonies of its necessity until the 1773 British blockade at the port of Boston in response to the Boston Tea Party .
All of the colonies sent delegates except the newest and most southerly one , the Province of Georgia – which needed the British Army 's protection in order to contend with attacks from several Native American tribes .
Most of the delegates were not yet ready to break away from Great Britain , but they wanted the King and Parliament to act in what they considered a fairer manner .
Convened in response to the Intolerable Acts passed by Parliament in 1774 , the delegates organized an economic boycott of Great Britain in protest and petitioned the King for a redress of grievances .
The colonies were united in their effort to demonstrate to the mother country their authority by virtue of their common causes and their unity ; but their ultimate objectives were not consistent .
The Pennsylvania and New York provinces had sent with their delegates firm instructions to pursue a resolution with Great Britain .
While the other colonies all held the idea of colonial rights as paramount , they were split between those who sought legislative equality with Britain and those who instead favored independence and a break from the Crown and its excesses .
On October 26 , 1774 , the First Continental Congress adjourned ; but it agreed to reconvene in May 1775 , if Parliament still had not addressed their grievances .
SECOND CONTINENTAL CONGRESS , 1775–1781 Section::::Second Continental Congress , 1775–1781 .
In London , Parliament debated the merits of meeting the demands made by the colonies ; however , it took no official notice of Congress 's petitions and addresses .
On November 30 , 1774 , King George III opened Parliament with a speech condemning Massachusetts and the Suffolk Resolves .
At that point it became clear that the Continental Congress would have to convene once again .
The Second Continental Congress convened on May 10 , 1775 , at Philadelphia 's State House , passing the resolution for independence the following year on July 2 , 1776 , and publicly asserting the decision two days later with the Declaration of Independence .
Thomas Jefferson of Virginia drafted the declaration , and John Adams was a leader in the debates in favor of its adoption .
John Hancock of Massachusetts was the president during those debates .
To govern during the American Revolutionary War , the Second Continental Congress continued , meeting at various locations , until it became the Congress of the Confederation when the Articles of Confederation were ratified on March 1 , 1781 .
CONFEDERATION CONGRESS , 1781–1788 Section::::Confederation Congress , 1781–1788 .
The newly founded country of the United States next had to create a new government to replace the British Parliament that it was in rebellion against .
After much debate , the Americans adopted the Articles of Confederation , a declaration that established a national government made up of a one - house legislature known as the Congress of the Confederation .
It met from 1781 to 1789 .
The Confederation Congress helped guide the United States through the final stages of the Revolutionary War , but during peacetime , the Continental Congress steeply declined in importance .
During peacetime , there were two important , long - lasting acts of the Confederation Congress : *
The passage of the Northwest Ordinance in 1787 .
This ordinance accepted the abolition of all claims to the land west of Pennsylvania and north of the Ohio River by the states of Pennsylvania , Virginia , New York , Connecticut , and Massachusetts , and the ordinance established Federal control over all of this land in the Northwest Territory — with the goal that several new states should be created there .
In the course of time , this land was divided over the course of many decades into Ohio , Michigan , Indiana , Illinois , Wisconsin , and part of Minnesota .
*
* After years of frustration , an agreement was reached in 1786 at the Annapolis Convention to call another convention in May 1787 in Philadelphia with the mission of writing and proposing a number of amendments to the Articles of Confederation to improve the form of government .
The report was sent to the Confederation Congress and the State .
The result was the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 , which was authorized by all the States thus fulfilling the unanimous requirement of the Articles of Confederation to allow changes to the Articles .
* Under the Articles of Confederation , the Confederation Congress had little power to compel the individual states to comply with any of its decisions .
More and more prospective delegates elected to the Confederation Congress declined to serve in it .
The leading men in each State preferred to serve in the state governments , and thus the Continental Congress had frequent difficulties in establishing a quorum .
When the Articles of Confederation were superseded by the Constitution of the United States , the Confederation Congress was superseded by the United States Congress .
The Confederation Congress finally set up a suitable administrative structure for the Federal government .
It put into operation a departmental system , with ministers of finance , of war , and of foreign affairs .
Robert Morris was selected as the new Superintendent of Finance , and then Morris used some ingenuity and initiative — along with a loan from the French Government — to deal with his empty treasury and also runaway inflation , for a number of years , in the supply of paper money .
As the ambassador to France , Benjamin Franklin not only secured the " bridge loan " for the national budget , but he also persuaded France to send an army of about 6,000 soldiers across the Atlantic Ocean to America — and also to dispatch a large squadron of French warships under Comte de Grasse to the coasts of Virginia and North Carolina .
These French warships were decisive at the Battle of Yorktown along the coast of Virginia by preventing Lord Cornwallis 's British troops from receiving supplies , reinforcements , or evacuation via the James River and Hampton Roads , Virginia .
Robert Morris , the Minister of Finance , persuaded Congress to charter the Bank of North America on Dec. 31 , 1781 .
Although a private bank , the Federal Government acquired partial ownership with money lent by France .
The Bank of North America played a major role in financing the war against Great Britain .
The combined armies of George Washington and Nathanael Greene , with the help of the French Army and Navy , defeated the British in the Battle of Yorktown during October 1781 .
Lord Cornwallis was forced to sue for peace and to surrender his entire army to General Washington .
During 1783 , the Americans secured the official recognition of the independence of the United States from the United Kingdom via negotiations with British diplomats in Paris , France .
These negotiations culminated with the signing of the Treaty of Paris of 1783 , and this treaty was soon ratified by the British Parliament .
ORGANIZATION Section::::Organization .
The delegates to the Continental Congress had extensive experience in deliberative bodies before coming to Congress , with " a cumulative total of nearly 500 years of experience in their colonial legislatures , and fully a dozen of them had served as Speakers of the houses of their legislatures .
"
Both the Parliament of Great Britain and many of their own Colonial assemblies had powerful Speakers of the House and standing committees with strong chairmen , with executive power held by the British Monarch or the colonial Governor .
However , the organization of the Continental Congress was based less on the British Parliament or on local state assemblies than on the nine - colony Stamp Act Congress .
Nine of the 56 delegates who attended the First Congress in 1774 had previously attended the Stamp Act Congress in 1765 .
These were some of the most respected of the delegates , and they influenced the direction of the organization from its opening day , when decisions were made on organization and procedures that lasted over fourteen years until the Congress was adjourned on March 2 , 1788 .
The delegates chose a presiding President of the Continental Congress to monitor the debate , maintain order , and make sure journals were kept and documents and letters were published and delivered .
Otherwise , the President had little power , and he was largely a figurehead used to meet visiting dignitaries : the office was " more honorable than powerful " .
The job was not much sought after or retained for long : there were 16 Presidents in 14 years .
The turnover of delegates was enormously high as well , with an average year - to - year churn rate of 37 % by one calculation , and 39 % by session - to - session .
Of the 343 serving delegates , only 55 % ( 187 delegates ) spent 12 or more months in Philadelphia at the Congress .
Only 25 of the delegates served longer than 35 months .
This high rate of turnover or churn was not just a characteristic ; it was made into a deliberate policy of term limits .
In the Confederation phase of the Congress " no delegate was permitted to serve more than three years in any six " .
Attendance was variable : while in session , between 54 and 22 delegates were in attendance at any one time , with an average of only 35.5 members attending between 1774 and 1788 .
Between 1775 and 1781 they created a few standing committees to handle war related activities , such as the committee of secret correspondence , the treasury board , the board of war and ordnance , and the navy board .
However , most of their work was done in small " ad hoc " committees consisting of members nominated from the floor .
The delegate with the most votes became the chair of the committee .
Committees typically had 3 to 5 members : roughly 77 % of the committees had only 3 members .
They created 3,294 committees over the 14.5 year calendar life of the congress – nearly 19 committees a month .
At the opening of the Congress , when one delegate suggested they appoint a committee on rules and voting , the motion was rejected , as " every Gent . was acquainted " with the British House of Commons usage , and such a committee would be a " waste of time .
" They did write up rules of debate that guaranteed equal rights to debate and open access to the floor for each delegate .
Voting was by the " unit rule " : each state cast a single vote .
Votes were first taken within each state delegation .
The majority determined vote was considered the vote of the state on a motion : in cases of a tie the vote for the state was not counted .
The Continental Congress took on powers normally held by the British monarch and his council , such as the conduct of foreign and military affairs .
However , the right to tax and regulate trade was reserved for the states , not the Congress .
They had no formal way to enforce their motions on the state governments .
Delegates did not report directly to the President , but to their home state assemblies : its organizational structure has been described as " an extreme form of matrix management " .
It ran with very low overhead of 4 men for the 56 delegates , having only Secretary Charles Thomson as its operating officer for the whole period from 1774 to 1789 , supported by a scribe , a doorman , and a messenger .
They also appointed initially one , and later two , Congressional Chaplains .
LEGACY Section::::Legacy .
There is a long running debate on how effective the Congress was as an organization .
The first critic may have been General George Washington .
In an address to his officers , at Newburgh , New York , on March 15 , 1783 , responding to complaints that Congress had not funded their pay and pensions , he stated that he believed that Congress would do the army " complete justice " and eventually pay the soldiers . "
But , like all other large Bodies , where there is a variety of different Interests to reconcile , their deliberations are slow . "
In addition to their slowness , the lack of coercive power in the Continental Congress was harshly criticized by James Madison when arguing for the need of a Federal Constitution .
His comment in Vices of the Political System of April 1787 set the conventional wisdom on the historical legacy of the institution for centuries to come : Many commentators take for granted that the leaderless , weak , slow , and small - committee driven , Continental Congress was a failure , largely because after the end of the war the Articles of Confederation no longer suited the needs of a peacetime nation , and the Congress itself , following Madison 's recommendations , called for its revision and replacement .
Some also suggest that the Congress was inhibited by the formation of contentious partisan alignments based on regional differences .
Others claim that Congress was less ideological than event driven .
Others note that the Congress was successful in that the American people " came to accept Congress as their legitimate institution of Government " , but the " rather poor governmental record " of the Congress forced the constitutional convention of 1787 .
Political scientists Calvin Jillson and Rick Wilson in the 1980s accepted the conventional interpretation on the weakness of the Congress due to the lack of coercive power .
They explored the role of leadership , or rather the lack of it , in the Continental Congress .
Going beyond even Madison 's harsh critique , they used the " analytical stance of what has come to be called the new institutionalism " to demonstrate that " the norms , rules , and institutional structures of the Continental Congress " were equally to blame " for the institution 's eventual failure " , and that the " institutional structure worked against , rather than with , the delegates in tackling the crucial issues of the day . "
The Historian Richard P. McCormick rendered a more nuanced judgment .
He suggested that Madison 's " extreme judgment " on the Congress was " motivated no doubt by Madison 's overriding desire to create a new central government that would be empowered veto the acts of state legislatures , " but that it fails " to take any notice of the fact that while the authority of the Confederation Congress was ambiguous , it was not a nullity " .
Benjamin Irvin in his social and cultural history of the Continental Congress , praised " the invented traditions by which Congress endeavored to fortify the resistance movement and to make meaning of American independence . "
But he noted that after the war 's end , " Rather than passively adopting the Congress 's creations , the American people embraced , rejected , reworked , ridiculed , or simply ignored them as they saw fit . "
An organizational culture analysis of the Continental Congress by Neil Olsen , looking for the values , norms , and underlying assumptions that drive an organization 's decisions , noted that " the leaderless Continental Congress outperformed not only the modern congress run by powerful partisan hierarchies , but modern government and corporate entities , for all their coercive power and vaunted skills as ' leaders ' .
" Looking at their mission as defined by state resolutions and petitions entered into the Congressional Journal on its first day , it found that on the common issues of the relief of Boston , securing Colonial rights , eventually restoring harmonious relations with Great Britain , and repealing taxes , they overachieved their mission goals , defeated the largest army and navy in the world , and created two new types of republic .
Olsen suggests that the Congress , if slow , when judged by its many achievements – not the least being recognizing its flaws , then replacing and terminating itself – was a success .
