MIDNIGHT SUN
The midnight sun is a natural phenomenon that occurs in the summer months in places north of the Arctic Circle or south of the Antarctic Circle , when the sun remains visible at the local midnight .
DETAILS Section::::Details .
Around the summer solstice ( approximately 21 June in the Northern Hemisphere and 22 December in the Southern Hemisphere ) , the sun is visible for the full 24 hours , given fair weather .
The number of days per year with potential midnight sun increases the closer towards either pole one goes .
Although approximately defined by the polar circles , in practice the midnight sun can be seen as much as 55 miles ( 90 km ) outside the polar circle , as described below , and the exact latitudes of the farthest reaches of midnight sun depend on topography and vary slightly year - to - year .
Because there are no permanent human settlements south of the Antarctic Circle , apart from research stations , the countries and territories whose populations experience the midnight sun are limited to those crossed by the Arctic Circle : the Canadian Yukon , Nunavut , and Northwest Territories ; the nations of Iceland , Finland , Norway , Sweden , Denmark ( Greenland ) , Russia ; and the State of Alaska in the United States .
A quarter of Finland 's territory lies north of the Arctic Circle , and at the country 's northernmost point the sun does not set at all for 60 days during summer .
In Svalbard , Norway , the northernmost inhabited region of Europe , there is no sunset from approximately 19 April to 23 August .
The extreme sites are the poles , where the sun can be continuously visible for half the year .
The North Pole has midnight sun for 6 months from late March to late September .
The opposite phenomenon , polar night , occurs in winter , when the sun stays below the horizon throughout the day .
Since the axial tilt of the Earth is considerable ( approximately 23 degrees 27 minutes ) , the sun does not set at high latitudes in local summer .
The sun remains continuously visible for one day during the summer solstice at the polar circle , for several weeks only closer to the pole , and for six months at the pole .
At extreme latitudes , the midnight sun is usually referred to as polar day .
At the poles themselves , the sun rises and sets only once each year on the equinox .
During the six months that the sun is above the horizon , it spends the days continuously moving in circles around the observer , gradually spiralling higher and reaching its highest circuit of the sky at the summer solstice .
Because of atmospheric refraction , and also because the sun is a disc rather than a point , the midnight sun may be experienced at latitudes slightly south of the Arctic Circle or north of the Antarctic Circle , though not exceeding one degree ( depending on local conditions ) .
For example , Iceland is known for its midnight sun , even though most of it ( Grímsey is the exception ) is slightly south of the Arctic Circle .
For the same reasons , the period of sunlight at the poles is slightly longer than six months .
Even the northern extremities of Scotland ( and places at similar latitudes , such as St. Petersburg ) experience twilight throughout the night in the northern sky at around the summer solstice .
Observers at heights appreciably above sea level can experience extended periods of midnight sun as a result of the " dip " of the horizon viewed from altitude .
TIME ZONES AND DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME Section::::Time zones and daylight saving time .
The term " midnight sun " refers to the consecutive 24-hour periods of sunlight experienced north of the Arctic Circle and south of the Antarctic Circle .
Other phenomena are sometimes referred to as " midnight sun " , but they are caused by time zones and the observance of daylight saving time .
For instance , in Fairbanks , Alaska , which is south of the Arctic Circle , the sun sets at 12:47 am at the summer solstice .
This is because Fairbanks is 51 minutes ahead of its idealized time zone ( as most of the state is in one time zone ) and Alaska observes daylight saving time .
( Fairbanks is at about 147.72 degrees west , corresponding to UTC−9 hours 51 minutes , and is on UTC−9 in winter . )
This means that solar culmination occurs at about 12:51 pm instead of at 12 noon .
If a precise moment for the genuine " midnight sun " is required , the observer 's longitude , the local civil time and the equation of time must be taken into account .
The moment of the sun 's closest approach to the horizon coincides with its passing due north at the observer 's position , which occurs only approximately at midnight in general .
Each degree of longitude east of the Greenwich meridian makes the vital moment exactly 4 minutes earlier than midnight as shown on the clock , while each hour that the local civil time is ahead of coordinated universal time ( UTC , also known as GMT ) makes the moment an hour later .
These two effects must be added .
Furthermore , the equation of time ( which depends on the date ) must be added : a positive value on a given date means that the sun is running slightly ahead of its average position , so the value must be subtracted .
As an example , at the North Cape of Norway at midnight on June 21/22 , the longitude of 25.9 degrees east makes the moment 103.2 minutes earlier by clock time ; but the local time , 2 hours ahead of GMT in the summer , makes it 120 minutes later by clock time .
The equation of time at that date is -2.0 minutes .
Therefore , the sun 's lowest elevation occurs 120 - 103.2 + 2.0 minutes after midnight : at 00.19 Central European Summer time .
On other nearby dates the only thing different is the equation of time , so this remains a reasonable estimate for a considerable period .
The sun 's altitude remains within half a degree of the minimum of about 5 degrees for about 45 minutes either side of this time .
WHITE NIGHTS Section::::White nights .
Locations where the sun remains less than 6 ( or 7 ) degrees below the horizon — above 60 ° 34 ' ( or 59 ° 34 ' ) latitude south of the Arctic Circle or north of the Antarctic Circle — experience midnight twilight instead of midnight sun , so that daytime activities , such as reading , are still possible without artificial light on a clear night .
White Nights have become a common symbol of Saint Petersburg , Russia , where they occur from about 11 June to 2 July , and the last 10 days of June are celebrated with cultural events known as the White Nights Festival .
DURATION Section::::Duration .
Even though at the Arctic Circle the center of the sun is , per definition and without refraction by the atmosphere , only visible during one summer night , some part of the midnight sun is visible at the Arctic Circle from approximately 12 June until 1 July .
This period extends as one travels north : At Cape Nordkinn , Norway , the northernmost point of Continental Europe , the midnight sun lasts approximately from 14 May to 29 July .
On the Svalbard archipelago farther north , it lasts from 20 April to 22 August .
