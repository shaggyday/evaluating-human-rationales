Verne Gay of Newsday stated the series " is modeled out of particularly sturdy , comfortable and reliable material . "
He added that it is " a sober , intelligent , placidly paced drama as only the Canadians can make . "
The Chicago Sun - Timess Lori Rackl said the series " has some fun , clever and emotion - stirring moments , but they 're handicapped by cheesy montages and one too many scenarios designed to remind us of the importance of having hope . "
Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called Charlie Harris ' " spirit walk " around the hospital " an interesting solution to the problem of telling stories we 've seen a million times before .
But doing it this way ultimately does more harm than good . "
He added : " It 's not bad so much as tired . "
The San Francisco Chronicles David Wiegand called the series " a lukewarm stew of ideas from other shows ... and films ... with stock characters and situations that occasionally jerk a demi - tear or two , but with absolutely no authenticity .
The sloppy sentimentality is cheap and unearned . "
