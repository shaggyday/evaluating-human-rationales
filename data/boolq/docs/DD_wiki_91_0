ISRAEL Section::::Israel .
In Israel , smoking is prohibited in public enclosed places or commercial areas via several laws : particularly , since 1983 , the " Israel Clean Air Act " ( ( in Hebrew ) ) .
The law was amended in 2007 so that owners are held accountable for smoking in premises under their responsibility .
The second means by which smoking is regulated in Israel is via the environmental hazard law , and via criminal law smoking ( or the introduction of second - hand smoke ) may even be considered an assault .
The restrictions include all commercial entities such as lavatories , office buildings , gyms , cafés , restaurants , discos , pubs and bars , and it is illegal for the owners of such places to put ashtrays anywhere inside enclosed spaces .
Also , owners of public places must display " no smoking " signs and prevent visitors from smoking .
They can also designate a well - ventilated and completely separate area for smokers , as long as the non - smokers ' area does not fall below 75 % of the whole area .
The fine for owners of public places is ₪ 5,000 ( around US$ 1400 ) and for smokers – ₪ 1000 .
In spite of all of this , the smoke - free law has not met with 100 % compliance and smoking is still encountered in some pubs , bars and clubs .
In Israel , a 2011 law restricts smoking in railway stations and at bus stops , and prohibits the sale of tobacco from automated vending machines .
An individual may call the police in cases of smoking in a restricted environment and can also sue ( via the citizen 's court ) the smoking entity ( i.e. , both the person smoking and the facility that allowed smoking to occur ) .
Some cities are known for their rigorous enforcement of the smoke - free laws , such as the city of Be'er Sheva ( which raised revenue of 799,000 NIS ( ~215 K USD ) in 2011 through fining smoking in public places ) and Tel - Aviv , but in many municipalities the law is n't enforced .
ITALY Section::::Italy .

Only 1 % of all public establishments have opted for setting up a smoking room .
Smoking is also forbidden in all enclosed workplaces – this includes also trains and underground stations .

Kanagawa Prefecture has implemented in April 2010 the nation 's first prefecture - wide smoking ban , banning smoking in public facilities , including hospitals , schools and government offices .

meters and hotels of up to 700 sq .
metres are merely required to " make efforts " to reduce second - hand smoke .

Although still relatively few , there are a growing number of private businesses implementing voluntary smoking restrictions bans in restaurants , taxis , buildings and bars .

The act regulated smoking in public areas and prohibited tobacco sales to people under the age of 18 .
Some aspects of tobacco advertising were also regulated for example labelling .
The 1993 act was not considered to be comprehensive enough and the Tobacco Products Control Amendment Act was passed in 1999 .
This act prohibits all advertising and promotion of tobacco products , including sponsorship and free distribution of tobacco products .
The act also restricts smoking in public places , which includes workplaces , restaurants , bars , and public transport .
The act does allow for designated smoking areas ( no more than 25 % of the total floor area ) .
The act also stipulates penalties for transgressors of the law , and specifies the maximum permissible levels of tar and nicotine .
The regulations were implemented in 2001 .
The government proposed further amendments to the bill in 2007 that sought to deal with new practices designed to circumvent the Act .
These amendments also aim to bring the current law into compliance with the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control ( FCTC ) .
This framework has been ratified by the South African government .
The South African government has currently set the minimum legal age for smokers to 18 .

These were introduced in each constituent administration of the United Kingdom separately , as decided by the partially devolved governments of Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland , and the UK Parliament acting for England .
For details , see ( in chronological order of bans ) :
Scotland , Wales , Northern Ireland and England .
ENGLAND Section::::England .
Smoke - free regulations covering all indoor work - places in England , including bars , clubs and restaurants , came into force on 1 July 2007 .
Some places , such as certain smoking hotel rooms , nursing homes , prisons , submarines , offshore oil rigs , and stages / television sets ( if needed for the performance ) were initially exempted , as well as Royal Palaces , although members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords agreed to ban all smoking in the Palace of Westminster .

£ 30
( ~€35/~$45 )
if one pays within 15 days , while a business that allows smoking can be fined £ 2,500 ( ~€3,700/~$3,800 ) .
Smoking largely remains permitted outdoors , apart from railway stations .

A £ 200 fine may be levied by local councils if businesses fail to display no - smoking signs .
An opinion poll showed that 91 % of people supported the law .
SCOTLAND
Section::::Scotland .
On 26 March 2006 , Scotland prohibited smoking in enclosed ( more than 50 % covered ) public places , which includes public buildings , workplaces , sports stadiums , bars and restaurants .
Exemptions are in place to allow hotel guests to smoke in their own rooms , as long as the hotel has designated them as smoking rooms .
The law restricts smoking in bus shelters , phone boxes or other shelters that are more than 50 % enclosed .
It also prohibits smoking in trucks and vans owned by a company , whether or not the driver is the only person inside ( though smoking while driving was already legally questionable as it could be presented as " driving without due care and attention " ) .
Nevertheless , the ban on smoking in work vehicles is commonly flouted , especially by tradesmen , and compliance with outdoor bans is minimal .
There are no restrictions on smoking in railway stations as the railway bylaw applies only to England , and smoking remains common in outdoor areas of railway stations .
Compliance with the indoor ban in pubs , restaurants and other workplaces is almost universal .
Businesses covered by the smoking ban must display a statutory smoking sign at the entrance to , and around the building as well as a smoke - free policy .
Opinion polls at its introduction showed a clear majority of the Scottish public were in favour of the ban
As in New Zealand , the smoke - free law was initially criticised by certain interested groups ( e.g. , publicans , cafe and bingo hall owners , etc . ) who feared that it would adversely impact their businesses .
A survey published by the Scottish Beer & Pubs Association one year on from implementation concluded that " the number of pub licensed premises in Scotland has remained more or less constant over the last year " indicating fears of an adverse impact of the ban on the hospitality industry
were unfounded .
Widespread concerns prior to implementation about the impact on bingo halls prove harder to objectively assess :
As at May 2008 there is anecdotal evidence to suggest an increase in closures of bingo halls since implementation .
However , no statistical analysis has been conducted and speculation within the betting and gaming industry is that a decline could also be the result of demographic changes and increases in online gaming .
The NHS Scotland Quit Smoking Line reported it received an additional 50,000 calls from people wishing to give up in the six months after the smoke - free law was introduced .
In September 2007 a study of nine Scottish hospitals over the twelve months following implementation reported positively on its impact on the country 's health , including a 17 % drop in admissions for heart attacks , compared with average reductions of 3 % per year for the previous decade .
WALES Section::::Wales .
Smoking was restricted across all enclosed public premises and work premises in Wales on 2 April 2007 .

yn erbyn y gyfraith " ( Welsh ) *
" It is against the law to smoke in these premises " ( English )
In addition , Wales is due to introduce a smoking ban outside schools and hospitals from Summer 2019 .
UNITED NATIONS Section::::United Nations .
As United Nations buildings are not the subject of any national jurisdiction , the United Nations has its own smoking and non - smoking policies .
Following the gradual introduction of partial smoking restrictions between 1985 and 2003 , Secretary - General Kofi Annan introduced in 2003 a total prohibition upon smoking at United Nations Headquarters .
Similar restrictions have not been introduced in field offices of the United Nations worldwide .
Some specialised agencies of the United Nations , such as the United Nations Children 's Fund and the World Health Organization have their own strict smoke - free regulations that apply to their offices worldwide , but the same is not necessarily true for entities of the Secretariat , such as the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) .
Only on 13 December 2007 , OCHA introduced a smoke - free regulation applicable to all its field offices .
UNITED STATES Section::::United States .
In the United States , Congress has not attempted to enact any nationwide federal smoking ban .

Jurisdictions in the greater South tend to have the least restrictive smoking bans or no statewide bans at all .
Of the 60 most populated cities in the United States , all but 17 ban smoking in all bars and restaurants .
According to Americans for Nonsmokers ' Rights , as of October 2012 , 81.3 % of the U.S. population is covered by bans on smoking in " workplaces , and/or restaurants , and/or bars , by either a state , commonwealth , or local law , " although only 48.7 % are covered by bans in all workplaces and restaurants and bars .
As of November 2012 , 28 states have banned smoking in all general workplaces and public places , including bars and restaurants ( though many of these exempt tobacconists , cigar bars , casinos , private clubs , and/or small workplaces ) .
Six have enacted smoking bans exempting all adult venues including bars , and in some cases casinos and restaurants ( Tennessee exempts any place not admitting patrons under 21 ) .
Georgia , Idaho , Nevada , New Hampshire , North Carolina , and Virginia have particularised state laws banning smoking in specific places but leaving out all others .
The remaining 10 states have no statewide smoking bans at all , though
many cities and/or counties in those states have enacted local smoking bans to varying degrees ( except Oklahoma , which prohibits local governments from regulating smoking at all ) .
As for U.S. jurisdictions that are not states , as of November 2012 smoking is banned in all public places ( including bars and restaurants ) in American Samoa , the District of Columbia , Puerto Rico and United States Virgin Islands .
