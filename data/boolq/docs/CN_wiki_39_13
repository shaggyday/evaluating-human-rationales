PRIZE STRUCTURE Section::::Prize structure .

The prize structure as of Tuesday 27 September 2016 is as follows : !
rowspan=2 Mainnumbers !
rowspan=2 Luckystars !
colspan=2 Probability of winning ( a ) !
rowspan=2 % of prize fund ( b ) !
rowspan=2 Expected winnings ( € ) !
rowspan=2 Expected winnings ( £ ) !

The Prize Guarantee Fund is available to contribute to the jackpot , for example to boost the initial jackpot in a sequence of growing jackpots .
The amount utilized each week is determined in advance by the participating lotteries .
* ( a ) per entry * ( b ) prize fund = 50 % of sales main draw * ( b ) sales main draw = € 2.20 in pounds sterling per entry ( exchange rate ! )
times number of entries
*
( X ) draw 1 to 6 : 43.2 % + 4.8 % & draw 7 ( or higher ) : 27 % + 21 %
* expected winnings ( £ ) exchange rate : € 1.00 = £ 0.75
*
The odds of winning any prize at all are 1 in 13 *
The odds of getting none of the 50 main balls but getting both lucky stars is approximately 1 in 115 .
This means that it is less likely than getting 2 main balls and one lucky star ( 1 in 49 ) .
However , there is no prize for only getting 2 lucky stars .
*
The figures for the estimated prize are just a guide , and the actual amount varies according to the total in the prize fund and the number of winners for each prize .
( Estimated prizes as per reverse of UK playslip )
* If the Jackpot is not won , it rolls over to the next draw .
Effective 7 November 2009
new rules were put in place regarding rollovers .
*
The new rules introduce the Jackpot Pool Cap .
The jackpot will continue to rollover until the Jackpot reaches or exceeds € 185,000,000 , the Jackpot will remain at € 185,000,000 and any additional prize money rolled over will be added to the jackpot pool for the next lower prize level containing at least one winner ( 5 main numbers + 1 Lucky Star or possibly even just five main numbers ) .
*
After winning the Jackpot with a Jackpot Pool Cap , the Jackpot Pool Cap grows by € 5,000,000 .
( In other words , after the capped Jackpot of € 185,000,000 is won , the next Jackpot Pool Cap is € 190,000,000 , then the next time € 195,000,000 etc . )
* If the € 190,000,000 Jackpot is still not won , the Jackpot will continue to be € 190,000,000 for the next draw if it is won , and again any additional prize money will be added to the jackpot pool for the next lower prize level containing at least one winner .
A new rule change of 12 January 2012 locks the Jackpot cap at € 190,000,000 permanently
and if the jackpot is not won after two draws , the prize money will be distributed amongst the winners at the next level .
A new rule change of 24 September 2016 : if the jackpot is not won after five draws , the prize money will be distributed amongst the winners at the next level .

EUROMILLIONS PLUS (
IRELAND ONLY )
Section::::EuroMillions
Plus ( Ireland only ) .
In June 2007 , with the success of the main EuroMillions game , the Irish National Lottery launched EuroMillions Plus .
For an extra € 1 per line , players could enter the additional draw with the top prize each week of € 500,000 .
Sales of the main EuroMillions in Ireland for 2006 were over € 145 million ; this success led to the introduction of ' Plus ' .
UK MILLIONAIRE MAKER Section::::UK Millionaire Maker .
Since November 2009 at least one UK player every week has won a guaranteed £ 1,000,000 .
With the introduction of the Tuesday EuroMillions Draw on Tuesday 10 May 2011 there were 2 Millionaire Raffle winners each week .
The latest changes to Euromillions in September 2016 now mean that two guaranteed Millionaire Raffle winners are made per draw , or 4 per week across the two draws .
According to the Euromillions website , the chances of winning the UK Millionaire Maker game on a Tuesday can be estimated as 1 in 1,900,000 but can shrink to 1 in 2,250,000 in the events of rollovers .
On a Friday , it can be calculated as 1 in 2,950,000 but again the odds can fall to 1 in 3,400,000 in the events of a 4 times rollover .
Winning in this game depends entirely on the number of the playslips sold so the odds fluctuate .
The odds may also fluctuate during a super draw or a special event in the UK Millionaire Raffle .
Prices per line in the UK increased by 50p to £ 2.00 .
The 50p was added due to weak exchange rates between the pound and the euro and to cover the expense of the new Millionaire Maker .
On 24 September 2016 the price per line in the UK was increased by an additional 50p to £ 2.50 .
