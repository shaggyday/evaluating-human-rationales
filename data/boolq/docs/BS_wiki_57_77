RUDY RUETTIGER Daniel Eugene " Rudy " Ruettiger ( born August 23 , 1948 ) is a motivational speaker who played college football at the University of Notre Dame .
His early life and career at Notre Dame were the inspiration for the 1993 film Rudy .
EARLY LIFE AND COLLEGE CAREER
Section::::Early life and college career .
Daniel Ruettiger ( nicknamed " Rudy " ) had a hard time in school because he was dyslexic .
He was the third of fourteen children .
He attended Joliet Catholic High School , where he played for locally famous coach Gordie Gillespie .
Ruettiger joined the United States Navy after high school , serving as a yeoman on a communications command ship for two years ; then he worked in a power plant for two years .
He applied to Notre Dame , but owing to his marginal grades , he had to do his early college work at nearby Holy Cross College .
After two years at Holy Cross , Ruettiger was accepted as a student at Notre Dame on his fourth try , in the fall of 1974 .
It was during his time studying at Holy Cross that Ruettiger discovered he had dyslexia .
Ruettiger harbored a dream to play for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team , despite being undersized at merely 5'6 " and 165 pounds .
Head coach Ara Parseghian encouraged walk - on players from the student body .
For example , Notre Dame 's 1969 starting center , Mike Oriard , was a walk - on who was eventually nominated for a Rhodes Scholarship and an NFL contract with the Kansas City Chiefs .
After working as hard as possible and showing that he was willing to work as much as he needed to , Ruettiger earned a place on the Notre Dame scout team , a practice squad that helps the varsity team practice for games .
Merv Johnson was the coach who was instrumental in keeping Rudy on as a scout - team player .
After the 1974 season , Notre Dame coach Parseghian stepped down , and former Green Bay Packers coach Dan Devine was named head coach .
In Ruettiger 's last opportunity to play for Notre Dame at home , Devine put him into a game as defensive end against Georgia Tech on November 8 , 1975 .
In the movie Rudy , Devine is given a somewhat antagonistic role , not wanting Ruettiger to dress for his last game .
In the real life scenario , however , it was Devine who came up with the idea to dress Ruettiger .
In the final play of Ruettiger 's senior season with the Fighting Irish , he recorded a sack , which is all his Notre Dame stat line has ever shown .
Ruettiger actually played for three plays .
The first play was a kickoff , the second play was an incomplete pass , and on the third ( and final ) play he sacked Georgia Tech quarterback Rudy Allen .
Ruettiger was carried off the field by his teammates following the game .
Ruettiger was one of two players in Notre Dame history to ever be carried off the field by his teammates .
The other is Marc Edwards in 1995 .

Ruettiger came out of the tunnel at Notre Dame Stadium to a loud ovation .
Notre Dame ultimately lost the game ( though that loss was later vacated due to misconduct by USC ) .
