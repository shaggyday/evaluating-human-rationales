CRICKET
AT
THE 1998 COMMONWEALTH GAMES Cricket was included in the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Malaysia .
This is the only time cricket was played at a Commonwealth Games .
Matches were played over 50 overs , and had List A status rather than full One Day Internationals .
As is normal at the Commonwealth Games , the Caribbean islands that entered participated as separate nations , not as the combined West Indies team .
Indeed , the Games were the first occasion on which an Antigua and Barbuda side competed at a senior level .
Northern Ireland also entered , this occurrence being noteworthy because Irish cricket is usually represented by an all - island Irish cricket team .
Sixteen teams entered the competition , including seven of the nine then Test - playing nations : West Indies did not enter as mentioned above , while England declined to send a team at all , on the grounds that the September date chosen clashed with other fixtures such as the end of the County Championship .
The strength of the teams that were entered varied somewhat .
Strong squads including seasoned Test and ODI players were fielded by the three nations that eventually won medals : Bronze medalists New Zealand with Stephen Fleming and Daniel Vettori , silver medalists Australia with Steve and Mark Waugh , Adam Gilchrist , Ricky Ponting , Damien Fleming and Darren Lehmann and gold medalists South Africa with Shaun Pollock , Jacques Kallis , Makhaya Ntini , Mark Boucher , and Herschelle Gibbs .
India and Pakistan sent weakened teams as a result of a clash with the 1998 Sahara Cup , although India still named Sachin Tendulkar , Anil Kumble , Harbhajan Singh and VVS Laxman in its Commonwealth team while Pakistan included Shoaib Akhtar .
Other notable cricketers who took part in the Commonwealth tournament included Sri Lanka 's Mahela Jayawardene , Zimbabwe 's Andy Flower and the West Indies ' Curtly Ambrose and Richie Richardson , playing for their home country of Antigua and Barbuda under the Commonwealth format .
COMPETITION FORMAT Section::::Competition format .
All matches were played at one of six grounds in Kuala Lumpur .
The 16 teams were divided into four groups of four on a seeded basis .
Each team played the other three once in matches , with this round robin restricted to a single week between 9 September and 15 September .
Teams scored two points for a win , one for a no - result , and none for a loss .
The top team in each group went forward to the knock - out stages of semi - finals and final ( plus a third - place play - off ) .
Teams with equal numbers of points were separated on net run rate , but in the event this rule was only needed to decide the minor placings .

Craig Wright GROUP STAGES GROUP
A Section::::Group stages .
Section::::Group A.
Sri Lanka won all three of their games to qualify for the semi - finals .
A straightforward seven - wicket victory over Malaysia ( who collapsed from 87/3 to 109 all out ; Sri Lanka reached 112/3 ) was followed by a 67-run win over Jamaica with Gunawardene hitting 107 ( Sri Lanka 211/5 ; Jamaica 144/8 ) , before a decider against Zimbabwe .
The Africans reached 265/7 ( Campbell 82 , Goodwin 55 ) ; in reply , Sri Lanka stumbled to 110/5 before Hathurusingha ( 60 ) and de Saram ( 75 * )
brought them close to victory at 258/6 .
Streak then took three quick wickets , but the last pair survived to give Sri Lanka a one - wicket win .
In the other Group A games , Zimbabwe ( 144/4 ) beat Jamaica ( 142 all out ) by six wickets , with an unbeaten 55 from Evans .
Zimbabwe then scored 309/9
( Flower 70 , Evans 59 , Goodwin 53 ) as they crushed Malaysia ( 88 all out ; Nkala 3–6 ) by 221 runs .
The wooden spoon game saw Malaysia crumble to 83 all out thanks to 4–13 from Cunningham , losing by six wickets to Jamaica ( 87/4 ) .
GROUP B Section::::Group B. Australia scored three wins out of three in this group .
First came a nine wicket win over Canada who scored only 60 all out ( Fleming 4–17 ) ; the Australians made 61/1 in 14 overs .
In their second match , Antigua and Barbuda were dismissed for 99 ; Australia made 101/3 in reply .
Finally , against India , Australia scored a total of 255/5 , followed by India who stuttered to 109 all out .
Antigua and Barbuda scored 164/9 ( a recovery from 77/7 ) in a 41-over match against India , but rain fell with India 30/2 in reply and the match was declared a no - result .
India 's Khurasiya scored 83 against Canada in a total of 157/9 , with Kumble then claiming 4–11 as the Canadians were dismissed for 45 .
Antigua and Barbuda ( 256/7 ) beat Canada ( 135 all out ) , with Lake making 54 before retiring hurt and then taking 4–17 ; Walsh also made 51 for the Antiguans .
GROUP
C Section::::Group C. Honours in this group went to South Africa , who started off against Northern Ireland .
The Irish had reached 89/5 from 38.1 overs when it rained , and the Duckworth – Lewis method was used to calculate a target of 131 from 38 overs for the South Africans , who won by making 133/6 .
South Africa then bowled out Bangladesh for 79 and made 80/5 for a five - wicket victory .
In South Africa 's final match , Barbados set 254/6 ( Wallace 74 ) , but 71 from Kallis and 54 from Gibbs saw their opponents make 257/6 with ten balls remaining .
Barbados ( 160/6 in 41.3 overs ) beat Bangladesh ( 144/7 in 47 overs , Shahriar Hossain 70 * ) under the Duckworth – Lewis method , and then beat Northern Ireland by 176 runs .
Scores of 92 from Wallace , 66 from Griffith and 60 from Campbell contributed to a score of 296/5 , which the Irish never got anywhere near despite Smyth 's 58 , scoring just 120/7 .
However , Northern Ireland came back well to beat Bangladesh by 114 runs
: the Irish made 177 ( McCallan 53 ) before Cooke took 5–35 , as Bangladesh were dismissed for 63 .
GROUP
D Section::::Group D.
One - day specialists New Zealand won all their matches in Group D , beginning with a comfortable five - wicket win over Kenya ( Kenya 144/8 ; New Zealand 145/5 ) before an even more straightforward success against Scotland .
The New Zealanders amassed 278/6 ( Fleming 102 , Parore 87 ) , then Harris took 4–25 as Scotland could manage only 101 all out .
Finally the Kiwis won the crunch match against Pakistan by 81 runs : New Zealand 's 215/8 was boosted by 66 from Fleming despite Shoaib Akhtar 's 4–47 , but only three Pakistanis ( and Extras ) reached double figures as they lost their last six wickets for 21 runs , being bowled out for 134 to slide to an 81-run defeat .
Pakistan had earlier been frustrated by rain against Scotland ; they had scored 201/5 from their 50 overs ( Akhtar Sarfraz 66 * ) and had reduced the Scots to 31/3 when the weather intervened .
The Pakistanis did beat Kenya , however : Odoyo 's 4–39 had restricted them to 189/8 , but Arshad Khan 's 4–14 and Javed Qadeer 's five catches behind the stumps helped Pakistan to a 129-run win as they dismissed the Africans for only 60 .
Odumbe took 5–38 as Kenya kept Scotland down to 156/8 ; they then made 157/5 to win with 12.3 overs in hand .

SOUTH AFRICA
V SRI LANKA Section::::Knockout stage ( Medal round ) .
Section::::Semi - finals .
Section::::South Africa v Sri Lanka .
A low - scoring game produced a thrilling climax .
Gunawardene 's 53 held the Sri Lankan innings together after they had been put in to bat by the South Africans , but Boje 's 4–16 kept the Sri Lankans ' score down to a distinctly unimpressive 130 as they were bowled out in 44 overs .
In reply , South Africa lost wickets at regular intervals , with the highest score being opener Rindel 's 25 .
At 96/9 all looked lost , but then Boje ( 20 * ) and Dawson ( 15 * ) compiled an unbroken stand of 35 for the last wicket to lead their team to 131/9 and a one - wicket victory .
AUSTRALIA V NEW ZEALAND Section::::Australia
v New Zealand .
A totally one - sided trans
- Tasman clash saw New Zealand collapse to a feeble 58 all out after being sent in , with only captain Fleming reaching 20 .
Australian slow left - armer Brad Young took a hat - trick to finish with an exceptional analysis of 4–2–4–4 .
In reply , the Australians rattled along at nearly six an over , losing only Mark Waugh as they raced to 62/1 in 10.5 overs with Gilchrist smashing three sixes as he hit 42 from 36 balls .
BRONZE
MEDAL MATCH Section::::Bronze Medal Match .
New Zealand recovered from the trauma of their semi - final thrashing to beat Sri Lanka by 51 runs .
56 not out from Harris and 56 from Astle were the main elements of a final total of 212/7 that included three run - outs .
The Sri Lankans struggled to 77/7 in their innings , and though they added 53 for the eighth wicket thanks to Perera 's 45 , it was never likely to be enough
and they were bowled out for 161 .
GOLD MEDAL MATCH Section::::Gold Medal Match .
Put in by South Africa after losing the toss , the Australians were indebted to captain Steve Waugh 's unbeaten 90 as they recovered from 58/4 to post a still below - par 183 all out .
Opposing captain Pollock was the chief destroyer for South Africa , with 4–19 from nine tight overs to remove Mark Waugh , Ponting , Gilchrist and Lehmann .
South Africa got off to a good start in their reply with an opening partnership of 73 between Rindel ( 67 ) and Hudson ( 36 ) .
A burst of wickets from Lehmann ( 3–14 ) saw the South Africans wobble as they fell from 158/2 to 183/6 , but the Proteas did not lose another wicket and Kallis ' watchful 44 from
96 balls saw South Africa through to 184/6 and the gold medal with four overs to spare .

Gold medal - winning South African captain Pollock praised the Commonwealth experience while recalling his time at the Games for Cricinfo .
The success of the IPL , is leading to a T20 tournament in the Commonwealth Games being considered .
The president of the Commonwealth Games federation wants to bring cricket back into the games , and the Glasgow bid for the 2014 games had indicated that they would include cricket , but it did not materialise .
It is known , however , that the inclusion will occur no sooner than 2022 after the ICC rejected an offer for cricket to feature in the 2018 games on the Gold Coast .
