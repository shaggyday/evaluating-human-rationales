FAMILY GUY Family Guy is an American animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company .
The series centers on the Griffins , a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois ; their children , Meg , Chris , and Stewie ; and their anthropomorphic pet dog , Brian .
The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog , Rhode Island , and exhibits much of its humor in the form of metafictional cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture .
The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films , The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve .
MacFarlane redesigned the films ' protagonist , Larry , and his dog , Steve , and renamed them Peter and Brian , respectively .
MacFarlane pitched a seven - minute pilot to Fox in 1998 , and the show was greenlit and began production .
Shortly after the third season of Family Guy had aired in 2002 , Fox canceled the series with one episode left unaired .
Adult Swim aired that episode in 2003 , finishing the series ' original run .
However , favorable DVD sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004 for a fourth season , which began airing on May 1 , 2005 .
Since its debut on January 31 , 1999 , episodes of Family Guy have been broadcast .
Its seventeenth season began on September 30 , 2018 .
Family Guy has been nominated for 12 Primetime Emmy Awards and 11 Annie Awards , and has won three of each .
In 2009 , it was nominated for an Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series , the first time an animated series was nominated for the award since The Flintstones in 1961 .

Section::::Characters .
The show revolves around the adventures of the Griffin family , consisting of father Peter Griffin , a bumbling yet well - intentioned blue - collar worker ; Lois , a pretty stay - at - home mother and piano teacher who is a member of the wealthy Pewterschmidt family ; Meg , their often - bullied teenage daughter who is also constantly ridiculed or ignored by the family ; Chris , their awkward teenage son , who is overweight , unintelligent and , in many respects , is simply a younger version of his father ; and Stewie , their diabolical infant son of ambiguous sexual orientation who has adult mannerisms and uses stereotypical archvillain phrases .

Blaccu - Weather meteorologist Ollie Williams also make frequent appearances .

SETTING
Section::::Setting .
The primary setting of Family Guy is Quahog ( [ pron .
ko - hog or kwo - hog ] ) , a fictional district of Providence , Rhode Island that was founded by Peter 's ancestor , Griffin Peterson .
MacFarlane resided in Providence during his time as a student at Rhode Island School of Design , and the show contains distinct Rhode Island landmarks similar to real - world locations .
MacFarlane often borrows the names of Rhode Island locations and icons such as Pawtucket and Buddy Cianci for use in the show .
MacFarlane , in an interview with a news program on WNAC - TV , Channel 64 in Providence , stated that the town is modeled after Cranston , Rhode Island .
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Development .
MacFarlane initially conceived Family Guy in 1995 while studying animation at the Rhode Island School of Design ( RISD ) .
During college , he created his thesis film entitled The Life of Larry , which was submitted by his professor at RISD to Hanna - Barbera .
MacFarlane was hired by the company .
In 1996 MacFarlane created a sequel to The Life of Larry entitled Larry and Steve , which featured a middle - aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog , Steve ; the short was broadcast in 1997 as one of Cartoon Network 's World Premiere Toons .
Executives at Fox saw the Larry shorts and contracted MacFarlane to create a series , entitled Family Guy , based on the characters .
Fox proposed MacFarlane complete a 15-minute short , and gave him a budget of $ 50,000 .
Several aspects of Family Guy were inspired by the Larry shorts .
While he worked on the series , the characters of Larry and his dog Steve slowly evolved into Peter and Brian .
MacFarlane stated that the difference between The Life of Larry and Family Guy was that " Life of Larry was shown primarily in my dorm room and Family Guy was shown after the Super Bowl . "
After the pilot aired , the series was given the green light .
MacFarlane drew inspiration from several sitcoms such as The Simpsons and All in the Family .
Premises were drawn from several 1980s Saturday morning cartoons he watched as a child , such as The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang and Rubik , the Amazing Cube .
The Griffin family first appeared on the demo that MacFarlane pitched to Fox on May 15 , 1998 .
Family Guy was originally planned to start out as short movies for the sketch show MADtv , but the plan changed because MADtv 's budget was not large enough to support animation production .
MacFarlane noted that he then wanted to pitch it to Fox , as he thought that that was the place to create a prime - time animation show .
Family Guy was originally pitched to Fox in the same year as King of the Hill , but the show was not bought until years later , when King of the Hill became successful .
Fox ordered 13 episodes of Family Guy to air in midseason after MacFarlane impressed executives with a seven - minute demo .
EPISODES PRODUCTION EXECUTIVE PRODUCERS Section::::Production .
Section::::Executive producers .
MacFarlane has served as an executive producer during the show 's entire history .
The first executive producers were David Zuckerman , Lolee Aries , David Pritchard , and Mike Wolf .
Family Guy has had many executive producers in its history , including Daniel Palladino , Kara Vallow , and Danny Smith .
David A. Goodman joined the show as a co - executive producer in season three , and eventually became an executive producer .
Alex Borstein , who voices Lois , worked as an executive and supervising producer for the fourth and fifth seasons .
WRITING Section::::Writing .
The first team of writers assembled for the show consisted of Chris Sheridan , Danny Smith , Gary Janetti , Ricky Blitt , Neil Goldman , Garrett Donovan , Matt Weitzman , and Mike Barker .
The writing process of Family Guy generally starts with 14 writers that take turns writing the scripts ; when a script is finished it is given to the rest of the writers to read .
These scripts generally include cutaway gags .
Various gags are pitched to MacFarlane and the rest of the staff , and those deemed funniest are included in the episode .
MacFarlane has explained that normally it takes 10 months to produce an episode because the show uses hand - drawn animation .
The show rarely comments on current events for this reason .
The show 's initial writers had never written for an animated show ; and most came from live - action sitcoms .
MacFarlane explains that he is a fan of 1930s and 1940s radio programs , particularly the radio thriller anthology " Suspense " , which led him to give early episodes ominous titles like " Death Has a Shadow " and " Mind Over Murder " .
MacFarlane explained that the team dropped the naming convention after individual episodes became hard to identify , and the novelty wore off .
For the first few months of production , the writers shared one office , lent to them by the King of the Hill production crew .
Credited with 19 episodes , Steve Callaghan is the most prolific writer on Family Guy staff .
Many of the writers that have left the show have gone on to create or produce other successful series .
Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan co - wrote 13 episodes for the NBC sitcom Scrubs during their eight - year run on the show , while also serving as co - producers and working their way up to executive producers .
Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman left the show and went on to create the long - running and still ongoing adult animated series American Dad !
MacFarlane is also a co - creator of American Dad !
On November 4 , 2013 , it was announced that Barker had departed American Dad !
during its run as well , after 10 seasons of serving as producer and co - showrunner over the series .
During the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike , official production of the show halted for most of December 2007 and for various periods afterward .
Fox continued producing episodes without MacFarlane 's final approval , which he termed " a colossal dick move " in an interview with Variety .
Though MacFarlane refused to work on the show , his contract under Fox required him to contribute to any episodes it would subsequently produce .
Production officially resumed after the end of the strike , with regularly airing episodes recommencing on February 17 , 2008 .
According to MacFarlane , in 2009 , it costs about $ 2 million to make an episode of Family Guy .
During his September 2017 AMA on Reddit , MacFarlane revealed that he had n't written for the show since 2010 , focusing instead on production and voice acting .
EARLY HISTORY AND CANCELLATION
Section::::Early history and cancellation .
Family Guy officially premiered after Fox 's broadcast of Super Bowl XXXIII on January 31 , 1999 , with " Death Has a Shadow " .
The show debuted to 22 million viewers , and immediately generated controversy regarding its adult content .
The show returned on April 11 , 1999 , with " I Never Met the Dead Man " .
Family Guy garnered decent ratings in Fox 's 8:30 pm slot on Sunday , scheduled between The Simpsons and The X - Files .
At the end of its first season , the show ranked at # 33 in the Nielsen ratings , with 12.8 million households tuning in .
The show launched its second season in a new time slot , Thursday at 9 pm , on September 23 , 1999 .
Family Guy was pitted against NBC 's Frasier , and the series ' ratings declined sharply .
Subsequently , Fox removed Family Guy from its schedule , and began airing episodes irregularly .
The show returned on March 7 , 2000 , at 8:30 pm on Tuesdays , where it was constantly beaten in the ratings by ABC 's then - new breakout hit Who Wants to Be a Millionaire , coming in at # 114 in the Nielsen ratings with 6.32 million households tuning in .
Fox announced that the show had been canceled in May 2000 , at the end of the second season .
However , following a last - minute reprieve , on July 24 , 2000 , Fox ordered 13 additional episodes of Family Guy to form a third season .
The show returned November 8 , 2001 , once again in a tough time slot : Thursday nights at 8:00 pm ET ; this slot brought it into competition with Survivor and Friends ( a situation that was later referenced in ) .
During its second and third seasons , Fox frequently moved the show around to different days and time slots with little or no notice and , consequently , the show 's ratings suffered .
Upon Fox 's annual unveiling of its 2002 fall line - up on May 15 , 2002 , Family Guy was absent .
Fox announced that the show had been officially canceled shortly thereafter .
CULT SUCCESS AND
REVIVAL Section::::Cult success and revival .
Fox attempted to sell the rights for reruns of the show , but finding networks that were interested was difficult ; Cartoon Network eventually bought the rights , " basically for free " , according to the president of 20th Century Fox Television .
Family Guy premiered in reruns on Adult Swim on April 20 , 2003 , and immediately became the block 's top - rated program , dominating late - night viewing in its time period versus cable and broadcast competition , and boosting viewership by 239 % .
The complete first and second seasons were released on DVD the same week the show premiered on Adult Swim , and the show became a cult phenomenon , selling 400,000 copies within one month .
Sales of the DVD set reached 2.2 million copies , becoming the best - selling television DVD of 2003 and the second - highest - selling television DVD ever , behind the first season of Comedy Central 's Chappelle 's Show .
The third - season DVD release also sold more than a million copies .
The show 's popularity in DVD sales and reruns rekindled Fox 's interest , and , on May 20 , 2004 , Fox ordered 35 new episodes of Family Guy , marking the first revival of a television show based on DVD sales .
" North by North Quahog " , which premiered May 1 , 2005 , was the first episode to be broadcast after the show 's hiatus .
It was written by MacFarlane and directed by Peter Shin .
MacFarlane believed the show 's three - year hiatus was beneficial because animated shows do not normally have hiatuses , and towards the end of their seasons , " ...
you see a lot more sex jokes and bodily function jokes and signs of a fatigued staff that their brains are just fried " .
With " North by North Quahog " , the writing staff tried to keep the show " [ ... ] exactly as it was " before its cancellation , and " None of us had any desire to make it look any slicker " .
The episode was watched by 11.85 million viewers , the show 's highest ratings since the airing of the first season episode " " .
LAWSUITS Section::::Lawsuits .
In March 2007 comedian Carol Burnett filed a $ 6 million lawsuit against 20th Century Fox , claiming that her charwoman cartoon character had been portrayed on the show without her permission .
She stated it was a trademark infringement , and that Fox violated her publicity rights .
On June 4 , 2007 , United States District Judge Dean D. Pregerson rejected the lawsuit , stating that the parody was protected under the First Amendment , citing Hustler Magazine v. Falwell as a precedent .
On October 3 , 2007 , Bourne Co. Music Publishers filed a lawsuit accusing the show of infringing its copyright on the song " When You Wish Upon a Star " , through a parody song entitled " I Need a Jew " appearing in the episode "
When You Wish Upon a Weinstein " .
Bourne Co. , the sole United States copyright owner of the song , alleged the parody pairs a " thinly veiled " copy of its music with antisemitic lyrics .
Named in the suit were 20th Century Fox Film Corp. , Fox Broadcasting Co. , Cartoon Network , MacFarlane and Murphy ; the suit sought to stop the program 's distribution and asked for unspecified damages .
Bourne argued that " I Need a Jew " uses the copyrighted melody of " When You Wish Upon a Star " without commenting on that song , and that it was therefore not a First Amendment - protected parody per the ruling in Campbell v. Acuff - Rose Music ,
Inc. On March 16 , 2009 , United States District Judge Deborah Batts held that Family Guy did not infringe on Bourne 's copyright when it transformed the song for comical use in an episode .
In December 2007 , Family Guy was again accused of copyright infringement when actor Art Metrano filed a lawsuit regarding a scene in , in which Jesus performs Metrano 's signature " magic " act involving absurd " faux " magical hand gestures while humming the distinctive tune " Fine and Dandy " .
20th Century Fox , MacFarlane , Callaghan and Borstein were all named in the suit .
In July 2009 a federal district court judge rejected Fox 's motion to dismiss , saying that the first three fair use factors involved — " purpose and character of the use " , " nature of the infringed work " and " amount and substantiality of the taking " — counted in Metrano 's favor , while the fourth — " economic impact " — had to await more fact - finding .
In denying the dismissal , the court held that the reference in the scene made light of Jesus and his followers — not Metrano or his act .
The case was settled out of court in 2010 with undisclosed terms .
VOICE CAST Section::::Voice cast .
Seth MacFarlane voices three of the show 's main characters : Peter Griffin , Brian Griffin , and Stewie Griffin .
Since MacFarlane had a strong vision for these characters , he chose to voice them himself , believing it would be easier than for someone else to attempt it .
MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from a security guard he overheard talking while attending the Rhode Island School of Design .
Stewie 's voice was based on the voice of English actor Rex Harrison , especially his performance in the 1964 musical drama film My Fair Lady .
MacFarlane uses his regular speaking voice when playing Brian .
MacFarlane also provides the voices for various other recurring and one - time - only characters , most prominently those of the Griffins ' neighbor Glenn Quagmire , news anchor Tom Tucker , and Lois ' father , Carter Pewterschmidt .
Alex Borstein voices Peter 's wife Lois Griffin , Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa , Loretta Brown , and Lois ' mother , Barbara Pewterschmidt .
Borstein was asked to provide a voice for the pilot while she was working on MADtv .
She had not met MacFarlane or seen any of his artwork , and said it was " really sight unseen " .
At the time , Borstein was performing in a stage show in Los Angeles .
She played a redheaded mother whose voice she had based on one of her cousins .
Seth Green primarily voices Chris Griffin and Neil Goldman .
Green stated that he did an impression of the character Buffalo Bill from the thriller film The Silence of the Lambs during his audition .
Mila Kunis and Lacey Chabert have both voiced Meg Griffin .
Chabert left the series because of time conflicts with schoolwork and her role on Party of Five .
When Kunis auditioned for the role , she was called back by MacFarlane , who instructed her to speak slower .
He then told her to come back another time and enunciate more .
Once she claimed that she had it under control , MacFarlane hired her .
Mike Henry voices Cleveland Brown , Herbert , Bruce the Performance Artist , Consuela and the Greased - up Deaf Guy .
Henry met MacFarlane at the Rhode Island School of Design , and kept in touch with him after they graduated .
A few years later , MacFarlane contacted him about being part of the show ; he agreed and came on as a writer and voice actor .
During the show 's first four seasons , he was credited as a guest star , but beginning with season five 's " Prick Up Your Ears " , he has been credited as a main cast member .
Other recurring cast members include Patrick Warburton as Joe Swanson ; Jennifer Tilly as Bonnie Swanson ; John G. Brennan as Mort Goldman and Horace the bartender ; Carlos Alazraqui as Jonathan Weed ; Adam Carolla and Norm Macdonald as Death ; Lori Alan as Diane Simmons ; and Phil LaMarr as Ollie Williams and the judge .
Fellow cartoonist Butch Hartman has made guest voice appearances in many episodes as various characters .
Also , writer Danny Smith voices various recurring characters , such as Ernie the Giant Chicken .
Alexandra Breckenridge also appears as many various characters .
Adam West appeared as the eponymous Mayor Adam West , until his death in 2017 .
Episodes often feature guest voices from a wide range of professions , including actors , athletes , authors , bands , musicians , and scientists .
Many guest voices star as themselves .
Leslie Uggams was the first to appear as herself , in the fourth episode of the first season , " Mind Over Murder " .
The episode " Not All Dogs Go to Heaven " guest starred the entire cast of , including Patrick Stewart , Jonathan Frakes , Brent Spiner , LeVar Burton , Gates McFadden , Michael Dorn , Wil Wheaton , Marina Sirtis , and even Denise Crosby ( season 1 as Tasha Yar ) , playing themselves ; this is the episode with the most guest stars of the seventh season .
HALLMARKS " ROAD TO " EPISODES Section::::Hallmarks .
Section::::"Road to " episodes .
The " Road to " episodes are a series of hallmark travel episodes .
They are a parody of the seven Road to ... comedy films starring Bing Crosby and Bob Hope .
These episodes have always involved Stewie and Brian in some foreign , supernatural or science - fiction location , unrelated to the show 's normal location in Quahog .
The first , entitled " Road to Rhode Island " , aired on May 30 , 2000 , during the second season .
The episodes are known for featuring elaborate musical numbers , similar to the Road films .
The episodes contain several trademarks , including a special version of the opening sequence , custom musical cues and musical numbers , and parodies of science fiction and fantasy films .
The original idea for the " Road to " episodes came from MacFarlane , as he is a fan of the films of Crosby , Hope and Lamour .
The first episode was directed by Dan Povenmire , who would direct the rest of the " Road to " episodes until the episode " Road to Rupert " , at which point he had left the show to create Phineas and Ferb .
Series regular Greg Colton then took over Povenmire 's role as director of the " Road to " episodes .
The " Road to " episodes are generally considered by critics and fans to be some of the greatest in the series , thanks to the developing relationship between Stewie and Brian , and the strong plotlines of the episodes themselves .
HUMOR
Section::::Humor .
Family Guy uses the filmmaking technique of cutaways , which occur in the majority of Family Guy episodes .
Emphasis is often placed on gags which make reference to current events and/or modern cultural icons .
Early episodes based much of their comedy on Stewie 's " super villain " antics , such as his constant plans for total world domination , his evil experiments , plans and inventions to get rid of things he dislikes , and his constant attempts at matricide .
As the series progressed , the writers and MacFarlane agreed that his personality and the jokes were starting to feel dated , so they began writing him with a different personality .
Family Guy often includes self - referential humor .
The most common form is jokes about Fox Broadcasting , and occasions where the characters break the fourth wall by addressing the audience .
For example , in " North by North Quahog " , the first episode that aired after the show 's revival , included Peter telling the family that they had been canceled because Fox had to make room in their schedule for shows like Dark Angel , Titus , Undeclared , Action ,
That ' 80s Show , Wonderfalls , Fastlane , Andy Richter Controls the Universe , Skin , Girls Club , Cracking Up , The Pitts , Firefly , Get Real , Freakylinks , Wanda at Large , Costello , The Lone Gunmen , A Minute with Stan Hooper , Normal , Ohio , Pasadena , Harsh Realm , Keen Eddie , The $ treet , The American Embassy , Cedric the Entertainer Presents , The Tick , Luis , and Greg the Bunny .
Lois asks whether there is any hope , to which Peter replies that if all these shows are canceled they might have a chance ; the shows were indeed canceled during Family Guys hiatus .
The show uses catchphrases , and most of the primary and secondary characters have them .
Notable expressions include Quagmire 's " Giggity giggity goo " , Peter 's " Freakin ' sweet " , Cleveland 's " Oh , that 's nasty " , and Joe 's " Bring it on ! "
The use of many of these catchphrases declined in later seasons .
The episode " Big Man on Hippocampus " mocks catchphrase - based humor : when Peter , who has forgotten everything about his life , is introduced to Meg , he exclaims " D'oh ! " , to which Lois replies , " No , Peter , that 's not your catchphrase . "
RECEPTION AND LEGACY Section::::Reception and legacy .
In 2016 , a The New York Times study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that like other satirical comedies , Family Guy " is most popular in cities .
The show 's popularity was more correlated with support for Hillary Clinton than any other show " .
As of 2008 , the franchise has generated in total revenue , including from TV syndication , from DVD sales , and from merchandise sales .
