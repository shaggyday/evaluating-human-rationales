ADMISSION TO PRACTICE LAW
An admission to practice law is acquired when a lawyer receives a license to practice law .
In jurisdictions with two types of lawyer , as with barristers and solicitors , barristers must gain admission to the bar whereas for solicitors there are distinct practising certificates .
Becoming a lawyer is a widely varied process around the world .
Common to all jurisdictions are requirements of age and competence ; some jurisdictions also require documentation of citizenship or immigration status .
However , the most varied requirements are those surrounding the preparation for the license , whether it includes obtaining a law degree , passing an exam , or serving in an apprenticeship .
In English , admission is also called a law license .
Basic requirements vary from country to country , as described below .
In some jurisdictions , after admission the lawyer needs to maintain a current practising certificate to be permitted to offer services to the public .
AFRICA Section::::Africa .
The African Union comprises all 55 countries on the Continent of Africa .
It is probably best to seek out each specific nation for its qualifications as each can vary widely between them .
So long as you hold a legal education , often it is straightforward .
However , most often the biggest obstacle is residency for foreign educated lawyers .
EGYPT NAMIBIA Section::::Namibia .
Namibia has a detailed act that fully delineates the requisites to be a Legal Practitioner .
Generally , citizenship or extensive residency is required .
NIGER NIGERIA KENYA Section::::Kenya .
Legal practice in Kenya is governed by the Advocates Act , Chapter 16 of the Laws of Kenya .
Only lawyers admitted to the Bar , known as Advocates of the High Court of Kenya , have the right of audience before Kenyan courts .
To be an advocate , ( which is concurrent with being a member of the Law Society of Kenya )
one must first complete a law degree from a recognised university in the Commonwealth , then attend the Kenya School of Law for a postgraduate Diploma in Legal Practice for training in more practical legal subjects such as conveyancing and evidence , and complete a mandatory six - month articles of pupillage under a lawyer of five years ' standing .
Upon completion of the requisite academic and practical training , one must ' petition ' the chief justice of the judiciary for admission to the bar by filing the requisite documents , including the petition in a prescribed format under the Advocates Act and an accompanying affidavit , a certificate of completion of pupillage and two certificates of moral fitness by practising lawyers of five years ' standing , one of which must be from the petitioner 's supervisor in chambers ( referred to as ' pupil master ' ) , and pay a fee .
The petition is addressed to both the registrar of the High Court on behalf of the chief justice and the secretary / CEO of the Law Society of Kenya , and upon approval by the Council of the Law Society , one is ' called to the bar ' .
The call is made in open court by taking an oath before the chief justice , who pronounces the admission .
Usually , several lawyers are admitted to the bar at the same session .
To maintain eligibility to practice before courts , one must pay an annual fee for a ' practising certificate ' to the Law Society of Kenya , although the certificate is issued by the Court Registrar .
Non - payment renders one ineligible to appear before courts .
Lawyers who do not wish to appear before courts need not take out a certificate , but in practice most lawyers do so as it is generally required by most employers hiring the services of a lawyer , since only advocates can sign any documents in such capacity .
Advocates who wish to administer oaths — usually in affidavit format — must apply to the Chief Justice to be appointed Commissioners for Oaths , whereas those who wish to perform functions similar to notaries public in the United Kingdom must have been advocates for five years , and formally apply to be a notary public to the Chief Justice through the Court Registrar .
To appear before the Supreme Court , one must be an advocate of seven years ' standing .

SCOTLAND
Section::::Scotland .
In Scotland , a lawyer normally studies for an LL.B. in Scots law ; as an undergraduate first degree this takes three years for an ordinary degree or four years as an honours degree .
The LL.B. can be taken as a graduate entry degree which takes two years .
The process of admission to practice law then depends on whether a lawyer wishes to become a solicitor or an advocate .
Admission to practice as a solicitor is regulated by the Law Society of Scotland , with solicitors having to study for a one - year Diploma in Professional Legal Practice and then complete a traineeship in a law firm .
Solicitors have rights of audience before the sheriff courts and justice of the peace courts .
Admission to practice as an advocate , having rights of audience before the Court of Session and the High Court of Justiciary , is regulated by the Faculty of Advocates .
The Faculty of Advocates exercises this authority under the Act of Sederunt ( Regulation of Advocates ) 2011 , which delegates the responsibility from the Court of Session .
An Act of Sederunt is a form of subordinate legislation passed by the Court of Session , and the powers to regulate admission to practice as an advocate is set by Section 120 of the Legal Services ( Scotland ) Act 2010 , which states : Prospective advocates ( called devils or intrants ) will complete a period of training in a solicitor 's office , a period of devilling , and then must pass an assessment under the Faculty 's Scheme of Assessment for Devils .
The Faculty publishes detailed regulations as required by the Act of Sederunt , which lay out all of the requirements for prospective Advocates .

UNITED STATES Section::::United States .
Regulation of the legal profession is a power reserved to the states pursuant to the Tenth Amendment to the US Constitution .
Each state , territory and the District of Columbia has its own rules .
Unlike many other countries , US jurisdictions do not license legal practitioners as solicitors and barristers , but all licensed attorneys are qualified to practice as both .
All jurisdictions require applicants to pass a moral character evaluation and to pass an ethics examination , which some states administer as part of their bar examinations .
Most require applicants to achieve a particular score on the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination .
All jurisdictions except Wisconsin and New Hampshire require successful completion of a bar exam for admission .
Diploma privilege is available in those states for graduates of certain law schools whose degree programmes meet certain requirements .
Educational requirements vary but most states require a baccalaureate degree ( with any major concentration , or in general studies ) , followed by a professional doctorate in law - specifically a Juris Doctor or Doctor of Jurisprudence degree from a law school accredited by the American Bar Association .
Some states , such as New York , permit persons with an accredited foreign law degree of comparable duration to join the state bar so long as their education is in the common law .
A very small number of states accept US law degrees from unaccredited law schools .
At least one state , California , requires no general degree and no law degree .
It is technically possible to become an attorney in California by completing two years of college coursework , or the equivalent as demonstrated by examination and to meet the legal education requirement by studying law diligently in a lawyer 's office or judge 's chambers for not less than 864 hours over not less than four years .
Hours spent as an employee of an attorney or judge do not count as " study . "

Very few people pursue these options .
