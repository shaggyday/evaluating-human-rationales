ITCHING POWDER
Itching powder refers to a group of powders or powder - like substances that induce itching when applied onto human skin .
This is usually done as a practical joke or prank to an unsuspecting victim .
The cause of the irritation can be mechanical , such as products containing ground rose hips .
Another common ingredient is Mucuna pruriens , a type of legume that produces seedpods coated with thousands of detachable spicules ( needle - like hairs ) , the spicules contain an enzyme ( mucunain ) that causes severe itching , and they have been sold commercially as itching powder .
Mucuna pruriens has been used to test the efficacy of anti - itch drugs .
The term " itching powder " is colloquial ; there is no one specific source of the powder , though some gag companies do tend to have favourites .
Two very common , accessible , and fairly harmless ( though not entirely â€“ itching powder can be very dangerous when abused ) sources are maple samara and rosehips .
These are used in home recipes popularized by sites that publish how - to guides such as wikiHow and eHow .
For the safety of the maker and of the victim , gloves ( dust mask , and glasses as itching powder is a mouth and eye irritant ) and caution are strongly encouraged whenever handling the processed powder .
Rosehips contain prickly hairs that are used as the active ingredient , whereas the body ( rather than the wing ) of the bigleaf maple samara is covered with spiny hairs that cause skin irritation , and are used to make itching powder .
