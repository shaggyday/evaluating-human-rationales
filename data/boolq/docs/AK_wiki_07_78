FOUR - MINUTE MILE
In the sport of athletics , a four - minute mile means completing a mile run ( 1,760 yards , or 1,609.344 metres ) in less than four minutes .
It was first achieved in 1954 by Roger Bannister in 3:59.4 .
The " four - minute barrier " has since been broken by over 1,400 male athletes , and is now the standard of all male professional middle distance runners .
In the 64 years since , the mile record has been lowered by almost 17 seconds , and currently stands at 3:43.13 .
Running a mile in four minutes translates to a speed of 15 miles per hour ( 24.14 km / h , or 2:29.13 per kilometre , or 14.91 seconds per 100 metres ) .
It also equals 22 feet per second ( 1320 feet per minute ) .
RECORD HOLDERS Section::::Record holders .
Breaking the four - minute barrier was first achieved on 6 May 1954 at Oxford University 's Iffley Road Track , by Englishman Roger Bannister , with the help of fellow - runners Chris Chataway and Chris Brasher as pacemakers .
Two months later , during the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games hosted in Vancouver , B.C. , two competing runners , Australia 's John Landy and Bannister , ran the distance of one mile in under four minutes .
The race 's end is memorialised in a photo , and later a statue , of the two , with Landy looking over his left shoulder , just as Bannister is passing him on the right .
Landy thus lost the race .
The statue was placed in front of the Pacific National Exhibition entrance plaza .
New Zealand 's John Walker , who with a 3:49.4 performance in August 1975 became the first man to run the mile under 3:50 , ran 135 sub - four - minute miles during his career ( during which he was the first person to run over 100 sub - four - minute miles ) , and American Steve Scott has run the most sub - four - minute miles , with 136 .
Algeria 's Noureddine Morceli was the first under 3:45 .
Currently , the mile record is held by Morocco 's Hicham El Guerrouj , who ran a time of 3:43.13 in Rome in 1999 .
In 1964 , America 's Jim Ryun became the first high - school runner to break four minutes for the mile , running 3:59.0 as a junior and a then American record 3:55.3 as a senior in 1965 .
Tim Danielson ( 1966 ) and Marty Liquori ( 1967 ) also came in under four minutes , but Ryun 's high - school record stood until Alan Webb ran 3:53.43 in 2001 .
Ten years later , in 2011 , Lukas Verzbicas became the fifth high - schooler under four minutes .
In 2015 , Matthew Maton and Grant Fisher became the sixth and seventh high - schoolers to break four minutes , both running 3:59.38 about a month apart .
Webb was the first high schooler to run sub-4 indoors , running 3:59.86 in early 2001 .
On 6 February 2016 , Andrew Hunter significantly improved upon Webb 's mark , running 3:58.25 on the same New York Armory track and 3:57.81 two weeks later .
Hunter achieved the 4 minute mile mark outdoors later in the season at the Prefontaine Classic .
At that same meet Michael Slagowski ran his second sub-4 minute of the season .
Reed Brown dipped under the barrier on 1 June 2017 , running the 4th fastest high school mile time ever recorded in a race :
3:59.30 .
Another illustration of the progression of performance in the men 's mile is that , in 1994 , forty years after Bannister 's breaking of the barrier , the Irish runner Eamonn Coghlan became the first man over the age of 40 to run a sub - four - minute mile .
Because Coghlan surpassed the mark indoors and before the IAAF validated indoor performances as being eligible for outdoor records , World Masters Athletics still had not recognised a sub-4-minute - mile performance as a record in the M40 division .
Many elite athletes made the attempts to extend their careers beyond age 40 to challenge that mark .
Over 18 years after Coghlan , that was finally achieved by UK 's Anthony Whiteman , running 3:58.79 on 2 June 2012 .
No woman has yet run a four - minute mile .
, the women 's world record is held by retired Russian Svetlana Masterkova , with a time of 4:12.56 in 1996 .
In 1997 , Daniel Komen of Kenya ran two miles in less than eight minutes , doubling up on Bannister 's accomplishment .
He did it again in February 1998 , falling just 0.3 seconds behind his previous performance of 7:58.61 .
He is still the only individual to accomplish the feat .
The youngest runner to ever run a four - minute mile is Norwegian runner Jakob Ingebrigtsen , who ran 3:58.07 at the Prefontaine Classic in May 2017 , when he was 16 years and 250 days old .
However indoor world champion Yomif Kejelcha of Ethiopia , born August 1st of 1997 , ran 4:57.74 in an indoor 2000 m race on February 28 , 2014 at age 16 years and 212 days .
The run averages to a pace of 3:59.58 per mile for the 1.24-mile race .
POSSIBLE OTHER CLAIMS JAMES PARROTT ( 1770 )
Section::::Possible other claims .
Section::::James Parrott ( 1770 ) .
Some sources ( including Olympic medalist Peter Radford ) contend the first successful four - minute mile was run in London by James Parrott on 9 May 1770 .
Parrott 's route began on Goswell Road , before turning down Old Street , finishing at St Leonard 's , Shoreditch .
Although timing methods -- following the invention of the chronometer by John Harrison – were accurate enough at this time to measure the four minutes correctly , the record is not recognised by modern sporting bodies .
Neal Bascomb notes in The Perfect Mile that " even nineteenth - century historians cast a skeptical eye on the account . "
THE WELLER RUN ( 1796 ) Section::::The Weller Run ( 1796 ) .
Then in 1796 , the Sporting Magazine reported that on 10 October of that year a young man called Weller , one of three brothers , " undertook for a wager of three guineas ( about 5 months ' pay at that time ) to run one mile on the Banbury road , in four minutes , which he performed two seconds within the time . "
In other words , the magazine reports that he ran a mile in three minutes , fifty eight seconds .
By that time , a mile could be routinely measured to within a few inches ; watches , thanks to John Harrison , could measure 4 minutes to within 0.0009 sec ( i.e. gain or lose 10 seconds a month ) , and after about 1750 the mass production of highly accurate watches was well underway .
GLENN CUNNINGHAM ( 1920S )
Section::::Glenn Cunningham ( 1920s ) .
It is also reputed that Glenn Cunningham achieved a four - minute mile in a workout in the 1920s .
In addition to being unsubstantiated , a workout run would not count as a record .

POPULAR CULTURE Section::::In
popular culture .
In 1988 , the ABC and the BBC co - produced The Four Minute Mile , a miniseries dramatisation of the race to the four - minute mile , featuring Richard Huw as Bannister and Nique Needles as John Landy ( who was simultaneously pursuing the milestone ) .
It was written by David Williamson and directed by Jim Goddard .
In 2004 , Neal Bascomb wrote a book entitled The Perfect Mile about Roger Bannister , John Landy , and Wes Santee , portraying their individual attempts to break the four - minute mile and the context of the sport of mile racing .
A second film version ( entitled Four Minutes ) was made in 2005 , starring Jamie Maclachlan as Bannister .
In June 2011 the watch used to time the original event was donated by Jeffrey Archer to a charity auction for Oxford University Athletics Club ; it sold for £ 97,250 .
In July 2016 the BBC broadcast the documentary Bannister : Everest on the Track , The Roger Bannister Story with firsthand interviews from Bannister and various other figures on the first sub-4 minute mile .
