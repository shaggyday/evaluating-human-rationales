Manufactured by Vekoma , the enclosed roller coaster features LSM electromagnetic technology , and the first of two installations opened at Disney World on July 29 , 1999 .
It features recorded music and appearances from Aerosmith .
The second installation opened at Disneyland Paris on March 16 , 2002 , and it is considered the fastest roller coaster in France .
Rock ' n ' Roller Coaster accelerates from 0 to in 2.8 seconds .
Riders experience up to 5 G 's ( for comparison , a rocket launch is only 3 G 's ) and travel through three inversions , which include half - vertical loops , half - corkscrews , and a sea serpent roll .
Both versions of the attraction feature five trains , although only four can run at one time .
It was announced in February 2018 that the Paris version of the ride will close for renovations , and that its theme would be changed to the Iron Man and Avengers franchise .
The Hollywood Studios version will remain unchanged .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Construction on the ride in Florida began in February 1998 , with cast member previews and a soft opening initially held in June 1999 .
The grand opening of the ride took place on July 29 , 1999 , with a special , invitation - only party , with Aerosmith as the guests of honor .
Winners rode to Disney 's Hollywood Studios in stretch limousines and were treated to an all - you - can - eat buffet and bar .
After a special performance by painter Denny Dent , winners got the chance to ride the roller coaster with one of the Aerosmith band members .
At the exit of the ride , outside of the gift shop , there hangs a picture from the special event .
The paintings Denny Dent made of the five band members hang in various employee office locations on Walt Disney World property .
The pre - show has changed from when the attraction first opened .
Currently , band member Joe Perry would ask " Chris " to " grab my black Les Paul . "
A Disney cast member in the pre - show area would then pick up and remove a black guitar signed by Joe Perry from the set .
The script uses the unisex name " Chris " so either a male or female could play the part .
Although not used as often as when the ride first opened , the position is still used from time to time ( generally , if the attraction is overstaffed ) .
The film also includes a roadie saying " Hey Joe , I 'll get it for ya " as a backup , in the event that a cast member is not available for the part .
The Walt Disney Studios Park version of the ride opened on March 16 , 2002 .
In 2007 , the queue was modified to accommodate single riders in addition to FASTPASS .
It was announced at the 2018 D23 Expo in Japan that the Walt Disney Studios Park variation of the ride will be closing for a complete theme change to the Iron Man and Avengers franchise .
RIDE EXPERIENCE QUEUE Section::::Ride experience .
Section::::Queue .
Guests begin the queue by entering through a small and narrow tent , with boxes designed like instrument cases decorating the scene .
The guests then wait in an unshaded , gridded - queue area ( if the queue is long ) , and then proceed to a ramp that takes them back and forth , to curve around the front of the building , behind the giant electric guitar , and into the " G - Force Records " recording studio .
Guests then enter a circular room with a high ceiling decorated with a giant record .
Guests can see posters featuring artists Disney has signed , other miscellaneous and famous bands / singers and even the guests themselves .
These posters are displayed via LCD screens and are able to display a guest 's name to customize the visual as they walk past .
Guests then continue immediately to enter a small room with doors covered in marbles and a small exhibit of recording instruments .
Guests can interact with the marble doors and often do , and if they take the time to look at the exhibit , they will see various funny parts ( i.e. the person who organized and presented the exhibit is named Mike Rofone ) .
Guests are then called by a Cast Member to join other guests ( this is where the Fastpass+ line and Stand - by lines merge ) to enter the studio that Aerosmith is recording in .
Guests wait for the recording to stop , and the automatic doors eventually open .
As guests enter , the song " Walk This Way " plays , except , after the introduction is played , the vocals and guitar cut out , leaving only the bassline and drums ( the guitar occasionally comes back in ) .
Guests see Aerosmith and their engineer ( played by Ken Marino ) recording and wait momentarily , until the band is interrupted by their manager ( played by Illeana Douglas ) .
The manager tells the band that they have a show to get to , and they ca n't stay with the guests any longer .
Steven Tyler expresses discontent with this outcome and suggests to his manager to get the guests to their concert , along with backstage passes .
The manager reluctantly accepts , after a few seconds of persuasion .
After she accepts to give the ride and tickets to the show , the guests see her call her assistant " Sal , " who she tells to get a " stretch " limo .
After a few seconds of thinking , she takes it back and instead asks for a " super stretch .
" She then tells the guests that she has gotten a " really fast car " for them to ride to the concert because the show is all the way across town .
Guests then see the limo with the band in it already peel out of the lot , leaving the manager behind .
The automatic doors open to the outdoor parking garage , where guests will be boarding their limos .
As the doors open , the audio for " Walk This Way " plays as guests exit .
Guests walk along a fence that separates them from the limos .
Immediately after entering the garage , guests see the limos that are ready to be launched off from 0 to 57 MPH in 2.8 seconds .
As cars launch off , guests hear echoed and intense screaming , and extra added sound effects .
Guests then proceed from here through a short line to board their limo .
RIDE Section::::Ride .
While the guests wait for the ride to begin , a radio DJ presents the safety spiel , followed by a traffic report .
The highway sign flashes humorous messages like : " Traffic bug you ?
Then STEP on it ! "
Guests wait for the car ahead of them to finish the ride , and eventually they hear an introduction ( which varies , and includes messages such as " We 're only just getting started ! " or " Hold on , here we go ! " ) .
After this introduction , Steven Tyler alternates between each ear the countdown of " Five , four , three , two " , as they hear the introduction of the song they 're about to hear .
As Tyler 's countdown skips , launching on ' 1 ' instead of ' 0 ' , guests suddenly begin to accelerate from 0 to in less than 2.8 seconds .
During this initial second , the on - ride camera takes the photo of the guests .
After a long straightway , the car proceeds to do a Roll Over ( sea serpent ) roll , which is a two inversion element , and then some less intense maneuvers .
During the ride , there are neon signs on the side of the track , designed to mimic road signs .
The car continues along the track , until it reaches the third and final inversion , a corkscrew .
Finally , guests perform a humpback as they enter the " VIP parking " section for the fictitious concert .
Guests wait in a tunnel at a stop for a moment , then proceed to the VIP backstage area , where they 're greeted by a red carpet and monitors displaying their ride photos .
Guests then exit through the gift shop .
