PLOT Section::::Plot .
The film 's young protagonists , Jean Louise " Scout " Finch ( Mary Badham ) and her brother Jeremy Atticus " Jem " Finch ( Phillip Alford ) , live in the fictional town of Maycomb , Alabama , during the early 1930s .
The story covers three years , during which Scout and Jem undergo changes in their lives .
They are innocent children , spending their days happily playing games with each other and spying on Arthur " Boo " Radley ( Robert Duvall ) who has not left his home for many years and about whom many rumors circulate .
Their widowed father , Atticus ( Gregory Peck ) , is a town lawyer and has strong beliefs that all people are to be treated fairly , to turn the other cheek , and to stand for what you believe .
He also allows his children to call him by his first name .
Early in the film , the children see their father accept hickory nuts , and other produce , from Mr. Cunningham ( Crahan Denton ) for legal work because the client has no money .
Through their father 's work as a lawyer , Scout and Jem begin to learn of the racism and evil in their town , aggravated by poverty ; they mature quickly as they are exposed to it .
The local judge ( Paul Fix ) appoints Atticus to defend a black man , Tom Robinson ( Brock Peters ) , against an accusation of rape of a white girl , Mayella Ewell ( Collin Wilcox ) .
Atticus accepts the case .
Jem and Scout experience schoolyard taunts for their father 's decision .
Later , as Atticus is sitting in front of the local jail to safeguard Robinson , a lynch mob arrives , which includes Mr. Cunningham .
Scout , Jem and their friend , Dill ( John Megna ) , interrupt the confrontation .
Scout , unaware of the mob 's purpose , recognizes Cunningham as the man who paid her father in hickory nuts and tells him to say hello to his son , who is her schoolmate .
Cunningham becomes embarrassed and the mob disperses .
At the trial , it is undisputed that Tom came to Mayella 's home at her request to help with the chopping up of a chifforobe , and that Mayella showed signs of having been beaten around that time .
Among Atticus ' chief arguments is that Tom has a crippled left arm , yet the supposed rapist would have had to make extensive use of his left hand in assaulting Mayella before raping her .
Atticus then points out that Mayella 's father , Bob Ewell ( James Anderson ) , is left handed , implying that he – rather than Tom – was the one who beat Mayella .
Atticus also states that the girl had not been examined by a doctor to check for signs of rape after the supposed assault .
In his closing argument Atticus asks the all - white male jury to cast aside their prejudices and instead focus on Tom 's obvious innocence .
In taking the stand in his own defense , Tom denies he attacked Mayella , but states she kissed him .
He testifies he voluntarily assisted Mayella because " I felt sorry for her because … " .
Although Tom does not finish his sentence , the prosecutor ( William Windom ) hammers home the point that he was a black man feeling sorry for a white woman .
In a town where whites are viewed as superior to blacks , Tom 's sympathy for Mayella dooms his case , and he is found guilty .
As Atticus leaves the courtroom , the black spectators in the balcony rise to their feet as a sign of respect and appreciation .
Reverend Sykes says to Scout , " Miss Jean Louise , stand up .
Your father 's passing . "
When Atticus arrives home , Sheriff Heck Tate ( Frank Overton ) tells him that Tom has been killed by a deputy during his transfer to prison .
According to this deputy , Tom was trying to escape , " running like a crazy man " before he was shot .
Atticus and Jem go to the Robinson family home to inform them of Tom 's death .
Bob Ewell , Mayella 's father , appears and spits in Atticus ' face while Jem waits in the car .
Atticus wipes his face and leaves .
Autumn arrives , and Scout and Jem attend a nighttime Halloween pageant at their school .
Scout wears a large hard - shelled ham costume , portraying one of Maycomb county 's products .
At some point during the pageant , Scout 's dress and shoes are misplaced .
She is forced to walk home without shoes , wearing her ham costume .
While cutting through the woods , Scout and Jem are attacked by an unidentified man who has been following them .
Scout 's costume , like an awkward suit of armor , protects her from the attack but restricts her movement and severely restricts her vision .
Jem is knocked unconscious and Scout escapes unharmed in a brief but violent struggle .
Their attacker is thwarted and overcome by another unidentified man .
Scout escapes her costume in time to see the second man carrying Jem to their home .
Scout follows the stranger inside and runs into the arms of a concerned Atticus .
Doc Reynolds comes over and treats the broken arm of an unconscious Jem .
When Sheriff Tate asks Scout what happened , she sees a man standing quietly in the corner behind the door of Jem 's room .
Atticus formally introduces Scout to Arthur Radley , whom she has known as Boo , the man who came to the aid of Jem and Scout in the woods .
It is revealed that Boo had overpowered Bob Ewell before carrying Jem home .
The sheriff reports that Ewell was discovered dead at the scene of the attack with a knife in his ribs .
Atticus assumes that Jem killed Ewell in self - defense .
Sheriff Tate , however , believes that Boo killed Ewell in defense of the children , and he tells Atticus that to drag the shy and reserved Boo into the spotlight for his heroism would be " a sin " .
To protect Boo , Sheriff Tate suggests that Ewell " fell on his knife " .
Scout draws a startlingly precocious analogy , likening unwelcome public attention to Boo to the killing of a mockingbird .

PRODUCTION
Section::::Production .
The producers had wanted to use Harper Lee 's hometown of Monroeville , Alabama for the set .
Harper Lee used her experiences as a child in Monroeville as the basis for the fictional town of Maycomb , so it seemed that would be the best place .
However , the town had changed significantly between the 1920s and the early 1960s
so they made the backlot in Hollywood instead .
The Old Monroe County Courthouse in Monroeville was used as a model for the film set since they could not use the courthouse due to the poor audio quality in the courthouse .
The accuracy of the recreated courthouse in Hollywood led many Alabamians to believe that the film was shot in Monroeville .
The Old Courthouse in Monroe County is now a theater for many plays inspired by To Kill a Mockingbird as well as a museum dedicated to multiple authors from Monroeville .
CRITICAL RESPONSE
Section::::Critical response .
The film received widespread critical acclaim .
As of July 2018 , it maintains a 91 % rating on Rotten Tomatoes , based on 57 reviews .
According to Bosley Crowther : Horton Foote 's script and the direction of Mr. Mulligan may not penetrate that deeply , but they do allow Mr. Peck and little Miss Badham and Master Alford to portray delightful characters .
Their charming enactments of a father and his children in that close relationship , which can occur at only one brief period , are worth all the footage of the film .
Rosemary Murphy as a neighbor , Brock Peters as the Negro on trial , and Frank Overton as a troubled sheriff are good as locality characters , too .
James Anderson and Collin Wilcox as Southern bigots are almost caricatures .
But those are minor shortcomings in a rewarding film .
Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun - Times criticized the film for focusing less on the blacks , denouncing the cliché of the honest , white man standing for a helpless black :
It expresses the liberal pieties of a more innocent time , the early 1960s , and it goes very easy on the realities of small - town Alabama in the 1930s .
One of the most dramatic scenes shows a lynch mob facing Atticus , who is all by himself on the jailhouse steps the night before Tom Robinson 's trial .
The mob is armed and prepared to break in and hang Robinson , but Scout bursts onto the scene , recognizes a poor farmer who has been befriended by her father , and shames him ( and all the other men ) into leaving .
Her speech is a calculated strategic exercise , masked as the innocent words of a child ; one shot of her eyes shows she realizes exactly what she 's doing .
Could a child turn away a lynch mob at that time , in that place ?
Is n't it nice to think so .
Walt Disney requested the film be privately screened in his house .
At the film 's conclusion , Disney sadly stated , " That was one hell of a picture .
That 's the kind of film I wish I could make . "
GREGORY PECK Section::::Gregory Peck .
Gregory Peck 's performance became synonymous with the role and character of Atticus Finch .
Producer Alan J. Pakula remembered hearing from Peck when he was first approached with the role : " He called back immediately .
No maybes .
[ … ] I must say the man and the character he played were not unalike " .
Peck later said in an interview that he was drawn to the role because the book reminded him of growing up in La Jolla , California . "
Hardly a day passes that I do n't think how lucky I was to be cast in that film " , Peck said in a 1997 interview .
" I recently sat at a dinner next to a woman who saw it when she was 14-years - old , and she said it changed her life .
I hear things like that all the time " .
The 1962 softcover edition of the novel opens :
Harper Lee , in liner notes written for the film 's DVD re - release by Universal , wrote : Upon Peck 's death in 2003 , Brock Peters , who played Tom Robinson in the film version , quoted Harper Lee at Peck 's eulogy , saying , " Atticus Finch gave him an opportunity to play himself " .
Peters concluded his eulogy stating , " To my friend Gregory Peck , to my friend Atticus Finch , vaya con Dios " .
Peters remembered the role of Tom Robinson when he recalled , " It certainly is one of my proudest achievements in life , one of the happiest participations in film or theater I have experienced " .
Peters remained friends not only with Peck but with Mary Badham throughout his life .
Peck himself admitted that many people have reminded him of this film more than any other film he has ever done .
