Steven Spielberg acquired the rights for the book in 1991 , planning to produce a traditionally animated film based on the book .
However , around the time DreamWorks was founded , producer John H. Williams brought the book to DreamWorks , and co founder Jeffrey Katzenberg was interested in the concept .
As a result , DreamWorks ended up acquiring the rights for the book in 1995 , and Katzenberg quickly put the film in active development .
Shrek was released on May 18 , 2001 , starring the voices of Mike Myers , Eddie Murphy , Cameron Diaz , and John Lithgow .
The film was a critical and commercial success and won the first ever Academy Award for Best Animated Feature .
The film 's triumph ultimately led to the releases of three sequels : Shrek 2 ( 2004 ) , Shrek the Third ( 2007 ) , and Shrek Forever After ( 2010 ) with a reboot currently in development .
Spin offs of the Shrek film series include the holiday specials Shrek the Halls ( November 2007 ) and Scared Shrekless ( October 2010 ) ; a musical adaptation ( 2008 ) ; and the film Puss in Boots ( October 2011 ) , a spin off prequel starring the franchise 's character of the same name .
