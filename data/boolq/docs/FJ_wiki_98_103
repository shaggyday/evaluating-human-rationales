CONSUMER REVOLUTION
The term Consumer revolution refers to the period from approximately 1600 to 1750 in England in which there was a marked increase in the consumption and variety of " luxury " goods and products by individuals from different economic and social backgrounds .
The consumer revolution marked a departure from the traditional mode of life that was dominated by frugality and scarcity to one of increasingly mass consumption in society .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Consumerism has weak links with the Western world , but is in fact an international phenomenon .
People purchasing goods and consuming materials in excess of their basic needs is as old as the first civilizations ( e.g. Ancient Egypt , Babylon and Ancient Rome ) .
The consumer society emerged in the late seventeenth century and intensified throughout the eighteenth century .
Change was propelled by the growing middle - class who embraced new ideas about luxury consumption and the growing importance of fashion as an arbiter for purchasing rather than necessity .
This revolution encompassed the growth in construction of vast country estates specifically designed to cater for comfort and the increased availability of luxury goods aimed at a growing market .
This included sugar , tobacco , tea and coffee ; these were increasingly grown on vast slave plantations in Caribbean colonies as demand steadily rose .
In particular , sugar consumption in Britain during the course of the 18th century increased by a factor of 20 .
Moreover , the expansion of trade and markets also contributed to the burgeoning consumer revolution , by increasing the variety of goods that could be made available to affluent society .
This pattern was particularly visible in London where the gentry and prosperous merchants took up residence and created a culture of luxury and consumption that was slowly extended across the socio - economic divide .
Marketplaces expanded as shopping centres , such as the New Exchange , opened in 1609 by Robert Cecil in the Strand .
Shops started to become important as places for Londoners to meet and socialise and became popular destinations alongside the theatre .
Restoration London also saw the growth of luxury buildings as advertisements for social position with speculative architects like Nicholas Barbon and Lionel Cranfield .
There was growth in industries like glass making and silk manufacturing , and much pamphleteering of the time was devoted to justifying private vice for luxury goods for the greater public good .
This then scandalous line of thought caused great controversy with the publication of Bernard Mandeville 's influential work The Fable of the Bees in 1714 , in which he argued that a country 's prosperity ultimately lay in the self - interest of the consumer .
These trends were vastly accelerated in the 18th century , as rising prosperity and social mobility increased the number of people with disposable income for consumption .
Important shifts included the marketing of goods for individuals as opposed to items for the household , and the new status of goods as status symbols , related to changes in fashion and desired for aesthetic appeal , as opposed to just their utility .
The pottery inventor and entrepreneur , Josiah Wedgwood , noticed the way aristocratic fashions , themselves subject to periodic changes in direction , slowly filtered down through society .
He pioneered the use of marketing techniques to influence and manipulate the direction of the prevailing tastes and preferences to cause his goods to be accepted among the aristocracy ; it was only a matter of time before his goods were being rapidly bought up by the middle classes as well .
His example was followed by other producers of a wide range of products and the spread and importance of consumption fashions became steadily more important .
SEMI - LUXURY AND IMITATION Section::::Semi - Luxury and Imitation .
Popular culture drew aesthetic techniques , design , and technology from the goods England gathered from trade in Asia and the Mediterranean .
With the increased demand for Asian ceramics , European markets had difficulty supplying buyers
so inventors started imitating Chinese porcelain .
Porcelain remained popular for tableware and pottery , but the style , shape and decoration of the porcelain changed to fit more Western tastes , painting flowers and English scenes rather than Chinese ones .
Imitation goods were also used to disguise social class .
Middle - class consumers could not afford the same exotic luxury goods brought back from overseas trade that the elite class used to distinguish their elevated rank .
Markets and shops whose target buyers were middle - class consumers began creating " semi - luxury " goods that imitated actual luxury goods .
These goods were part of a movement to create a " counterfeit culture " that gave middle - class consumers an opportunity to emulate the wealth and luxurious life that the elite class lived without paying as much .
Household decorations , kitchenware , clothes , and transportation vehicles were all objects that could be used to crossover into " polite society . "
England was concerned with the quantity products exported out of England in comparison to the countries they traded with .
England did not want to be overcome economically by countries in Asia because they did not export as much so merchants , artisans , and shopkeepers started creating their own goods to compete with the Asian market .
To avoid entirely copying Asian goods , English inventors imitated goods from other countries that also traded with Asia such as France , Holland , Switzerland , and Spain .
The goal was not to mimic the exact product , but instead use the techniques that proved successful in other European imitations to create a superior product .
Imitation and semi - luxury goods were also popular because they showed the modernization of English production and manufacturing processes .
Large - scale production required standardization , advanced mechanical replication , and an organized system of assembly .
Substitutes for the indigenous materials used to create the original products were seen as a show of enlightened and advanced thinking .
The imitation and innovation of semi - luxury goods was a testament to the potential the English had to impact the global economy , to be France , China and India in national exports .
