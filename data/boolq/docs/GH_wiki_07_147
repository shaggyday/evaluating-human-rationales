HISTORY Section::::History .
San Tan Valley derives its name from the nearby San Tan Mountains .
Previously referred to as San Tan Heights , San Tan Foothills , Greater San Tan and simply the San Tan Area , the community lacked any official name and residents used nearby Queen Creek for their mailing addresses .
To coincide with the addition of a new ZIP code for the community on July 1 , 2009 , the United States Postal Service was petitioned to provide the area with a new name .
As part of the initial request , " Bella Vista " name was submitted to the postal service , but some local residents opposed the suggested name .
In response , the Greater San Tan Area Coalition organized a non - binding vote from June 16 â€“ 22 , offering residents the opportunity to vote on a name for the community .
On June 23 , 2009 , a room full of people , including the current Pinal County Supervisor , counted the votes and San Tan Valley became the new name of the area .
The area , which had consisted primarily of undeveloped desert and agriculture prior to 2000 , experienced considerable growth in the early part of the decade .
As early as 2004 , attempts to incorporate the area were underway .
An initial attempt , which proposed a name of simply " San Tan " for the area , was blocked by the neighboring town of Florence after rural residents there expressed concern that allowing incorporation would accelerate the urbanization of the area .
A subsequent effort in 2005 failed to gain traction .
Following the renaming of the area in 2009 , a renewed effort at incorporation sought to put the issue to a vote in 2010 , this time with the support of Pinal County .
The Town Council of Florence unanimously rejected a resolution that would have approved San Tan Valley 's proposed boundaries over concerns of their allotment of state shared revenue .
History of the name " San Tan "
The words " San Tan " have a rich Native American background and originates from the Tohono O'odham ( Papago ) for the Spanish words " Santa Ana " or in English , Saint Anne .
The word was used to name a mountain range that sits in north eastern Pinal County , soaring up to a 3010 foot elevation .
It is home to a 10,000 acre park with hiking trails , native american petroglyphs and diverse geology .
Because the mountain range sits also on southern border of Maricopa county , many people in both Pinal and southern Maricopa counties identify with SanTan area and word .
