POLICE IMPERSONATION
Police impersonation is an act of falsely portraying oneself as a member of the police , for the purpose of deception .
In the vast majority of countries , the practice is illegal and carries a custodial sentence .
Impersonating a police officer is sometimes committed in order to assert police - like authority in order to commit a crime .
Posing as a police officer enables the offender to legitimize the appearance of an illegal act , such as : burglary , making a traffic stop , or detaining .
Dressing up as a police officer in costume ( e.g. for Halloween ) , or pretending to be a police officer for the purpose of play or a harmless prank toward an acquaintance is generally not considered a crime , provided that those involved recognize the imposter is not a real police officer , and the imposter is not trying to deceive those involved into thinking they are .
Nevertheless , replica police uniforms sold in the UK must not be identical to the uniforms currently used by the police , and traders have been jailed in the past for selling on genuine uniforms
The following impersonations class as the offence :
* Verbal identification : The imposter announces to the unsuspecting victim that they are a police officer or other law enforcement agent .
* Fake Badge or Warrant card : The imposter , though not in any special clothes , displays a police - like badge or identification card to the victim .
Sometimes , even a real police officer will not even be able to differentiate between the real and fake badge , as some duplicates are very similar to a real badge , if not identical to one .
This is much more of a problem in the USA than in the UK , as in the UK , police identification includes photographic ID as well as the police shield , whereas in the USA , a police shield alone counts as ID , making it easier for people to pretend to be police officers .
* Fake uniform : The imposter wears a uniform that looks very much like that of a police officer .
* Fake vehicle : The imposter places police lights ( these can be either permanently mounted onto the car or temporary lights magnetically attached to the cartop ) , decals , siren , or other equipment on a personal vehicle to disguise it as a police car and enable the offender to pass through red traffic lights , bypass traffic other non - emergency traffic would have to wait for , make traffic stops , or even arrests .
Much of the equipment described above is available for purchase by the general public , thereby enabling imposters to obtain the necessary materials to commit such a crime .
While the equipment will not bear the name of a specific law enforcement agency , the unsuspecting victim may not notice the difference .
In an extreme case , a Hempstead , New York man set up a fake police station in addition to the above , where he interrogated those he arrested .
Some of the following crimes have been committed while impersonating a police officer :
* Home invasion , by gaining entry under the guise of a police officer , followed by theft from the premises , rape , torture , or in rare cases , murder .
* Theft and motor vehicle theft - approaching a victim , explaining that an item or a vehicle is stolen .
The impersonator will then seize the " evidence " and never return it .
* Armed robbery , following a traffic stop * Kidnapping following a traffic stop or false arrest
* Fake authority , in which the officer attempts to extort money from the victim , claiming it is a fine , or can be paid on the spot to avoid further legal consequences .
* Prank phone calls and other fraudulent / deceptive electronic communications , where one might make a comment about a group that invites retaliation .
