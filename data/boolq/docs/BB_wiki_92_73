Hank Pym debuted in a seven - page solo cover story titled " The Man in the Ant Hill " ( about a character who tests shrinking technology on himself ) in the science fiction / fantasy anthology Tales to Astonish # 27 ( cover date Jan. 1962 ) .
The creative team was editor - plotter Stan Lee , scripter Larry Lieber , penciler Jack Kirby , and inker Dick Ayers , with Lee stating in 2008 :
" I did one comic book called ' The Man in the Ant Hill ' about a guy who shrunk down and there were ants or bees chasing him .
That sold so well that I thought making him into a superhero might be fun . "
As a result , Pym was revived eight issues later as the costumed superhero Ant - Man who starred in the 13-page , three - chapter story " Return of the Ant - Man / An Army of Ants /
The Ant - Man 's Revenge " in Tales to Astonish # 35 ( Sept. 1962 ) .
The character 's adventures became an ongoing feature in the title .
Issue # 44 ( June 1963 ) featured the debut of his socialite girlfriend and laboratory assistant Janet van Dyne .
Janet adopted the costumed identity of the Wasp , and co - starred in Pym 's subsequent appearances in Tales to Astonish .
Wasp also on occasion acted as a framing - sequence host for backup stories in the title .
In September 1963 , Lee and Kirby created the superhero title The Avengers , and Ant - Man and Wasp were established in issue # 1 as founding members of the team .
Decades later , Lee theorized as to why " Ant - Man never became one of our top sellers or had his own book , " saying , Pym began what would be a constant shifting of superhero identities in Tales to Astonish , becoming the tall Giant - Man in issue # 49 ( Nov. 1963 ) .
Pym and van Dyne continued to costar in the title until issue # 69 ( July 1965 ) , while simultaneously appearing in The Avengers until issue # 15 ( April 1965 ) , after which the couple temporarily left the team .
Pym rejoined the Avengers and adopted the new identity Goliath in Avengers # 28 ( May 1966 ) .
Gradually falling to mental strain , he adopted the fourth superhero identity Yellowjacket in issue # 59 ( Dec. 1968 ) .
Pym reappeared as Ant - Man in Avengers # 93 ( Nov. 1971 ) and for issues # 4–10 starred in the lead story of the first volume of Marvel Feature ( July 1972 – July 1973 ) .
During this run he appeared in a redesigned costume with a nail as a weapon .
After appearing occasionally as Yellowjacket in the 1980s and battling mental and emotional issues , Pym would temporarily abandon a costumed persona .
Pym joined the West Coast Avengers as a scientist and inventor in West Coast Avengers vol .

# 21 ( June 1987 ) .

When the team disbanded after a series of tragedies , Pym , using the Yellowjacket persona again , took a leave of absence beginning with vol .
3 , # 85 ( Sept. 2004 ) .
Following the death of van Dyne , a grieving Pym took on yet another superhero identity as the new iteration of Wasp , in tribute to the woman he had married and divorced by this time , in the one - shot publication Secret Invasion : Requiem ( Jan. 2009 ) .
Giant - Man appeared as a supporting character in Avengers Academy from issue # 1 ( Aug. 2010 ) through its final issue # 39 ( Jan. 2013 ) .

Section::::1960s .
Biochemist Dr. Henry " Hank " Pym discovers an unusual set of subatomic particles he labels " Pym particles " .
Entrapping these within two separate serums , he creates a size - altering formula and a reversal formula , testing them on himself .
Reduced to the size of an insect , he becomes trapped in an anthill before he eventually escapes and uses the reversal formula to restore himself to his normal size .
Deciding the serums are too dangerous to exist , he destroys them .
Shortly afterward , he reconsiders his decision and recreates his serums .
Pym 's experience in the anthill inspires him to study ants , and he constructs a cybernetic helmet that allows him to communicate with and control them .
Pym designs a costume made of unstable molecules to prevent bites or scratches from the ants , and reinvents himself as the superhero Ant - Man .
After several adventures , Pym is contacted by Dr. Vernon van Dyne asking for aid in contacting alien life .
Pym refuses , but is attracted to Vernon 's socialite daughter Janet van Dyne .
Vernon is subsequently killed by an alien criminal who teleports himself to Earth , and Janet asks for Pym 's help in avenging Vernon 's death .
Pym reveals his secret identity to Janet , and uses Pym particles to graft wasp wings beneath her shoulders , which appear when Janet shrinks .

Yellowjacket briefly betrays the team to Immortus and the powerful Time - Keepers try to create a timeline where he will not turn back into Pym , but he rejects this decision in time to help his allies .
Observing the final battle , Libra - who brought the team together by using the Destiny Force to tap into his subconscious awareness of the cosmic balance - reflects that both Pyms were necessary so that Yellowjacket 's betrayal could bring the team into the right position to attack the Time - Keepers , while Pym 's presence as Giant - Man both provided a stable support and irritated Yellowjacket to provoke his own actions .
Back in the present , an encounter with Kulan Gath results in Pym being split into his two personas of Pym and Yellowjacket , after a spell cast by Gath temporarily transforms Pym into a swashbuckler - style Yellowjacket , followed by the Yellowjacket persona manifesting a physical presence from the extradimensional bio - mass Pym uses to grow .
