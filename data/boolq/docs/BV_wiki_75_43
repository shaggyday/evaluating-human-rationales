FICTIONAL CHARACTER
BIOGRAPHY KID
FLASH Section::::Fictional character biography .
Section::::Kid Flash .
Wallace Rudolph West , or Wally West , was created by John Broome and Carmine Infantino and introduced in The Flash # 110 ( 1959 ) .
The character was the nephew of the existing Flash character 's girlfriend and later wife , Iris West .
During a visit to the Central City police laboratory where Barry Allen worked , the freak accident that gave Allen his powers repeated itself , bathing Wally in electrically charged chemicals .
Now possessing the same powers as the Flash , West donned a smaller - sized copy of Barry Allen 's Flash outfit and became the young crimefighter Kid Flash .
Wally had a strained relationship with his own parents and often looked to his beloved aunt and uncle for moral support and guidance .
He also operated as a lone superhero in his hometown , Blue Valley , Nebraska , when not partnering with the Flash .
This costume was later altered ( in The Flash # 135 ( 1963 ) ) to one that would make him more visually distinctive .
The original red was replaced with a costume that was primarily yellow with red leggings , gloves and lightning bolt emblem .
The ear pieces initially remained yellow , but became red in later issues .
In addition to his appearances within the Flash title , the character was a founding member of the newly created Teen Titans , where he became friends with Dick Grayson , then known as Robin , later known as Nightwing .
Sometime later , Wally contracted a mysterious illness that affected his entire bodily system ; the more he used his speed powers , the faster his body deteriorated .
This could have been caused by one of two things , Wally was a boy when the electrified chemicals altered his body , which was still developing and maturing ( as opposed to Barry Allen , who was already an adult when his accident occurred ) or when his was struck with a weapon during his time with the Teen Titans .
As such , as Wally 's body matured , his altered body chemistry was slowly killing him .
THE FLASH Section::::The Flash .
During the 1985–1986 miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths , Barry gave his life to save the Earth when destroying the antimatter cannon that was aimed at Earth .
Initially unaware of this , Wally was coaxed by Jay Garrick into assisting the heroes against the Anti - Monitor 's forces .
During the final battle with the Anti - Monitor , Wally was struck by a blast of anti - matter energy , which cured his disease .
In the aftermath of the conflict , Wally took on his fallen mentor 's costume and identity .
The decision by DC Comics ' editorial staff to radically change their fictional universe saw a number of changes to the status quo of the character .
Wally West became the new Flash , but less powerful than his predecessor .
For example , instead of being able to reach the speed of light , he could run just faster than that of sound .
Also , the character had to eat vast quantities of food to maintain his metabolism .
Those changes were quickly followed up and 1987 saw the publication of a new Flash comic , initially written by Mike Baron .
These stories focused not only on the Flash 's superhero exploits , but the state of Wally 's wealth .
West won a lottery , bought a large mansion , and began dating beautiful women .
The character 's finances and luck continued to ebb and wane until Flash vol .
2 ,
# 62 , when his fortunes stabilized .
The 1990s also saw further modifications to the look of the character , with a modified uniform appearing in 1991 .
This modified costume altered the visual appearance of the traditional Flash costume , with a belt made of two connecting lightning bolts meeting in a " V " at the front ( where Allen 's costume had a single bolt in a horizontal band ) , removal of the wings from the top of his boots , a change in the material of his costume , and opaque lenses added to the eyes of his cowl .
This modified design utilized elements of the costume designed by artist Dave Stevens for the live action television series The Flash .
A difficult encounter was made with a vicious foe , the first Reverse - Flash ( Eobard Thawne ) .
Thawne had been killed by Barry Allen shortly before Allen 's death , but this version of Thawne was from a time period before he originally became Allen 's enemy - also served to increase the speed of the character , forcing him to push past a psychological block he had placed on his powers .
To prevent himself from truly " replacing " Barry , Wally had subconsciously limited his speed so that he could never become his mentor 's equal , but when Thawne arrived in the present and briefly posed as Barry Allen , his bragging that he would become the true Flash forced Wally past this block , as he feared Thawne replacing Barry more than he feared himself doing so .
After this encounter , he was again Barry Allen 's equal in speed , and eventually became even faster .
Though he still had not been able to recover Barry 's vibrational / phasing abilities for a time ( he could vibrate through objects but this would cause the object to explode ) , he gained several new powers that Barry never had .
He was able to share / steal speed , use his speed to kinetically upgrade his attacks , and super heal others .
Writer Mark Waid expanded on the character 's powers thematically and further redefined the character by introducing the Speed Force , an energy source that served as a pseudo - scientific explanation for his powers and that of other fictional speedsters within the DC Universe .
Using this concept as a basis , the character 's ability to tap into the Speed Force was used to expand his abilities .
The character was now able to lend speed to other objects and people and create a costume directly out of Speed Force energy .
Traditional powers such as the ability to vibrate through solid objects were also restored .
Because of this , the Flash felt pressured into having to constantly be heroic 24/7 .
During this time , he joined the latest incarnation of the Justice League .
The 2000s saw writer Geoff Johns revitalize the character by introducing new versions of characters such as Zoom ; making significant use of the Rogues ; and marrying the character to longtime girlfriend Linda Park .
Other changes included restoring the Flash to a secret identity ; his identity had been public since shortly after Barry Allen 's death , but the traumatic events of his first battle with Zoom prompted Wally to make a deal with the Spectre to erase his identity from public knowledge ( although this was initially so successful that even Wally forgot he was the Flash ) .
In the miniseries Infinite Crisis , as a narrative device , Wally West and his family were seen leaving for an alternative reality .
This allowed the character Bart Allen to become the fourth Flash and headline a relaunched third volume of the title , called The Flash :
The Fastest Man Alive .
The critical reaction to this new version of the character was mixed and the character was killed off in the final issue of the short - lived third volume .
It was decided that Wally West should return , and the JLA / JSA story " The Lightning Saga " was used to return the character to Earth along with his wife and children , who appear to have aged several years .
The character next appeared in All Flash # 1 ( 2007 ) , seeking vengeance on those who had killed Bart Allen .
This was followed by The Flash vol .
2 , which resumed publication after the long hiatus with issue # 231 ( October 2007 ) .
The series found the character struggling with trying to raise his two super - powered twins , plagued by accelerated growth and their inexperience in the heroic game , a task made more difficult by Wally 's unemployment , his inability to keep a steady job , and the mistrust of the League for his decision to bring two children into the fold .
The series was canceled with issue # 247 ( February 2009 ) .
In Final Crisis , the character was reunited with Barry Allen , who had returned to life .
THE FLASH :
REBIRTH Section::::The Flash : Rebirth .
Interviews with artist Ethan Van Sciver revealed that the character would adopt a newly designed costume in the limited series that reintroduces Barry Allen as the Flash .
The new costume is heavily inspired by the original changes made to the suit in Flash vol .
2 , # 50 ( cowl lenses , " wingless " boots , the belt - line V - shape , a lightning bolt logo with a sharp S - shape , and the darker red color of the suit ) , which were slipping in and out of usage when the character was drawn by different artists .
Wally 's costume has also been given a straight cowl BLACKEST NIGHT
Section::::Blackest Night .
During the Blackest Night , Wally West assists Barry Allen in spreading the word to every hero on Earth about the rise of the Black Lantern Corps .
When Black Hand brings back Nekron , Barry is attacked by an army of Black Lanterns , while struggling to fight them off , Wally comes to his rescue , bringing with him the Justice League & Teen Titans , Bart Allen , the Kid Flash , among them .
The three Flashes fight their way through Black Lanterns and charge at Nekron .
Before they can strike , the Black Lantern Guardian Scar attacks them , attempting to convince them into becoming Black Lanterns .
Right after , Hal Jordan and the leaders of the seven Lantern Corps arrive to assist .
The heroes attack the Black Lanterns , but when Black Hand reanimates Batman 's corpse as a Black Lantern , the resulting emotional shock allows the Black Lantern rings to latch onto the resurrected heroes , transforming Superman , Superboy , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , and Kid Flash into Black Lanterns .
Black Lantern Bart Allen attacks Barry Allen , and the two brawl for a moment before Wally fights him off .
A pair of Black Lantern Rings then lock onto Barry and Hal .
Wally flees with Barry , with Barry telling him to stay and protect himself and Bart .
Barry and Hal then flee the scene to avoid becoming Black Lanterns .
RETURN :
THE NEW 52 AND REBIRTH Section::::Return : The New 52 and Rebirth .
Following the 2011 reboot of the DC comics universe , Wally West appears to have never existed .
A seemingly new interpretation of Wally West was introduced in The Flash Annual # 3 .
Originally portrayed as the New 52 version of the classic and original character and the biracial son of Rudy West , this biracial Wally , named Wallace West in later comics , was retconned in DC Rebirth # 1 as being the cousin of Wally West , and the son of the New 52 Reverse Flash , Daniel West .
Both cousins are explained as having been named after their great - grandfather .
The existence of the original Wally West is hinted at in the final issue of Titans Hunt , in which the various original Teen Titans remember their bond to each other , but realise that they are still forgetting an important final member of their team .
They look out to the ocean as lightning strikes .
Wally West is reintroduced to DC continuity a week later in DC Rebirth story .
The story reveals that following the Flashpoint event , Wally became lost in the Speed Force for 10 years .
While trapped , he came to realize that Barry had not been responsible for the mutation of the New Earth universe into Prime Earth but that an unknown entity had used Barry 's time travelling as an opportunity to fundamentally alter reality .
The fallout of the recent Darkseid War allowed Wally to try and reach out to his former friends in the hopes of either returning or warning them of the truth .
Each attempt caused him to fall further into the Speed Force .
After realizing not even Linda ( his traditional " lightning rod " ) could remember him , Wally sank into desolation and chose to appear before his uncle , Barry , one last time to thank him for the life he had given him .
Just before Wally disappeared , Barry remembered him and dragged him free of the Speed Force .
Wally 's presence integrates his pre - Flashpoint history to the new timeline to accommodate his existence , resetting his past and those who associated with him .
Following a tearful reunion , Wally gave Barry his warning of the true source of the universal change and the dangers to come .
Although the two decide to keep Wally 's return secret from Iris based on Wally 's own experience with Linda , Barry encourages him to return to the Titans , but also recommends that he don a new costume to reflect that he is the Flash rather than ' Kid Flash ' .
Wally goes to the Titans , and through both physical contact to Nightwing , Donna Troy , Arsenal , Tempest , and Lilith Clay with the Speed Force reminding them of their memories with him , creating a new history .
After an emotional reunion with his friends , he tells them of the situation .
Wally believes that the unknown entity will attack again to prevent them from finding out the truth , which they will do together as Titans .
Directly after the events in Titans : Rebirth , Lilith has Wally repeat the story of his return in order for her to use it as a means of making the mental connections between him , herself and the Titans stronger .
While doing this , she notices the most powerful thought in Wally 's mind is that of Linda Park , which sparks various , but supportive , reactions from the other Titans .
Nightwing encourages Wally to seek Linda out and try and make new memories with her .
Elsewhere , Linda is still puzzled by Wally 's sudden presence in her life and decides to investigate him further .
During a confrontation with Abra Kadabra , Wally is forced to push himself so fast that he is sent into the Speed Force while trying to save her and the other Titans from being killed by Kadabra , but in a conversation with a manifestation of his memories of Linda , Wally is encouraged not to give up on the idea that he can make a new relationship with her in this timeline , subsequently using his memories of the Titans as a new ' lightning - rod ' to return to Earth .
Afterwards , Wally is visited by Superman , who confirms that he , like Wally , remembers the world that existed before history was ' edited ' .
Later , Deathstroke wanted to use the Speed Force to save his son , and takes out Wally .
Wallace West and Damian Wayne managed to save Wally , but Damian Wayne had to stop Wally West 's heart momentarily , making Wally West have a heart pacer .
After that adventure , while on a mission with the Titans , Wally learned that he has the ability to go fast and stop time as well .
After a battle against Psimon , Mister Twister , and the Key , Wally used too much of his abilities , and he seemingly dies .
However , Kid Flash ( Wallace West ) senses Wally 's " death " and rushes to find him .
After noticing Wally West " dead " Kid Flash senses that Wally is n't completely dead , and he revives him by jumpstarting his heart , curing Wally of his pacemaker condition .
Wally West then helps the Titans defeat Donna Troy 's evil self from an alternate future , Troia and the other villains .
When Barry confronts Wally about how he has n't made any real effort to make contact with Iris , rebuild things with Linda , or even try to make a new life for himself , Wally tries to compensate for this by tracking down Frances Kane , but his initial contact with her also re - awakens her old psychological issues , causing her to attack Wally before he calms her down by confessing his own fears about his current circumstances .
Inspired by this conversation , Wally calls Dick Grayson to help him purchase an apartment .
However , Wally is unaware that his friend - turned - foe Hunter Zolomon has returned .
Now in a position of authority in the twenty - fifth century , Zolomon sends the Renegades into the past to arrest Iris for the murder of Eobard Thawne with the intention of provoking a war between the Flashes in order to make ' the true Flash ' stronger through tragedy .
After the Flash Family defeated Gorilla Grodd in a battle , Wally meets Iris for the first time after his disappeance .
He begins remembering pre - Flashpoint memories after Iris remembers him .
However , a confrontation with his former ally Hunter Zolomon provokes Barry and Wally into conflict , as Hunter convinces Wally that the Speed Force must be destroyed to release those missing allies still ' trapped ' within it , including Wally 's children , Jai and Iris West , Max Mercury and Impulse .
Wally became determined to break The Speed Force open in a bid to free them which led to a frantic chase , with Barry Allen trying to stop Wally before he did something drastic , remembering all too well the damage he himself had done to the time - stream attempting to stop his mother 's murder during the Flashpoint event .
Unfortunately , Wally proved himself to be the true Fastest Man Alive and was able to outrun Barry and create the break he wanted .
The resulting explosion sent both heroes back to Barry 's hometown of Central City and into the clutches of a gloating Zoom who quickly revealed that his true intention in reminding Wally about the existence of his children was to trick Wally into breaking The Force Barrier - a cosmic barricade that concealed energies that could be tapped into by the right people in much the same way that the Speed Force empowers speedsters .
These energies include the Sage Force - seemingly based around telepathic and telekinetic powers - and the Strength Force .
Zoom discovered the existence of these energies reading 25th century history books and determined a way to tap into these energies as well as the Speed Force once the Force Barrier was broken .
He also donned a replica of Barry Allen 's costume , declaring himself the one true Flash , before deciding that he would spare Barry and Wally the pain of their future lives by ending them now .
During the Heroes in Crisis story arc , Wally , alongside Roy Harper and various other heroes , was found deceased in the superhero rehabilitation facility known as Sanctuary .
POWERS AND ABILITIES Section::::Powers and abilities .
Wally 's primary superpower is his ability to control the speed with which his body vibrates and to move and think at super speed , which he uses primarily to run at super - human velocities .
This super speed is derived from his mainline - connection to the Speed Force : a vaguely defined extra - dimensional energy force from which most speedster heroes gain their powers .
Wally is considered the fastest Flash and is significantly faster than Barry Allen .
While most to all speedsters can make a connection and draw upon this force , West " mainlines " power from the Speed Force itself and can not be cut off from the source .
This connection to the Speed Force grants him unique abilities that other speedsters lack , such as lending and taking speed ( which manifests in different ways , ranging from becoming speedsters themselves to bolstering others metabolisms and healing abilities , allowing them to recover from injuries in a fraction of the normal time ) , as well as absorbing kinetic energy in a less direct manner ; he once absorbed the kinetic energy of the entire planet Earth while standing at the North Pole when his teammates were forced to move the planet to prevent possible earthquakes .
Wally has also found a way to create a costume out of pure Speed Force energy .
Like all Flashes , Wally is surrounded by a protective aura that allows him to resist the heat created by the pressure of compressed air caused by moving at super speed as well as other environmental consequences of moving at such velocities .
It is not known how Wally is able to circumvent the damage moving at such great speeds
would normally have on the environment , but it has been hypothesized that his protective aura allows him to " side step " such environmental consequences .
Because of his powers and connection to the Speed Force , he can run at varying speeds for extended periods of time without needing rest or causing damage to his body .
It is his connection to the Speed Force that constantly rejuvenates him while running , making it so he does not literally feed upon his own body to generate the energy for super speed .
Even so , he has a sped up metabolism and finds it necessary to eat often and in great quantities to help supply the chemical energy needed .
Using his abilities , Wally can run at such speed that he can run on water , create powerful vortices with his arms or body , and vibrate at such speeds that he becomes invisible to the naked eye .
Wally can also match the vibrational constant of solid objects and vibrate through them , passing his molecules through the spaces in between the atoms and molecules of the matter he is vibrating through , however ,
Wally accidentally destabilizes whatever he passes through , causing it to explode .
While this has its drawbacks , Wally has learned to use this offensively in battle .
In Rebirth 2016 , this ability is improved , now Wally can vibrate through objects without causing them to explode .
Instead of using the cosmic treadmill as his uncle Barry , Wally can use his speed to travel through time .
He also outran death to the edge of the universe and beyond , where death did n't even exist and continued to run to get Linda back .
There was a comic named The Human Race in which Wally ran faster than instant teleportation , Reaching Trans - Time Velocity .
Flash vol 2
# 177 had Wally outrun the gravitational pull of a black hole .
Using Jessie Quick 's speed formula combined with his speed steal , Wally can temporally accelerate to the point where he escapes linear time , essentially allowing him to function like the chronokenetic Zoom .
Wally 's connection to the Speed Force grants him low level electrokinetic abilities .
He generates large amounts of lightning while moving at super speed , as well as whenever he is angered .
On certain occasions , Wally has been able to project arcs of Speed Force lightning , such as when he is lending speed , or when he was using the Speed Force to restore the memories of the Titans , during DC Rebirth .
Wally West is the fastest Flash and is arguably the fastest being that has ever existed as said by Max Mercury — and it has been remarked that Wally and Barry are the only two speedsters that were fast enough to even outrun death .
Wally himself has made several references to be faster than Barry and having surpassed him .
Wally is fast enough to easily break all the speed barriers and even enter the Speed Force .
Wally has , on several occasions , traveled much faster than light and entered and exited the Speed Force by his own volition .
He has shown that he can achieve practically any speed he wishes and that there are no limits to his speed .
Some interpretations of Wally are shown as having above average strength .
On the Justice League episode " The Brave and the Bold Part 2 " , the gorilla Solovar tells Wally that he weighed around 400 lbs ; Wally then proceeded to lift Solovar and run to safety .
Wally is also a skilled science prodigy .
In some versions , like Young Justice , Wally uses these skills to recreate the accident that gave Barry his powers by himself , granting himself his own powers .
Like his mentor , Wally understands what his speed enables him to do , and uses his knowledge of physics to his advantage in battle .
After his return to the DC Universe , Wally is said to be even faster than before .
Titans ( 2016 )
# 5 issue , established that the Speed Force is inside Wally more than ever before .
He now generates white lightning , which combines all the colors of the Speed Force .
He also created his new Flash suit out of pure Speed Force energy , a red and silver costume .
Also in DC Rebirth , Wally learned that he can sense when time has been manipulated , as well as listen to the Speed Force , which allows him to sense disruptions in the space - time continuum .
Wally has had some hand - to - hand combat training , and is skilled in Judo .
ALLIES AND FRIENDS Section::::Allies and friends .

They both later attended Wally and Linda 's wedding .
While they disagree regularly , Wally has developed an odd friendship / respect with Batman , who has more than once made it clear that those feelings are mutual .
Like his predecessors , West is best friends with the Green Lantern of his time ( Kyle Rayner ) .
Wally also retained a close friendship with Kyle 's predecessor , Hal Jordan , who often looked out for Wally even while he was the Spectre .
His best friend is Dick Grayson , who served with Wally on the Teen Titans as the first Robin and served as Wally 's best man at his wedding .
The members of the New Teen Titans , the team Wally served on as Kid Flash , have reappeared several times throughout his life .
