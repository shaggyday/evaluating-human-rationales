PLOT Section::::Plot .
Former L.A. SWAT officer Jeff Talley is a hostage negotiator in Los Angeles .
One day , Talley negotiates with a man who has taken his wife and son hostage after learning his wife was cheating on him .
Shortly after Talley denies a SWAT commander 's request to give snipers the order to open fire , the despondent man kills his wife , son , and himself .
Traumatized , Talley moves with his family and becomes police chief in Bristo Camino , a fictional suburban hamlet in nearby Ventura County .
A year later , Talley finds himself in another hostage situation .
Two troubled teenaged brothers , Dennis and Kevin Kelly , and a sociopathic accomplice , Marshall " Mars " Krupcheck , all very well - armed , take Walter Smith and his two children , Jennifer and Tommy , hostage in the Smith home after a failed robbery attempt .
Dennis had told his younger brother to wait in the car , not anticipating the siege to come , but Kevin refused .
A female police officer , Carol Flores , responds after Tommy turns on the silent alarm .
She is shot twice by Mars just before Talley arrives .
She dies in front of him .
Traumatized and unwilling to put himself through another tragedy , Talley hands authority over to the county sheriff and leaves .
Smith had been laundering money for a mysterious right - wing militia and criminal syndicate through offshore shell corporations .
He was preparing to turn over a batch of important encrypted files recorded on a DVD when he was taken hostage .
To prevent the incriminating evidence from being discovered , the syndicate orders a ruthless operative , known as " the Watchman " , to kidnap Talley 's wife and daughter .
Talley is instructed by " the Watchman " , to return to the hostage scene , regain authority , and stall for time until the organization can launch its own attack against Smith 's house .
Otherwise , Talley 's wife and daughter will be murdered .
Dennis forces Kevin and Mars to tie up the children , while he knocks out Smith and finds a small fortune in cash , money which the syndicate had paid Smith .
In an attempt to end the standoff and secure the DVDs himself , Talley meets with Dennis and agrees to provide a helicopter in exchange for half of the money .
When the helicopter arrives , Dennis and Kevin bring the money to Talley and prepare to leave , but Mars refuses to leave without Jennifer , with whom he has become infatuated .
Talley says the helicopter will only carry three passengers and insists Jennifer stay behind , but the deal breaks down and the boys and Jennifer return to the house .
Talley learns that Mars is a sociopath who could turn on the hostages and his own accomplices at any moment .
Mars does , in fact , kill Kevin , just as Kevin is about to release the children .
Mars then kills Dennis .
The syndicate sends fake FBI agents to recover the DVD and they storm the house ; Talley is instructed to not go near the house .
Jennifer manages to stab Mars , but not fatally , and locks herself and Tommy in the panic room .
Hearing their screams , Talley breaches the house and is attacked by Mars , who then kills most of the fake agents using his pistol and multiple homemade Molotov cocktails .
Mars is then shot in the side by the only surviving agent .
The agent tracks down Talley and the children , and demands the encrypted DVD .
When Talley asks that the children be allowed to leave , the fake agent shoots Talley , but it is not a fatal wound .
After Talley gives him the DVD , Mars reappears , carrying two homemade Molotov cocktails , distracting the agent long enough to be killed by Talley .
Mars then prepares to throw his last Molotov , but collapses to his knees , weakened by his injuries .
He makes eye contact with Jennifer , then drops the Molotov and immolates himself .
Talley escapes with the children by shooting the indoor glass waterfall , which extinguishes the fire caused by Mars ' first Molotov .
He and a recovered Smith then go to a rundown inn where Talley 's wife and daughter are being held captive by the Watchman and his crew .
Smith , feigning hatred for Talley , is freed in exchange for the family .
While demanding that the Watchman kill Talley , Smith shoots the Watchman in the head .
This allows Talley to kill the other gunmen in similar fashion and rescue his own family .

The film 's plot is roughly the same as Crais 's novel .
The main difference is that the novel 's complicated subplot involving powerful West Coast Mafia crime lord Sonny Benza was removed , with the film giving little explanation of Walter Smith 's criminal associates .
The film also makes the first group of hostage - takers somewhat younger in age than depicted in the novel .
In addition , the criminal syndicate in the film were portrayed as domestic right - wing extremists rather than a Mafia .
Filming took place in the Malibu area ( in western Los Angeles County ) .
The exterior views of Smith 's lavishly appointed house were filmed at a real house in the unincorporated Topanga Canyon area , between Malibu and Los Angeles ; the interior scenes were done on sound stages in Hollywood .
The character Mars , played by Ben Foster , was modeled after Bay Area rap artist Mars by Robert Crais after a friend Dennis Bsharah urged him to look into the horrorcore genre .
In the movie adaptation , Foster strongly resembles the rapper .
Jonathan Tucker 's name was later changed to Dennis .
The movie 's opening scenes were filmed in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of East Los Angeles , just east of downtown .
The fictional city of Bristo Camino was possibly intended to be a representation of Ojai or Moorpark .
Bristo Bay is the name of Bristo Camino in the 2001 Robert Crais novel .
