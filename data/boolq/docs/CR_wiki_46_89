VIEWING ( FUNERAL )
In funeral services , a viewing ( sometimes referred to as calling hours , reviewal , funeral visitation or a wake in the United States , Canada and Ireland ) is the time that the family and friends come to see the deceased after they have been prepared by a funeral home .
It is generally recommended ( however not necessary ) that any body to be viewed be embalmed in order to create the best possible presentation of the deceased .
A viewing may take place at the funeral parlor , in a family home or at a church or chapel prior to the actual funeral service .
Some cultures , such as the MƒÅori of New Zealand , often take the body to the Marae or tribal community hall .
Viewing is sometimes combined with a service called a wake although in some places the term wake is interchangeable with viewing .
Many authorities consider the viewing important to the grieving process as it gives a chance to say goodbye on a personal level .
It can also make it easier to accept the reality of the death , which can often seem unreal especially in the industrial world where death is handled by professionals and the family may only know of a death through phone calls rather than experiencing it as it occurs .
