HISTORY Section::::History .
Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. was formed in 1997 when Royal Caribbean Cruise Line , founded in 1968 , and Celebrity Cruises , founded in 1988 , was then purchased .
The decision was made to keep the two cruise line brands separate following the merger ; as a result Royal Caribbean Cruise Line was re - branded Royal Caribbean International and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. was established as the new parent company of both Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises .
A third brand under Royal Caribbean Cruises ownership was formed in 2000 when Island Cruises was created as a joint venture with British First Choice Holidays .
Island Cruises became an informal cruise line on the British and Brazilian markets .
In November 2006 , Royal Caribbean Cruises purchased Pullmantur Cruises based in Madrid , Spain .
From there , the company expanded rapidly with the creation of Azamara Club Cruises in May 2007 as a subsidiary of Celebrity Cruises .
It followed this with the formation of CDF Croisières de France in May 2008 to serve the French - language market .
Royal Caribbean also has an interest in TUI Cruises , a joint venture with TUI AG , which began operations in 2009 aimed at a German - speaking audience .
TUI Cruises 's subsidiary , TUI Travel , had a 50 % interest in Island Cruises following their merger with First Choice Holidays in 2007 .
In October 2008 , Royal Caribbean Cruises rationalized their holdings by selling their share of Island Cruises to TUI .
