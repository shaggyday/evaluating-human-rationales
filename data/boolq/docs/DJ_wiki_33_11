AMERICA 'S GOT TALENT
America 's Got Talent ( often abbreviated as AGT ) is a televised American talent show competition , broadcast on the NBC television network .
It is part of the global Got Talent franchise created by Simon Cowell , and is produced by Fremantle and SYCOtv , with distribution done by Fremantle .
Since its premiere in June 2006 , each season is run during the network 's summer schedule , with the show having featured various hosts - it is currently hosted by Tyra Banks , since 2017 .
It is the first global edition of the franchise , after plans for a British edition in 2005 were suspended , following a dispute between Paul O'Grady , the planned host , and the British broadcaster ITV ; production of this edition later resumed in 2007 .
The show attracts a variety of participants , from across the United States and abroad , to take part and who possess some form of talents , with acts ranging from singing , dancing , comedy , magic , stunts , variety , and other genres .
Each participant who auditions attempts to secure a place in the live episodes of a season by impressing a panel of judges - the current line - up consists of Cowell , Howie Mandel , Mel B , and Heidi Klum .
Those that make it into the live episodes compete against each other for both the judges ' and public 's vote in order to reach the live final , where the winner receives a large cash prize , paid over a period of time , and , since the third season , a chance to headline a show on the Las Vegas Strip .
Since its premiere , America 's Got Talent has helped to unearth new talent and kickstart / boost the careers of various performers who took part in the competition , while the show itself has been a rating success for NBC , drawing in on average around 10 million viewers per season .
In 2013 , a book was entitled Inside AGT : The Untold Stories of America 's Got Talent , was released , providing a description of the seasons , contestants , judges , and production techniques of the show , along with detailed interviews with contestants from all seasons , up to the date of the book 's of publication .
The show finished airing its thirteenth season , which ran from May 29 to September 19 , 2018 .
A winter - spin off edition is currently being planned , entitled , featuring acts from previous seasons , as well as acts from international Got Talent shows .
FORMAT AUDITIONS Section::::Format .
Section::::Auditions .
The general selection process of each season is begun by the production team with open auditions held in various cities across the United States .
Dubbed " Producers ' Auditions " , they are held months before the main stage of auditions are held .
Those that make it through the initial stage , become participants in the " Judges ' Auditions " , which are held in select cities across the country , and attended by the judges .
Each participant is held offstage and awaits their turn to perform before the judges , whereupon they are given 90 seconds to demonstrate their act , with a live audience present for all performances .
At the end of a performance , the judges give constructive criticism and feedback about what they saw , whereupon they each give a vote - a participant who receives a majority vote approving their performance , moves on to the next stage , otherwise they are eliminated from the programme at that stage .
Each judge is given a buzzer , and may use it during a performance if they are unimpressed , hate what is being performed , or feel the act is a waste of their time ; if a participant is buzzed by all judges , their performance is automatically over .
Many acts that move on may be cut by producers and may forfeit due to the limited slots available for the second performance .
Filming for each season always takes place when the Judges ' Auditions are taking place , with the show 's presenter standing in the wings of each venue 's stage to interview and give personal commentary on a participant 's performance .
Between the fifth and seventh season , acts who did not attend live auditions could instead submit a taped audition online via YouTube .
Acts from the online auditions were then selected to compete in front of the judges and a live audience during the " live shows " part of the season , prior to the semi - finals .
Before the inclusion of this round , the show had a separate audition episode in Seasons 3 and 4 ( 2008â€“2009 ) for contestants who posted videos on MySpace .
In the ninth season , the show added a new format to the auditions in the form of the " Golden Buzzer " , which began to make appearances within the Got Talent franchise , since it was first introduced on Germany 's Got Talent .
During auditions , each judge is allowed to use the Golden Buzzer to send an act automatically into the live shows , regardless of the opinion of the other judges ; when it was initially used , the buzzer simply saved an act from elimination .
The only rule to the buzzer was that a judge could use it only once per season ; the host was later allowed to use the Golden Buzzer for an act from the eleventh season .
JUDGE CUTS Section::::Judge Cuts .
Following auditions , successful entries take part in a second stage of the talent competition , in which they are separated out into a number of groups .
Over the course of several weeks , each group performs per week , at a fixed venue , in which that group 's participants each attempt to secure a place in the live show by performing a new variation of their act for the judges .
Of these acts , the judges chose around 10 from each group to perform in the live shows ; in some seasons , participants eliminated at this stage were given a chance to still appear in the live shows by being selected as a " wildcard " act .
The judges have access to their buzzers and if an act is buzzed by all of them , they are immediately eliminated from the competition .
Until the second season , acts did not have to perform a second time , instead moving on into the live shows , with the judges given a list of the acts who would appear in each live episode .
From the second season to the eighth , this stage was dubbed as the " Las Vegas " due to the fixed venue being situated upon the Las Vegas Strip , while in the ninth series , acts performed in New York , with the stage dubbed " Judgement Week " .
From the tenth season , the stage 's format was changed and renamed as " Judge Cuts " .
In each round , the judging panel were joined by a guest judge who helped with making decisions on which act could move on to the live shows .
Like the auditions , the guest judge could use a Golden Buzzer for an act , but once used , it could not be used again .
Unlike previous seasons , the Judge Cuts featured twenty acts per round , with seven acts advancing into the live shows , including the one chosen by the guest 's golden buzzer .
Unlike the previous format for the stage , the venue used varied , but included the CBS Studio Center and the NBC Universal Back Lot .
LIVE SHOWS Section::::Live shows .
During the live shows , the final selection of participants , which has ranged from between 20 to 60 acts and include those that were chosen as Wildcards by the judges or received the Golden Buzzer , are divided into groups and compete against each other for viewers ' and judges ' votes .
The general structure of the live episodes focuses first on four quarterfinals , and then two semi - finals , aimed at finding that season 's finalists .
Additional rounds are conducted when required ( such as a " Top 8 " or a " Top 10 " , depending on the season ) .
Live episodes are broadcast weekly , and featured performances by guest stars , including previous winners of America 's Got Talent .
During these stages , the judges still provide feedback on an act 's performance when it is over , and can use buzzers to prematurely end an performance before it is over ; in the first season , the judges could not end a performance before it was over .
Acts which do not secure a sufficient number of votes by the public and/or the judges , are eliminated from the competition .
Those that make it into the season 's final compete against each other to secure the most votes from the public , with the number of finalists varying between seasons .
The act which does is declared the winner for that season , in which they secure the programme 's cash prize of $ 1 million , and , since Season 3 ( 2008 ) , a chance to headline a show on the Las Vegas Strip .
Between the fifth and eighth season , the winner was also made the headline act of a national tour with runners up following the final show , stopping in 25 cities .
For season nine , however ( 2014 ) , there was no tour ; two shows were held in Las Vegas for the winner and some of the runner - up acts .

In its first season , the judging panel consisted originally of David Hasselhoff , Brandy Norwood , and Piers Morgan , with the program hosted by Regis Philbin .
Prior to the start of the second season , Norwood was forced to step down due to a legal matter she was caught up in , leading to her being replaced by Sharon Osbourne , while Philbin was replaced by Jerry Springer as the show 's host .
Further changes were made to the panel and show 's host , as a direct result of each respective member having a need to focus on other TV commitments - Springer was forced to leave after the third season , and was replaced by Nick Cannon for the fourth season ; Hasselhoff left the show after the fourth season , and so was replaced by Howie Mandel for the fifth season as a direct result ; Morgan left after the sixth season , leading to his replacement by Howard Stern for the seventh season .
In August 2012 , Osbourne left the program following a dispute with NBC .
While the network replaced her with former Spice Girls member Mel B in February 2013 , the production staff decided to expand the number of judges in the panel to four - such a format change had already been occurring in other international versions of the competition , such as on Britain 's Got Talent two years prior .
In March 2013 , supermodel Heidi Klum was announced as joining the panel for the eighth season , confirming reports that the show would include a fourth judge into its format .
In October 2015 , Stern was replaced by Simon Cowell for the eleventh season .
After his eighth year hosting America 's Got Talent , Cannon announced plans to retire from the show due to comments he made about the network ; despite being under contract to continue his hosting duties , NBC eventually replaced him with Tyra Banks for the twelfth season .
