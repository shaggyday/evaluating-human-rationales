BANK OF IRELAND £ 5 NOTE
The Bank of Ireland £ 5 note is a banknote of the pound sterling .
It is the smallest denomination of banknote issued by the Bank of Ireland .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The Bank of Ireland began issuing notes in 1783 , the same year as the bank 's founding .
Early banknotes were denominations of the Irish Pound , but following that currency 's abolition in 1826 banknotes produced by the Bank of Ireland were denominated in pounds sterling .
These early banknotes were printed by the bank in Dublin , and featured a design with a row of Mercury heads across the top .
This basic design remained effectively unchanged for 120 years .
Northern Irish banknotes are fully backed such that holders have the same level of protection as those holding genuine Bank of England notes .
The £ 5 note is currently the smallest denomination of banknote issued by the Bank of Ireland .
The Queen 's University Belfast Series was first issued in 2003 .
This issue features a representation of Hibernia on the front , alongside shields of arms of the six counties of Northern Ireland .
The back of this note displays an image of Queen 's University Belfast .
In 2008 a new series featuring the image of the Old Bushmills Distillery on the reverse was introduced .
Apart from this change of rear design the difference between this note and the preceding series is minimal .
The design of the £ 5 note was tweaked in 2013 , with slight changes of the front design taking place .
The 2013 note also features an image of the Bushmills Distillery on the reverse .
