BY OFCOM
Section::::Censure by Ofcom .
Following the complaint of one viewer , the media regulator Ofcom found the BBC had breached Rule 1.28 of the Code in 2012 , specifically that there was a " serious lapse " in its duty of care for a 13-year - old actor , Gregory Piper , who had appeared in scenes which were " of a particularly violent nature and included sexually explicit language " by breaching broadcasting rules requiring that " due care must be taken over the physical and emotional welfare and the dignity of people under 18 " .
In its full report , Ofcom cited the programme 's failure to involve an independent expert , such as a child psychiatrist , to determine the actor 's intellectual and emotional capacity to participate in the controversial scenes and that programme makers had not followed the best practice advice of the BBC 's Editorial Policy Unit .
However , the regulator found that there was no actual harm , distress or anxiety caused to the child actor .
