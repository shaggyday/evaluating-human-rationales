Tatsumi receives Bulat 's Teigu , Incursio , as a result while Esdeath replaced her slain subordinates with a group of Teigu - using warriors called the Jaegers .
Night Raid , along with new recruits Susanoo ( a humanoid Teigu owned by Najenda ) and Chelsea , fight the Jaegers with Seryu , Wave , and Akame 's younger sister Kurome among its ranks .
Over time , the two factions gradually lose some of their members .
When the revolution gains momentum , Honest forms a new secret police force , the Wild Hunt , led by his own son , Syura .

After a battle between Wild Hunt and the Jaegers , with casualties from both sides , Esdeath blackmails Honest into dissolving the rest of Wild Hunt .
Syura is killed by Lubbock after he captures both him and Tatsumi .

Due to the stress he experienced while escaping the execution site , Tatsumi caused Incrusio to transform .
It would be revealed that Tatsumi caused the Danger Beast which Incrusio was created from , Tyrant , to awaken with the doctor

As this occurs , Night Raid confronts the last members of Wild Hunt and finish them off , with Akame taking out big generals on the Empire 's side .

However , Honest rigged the emperor 's Teigu to go berserk .
To confront the emperor 's Teigu , Tatsumi uses his last transformation to defeat it with Wave 's help while changing into Tyrant .
Before being fully consumed , Tatsumi asks Akame to kill him before he loses control and kills everyone .

so Tatsumi can live , managing to defeat the general at the cost of her own sword .
Esdeath acknowledges her loss and uses her power to commit suicide while regretting that she never got Tatsumi to return her feelings .

Kurome and Wave end up together as well , with the former still scarred by her past while the latter lost one of his internal organs as a price for using two Teigu at once .

CONCEPTION Section::::Conception .
In 2007 , Takahiro was asked to do a manga for Square Enix magazine .
He originally came up with the idea of an " all - female band of assassins , and the protagonist is a boy who is captured by them and has to work for them . "
After his editor approved the idea , he waited on serialization until his company had stabilized and had released two other titles , during which he developed the characters , story and world .
In August 2009 , following the release of Majikoi - Oh !
Samurai Girls , Takahiro looked for an artist for the serialization , and recruited Tetsuya Tashiro to do the illustrations .
He liked Tashiro 's ability to draw fast - paced action scenes and that he can draw cute girls .
In developing a chapter , Takahiro would write the script first and then have Tashiro determine the panel layout .
Takahiro would occasionally get feedback on plot ideas from Tashiro and the editor .
