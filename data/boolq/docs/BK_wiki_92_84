PLOT Section::::Plot .
In 1967 , a virus called Motaba , which causes a deadly fever , is discovered in the African jungle .
To keep the virus a secret , U.S. Army officers Donald McClintock and William Ford destroy the camp where soldiers were infected .
Twenty - eight years later , Colonel Sam Daniels , a USAMRIID virologist , is sent to investigate an outbreak in Zaire .
He and his crew — Lieutenant Colonel Casey Schuler and new recruit Major Salt — gather information and return to the United States .
Ford , now a brigadier general and Daniels ' superior officer , dismisses the latter 's fears that the virus will spread .
Betsy , a white - headed capuchin monkey that is host to the virus , is smuggled into the country .
James " Jimbo " Scott , a worker at an animal testing laboratory , is infected when he steals Betsy to sell on the black market .
Jimbo fails to sell Betsy to Rudy Alvarez , a pet - store owner in the California town of Cedar Creek .
After releasing the monkey in the woods of Palisades , he develops symptoms on a flight to Boston and infects his girlfriend , Alice .
Their illness is investigated by Dr. Roberta Keough , a CDC scientist and Daniels ' ex - wife .
Jimbo , Alice , and Rudy die , but Keough determines that no one else in Boston was infected .
A hospital technician in Cedar Creek is infected when he accidentally breaks the vial of Rudy 's blood .
The virus mutates into a strain capable of spreading like influenza , allowing a number of people to be infected in a movie theater .
Daniels flies to Cedar Creek against Ford 's orders , joining Keough 's team with Schuler and Salt .
As they begin a search for the monkey , the Army quarantines the town and imposes martial law .
Schuler is infected when his suit tears , and Keough accidentally sticks herself with a contaminated needle .
When Ford provides an experimental serum , Daniels realizes that he was aware of the virus before the outbreak .
He confronts Ford , who admits that the original Motaba strain was actually a military bioweapon ; the 1967 outbreak in Africa had in fact been a test - run of the virus , which subsequently infected the local monkey population despite Ford 's and McClintock 's attempt to halt its spread and cover up their actions .
Daniels learns about Operation Clean Sweep , a plan for the military to contain the virus by bombing Cedar Creek .
McClintock , now a major general , plans to use the operation to conceal the virus 's existence .
To prevent Daniels from finding a cure , McClintock orders him arrested for carrying the virus .
Daniels escapes , and he and Salt fly a helicopter to the ship which carried Betsy .
Daniels obtains a picture of Betsy and releases it to the media ; a Palisades resident , Mrs. Jeffries , realizes that her daughter Kate has been playing with Betsy in their yard and calls the CDC .
Daniels and Salt arrive at the Jeffries ' house , and Salt tranquilizes Betsy after Kate coaxes her out of hiding .
When he learns from Daniels about Betsy 's capture , Ford delays the bombing .
On their return flight , Daniels and Salt are chased by McClintock in another helicopter , and Salt fires two missiles into the trees to deceive him into thinking that they crashed .
In Cedar Creek , Salt mixes Betsy 's antibodies with Ford 's serum to create an antiserum ; although Schuler has died , they save Keough .
McClintock returns to base and resumes Operation Clean Sweep , refusing to listen to Ford .
Daniels and Salt fly a helicopter in the path of the bomber .
With Ford 's help , Daniels persuades the bomber 's flight crew to detonate the bomb over water and spare the town .
Before McClintock can order another bombing , Ford relieves him of command and orders his arrest .
Daniels and Keough reconcile , and Cedar Creek 's residents are cured .

Rita Kempley of The Washington Post also enjoyed the film 's plot : " Outbreak is an absolute hoot
thanks primarily to director Wolfgang Petersen 's rabid pacing and the great care he brings to setting up the story and its probability . "
David Denby wrote for New York magazine that although the opening scenes were well - done , " somewhere in the middle ...
Outbreak falls off a cliff " and becomes " lamely conventional " .
Janet Maslin of The New York Times also found the film 's subject compelling but its treatment ineffective : " The film 's shallowness also contributes to the impression that no problem is too thorny to be solved by movie heroics . "
