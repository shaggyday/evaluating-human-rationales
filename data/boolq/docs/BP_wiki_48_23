REAL IMAGE
In optics , a real image is an image which is located in the plane of convergence for the light rays that originate from a given object .
If a screen is placed in the plane of a real image the image will generally become visible on the screen .
Examples of real images include the image seen on a cinema screen ( the source being the projector ) , the image produced on a detector in the rear of a camera , and the image produced on an eyeball retina ( the camera and eye focus light through an internal convex lens ) .
In ray diagrams ( such as the images on the right ) , real rays of light are always represented by full , solid lines ; perceived or extrapolated rays of light are represented by dashed lines .
A real image occurs where rays converge , whereas a virtual image occurs where rays only appear to converge .
Real images can be produced by concave mirrors and converging lenses , only if the object is placed further away from the mirror / lens than the focal point and this real image is inverted .
As the object approaches the focal point the image approaches infinity , and when the object passes the focal point the image becomes virtual and is not inverted .
The distance is not the same as from the object to the lenses .
