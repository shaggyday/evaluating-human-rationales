THE FUEL Section::::The Fuel .
Historically called white gas ( not white spirit )
, it is a liquid petroleum fuel ( 100 % light hydrotreated distillate ) usually sold in one gallon cans in the United States , in Europe it is usually sold in one litre bottles .
USE Section::::Use .
Coleman fuel is used primarily for fueling lanterns and camp stoves .
Additionally , it is a popular fuel for fire dancing .
Originally , it was simply casing - head gas or drip gas which has similar properties .
Drip gas was sold commercially at gas stations and hardware stores in North America until the early 1950s .
The white gas sold today is a similar product but is produced at refineries and has a very low benzene content which is a human carcinogen .
Coleman fuel is a mixture of cyclohexane , nonane , octane , heptane , and pentane .
Though Coleman fuel has an octane rating of 50 to 55 and a flammability similar to gasoline , it has none of the additives found in modern gasoline .
Most burners will readily burn unleaded gasoline ( or white gas ) , however .
