BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD ASSOCIATION Blue Cross Blue Shield Association ( BCBSA ) is a federation of 36 separate United States health insurance organizations and companies , providing health insurance in the United States to more than 106 million people .
Blue Cross was founded in 1929 and became the Blue Cross Association in 1960 , while Blue Shield emerged in 1939 and the Blue Shield Association was created in 1948 .
The two organizations merged in 1982 .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Blue Cross and Blue Shield developed separately , with Blue Cross providing coverage for hospital services and Blue Shield covering physicians ' services .
Blue Cross is a name used by an association of health insurance plans throughout the United States .
Its predecessor was developed by Justin Ford Kimball in 1929 , while he was vice president of Baylor University 's health care facilities in Dallas , Texas .
The first plan guaranteed teachers 21 days of hospital care for $ 6 a year , and was later extended to other employee groups in Dallas , and then nationally .
The American Hospital Association ( AHA ) adopted the Blue Cross symbol in 1939 as the emblem for plans meeting certain standards .
In 1960 , the AHA commission was superseded by the Blue Cross Association .
Blue Cross severed its ties with the AHA in 1972 .
Blue Shield was developed by employers in lumber and mining camps of the Pacific Northwest to provide medical care by paying monthly fees to medical service bureaus composed of groups of physicians .
In 1939 , the first official Blue Shield plan was founded in California .
In 1948 , the symbol was informally adopted by nine plans called the Associated Medical Care Plan , and was later renamed the National Association of Blue Shield Plans .
In the 1960s the U.S. government chose to partner with Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies to administer Medicare .
In 1982 , Blue Shield merged with The Blue Cross Association to form the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association ( BCBS ) .
Prior to 1986 , organizations administering BCBS were tax exempt under 501(c)(4 ) as social welfare plans .
However , the Tax Reform Act of 1986 revoked the exemption , because the plans sold commercial - type insurance .
They became 501(m ) organizations , subject to federal taxation , but entitled to " special tax benefits " under IRC 833 .
In 1994 , BCBS changed to allow its licensees to be for - profit corporations .
During 2010 , Health Care Service Corporation , the parent company of BCBS in Texas , Oklahoma , New Mexico , Montana and Illinois , nearly doubled its income to $ 1.09 billion in 2010 , and began four years of billion - dollar profits .
In the final spending bill for FY 2015 after much lobbying since 2010 , nonprofit Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans continue to have special tax breaks that were understood to be threatened by the Affordable Care Act of 2010 .
CURRENT ORGANIZATION Section::::Current organization .
Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurance companies are licensees , independent of the association and traditionally of each other , offering insurance plans within defined regions under one or both of the association 's brands .
Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers offer some form of health insurance coverage in every U.S. state .
They also act as administrators of Medicare in many states or regions of the U.S. and provide coverage to state government employees as well as to the federal government employees under a nationwide option of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program .
The association has its headquarters in the Michigan Plaza complex in the Chicago Loop area of Chicago , Illinois .
