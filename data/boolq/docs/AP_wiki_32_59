HISTORY
1973–79 :
FORMATION AND EARLY RELEASES Section::::History .
Section::::1973–79 :
Formation and early releases . Vocalist and guitarist David Hidalgo and drummer Louie Pérez met at Garfield High School in East Los Angeles , California , and bonded over their mutual affinity for obscure musical acts such as Fairport Convention , Randy Newman and Ry Cooder .
Pérez recalls , " We 're looking at each other , ' You like this stuff ?
I thought I was the only weird one . '
So I went over to his house one day for about a year , which we spent listening to records , playing guitars , and starting to write songs .
"
The two borrowed reel - to - reel recorders from a friend and created multitrack recordings of music spanning from parody songs to free - form jazz .
They later enlisted fellow students Frank Gonzalez , Cesar Rosas and Conrad Lozano to complete the group 's lineup , in 1973 .
Their first album , Los Lobos del Este de Los Angeles , was recorded at two studios in Hollywood in 1977 over a period of about four months .
At that time , they all had regular jobs , and it was hard to get together for the sessions .
To accommodate that situation , their producer Louis Torres would call the engineer , Mark Fleisher , who owned and operated a high - speed tape duplicating studio in Hollywood , to find a studio when he knew all the band members could get off work that night .
Most of the songs were recorded at a studio on Melrose Avenue , located next to the Paramount studios at the time , and a low - priced studio on Sunset Boulevard .
The band members were unsatisfied with playing only American Top 40 songs and began experimenting with the traditional Mexican music they listened to as children .
This style of music received a positive reaction from audiences , leading the band to switch genres , performing at hundreds of weddings and dances between 1974 and 1980 .
However , Los Lobos took notice of the popular groups on the Hollywood music scene and added influences of rock to its sound .
Originally , they called themselves Los Lobos del Este ( de Los Angeles ) ( " The Wolves of the East [ of Los Angeles ) ] " ) , which was a play on the name of the norteño band Los Tigres del Norte ; also , there was another conjunto band at the time named " Los Lobos Del Norte " , who had released several albums already , and in fact Los Lobos del Este were from east L.A.
The name was quickly shortened to Los Lobos .
1980–88 : HOW WILL THE WOLF SURVIVE ?

and commercial success .
The band 's first noteworthy public appearance occurred in 1980 at the Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles , when they were hired by David Ferguson and CD Presents to open for
Public Image Ltd. In 1983 , the band released an extended play entitled ...
And a Time to Dance , which was well received by critics but sold only about 50,000 copies .
However , the sales of the EP earned the group enough money to purchase a Dodge van , enabling the band to tour throughout the United States for the first time .
Los Lobos returned to the studio in the summer of 1984 to record its first major - label album , How Will the Wolf Survive ? , in 1984 .
The album 's title and the title song were inspired by a National Geographic article entitled " Where Can the Wolf Survive " , which the band members related to their own struggle to gain success in the United States while maintaining their Mexican roots .
The film Colors includes " One Time , One Night " in the opening credits , although the song was not included on the soundtrack album .
In 1986 , members of Los Lobos appeared alongside Tomata du Plenty in the punk rock musical .
In 1987 , they released a second album , By the Light of the Moon .
In the same year , they recorded some Ritchie Valens covers for the soundtrack of the film La Bamba , including the title track , which became a number one single for the band .
