WEST INDIES
The West Indies is a region of the North Atlantic Ocean in the Caribbean that includes the island countries and surrounding waters of three major archipelagos : the Greater Antilles , the Lesser Antilles and the Lucayan Archipelago .
The region is known as the area running from Florida westward along the Gulf Coast , and then south along the Mexican coast through Central America and then eastward across the northern coast of South America .
Indigenous peoples were the first inhabitants of the West Indies .
In 1492 , Christopher Columbus became the first European to arrive at the islands , where he is believed by historians to have first set foot on land in the Bahamas .
After the first of the voyages of Christopher Columbus to the Americas , Europeans began to use the term West Indies to distinguish the region from the East Indies of South Asia and Southeast Asia .
HISTORY Section::::History .
In late sixteenth century , French , English and Dutch merchants and privateers began their operations in the Caribbean Sea , attacking Spanish and Portuguese shipping and coastal areas .
They often took refuge and refitted their ships in the areas the Spanish could not conquer , including the islands of the Lesser Antilles , the northern coast of South America including the mouth of the Orinoco , and the Atlantic Coast of Central America .
In the Lesser Antilles they managed to establish a foothold following the colonisation of St Kitts in 1624 and Barbados in 1626 , and when the Sugar Revolution took off in the mid - seventeenth century , they brought in thousands of Africans to work the fields and mills as slave labourers .
These Africans wrought a demographic revolution , replacing or joining with either the indigenous Caribs or the European settlers who were there as indentured servants .
The struggle between the northern Europeans and the Spanish spread southward in the mid to late seventeenth century , as English , Dutch , French and Spanish colonists , and in many cases their slaves from Africa first entered and then occupied the coast of The Guianas ( which fell to the French , English and Dutch ) and the Orinoco valley , which fell to the Spanish .
The Dutch , allied with the Caribs of the Orinoco , would eventually carry the struggles deep into South America , first along the Orinoco and then along the northern reaches of the Amazon .
Since no European country had occupied much of Central America , gradually the English of Jamaica established alliances with the Miskito Kingdom of modern - day Nicaragua and Honduras , and then began logging on the coast of modern - day Belize .
These interconnected commercial and diplomatic relations made up the Western Caribbean Zone which was in place in the early eighteenth century .
In the Miskito Kingdom , the rise to power of the Miskito - Zambos , who originated in the survivors of a rebellion aboard a slave ship in the 1640s and the introduction of African slaves by British settlers within the Miskito area and in Belize , also transformed this area into one with a high percentage of persons of African descent as was found in most of the rest of the Caribbean .
From the 17th through the 19th century , the European colonial territories of the West Indies were the French West Indies , British West Indies , the Danish West Indies , the Netherlands Antilles ( Dutch West Indies ) , and the Spanish West Indies .
In 1916 , Denmark sold the Danish West Indies to the United States for US$ 25 million in gold , per the Treaty of the Danish West Indies .
The Danish West Indies became an insular area of the U.S. , called the United States Virgin Islands .
Between 1958 and 1962 , the United Kingdom re - organised all their West Indies island territories ( except the British Virgin Islands and the Bahamas ) into the West Indies Federation .
They hoped that the Federation would coalesce into a single , independent nation .
However , the Federation had limited powers , numerous practical problems , and a lack of popular support ; consequently , it was dissolved by the British in 1963 , with nine provinces eventually becoming independent sovereign states and four becoming current British Overseas Territories .
West Indies or West India was the namesake of several companies of the 17th and 18th centuries , including the Danish West India Company , the Dutch West India Company , the French West India Company , and the Swedish West India Company .
West Indian is the official term used by the U.S. government to refer to people of the West Indies .
USE OF THE TERM Section::::Use of the term .
Tulane University professor Rosanne Adderly says : [ T]he phrase " West Indies " distinguished the territories encountered by Columbus or and claimed by Spain from discovery claims by other powers in [ Asia 's ] " East Indies " ...
The term " West Indies " was eventually used by all European nations to describe their own acquired territories in the Americas ... considering British Caribbean colonies collectively as the " West Indies " had its greatest political importance in the 1950s with the movement to create a federation of those colonies that could ultimately become an independent nation ...
Despite the collapse of the Federation [ in the early 1960s ] ...
the West Indies continues to field a joint cricket team for international competition .
Despite the clarification that they are not actually part of India , the term stuck , primarily for British imperialistic reasons .
The West Indies cricket team includes participants from Guyana , which is geographically located in South America .
