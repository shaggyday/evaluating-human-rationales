Section::::Other teams .
Prior to 1886 , teams played .700 ball or better over shorter schedules , where there is much less of the " evening out " effect of a lengthier season .
For example , the Chicago White Stockings won the National League 's first pennant in 1876 with a 52–14 record ( .788 ) , and won the 1880 NL pennant with a 67–17 record ( .798 ) , which stands as the overall percentage record between the National or the American League .
The White Stockings ' 1880 record would project to a record of 129–33 under the modern schedule of 162 games , while Pythagorean expectation based on the White Stockings ' results ( 538 runs scored , 317 runs allowed ) and a 162-game schedule would translate to a record of 120–42 .
The all - time best single season record belongs to the Cincinnati Red Stockings , who posted baseball 's only perfect record at 67–0 ( 57–0 against National Association of Base Ball Players clubs ) in 1869 .
Their record would stretch to 81–0 across the 1870 season before losing 8–7 in eleven innings to the Brooklyn Atlantics in Brooklyn on June 14 .
The second - best record belongs to the 1875 Boston Red Stockings of the National Association , who finished with a record of 71–8 ( .899 ) , but the status of the National Association as a major league has long been disputed .
The Red Stockings record would project to 146–16 under the modern schedule of 162 games , while Pythagorean expectation based on the Red Stockings results ( 831 runs scored , 343 runs allowed ) and the modern 162-game schedule would translate to a record of 138–24 .
The National Association folded at the end of 1875 , and the Red Stockings , who had won the last four pennants , joined the National League for 1876 , being renamed the Red Caps .
The team went 39–31 for a fourth - place finish in 1876 before winning the 1877 and 1878 pennants with records of 42–18 and 41–19 .
The third - best record belongs to the St. Louis Maroons of the 1884 Union Association , who finished with a record of 94–19 ( .832 ) , but the Union Association was quite lopsided in talent distribution ( team owner Henry Lucas was also league president , an obvious conflict - of - interest situation which is now banned , and bought all the best available players for his franchise ) , generally disorganized ( six teams played close to full schedules , another four teams folded and one relocated during the course of the season ) , and poorly scheduled .
The Maroons ' record would project to 135–27 under the modern schedule of 162 games , while Pythagorean expectation based on the Maroons ' results ( 887 runs scored , 429 runs allowed ) and a 162-game schedule would translate to a record of 131–31 , but these results are of questionable merit .
The Union Association folded at the end of 1884 , and the Maroons joined the National League for 1885 .
Playing against stiffer competition , they went 36–72 in 1885 , and 43–79 in 1886 , finishing in last and sixth in both seasons .
In 1887 , the Maroons relocated to Indianapolis and became the Indianapolis Hoosiers , playing three more seasons below .500 before folding .
