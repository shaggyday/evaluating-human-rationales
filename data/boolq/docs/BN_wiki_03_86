SHELL V - POWER Shell V - Power is the brand name given to Shell 's enhanced high specification fuels for road motor vehicles including Shell V - Power Nitro+ and Shell V - Power Diesel .
Shell launched the fuel in March 2008 under the name Nitrogen - Enriched Shell V - Power , with nitrogen - containing detergents .
Initially used for higher octane Super Unleaded petrol / gasoline ( formerly known as Optimax in some regions ) , it is now additionally used for high specification diesel fuel .
V - POWER
PETROL Section::::V - Power petrol .
Petrol or gasoline is assessed , categorised and sold by an octane rating .
Generally , in most areas of the world , the Research Octane Number ( RON ) is used , but in North America , the Anti - Knock Index ( AKI ) is used .
Conventional ' standard ' " Super Unleaded " petrol in Europe , South Asia and Australia has an octane rating of 95 RON , and in North America " Premium Unleaded " is AKI / RdON / PON 91 - 93 ( RON 96â€“98 ) .
However , higher octane " Super Plus Unleaded " - often formulated with higher quality additives , is usually set at around 98 RON in mainland Europe ; but this can vary by market .
Most oil / petroleum companies now ' market ' their own Super Plus Unleaded petrols under a unique name - and
the current name for Shell Super Unleaded fuel is " V - Power " .
Like most Super Plus Unleaded petrols , V - Power also contains higher concentrations of detergents and other additives to help clean the engine and smooth its operation .
In the United Kingdom and Denmark ( where Super Plus Unleaded must be a minimum of 97 RON ) , V - Power has a rating of 99 RON ( whereas V - Power 's predecessor Shell Optimax was rated at 98 RON ) .
There are two other 99 RON fuel available in the UK , namely Tesco MOMENTUM99 and more recently Costco Premium Unleaded ( 99 RON ) .
In The Netherlands , V - Power used to have a 95 RON rating , although officials from Shell stated it effectively had a 97 RON rating .
Due to the limited categories of 92 RON , 95 RON , 98 RON and 100 RON . , it was officially rated at 95 .
These days , the RON rating of the V - power petrol in the Netherlands is rated at 98 .
In Germany , all Shell stations offer V - Power Racing 100 , rated at 100 RON .
In Greece , all Shell stations offer V - Power rated at 97 RON .

In Australia , from October 2006 , Shell and Coles Express re - branded Optimax to V - Power ( 98 RON ) .
V - Power Racing , the ultra - high performance variant has a rating of 100 RON although Shell have decided to phase out V - Power Racing from 21 July to mid August 2008 , instead recommending V - Power .
The previously obtainable higher grade V - Power Racing which contained 5 % ethanol to boost V - Power 's octane rating to 100 RON has now been phased out by Shell due to a " changing market " .
In the United States ( U.S. ) , at around 2004 , all U.S. Shell " Premium " gas was rebranded as " V - Power " .

In Hong Kong , as there is no oil refinery plant located in Hong Kong , Gasoline was imported from Singapore , which is 98 RON .
However , V - Power sold in gas stations rumored reach 167 RON ( the highest native RON for consumer grade commercial petrol across worldwide ) .
Such figure is not supported by actual test , nor is it confirmed by Shell and which is contradicted from a reading material for Legislators of Legislative Council .
In New Zealand , from 2007 , Shell rebranded 95 Premium Unleaded as V - Power .
It was still rated at 95 RON .

V - POWER DIESEL Section::::V - Power Diesel .
V - Power Diesel is Shell 's version of an enhanced diesel fuel , similar , say to BPs ' Ultimate Diesel ' .
Like BP Ultimate Diesel , Shell V - Power Diesel is designed for modern compression - ignition diesel engines , to facilitate enhanced engine performance along with increased engine protection , for more consistent operation and engine longevity .
One characteristic of V - Power diesel is that it is a lot clearer and odourless than normal diesel , mainly due to the synthetic GTL component .
The fuel is slightly less dense than regular diesel so , per volume , the unit energy is actually lower than regular diesel .
This is offset , as the fuel tends to ignite more readily ( and thus has a higher cetane rating ) than regular diesel , and a side benefit of this is that it tends to produce less soot during combustion .
Shell also markets a different " premium " diesel in Canada labeled V - Power , which they state " Is specially formulated for year - round Canadian weather conditions , with a cetane improver , a de - icer and a corrosion inhibitor . " .
This Canadian V - Power diesel is dispensed from a dedicated pump that injects a measured amount of NEMO 2061 additive into the diesel supply shared with the other diesel pumps at the service station .
As a result , it contains no GTL components beyond those that may already exist in the shared diesel supply .
Effective June 1 , 2012 , Pilipinas Shell launches the new premium diesel fuel grade , Shell V - Power Nitro+ Diesel ( formerly Shell V - Power Diesel )
