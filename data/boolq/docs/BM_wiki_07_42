FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT
The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) , 15 U.S.C. § 1681 , is U.S. Federal Government legislation enacted to promote the accuracy , fairness , and privacy of consumer information contained in the files of consumer reporting agencies .
It was intended to protect consumers from the willful and/or negligent inclusion of inaccurate information in their credit reports .
To that end , the FCRA regulates the collection , dissemination , and use of consumer information , including consumer credit information .
Together with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) , the FCRA forms the foundation of consumer rights law in the United States .
It was originally passed in 1970 , and is enforced by the US Federal Trade Commission , the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and private litigants .

It was written as an amendment to add a title VI to the Consumer Credit Protection Act , .
The Fair Credit Reporting Act was one of the first instances of data protection law passed in the computer age .
The findings of the U.S. Congress that led to the Act , and the Act 's key regulatory innovations , set the direction of information privacy in the U.S. and the world for the next fifty years .
Key among these innovations was the determination that there should be no secret databases that are used to make decisions about a person 's life , that individuals should have a right to see and challenge the information held in such databases , and that information in such a database should expire after a reasonable amount of time .

CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES ( CRAS )
Section::::Consumer reporting agencies ( CRAs ) .
Consumer reporting agencies ( CRAs ) are entities that collect and disseminate information about consumers to be used for credit evaluation and certain other purposes , including employment .
Credit bureaus , a type of consumer reporting agency , hold a consumer 's credit report in their databases .
CRAs have a number of responsibilities under FCRA , including the following : * CRAs must maintain reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information contained within a consumer 's report ;

The three big CRAs — Experian , TransUnion , and Equifax — do not interact with information furnishers directly as a result of consumer disputes .
They use a system called E - Oscar .
In some areas of the country , however , there are other credit bureaus .
NATIONWIDE SPECIALTY CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES Section::::Nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies .
In addition to the three big CRAs , the FCRA also classifies dozens of other information technology companies as " nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies " that produce individual consumer reports used to make credit determinations .
Under Section 603 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act , the term " nationwide specialty consumer reporting agency " means a consumer reporting agency that compiles and maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis relating to : * Medical records or payments ;
*
* Residential or tenant history ;
* * Check writing history ;
*
* Employment history ; or ,
* * Insurance claims .
* Because these nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies sell consumer credit report files , they are required to provide annual disclosures of their report files to any consumer who requests disclosure .
A partial list of companies classified as nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies under FCRA includes : Telecheck , ChoicePoint , Acxiom , Integrated Screening Partners , Innovis , the Insurance Services Office , Tenant Data Services , LexisNexis , Retail Equation , Central Credit , Teletrack , the MIB Group , United Health Group ( Ingenix Division ) , and Milliman .
Although the major CRAs Experian , Equifax , and TransUnion are required by law to provide a central source website for consumers to request their reports , the nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies are not required to provide a centralized online source for disclosure .
The FCRA Section 612 merely requires nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies to establish a streamlined process for consumers to request consumer reports , which shall include , at a minimum , the establishment by each such agency of a toll - free telephone number for such consumer disclosure requests .
