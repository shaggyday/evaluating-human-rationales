WORDS PER MINUTE Words per minute , commonly abbreviated wpm ( sometimes uppercased WPM )
, is a measure of words processed in a minute , often used as a measurement of the speed of typing , reading or Morse code sending and receiving .
ALPHANUMERIC ENTRY Section::::Alphanumeric entry .
Since the length or duration of words is clearly variable , for the purpose of measurement of text entry , the definition of each " word " is often standardized to be five characters or keystrokes long in English , including spaces and punctuation .
For example , under such a method applied to plain English text
the phrase
" I run " counts as one word , but " rhinoceros " and " let 's talk " would both count as two .
Brandon Raziano found that one study of average computer users in 1997 , the average rate for transcription was 33 words per minute , and 19 words per minute for composition .
In the same study , when the group was divided into " fast " , " moderate " , and " slow " groups , the average speeds were 40 wpm , 35 wpm , and 23 wpm , respectively .
With the onset of the era of desktop computers , fast typing skills became much more widespread .
An average professional typist types usually in speeds of 50 to 80 wpm , while some positions can require 80 to 95 ( usually the minimum required for dispatch positions and other time - sensitive typing jobs ) , and some advanced typists work at speeds above 120 wpm .
Two - finger typists , sometimes also referred to as " hunt and peck " typists , commonly reach sustained speeds of about 37 wpm for memorized text and 27 wpm when copying text , but in bursts may be able to reach much higher speeds .
From the 1920s through the 1970s , typing speed ( along with shorthand speed ) was an important secretarial qualification and typing contests were popular and often publicized by typewriter companies as promotional tools .
STENOTYPE
Section::::Stenotype .
Stenotype keyboards enable the trained user to input text as fast as 225 wpm or faster at very high accuracy for an extended period of time , which is sufficient for real - time activities such as court reporting or closed captioning .
While dropout rates are very high — in some cases , only 10 % or even less graduate — stenotype students are usually able to reach speeds of 100–120 wpm within six months , which is faster than most alphanumeric typists .
Guinness World Records gives 360 wpm with 97.23 % accuracy as the highest achieved speed using a stenotype .
NUMERIC ENTRY Section::::Numeric entry .
The numeric entry or 10 key speed is a measure of one 's ability to manipulate the numeric keypad found on most modern separate computer keyboards .
It is used to measure speed for jobs such as data entry of number information on items such as remittance advice , bills , or checks , as deposited to lock boxes .
It is measured in " Keystrokes per hour , " or KPH .
Many jobs require a certain KPH , often 8,000 or 10,000 .
HANDWRITING
Section::::Handwriting .
For an adult population ( age range 18–64 )
the average speed of copying is 68 letters per minute ( approximately 13 wpm ) , with the range from a minimum of 26 to a maximum of 113 letters per minute ( approximately 5 to 20 wpm ) .
A study of police interview records showed that the highest speed fell in the range 120–155 characters per minute , the highest possible limit being 190 characters per minute .
According to various studies the speed of handwriting of 3–7 graders varies from 25 to 94 letters per minute .
Using stenography ( shorthand ) methods , this rate increases greatly .
Handwriting speeds up to 350 words per minute have been achieved in shorthand competitions .
READING AND COMPREHENSION Section::::Reading and comprehension .
Words per minute is a common metric for assessing reading speed and is often used in the context of remedial skills evaluation , as well as in the context of speed reading , where it is a controversial measure of reading performance .
A word in this context is the same as in the context of speech .
Research done in 2012 measured the speed at which subjects read a text aloud , and found the average speed across 17 different languages to be 184±29 wpm or 863±234 characters per minute .
However , for the languages that use the Latin or Cyrillic alphabets , the number of wpm varied , as low as 161±18 for Finnish and as high as 228±30 for English .
The reason for this is different word structures in each language ( longer words in such languages as Finnish and shorter words in English ) .
However , the number of characters per minute tends to be around 1000 for all the tested languages .
For the tested Asian languages that use particular writing systems ( Arabic , Hebrew , Chinese , Japanese )
these numbers are lower .
Scientific studies have demonstrated that reading — defined here as capturing and decoding all the words on every page — faster than 900 wpm is not feasible given the limits set by the anatomy of the eye .
While proofreading materials , people are able to read English at 200 wpm on paper , and 180 wpm on a monitor .
[ Those numbers from Ziefle , 1998 , are for studies that used monitors prior to 1992 .
See Noyes & Garland 2008 for a modern tech view of equivalence . ]
SPEECH AND LISTENING Section::::Speech and listening .
Audiobooks are recommended to be 150–160 words per minute , which is the range that people comfortably hear and vocalize words .
Slide presentations tend to be closer to 100–125 wpm for a comfortable pace , auctioneers can speak at about 250 wpm , and the fastest speaking policy debaters speak from 350 to over 500 words per minute .
Internet speech calculators show that various things influence words per minute including nervousness .
John Moschitta , Jr. , was listed in Guinness World Records , for a time , as the world 's fastest speaker , being able to talk at 586 wpm .
He has since been surpassed by Steve Woodmore , who achieved a rate of 637 wpm .
MORSE CODE
Section::::Morse code .
Morse code uses variable length sequences of short and long duration signals ( dots and dashes ) to represent source information e.g. sequences for the letter " K " and numeral " 2 " are respectively ( ) and ( ) .
This variability complicates the measurement of Morse code speed rated in words per minute .
Using telegram messages , the average English word length is about five characters , each averaging 5.124 dot durations or baud .
Spacing between words should also be considered , being seven dot durations in the USA and five in British territories .
So the average British telegraph word was 30.67 dot times .
So the baud rate of a Morse code is × word per minute rate .
It is standard practice to use two different such standard words to measure Morse code speeds in words per minute .
The standard words are : " PARIS " and " CODEX " .
In Morse code " PARIS " has 50 dot durations , while " CODEX " has 60 .
Morse is still widely used by amateur radio operators ( hams ) .
Experienced hams routinely send Morse at 20 words per minute , using manually operated hand telegraph keys ; enthusiasts such as members of The CW Operators ' Club routinely send and receive Morse code at speeds up to 60 wpm .
Twenty words per minute ( 20 wpm ) represents the rough upper limit for Morse operators attempting to write down Morse code received by ear using paper and pencil .
Many skilled Morse code operators can receive Morse code by ear mentally without writing down the information at speeds up to 70 wpm .
To write down the Morse code information manually at speeds
higher than 20 wpm it is usual for the operators to use a typewriter or computer keyboard to enable higher speed copying .
The fastest Morse code operator was Theodore Roosevelt McElroy copying at 75.6 wpm using a typewriter at the 1939 world championship .
