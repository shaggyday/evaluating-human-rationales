Nationality WINNING MARGIN
Section::::Winning margin .
In the early years of the Tour , cyclists rode individually , and were sometimes forbidden to ride together .
This led to large gaps between the winner and the number two .
Since the cyclists now tend to stay together in a peloton , the margins of the winner have become smaller , as the difference usually originates from time trials , breakaways or on mountain top finishes , or from being left behind the peloton .
In the table below , the nine smallest margins between the winner and the second placed cyclists at the end of the Tour are given .
The largest margin , by comparison , remains that of the first Tour in 1903 :
2h 49 m 45s between Maurice Garin and Lucien Pothier .
The nine smallest margins between first and second placed riders are as follows : !
