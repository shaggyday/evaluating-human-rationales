WORLD 'S FAIR A world 's fair , world fair , world expo , universal exposition , or international exposition ( sometimes expo or Expo for short ) is a large international exhibition designed to showcase achievements of nations .
These exhibitions vary in character and are held in different parts of the world .
The most recent international exhibition , Expo 2017 , was held in Astana , Kazakhstan .
Osaka in Japan has been selected to host World Expo 2025 .
Since the 1928 Convention Relating to International Exhibitions came into force , the Bureau International des Expositions ( BIE ; ) has served as an international sanctioning body for world 's fairs .
Four types of international exhibition are organised under the auspices of the BIE : World Expos , Specialized Expos , Horticultural Expos ( regulated by the International Association of Horticultural Producers ) and the Triennale di Milano .
Depending on their category , international exhibitions may last from three weeks to six months .
HISTORY Section::::History .
World 's fairs originated in the French tradition of national exhibitions , a tradition that culminated with the French Industrial Exposition of 1844 held in Paris .
This fair was followed by other national exhibitions in continental Europe and the United Kingdom .
The best - known ' first World Expo ' was held in The Crystal Palace in Hyde Park , London , United Kingdom , in 1851 , under the title " Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations " .
The Great Exhibition , as it is often called , was an idea of Prince Albert , Queen Victoria 's husband , and is usually considered to be the first international exhibition of manufactured products .
It influenced the development of several aspects of society , including art - and - design education , international trade and relations , and tourism .
These events have resulted in a remarkable form of Prince Albert 's life history , one that continues to be reflected in London architecture in a number of ways , including in the Albert Memorial later erected to the Prince .
This expo was the most obvious precedent for the many international exhibitions , later called world 's fairs , that have continued to be held to the present time .
Since their inception in 1851 , the character of World Expos has evolved .
Three eras can be distinguished : the era of industrialization , the era of cultural exchange , and the era of nation branding .
INDUSTRIALIZATION ( 1851–1938 ) Section::::Industrialization ( 1851–1938 ) .
The first era could be called the era of " industrialization " and covered , roughly , the period from 1800 to 1938 .
In these days , world expositions were especially focused on trade , and were famous for the display of technological inventions and advancements .
World expositions were the platforms where the state - of - the - art in science and technology from around the world were brought together .
The world expositions of 1851 London , 1853 New York , 1862 London , 1876 Philadelphia , 1889 Paris , 1893 Chicago , 1897 Brussels , 1900 Paris , 1901 Buffalo , 1904 St. Louis , 1915 San Francisco , and 1933–34 Chicago were landmarks in this respect .
Inventions such as the telephone were first presented during this era .
An important part of the image of world 's fairs stems from this first era .
CULTURAL EXCHANGE ( 1939–1987 )
Section::::Cultural exchange ( 1939–1987 ) .
The 1939–40 New York World 's Fair diverged from the original focus of the world 's fair expositions .
From then on , world 's fairs adopted specific cultural themes ; they forecast a better future for society .
Technological innovations were no longer the primary exhibits at fairs .
The theme of the 1939 fair was " Building the World of Tomorrow " ; at the 1964–65 New York World 's Fair , it was " Peace Through Understanding " ; at the 1967 International and Universal Exposition in Montreal , it was " Man and His World " .
The fairs encouraged effective intercultural communication for the exchange of innovation .
The 1967 International and Universal Exposition in Montreal was promoted under the name Expo 67 .
Event organizers retired the term world 's fair in favor of Expo .
( The Montreal Expos , a former Major League Baseball team , was named for the 1967 fair . )
NATION BRANDING ( 1988–PRESENT )
Section::::Nation branding ( 1988–present ) .
From World Expo 88 in Brisbane onwards , countries started to use expos more widely and more strongly as a platform to improve their national images through their pavilions .
Finland , Japan , Canada , France , and Spain are cases in point .
A large study by Tjaco Walvis called " Expo 2000 Hanover in Numbers " showed that improving national image was the primary participation goal for 73 % of the countries at Expo 2000 .
In a world where a strong national image is a key asset , pavilions became advertising campaigns , and the Expo a vehicle for " nation branding " .
Apart from cultural and symbolic reasons , organizing countries ( and the cities and regions hosting them ) also utilize the world exposition to brand themselves .
According to branding expert Wally Olins , Spain used Expo ' 92 and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona in the same year to underline its new position as a modern and democratic country and present itself as a prominent member of the European Union and the global community .
At Expo 2000
Hannover , where countries created their own architecture , the average pavilion investment was about € 12 million .
Given these costs , governments are sometimes hesitant to participate , because benefits are often assumed not to outweigh the costs .
Tangible effects are difficult to measure , but an independent study for the Dutch pavilion at Expo 2000 estimated that the pavilion ( which cost around € 35 million ) generated around € 350 million of potential revenues for the Dutch economy .
It also identified several key success factors for world - exposition pavilions in general .
TYPES Section::::Types .
Presently , there are two types of international exhibition : World Expos ( formally known as International Registered Exhibitions ) and Specialised Expos ( formally known as International Recognised Exhibitions ) .
World Expos , previously known as universal expositions , are the biggest category events .
At World Expos , participants generally build their own pavilions .
They are therefore the most extravagant and most expensive expos .
Their duration may be between six weeks and six months .
Since 1995 , the interval between two World Expos has been at least five years .
The latest World Expo Expo 2015 was held in Milan , Italy , from 1 May to 31 October 2015 .
Specialized Expos are smaller in scope and investments and generally shorter in duration ; between three weeks and three months .
Previously , these Expos were called Special Exhibitions or International Specialized Exhibitions but these terms are no longer used officially .
Their total surface area must not exceed 25 ha and organizers must build pavilions for the participating states , free of rent , charges , taxes and expenses .
The largest country pavilions may not exceed 1,000 m.
Only one Specialised Expo can be held between two World Expos .
An additional two types of international exhibition may be recognized by the BIE : horticultural exhibitions , which are joint BIE and AIPH - sanctioned ' garden ' fairs in which participants present gardens and garden pavilions ; and the semi - regular Milan Triennial ( not always held every third year ) art and design exhibition , held in Milan , Italy , with the BIE granting official international exhibition status to 14 editions of the Triennale between 1996 and 2016 .
WORLD
EXPOS Section::::World Expos .
World Expos ( formally known as International Registered Exhibitions ) encompass universal themes that affect the full gamut of human experience , and international and corporate participants are required to adhere to the theme in their representations .
Registered expositions are held every 5 years because they are more expensive as they require total design of pavilion buildings from the ground up .
As a result , nations compete for the most outstanding or memorable structure — recent examples include Japan , France , Morocco , and Spain at Expo ' 92 .
Recent Registered Expositions include Brussels Expo ' 58 , Montreal Expo 67 , Vancouver Expo 86 , Osaka Expo ' 70 , and Seville Expo ' 92 .
Sometimes prefabricated structures are also used to minimize costs for developing countries or for countries from a geographical block to share space ( i.e. Plaza of the Americas at Seville ' 92 ) .
The only Registered ( Universal ) exposition to be held without BIE approval was the 1964–1965 New York World 's Fair .
The sanctioning organization at Paris denied them " official " status because its president , Robert Moses , did not comply with BIE rules in place at the time , namely the one limiting the duration for universal expositions to six months only .
The two World 's Fairs in New York ( 1939–40 and 1964–65 ) and the Century of Progress in Chicago ( 1934 - 1935 ) have the distinction of being the only two - year world expositions in history .
The Fair proceeded without BIE approval and turned to tourism and trade organizations to host national pavilions in lieu of official government sponsorship .
However , a large number of countries did participate in the world 's fair including several newly independent African and Asian states .
Frederick Pittera , a producer of international fairs and exhibitions and author of the history of world 's fairs in the Encyclopædia Britannica and Compton Encyclopedia , was commissioned by Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. of New York City in 1959 to prepare the first feasibility studies for the 1964 New York World 's Fair .
Pittera was joined in his study by Austrian architect Victor Gruen ( Inventor of the ' Shopping Mall ' ) .
The Eisenhower Commission ultimately awarded the world 's fair bid to New York City against several major U.S. cities .
In the 21st century the BIE has moved to sanction expos only every five years ; following the numerous expos of the 1980s and 1990s , some see this as a means to cut down potential expenditure by participating nations .
The move was also seen by some as an attempt to avoid conflicting with the Summer Olympics .
The rule may apply to all expos , or it may end up that universal expositions will be restricted to every five years or so , with international or specialized expositions in the in - between years for countries wishing to celebrate a special event .
The most recent universal expo was Expo 2017 in Astana .
SPECIALISED
EXPOS Section::::Specialised Expos .
Specialized Expos ( formally known as International Recognized Exhibitions ) are usually united by a precise theme — such as ' Future Energy ' ( Expo 2017 Astana ) , ' The Living Ocean and Cost ' ( Expo 2012 Yeosu , or ' Leisure in the Age of Technology ' ( Brisbane , Expo ' 88 ) .
Such themes are more specific than the wider scope of world expositions .
The Specialized Exposition , Tsukuba , Japan , popularly known as Expo ' 85 was held in the city of Tsukuba located near Tokyo .
This Exposition is more formally known as " The International Science Technology Exposition " .
Specialized Expos are usually smaller in scale and cheaper to run for the host committee and participants because the architectural fees are lower and they only have to customize pavilion space provided free of charge from the Organiser , usually with the prefabricated structure already completed .
Countries then have the option of ' adding ' their own colours , design etc .
to the outside of the prefabricated structure and filling in the inside with their own content .

LEGACY
Section::::Legacy .
The majority of the structures are temporary and are dismantled after the fair closes .
Landmark towers from several fairs are notable exceptions .
By far the most famous of these is the Eiffel Tower , built for the Exposition Universelle ( 1889 ) .
Although it is now the most recognized symbol of its host city Paris , a number of influential contemporary critics opposed its construction , and there were demands for it to be dismantled after the fair 's conclusion .
Other major structures that were held over from these fairs :
* 1851-London : The Crystal Palace , from the first World 's Fair in London , designed so that it could be recycled to recoup losses , was such a success that it was moved and intended to be permanent , only to be destroyed by a fire in 1936 .
* 1876-Philadelphia : The Centennial Exposition 's main building , Memorial Hall , is still in Fairmount Park , Philadelphia , and serving as the new home for the Please Touch Museum .
The space under the entrance to Memorial Hall houses a scale model of the entire Exposition .
* 1880-Melbourne : The World Heritage - listed Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne , constructed for the Melbourne International Exhibition .
* 1893-Chicago : The Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago is housed in the former Palace of Fine Arts , one of the last remaining buildings of the World 's Columbian Exposition .
In conjunction with the fair , the Art Institute of Chicago building was built to house conferences , as the World 's Congress Auxiliary Building .
The intent or hope was to make all Columbian structures permanent , but most of the structures burned , possibly the result of arson during the Pullman Strike .
The foundation of the world 's first Ferris wheel , which operated at the Exposition , was unearthed on the Chicago Midway during a construction project by the University of Chicago , whose campus now surrounds the Midway .
Relocated survivors include the Norway pavilion , a small house now at a museum in Wisconsin , and the Maine State Building , now at the Poland Springs Resort in Maine .
* 1894-San Francisco : The Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco 's Golden Gate Park is the last major remnant of the California Midwinter International Exposition .
Large ornamental wooden gates and a pagoda from the 1915 Panama - Pacific International Exposition were brought in after the latter fair closed , making the Tea Garden a rare if not
unique instance of a survivor that incorporates architectural features from two completely separate fairs .
* 1897-Nashville :
A full - scale replica of the Parthenon was built for the Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition where it stands today in Nashville 's Centennial Park .
It features plaster reproductions of the Elgin Marbles and , in 1990 , a re - creation of the original Athena Parthenos statue was installed inside just as it was in the original Parthenon in ancient Greece .
* 1900-Paris : the Grand Palais and Petit Palais .
* 1901-Buffalo :
The New York State pavilion at the Pan - American Exposition remains today as the home of the Buffalo History Museum , and is set on grounds originally laid out by Frederick Law Olmsted .
Across the man - made lake on the Scajaquada Creek is the Albright – Knox Art Gallery , originally intended as the Beaux Arts Exhibition Hall , but not completed in time for the exhibition .
* 1904-St .
Louis :
The St. Louis Art Museum in Forest Park , originally the Palace of the Fine Arts , and Brookings Hall at Washington University in St. Louis , are remnants of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition ( held a year late , as it was originally intended to be the centennial of the Louisiana Purchase .
But organizers , and President [ [ Theodore Roosevelt , wanted the fair to be held during the Olympics which were moved from Chicago . ) , better known as the St. Louis World 's Fair .
The aviary in Forest Park gave root to the [ [ St . Louis Zoo ] ] .
* 1906-Milan :
The [ [ Civic Aquarium of Milan ] ]
built for the [ [ Milan International ( 1906)Milan Exposition ] ] is still open after 100 years and was recently renovated .
The [ [ International Commission on Occupational Health ] ]
( ICOH ) was settled in Milan during the fair and had its first congress in the Expo pavilions .
In June 2006 the ICOH celebrated the first century of its life in Milan .
An elevated railway with trains running at short intervals linked the fair to the city center .
It was dismantled in the 1920s .
* 1909-Seattle : The landscaping ( by the Olmsted brothers ) from the [ [ Alaska – Yukon – Pacific Exposition ] ] ( AYPE ) in Seattle still forms much of the [ [ University of Washington ] ] campus .
The only major building left from the AYPE , Architecture Hall , is used by the university 's architecture school .
* 1915-San Francisco :
The [ [ Palace of Fine Arts ] ]
in [ [ San Francisco ] ] and its adjacent artificial lagoon are the only major remnants of the [ [ Panama - Pacific International Exposition ] ]
still in their original locations on the former fairgrounds ( now the city 's [ [ Marina District , San FranciscoMarina District ] ] neighborhood ) , but the building is almost entirely a reconstruction .
The plaster - surfaced original , not intended to survive after the fair , was a crumbling ruin in 1964 when all but the steel framework was demolished so that it could be reproduced in concrete .
The San Francisco Civic Auditorium , now the [ [ Bill Graham Civic Auditorium ] ] , is another major legacy of the fair but was built off - site in the city 's [ [ Civic Center , San FranciscoCivic Center ] ] .
The independent [ [ Panama - California Exposition ] ]
in [ [ San Diego ] ] left a substantial legacy of permanent buildings and other structures which today define its site , San Diego 's central [ [ Balboa Park ( San Diego)Balboa Park ] ] , including the Prado walkway , the California Tower and Dome ( now home to the [ [ San Diego Museum of ManMuseum of Man ] ] ) , the 1500-foot Cabrillo Bridge , the lily pond and botanical gardens , and the [ [ Spreckels Organ Pavilion ] ] .
* 1929-Seville & Barcelona : Much survives from the two simultaneous fairs [ [ Spain ] ] hosted in that year .
Most famous are the remnants of the [ [ Ibero - American Exposition of 1929Ibero - American Exposition ] ]
in [ [ Seville ] ] , in which the Spanish Pavilion 's Plaza de España forms part of a large park and forecourt .
Most of that fair 's pavilions have survived and been adapted for other uses , with many of them becoming [ [ consulate - generalconsulates - general ] ] for the countries that built them .
The [ [ 1929 Barcelona International ExpositionBarcelona International Exposition ] ] featured the famous [ [ Barcelona PavilionGerman pavilion ] ] designed by [ [ Mies van der Rohe ] ] , which was demolished but later recreated on the original site .
* 1936-Johannesburg :
The [ [ Empire Exhibition , South Africa ] ] was built close to the [ [ University of the Witwatersrand ] ] , and by the late 1970 's the growth of the university was large enough to incorporate the permanent buildings from the exhibition .
In 1985 , the university purchased the South African Government Building ; the two Heavy Machinery Halls , now called Empire Hall and the Dining Hall ; the Hall of Transport ; the Tower of Light ; the Cape Dutch complex ; and the Bien Donne Restaurant .
* 1942-Rome : A special case is the [ [ Esposizione Universale RomaEUR ] ]
quarter in [ [ Rome ] ] , built for a World 's Fair planned for 1942 but cancelled because of [ [ World War II ] ] .
Today it hosts various offices , both governmental and private , and several museums .
* 1958-Brussels : In [ [ Brussels ] ] , the [ [ Atomium ] ] still stands at the exposition site .
It is a 165-billion - times - enlarged iron - crystal - shaped building .
Until June 2012 , the " American Theatre " on the Expo grounds was frequently used as a television studio by the [ [ Vlaamse Radio- en TelevisieomroepVRT ] ] .

* 1962-Seattle :
The [ [ Space Needle ] ] , theme building of the [ [ Century 21 Exposition ] ]
commonly known as the Seattle World 's Fair , still stands as [ [ Seattle ] ] 's iconic landmark .
The [ [ Seattle Center Monorail ] ] , the other widely known " futuristic " feature of the fair , still operates daily .

The Brussels [ [ Expo ' 58 ] ] relocated many pavilions within [ [ Belgium ] ] : the pavilion of Jacques Chocolats moved to the town of [ [ Diest ] ] to house the new town swimming pool .
Another pavilion was relocated to [ [ Willebroek ] ] and has been used as dance hall
Carré ever since .
One smaller pavilion still stands on the boulevard towards the [ [ Atomium ] ] : the restaurant " Salon 58 " in the pavilion of Comptoir Tuilier .
Many exhibitions and rides created by [ [ Walt Disney ] ] and his [ [ Walt Disney ImagineeringWED Enterprises ] ] company for the [ [ 1964 New York World 's Fair ] ]
( which was held over into 1965 ) were moved to [ [ Disneyland Park ( Anaheim)Disneyland ] ]
after the closing of the Fair .
Many of the rides , including " [ [ it 's a small world ] ] " , and " [ [ Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln ] ] " , as well as the building that housed the Carousel of Progress are still in operation .
Disney had contributed so many exhibits to the New York fair in part because the corporation had originally envisioned a " permanent World 's Fair " at the Flushing site .
That concept instead came to fruition with the Disney theme park [ [ Epcot ] ] , an extension of the [ [ Walt Disney World Resort ] ] , near [ [ Orlando , Florida ] ] .
Epcot has many of the characteristics of a typical universal exposition : national pavilions , as well as exhibits concerning technology and/or the future , along with more typical amusement park rides .
Meanwhile , several of the 1964 attractions , relocated to [ [ Disneyland Park ( Anaheim)Disneyland ] ] , have been duplicated at the [ [ Walt Disney World Resort ] ] .
Occasionally other bits and pieces of the fairs remain .
In the [ [ New York City ] ]
[ [ New York City Subwaysubway ] ]
system , signs directing people to [ [ Flushing , QueensFlushing ] ]
Meadows , [ [ Queens ] ] remain from the 1964–65 event .
In the [ [ Montreal ] ] subway at least one tile artwork of its theme , " Man and His World " , remains .
Also , a seemingly endless supply of souvenir items from fair visits can be found , and in the United States , at least , can often be bought at garage or estate sales .
Many of these events also produced [ [ postage stamp]]s and commemorative [ [ coin]]s .
The [ [ 1904 Olympic Games ] ] , officially known as the Games of the III Olympiad , were held in conjunction with the 1904 [ [ St . Louis , MissouriSt .
Louis ] ]
fair , although no particular tie - in seems to have been made .
The [ [ Exposition Universelle ( 1900 ) ] ]
[ [ Paris ] ] was also loosely tied to the Olympic Games .
