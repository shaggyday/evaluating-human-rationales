As an adult , Gamora was sent as an assassin against the Universal Church of Truth , quickly becoming feared by its agents , the Black Knights .
She exacted revenge for the genocide of her race by killing every member of the church involved before the event actually occurred .
Gamora met and teamed up with Adam Warlock , who wanted to stop his future , evil self .
She even managed to get close to the Magus but failed her assassination in the last second .

When Thanos managed to obtain all the Infinity Gems , forming the Infinity Gauntlet , Adam Warlock decided that he must be stopped .
Warlock led Gamora and Pip the Troll out of Soulworld into the real world .
Their souls took over the bodies of three humans , who had recently died in a car crash .

While on Earth , most of the holders of the stones agrees that the Infinity Stones should be taken off - planet , Turk Barrett , who holds the Mind Stone and used it to set himself up with a nice little criminal enterprise in Manhattan , however is not willing to hand it over .
