VODKA SAUCE Vodka sauce is an American cuisine sauce made from a smooth tomato sauce , vodka , typical Italian herbs and heavy cream , which gives the sauce its distinctive orange coloration .
It gained popularity in the 1970s , when a variation won a national recipe contest in Italy , although it may well have been a sauce before its popularization in the 1970s .
It is a key ingredient in penne alla vodka .
The vodka 's function is , ostensibly , to release flavors in the tomato that are normally inaccessible ; using alcoholic beverages for this purpose is common in Italian cooking , although usually accomplished with wine .
It is also an emulsifier , serving to keep the sauce stable , when normally the oil of the cream sauce would react with the acidic tomato sauce to separate from the water in both .
