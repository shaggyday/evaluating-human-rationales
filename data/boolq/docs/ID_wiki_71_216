The series was filmed in Penang , Malaysia , as a stand - in for Simla .
Simla was not chosen due to the large number of modern buildings and a monsoon season that would have interfered with filming .
Shooting locations included Penang Hill and historic buildings in and around George Town , which share a similar British colonial architectural lineage .
