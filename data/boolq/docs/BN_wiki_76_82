PLOT Section::::Plot .
Ren McCormack , a teenager raised in Chicago , moves with his mother to the small town of Bomont to live with his aunt and uncle .
Soon after arriving , Ren befriends Willard Hewitt , and from him learns the city council has banned dancing and rock music .
He soon begins to fall for a rebellious teenage girl named Ariel , who has an abusive boyfriend , Chuck Cranston , and a strict father , Shaw Moore , who is a reverend of the local church .
After trading insults with Chuck , Ren is challenged to a game of chicken involving tractors .
Ren wins when his shoelace becomes stuck and prevents him from jumping from the tractor .
Reverend Moore distrusts Ren , and he grounds Ariel , forbidding her to see him .
Ren and his classmates want to do away with the no - dancing law and have a senior prom .
He drives Ariel , Willard , and Ariel 's best friend , Rusty , to a country bar about 100 miles away from Bomont to experience the joy and freedom of dancing , but once there , Willard is unable to dance and gets into a jealous fight with a man who dances with Rusty .
Later , Ren teaches Willard to dance .
Ren decides to challenge the anti - dancing ordinance so that the senior class can hold a senior prom .
He goes before the city council and reads several Bible verses to cite scriptural support for the worth of dancing to rejoice , exercise , or celebrate .
Although Reverend Moore is moved , the council votes against Ren 's proposal .
Vi , Moore 's wife , is supportive of the movement and explains to Moore that he can not be everyone 's father and that he is hardly being a father to Ariel .
She also says that dancing and music are not the problem .
Moore feels betrayed that even his wife does not believe in him even though she assures him that she always did , telling him , " Shaw , it 's
20 years now I 've been a minister 's wife .
And I 've been quiet , supportive , unobtrusive ; and after 20 years I still think you 're a wonderful , wonderful preacher .
You can lift a congregation up so high they have to look down to see Heaven .
But it 's the one - to - one where you need a little work . "
Despite further discussion with Ren about his own family losses in comparison to Moore 's losses and Ariel 's opening up about her own sinful past , even going so far as to admit that she has had sexual relations , Moore can not bring himself to change his stance .
His son Bobby was killed in a car crash while returning from a night of dancing , resulting in Moore 's arranging to ban music and dancing in the community .
However , he has a change of heart after seeing some of the townsfolk burning books that they think are dangerous to the youth .
Realizing the situation has gotten out of hand , Moore stops the book - burning , rebukes the people , and sends them home .
The following Sunday , Moore asks his congregation to pray for the high school students putting on the prom , which is set up at a grain mill just outside the Bomont town limits .
Shaw and Vi listen outside , dancing for the first time in years .
Chuck and his friends arrive and start a fight with Willard , who with Ren knocks them out .
Ren , Ariel , Willard , and Rusty rejoin the party and happily dance the night away .

RECEPTION CRITICAL RESPONSE Section::::Reception .
Section::::Critical response .
The film received mixed reviews from critics .
Chicago Sun - Times critic Roger Ebert called it " a seriously confused movie that tries to do three things , and does all of them badly .
It wants to tell the story of a conflict in a town , it wants to introduce some flashy teenage characters , and part of the time it wants to be a music video . "
Dave Denby in New York rechristened the film " Schlockdance " , writing : " Footloose may be a hit , but it 's trash - high powered fodder for the teen market ...
The only person to come out of the film better off is the smooth - cheeked , pug - nosed Bacon , who gives a cocky but likeable Mr. Cool performance . "
Jane Lamacraft reassessed the film for Sight and Sound " Forgotten pleasures of the multiplex " feature in 2010 , writing " Nearly three decades on , Bacon 's vest - clad set - piece dance in a flour mill looks cheesily 1980s , but the rest of Ross 's drama wears its age well , real song - and - dance joy for the pre - Glee generation .
