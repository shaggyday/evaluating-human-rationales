HUNTING IN AUSTRALIA
The University of Queensland estimates that Australia has around 300,000 active hunters investing a conservative $ 556,650,000 annually into the Australian economy .
Australia has a population of about twenty - three million , of which one million are involved in shooting and firearms .
there is around 5.8 million legally owned firearms in Australia ranging from bolt action , pump action , lever action and semi - automatic firearms .
A survey of recreational hunters identified the following usage rates of particular hunting methods : Rifle 92.3 % , Bow 16.4 % , Black Powder 3.4 % , Shotgun 56.0 % , Dogs only 8.6 % , Other 3.3 % ANIMALS Section::::Animals .
Many species of animals in Australia have been introduced by European settlers since the 18th century .
Among these are rabbits , hares , cats , foxes , goats , pigs , dogs , deer , donkeys , horses and feral cattle ( including banteng ) , camels and water buffalo .
The most commonly hunted animals by recreational hunters are rabbits , foxes , ducks , pigs , feral cats and feral goats .
Hunting of rabbits is encouraged across all of Australia as they are considered a highly invasive pest .
The most common form of hunting is ground shooting .
The recreational hunting of foxes is also commonly done by shooting .
However , this usually requires other techniques to lure and shoot the animal such as the use use of the fox whistle , which makes a sound like a distressed rabbit , or spotlighting .
The commercial hunting of kangaroos was recorded as 1,560,586 in 2012 .
Six species of deer can be found in Australia .
*
The chital ( Axis axis ) is also known as the Indian spotted deer , they are light to dark brown with permanent white spots which appear as broken lines running along the body .
Typically has three tined antlers .
*
The hog deer ( Axis porcinus ) is a close relative of the chital , they range from a uniform dark brown during winter to a rich reddish - brown in summer at which time light coloured spots along the sides and on either side of the dark dorsal stripe are visible in individuals .
Typically has three tined antlers but extra points are not unheard of .
*
The sambar ( Cervus unicolor ) is the largest deer species to be found in Australia .
They are normally brown but individuals of grey to almost black are seen .
Typically has three tined antlers but with a wide variety of styles .
*
The rusa ( Cervus timorensis ) is a close relative of the sambar but smaller in size , they are a uniform grey - brown , variable between individuals and season .
Typically has three tined antlers .
*
The fallow deer ( Dama dama ) is the most common species of deer in the world .
In the summer they are light to reddish brown with white spots .
In the winter this changes to a greyish brown .
*
The red deer ( Cervus elaphus ) ranges from a dull brown in winter coat to a rich reddish brown in summer ; a permanent straw - coloured rump or caudal patch is retained throughout the year LEGISLATION Section::::Legislation .

ABORIGINAL HUNTING
Section::::Aboriginal hunting .
Aboriginal Australians lived on the Australian continent for thousands of years before Europeans settlement in the late 1700s .
They had a wealth of animals to hunt and had very refined and sometimes ingenious ways of hunting them .
HUNTING TECHNIQUES
Boomerang
Section::::Hunting techniques .
Boomerangs have been used as a hunting tool by Aborigines for tens of thousands of years .
The way a hunter tends to use a boomerang is to rustle tree branches , causing the birds inside to be startled and fly into nets that the hunter had already set up between trees .
Contrary to popular belief , Aboriginal hunting boomerangs are not designed to return to the thrower .
Throwing sticks Related to the boomerang , a throwing stick is bigger and heavier .
These heaftier weapons are used to hunt bigger animals such as kangaroos .
They were thrown straight at their target and could even break bones on impact .
This made it a lethal tool in the hands of an experienced hunter .
Fire Aboriginals use fire to clear vegetation from patches of land to make it easier to hunt game .
Among the animals hunted are monitor lizards .
Surprisingly in areas where the technique is used , the lizard population increases by as much as 100 % .
This is thought to be because burning established vegetation clears land for the growth of new plant species , increasing biodiversity thus improving the lizards ' habitat .
The widespread persecution of Aboriginals in the mid-20th century which led to a decrease in Aboriginal hunting and burning may be partly responsible for the extinction of many desert species that had adapted to an environment that Aboriginals played a key role in shaping .
Since their arrival on the Australian continent thousands of years ago , Aboriginal Australians had become an essential part of the ecosystem .
LEGAL FRAMEWORK Section::::Legal framework .
The National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975
( Cth ) mandates Aboriginal people are not subject to general conservation restrictions so long as they engage in hunting only for food , ceremonial or religious purposes ( in all cases must be non - commercial ) .
However , restrictions may be put in place in order to protect wildlife and must specifically state that such restrictions apply to Aboriginal people .
This section does not give an Aboriginal person right of entry onto land .
Entry onto private land , state forests , national parks or other kinds of crown land is regulated under State or Territory Legislation and is variable .
CONTROVERSY Section::::Controversy .
There has been a number of controversies surrounding indigenous Australians and the Australian government regarding their hunting rights .
In 1993 , the Australian Government brought in legislation called the Native Title Act .
This act meant that the Australian Government recognised that the Aboriginal Australians have rights to and interests to their land that come from their traditional laws and customs .
One of the activities that are covered by the Native Title is the right for the Aborigines to hunt otherwise endangered species for food or ceremonial purposes .
The killing of endangered is a wide source of outrage with many calling for a rewrite of the legislation to protect the endangered species .
