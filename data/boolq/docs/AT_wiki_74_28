PLOT Section::::Plot .
Shortly after his 50th birthday , LAPD Homicide Sergeant Roger Murtaugh is partnered with Sergeant Martin Riggs , a transfer from narcotics .
Riggs , a former Special Forces soldier who lost his wife in a car accident three years prior , has turned suicidal , and has been taking his aggression out on suspects , leading to his superiors requesting his transfer .
Murtaugh and Riggs quickly find themselves facing off with each other .
Murtaugh is contacted by Michael Hunsaker , a Vietnam War buddy and banker , but before they can meet , Murtaugh learns that Hunsaker 's daughter , Amanda , apparently committed suicide by jumping from her apartment balcony .
Autopsy reports show Amanda to have been poisoned with drain cleaner , making the case a possible homicide .
Hunsaker tells Murtaugh that he was concerned about his daughter 's involvement in drugs , prostitution , and pornography , and was trying to get Murtaugh to help her escape that life .
Murtaugh and Riggs attempt to question Amanda 's pimp , but find a drug lab on the premises , leading to a shootout .
Riggs kills the pimp and saves the life of Murtaugh , who starts to tolerate his new partner .
Even though the case seems closed , Riggs is aware that the only witness to Amanda 's apparent suicide was Dixie , another prostitute who was working away from her normal streets .
They attempt to question Dixie at her home , but it explodes as they approach it .
Riggs finds parts of a mercury switch from bomb debris , indicating a professional had set the bomb ; some children who had been nearby witnessed a man approach the house with a tattoo similar to the one Riggs has , and Murtaugh suspects Hunsaker is not telling the full picture .
The pair approach Hunsaker before Amanda 's funeral , where he reveals that he had previously been part of " Shadow Company , " a heroin - smuggling operation run by former special forces operators from the Vietnam War , masterminded by retired General Peter McAllister and his right - hand chief enforcer , Mr. Joshua .
Hunsaker had been laundering the money , but wanted to get out , and when McAllister found out he had contacted Murtaugh , the general had Amanda killed in retaliation .
As Murtaugh tries to get Hunsaker to reveal everything he knows about Shadow Company , Joshua arrives in a helicopter and kills Hunsaker .
Then Shadow Company attempts to kill Riggs in a drive - by shooting , but he is saved by a bulletproof vest .
Murtaugh and Riggs fake his murder to gain the upper hand .
Shadow Company later kidnaps Murtaugh 's daughter Rianne and demand that Murtaugh turn himself over to them for her return .
Murtaugh and Riggs plan an ambush at the exchange at El Mirage Lake with Riggs providing sniper support , but Riggs is caught by McAllister and the trio are taken to an unknown location .
Murtaugh and Riggs are tortured for information , but Riggs manages to overpower the captors , frees Murtaugh and Rianne , and they escape to find themselves at a busy nightclub used as a front for Shadow Company .
With their cover blown , McAllister and Joshua attempt to escape separately .
Joshua manages to get away , but McAllister 's driver is shot by Murtaugh , causing the general 's car to veer out of control and get struck by a bus on Hollywood Boulevard , and McAllister is killed when a fire causes hand grenades in the car to detonate .
Murtaugh and Riggs race to Murtaugh 's home , knowing that Joshua will come after his family for revenge .
They arrive in time to prevent him , and Riggs beats Joshua in a violent brawl on the front lawn .
As backup officers arrive to take Joshua into custody , he breaks free and steals a gun from one of the patrolmen , but Murtaugh and Riggs pull their guns and shoot Joshua dead .
After visiting his wife 's grave , Riggs spends Christmas with the Murtaughs , having become best friends with Murtaugh and bonding with the rest of the family .
Riggs also gives Murtaugh a symbolic gift : a hollow - point bullet which he had been saving to commit suicide , as he does not need it anymore .

Recent UCLA graduate Shane Black wrote the screenplay in mid-1985 .
Black stated that his intention was to do an " urban western " inspired by Dirty Harry where a violent character " reviled for what he did , what he is capable of , the things he believed in " is eventually recruited for being the one that could solve the problem .
The protagonists would be everymen policemen , " guys shuffling in a town like Los Angeles searching for something noble as justice when they 're just guys in washed and worn suits seeking a paycheck " .
According to Black , his original first draft of the script was very different and much darker than the final film .
It was 140 pages long and both the plot and characters were different , and action scenes were also much bigger .
The ending of the script contained a chase scene with helicopters and a trailer truck full of cocaine exploding over Hollywood Hills with cocaine snowing over the Hollywood sign .
Black hated this first draft and initially discarded it but later picked it up again and re - wrote it into the new drafts that were eventually used for filming .
His agent sent the Lethal Weapon script to various studios , being rejected before Warner Bros. executive Mark Canton took a liking to it .
Canton brought along producer Joel Silver , who loved the story and worked with Black to further develop the script .
Director Richard Donner also brought in writer Jeffrey Boam to do some uncredited re - writes on Black 's script after he found parts of it to be too dark .
Boam mostly added some more humor into the script , and later did a complete re - write of Shane Black and Warren Murphy 's rejected script for the second film .
He also wrote the script for the third film and an unused draft for the fourth film .
After the script was purchased for $ 250,000 , studio production executives offered it to director Richard Donner , who also loved it .
Leonard Nimoy was one of the choices considered for directing , but he did not feel comfortable doing action films , and he was working on Three Men and a Baby at the time .
With those key elements in place , the search began for the right combination of actors to play Riggs and Murtaugh .
Mel Gibson was invited by Richard Donner as he was interested in working with the actor after Ladyhawke .
Casting director Marion Dougherty first suggested teaming Gibson with Danny Glover , given Murtaugh had no set ethnicity in the script .
She arranged for Gibson to fly in from his home in Sydney while Glover was flown in from Chicago , where he was appearing in a play , to read through the script .
According to a June 2007 Vanity Fair magazine article , Bruce Willis was considered for the Riggs role .
This is referenced in the spoof of the Lethal Weapon films , Loaded Weapon 1 .
Bruce ( as John McClane ) appears after the villains attack the wrong beach residence , looking for the protagonist .
According to Donner , " It took about two hours and by the time we were done , I was in seventh heaven .
They found innuendoes ; they found laughter where I never saw it ; they found tears where they did n't exist before ; and , most importantly , they found a relationship — all in just one reading .
So if you ask about casting ...
it was magical , just total dynamite . "
Explains Gibson , " This particular story was a cut above others I had passed on , because the action is really a sideline which heightens the story of these two great characters .
I picture Riggs as an almost Chaplinesque figure , a guy who does n't expect anything from life and even toys with the idea of taking his own .
He 's not like these stalwarts who come down from Mt. Olympus and wreak havoc and go away .
He 's somebody who does n't look like he 's set to go off until he actually does . "
The draw for Glover was equally strong .
Fresh from his success as Mister in The Color Purple , he felt the role of Roger Murtaugh offered a whole new range of character expression and experience .
"
Aside from the chance to work with Mel , which turned out to be pure pleasure , one of the reasons I jumped at this project was the family aspect .
The chance to play intricate relationships and subtle humor that exist in every close family group was an intriguing challenge , as was playing a guy turning 50 .
Murtaugh 's a little cranky about his age until everything he loves is threatened .
His reawakening parallels Riggs ' . " Both actors were signed by early spring 1986 .
Gibson and Glover then flew home to pack , and , returning to Los Angeles , began an intensive two months of physical training and preparation .
Meanwhile , the crucial role of Joshua was settled when Gary Busey asked for a chance to read for the part .
An established star since his Academy Award - nominated performance in The Buddy Holly Story , Busey had not auditioned for a film in years .
" I had butterflies , " he said .
" I 'd never played a bad guy .
And no one had seen me since I 'd lost 60 pounds and got back into shape .
But I decided to take the initiative in order to have the opportunity to work with Dick , Joel , Mel and Danny .
I 'm constantly looking for someone to pull the best performance out of me and any of those guys could .
They even talked me into dyeing my hair ! "
In his E !
True Hollywood Story biography , Busey says he was hired to play Joshua because they were looking for someone big and menacing enough to be a believable foe for Mel Gibson .
Busey also credits the film for reviving his failing film career .
Stunt coordinator Bobby Bass planned and supervised all phases of Gibson 's and Glover 's intense pre - production training ; physical conditioning , weight workouts , and weapons handling and safety .
Bass also used his own military experiences to bring a greater depth of understanding to the Riggs character .
To familiarize the actors with the specialized skills and sensibilities acquired by undercover cops , arrangements were made for Gibson and Glover to spend time in the field accompanying working L.A.P.D. officers .
Throughout filming , technical advisers from the L.A.P.D. as well as the L.A. County Sheriff 's Department worked closely with Donner and the actors to ensure authenticity .
MARTIAL ARTS Section::::Martial arts .
Cedric Adams was the first technical adviser brought in . "
Adams thought the best possible way to show just how lethal Riggs really is — is to show his mastery of a form of martial arts never before seen onscreen , " said Donner .
Donner wanted Riggs ' style of fighting to be unique with the second assistant director Willie Simmons , who was interested in unusual forms of martial arts , choosing three martial arts styles .
Gibson and Busey were instructed in Capoeira by Adams , Jailhouse rock by Dennis Newsome and Brazilian Jiu - Jitsu by Rorion Gracie .
Bobby Bass , the stunt coordinator , a former US Army Special Forces instructor and judo champion , also provided training in various techniques .
At one point , the actors trained in between filming , for four hours a day for six weeks and did months of choreography .
MUSIC Section::::Music .
Michael Kamen , who just completed work on Highlander , composed the score for Lethal Weapon .
The guitar part of Riggs ' theme was performed by Eric Clapton .
Kamen and Clapton had worked together on the music for the 1985 BBC TV series Edge of Darkness ( the feature adaptation of which would later , by coincidence , star Mel Gibson ) .
The saxophone part of Murtaugh 's theme was performed by David Sanborn .
The Christmas song " Jingle Bell Rock " , performed by Bobby Helms , is played during the film 's opening credits .
Honeymoon Suite 's song , " Lethal Weapon , " is played during the film 's end credits without being credited .

ALTERNATE VERSIONS Section::::Alternate versions .
An alternate opening and ending were both filmed and can be seen on the Lethal Weapon 4 DVD .
The alternate opening featured Martin Riggs drinking alone in a bar where he is accosted by a couple of thugs who attack him for his money , but are easily subdued by Riggs .
Director Richard Donner felt the film should open with a brighter look at Riggs , and replaced the bar scene with the scene in which Riggs awakens in his trailer .
The alternate ending featured Riggs telling Murtaugh not to retire .
Without even thinking about the possibility of sequels , Donner decided that Riggs and Murtaugh 's relationship is one of friendship , and filmed the ending that appears in the completed film .

The Director 's Cut version is longer ( 117 minutes ) than the original theatrical release version ( 110 minutes ) , and features additional scenes .
