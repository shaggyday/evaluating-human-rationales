BASEBALL
AT
THE SUMMER OLYMPICS Baseball at the Summer Olympics unofficially debuted at the 1904 Summer Olympics , and became an official Olympic sport at the 1992 Summer Olympics .
The event was last played in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing with South Korea taking the gold ; the sport was dropped from the Summer Olympic programme , but will be revived as part of the programme for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo .
Olympic baseball is governed by the World Baseball Softball Confederation ( WBSC ) .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Although little was recorded , Olympic baseball first appeared at the 1904 St. Louis games .
Eight years later in 1912 in Stockholm , a United States team played against host Sweden , winning 13–3 .
Baseball was also played at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris , the American team beating the French team ( the local Ranelagh Club ) 5–0 in a four inning exhibition game .
In 1936 in Berlin , two United States teams played each other before approximately 90,000–100,000 spectators at the Reichsportsfeld .
The 1952 Helsinki event was a modified form of the sport , Finnish baseball , played by two Finnish teams .
Australia played a one - game exhibition against the United States in 1956 Melbourne and Japan did the same in 1964 in Tokyo .
With a crowd of nearly 114,000 spectators , this game at the Melbourne Cricket Ground held the record for the highest attended exhibition baseball game ever until a 2008 American game in Los Angeles .
After a twenty - year hiatus , Olympic baseball ( labelled an exhibition sport / event by the IOC ) returned but with tournament formatting ( 1984 Los Angeles ) .
At the 1988 Seoul games , it was termed a demonstration sport .
Japan defeated the United States in the inaugural tournament finale in 1984 .
However , in 1988 , the United States won over Japan .
Baseball became an official sport at the 1992 Summer Olympics , with the familiar eight team tournament .
Players were required to be amateurs .
The tournament consisted of a round - robin , in which teams played each of the other teams , followed by semifinals and finals .
The format of the competition remained the same after that , with the only major change being that starting in 2000 players were not required to be amateurs .
At the IOC meeting on July 7 , 2005 , baseball and softball were voted out of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London , United Kingdom , becoming the first sports voted out of the Olympics since polo was eliminated from the 1936 Olympics .
The elimination excised 16 teams and more than 300 athletes from the 2012 Olympics .
The two slots left available by the IOC 's elimination were subsequently filled by golf and rugby sevens in 2016 .
This decision was reaffirmed on February 9 , 2006 .
In the stands during the 2008 bronze medal game between the U.S. and Japan , IOC head Jacques Rogge was interviewed by MLB.com 's Mark Newman and cited various criteria for baseball to earn its way back in :
" To be on the Olympic program is an issue where you need universality as much as possible .
You need to have a sport with a following , you need to have the best players and you need to be in strict compliance with WADA ( World Anti - Doping Agency ) .
And these are the qualifications that have to be met .
When you have all that , you have to win hearts .
You can win the mind , but you still must win hearts . "
It was officially decided in August 2009 at the IOC Board meeting in Berlin that baseball would also not be included in the 2016 Summer Olympics .
On April 1 , 2011 , the IBAF and the International Softball Federation announced they were preparing a joint proposal to revive play of both sports at the 2020 Summer Olympics .
In August 2011 , Olympic news source Around the Rings reported that the ISF and IBAF would not rush into an Olympic proposal , and that the IBAF was working on forming a temporary commission to analyze the prospect of a joint proposal .
" In the past , baseball and softball were running alone , and the result was that baseball and softball stayed out , " IBAF president Riccardo Fraccari said in reference to their decades - long push for Olympic inclusion .
On September 8 , 2013 , the International Olympic Committee voted to reinstate wrestling , defeating the combined baseball - softball bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics .
Under new IOC policies that shift the Games to an " event - based " programme rather than sport - based , the host organizing committee can now also propose the addition of sports to the programme alongside the permanent " core " events .
A second bid for baseball - softball to be included as an event in 2020 was shortlisted by the Tokyo Organizing Committee on 22 June 2015 .
On 3 August 2016 during the 129th IOC Session in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , the IOC approved the Tokyo Organizing Committee 's final shortlist of five sports , which included baseball , to be included in the programme during the 2020 Summer Olympics .

QUALIFICATION Section::::Qualification .
The host nation was always guaranteed a place in the Olympic baseball tournament .
The other seven places were generally determined by continental qualifying tournaments .
For the 2008 Games , the Americas received two places , Europe received one place , and Asia received one place .
The final three places were given to the top three nations at an eight - team tournament held after the continental tournaments .
Qualification for this tournament was determined by those continental tournaments .
The third and fourth place American teams , second and third place European teams , second and third place Asian teams , first place African team , and first place
Oceania team competed in that tournament .
This qualification tournament was new for 2008 .
It was created after heavy criticism of the previous qualification standard .
In previous Olympics , only two teams from the Americas were able to qualify for the Olympics , despite the fact that the vast majority of the top baseball - playing nations in the world came from this region .
Europe , whose baseball nations were substantially weaker , also entered two teams .
COMPETITION Section::::Competition .
Olympic baseball was nearly identical to most professional baseball .
Aluminum bats were disallowed after 1996 Atlanta .
There was also a mercy rule that was invoked if a team was winning by 10 or more runs after 7 innings ( or 6.5 innings if the home team was leading ) .
For Sydney 2000 , rosters were expanded to 24 players .
The tournament consisted of a round - robin preliminary round in which each team played all 7 of the other teams .
Only the top four teams advanced to the medals round .
In that round , semifinals were played between the 1st/4th place teams and the 2nd/3rd place teams .
The semifinal losers then played a bronze medal game , with the winner earning the medal and the loser receiving 4th place .
The semifinal winners played in the final , which awarded the winner a gold medal and the loser a silver medal .
During the 2008 games a unique rule went into effect during games which went into extra innings .
If the game was still tied after the completion of the tenth inning base runners were automatically placed on first and second base with no outs .
IBAF created this rule to encourage scoring late in the game in order to determine a winner and to address criticisms from the IOC that a baseball game 's length was unpredictable .
