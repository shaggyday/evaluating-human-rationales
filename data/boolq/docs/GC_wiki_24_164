PLOT Section::::Plot .
During World War II , after the Soviet invasion of Poland , young Polish army officer Janusz Wieszczek ( Jim Sturgess ) is held as a POW and interrogated by the NKVD .
The Soviets , unable to get him to admit that he is a spy , take his wife into custody ; from her they extort a statement condemning him .
He is sentenced to 20 years in a Gulag labour camp deep in Siberia .
There he meets those with whom he later plans an escape : Mr. Smith ( Ed Harris ) , an American engineer ; Khabarov ( Mark Strong ) , an actor ; Valka ( Colin Farrell ) , a hardened Russian criminal ; Tomasz ( Alexandru Potocean ) , a Polish artist ; Voss ( Gustaf Skarsgård ) , a Latvian priest ; Kazik ( Sebastian Urzendowsky ) , a Pole suffering from night blindness ; and Zoran ( Dragoș Bucur ) , a Yugoslav accountant .
Khabarov secretly tells Janusz that he is planning to escape south to Mongolia , passing Lake Baikal .
Smith cautions Janusz that it is Khabarov 's way to discuss escape plans with newcomers , to maintain his morale , but nothing will come of it .
At times Janusz seems to hallucinate the front door of a country home and adjoining window ledge , which holds plants and a rock he attempts to reach for .
Janusz follows through with the escape with Smith , Valka , Voss , Tomasz , Zoran and Kazik during a severe snowstorm that covers their tracks .
Kazik freezes to death the second night of the trek , after losing his way back to the campsite while looking for wood , and the group buries him .
After many days of travelling across the snows of Siberia , the group reaches Lake Baikal .
There they meet Irena ( Saoirse Ronan ) , a young Polish girl , who tells them that Russian soldiers murdered her parents and sent her to a collective farm near Warsaw , where they treated her cruelly , so she escaped .
Smith realises the inaccuracies in her story , as Warsaw is occupied by the Germans ; nevertheless , despite his misgivings that she 'll slow them down and tax their meager food supply , he agrees with the group to let her in .
Smith eventually cautions her about the lie and says he will not tolerate any more , in response to which she admits that her parents were communists but the communist rulers killed them anyway and sent her to an orphanage .
When the group reaches an unpatrolled border between the Soviet Union and Mongolia , Valka , who idolizes Joseph Stalin and does not know what he would do elsewhere , decides to stay .
The rest continue to Ulan Bator , but soon they see images of Stalin and a red star .
Janusz realises that Mongolia is under communist control and since China is at war with Japan , tells the group they should take refuge in British India .
As they continue south across the Gobi Desert , lack of water , sandstorms , sunburn , blisters and sunstroke weaken the group .
Irena collapses several times and soon dies .
A few days later Tomasz collapses and dies .
Smith is on the verge of death , but after being motivated by Janusz , Zoran and Voss , decides to rejoin the group and the severely dehydrated four find a much - needed water source .
Soon after they reach China passing through the Great Wall .
As they reach the Himalayas , all of them on the verge of death , they are rescued by a Tibetan monk who takes them to a Buddhist monastery where they regain their strength .
Smith decides to go to Lhasa with the help of one of the monk 's contacts , who will smuggle him out through China .
Once there , he anticipates he will be able to connect with the US military , his return to America ensured .
The remaining three continue to trek through the Himalayas and soon reach India .
At the end of the film , Janusz keeps walking around the world until 1989 , when the communist regime in Poland is ousted from power .
The final scene of the film shows Janusz , 50 years after being taken captive , again envisioning the door and reaching for the rock ; this time he takes a key hidden beneath the rock to open the door and reconcile with his wife .

PRODUCTION
BACKGROUND

Section::::Background .
The film is loosely based on The Long Walk ( 1956 ) , Sławomir Rawicz 's memoir depicting his alleged escape from a Siberian Gulag and subsequent 4,000-mile walk to freedom in Nepal ( but called India in the movie ) .
The book sold over 500,000 copies and is credited with inspiring many explorers .
In 2006 the BBC unearthed records ( including some written by Rawicz himself ) which showed that , rather than having escaped from the gulag , he had in fact been released by the USSR in 1942 .
In May 2009 Witold Gliński , a Polish World War II veteran living in the United Kingdom , came forward to claim that the basis of Rawicz 's story was true , but it was actually an account of what had happened to him , not Rawicz .
Glinski 's claims have also been seriously questioned .
In addition , in 1942 , a group of Siberian Gulag escapees is said to have hiked into Nepal .
However , this too is suspect .
Nevertheless , there is some circumstantial evidence that some sort of trek to freedom occurred , via the route outlined in the book and film .
Captain Rupert Mayne , a British intelligence officer in Calcutta in 1942 , interviewed three emaciated men , who claimed to have escaped from Siberia .
Mayne always believed their story was the same as that of The Long Walk .
So the possibility remains
that someone - even if not Rawicz - achieved this extraordinary feat .
Though the director Peter Weir continues to claim that the so - called long walk happened , he himself now describes The Way Back as " essentially a fictional film " .
Many of the events that happen in the gulag scenes come from Varlam Shalamov 's The Kolyma Tales , such as the scene where the man is killed for his sweater .
Laurence Harvey and Herbert Wilcox announced plans to make a film from The Long Walk in 1957 .
The actor Jeremy Child had the rights to the book for many years .
He is thanked by the producers in the films credits .
