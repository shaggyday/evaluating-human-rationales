PLOT Section::::Plot .
Ariel and Eric celebrate the birth of their newborn daughter Melody on a ship at sea .
Ariel 's father King Triton presents Melody with a magic locket .
The party is interrupted by Ursula 's sister Morgana , who threatens to have Melody fed to her pet tiger shark , Undertow , unless Triton surrenders his trident to her .
Morgana then announces her plan to use the trident to avenge Ursula and take over the ocean .
Ariel and Eric work together to foil Morgana 's plan , and Triton shrinks Undertow to the size of a piranha .
Morgana escapes , eluding the attempts of King Triton 's forces to capture her and declaring that she will someday exact her revenge on both Ariel and Triton and avenge Ursula 's death .
Fearing Morgana and remembering Ursula , Ariel decides that , until Morgana is captured , they will have to withhold all knowledge of the sea world and her heritage from Melody in order to protect her .
Triton tosses the locket into the ocean , and a massive wall is built to separate the royal castle from the sea .
Triton assigns Sebastian to watch over Melody like he did with Ariel in the first film .
12 years later , Melody remains unaware of her mother 's mermaid heritage and is forbidden from ever going into the sea .
However , she has been sneaking out of the castle regularly to swim , and one day finds the locket .
Seeing her name on the locket , Melody questions her mother about it , but Ariel furiously confronts Melody and forbids her to go into the sea .
Frustrated with her mother 's refusal to answer her questions , Melody steals a small boat and sails away from home .
Melody is discovered by Undertow , who leads her straight to Morgana .
In a panic , Sebastian confesses to Ariel and Eric that Melody went out to the sea .
Meanwhile , Melody meets Morgana , who reveals that Melody 's background is marine , and uses the remains of Ursula 's magic to transform Melody into a mermaid .
Triton prepares search parties , and is convinced by Ariel and Eric to use his trident to transform Ariel back into a mermaid in order to help in the search for Melody .
Ariel searches the sea for Melody , regretting not sharing her heritage with her , while Melody explores her newfound abilities as a mermaid , and has a strong feeling that she was meant to be part of the sea .
Melody visits Morgana to thank her , only for Morgana to tell Melody that the spell was only temporary , and that she can only make the spell permanent if Melody retrieves the trident from Triton , which Morgana claims he stole from her .
Melody decides to get the trident , and during her search befriends Tip and Dash , a penguin and walrus duo who join her .
Melody succeeds in stealing the trident , and returns to Morgana , but before Melody can hand the trident over to Morgana , Ariel arrives and pleads for Melody not to give Morgana the trident .
Melody refuses to listen to Ariel , having been angered by Ariel 's decision to lie to her , and gives Morgana the trident .
With the trident in her power , Morgana reveals her true intentions , then reveals to Melody that she stole from her grandfather and throws her against the wall , trapping her in a cave by sealing the entrance with a thick layer of ice and informing her that her time as a mermaid is about to expire .
Soon afterward , Morgana 's spell on Melody wears off , causing her to revert into a human and nearly drown .
Tip and Dash manage to free her and drag her to the shore .
Morgana uses the trident 's magic to lord over the ocean , rising to the surface to gloat .
Scuttle , Triton , Sebastian , and Eric arrive , and a battle ensues against Morgana and her minions .
Melody manages to grab the trident and throws it back to Triton , who encases Morgana in a block of ice , which sinks underwater .
Melody reunites with her family , and Triton offers his granddaughter the choice of becoming a mermaid permanently .
Instead , Melody uses the trident to disintegrate the wall separating her home from the sea , reuniting the humans and the merpeople .
