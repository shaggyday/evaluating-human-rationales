CARBON – HYDROGEN BOND
The carbon - hydrogen bond ( C – H bond ) is a bond between carbon and hydrogen atoms that can be found in many organic compounds .
This bond is a covalent bond meaning that carbon shares its outer valence electrons with up to four hydrogens .
This completes both of their outer shells making them stable .
Carbon – hydrogen bonds have a bond length of about 1.09 Å ( 1.09 × 10 m ) and a bond energy of about 413 kJ / mol ( see table below ) .
Using Pauling 's scale — C ( 2.55 ) and H ( 2.2)—the electronegativity difference between these two atoms is 0.35 .
Because of this small difference in electronegativities , the C−H bond is generally regarded as being non - polar .
In structural formulas of molecules , the hydrogen atoms are often omitted .
Compound classes consisting solely of C – H bonds and C – C bonds are alkanes , alkenes , alkynes , and aromatic hydrocarbons .
Collectively they are known as hydrocarbons .
In October 2016 , astronomers reported that the very basic chemical ingredients of life — the carbon - hydrogen molecule ( CH , or methylidyne radical ) , the carbon - hydrogen positive ion ( CH+ ) and the carbon ion ( C+)—are the result , in large part , of ultraviolet light from stars , rather than in other ways , such as the result of turbulent events related to supernovae and young stars , as thought earlier .
REACTIONS Section::::Reactions .
The C−H bond in general is very strong , so it is relatively unreactive .
In several compound classes , collectively called carbon acids , the C−H bond can be sufficiently acidic for proton removal .
Unactivated C−H bonds are found in alkanes and are not adjacent to a heteroatom ( O , N , Si , etc . ) .
Such bonds usually only participate in radical substitution .
Many enzymes are known , however , to affect these reactions .
Although the C−H bond is one of the strongest , it varies over 30 % in magnitude for fairly stable organic compounds , even in the absence of heteroatoms . !
