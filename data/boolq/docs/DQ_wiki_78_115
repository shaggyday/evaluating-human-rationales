THE INVINCIBLES ( FOOTBALL )
In English football , " The Invincibles " is a nickname that has been used to refer to the Preston North End team of the 1888–89 season , managed by William Sudell , and the Arsenal team of the 2003–04 season managed by Arsène Wenger .
Preston North End earned the nickname after completing an entire season undefeated in league and cup competition ( 27 games ) , while Arsenal were undefeated in the league only ( 38 games ) .
The actual nickname of the Preston team was the " Old Invincibles " , but both versions have been in use .
The term " Invincibles " has also been used elsewhere in European football .
Italian clubs Milan and Juventus received the nickname after winning the 1991–92 and 2011–12
Serie A titles respectively .
Celtic earned the nickname after going unbeaten across domestic league and cup competition during the 2016–17 season in Scotland .
PRESTON
NORTH END
Section::::Preston North End .
Preston North End became known as " The Old Invincibles " after they won the inaugural Football League competition in 1888–89 , completing the season unbeaten in both the league and the FA Cup , so becoming the first team ever to achieve the " Double " .
Preston 's league record was 18 wins , 4 draws and 0 losses , out of 22 games played , while their cup record was 5 wins out of 5 rounds played and they won the FA Cup without conceding a goal .
In his autobiography , Tom Finney wrote : " The championship stayed with North End — by now tagged the Old Invincibles — the following year , but runners - up spot had to suffice for the next three seasons " .
Preston 's unbeaten run stretched to one game the following season , their first league defeat came away to Aston Villa in the second game , losing 5–3 .
Of the seven teams to have completed the Double in England , Preston remain the only one to have done so unbeaten .
In 2008 , Preston opened a new 5,000 seater stand at their Deepdale stadium , named the Invincibles Pavilion in honour of the unbeaten 1880s team that had also played their home matches at the same site .
The Preston team that won the 1889 FA Cup Final at Kennington Oval , beating Wolverhampton Wanderers 3–0 , was as follows : valign="top " width="50 % " colspan="4 " ! width="25 " ! !

In May 2002 , Arsenal beat Manchester United to regain the Premier League and equal Preston 's record of not losing an away match all season .
In assessing the team 's achievement , Tim Rich of The Independent wrote : " Invincibles , they called the last team to go through a season unbeaten away from home , although it is a word which belongs far more to the Arsenal side of 2002 than it ever could to the Preston team of 1888–89 . "
Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger wanted his team to push on for more honours and described the defeat of Manchester United as a " shift of power " in English football .
The team began the following season in good stead ; a 4–1 win against Leeds United in September 2002 meant Arsenal broke the domestic record for scoring in consecutive games ( 47 ) , and away league games without defeat ( 22 ) .
Such was their effective start to the campaign , Wenger reiterated his belief that Arsenal could remain the whole season undefeated : Arsenal lost to Everton in October 2002 and failed to win their next three matches in all competitions , representing their worst run of form in 19 years .
By March 2003 , Arsenal had established themselves as league leaders , but nearest challenger Manchester United overhauled them to win the title .
Arsenal finished the season with league wins against Southampton and Sunderland and was later consoled with success in the FA Cup – they beat the former team 1–0 in the 2003 final .
Wenger sought to strengthen his team with minor additions :
goalkeeper Jens Lehmann , as well as a number of young players from academies abroad , namely Gaël Clichy and Phillipe Senderos .
In comparison to their rivals Chelsea , bankrolled by new owner Roman Abramovich , and Manchester United , Arsenal 's transfer activity was quiet .
The financial constraints that came with the Ashburton Grove stadium project meant Wenger had little income to spend on new players .
Once funding was found amidst the season , the club added to its roster , with José Antonio Reyes arriving in the winter transfer window .
In the 2003–04 season , Arsenal regained the Premier League without a single defeat .
Over the 38 games played , their league record stood at 26 wins , 12 draws and 0 losses .
The unbeaten run came close to ending six matches into the campaign against Manchester United , as striker Ruud van Nistelrooy missed a penalty in injury time ; the match then ended 0–0 .
At the turn of the calendar year , Arsenal won nine league matches in a row to consolidate first position ; they secured their status as champions with a draw against local rivals Tottenham Hotspur in April 2004 .
Their form did not continue into the domestic cups ; Arsenal exited the semi - final stage of the Football League Cup and the FA Cup to eventual winners Middlesbrough and Manchester United , respectively .
In Europe , Arsenal lost two of their opening three UEFA Champions League group stage matches , 3–0 at home to Internazionale and 2–1 away to Dynamo Kyiv , but eventually finished top of the group .
Arsenal ultimately reached the quarter - final stage of the Champions League , where they were eliminated by London rivals Chelsea .
Continuing into the next season , a special gold version of the Premier League trophy was commissioned to commemorate Arsenal winning the title without a single defeat .
In May 2018 , this gold trophy was presented to Arsene Wenger as a gift from Arsenal Football Club at Wenger 's final home game as manager after 22 years .
In addition to their two wins at the end of the 2002–03 FA Premier League , Arsenal beat Middlesbrough in their second league game of 2004–05 to equal Nottingham Forest 's record of 42 league matches unbeaten ; the feat was eclipsed with a win at home to Blackburn Rovers .
The run extended to six more matches for a total of 49 league games undefeated , before coming to an end with a controversial 2–0 defeat to Manchester United .
The Guardian noted that Arsenal never trailed in the last 20 minutes of a game during their unbeaten run .
FORMATION Section::::Formation .
The most used Arsenal players in the 2003–04 season , positioned in a 4–4–1–1 formation .
Compared with the club 's double - winning side of 1998 , only Patrick Vieira and Dennis Bergkamp remained as first team players throughout the unbeaten run ; Martin Keown and Ray Parlour featured briefly .
Defenders Lee Dixon and Tony Adams had retired from professional football in 2002 and goalkeeper David Seaman joined Manchester City a year later .
Kolo Touré , bought as a right - back and defensive midfielder , was chosen to play in central defence alongside Sol Campbell after impressing during pre - season .
Lauren who played as a midfielder for Real Mallorca was shifted as a right - back when he joined Arsenal .
Wenger initially replaced left - back Nigel Winterburn with Sylvinho , but an injury to the defender allowed Ashley Cole to take his place as first pick by the 2000–01 season .
In midfield Gilberto Silva partnered Vieira , and Fredrik Ljungberg and Robert Pires each played either side of the wing .
Thierry Henry , signed as Nicolas Anelka 's replacement in 1999 , was the team 's focal point in attack ; he was supported most often by Bergkamp .
Although the team were interpreted as one which organised themselves as 4–4–2 , the formation with the ball was akin to 4–4–1–1 .
Wenger 's tactics emphasised attacking football and relied on movement and interchanging , with full - backs joining in attacks .
Journalist Michael Cox noted Arsenal 's strengths lay on the left side of the pitch and added because the opposition focused on containing Cole , Pires and Henry , it allowed Lauren and Ljungberg to find space and cross the ball .
The team were also strong on the counter , exemplified in their away performances against Leeds United and Tottenham Hotspur .
