SOVIET UNION NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM
The Soviet Union national football team
( , ) was the national football team of the Soviet Union .
After the breakup of the Union the team was transformed into the CIS national football team ( a formality name for a team of the non - existing country of Soviet Union ) .
FIFA considers the CIS national football team ( and ultimately , the Russia national football team ) as the Soviet successor team allocating its former records to them ( except for the Olympic records which are not combined due to the IOC policy ) ; nevertheless , a large percentage of the team 's former players came from outside the Russian SFSR , mainly from the Ukrainian SSR , and following the breakup of the Soviet Union , some such as Andrei Kanchelskis from the former Ukrainian SSR , continued to play in the new Russia national football team .
The Soviet Union failed to qualify for the World Cup only twice , in 1974 and 1978 , and attended seven finals tournaments in total .
Their best finish was fourth in 1966 , when they lost to West Germany in the semifinals , 2–1 .
The Soviet Union qualified for five European Championships , winning the inaugural competition in 1960 when they beat Yugoslavia in the final , 2–1 .
They finished second three times ( 1964 , 1972 , 1988 ) , and fourth once ( 1968 ) , when , having drawn with Italy in the semi - final , they were sent to the third place playoff match by the loss of a coin toss .
The Soviet Union national team also participated in number of Olympic tournaments earning the gold medal in the 1956 and 1988 .
The Soviet team continued to field its national team players in Olympic tournaments despite the prohibition of FIFA in 1958 to field any national team players in Olympics .
However , in 1960 and in 1964 the Soviets were fielding its second national team .
HISTORY FIRST GAMES Section::::History .
Section::::First games .
The first international match played by a Soviet team came in September 1922 , when the Finnish Workers ' Sports Federation football team toured Russia .
The Soviet XI scored a 4–1 victory over the Finns in Petrograd .
This was also the first international contact for Soviet sports after the 1917 October Revolution .
In May 1923 , the Soviet team visited Finland and beat the Finnish squad 5–0 .
The first match against national team was played in August 1923 , nine months after the establishment of the Soviet Union , when a Russian SFSR team beat Sweden 2–1 in Stockholm .
The first formally recognised match played by the Soviet Union took place a year later , a 3–0 win over Turkey .
This and a return match in Ankara were the only officially recognised international matches played by the Soviet Union prior to the 1952 Summer Olympics , though several unofficial friendlies against Turkey took place in the 1930s .
The 1952 Olympics was the first competitive tournament entered by the Soviet Union .
In the preliminary round , Bulgaria were defeated 2–1 , earning a first round tie against Yugoslavia .
Before the match , both Tito and Stalin sent telegrams to their national teams , which showed just how important it was for the two head of states .
Yugoslavia led 5–1 , but a Soviet comeback in the last 15 minutes resulted in a 5–5 draw .
The match was replayed , Yugoslavia winning 3–1 .
The defeat to the archrivals hit Soviet football hard , and after just three games played in the season , CDKA Moscow , who had made up most of the USSR squad , was forced to withdraw from the league and later disbanded .
Furthermore , Boris Arkadiev , who coached both USSR and CDKA , was stripped of his Merited Master of Sports of the USSR title .
SWEDEN TRIALS AND THE TRIUMPH Section::::Sweden trials and the triumph .
The Soviet Union entered the World Cup for the first time at the 1958 tournament , following a qualification playoff against Poland .
Drawn in a group with Brazil , England and Austria , they collected three points in total , one from England and two from Austria .
Soviet Union and England went to a playoff game , in which Anatoli Ilyin scored in the 67th minute to knock England out .
The Soviet Union were then eliminated by the hosts of the tournament , Sweden , in the quarter - finals .
The inaugural European Championships in 1960 marked the pinnacle of Soviet footballing achievement .
Easily progressing to the quarter - finals , the team were scheduled to face Spain , but due to the tensions of the Cold War , Spain refused to travel to the Soviet Union , resulting in a walkover .
In the semi - final , the Soviet team defeated Czechoslovakia 3–0 and reached the final , where they faced Yugoslavia .
In the final , Yugoslavia scored first , but the Soviet Union , led by legendary goalkeeper Lev Yashin , equalized in the 49th minute .
After 90 minutes the score was 1–1 , and Viktor Ponedelnik scored with seven minutes left in extra time to give the Soviets the inaugural European Championship .
THE END OF KACHALIN 'S DREAM - TEAM
Section::::The end of Kachalin 's dream - team .
In the 1962 World Cup , the Soviet team was in Group 1 with Yugoslavia , Colombia and Uruguay .
The match between Soviet Union and Colombia ended 4–4 ; Colombia scored a series of goals ( 68 ' , 72 ' , 86 ' ) .
Star goalkeeper Lev Yashin was in poor form both against Colombia and Chile .
His form was considered as one of the main reasons why Soviet Union team did not gain more success in the tournament .
In 1964 , the Soviet Union attempted to defend their European Championship title , defeating Italy in the last 16 ( 2–0 , 1–1 ) and to reach the quarter - finals .
After two matches against Sweden , the Soviet side won on aggregate ( 1–1 , 3–1 ) .
The Soviet Union team went to Spain where the finals were held .
In the semi - finals , the Soviet Union defeated Denmark 3–0 in Barcelona but their dreams of winning the title again were dashed in the final when Spain , the host , scored a late goal , winning a 2 - 1 .
THE LATE 1960S : SEMI - FINALS AT WORLD CUP AND EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS Section::::The late 1960s : Semi - finals at World Cup and European Championships .
The 1966 FIFA World Cup was the tournament which the Soviet Union team reached their best result by finishing in fourth place .
Soviet Union was in Group 4 with North Korea , Italy and Chile .
In all three matches , the Soviet Union team managed to defeat their rivals .
The Soviet team then defeated Hungary in the quarter - finals thanks to the effective performance of their star , Lev Yashin but their success was ended by two defeats on 25 and 28 July , against West Germany in the semi - finals and Portugal in the third place
play off match , respectively .
The 1966 squad was the second best scoring Soviet team in the World Cup history , with 10 goals .
For the Euro 1968 , the qualification competition was played in two stages ; a group stage ( taking place from 1966 until 1968 ) and the quarter - finals ( played in 1968 ) .
Again , only four teams could reach the finals which were held in Italy .
The semi - final match between Soviet Union and Italy ended 0–0 .
It was decided to toss a coin to see who reached the final , rather than play a replay .
Italy won , and went on to become European champions .
On 8 June 1968 , the Soviets were defeated by England in the third place match .
KACHALIN 'S SECOND ATTEMPT Section::::Kachalin 's second attempt .
The 1970 World Cup started with the match between Mexico and the Soviet Union .
The Soviet team became the first team to make a substitution in World Cup history in this match .
Other opponents in their group were Belgium and El Salvador .
The Soviet team easily qualified to the quarter - final where they lost against Uruguay in extra time .
This was the last time the Soviet Union reached the quarter - finals .
They were able to obtain 5th place in the rankings which FIFA released in 1986 .
The final tournament of the 1972 European Championships took place between 14 and 18 June 1972 .
Again , only four teams were in the finals .
Soviets defeated Hungary 1–0 , a second half goal .
The final was between West Germany and Soviet Union .
The match ended with a victory of the German side thanks to the effective football of Gerd Müller .
This tournament was one of the two tournaments in which the Soviet Union finished as runner - up .
FAILURES TO QUALIFY IN THE 1970S
Section::::Failures to qualify in the 1970s .
After being runners up at Euro 1972 , the rest of the 1970s were bleak for the Soviets , who were disqualified from the 1974 World Cup as a result of refusal to play Chile in the aftermath of the 1973 Chilean coup d'état , and failed to qualify for the 1978 World Cup or the 1976 and 1980 European Championships .
BESKOV RECOVERS THE TEAM
Section::::Beskov recovers the team .
The 1982 World Cup was the Soviet Union 's first major tournament appearance for a decade .
The Soviet Union was in Group 6 with Brazil , Scotland and New Zealand .
Goals by Socrates and Eder marked the defeat of the Soviet side against Brazil in the first group match ( even though it was a very hard match for the Brazilians ) , and they were eventually eliminated in the second round by finishing the group in second place , when they defeated Belgium only 1–0 and drew against Poland with an 0–0 result .
In 1984 , the Soviets again failed to qualify for the European Championships , but succeeded in qualifying for the 1986 World Cup .
Soviet Union were in Group C with Hungary , France and Canada .
The Soviets used Irapuato , Guanajuato as their training ground in the World Cup .
LOBANOVSKY ERA AND DEMISE OF SOVIET UNION
Section::::Lobanovsky era and demise of Soviet Union .
Soviet team enjoyed a successful group stage by scoring nine goals and finishing the group in the first place .
It seemed like the Soviet side managed to forget their unsuccessful performance in 1982 , but they lost to surprise package Belgium 3–4 in the round of 16 after extra time .
Despite their poor performance in the cup , this team was the best scoring Soviet team in World Cup history , with 12 goals .
After failing to qualify for three consecutive Europe Cups ( 1976 , 1980 , 1984 ) , the Soviets managed to qualify for the 1988 competition , the last time the Soviet Union national football team took part in the European Football Championship .
The finals were held in West Germany .
Eight teams were participating this time .
Soviet Union finished Group B as leaders above the Netherlands and reached the semi - finals .
There , the Soviets defeated Italy 2–0 .
In the final between Soviet Union and the Netherlands , another team from Group B , the Netherlands won the match with a clear score and became the European champions .
The final major championship contested by the Soviet team was the 1990 FIFA World Cup , where they were drawn in Group B with Argentina , Romania and Cameroon .
The only success of Soviet Union in the whole tournament came when they managed to beat the group leaders , Cameroon by 4–0 .
The Soviet team lost their other matches and failed to qualify from the group .
The Soviet Union qualified for Euro 1992 , but the breakup of the Soviet Union meant that the finals place was instead taken by the CIS national football team .
After the tournament , the former Soviet Republics competed as separate independent nations , with FIFA allocating the Soviet team 's record to Russia .
