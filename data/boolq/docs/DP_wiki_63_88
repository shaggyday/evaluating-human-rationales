1986 NBA PLAYOFFS
The 1986 NBA Playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association 's 1985–86 season .
The tournament concluded with the Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics defeating the Western Conference champion Houston Rockets 4 games to 2 in the NBA Finals .
Larry Bird was named NBA Finals MVP for the second time .
This was the second NBA Finals meeting between the Celtics and Rockets ; they met in the 1981 NBA Finals with the same result .
It was the third of four straight Eastern Conference championships for Boston , who won 67 games that year , and went 40–1 at home .
The Rockets , meanwhile had won just their second conference title in franchise history .
Second - year player Michael Jordan put on a record - setting performance in Game 2 of the Bulls ' first - round series against the Celtics , scoring 63 points in a 2-OT loss , which surpassed Elgin Baylor 's 61-point performance from the 1962 NBA Finals and still stands as the NBA Playoff scoring record .
Jordan averaged 44.7 points per game in the series , but was unable to prevent the Bulls from being swept by a more experienced , more talented Celtics team .
The Bulls set a dubious mark by posting the second worst record for a playoff - qualifying team in history , going just 30–52 during the season .
Game 2 , where the record was set , was ranked by TV Guide as the 26th Most Memorable Moment in Television History , and is credited with boosting the NBA 's popularity surge and eventual rise to near the top of the United States television sports market , trailing only football by the mid-90s .
The 1986 playoffs marked the third time in four years that the Milwaukee Bucks advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals , but it would be their last appearance in the series until 2001 .
The Celtics avenged their 1983 sweep by sweeping the Bucks in four games .
As for the Philadelphia 76ers , this was the last time they would play in a Game 7 until 2001 .
After their first round loss to the Atlanta Hawks , the Detroit Pistons would advance past the first round in each of the next five seasons ( 1987 , 1988 , 1989 , 1990 , 1991 ) , which include all appearances in the conference finals , three NBA Finals , and two championships .
