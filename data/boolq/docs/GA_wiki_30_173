ACTOR
An actor is a person who portrays a character in a performance ( also actress ; see below ) .
The actor performs " in the flesh " in the traditional medium of the theatre or in modern media such as film , radio , and television .
The analogous Greek term is ( ) , literally " one who answers " .
The actor 's interpretation of their role — the art of acting — pertains to the role played , whether based on a real person or fictional character .
Interpretation occurs even when the actor is " playing themselves " , as in some forms of experimental performance art .
Formerly , in ancient Greece and Rome , the medieval world , and the time of William Shakespeare , only men could become actors , and women 's roles were generally played by men or boys .
After the English Restoration of 1660 , women began to appear on stage in England .
In modern times , particularly in pantomime and some operas , women occasionally play the roles of boys or young men .
THE TERM ACTRESS Section::::The term actress .
After 1660 in England , when women first started to appear on stage , the terms actor or actress were initially used interchangeably for female performers , but later , influenced by the French , actress became the commonly used term for women in theater and film .
The etymology is a simple derivation from actor with added .
When referring to groups of performers of both sexes , actors is preferred .
Actor is also used before the full name of a performer as a gender - specific term .
Within the profession , the re - adoption of the neutral term dates to the post - war period of the 1950 and ' 60s , when the contributions of women to cultural life in general were being reviewed .
When The Observer and The Guardian published their new joint style guide in 2010 , it stated " Use [ ' actor ' ] for both male and female actors ; do not use actress except when in name of award , e.g. Oscar for best actress .
" The guide 's authors stated that " actress comes into the same category as authoress , comedienne , manageress , '
lady doctor ' , ' male nurse ' and similar
obsolete terms that date from a time when professions were largely the preserve of one sex ( usually men ) .
" ( See male as norm ) . "
As Whoopi Goldberg put it in an interview with the paper : ' An actress can only play a woman .
I 'm an actor – I can play anything .
The UK performers ' union Equity has no policy on the use of " actor " or " actress " .
An Equity spokesperson said that the union does not believe that there is a consensus on the matter and stated that the " ... subject divides the profession " .
In 2009 , the Los Angeles Times stated that " Actress " remains the common term used in major acting awards given to female recipients ( e.g. , Academy Award for Best Actress ) .
With regard to the cinema of the United States , the gender - neutral term " player " was common in film in the silent film era and the early days of the Motion Picture Production Code , but in the 2000s in a film context , it is generally deemed archaic .
However , " player " remains in use in the theatre , often incorporated into the name of a theatre group or company , such as the American Players , the East West Players , etc .
Also , actors in improvisational theatre may be referred to as " players " .
PAY EQUITY Section::::Pay equity .
In 2015 , Forbes reported that " ... just 21 of the 100 top - grossing films of 2014 featured a female lead or co - lead , while only 28.1 % of characters in 100 top - grossing films were female ... " .
" In the U.S. , there is an " industry - wide [ gap ] in salaries of all scales .
On average , white women get paid 78 cents to every dollar a white man makes , while Hispanic women earn 56 cents to a white male 's dollar , Black women 64 cents and Native American women just 59 cents to that .
" Forbes ' analysis of US acting salaries in 2013 determined that the " ... men on Forbes ' list of top - paid actors for that year made 2 times as much money as the top - paid actresses .
That means that Hollywood 's best - compensated actresses made just 40 cents for every dollar that the best - compensated men made . "
HISTORY Section::::History .
The first recorded case of a performing actor occurred in 534 BC ( though the changes in calendar over the years make it hard to determine exactly ) when the Greek performer Thespis stepped onto the stage at the Theatre Dionysus to become the first known person to speak words as a character in a play or story .
Prior to Thespis ' act , Grecian stories were only expressed in song , dance , and in third person narrative .
In honor of Thespis , actors are commonly called Thespians .
The exclusively male actors in the theatre of ancient Greece performed in three types of drama : tragedy , comedy , and the satyr play .
Western theatre developed and expanded considerably under the Romans .
The theatre of ancient Rome was a thriving and diverse art form , ranging from festival performances of street theatre , nude dancing , and acrobatics , to the staging of situation comedies , to high - style , verbally elaborate tragedies .
As the Western Roman Empire fell into decay through the 4th and 5th centuries , the seat of Roman power shifted to Constantinople and the Byzantine Empire .
Records show that mime , pantomime , scenes or recitations from tragedies and comedies , dances , and other entertainments were very popular .
From the 5th century , Western Europe was plunged into a period of general disorder .
Small nomadic bands of actors traveled around Europe throughout the period , performing wherever they could find an audience ; there is no evidence that they produced anything but crude scenes .
Traditionally , actors were not of high status ; therefore , in the Early Middle Ages , traveling acting troupes were often viewed with distrust .
Early Middle Ages actors were denounced by the Church during the Dark Ages , as they were viewed as dangerous , immoral , and pagan .
In many parts of Europe , traditional beliefs of the region and time period meant actors could not receive a Christian burial .
In the Early Middle Ages , churches in Europe began staging dramatized versions of biblical events .
By the middle of the 11th century , liturgical drama had spread from Russia to Scandinavia to Italy .
The Feast of Fools encouraged the development of comedy .
In the Late Middle Ages , plays were produced in 127 towns .
These vernacular Mystery plays often contained comedy , with actors playing devils , villains , and clowns .
The majority of actors in these plays were drawn from the local population .
Amateur performers in England were exclusively male , but other countries had female performers .
There were a number of secular plays staged in the Middle Ages , the earliest of which is The Play of the Greenwood by Adam de la Halle in 1276 .
It contains satirical scenes and folk material such as faeries and other supernatural occurrences .
Farces also rose dramatically in popularity after the 13th century .
At the end of the Late Middle Ages , professional actors began to appear in England and Europe .
Richard III and Henry VII both maintained small companies of professional actors .
Beginning in the mid-16th century , Commedia dell'arte troupes performed lively improvisational playlets across Europe for centuries .
Commedia dell'arte was an actor - centred theatre , requiring little scenery and very few props .
Plays were loose frameworks that provided situations , complications , and outcome of the action , around which the actors improvised .
The plays utilised stock characters .
A troupe typically consisted of 13 to 14 members .
Most actors were paid a share of the play 's profits roughly equivalent to the sizes of their roles .
Renaissance theatre derived from several medieval theatre traditions , such as the mystery plays , " morality plays " , and the " university drama " that attempted to recreate Athenian tragedy .
The Italian tradition of Commedia dell'arte , as well as the elaborate masques frequently presented at court , also contributed to the shaping of public theatre .
Since before the reign of Elizabeth I , companies of players were attached to households of leading aristocrats and performed seasonally in various locations .
These became the foundation for the professional players that performed on the Elizabethan stage .
The development of the theatre and opportunities for acting ceased when Puritan opposition to the stage banned the performance of all plays within London .
Puritans viewed the theatre as immoral .
The re - opening of the theatres in 1660 signaled a renaissance of English drama .
English comedies written and performed in the Restoration period from 1660 to 1710 are collectively called " Restoration comedy " .
Restoration comedy is notorious for its sexual explicitness .
At this point , women were allowed for the first time to appear on the English stage , exclusively in female roles .
This period saw the introduction of the first professional actresses and the rise of the first celebrity actors .
19TH CENTURY Section::::19th century .
In the 19th century , the negative reputation of actors was largely reversed , and acting became an honored , popular profession and art .
The rise of the actor as celebrity provided the transition , as audiences flocked to their favorite " stars " .
A new role emerged for the actor - managers , who formed their own companies and controlled the actors , the productions , and the financing .
When successful , they built up a permanent clientele that flocked to their productions .
They could enlarge their audience by going on tour across the country , performing a repertoire of well - known plays , such as those by Shakespeare .
The newspapers , private clubs , pubs , and coffee shops rang with lively debates evaluating the relative merits of the stars and the productions .
Henry Irving ( 1838 - 1905 ) was the most successful of the British actor - managers .
Irving was renowned for his Shakespearean roles , and for such innovations as turning out the house lights so that attention could focus more on the stage and less on the audience .
His company toured across Britain , as well as Europe and the United States , demonstrating the power of star actors and celebrated roles to attract enthusiastic audiences .
His knighthood in 1895 indicated full acceptance into the higher circles of British society .
20TH CENTURY Section::::20th century .
By the early 20th century , the economics of large - scale productions displaced the actor - manager model .
It was too hard to find people who combined a genius at acting as well as management , so specialization divided the roles as stage managers and later theatre directors emerged .
Financially , much larger capital was required to operate out of a major city .
The solution was corporate ownership of chains of theatres , such as by the Theatrical Syndicate , Edward Laurillard , and especially The Shubert Organization .
By catering to tourists , theaters in large cities increasingly favored long runs of highly popular plays , especially musicals .
Big name stars became even more essential .
TECHNIQUES
* Classical acting is an umbrella term for a philosophy of acting that integrates the expression of the body , voice , imagination , personalizing , improvisation , external stimuli , and script analysis .
It is based on the theories and systems of select classical actors and directors including Konstantin Stanislavski and Michel Saint - Denis .
*
In Stanislavski 's system , also known as Stanislavski 's method , actors draw upon their own feelings and experiences to convey the " truth " of the character they portray .
Actors puts themselves in the mindset of the character , finding things in common to give a more genuine portrayal of the character .
* Method acting is a range of techniques based on for training actors to achieve better characterizations of the characters they play , as formulated by Lee Strasberg .
Strasberg 's method is based upon the idea that to develop an emotional and cognitive understanding of their roles , actors should use their own experiences to identify personally with their characters .
It is based on aspects of Stanislavski 's system .
Other acting techniques are also based on Stanislavski 's ideas , such as those of Stella Adler and Sanford Meisner , but these are not considered " method acting " .
*
Meisner technique requires the actor to focus totally on the other actor as though he or she is real and they only exist in that moment .
This is a method that makes the actors in the scene seem more authentic to the audience .
It is based on the principle that acting finds its expression in people 's response to other people and circumstances .
Is it based on Stanislavski 's system .
AS OPPOSITE SEX Section::::As opposite sex .
Formerly , in some societies , only men could become actors .
In ancient Greece and ancient Rome and the medieval world , it was considered disgraceful for a woman to go on stage ; this belief persisted until the 17th century in Venice .
In the time of William Shakespeare , women 's roles were generally played by men or boys .
When an eighteen - year Puritan prohibition of drama was lifted after the English Restoration of 1660 , women began to appear on stage in England .
Margaret Hughes is oft credited as the first professional actress on the English stage .
This prohibition ended during the reign of Charles II in part because he enjoyed watching actresses on stage .
Specifically , Charles II issued letters patent to Thomas Killigrew and William Davenant , granting them the monopoly right to form two London theatre companies to perform " serious " drama , and the letters patent were reissued in 1662 with revisions allowing actresses to perform for the first time .
The first occurrence of the term actress was in 1608 according to the OED and is ascribed to Middleton .
In the 19th century many viewed women in acting negatively , as actresses were often courtesans and associated with promiscuity .
Despite these prejudices , the 19th century also saw the first female acting " stars " , most notably Sarah Bernhardt .
In Japan , onnagata , men taking on female roles , were used in kabuki theatre when women were banned from performing on stage during the Edo period .
This convention continues .
By contrast , some forms of Chinese drama involve women playing all roles .
In modern times , women occasionally played the roles of boys or young men .
For example , the stage role of Peter Pan is traditionally played by a woman , as are most principal boys in British pantomime .
Opera has several " breeches roles " traditionally sung by women , usually mezzo - sopranos .
Examples are Hansel in Hänsel und Gretel , Cherubino in The Marriage of Figaro and Octavian in Der Rosenkavalier .
Women playing male roles are uncommon in film , with notable exceptions .
In 1982 , Stina Ekblad played the mysterious Ismael Retzinsky in Fanny and Alexander , and Linda Hunt received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for playing Billy Kwan in The Year of Living Dangerously .
In 2007 , Cate Blanchett was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for playing Jude Quinn , a fictionalized representation of Bob Dylan in the 1960s , in I 'm Not There .
In the 2000s , women playing men in live theatre is particularly common in presentations of older plays , such as Shakespearean works with large numbers of male characters in roles where gender is inconsequential .
Having an actor dress as the opposite sex for comic effect is also a long - standing tradition in comic theatre and film .
Most of Shakespeare 's comedies include instances of overt cross - dressing , such as Francis Flute in A Midsummer Night 's Dream .
The movie A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum stars Jack Gilford dressing as a young bride .
Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon famously posed as women to escape gangsters in the Billy Wilder film
Some Like It
Hot .
Cross - dressing for comic effect was a frequently used device in most of the Carry On films .
Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams have each appeared in a hit comedy film ( Tootsie and Mrs. Doubtfire , respectively ) in which they played most scenes dressed as a woman .
Occasionally , the issue is further complicated , for example , by a woman playing a woman acting as a man — who then pretends to be a woman , such as Julie Andrews in Victor / Victoria , or Gwyneth Paltrow in Shakespeare in Love .
In , filmwatchers never learn the gender of the androgynous main characters Pat and Chris ( played by Julia Sweeney and Dave Foley ) .
Similarly , in the aforementioned example of The Marriage of Figaro , there is a scene in which Cherubino ( a male character portrayed by a woman ) dresses up and acts as a woman ; the other characters in the scene are aware of a single level of gender role obfuscation , while the audience is aware of two levels .
A few modern roles are played by a member of the opposite sex in order to emphasize the gender fluidity of the role .
Edna Turnblad in Hairspray was played by Divine in the 1988 original film , Harvey Fierstein in the Broadway musical , and John Travolta in the 2007 movie musical .
Felicity Huffman was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for playing Bree Osbourne ( a male - to - female transsexual ) in 2005 's Transamerica .
TYPES Section::::Types .
Actors working in theatre , film , television and radio have to learn specific skills .
Techniques that work well in one type of acting may not work well in another type of acting .
IN THEATRE Section::::In theatre .
To act on stage , actors need to learn the stage directions that appear in the script , such as " Stage Left " and " Stage Right " .
These directions are based on the actor 's point of view as he or she stands on the stage facing the audience .
Actors also have to learn the meaning of the stage directions " Upstage " ( away from the audience ) and " Downstage " ( towards the audience )
Theatre actors need to learn blocking , which is " ...
where and how an actor moves on the stage during a play " .
Most scripts specify some blocking .
The Director also gives instructions on blocking , such as crossing the stage or picking up and using a prop .
Some theater actors need to learn stage combat , which is simulated fighting on stage .
Actors may have to simulate hand - to - hand [ fighting ] or sword[-fighting ] .
Actors are coached by fight directors , who help them learn the choreographed sequence of fight actions .

SILENT FILMS Section::::In film .
Section::::Silent films .
From 1894 to the late 1920s , movies were silent films .
Silent film actors emphasized body language and facial expression , so that the audience could better understand what an actor was feeling and portraying on screen .
Much silent film acting is apt to strike modern - day audiences as simplistic or campy .
The melodramatic acting style was in some cases a habit actors transferred from their former stage experience .
Vaudeville theatre was an especially popular origin for many American silent film actors .
The pervading presence of stage actors in film was the cause of this outburst from director Marshall Neilan in 1917 : " The sooner the stage people who have come into pictures get out , the better for the pictures .
" In other cases , directors such as John Griffith Wray required their actors to deliver larger - than - life expressions for emphasis .
As early as 1914 , American viewers had begun to make known their preference for greater naturalness on screen .
Pioneering film directors in Europe and the United States recognized the different limitations and freedoms of the mediums of stage and screen by the early 1910s .
Silent films became less vaudevillian in the mid 1910s , as the differences between stage and screen became apparent .
Due to the work of directors such as D W Griffith , cinematography became less stage - like , and the then - revolutionary close up shot allowed subtle and naturalistic acting .
In America , D.W. Griffith 's company Biograph Studios , became known for its innovative direction and acting , conducted suit the cinema rather than the stage .
Griffith realized that theatrical acting did not look good on film and required his actors and actresses to go through weeks of film acting training .
Lillian Gish has been called film 's " first true actress " for her work in the period , as she pioneered new film performing techniques , recognizing the crucial differences between stage and screen acting .
Directors such as Albert Capellani and Maurice Tourneur began to insist on naturalism in their films .
By the mid-1920s many American silent films had adopted a more naturalistic acting style , though not all actors and directors accepted naturalistic , low - key acting straight away ; as late as 1927 , films featuring expressionistic acting styles , such as Metropolis , were still being released .
According to Anton Kaes , a silent film scholar from the University of Wisconsin , American silent cinema began to see a shift in acting techniques between 1913 and 1921 , influenced by techniques found in German silent film .
This is mainly attributed to the influx of emigrants from the Weimar Republic , " including film directors , producers , cameramen , lighting and stage technicians , as well as actors and actresses " .
ADVENT OF SOUND IN FILM Section::::Advent of sound in film .
Film actors have to learn to get used to and be comfortable with a camera being in front of them .
Film actors need to learn to find and stay on their " mark .
" This is a position on the floor marked with tape .
This position is where the lights and camera focus are optimized .
Film actors also need to learn how to prepare well and perform well on screen tests .
Screen tests are a filmed audition of part of the script .
Unlike theater actors , who develop characters for repeat performances , film actors lack continuity , forcing them to come to all scenes ( sometimes shot in reverse of the order in which they ultimately appear ) with a fully developed character already .
" Since film captures even the smallest gesture and magnifies it ... , cinema demands a less flamboyant and stylized bodily performance from the actor than does the theater . "
" The performance of emotion is the most difficult aspect of film acting to master : ...
the film actor must rely on subtle facial ticks , quivers , and tiny lifts of the eyebrow to create a believable character .
" Some theatre stars " ... have made the theater - to - cinema transition quite successfully ( Laurence Olivier , Glenn Close , and Julie Andrews , for instance ) , others have not ...
" IN TELEVISION Section::::In television .
" On a television set , there are typically several cameras angled at the set .
Actors who are new to on - screen acting can get confused about which camera to look into . "
TV actors need to learn to use lav mics ( Lavaliere microphones ) .
TV actors need to understand the concept of " frame " .
" The term frame refers to the area that the camera 's lens is capturing . "
Within the acting industry , there are four types of television roles one could land on a show .
Each type varies in prominence , frequency of appearance , and pay .
The first is known as a series regular — the main actors on the show as part of the permanent cast .
Actors in recurring roles are under contract to appear in multiple episodes of a series .
A co - star role is a small speaking role that usually only appears in one episode .
A guest star is a larger role than a co - star role , and the character is often the central focus of the episode or integral to the plot .
IN RADIO Section::::In radio .
Radio drama is a dramatized , purely acoustic performance , broadcast on radio or published on audio media , such as tape or CD .
With no visual component , radio drama depends on dialogue , music and sound effects to help the listener imagine the characters and story : " It is auditory in the physical dimension but equally powerful as a visual force in the psychological dimension . "
Radio drama achieved widespread popularity within a decade of its initial development in the 1920s .
By the 1940s , it was a leading international popular entertainment .
With the advent of television in the 1950s , however , radio drama lost some of its popularity , and in some countries has never regained large audiences .
However , recordings of OTR ( old - time radio ) survive today in the audio archives of collectors and museums , as well as several online sites such as Internet Archive . , radio drama has a minimal presence on terrestrial radio in the United States .
Much of American radio drama is restricted to rebroadcasts or podcasts of programs from previous decades .
However , other nations still have thriving traditions of radio drama .
In the United Kingdom , for example , the BBC produces and broadcasts hundreds of new radio plays each year on Radio 3 , Radio 4 , and Radio 4 Extra .
Podcasting has also offered the means of creating new radio dramas , in addition to the distribution of vintage programs .
The terms " audio drama " or " audio theatre " are sometimes used synonymously with " radio drama " with one possible distinction : audio drama or audio theatre may not necessarily be intended specifically for broadcast on radio .
Audio drama , whether newly produced or OTR classics , can be found on CDs , cassette tapes , podcasts , webcasts and conventional broadcast radio .
Thanks to advances in digital recording and Internet distribution , radio drama is experiencing a revival .
