SOUTH KOREA NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM
The Korea Republic national football team ( ) represents South Korea in international association football and is organised by the Korea Football Association .
Since the 1960s , South Korea has emerged as a major football power in Asia and is historically the most successful Asian football team , having participated in nine consecutive and ten overall FIFA World Cup tournaments , the most for any Asian country .
Despite initially going through five World Cup tournaments without winning a match , South Korea became the first and currently only Asian team to reach the semi - final stages when they co - hosted the 2002 tournament with Japan .
They have since improved their ability to play on foreign soil and were able to reach the Round of 16 in the 2010 World Cup .
South Korea won the first two AFC Asian Cup tournaments though they have been unable to win since , finishing second in 1972 , 1980 , 1988 , and 2015 , and third in 1964 , 2000 , 2007 , and 2011 .
They also took the gold medal at the 1970 , 1978 , and 1986 Asian Games .
They have qualified for every FIFA World Cup since 1986 .
The team is commonly nicknamed " The Reds " by both fans and the media due to the color of their primary kit .
The national team 's supporting group is officially referred to as the Red Devils .
HISTORY EARLY YEARS Section::::History .
Section::::Early years .
Korea was not introduced to football until the late 1800s ; it is often said that soccer in Korea dates to 1882 , when British sailors from played a game while their vessel was visiting the Incheon Port .
Korea became a Japanese colony in 1905 and was annexed by force in 1910 .
In 1921 , the first All Korea Football Tournament was held , and in 1928 , the Joseon Football Association ( JFA ) was organized , which created a foundation to disseminate and develop football in Korea .
Korean teams participated in competitions with Japanese teams from around 1926 ; Joseon Football Club became a de facto national team for Koreans , and won the 1935 Japanese national championship .
Koreans also played on the Japanese national team , most notably Kim Yong - sik who played for Japan at the 1936 Summer Olympics ; Japan 's last prewar national team in 1940 had two Korean players , Kim Yong - sik and Kim Sung - gan .
The JFA was reorganized in 1945 as Japanese colonial rule ended with the close of World War II .
Following the establishment of the South Korean state in the late 1940s , a new Korea Football Association ( KFA ) was founded in 1948 and joined FIFA , the international football governing body .
The same year , the South Korean national team made its international debut at the Olympic Games in London .
The KFA joined the AFC ( Asian Football Confederation ) in 1954 .
1954–1989
Section::::1954–1989 .
South Korea first entered the World Cup in 1954 as the second Asian team ever to compete in the World Cup after the Dutch East Indies ( Indonesia ) .
South Korea played games against Hungary and Turkey , losing 9–0 and 7–0 respectively ( the game scheduled against West Germany was never played because neither were seeded in their group , as per that tournament 's rules ) .
It would take thirty - two years before South Korea was able to participate in the World Cup finals again .
South Korea would later participate in the first Asian Cup in 1956 .
They drew with Hong Kong but defeated Israel and South Vietnam to take first place .
They hosted and won the second Asian Cup in 1960 , winning all of their games .
However , they failed to repeat this success and lost all their games in the 1964 Asian Cup and failed to qualify in 1968 .
They recovered in 1972 and took second place .
They once again failed to qualify in 1976 but reached second place again in 1980 .
In 1986 , South Korea was able to qualify for the 1986 FIFA World Cup , held in Mexico , for the first time since 1954 .
They , however , failed to win a game despite the presence of Cha Bum - kun , at the time one of the best Asian players , losing 3–1 to Argentina , drawing 1–1 with Bulgaria , and losing 3–2 to Italy .
Their next major tournament was the 1988 AFC Asian Cup , in which they won all their games in the group stage and defeated China 2–1 in the semi - finals but lost on penalties 4–3 in the final against Saudi Arabia .
1990–2001
Section::::1990–2001 .
South Korea started the 1990s poorly .
At the 1990 FIFA World Cup , they lost all their games against Spain 3–1 , Uruguay 1–0 , and Belgium 2–0 .
South Korea failed to qualify for the 1992 Asian Cup as well .
In the 1994 FIFA World Cup they managed to draw with Spain 2–2 .
Hong Myung - bo scored a goal and assisted teammate Seo Jung - won with the second , with both goals occurring in the last five minutes of the game .
In their next game they earned another draw with Bolivia 0–0 .
In their last game against Germany they nearly managed another draw with Hwang Sun - hong and Hong Myung - bo each scoring a goal in the second half after being down 3–0
but they were unable to score thereafter and were defeated 3–2 .
In the 1996 Asian Cup they barely managed to make it out of the group stage as they ranked third on their group , losing to Kuwait on goal difference .
A comparison made between all the third ranked teams in each group allowed South Korea to advance .
However , they suffered a 2–6 loss to Iran in the quarter - finals , conceding five goals in the second half .
Afterwards , former South Korean legend Cha Bum - kun became the head coach going into the 1998 FIFA World Cup .
Performing well in the qualification , the team played poorly in the tournament , losing to Mexico 3–1 and the Netherlands 5–0 .
Cha was sacked after the loss to the Netherlands .
The team then managed a 1–1 draw against Belgium .
In the 2000 AFC Asian Cup , South Korea managed to advance out of the group stage and defeated Iran 2–1 in the quarter - finals but were beaten by Saudi Arabia 2–1 in the semi - finals .
They defeated China 1–0 to gain third - place .
SEMIFINALISTS :
2002
WORLD CUP
Section::::Semifinalists : 2002 World Cup .
South Korea co - hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup tournament with Japan .
As they had never won a game in the World Cup previously , hopes were not very high .
In addition there was pre - tournament criticism concerning Dutch coach Guus Hiddink , who many felt did not take his job seriously .
However once the tournament began the South Korean team achieved their first ever victory in a World Cup with a 2–0 victory against Poland .
Their next game was against the United States and earned a 1–1 draw , with striker Ahn Jung - hwan scoring a late game equalizer .
Their last game was against the favored Portuguese side .
Portugal earned two red cards in the match , reducing them to nine men and Park Ji - sung scored the winning goal in a 1–0 victory , allowing the South Korean team to qualify for the second round for the first time in their history .
The team 's success led to widespread euphoria from the Korean public , with many people joining the Red Devils , which gained widespread attention with their passionate support of the team .
South Korea 's second round opponents were Italy , who they defeated 2–1 in a very physical match .
The Korean team was awarded an early penalty but Ahn Jung - hwan 's effort was saved by Italian keeper Gianluigi Buffon .
Christian Vieri then scored to put Italy ahead but Seol Ki - hyeon scored an equalizer in the 88th minute , allowing the game to go through to extra time .
Francesco Totti was controversially sent off for an alleged dive and Ahn redeemed his missed penalty by scoring the winner with a headed golden goal , allowing them to advance to the quarter - final .
South Korea faced Spain in the quarter - finals .
Spain managed to score twice in this match , but both goals were cancelled by the referee officials .
The game then went to the penalties and South Korea won the penalty shootout 5–3 , and becoming the first Asian team to reach the final four .
The South Korean team 's run was halted by a 1–0 loss to Germany in the semi - finals .
They lost to Turkey 3–2 in the third - place match to gain fourth place .
Team captain Hong Myung - bo received the Bronze Ball as the World Cup 's third best player , the first Asian footballer to be awarded this .
In addition Hong was selected for the team of tournament alongside teammate
Yoo Sang - chul , the first and only time Asian footballers have been named .
This level of success was unprecedented for a country that had never before won a game in the World Cup .
They had gone further than any Asian team and upset several established European teams in the process , leading to an increase in the popularity of football in the country .
Hiddink became a national hero in South Korea , becoming the first person to be granted honorary citizenship as well as being given a private villa .
2003–2006
Section::::2003–2006 .
Despite widespread pleas for him to stay , Hiddink resigned following the 2002 World Cup .
After his departure there was a greater emphasis on hiring foreign coaches .
As a result , Portuguese coach Humberto Coelho became the new manager .
Under his management South Korea participated in and won the first EAFF East Asian Cup in 2003 .
However , following shocking defeats to Oman and Vietnam and a hapless 0–0 draw against the Maldives , Coehlo was sacked .
Dutch coach Jo Bonfrere then took over .
They had less success the next year in the Asian Cup , losing to Iran in the quarter finals .
South Korea hosted the East Asian Cup in 2005 but finished in last place .
2006
FIFA WORLD CUP Section::::2006 FIFA World Cup . South Korea qualified for the 2006 World Cup after defeating Kuwait in the qualifiers , finishing second in Group B after Saudi Arabia .
By this point Bonfrere had come under heavy criticism for the team 's poor performance during the 2005 East Asian Cup as well as a 0–2 defeat to Saudi Arabia during World Cup qualification .
He eventually resigned , and as a result , the Korean Football Association named Dick Advocaat the new coach to lead the team into the World Cup .
During the 2006 World Cup , South Korea achieved their first World Cup victory outside Asia by beating Togo 2–1 , with goals from Lee Chun - soo and Ahn Jung - hwan .
Their next game was against France , who held the lead for most of the game but a goal by Park Ji - sung allowed the South Korean team to draw with the eventual finalists .
This placed South Korea at the top of their group but they lost their last game 2–0 to Switzerland , which eliminated them from the tournament .
Advocaat resigned after failing to reach the second round and was replaced by assistant coach Pim Verbeek , who had also worked under Hiddink during the 2002 World Cup .
2007–2010
Section::::2007–2010 .
South Korea 's next major tournament was the 2007 Asian Cup .
The team struggled in the group stages without key players Lee Young - pyo , Park Ji - sung , and Seol Ki - hyeon .
The team drew its first game 1–1 against Saudi Arabia but suffered a shocking 1–2 defeat to Bahrain .
They narrowly defeated co - host Indonesia in their final group game and managed to scrape through with four points .
They defeated Iran in the quarterfinals via penalty shootout following a 0–0 draw .
South Korea entered another penalty shootout after another goalless draw to Iraq but were defeated .
They then beat Japan on penalties once more to gain third place .
Later , it was discovered that during the tournament , four veteran players , including then captain Lee Woon - jae , broke team rules to go on a late - night drinking binge in an Indonesian bar .
Each of the four players were banned from national team participation for at least two years .
Pim Verbeek resigned after the tournament , taking blame for the team 's unsatisfactory performance as they had failed to score a single goal following the group stage and had to resort to penalties for three games in a row .
He also criticized the unrealistic expectations from the fans .
Afterwards , South Korea chose its first South Korean coach since 2000 when Huh Jung - moo , who had coached the team in 2000 , took the helm for the second time .
Under his management , the South Korean team managed to win the 2008 East Asian Cup , go undefeated for 27 consecutive games in 2009 , and qualify for the 2010 World Cup .

In the knockout stage they met Uruguay , who took an early lead with a goal from Luis Suárez .
South Korea equalized in the second half after Lee Chung - yong scored his second goal of the tournament but South Korea conceded another goal by Suárez in the 80th minute .

Following a humiliating 3–0 loss to Japan and a shocking 1–2 loss to Lebanon in Beirut , Cho was unceremoniously sacked despite an initial 6–0 victory over Lebanon on home soil .
He was hurriedly replaced with Choi Kang - hee with the task of qualifying for the 2014 World Cup as the team was in jeopardy of breaking its long - running streak of World Cup qualifications .
Under Choi South Korea narrowly qualified for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil by finishing second in their group via goal difference .
Choi 's contract was up after the conclusion of the qualification matches and was replaced by former player Hong Myung - bo , who had captained the 2002 World Cup team and coached the under-23 team to a bronze medal finish at the 2012 Olympics .
Despite high expectations under Hong , South Korea continued its run of poor form .

The team 's poor performance resulted in a hostile reaction from fans , who threw toffees at them upon their return .
Hong was heavily criticized for the perceived lack of strategy and team selection controversies .
Following the World Cup , Hong initially intended to continue in his position until the 2015 Asian Cup , but relented and resigned under heavy media pressure along with several KFA associates in responsibility for the failures at the World Cup .
The KFA reinstated Lee Yong - soo as its technical committee director , who held the same position during Hiddink 's success in 2002 .
