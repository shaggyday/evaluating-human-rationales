EARLY LIFE AND CAREER Section::::Early life and career .
Zinedine Zidane was born on 23 June 1972 in La Castellane , Marseille , in Southern France .
He is the youngest of five siblings .
Zidane is of Algerian Kabyle descent .
His parents , Smaïl and Malika , emigrated to Paris from the village of Aguemoune in the Berber - speaking region of Kabylie in northern Algeria in 1953 before the start of the Algerian War .
The family , which had settled in the city 's tough northern districts of Barbès and Saint - Denis , found little work in the region , and in the mid-1960s moved to the northern Marseille suburb of La Castellane in the 16th arrondissement of Marseille .
His father worked as a warehouseman and nightwatchman at a department store , often on the night shift , while his mother was a housewife .
The family lived a reasonably comfortable life by the standards of the neighbourhood , which was notorious throughout Marseille for its high crime and unemployment rates .
Zidane credits his strict upbringing and his father as the " guiding light " in his career .
It was in Castellane where Zidane had his earliest introduction in football , joining in at the age of five in football games that the neighbourhood 's children played on the Place Tartane , an 80-by-12-yard plaza that served as the main square of the housing complex .
In July 2011 , Zidane named former Marseille players Blaž Slišković , Enzo Francescoli and Jean - Pierre Papin as his idols while growing up .
At the age of ten , Zidane got his first player 's licence after joining the junior team of a local club from Castellane by the name of US Saint - Henri .
After spending a year and a half at US Saint - Henri , Zidane joined SO Septèmes - les - Vallons when the Septèmes coach Robert Centenero convinced the club 's Director to get Zidane .
Zidane stayed with Septèmes until the age of 14 , at which time he was selected to attend a three - day training camp at the CREPS ( Regional Centre for Sports and Physical Education ) in Aix - en - Provence , one of several such footballing institutes run by the French Football Federation .
It was here that Zidane was spotted by AS Cannes scout and former player Jean Varraud , who recommended him to the training centre director of the club .
As a 14 year old watching the 1986 World Cup , the performance of Diego Maradona left an indelible mark on him , with Zidane stating Maradona " was on another level " .
CLUB CAREER
CANNES Section::::Club career .
Section::::Cannes .
Zidane went to AS Cannes for a six - week stay , but ended up remaining at the club for four years to play at the professional level .
Having left his family to join Cannes , he was invited by Cannes Director Jean - Claude Elineau to leave the dormitory he shared with 20 other trainees and to come and stay with him and his family .
Zidane later said that while living with the Elineaus he found equilibrium .
It was at Cannes where Zidane 's first coaches noticed that he was raw and sensitive , prone to attack spectators who insulted his race or family .
His first coach , Jean Varraud , encouraged him to channel his anger and focus on his own game .
Zidane spent his first weeks at Cannes mainly on cleaning duty as a punishment for punching an opponent who mocked his ghetto origins .
The occasional violence that he would display throughout his career was shaped by an internal conflict of being an Algerian - Frenchman suspended between cultures , and surviving the tough streets of La Castellane where he grew up .
Zidane made his professional debut with Cannes on 18 May 1989 in a French Division 1 match against Nantes .
He scored his first goal for the club on 10 February 1991 also against Nantes in a 2–1 win .
After the match during a party for all the Cannes players , Zidane was given a car by Cannes Chairman Alain Pedretti , who had promised him one the day he scored his first goal for the club .
On the pitch , Zidane displayed extraordinary technique on the ball , offering glimpses of the talent that would take him to the top of the world game .
In his first full season with Cannes , the club secured its first ever European football berth by qualifying for the UEFA Cup after finishing fourth in the league .
This remains the club 's highest finish in the top flight since getting relegated for the first time from the first division in the 1948–49 season .
BORDEAUX Section::::Bordeaux .
Zidane was transferred to Girondins de Bordeaux in the 1992–93 season , winning the 1995 Intertoto Cup after beating Karlsruhe , and finishing runner - up against Bayern Munich in the 1995–96 UEFA Cup , in four years with the club .
He played a set of midfield combinations with Bixente Lizarazu and Christophe Dugarry , which would become the trademark of both Bordeaux and the 1998 French national team .
In 1995 , Blackburn Rovers manager Kenny Dalglish had expressed interest in signing both Zidane and Dugarry , to which club owner Jack Walker reportedly replied , " Why do you want to sign Zidane when we have Tim Sherwood ? "
Also towards the beginning of the 1996 season , according to football agent Barry Silkman , Zidane was offered to Newcastle United for £ 1.2 million , but the club turned down the offer after watching him , claiming that he was not good enough for the English First Division .
In 1996 , Zidane received the award for Ligue 1 Player of the Year .
JUVENTUS Section::::Juventus .
After a series of stand out performances for both Bordeaux and France , Zidane had offers to join Europe 's top clubs in the spring of 1996 , deciding on a move to UEFA Champions League winners Juventus during the close season .
Zidane 's impact in Italy was immediate , winning the 1996–97 Serie A title and the 1996 Intercontinental Cup .
He was named Serie A Foreign Footballer of the Year in his first season .
Zidane 's growing status in the sport saw him chosen in a European XI to face a World XI – featuring a forward line of Ronaldo and Gabriel Batistuta – in December 1997 .
As the playmaker at Juve , Zidane played just behind forward Alessandro Del Piero , with Del Piero recalling , " Zidane had an extraordinary talent , which contributed to his sole interest in helping the team .
He was not a selfish player .
He had a unique ability to be a great and to be a team player .
I was lucky to play with him . "
He lost in the 1997 UEFA Champions League Final 3–1 to Borussia Dortmund when he was unable to make an impression against the close marking of Paul Lambert .
The following season , Zidane scored seven goals in 32 matches in the league to help Juventus win the 1997–98 Serie A and thus retain the Scudetto .
In Europe , Juventus made their third consecutive UEFA Champions League Final appearance , but lost the game 1–0 to Real Madrid .
In 1998 , Zidane was named FIFA World Player of the Year , and won the Ballon d'Or .
Juventus finished second in the 2000–01 Serie A , but were eliminated in the group stage of the Champions League , after Zidane was banned for head - butting Hamburger SV player Jochen Kientz .
In 2001 , Zidane was named Serie A Foreign Footballer of the Year for the second time .
REAL MADRID Section::::Real Madrid .
In 2001 , Zidane joined Real Madrid for a world record fee of 150 billion Italian lire , ( about € 77.5 million by fixed exchange rate ; a reported 12.8 billion pesetas ) in installments , and signed a four - year contract .

The goal has been cited as one of the greatest in Champions League history .
The magnitude of the strike saw Zidane produce one of his most emotional goal celebrations as he ran towards the touchline with mouth wide open , screaming in delight .
The next season , Zidane helped Real Madrid to win the 2002–03 La Liga , starring alongside Luís Figo in midfield , and was named the FIFA World Player of the Year for the third time .
In 2004 , fans voted him as the best European footballer of the previous 50 years in UEFA 's fiftieth - anniversary Golden Jubilee Poll .

Zidane remained an icon to the French public , and one French writer stated , " It 's good for us to see our national hero is fallible . " It was later revealed through interviews that Marco Materazzi had insulted Zidane 's sister , which led to Zidane 's heightened anger and reaction .
In 2010 , Zidane said that he would " rather die than apologize " to Materazzi for the headbutt in the final , but also admitted that he " could never have lived with himself " had he been allowed to remain on the pitch and help France win the match .
He later said , " If you look at the fourteen red cards I had in my career , twelve of them were a result of provocation .
This is n't justification , this is n't an excuse , but my passion , temper and blood made me react . "

When Zidane stepped onto the pitch , the ten other guys just got suddenly better .
It is that simple . "
David Beckham has described Zidane as " the greatest of all time " , Barcelona star Xavi has stated in a 2010 interview that Zidane was " best player in the ' 90s and early 2000s " , while Brazilian defender and former Madrid teammate Roberto Carlos has said of Zidane , " He is the best player I 've seen .

His elegance of movement on the pitch and his skills are uncanny . "
Journalist Sid Lowe wrote , " Zidane was football 's answer to the Bolshoi Ballet .
Zidane was elegance above all else .
" Spanish midfielder Xabi Alonso opined , " What he could do with a football is a dream for most of us . "
In 2005 , upon Zidane 's return to the French national team , his teammate Thierry Henry stated , " In France , everybody realized that God exists , and that he is back in the French international team . "
Zidane has been lauded by sportsmen outside football ; having witnessed Zidane 's goal against Deportivo La Coruña in January 2002 , where he dragged the ball right then left , turning the defender inside out , before scoring with a left foot finish , basketball player Magic Johnson stated , " One of the most inspiring nights of my life .
Zidane is a phenomenon . "
Zidane has been named FIFA World Player of the Year three times , a feat achieved only by Ronaldo , Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo .
In 2002 , ESPN described Zidane as " the greatest player in the world in the world 's biggest game " .

RECEPTION AS MANAGER Section::::Reception as manager .
Despite establishing himself as one of the most successful managers of his era and in the history of Real Madrid , Zidane 's time at Real Madrid was considered by some to be shadowed by a partial amount of luck .
However , Zidane 's tactical philosophy , particularly his tactical flexibility , has been praised by many .
His use of in - game substitutions was particularly praised , as many of his substitutes led to victories , such as introducing Marco Asensio and Lucas Vázquez in order to provide pace and width against Paris Saint - Germain in the UEFA Champions League to overturn a 1–0 deficit into a 3–1 victory .
His introduction of Gareth Bale for similar reasons in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final also reaped similar rewards .
It is also noted that his team focused on attacking through the flanks , while he is credited for popularizing the 4–4–2 diamond formation in contemporary football .
On the other hand , some consider that Zidane 's role was more focused in grinding out results and uniting the dressing room , rather than having a fixed tactic scheme .
Zidane emphasized the importance of players ' physical levels and preferred to choose impactful players over a defined system .
