HARVARD DIVINITY
SCHOOL Harvard Divinity School is one of the constituent schools of Harvard University , located in Cambridge , Massachusetts , United States .
, the school 's mission is to train and educate its students either in the academic study of religion , or for the practice of a religious ministry or other public service vocation .
It also caters to students from other Harvard schools that are interested in the former field .
Harvard Divinity School is among a small group of university - based , non - denominational divinity schools in the United States ( the others include the University of Chicago Divinity School , Yale Divinity School , Vanderbilt University Divinity School and Wake Forest University School of Divinity ) .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Harvard College was founded in 1636 as a Puritan / Congregationalist institution and trained ministers for many years .
The separate institution of the Divinity School , however , dates from 1816 , when it was established as the first non - denominational divinity school in the United States .
( Princeton Theological Seminary had been founded as a Presbyterian institution in 1812 .
Andover Theological Seminary was founded in 1807 by orthodox Calvinists who fled Harvard College after it appointed liberal theologian Henry Ware to the Hollis Professorship of Divinity in 1805 . )
During its first century , Harvard Divinity School was unofficially associated with American Unitarianism .
However , it also retains a historical tie to one of the successor denominations of American Congregationalism , the United Church of Christ .
HARVARD DIVINITY SCHOOL AND UNITARIANISM Section::::Harvard Divinity School and Unitarianism .
Throughout the 18th century , Enlightenment ideas of the power of reason and free will became widespread among Congregationalist ministers , putting those ministers and their congregations in tension with more traditionalist , Calvinist parties .
When the Hollis Professor of Divinity David Tappan died in 1803 and the president of Harvard Joseph Willard died a year later , in 1804 , the overseer of the college Jedidiah Morse demanded that orthodox men be elected .
Nevertheless , after much struggle , the Unitarian Henry Ware was elected in 1805 , which signaled the changing of the tide from the dominance of traditional , Calvinist ideas at Harvard to the dominance of liberal , Arminian ideas ( defined by traditionalists as Unitarian ideas ) .
The appointment of Ware , with the election of the liberal Samuel Webber to the presidency of Harvard two years later , led Jedidiah Morse and other conservatives to found the Andover Theological Seminary as an orthodox alternative to the Harvard Divinity School .
TODAY Section::::Today .
Today , students and faculty come from a variety of religious backgrounds :
Christian ( all denominations ) , Jewish , Muslim , Hindu , Buddhist , Sikh , etc .
Its academic programs attempt to balance theology and religious studies — that is , the " believer 's " perspective on religion with the " secular " perspective on religion .
This is in contrast to many other divinity schools where one or the other is given primacy ( Yale Divinity School , for example , emphasizes its theological program , while the majority of students at the University of Chicago Divinity School enroll in its " religious studies " Master of Arts program ) .
DEGREES Section::::Degrees .
Harvard Divinity School is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada ( ATS ) and approved by ATS to grant the following degrees :
* Master of Theological Studies ( MTS ) * Master of Divinity ( MDiv )
* Master of Theology ( ThM )
* Doctor of Theology ( ThD ) ( see below )
In addition to candidates for the above , many Harvard graduate students pursuing PhDs in the study of religion work closely with Divinity School faculty .
These students are formally affiliated with the Committee on the Study of Religion which is made up of 50 % Arts and Sciences and 50 % Divinity faculty members and housed in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences .
In April 2014 , the Faculty of HDS voted to unify the ThD and PhD in the study of religion in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences ( GSAS ) , suspending admission to the ThD starting in fall 2015 .
Those previously admitted to the ThD program continue to be candidates for the ThD , with the first cohort of PhD candidates entering in fall 2015 .
While many PhD students in the GSAS take courses at HDS , and admissions material from HDS advertises the PhD in the study of religion , PhD students are formally enrolled in the GSAS and not at HDS ; only the GSAS at Harvard may award the PhD. CURRICULUM Section::::Curriculum .

Since its founding , it has supported more than 100 scholars , representing over 50 institutions of higher learning in the United States and around the world .
The WSRP promotes critical inquiry into the interaction between religion and gender , and every year the program brings five postdoctoral scholars to HDS .
The research associates each work on a book - length research project and teach courses related to their research .
CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF WORLD RELIGIONS Section::::Center for the Study of World Religions .
Founded in 1960 after an anonymous donation in 1957 , the Center for the Study of World Religions at Harvard Divinity School is a residential community of academic fellows , graduate students , and visiting professors of many world religious traditions .

It welcomes scholars and practitioners , and highlights the intellectual and historical dimensions of religious dialogue .
, its current director is Charles Stang , a scholar of ancient Christianity , focusing especially on Eastern varieties of late antique Christianity .
The Center sponsors a diverse range of educative programs , ranging from public lectures to colloquia and reading groups , student - initiated projects , and " religion in the news " lunches on topics of public interest .
The Center 's Meditation Room is used regularly by individuals and groups .
The building that houses the Center was designed by Josep Lluís Sert .
SUMMER LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE Section::::Summer Leadership Institute .
The Summer Leadership Institute ( SLI ) , which has been discontinued , was a two - week training program that sought to establish theological instruction and grounding for individuals engaged in community and economic development .
The program of study was divided into four modules : Theology , Ethics , and Public Policy ; Organizational Development and Management ; Housing and Community Development ; and Finance and Economic Development .
As a full - time residential program , holding classes five days a week , the educational focus lies on faith - based case studies of corporations and communities .
Since the SLI 's inauguration in 1998 , more than 450 participants have completed the program .
About 50 people were selected each year from around the United States and internationally to participate in lectures , seminars , and field visits with faculty from across Harvard and other recognized experts .
Participants also developed individual plans of action , on a case - study model , applicable to the local work in their communities .
PROGRAM IN RELIGION AND SECONDARY
EDUCATION Section::::Program in Religion and Secondary Education .
The Program in Religion and Secondary Education is a teacher education program that prepares students to teach about religion in public schools from a non - sectarian perspective .
Students in the master of theological studies or master of divinity degree programs integrate their work in religion with courses on education and public policy to understand the relationship between religion and education and to advance religious literacy within their fields of licensure .
Harvard Divinity School 's Program in Religious Studies and Education ( PRSE ) has been temporarily suspended , pending new permanent funding that will allow the program to continue and to be capable of serving more students than can currently be admitted into the program .
Beginning with the 2009 - 10 academic year , no new students will be admitted to the program for at least the next two years .
Students who are already in the PRSE will continue and be able to finish their degree in normal fashion .
