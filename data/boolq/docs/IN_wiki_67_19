PLOT Section::::Plot .
In 1127 A.D. , several English crusader knights bury an Egyptian ruby within the tomb of one of their members .
In present - day London , a construction crew discovers the tomb and a mysterious man is authorized to investigate the site .
In a flashback to the New Kingdom era , Princess Ahmanet is first in line to succeed her father Menehptre until his second wife gives birth to a son .
Determined to claim the throne for herself , Ahmanet summons Set , who agrees to help her if she uses a mystical dagger known as the Dagger of Set to transfer his spirit into a physical form .
After murdering her father , his wife , and their child , Ahmanet attempts to sacrifice her lover to Set but is captured by her father 's priests and condemned to be mummified alive for eternity .
Her sarcophagus is then buried in Mesopotamia and submerged in a pool of mercury to ensure that her monstrous form never escapes .
In present - day Iraq , Sergeant Nick Morton and Corporal Chris Vail , while on Long Range Reconnaissance for the U.S. Army , discover the tomb of Ahmanet after calling in an airstrike on an insurgent stronghold .
Jenny Halsey , an archaeologist who had a one - night stand with Nick and had her map stolen by him , arrives and investigates the tomb , correctly concluding that it is a prison .
After Nick extracts Ahmanet 's sarcophagus from the pool of mercury , Nick 's superior , Colonel Greenway , places it on a transport plane headed to England .
During the flight , Vail becomes possessed by Ahmanet 's power after being bitten by a camel spider while inside the tomb .
After attempting to open the sarcophagus , he stabs Greenway and tries to attack the group , forcing Nick to kill him .
A huge number of crows then assault the plane , causing it to crash and kill everyone on board except for Jenny , who is parachuted off the plane by Nick .
Nick awakens a day later in a morgue , in Oxford , discovering that he has been brought back to life by unknown means and learns from Vail 's sardonic ghost that he has been cursed by Ahmanet , who seeks to use him as a replacement vessel for Set .
Ahmanet 's mummy escapes from the sarcophagus and begins feeding on rescue workers to regenerate her decomposed body .
Turning the workers into zombie minions , she lures Nick and Jenny into a trap , forcing the two to fight off her minions as they unsuccessfully try to escape .
Ahmanet also recovers the Dagger of Set from a reliquary in a nearby church .
At the last moment , however , unknown soldiers appear and subdue Ahmanet .
Their leader , Dr. Henry Jekyll , explains that Jenny is an agent of Prodigium , a secret society dedicated to hunting supernatural threats .
He reveals much of his own history and confirms that Nick was cursed when Ahmanet 's tomb was opened .
Although first welcoming Dr. Jekyll 's help , Nick ( as well as Jenny ) becomes horrified to discover the doctor 's intention to complete the ritual , allowing Set to possess Nick completely , in the belief that this will render Set vulnerable and allow his evil to be ended forever .
Meanwhile , Ahmanet summons a spider to possess a Prodigium technician and frees herself from captivity , wreaking havoc , death , and destruction in the process .
After verbally sparring with Nick , Jekyll succumbs to his own dark impulses and transforms into Edward Hyde , his sadistic and murderous alternate personality , even as Ahmanet wreaks havoc outside , unbeknownst to them .
Nick rebuffs the repulsive Hyde 's offer of an alliance between them , and Hyde attacks him .
However , Nick manages to stop him with the serum Jekyll uses to suppress his evil side .
He and Jenny then escape from Prodigium , but they run into Ahmanet once again .
She steals back the dagger , summons an army of deceased crusaders to serve her , and creates a massive sandstorm that ravages London , with Nick and Jenny narrowly escaping her grasp .
The undead knights slaughter the Prodigium soldiers in the tomb ( discovered during the film 's opening ) and Ahmanet finally recovers the ruby and places it in the dagger 's pommel , granting her all that she needs to free Set aside from Nick himself .
Guided by the spectral Vail , Nick and Jenny flee into the London Underground tunnels , but it is revealed that Vail is still under Ahmanet 's control and they are soon attacked by Ahmanet 's minions .
Ahmanet captures Jenny and drowns her , hoping to break her hold over Nick .
Nick is beaten up by Ahmanet until he gives up and lets Ahmanet embrace him , using it as a ruse to steal the dagger and shatter the ruby .
However , he sees the lifeless Jenny and bets on stabbing himself .
Nick 's body is partially possessed by Set , who proceeds to join Ahmanet to uphold his end of the bargain .
However , looking back at Jenny 's dead body , Nick regains control , using Set 's powers to overpower and suck the life out of Ahmanet .
Once Ahmanet is transformed back into a shriveled mummy , Nick harnesses Set 's powers to resurrect Jenny , saying goodbye before succumbing to Set 's nature and disappearing .
Soon , Jenny regroups with Dr. Jekyll , and they tensely discuss if Nick , now fused with Set in an uncertain way , will use his powers for good , evil , or something else entirely .
Ahmanet 's corpse is lowered into a locked pool of mercury within the Prodigium base for safekeeping .
Meanwhile , in the desert , Nick resurrects Vail , and the two set out on a new adventure .

CRITICAL RESPONSE
Section::::Critical response .
The Mummy received generally negative reviews from critics , with criticism aimed at its narrative , tone , acting , and plot points setting up the Dark Universe .
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 15 % based on 273 reviews , with an average rating of 4.2/10 .
The site 's critical consensus reads , " Lacking the campy fun of the franchise 's most recent entries and failing to deliver many monster - movie thrills , The Mummy suggests a speedy unraveling for the Dark Universe .
"
On Metacritic , the film has a weighted average score of 34 out of 100 , based on 44 critics , indicating " generally unfavorable reviews " .
Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of " B‚àí " on an A+ to F scale , while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 70 % overall positive score .
Vince Mancini of Uproxx gave the film a negative review , writing : " If you like incomprehensible collections of things that vaguely resemble other things you might 've enjoyed in the past , The Mummy is the movie for you . "
IndieWire 's David Ehrlich gave the film a D- , calling it the worst film of Cruise 's career and criticizing its lack of originality , saying : " It 's one thing to excavate the iconography of old Hollywood , it 's another to exploit it .
This is n't filmmaking , it 's tomb - raiding . "
Owen Gleiberman of Variety wrote : " The problem at its heart is that the reality of what the movie is ‚Äî a Tom Cruise vehicle ‚Äî is at war with the material .
The actor , at 54 , is still playing that old Cruise trope , the selfish cocky semi - scoundrel who has to grow up . ...
The trouble is that Cruise , at least in a high - powered potboiler like this one , is so devoted to maintaining his image as a clear and wholesome hero that his flirtation with the dark side is almost entirely theoretical . "
Writing for Rolling Stone , Peter Travers gave the film one star out of four , saying : " How meh is The Mummy ?
Let me count the ways .
For all the huffing and puffing and digital desperation from overworked computers , this reboot lands onscreen with a resounding thud . "
Glen Kenny of RogerEbert.com gave the film 1.5/4 stars , writing : I found something almost admirable about the film 's cheek .
It 's amazingly relentless in its naked borrowing from other , better horror and sci - fi movies that I was able to keep occupied making a checklist of the movies referenced .
Entertainment Weeklys Chis Nashawaty wrote that the film " feels derivative and unnecessary and like it was written by committee .
"
In BBC World News Culture , Nicholas Barber calls the film " a mish - mash of wildly varying tones and plot strands , from its convoluted beginning to its shameless non - end .
Tom Cruise 's new film barely qualifies as a film at all .
None of it makes sense .
The film delivers all the chases , explosions , zombies and ghosts you could ask for , and there are a few amusing lines and creepy moments , but , between the headache - inducing flashbacks and hallucinations , the narrative would be easier to follow if it were written in hieroglyphics . "
Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote that the film " has some nice moments but is basically a mess .
The plot sags like an aeon - old decaying limb , a jumble of ideas and scenes from what look like different screenplay drafts .
"
Empire film magazine was more positive , with Dan Jolin awarding the film three stars .
" It 's running and jumping grin - flashing business as usual for Cruise , once more on safe character territory as an Ethan Hunt - esque action protagonist who couples up with a much younger woman , while another woman chases after him , " he wrote .
"
And if the next installment - teasing conclusion is anything to go by , Cruise seemed to have enough fun making this that he may just return for more . "
