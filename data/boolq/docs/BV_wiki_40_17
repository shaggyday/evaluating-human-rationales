AGE OF CANDIDACY Age of candidacy is the minimum age at which a person can legally qualify to hold certain elected government offices .
In many cases , it also determines the age at which a person may be eligible to stand for an election or be granted ballot access .
The first known example of a law enforcing age of candidacy was the Lex Villia Annalis , a Roman law enacted in 180 BCE which set the minimum ages for senatorial magistrates .
CONTROVERSIES Section::::Controversies .
Many youth rights groups view current age of candidacy requirements as unjustified age discrimination .
Occasionally people who are younger than the minimum age will run for an office in protest of the requirement or because they do n't know that the requirement exists .
On extremely rare occasions , young people have been elected to offices they do not qualify for and have been deemed ineligible to assume the office .
In 1934 , Rush Holt of West Virginia was elected to the Senate of the United States at the age of 29 .
Since the U.S. Constitution requires senators to be at least 30 , Holt was forced to wait until his 30th birthday , six months after the start of the session , before being sworn in .
In 1954 , Richard Fulton won election to the Tennessee Senate .
Shortly after being sworn in , Fulton was ousted from office because he was only 27 years old at the time .
The Tennessee State Constitution required that senators be at least 30 .
Rather than hold a new election , the previous incumbent , Clifford Allen , was allowed to resume his office for another term .
Fulton went on to win the next State Senate election in 1956 and was later elected to the US House of Representatives where he served for 10 years .
In South Carolina , two Senators aged 24 were elected , but were too young according to the State Constitution :
Mike Laughlin in 1969 and Bryan Dorn ( later a US Congressman ) in 1941 .
They were seated anyway .
On several occasions , the Socialist Workers Party ( USA ) has nominated candidates too young to qualify for the offices they were running for .
In 1972 , Linda Jenness ran as the SWP presidential candidate , although she was only 31 at the time .
Since the U.S. Constitution requires that the President and Vice President be at least 35 years old , Jenness was not able to receive ballot access in several states in which she otherwise qualified .
Despite this handicap , Jenness still received 83,380 votes .
In 2004 , the SWP nominated Arrin Hawkins as the party 's vice - presidential candidate , although she was only 28 at the time .
Hawkins was also unable to receive ballot access in several states due to her age .
REFORM EFFORTS
Section::::Reform efforts .
In the United States , many groups have attempted to lower age of candidacy requirements in various states .
In 1994 , South Dakota voters rejected a ballot measure that would have lowered the age requirements to serve as a State Senator or State Representative from 30 to 18 .
In 1998 , however , they approved a similar ballot measure that reduced the age requirements for those offices from 25 to 21 .
In 2002 , Oregon voters rejected a ballot measure that would have reduced the age requirement to serve as a State Representative from 21 to 18 .
During the early 2000s , the British Youth Council and other groups successfully campaigned to lower age of candidacy requirements in the United Kingdom .
