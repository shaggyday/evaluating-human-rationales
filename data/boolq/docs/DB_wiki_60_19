PHASE 10 Phase 10 is a card game created in 1982 by Kenneth Johnson and sold by Mattel , which purchased the rights from Fundex Games in 2010 .
Phase 10 is based on a variant of rummy known as Liverpool rummy , and is a member of the contract rummy family .
It requires a special deck or two regular decks of cards ; it can be played by two to six people .
The game is named after ten phases ( or melds ) that a player must advance through in order to win .
Phase 10 was Fundex 's best selling product , selling over 32,600,000 units to date , making it the 2nd best - selling commercial card game behind Mattel 's Uno .
In December 2010 , Fundex sold the rights to Phase 10 to Mattel , and now develops and markets a line of games based on brands and other IP formerly exclusive to Mattel as well as Fundex 's own brands .
There is a new version called " Phase 10 Mod " that comes in a yellow and white case or a newer case that is blue , a green and yellow stripe and bits of red on the front and back If the player lays down their phase and are out of cards and a player has a phase after them , they can still lay that hand down .
The person at the end of the game with the least points wins .
OBJECTIVE
Section::::Objective .
The object of the game is to be the first person to complete all ten phases .
In the case of two players completing the last phase in the same hand , the player who completed the last phase with the lowest overall score is the winner .
If those scores also happen to be tied , a tiebreaker round is played where the tying players attempt to complete phase ten ( or in variants , the last phase each player had tried to complete in the previous round ) .
For each hand , each player 's object is to complete and lay down the current phase , and then rid their hand of remaining cards by discarding them on laid - down Phases , called " hitting " .
The player who does this first wins the hand and scores no penalty ; all other players earn penalty points according to the value of cards remaining in their hand .
There are one hundred and eight cards in a deck :
* ninety - six numbered cards : two of each value from one through twelve , in each of four colors .
Therefore , there are 24 cards of each color and eight of each value .
* eight Wild cards ; * four Skip cards ; With two regular decks of cards
, the suits can represent the four different colors , kings can represent the wild cards , and jokers can represent the skip cards .
SPECIAL CARDS
* Wild : A " Wild " card may be used in place of a number card and can be used as any color to complete any phase .
Original print runs of Phase 10 had two Wilds in each color ; to reduce confusion , current print runs use black Wilds .
* More than one " Wild " card may be used in completing a Phase .
Players can use as many " Wild " cards as they want as long as they use one natural card .
* Once a " Wild " card has been played in a Phase , it can not be replaced by the intended card and used elsewhere .
It must remain as that card until the hand is over .
*
If the dealer starts the discard pile with a " Wild " card , the card may be picked up by the first player .
* A " Wild " card may not be used as a " skip " card .
* Skip :
Skip cards have only one purpose : to cause another player to lose a turn .
To use , a player discards the " Skip " card on their turn and chooses the player who will lose a turn .
* When a " Skip " card is drawn it may be discarded immediately or saved for a later turn .
* A " Skip " card may never be picked up from the discard pile .
* A " Skip " card can not be used to complete any phase , including Phase 8 ( seven cards of one color ) .
The original print runs of Phase 10 had blue Skip cards , causing confusion with normal blue cards in deck ; Skip cards are now black in current editions .
* Any player can be skipped , not just the person who would normally play next .
* A player can not be skipped twice in the same round ; they must lose turn in the round before being skipped again .
( They can be skipped twice in a row but not until they miss their turn . )
* If the first card that starts the discard pile is a " skip " card then the first players first turn is skipped .
PHASES Section::::Phases .
A phase is a combination of cards .
Phases are usually composed of sets ( multiple cards of the same value ) , runs ( multiple cards in consecutive ascending order ) , cards of one color , or a combination of these .
As the name suggests , there are ten phases :
Also if you get 30 or 31 cards you skip a phase .
Original and Master 's Edition Phases :
* Phase 1 : 2 sets of 3 * Phase 2
: 1 set of 3 + 1 run of 4 * Phase 3
: 1 set of 4 + 1 run of 4 * Phase 4 : 1 run of 7
* Phase 5 : 1 run of 8
* Phase 6
: 1 run of 9 * Phase 7
: 2 sets of 4 * Phase 8 : 7 cards of one color
* Phase 9 : 1 set of 5 + 1 set of 2 * Phase 10
: 1 set of 5 + 1 set of 3 Phase 10 Twist Phases :
* Phase 1 : 3 sets of 3 * Phase 2 : 4 sets of 2 * Phase 3
: 1 set of 5 + 1 run of 4 * Phase 4 : 2 sets of 3 + 1 run of 3 * Phase 5
: 1 set of 3 + 1 run of 6 * Phase 6
: 2 runs of 4 * Phase 7
: 1 run of 4 + 4 cards of one color * Phase 8 : 1 run of 5 of one color * Phase 9 : 8 cards of one color * Phase 10 : 9 cards of one color Each player can make only one phase per hand .
For instance , a run of nine cards when the player is on Phase 4 can not also count as Phase 5 and/or 6 .
In the original and Phase 10 Twist versions , the phases must also be completed in order , but the Master 's Edition variant has a rule allowing players to choose the phase they will attempt to complete after being dealt their hand and before play begins .
DEFINITIONS
* Set : A set is made of two or more cards with the same number and any color .
* Run : A run ( similar to a straight ) is made of two or more cards numbered in order , in any color .
( though in older versions all numbers must be of the same color . )
Runs can go from one to twelve .
( Do not mix the two separate decks )
* Color " : Phase 8 of the original and Master 's Edition , and several phases of Phase 10 Twist , require the player to collect cards that are all the same color ( or suit , if using ordinary playing cards ) .
This is the ONLY time the colors of the cards are relevant in the game ; runs do not have to be all one color ( as in many standard - deck Rummy variants ) .
Wilds , despite having a printed color in certain editions , can be used to represent any color , and Skips , despite being blue in certain editions , can not be used to complete this ( or any ) Phase .
* Even or Odd : An even or odd is made of two or more cards that are either even ( 2,4,6,8,10,12 ) , or odd ( 1,3,5,7,9,11 ) .
PLAY Section::::Play .
One player is chosen to be the dealer ( alternately , the deal can rotate to the left after each hand ) .
The dealer shuffles the deck and deals 10 cards , face down , one at a time , to each player .
Players hold their 10 cards in hand so that the other players can not see them .
The remaining deck is placed face - down in the center of the play area to become the draw pile .
A wild card turned up goes to the next player .
The dealer then turns the top card of the draw pile over and places it next to the draw pile , to become the discard pile .
During the first hand , all players try to complete Phase 1 .
Play consists of ;
* 1 .
Drawing a card from either the draw pile or the discard pile * 2 .
Laying down their completed current phase ( if possible )
* 3 .
Hitting on other players phases once they have laid down their own phase .
* 4 .
Placing one card on the discard pile .
COMPLETING PHASES
Section::::Completing phases .
If , during a player 's turn , they are able to make their current Phase with the cards in their hand , they lay the Phase down , face - up on the table before discarding .
* Phases must be made in order , from 1 to 10 .
* A player must have the whole Phase in hand before laying it down .
* A player may lay down more than the minimum requirements of a Phase , but only if the additional cards can be directly added to the cards already in the Phase .
For instance , if a Phase requires a set of 3 but the player has four of that card , the player may lay down all four cards when completing the Phase .
* Only one Phase may be made per hand .
For instance , a player who must make a run of 7 cards ( Phase 4 ) can not complete the next two Phases in the same hand by laying down a run of 9 .
*
If a player successfully makes a Phase , then they try to make the next Phase in the next hand .
If they fail to make a Phase , they must try to make the same Phase again in the next hand .
As a result , players may not all be working on the same Phase in the same hand .
* Players receive credit for making a Phase as soon as it is laid down .
A player does not need to win the hand in order to receive credit for the Phase .
Several players will often complete their Phase in the same hand .
HITTING
Section::::Hitting .
Hitting is the way to get rid of leftover cards after making a Phase .
A hit is made by putting a card directly on a Phase already laid down .
The cards must properly fit with the cards already down .
Before a player can make a hit , their own Phase must already be laid down .
A player may only hit during their turn .
A player may hit any combination of their own Phase and other player 's Phases , and may hit with as many cards as can be played from the player 's hand on a single turn .
Players are not allowed to replace a wild card in a Phase with the card from their hand matching the card the Wild stands for .
Replacing Wild Cards is possible Variant Rule .
GOING
OUT
/ FINISHING
A HAND
Section::::Going out / finishing a hand .
After laying down a Phase , players try to " go out " as soon as possible .
To go out , a player must get rid of all of their cards by hitting and discarding .
The player to go out first wins the hand .
The winner of the hand , and any other players who also complete their Phase , will advance to the next Phase for the next hand , while any player not able to complete their Phase remain stuck on that Phase .
Players count up the total value of cards left in their hands ( the fewer cards left in their hand , the better ) and score them as follows ; * five points for each card with value 1 - 9 * ten points for each card with value 10 - 12 * fifteen points for a Skip * twenty - five points for a Wild Each player 's score for the hand is added to that player 's running total ( players who did not complete their Phase can not have a score of less than 50 for the hand and often have far more with the inclusion of extra points for large values and wilds ; this is known as being " set " similar to Hearts or Spades ) , the deal rotates to the left , all the cards are shuffled and a new hand begins .
Again , if a player did not complete their Phase before another player went out , they must work on the same Phase again in the next hand .
WINNING
Section::::Winning .
The first player that has completed Phase 10 at the end of a hand wins the game , regardless of whether they also discarded all their cards .
If two or more players complete Phase 10 in the same hand , then the player who has the lowest total points is the winner .
In the event of a tie , the players that tied replay Phase number 10 and the first player to complete their phase and discard all their cards wins . VARIATIONS OFFICIAL VARIATION PHASE SETS Section::::Variations .

Section::::Floating Variation .
A variation of play is to allow Floating .
Instead of going out by discarding their last card , a player draws a card and then play all cards in their hand without discarding .
This is known as going out " floating " .
Because the player must be able to discard a card in order to actually end the hand , other players now have at least one extra turn in which to go out themselves or at least improve their score .
In addition , a " floating " player must draw a card and play it if able , and must draw the top card from the discard pile if it can be played ; thus the floating player can be forced to play on their next turn instead of drawing and discarding .
The floating player can also be skipped as normal .
If someone else goes out before the " floater " , the floater receives a zero score , but does not technically win the hand .
The strategic value of floating is that the person immediately preceding the floating player is generally forced to try to " keep them afloat " for at least a few turns , either by discarding cards the floating player is required to pick up and play , or by skipping the floater .
This generally puts the player preceding the floater at a disadvantage compared to the other players and makes it less likely that that player will be able to finish their Phase if they have not yet done so .
Players can use this strategy to " gang up " on one player ; the player after them will float , forcing the player to try to keep them afloat while all other players get a number of extra turns to try to lay down their Phase or go out .
Of course , the player preceding the floater is not actually forced to keep them afloat and may be able to go out themselves , lay down their Phase ( thus drastically reducing their score for the hand ) , or may simply concede the hand by allowing the floater to draw ( the card drawn is likely to be an unplayable , thus discardable , card ) .
If a player is floating , and there is no possible card that could be discarded or drawn to prevent that player from being able to discard , they are known as " floating dead " ; it is extremely likely the floating player will be forced to end the hand on their next turn .
This is rare , and usually happens when the floating player completes a phase involving a long run of cards , no - one else has completed their Phase , and the floater 's run has expanded through all 12 values .
If no - one else can lay down a hittable Phase in that turn , only another player playing a Skip or the floater drawing a Skip will keep the hand going , and only four exist in the deck .
ALTERNATE WILD CARD DEAL
UP
METHOD Section::::Alternate Wild Card Deal Up Method .
If the dealer turns over a wild card at the beginning of the hand to start the discard pile , the dealer gets to decide who gets the wild card , instead of
it automatically going to the player to the left of the dealer .
The recipient of the wild card will choose a card from their hand to discard ( the card can not be a Skip ) , and then play continues with the player to the left of the dealer ( or if that player had received the wild card , with the next player to the left after them ) .
This slightly reduces the luck component inherent in the game , increasing the strategic and/or social element .
A similar rule can be used in the case of a Skip card being turned over as the first card .
MASTERS EDITION Section::::Masters Edition .
The Masters Edition of the game can be played by two to four players and includes additional rules :
* The ability to choose which Phase to attempt ( not necessarily in numerical order ) based on the cards dealt to the player .
Players must verbally declare which Phase they are attempting during the hand after cards are dealt .
*
The ability to set aside ( or save ) one card per hand .
( note : you may not save your " Going Out " discard )
* The ability to draw one card from their save pile per turn .
The Masters Edition comes with 10 Phase cards for each player to keep track of the Phases which they have completed during gameplay .
The Masters Edition also includes only two Skip cards instead of the four that the original edition contains .
This makes the playable number of cards 106 , plus the forty phase cards , for a total of 146 cards in the box .
MASTERS EDITION VARIANT
# 1 Section::::Masters Edition Variant
# 1 .
Same rules as Masters Edition except the player declares what phase they are completing as they lay down the phase .
MASTERS EDITION VARIANT
# 2 Section::::Masters Edition Variant # 2 .
Same rules as Masters Edition except ; *
The player declares what phase they are completing as they lay down the phase .
* After the player lays down the phase and hits on the other players , then they can(if they wish ) discard their current laid down phase , perform the normal discard or save and bring their hand back up to ten by drawing from the draw pile and on next turn
can work on a new phase .
( has to be done on the same turn as phase lay down and can not be done if the player discards their last card ) ANTI - PHASE Section::::Anti - phase .
In Anti - phase , you have to complete your phase in order to stay on your present phase , if you do n't complete your phase you move down a phase .
ANTI - PHASE
FOR OTHERS Section::::Anti - phase for others .
In Anti - phase for others , a rule card is left in the deck and it is discarded as your last card .
Then you get to name who moves down a phase ... if it 's stuck in your hand at the end of the hand you move down a phase .
It also may be discarded face down but may be picked up by the next player who can draw from the deck .
PHASE 10
DICE Section::::Phase 10 Dice .
Phase 10 Dice is dice game inspired by Phase 10 and also published by Fundex Games .
The goal is the same , to try to complete the phases , 1 - 10 , in order .
Instead of cards , players each take turns rolling 10 six - sided dice , 6 marked with 5 - 10 and the other four with 1 - 4 and two wilds each .
In each turn the player rolls all 10 dice , then may set aside any of them and re - roll the rest up to two times , for a total of three rolls .
If they 've completed a phase , the total sum of the dice used in the phase are added to their score and next turn they move on to a new phase .
Like in the card game , failing to complete a set means having to try for it again next turn , and the game ends once a player finishes phase 10 .
PHASE
10 TWIST
Section::::Phase
10 Twist .
The object of Phase 10 Twist is to be the first player to complete phase 10 by moving around the game board .
Every player starts with their pawn on phase 1 on the game board .
They must complete phase 1 in order to move their pawn .
There are three pawn movements ; move 3 spaces if you complete the phase and discard all of your cards , move 2 spaces if you complete the phase but do not discard all of your cards , or move 1 space if you do n't complete the phase .
If you land on a twist phase you can decide to play a twist phase or one of the phases on either side of the twist phase space .
If you play a twist phase the pawn movements change to 6 spaces if you complete the phase and discard all of your cards , 4 if you complete the phase but do not discard all of your cards , or move back one space if you do not complete the phase .
ARKANSAS RULES Section::::Arkansas Rules .
Arkansas Rules differs from standard Phase 10 rules in two ways : 1 )
Each player can complete all ten phases in any order
he /
she sees fit , and 2 ) SKIP cards are valid throughout a round
( i.e. whenever a SKIP card is played , the appropriate player is skipped whether he / she has been skipped before or not ) .
Arkansas Rules allows players to capitalize on the hand that is dealt if it contains most of the cards needed for an uncompleted phase .
The rule regarding completing phases in any order is similar to the commercialized " Masters Edition " of the game .
In order to win , a player must complete all ten phases .
Scoring is the same as standard rules Phase 10 .
POSTAL RULES Section::::Postal Rules .
Postal Rules follow the standard Phase 10 rules with two additions : 1 )
No player can go out ( play all 10 cards ) , thus ending the hand , until play has completed one circuit of the table and play has returned to the dealer .
The dealer is the first player who can end the hand by playing all 10 of their cards .
2 ) Players working to complete any of the first seven phases can use the number card that matches the phase they are working to complete as a wild card .
For example , ones are wild for all players during the first hand .
During the second hand twos are wild for those players who completed phase one in the previous hand , while ones remain wild for any player not completing phase one .
This adds the challenge of remembering the wild card of the person on your left so as to not discard cards that , for them are wild , but for you are not .
This variation is called Postal Rules in honor of the group of postal employees who have played Phase 10 everyday during lunch since 1996 .
MOBILE
Section::::Mobile .
In 2007 Fundex and Magmic signed a deal that brought Phase 10 to BlackBerry devices .
In 2009 Magmic released the title for iOS , with a Masters Edition in - app purchase available for download in February 2012 .
