F-4 Phantom II non - U.S. operators are the non - U.S. nations with air forces that operate or used to operate the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II .
The Phantom II entered service with the U.S. military in 1960 and served until 1996 .
During this time it was the primary interceptor , air superiority fighter and fighter bomber with the U.S. Navy , Marines and Air Force .
The Phantom II was exported to 11 other nations , and continues to serve in a military role in some parts of the world .
AUSTRALIA Section::::Australia .
In March 1963 , McDonnell Douglas offered to provide the RAAF with a modified version of the F-4C , the model 98DX , fitted with SNECMA Atar 9 engines .
This engine was already used in the RAAF 's Mirage IIIOs , but the French turbojet was inferior to the General Electric J79 , and the RAAF chose instead to order the F-111C Aardvark which had a greater range .
Since the development of the F-111 was plagued with many setbacks , it was expected that the order for the RAAF would not be ready before 1974 , leaving the Australian air force short of a suitable aircraft .
The need to replace their Canberra B.20s was frustrated by the delay in the development of the F-111 .
The solution was to loan F-4Es to the RAAF , under the Peace Reef program .
On 22 June 1970 , the contract was signed , and the first of 24 new F-4Es arrived the following September .
They served with Nos . 1 and 6 Squadrons , both based at RAAF Base Amberley .
The Australian aircrews praised the choice and the F-4Es were so well received that their popularity threatened the F-111C order at one point .
The first six aircraft were returned in October 1972 , with another five returned in November 1972 .
The first six F-111Cs were delivered in June 1973 , and the rest of the F-4Es were returned to the United States Air Force .
In 1972 the United States offered to sell the leased aircraft to Australia .
Earlier , the Americans had offered to sell 48 aircraft , including RF-4Es if the RAAF had cancelled the F-111C.
On balance , the F-4 would need to be supported by eight Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers to achieve the endurance required in Australian service with in - flight refueling , making the whole package uneconomical compared to the F-111C with its greater range .
Also , acquisition of the Phantom would have required disbanding at least one Mirage squadron in order to provide the necessary aircrew ( No . 82 Wing 's aircrew were to be converted to the F-111 ) .
The F-111C program was resumed in December 1971 .
One Phantom ( 69 - 7203 ) was lost in an accident during Australian service , off Evans Head , New South Wales during night bombing practice on 16 June 1971 , while the others went on to follow a long career with the United States Air Force , with 21 examples later modified to F-4 G Wild Weasel specifications and used by the 35th and 52nd TFWs .

EGYPT
Section::::Egypt .
The Al Quwwat al Jawwiya il Misriya ( Egyptian Air Force or EAF ) encountered Israeli F-4s during fighting between the two states , especially during the later stages of the War of Attrition and the 1973 Yom Kippur War .
These encounters gave the EAF a measure of the type 's effectiveness , especially as a bomber .
After the Camp David Accords , and the Egypt – Israel Peace Treaty signed on 26 March 1979 , Egypt ended its military dependence on the Soviet Union .
It also lost the financial support of the other Arab states , and Saudi Arabia cancelled its plans to send Egypt 50 F-5s .
The U.S. State Department proposed trading Egypt new military hardware in exchange for military aircraft made in the USSR , including MiG-21s , and the newer MiG-23s delivered to them by the Soviets prior to their breakdown of relations in 1976 .
Under the September 1977 Peace Pharaoh agreement , 35 ex-31 TFW F-4Es along with a number of Sparrow , Sidewinder and Maverick missiles were supplied to the EAF for US$ 594 million and served with 76 and 78 Squadrons of the 222 Fighter Regiment .
Initially Egyptian ground crews found their maintenance far more complex than required for Soviet aircraft and consequently there was an average of only nine F-4s serviceable during 1982 , a 26 % serviceability rate .
To correct the situation , Egypt considered selling some of the F-4s to Turkey and buying extra F-16s .
However , assistance from U.S. advisors in 1985 made it possible to reach a reasonable serviceability rate , and in 1988 another seven F-4s were delivered .
While further purchases of F-4s and upgrades were considered , these plans were rejected in favour of additional orders for F-16s .
By the end of the 1990s , three aircraft had crashed but were replaced with three others .
As of 2018 the two squadrons of F-4s are retired and are in storage / reserve .

GERMANY
Section::::Germany .
The German Air Force ( Luftwaffe ) operated a total of 175 F-4Fs , 10 F-4Es ( for training at U.S. airfields ) and 88 RF-4Es making it one of the most prolific Phantom customers .
In 1971 the new West German Luftwaffe was only 16 years old , having been formed in 1955 .
In this short time , the air force had already passed through two generations of jet combat aircraft , having bought the North American F-86 Sabre and the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter .
By the early 1970s , the Luftwaffe had a formidable fighter strength , consisting of two interceptor , two reconnaissance and five bomber wings with F-104Gs , plus four light attack wings with
Aeritalia G.91Rs .
RF-4E Section::::RF-4E.
The first F-4 model to enter German service was the RF-4E.
The Luftwaffe signed a contract with McDonnell Douglas for 88 RF-4Es in 1968 ; at the time the biggest order outside the USAF .
The contract included industrial offsets for German industry , particularly production work for Messerschmitt - Bölkow - Blohm who manufactured and supplied F-4 components to McDonnell Douglas ' Phantom production facility in St. Louis .
On 16 January 1971 the first RF-4E , dubbed the " Spirit of St. Louis " , flew from the U.S. to Spain and finally onto Germany .
The next day , at Bremgarten , the aircraft was accepted by the Inspekteur der Luftwaffe ( " Inspector of the Luftwaffe " , Gunther Rall .
In 1972 , with eight Phantoms per month being delivered , Aufklärungsgeschwader 51 " Immelmann " equipped with the RF-4 , followed by AG 52 , based at Leck .
The German RF-4E was equipped similarly to the USAF RF-4Cs , using the latest F-4E airframe and more - powerful engines .
The RF-4Es were employed as day / night reconnaissance aircraft , equipped with four cameras covering 180 degrees .
There were special flares for night use and two night / all - weather reconnaissance systems .
One was the IRRS ( Infrared Recognition System ) and the other was the SLAR ( Side - Looking Airborne Radar ) , mounted in the side of the fuselage .
The aircraft had the capability to develop photos in flight and then drop them using special cartridges .
Missions were generally flown at low level and high speed , using the installed APQ-99 radar for navigation .
Deliveries were completed in May 1972 and the previously employed RF-104Gs were modified to serve in strike or fighter units .
F-4F Section::::F-4F.
The Luftwaffe also intended to equip two fighter and two bomber Geschwader ( " wings " ) with a simplified single - seat version of the F-4E Phantom which had already been proposed for the TFX USAF program .
This was reconsidered due to the cost of that version and instead , under the Peace Rhine program , the Luftwaffe purchased the F-4F , which was based on the F-4E.
The F-4F had one of the seven fuselage fuel tanks omitted along with the capability to carry AIM-7 Sparrow missiles and bombs .
It was equipped with air combat maneuvering leading edge slats and had a higher thrust to weight ratio , approaching 1:1 when fuel was low .
The first example , serial number 3701 , first flew on 18 March 1973 .
The first eight were sent to George AFB where crew training was carried out .
In 1976 , these trainers were replaced with 10 F-4Es , which stayed in the U.S.
One of the " F"s , serial number 72 - 118 , remained at Eglin AFB as an experimental project aircraft .
Units equipped with F-4F included Jagdgeschwader 71 " Richthofen " , Wittmund , commencing in May 1974 , and Jagdgeschwader 74 " Mölders " , Neuburg an der Donau , September 1975 .
In April 1975 , deliveries started to JaboG 36 , Rheine - Hopsten and finally JaboG 35 , Pferdsfeld .
Operationally , the F-4Fs used by JG 71 and JG 74 were employed in the air - to - air role , while those used by JaboG 35 and 36 were used in air - to - air and air - to - ground roles .
Weapons used on the F-4F included the Mk 82 retarded bomb , BL755 cluster bomb unit and AIM-9 Sidewinders .
Later on , an AGM-65 Maverick capability was added , with a pair of missiles housed in a single launcher .
AIRCREW TRAINING Section::::Aircrew training .
Luftwaffe aircrew training was conducted by the USAF at Sheppard AFB .
The program included 13 months flying the T-37 and T-38 , for a total of 200 hours for pilots and 85 hours for navigators .
Training in Europe was limited to a minimum of 500 ft ( 150 m ) altitude , with special ranges permitting flight as low as 200 ft ( 60 m ) .
Advanced training was conducted in Canada at CFB Goose Bay and at Decimomannu in Sardinia .
LOSSES Section::::Losses .
By 1990 , Phantom losses were 21 F-4Fs and 15 RF-4Es .
RF-4E UPGRADES AND DISPOSAL Section::::RF-4E upgrades and disposal .
Reconnaissance Phantom updates were carried out during several separate programs .
Under the Peace Trout program , one RF-4E upgrade had an ELINT system installed in the nose , based on the APR-39 of the F-4G. Another RF-4E update was the installation of provision for bombs with up to six BL-755 , or 5,000 lb ( 2,268 kg ) of other external stores , and an ALE-40 chaff launcher along with a bombing system and newer cameras .
In 1988 , the aircraft were stood down from this dual role due to cost and this capability was removed .
After the reduction of conventional forces in Europe , the Luftwaffe began phasing out the RF-4Es in 1993–94 .
The surplus aircraft were supplied to Allied NATO nations , with 32 sent to Turkey and 20 to Greece .
AG 51 received Panavia Tornados as a replacement , while AG 52 was disbanded .
F-4F UPGRADES AND DISPOSAL Section::::F-4F upgrades and disposal .
A total of 12 F-4Fs were initially modified for dual controls and were later de - modified .
In 1980–83 , the F-4F fleet was fitted with air - refueling probes , utilizing USAF tankers to make longer flights to Canada and Spain .
The AIM-9B and F were replaced with the " L " version Sidewinder .
The " ICE " ( Improved Combat Efficiency ) program commenced in 1983 to upgrade the F-4F 's air - to - air capabilities .
This involved the APG-65 radar and AIM-120 AMRAAM as the main elements , along with many minor upgrades .
The original plan was to upgrade 75 F-4Fs , but the number was increased to 110 in the late 1980s .
Initially , the ICE upgrades were intended only for the interceptor wings , but more were upgraded due to delays in the Eurofighter Typhoon program .
Phase 1 of ICE commenced in 1989–90 and included upgrades such as the ALR-68 Radar warning receiver , the Honeywell H-423 laser gyro inertial navigation system , the GEC Avionics CPU-143 / A digital central air data computer , and the Mil Std 1553R digital data bus .
In July 1989 , the first F-4F ICE Phase 2 aircraft was completed , and on 22 November 1991 the first firing of an AIM-120 AMRAAM took place .
In 1992 , the first batch of six upgraded aircraft was delivered to JG 71 ( Fighter Wing 71 ) , but the AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles were not available at that time .
The F-4Fs were employed to fill operational gaps twice ; the first time due to Panavia Tornado delays , while the F-4F ICE was needed due to the Eurofighter Typhoon delays .
The units equipped with F-4F ICE were JG 71 , JG 72 , JG 74 and JG 73 .
This latter was a mixed unit , sent to Preschen airbase and had one staffel of F-4s and one with MiG-29s .
This was a unique situation , until the phasing out of the Fulcrums .
The F-4F ICE program offered a reasonably inexpensive and capable aircraft for the interceptor role , albeit with limitations .
Apart from natural deficiencies of the air frame design itself , the greatest drawbacks of the F-4F ICE were the lack of an IFF and MIDS capability .
In beyond - visual - range scenarios , it therefore had to rely on target - identification by AWACS aircraft with which it had to communicate in a conventional voice - based manner .
This together with the low number of procured AIM-120Bs ( only 96 , because Germany has ordered the MBDA Meteor , which however will not be available until 2013 ) and the outdated APG-65 radar made it a rather defensive system .
In 1992–94 the EFA program was reviewed by German Defence Minister Volker Rühe and there was extensive debate about the Luftwaffe ' s future .
At the end of 1994 , there were about 70 F-4F ICE aircraft already modified , 40 were still waiting for APG-65 radar , and 40 were not modified but still in service .
The costs sustained in the upgrades had incurred a delay in AMRAAM acquisition .
At that time , it was hoped that the AIM-120 could be received by 2005 and then there were only funds for 96 missiles with an option for 288 more .
The program review considered ending F-4F conversions and buying new fighters as " gap fillers " , such as the MiG-29 , McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle or F-16 .
There was doubt that even a simplified version of the Typhoon could be acquired .
The review resulted in F-4F ICE being completed .
The lack of AMRAAMs was a serious handicap and the MiG 29s were retained for longer than had been planned .
The ICE F-4Fs were expected to remain in service until JG 71 transitioned to the Eurofighter Typhoon in 2013 .
JG 73 retired its last F-4F in 2002 and replaced it with Eurofighters in 2003 , while the last F-4F left JG-74 in March 2008 .
The remaining F-4F wings were disbanded without replacement during the 1990s and early 2000s .
The German Air Force retired its last operational F-4F Phantom IIs on 29 June 2013 .
The Phantoms ' retirement was attended by a crowd of 130,000 people at an open day at Wittmundhafen Air Base .
German F-4F Phantoms flew 279,000 hours from entering service on 31 August 1973 to retirement on 29 June 2013 .

At the end of the 1960s , the Hellenic Air Force ( PA - Polemikí Aeroporía ) embarked upon a modernization program by ordering 40 Dassault Mirage F.1s and a total of 56 F-4Es along with six RF-4Es .
The final batch of 40 F-4Es were cancelled when a PASOK government was elected in 1981 .
The first 18 Greek Phantoms entered in service in 1974 , partially funded by U.S. military assistance under " Operation Icarus " .
However , they did not enter service in time to fight in the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 .
A second batch of F-4Es plus two extra aircraft were delivered in 1976 , followed by a final batch in 1978–79 .
The first units equipped were the 339th Squadron in 1974 in the air - to - air role and also as the operational training unit ; and the 338th Squadron , in 1975 in the ground - attack role .
The 337th " Ghost " Squadron was equipped in 1978 , giving up their Northrop F-5As .
The 348th " Eyes " Squadron relinquished their RF-84Fs for new RF-4Es in 1979 .
The old RF-84Fs were retained until 1990 for training purposes .
The last batch of 40 Phantoms was not delivered due to the political situation in Greece , but with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the US - led Operation Desert Storm liberation , the situation changed .
The USAF phased out many older aircraft and some were supplied to the PA as a thank - you for the use of Greek airbases during the war .
These included 10 ex - Indiana Air National Guard aircraft , later followed by another 18 .
By 1992 , there were four squadrons equipped with 73 F-4Es and 5 RF-4Es : the 348th and 337th squadrons in Larissa with the 110th Combat Wing , and 338th and 339th squadrons at Andravida with the 117th Combat Wing .
There were many differences between the batches supplied to the Hellenic Air Force .
The 338th " Ares " Squadron had an air - to - surface role .
Their F-4Es were equipped with digital processors for the APG-120 , laser inertial navigation systems , digital data buses , smoke - reduction systems and various structural improvements .
The 339th " Ajax " Squadron was employed in the air defense role with the older Phantoms , which had a Radar Warning Receiver mounted on the tail and air intakes , and the TISEO optical device .
UPGRADES AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS Section::::Upgrades and further developments .
One of the first measures taken by the PA was to increase the number of reconnaissance RF-4Es in their fleet , to augment the existing six .
They were able to do this in 1993 when the Luftwaffe phased out their RF-4Es , and 29 ex - Luftwaffe aircraft were added to the 348th Mira .
This last batch brought the number of F-4s serving with the PA to 121 .
Other programs saw the upgrade of several Greek Phantoms to carry out anti - radar operations .
In 1993 the PA called for a major electronic upgrade for the F-4 fleet , involving the replacement of the APQ-120 with a new AMRAAM - capable system .
Contenders to conduct the upgrade were DASA , Rockwell International , and IAI .
IAI was ruled out because it was already involved with the Greek 's historical adversary , Turkey , upgrading their own Phantoms at this time .
DASA won the contract in August 1997 , dubbed " Peace Icarus 2000 " .
The Greek F-4s were upgraded to a similar standard as the Luftwaffe F-4F ICE , including APG-65 radar , a GEC - Marconi HUD and GPS / INS .
The first flight of an upgraded aircraft was on 28 April 1999 at Manching airbase .
In total 38 aircraft were upgraded , 37 of them by Hellenic Aerospace Industry , at Tanagra .
Phantoms were also provided with Rafael LITENING pods , capable of navigation , targeting and use of guided weapons , such as the AGM-65 Maverick .
With these improvements , the F-4 ICE and F-4 G " Wild Weasel " will remain an effective fighter well into the 21st century .
The RF-4E reconnaissance versions were retired on 5 May 2017 and 348 Squadron was deactivated .

Approximately 225 F-4Ds , F-4Es and RF-4Es were delivered to Iran , mostly during the 1960s and 70s .
The Nirouye Havai Shahanshahiye Iran ( Imperial Iranian Air Force ) enjoyed more attention from Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi than any other military branch .
By 1967 the air force had F-4Ds on order , at that time the most advanced Phantom model available .
The original order was for 16 aircraft ; the first of which arrived on 8 September 1968 , with another 16 added later , and were employed in several unsuccessful attempts to intercept Soviet MiG-25Rs .
These aircraft were also used for ground attack , and during one such mission , rebels in Oman shot one down .
In 1970 , the first reconnaissance RF-4Es were delivered .
Iran , with few fiscal restraints , followed that up with an order for 177 F-4Es .
The first of these arrived in March 1971 .
During a border clash in June 1975 , these F-4s , armed with AGM-65 Maverick missiles defeated an Iraqi armored ground formation .
The F-4Es changed the balance of power in the region ; they were not only effective on the battlefield , but available in large numbers as well .
After the fall of the Shah in the Iranian Revolution of 1979 , the situation changed dramatically .
In 1979 the U.S. placed an armament embargo on Iran , preventing it from getting many spare parts to keep the fleet flying .
To make matters worse , the new theocratic government carried out purges of suspected Shah loyalists in the armed forces , especially in the renamed Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force ( IRIAF ) .
The purges greatly weakened the air force and left the 180 Phantoms still in service , largely without trained air and ground crews .
The Iran –
Iraq War began in September 1980 with Saddam Hussein 's attack on Iran .
Hussein had equipped his air force with new aircraft , such as the MiG-23 and believed that Iran was in a weakened and vulnerable state following the revolution and subsequent purges .
The Iranian forces surprised him and fought back effectively .
Iraq failed to destroy the Iranian air force bases for several reasons , among them that Iraqi aircraft lacked the range to reach them .
Another reason was that Iranian air bases had been built for USAF deployment in case of war with the Soviet Union .
This meant that the bases were very large , well - dispersed and stocked with ample spare parts .
This made the targets difficult for the small Iraqi air force to destroy .
The Iraqi air force performed a very deep strike of more than 837 km ( 520 mi ) inside Iran , but this small formation was intercepted by two Iranian F-4s and one or two MiGs were lost .
F-4s struck back the following day in Operation Kaman 99 and destroyed many strategic Iraqi targets with bombs and missiles .
After these attacks against strategic targets , the F-4s struck tactical battlefield targets , destroying many Iraqi armored vehicles .
The Iraqi invasion was stopped within several weeks .
Due to battlefield and accidental losses and the lack of spare parts , by the mid-1980s there were just 20–30 Iranian Phantoms still flying .
The quantity of weapons and spare parts was not enough to sustain the fleet , but Iran is believed to have benefited from foreign assistance with clandestine shipments of up to 23 new airframes , plus spares from the U.S. and Israel ( during the Iran - Contra Affair ) , as well as from locally designed and reverse - engineered components and weapons , and incorporation of ex - Soviet and Chinese technology .
The aircraft of an Iranian F-4 pilot who deserted on 31 August 1984 to Saudi Arabia was examined and found to have Israeli and European spare parts installed .
Another deserting F-4 was less lucky , being intercepted and shot down by Saudi F-15 Eagles on 5 June 1984 .
F-4s took part in interdiction missions against oil tankers using AGM-65 Maverick missiles and even AIM-9 Sidewinder air - to - air missiles , while bombs were not used , probably due to shortages .
In the 21st century , the Iranian government still has between 50–75 F-4s in service .
Among these , there are still some original F-4Ds updated with improved avionics , including limited look - down radar .
On 30 November 2014 , Al Jazeera reported that an Iranian F-4 had conducted an airstrike in Iraq against Islamic State militants .
The United States confirmed the attack several days later , but Iran did not confirm or deny Iranian airstrikes had taken place ; both denied they coordinated any sort of air attack against IS forces in Iraq .

ISRAEL Section::::Israel .
Israel first expressed interest in the F-4 in 1965 , but the U.S. was unwilling to provide them at that time .
However , due to the embargo imposed by France after the Israeli preemptive strike during the 1967 Six - Day War , the U.S. government reconsidered and decided to offer the Israelis the aircraft .
The first aircraft delivered were F-4Es , provided under the " Peace Echo " program , authorized on 7 January 1968 , by president Lyndon Johnson , and supported by Senator Robert Kennedy .
About 220 F-4Es and RF-4Es were delivered to Israel between 1969 and 1976 under U.S. aid programs , and served with the Tsvah Haganah le
Israel / Heyl
Ha'Avir ( Israeli Air Force ) .
The F-4E was known as Kurnass ( Heavy Hammer ) in Israeli service while the RF-4E was called Orev ( Raven ) .
Formal acceptance of the first F-4Es came on 5 September 1969 , with Golda Meir and Moshe Dayan present for the ceremony .
By 22 October , the new aircraft were in operation , attacking Egyptian targets .
On 11 November 1969 an F-4E first shot down a MiG-21 , while on 2 April 1970 , the first F-4 was downed by a MiG. Egyptian fighters had a hard time dealing with the F-4s , and their SA-2 Surface - to - air missiles ( SAMs ) were not effective at low altitudes .
To address the problem , SA-3s were shipped to Egypt , along with up to 5,000 Soviet advisers .
In a fierce aerial battle on 30 July 1970 , four Phantoms baited the Egyptian MiGs which this time were Soviet - manned .
Up to five MiGs were shot down when eight Israeli Mirages , flying at low level , jumped them , achieving complete surprise .
Late June and early July 1970 was a difficult time for the new F-4s , with two shot down by SAMs on 30 June , another on 5 July and two on 18 July .
A total of 24 Phantoms were delivered under Peace Echo II and III .
Operation Night Light involved the loan of two RF-4Cs to the IDF while they were waiting for their order for six RF-4Es to be delivered .
Operation Peace Patch involved another batch of 12 Phantoms , delivered in 1971 .
Israeli F-4Es scored 116.5 aerial victories against Arab aircraft , including two Su-7s shot down on 9 September 1972 and a Libyan Boeing 727 in January 1973 .
Peace Echo IV brought another 52 F-4s to the IDF , 24 of which were ex - USAF .
These were delivered between April 1972 and October 1973 , when the Yom Kippur War broke out .
At that time there were 122 F-4E and 6 RF-4Es in service with the IDF .
Israeli Phantoms scored 11 air victories during this period although several were lost , mainly to SAMs , but above all they inflicted heavy damage on Egyptian land forces during the War of Attrition .
YOM KIPPUR WAR Section::::Yom Kippur War .
The Yom Kippur War started with Egyptian and Syrian air strikes on Israel .
During this opening phase a pair of Phantoms managed to shoot down seven Egyptian aircraft , and others shot down five Mil Mi-8s carrying assault troops over the Sinai desert .
On the second day of the war , the IDF launched attacks with F-4s and A-4 Skyhawks but the enemy air defence and MiGs shot down six Phantoms and 30 A-4s .
The new SA-6 Gainful missile systems and ZSU-23 - 4
Shilka mobile guns were much more effective than the old SA-2 Guideline .
The SA-6 uses semi - active radar homing , paired with Straight Flush radar which operates in the G , H , I and J bands , making it very difficult to jam .
The Israeli ALR-36 radar warning receivers were ineffective against this system .
Some aerial maneuvers were believed to fool the SA-6 systems and these were used while the IDF waited for better ECM weapons .
Some of the maneuvers were quite effective , but the SA-6 threat was only reduced on 9 October 1973 when A-4s surprised many SA-6 batteries without their missiles ready to fire and destroyed them .
That same day another F-4 strike hit the Damascus HQ of the Syrian Army .
By the middle of October , 37 Phantoms had been lost in combat and another six were damaged beyond repair .
U.S. President Richard Nixon authorized the delivery of 36 ex - USAF F-4s under Operation Nickel Grass , from the USAF 4th and 401st Tactical Fighter Wings .
These aircraft were flown directly to Israel , some by U.S. pilots .
At least one F-4E flew in combat still bearing a U.S. tail code , while others stayed painted in USAF camouflage patterns .
During the war Israeli Phantoms first used the new AGM-65 Maverick missile .
Israel employed three F-4E(S ) , which were equipped with a special high - altitude camera system ( HIAC ) for reconnaissance missions .
These RF-4Es were special high - performance Phantoms , with the same cameras planned for the Mach 3.2 RF-4X that was cancelled in 1975 .
The camera performed well but mounting it in an external pod caused too much drag , so it was installed in the nose of three normal F-4Es instead .
During the Yom Kippur War it was reported that one Israeli F-4 Squadron was put on alert for a nuclear strike , but not confirmed .
After several weeks of combat , losses included four F-4s delivered under the Nickel Grass program .
POST 1973 PERIOD
Section::::Post 1973 period .
After the war Peace Echo V provided Israel with 24 new , 24 ex - USAF and 6 RF-4Es , completing the program in November 1976 .
Given that almost all the Israeli F-4s had suffered battle damage , an update to increase their capabilities and standardize the various production blocks was commenced in 1974 .
The IDF Phantoms received Elbit Jason digital bombing computers , Litton LW-33 inertial navigation systems , new radar warning receivers , TISEO and combat slats .
IDF Phantoms took part in many other battles , among them Operation Mole Cricket 19 in June 1982 , when Syrian SA-6 sites were destroyed by a coordinated attack made by IDF aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles .
By that time , new F-15 Eagles and F-16s were replacing the Phantom in front line service , so the F-4s scored only one aerial victory in that action .
WEAPONS Section::::Weapons .
Among the weapons carried on IDF F-4s were the Gabriel , AGM-45 , AGM-68 , Shafir and Python missiles .
UPGRADES Section::::Upgrades .
The planned program to replace the original J79 engines with the Pratt & Whitney PW1120 was cancelled , but the fleet was updated to Kurnass 2000 standards .
This upgrade included installation of a wide - angle Kaiser HUD , a digital mission computer and some structural improvements .
The main updates involved the APG-76 radar , Elbit ACE-3 mission computer , HOTAS , the addition of winglets for increased agility , ASX-1 TISEO and the ability to deploy Popeye missiles .
The upgraded aircraft first flew on 15 July 1987 and was formally accepted on 11 August 1987 .
The Kurnass program was also used to upgrade Turkish Air Force Phantoms at the same time , realizing some economies of scale .
Israeli Phantoms have suffered at least 55 combat losses but accounted for 116.5 claimed air victories .
By the end of the 20th Century there were still 112 F-4s serving with the IDF , in three Squadrons : the 119 , 142 and 201 .

Japan selected the F-4 Phantom II as its new fighter at the end of the 1960s .
On 1 November 1968 , this choice was made public and Japan became one of the few countries that license - produced this aircraft .
The Nihon Koku Jietai ( Japan Air Self - Defense Force , JASDF ) received a total of 154 F-4EJ and RF-4Es .
While the F-4EJs were built almost entirely by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries , the RF-4Es were bought directly from McDonnell - Douglas .
Due to Japanese military limitations prohibiting air - to - ground ordnance , the F-4EJs were delivered without the AN / AJB-7 bombing computer system and also did not have an air - refueling probe or receptacle .
In service F-4EJs replaced the JASDF 's fleet of Lockheed F-104 J Starfighters .
McDonnell Douglas built the two prototype F-4EJs , which first flew on 14 January 1971 .
The next 11 aircraft were assembled in Japan and the first Japanese - built example flew on 12 May 1972 .
Mitsubishi built all the EJs over the next nine years and the production ended with 127th F-4EJ , on 20 May 1981 .
This was the last F-4 built in the world .
Fourteen RF-4Es were delivered between November 1974 and June 1975 .
These were similar to the RF-4C , but , as for the F - EJs , Japanese - built radar warning receivers and other equipment were substituted to replace equipment which was not released for export to Japan .
The F-4EJ entered service with the JASDF in August 1972 with a total of six Hikōtai ( " Squadrons " ) operating the aircraft : the 301 , 302 , 303 , 304 , 305 and 306th .
The RF-4EJ equipped the 501st , that had previously operated one of the less - well - known Sabre models , the RF-86F. Japanese procurement involved small , multi - year orders , which made for slow production of small batches ordered every year .
As of 2007 , Japan has a fleet of 90 F-4s currently in service .
Talks are underway to replace them with Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft , since the sale of the American F-22 Raptor is currently blocked by U.S. export restrictions .
In June 2007 , Lockheed Martin announced that the company has been awarded a contract to equip several F-15 Eagles with synthetic aperture radar pods .
These F-15s will be used in a reconnaissance role , allowing the RF-4EJ to be retired ; the F-4 having served from the 1970s into the 21st century .
UPGRADES Section::::Upgrades .
To upgrade the Phantom fleet the JASDF planned the F-4EJ Kai ( Japanese for " modified " ) program .
This involved 110 aircraft , later reduced to 96 , which were upgraded with APG-66 radar , ground attack capabilities and most importantly , ASM-1 or ASM-2 anti - ship missiles ( two mounted under the wings ) .
This boosted their capabilities in the anti - shipping role ; filling in for the indigenous Mitsubishi F-1s which were too few in number and lacked range , and the P-3Cs which were too slow , even if well - armed with Harpoon missiles .
The F-4EJ Kai upgrade added several other air - to - surface weapons to the F-4 , including bombs and rockets .
RF-4Es were upgraded to RF-4 Kai standard with AN / APQ-172 TFR radar , and the J / APR-2 RWR was replaced with the J / APR-5 ;
both Japanese - designed systems .
Seventeen
F-4EJs were also converted to RF-4EJ configuration , which , while mounting no internal cameras , carried podded reconnaissance equipment .
Among the systems installed were TACER ( electronic reconnaissance pod with datalink ) ,
TAC ( pod with KS-135A and KS-95B cameras ) , D-500UR IR detection system , and the LOROP pod ( with a KS-146B camera ) .
The F-4EJ Kai first flew on 17 July 1984 , and first F-4EJ Kai was delivered on 24 November 1989 to the JASDF 306th Squadron .
It was fitted the smaller and more lightweight AN / APG-66J pulse Doppler radar and a heads - up display resulting in a lookdown / shootdown capability .
The central computer was updated , as well as the J / APR-6 homing and warning system , IFF system and the inertial navigation unit .
The first F-4EJ Kai aircraft were delivered to the 306 Hikōtai at Komatsu , but within a few years they were replaced by F-15Js .
In April 1994 the F-4 strength was reduced to three squadrons : 8 ( Misawa ) , 301 ( Nyutabaru ) and 306 ( Naha , Okinawa ) .
The 501st at that time operated the RF-4EJ .
Over time the F-4s and F-1s are being replaced with the new Mitsubishi F-2 , an enlarged development of the F-16 developed jointly with Lockheed Martin .

The Daehan Min - guk Gong - gun ( Republic of Korea Air Force , RoKAF ) was supplied with F-4s in the late 1960s , due to ongoing tension with North Korea .
Seoul ordered 18 ex - USAF F-4Ds , which were quickly delivered under the Peace Spectator program .
They served with the 110th TFS , 11th Fighter Wing based at Daegu .
In 1972 another 18 were delivered from the USAF 3rd TFW ( Tactical Fighter Wing ) , in exchange for which South Korea delivered 36 Northrop F-5As to South Vietnam .
Several more F-4s were delivered in the following years , with the last batch delivered in 1987–88 .
These were equipped with Pave Tack laser designators , an important feature that allowed the use of laser - guided bombs .
A total of 92 F-4Ds were delivered , making this air force the main export customer for the " D " model .
The F-4Ds were joined by 37 new - build F-4Es , ordered in the 1970s .
The last of these was the 5,068th F-4 built in St. Louis .
Under Operation Peace Pheasant these were delivered to the RoKaF 152 and 153 TFS ( Tactical Fighter Squadron ) ,
17th TFW at Chongju .
This was only the beginning of South Korean F-4 acquisitions , as more ex - USAF F-4Es were delivered in the next few years , giving a total of 103 F-4Es .
The South Koreans also received RF-4Cs .
There were 12 ex - USAF 460 TRG ( Tactical Reconnaissance Group , disbanded in 1990 ) that were sent to the South Korean 131st TRS ( Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron ) , 39 TRG , at Suwon Air Base , along with another 11 sent later .
ALQ-131
electronic countermeasures pods were also delivered .
Overall , South Korea was one of the main customers of the F-4 , with 216 delivered , including 60 " D " models , 55 " E " models and 18 RF-4Cs in service in 2000 .
UPGRADES Section::::Upgrades .
The South Korean Air Force has been quite satisfied with the F-4 and has carried out upgrades to extend their lifespan .
A proposal made by DASA was evaluated that would have included installation of the APG-66 radar and AMRAAM missiles .
This was equivalent to the Japanese F-4EJ KAI or German F-4 ICE , but the costs were too high for South Korea .
The Air Force had already been forced to cancel an order for F-18s , which had been the winner of their new fighter competition and instead bought F-16 Fighting Falcons .
Despite the financial constraints , several minor upgrades were made to allow South Korean F-4s to continue in their role against North Korea .
Some F-4s were upgraded with the AN / AVQ-26 Pave Tack laser targeting pod .
30 F-4Es were equipped with the AGM-142 " Popeye " stand - off air - to - surface missile ; a modern Israeli weapon also purchased by the USAF , Royal Australian Air Force and the Turkish Air Force .

Through the Mutual Defense Aid Program ( MDAP ) , Spain acquired 36 ex - USAF F-4Cs for the Ejército del Aire ( Spanish Air Force ) .
These were the only " C " models ever exported , even as second - hand examples .
Deliveries occurred between October 1971 and September 1972 under Peace Alfa .
At the time of delivery these F-4Cs were already obsolete , but they replaced even older aircraft , F-104Gs and F-86Fs .
In Spanish Air Force use , the F-4Cs were designated " C.12 " ( C stood for " Caza " and 12 stood for " 12th fighter type in service since the creation of the Ejército del Aire " ) .
The F-4Cs were assigned to Escuadrones 121 and 122 , Ala 12 ( Wing ) .
To support them a fleet of three KC-97Ls was acquired in 1972 , equipping Escuadrón 123 , being replaced by KC-130Hs ( which equipped Escuadrón 301 ) from January 1976 .
While the KC-97s were fitted with a flying boom refuelling system , the Hercules that replaced them were fitted with the probe and drogue system and so could not refuel
the F-4s . Further F-4 deliveries took place in October 1978 , with the addition of four F-4Cs and four RF-4Cs .
The RF-4Cs were given the Spanish designation CR.12 .
During their service , seven F-4C were lost to accidents before being replaced by EF-18s in April 1989 .
The RF-4Cs continued to serve in the reconnaissance role along with another eight ex - USAF RF-4C delivered in 1989 in the 123 Squadron , that operated from Torrejón airbase .
This batch of RF-4Cs was updated to the highest USAF standard prior to delivery and had a completely revised avionic suite , including new radios , RWR , VOR and ILS navigation equipment and KS-86 cameras .
These aircraft also had J79-GE-15E " smokeless " engines .
In 1995 the older F-4s were retired and six more RF-4Cs were obtained .
The new RF-4Cs had newer avionics , including Have Quick digital UHF / VHF radios , Itek AN / ARL-46 RWR , and Tracor AN / ALE-40 dispensers .
The upgrades included provisions for up to four AIM-9L Sidewinder missiles , for self - defence and to provide a secondary capability as an interceptor .
The existing fleet underwent a standardization program which among other changes included replacing the APQ-99 terrain - following radar by a Texas Instruments AN / APQ-172 radar , laser - ring gyro inertial navigation system and an Israeli Aircraft Industries in - flight refueling probe , while the original USAF - style refuelling receptacle was retained .
These improvements allowed the Spanish RF-4C fleet to serve into the 21st century , finally being retired in 2002 .
TURKEY Section::::Turkey .
One of the most prominent Phantom users is the Turkish Air Force ( " Türk Hava Kuvvetleri " or THK ) , which operates about 233 F-4s .
Under the Peace Diamond
I program 40 F-4Es were ordered , with deliveries starting in June 1974 , although completion of the order was delayed by an arms embargo following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus .
These aircraft equipped 161 Filo ( Squadron ) at 6 Ana Jet Us ( Jet - aircraft air Base , also called JAB ) .
After re - equipping with F-16Cs these Phantoms were sent to 7 JAB for 171 and 172
Filo .
Filo 173 at the same base was the Operational Conversion Unit .
Peace Diamond III was an additional phase of the plan to reinforce the THK , always striving to keep a balance with the Greek Hellenic Air Force , because even though both are NATO countries , Greece and Turkey are historical enemies and there have been air clashes over the Aegean Sea between them .
Filo 111 , 112 , 113 , all based on JAB 1 , Eskişehir , were the new Phantom units .
The 111th and 112th Filo received 32 F-4Es replacing their aging F-100s .
The 113 Filo replaced their even older RF-84Fs with eight RF-4Es .
With this last batch of F-4s and plans to acquire F-16 Fighting Falcons , the THK was quickly being modernized .
Before these aircraft arrived the THK had operated fighters such as the F-104 Starfighter , F-100 Super Sabre , F-84 Thunderflash and the F-86 Sabre , plus the economical F-5 Freedom Fighter .
With 80 Phantoms on order , the strength of the THK was increased to new levels .
Other fighters , seen as supplemental to the F-4E , were purchased as well .
These included 40 Aeritalia F-104Ss , the improved Starfighter , with the same missiles and engines as used on the Phantoms .
These equipped Filo 142 and 172 .
Compared to the F-4s they were considerably less expensive and were used as interceptors .
The Turkish F-4 fleet was enhanced with 15 secondhand US aircraft delivered in 1981 to Filo 173 and finally , another 15 delivered in 1984 to replace fleet losses .
Peace Diamond IV was another program to reinforce the THK and was carried out between June and October 1987 .
Under this program 40 F-4Es were delivered to 131 and 132 Filo , 3 JAB , Konya .
Before that , this wing was only a training unit equipped with the last Turkish F-100s .
After the conversion it became an operational formation .
Turkey assisted in Desert Storm without entering the fighting directly , by opening their airbases to the Coalition air forces and hosted Belgian Mirages , German Alpha Jets and Italian F-104Gs .
As a reward for their help another 40 former US Air Force Phantoms were delivered to 112 and 172 Filo , beginning on 25 March 1991 .
At that time , the USAF was phasing - out large quantities of older aircraft , reducing their strength by over 1,000 F-4C / D / Es .
But even if old , these aircraft were desirable to countries like Turkey who already had F-4 fleets .
The U.S. did not have enough RF-4s to sell to meet international demands , so when the German Air Force phased out their remaining 88 RF-4Es during 1992–93 , 32 were delivered to the THK in 1992–94 .
All of these went to 113 Filo , Eskişehir .
Later , when 173 Filo passed their F-4Es to 172 Filo , they equipped with RF-4Es .
By the end of that reorganization , Filo 171 became a ground attack unit , 172 interception and 173 reconnaissance .
That delivery completed the THK F-4 fleet .
OPERATIONAL USE Section::::Operational use .
Many of the Turkish Phantoms are used as ground attack aircraft , a role they performed well due to the systems installed .
The first Phantoms delivered to the THK had Southeast Asia camouflage colors and TISEO equipment , consisting of a wing - mounted television camera with zoom capacity for spotting targets outside of normal visual range .
The F-4s acquired from US Air Force stocks were former 110th and 141st Tactical Fighter Squadron aircraft ( Missouri and New Jersey Air National Guard squadrons , respectively ) and arrived painted in " Egyptian One " camouflage , an air - superiority paint scheme consisting of two different shades of blue , despite being best - suited for ground attack .
The last batch delivered had AVQ-23A Pave Spike laser designation pod compatibility .
In September 2010 , U.S. Army spokeswoman Lt . Col . Tamara Parker confirmed a combined Chinese - Turkish exercise that ran from 20 September through 4 October at the Konya air base in Turkey 's central Anatolia region .
According to Reuters , a portion of the exercise included mock aerial combat between Turkish F-4s and Russian - built Su-27s of the Chinese military .
It was reported that the Turks defeated the Chinese aircraft in air combat exercises .
On 22 June 2012 , the Turkish government announced that Syrian forces had shot down a Turkish RF-4E from 113 Filo with two crew members over the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Hatay Province , which borders the Syrian Latakia Governorate .
The aircraft is reported to have been conducting a reconnaissance flight off the Syrian coast .
The Turkish release suggested that the Turkish government did not immediately view the Syrian action as provocative , and it acknowledged that Syrian assets were assisting efforts to find the aircraft and crew .
The Syrian Armed Forces made a statement carried by the official Syrian Arab News Agency crediting its antiaircraft gunners with downing an unidentified aircraft flying at " very low altitude and at high speed " over Syria 's territorial waters toward land less than a mile offshore , causing it to crash into the sea west of the village of Om al - Tuyour .
Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi said " the downing was an accident , caused by the ' automatic response ' of an officer commanding an anti - aircraft gun .
The man saw a jet coming at him at high speed and low altitide and opened fire , Makdissi said .
" The statement went on to claim that the aircraft was found to be a " Turkish military plane that entered Syrian airspace and was dealt with according to laws observed in such cases . "
The downing occurred at a time of heightened tensions between the two countries due to Turkish support for Syrian rebels opposed to the Bashar al - Assad regime in Damascus .
On 24 June , wreckage of the F-4 was located in Syrian waters , but the crew had not been found .
On 24 February 2015 , two RF-4Es crashed in the Malatya region in southeast Turkey , under unknown cumstances , killing all four crew members .
On 5 March 2015 , an F-4E-2020 crashed in central Anatolia killing both crew .
Calls to scrap the F-4s and replace them with the fifth generation F-35s were renewed .
UPGRADES Section::::Upgrades .
Buying a more sophisticated supersonic fighter , like the F-15 Eagle or Panavia Tornado , was too expensive and instead , the THK decided to upgrade its Phantom fleet with improvements to avionics and structure , but not to the engines .
In August 1995 , after a hotly contested competition with DASA ( F-4 ICE ) , IAI was awarded a USD600 M contract to upgrade 54 F-4Es to Phantom 2000s .
The first 26 aircraft were rebuilt in Israel , and the other 28 in Turkey .
STRUCTURE
Section::::Structure .
Small strakes above the air intakes to improve agility , new attachment fittings , engine mountings , stronger wing fold ribs , updated canopy sill bar , 12 mi ( 20 km ) of wiring replaced ( reducing weight by 1,653 lb/750 kg ) as well as most hydraulic and pneumatic lines and hoses , and fuel tank reinforcements .

AGM-88 HARM , GBU-8 HOBOS , GBU-10/12 Paveway II LGBs , general purpose and cluster bombs for air - to - ground missions , while retaining the capability to launch AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-9 Sidewinder air - to - air missiles .
It is also possible to install Pave Spike targeting pods and rocket pods of all sizes .
These upgraded F-4 Phantoms are referred to as the F-4E-2020 Terminator and current planning is that they will remain in service until 2020 , as the name suggests .
The first entered service on 27 January 2000 with deliveries to 111 and 171 Filo .

K ( PHANTOM FG.1 ) Section::::United Kingdom . Section::::F-4
K ( Phantom FG.1 ) .
Following cancellation of the supersonic V / STOL Hawker Siddeley P.1154 , the Royal Navy selected the Phantom as a replacement for the Supermarine Scimitar and de Havilland Sea Vixen .
The model requested was designated the F-4 K by McDonnell Douglas and received the British service designation Phantom FG.1 .
Ordered in July 1964 , this was the first time the U.S. permitted export of the Phantom , with the first F-4 K flying on 27 June 1966 .
To ease the impact on employment in the UK aircraft industry from the cancellation of home - grown programs , the aircraft had a high British content .
The main modification was the replacement of the General Electric J79 by the British - made Rolls - Royce Spey powerplant .
These engines ( RB 168 - 25R Spey Mk 202/203s ) were more powerful than the J79s ( 20,515 lbf/91.25 kN afterburning thrust ) and had a lower fuel consumption ( Specific fuel consumption was around 0.7 lb / hp.h ) .
The rear fuselage was heavily modified to accommodate the larger Speys and the air intakes enlarged to permit the greater airflow they required .
These aircraft were equipped with an AN / AWG-11 radar system , which was a version of the Westinghouse AN / AWG-10 built under licence by Ferranti , equipped with a Doppler unit to allow some basic look - down capabilities .
The bombing system was the anglicized version of the Lear / Siegler AN / ABJ-7 .
Fleet Air Arm Phantoms were fitted with a double - telescoping front landing gear strut that could extend 40 in ( 102 cm ) , the increased angle of attack being necessary for catapult launches from the smaller British carriers .
Other British contractors , including Short Brothers and British Aircraft Corporation , built sub - assemblies and supplied parts to the United States where the aircraft were assembled by McDonnell Douglas at Saint Louis .
A Spey - powered Phantom was not a new concept : McDonnell Douglas had considered the idea to meet the USAF TFX requirement , later satisfied by the General Dynamics F-111 .
The Spey gave an increase of 10 % in operational range , 15 % increase in ferry range and better low - level acceleration , however the increased drag of the engine installation resulted in poorer performance at high altitude .
Although some of the design changes were unique to the British aircraft – folding radar radome , Spey engine , nose - wheel extension and strengthened arrester hook – the other structural changes and improvements were used in the design of the F-4J.
After modifications in the 1970s , the tail had a new RWR system ; a British - made Marconi ARI.18228 fitted in a rectangular antenna box on the fin tip .
Initially , a total of 140 FG.1s were to be ordered for the Fleet Air Arm ; the intention was to operate the Phantom from both of the Royal Navy 's remaining large fleet carriers , Eagle and Ark Royal , and the brand new CVA-01 carriers .
However , the 1966 Defence White Paper saw the cancellation of the CVA-01 project , with the Royal Navy 's Phantom order cut to 48 .
This was intended to provide for two squadrons each of 12 aircraft to be operated from Eagle and Ark Royal , both of which were to be heavily modified .
While Ark Royal was undergoing conversion , the FG.1 underwent successful deck trials aboard Eagle .
In 1969 , however , the decision was taken that Eagle would not undergo conversion , leaving Ark Royal as the only Royal Navy carrier capable of operating the Phantom .
As a consequence , 20 of the Fleet Air Arm 's FG.1s were diverted to the Royal Air Force to equip 43 Squadron at RAF Leuchars in the air - defence role .
These aircraft were modified to enable them to carry the SUU-23 / A gun pods .
The units equipped were 700P Naval Air Squadron trials unit , 767 Naval Air Squadron training unit , and a single operational squadron , 892 Naval Air Squadron , all home based at Yeovilton .
892 NAS commissioned with the Phantom in 1969 , and embarked in Ark Royal for the first time in 1970 , making the Fleet Air Arm the only naval air arm outside the United States to operate the Phantom from the deck of an aircraft carrier .
Service with the Fleet Air Arm was brief , with 892 NAS operating from Ark Royal from 12 June 1970 to 27 November 1978 .
After that , the remaining FG.1s were transferred to the RAF to form 111 Squadron , a second air - defence squadron .
The two RAF squadrons converted to the Tornado F.3 in 1989 when the FG.1s were withdrawn from service .
F-4
M ( PHANTOM FGR.2 )
Section::::F-4 M ( Phantom FGR.2 ) .
With the cancellation of home - grown programmes and the need to replace the Hawker Hunter and English Electric Canberra in the ground - attack and tactical reconnaissance roles , the RAF ordered 118 aircraft in 1965 .
The aircraft were designated Phantom FGR.2 ( " Fighter / Ground attack / Reconnaissance " ) by the British and the prototype first flew on 17 February 1967 .
Like the Phantom FG.1 it was equipped with Spey engines and was externally identical , although it did not have the extendable nose - wheel .
It was fitted with an AN / AWG-12 radar and fire - control system , similar to the AN / AWG-11
but without the ability to fold the radome and antenna back to enable the aircraft to fit the lifts on an aircraft carrier , and Martin - Baker Mk .
H5 ejection seats .
The aircraft entered service from 1969 onwards with Nos . 2 , 6 , 14 , 17 , 31 ,
41 and 54 Squadrons in the close air support , tactical strike and tactical reconnaissance roles .
However , when the SEPECAT Jaguar entered service from 1974 onwards , the Phantom FGR.2s were redeployed in the air defence role , replacing English Electric Lightnings with Nos . 19 , 23 , 29 , 56 and 92
Squadrons .
Some FGR.2s were equipped with dual controls , and others could carry a reconnaissance pod that was equipped with a Texas Instruments RS-700 infrared linescan unit , high - definition sideways - looking radar and five optical cameras .
Although not deployed in a war role RAF Phantoms were involved in air - defence duties on Quick Reaction Alert .
This involved endless alarms to intercept " Bear " and other Soviet aircraft approaching British airspace , the North Sea and over Germany .
The fitting of RWRs and structural reinforcements were carried out to the aircraft in the 1970s .
In 1982 , an AIM-9-armed Phantom FGR.2 returning from a Quick Reaction Alert over Germany accidentally shot down a Royal Air Force Jaguar GR.1 .
In the strike role the FGR.2s could carry the SNEB rocket pod , 1,000 lb ( 454 kg ) bomb , the BL755 Cluster Bomb Unit , and U.S.-supplied B28 , B43 , B57 or B61 nuclear weapons .
It could also be fitted with SUU-16 / A and SUU-23 / A gun pods .
From 1975 the aircraft were modified with structural reinforcements and tail - mounted radar warning receivers .
When the aircraft took over the air - defence duties in the 1970s they carried either AIM-9 G Sidewinders or AIM-7 Sparrows , and later they would carry the then new British Aerospace Skyflash missile and the updated AIM-9L Sidewinder .
In the 1980s , the Tornado started to replace the Phantom in the air - defence role .
The Greek Air Force ( Polemiki Aeroporia , PA ) was interested in buying 32 aircraft in 1992 but the differences were too great between the FGR.2 and the F-4Es they operated .
F-4J(UK )
Section::::F-4J(UK ) .
The deployment of a squadron of Phantom FGR.2s to the Falkland Islands after the 1982 War left a gap in the RAF 's air defences .
With the Tornado ADV still some years from operational service , the RAF purchased 15 second - hand former U.S. Navy F-4J aircraft redesignated F-4J(UK ) , chosen from among the best stored at Davis - Monthan Air Force Base and upgraded to a level almost equal to the F-4S.
There was no official UK mark number for the type , despite the common but incorrect assumption that they would be designated " Phantom F.3 " in RAF service .
The main difference was the absence of combat slats as requested by the RAF , since they were considered to be a " source of drag " .
This also simplified the training of RAF crews as slats were not fitted to other RAF Phantoms .
The aircraft were totally overhauled at Naval Air Station North Island and fitted with AWG-10B radar ( having Skyflash missile guidance capability , with monopulse I band sensor ) , smokeless engines and provision for Skyflash missiles .
The first F-4J(UK ) was delivered to the RAF on 2 August 1984 and from there RAF crews delivered the aircraft to the UK after training .
They entered service with No . 74 Squadron RAF ( Tiger Squadron ) , based at RAF Wattisham in the air - defence role .
Crews liked the aircraft , and generally rated them better than the Spey - equipped FGR.2s .
They had a slower rate of climb due to the less - powerful engines , but they were also 1,670 lb ( 760 kg ) lighter and able , at altitude , to reach higher speeds ( Mach 2.3 at 45,000 ft/13,700 m , compared to Mach 2.1 at 36,000 ft/11,000 m ) .
The radar was also praised : " engines are good and the radar is excellent " in the words of a pilot .
Despite their age and the lack of combat slats these aircraft served well until being phased out in January 1991 in favour of surplus Phantom FGR.2s , before the Phantom was finally retired in 1992 .
After 25 years of service the Phantoms ended their RAF career : as a result of the Options for Change military budget reduction in 1990 , it was decided to phase out the Phantom .
These aircraft were designed for a lifetime of only 1,000 hours but were pushed to 5,800 hours , many of them flown at low - level .
First units to disband were the RAF Wildenrath - based 19 and 92 Squadrons , which were the last air defence units to serve in RAF Germany , followed by 56 Squadron in May 1992 .
The last Phantom squadron , 74 Squadron was disbanded on 1 October 1992 .
