HISTORY Section::::History .
47th–50th Streets –
Rockefeller Center opened in 1940 as part of the mainline portion of the IND Sixth Avenue Line to West Fourth Street –
Washington Square , with connections to the IND Queens Boulevard Line to the north .
Rockefeller Center 's underground mall , built in 1935 as part of the complex 's construction , contains passageways to the station .
Express service began in 1967 with the completion of express tracks between West Fourth and 34th Streets and the opening of the Chrystie Street Connection .
STATION LAYOUT Rockefeller Center via underground mallJamaica–179th Street ← toward Forest Hills–71st Avenue weekdays Northbound express ← toward Bedford Park Boulevard rush hours , 145th Street middays and evenings ← toward Norwood–205th StreetConey Island – Stillwell Avenue via
Culver →Brighton Beach weekdays → toward Coney Island – Stillwell Avenue via West End → The station has two island platforms and four tracks , like most express stations , but has an unusual track arrangement .
The uptown side has the traditional arrangement of local service on the outside track and express service on the inside track , but the downtown side reverses this ( local on the inside , express on the outside ) .
This is to avoid level junctions with the IND Queens Boulevard Line , which is perpendicular with the IND Sixth Avenue Line north of this station .
Express trains come from the Bronx via a connection from the IND Eighth Avenue Line while local trains come from Queens via either the IND 63rd Street Line or the 53rd Street Tunnels .
South of this station , the downtown local track crosses under the express track and the line returns to the traditional arrangement in both directions at 42nd Street – Bryant Park .
Each platform has seven stairs to mezzanine , the north end of the northbound platform has an active tower , and is depressed about ten feet below the southbound platform .
This is to prepare the lines to be branched out towards the Bronx and Queens .
The color band is Permanent Red , with Chocolate Brown borders , " 47 " and " 50 " alternate each other below the tile band .
The tiles above and below it are white .
Also at this station , there is a sign next to the tower saying " What you punch is what you get " ; this sign is referring to the automatic punch boxes on both tracks on the northbound platform .
In the case of an emergency or service reroute , the express tracks can also be used to access the 63rd Street tunnel .
