NOMENCLATURE Section::::Nomenclature .
The misleading name " pepper " was given by Europeans when Christopher Columbus brought the plant back to Europe .
At that time , black pepper ( peppercorns ) , from the unrelated plant Piper nigrum originating from India , was a highly prized condiment ; the name " pepper " was at that time applied in Europe to all known spices with a hot and pungent taste and was therefore naturally extended to the newly discovered genus Capsicum .
The most commonly used alternative name of the plant family , " chile " , is of Mexican origin , from the Nahuatl word chilli .
Botanically speaking , bell peppers are fruits ; however , they are considered vegetables in culinary contexts .
The bell pepper is the only member of the genus Capsicum that does not produce capsaicin , a lipophilic chemical that can cause a strong burning sensation when it comes in contact with mucous membranes .
The lack of capsaicin in bell peppers is due to a recessive form of a gene that eliminates capsaicin and , consequently , the " hot " taste usually associated with the rest of the genus Capsicum .
This recessive gene is overwritten in the Mexibelle pepper , a hybrid variety of bell pepper that produces small amounts of capsaicin ( and is thus mildly pungent ) .
Sweet pepper cultivars produce non - pungent capsaicinoids .
The terms " bell pepper " ( US , Canada ) , " pepper " or " sweet pepper " ( UK ) , and " capsicum " ( Australia , India , New Zealand and Pakistan ) are often used for any of the large bell - shaped peppers , regardless of their color .
The vegetable is simply referred to as a " pepper " , or additionally by color ( " green pepper " or red , yellow , orange , purple , brown , black ) .
In the Midland region of the U.S. , bell peppers when stuffed and pickled are sometimes called " mangoes . "
Canadian English uses both " bell pepper " and " pepper " interchangeably .
In some languages , the term " paprika " , which has its roots in the word for pepper , is used for both the spice and the fruit – sometimes referred to by their colour ( e.g. , " groene paprika " , " gele paprika " , in Dutch , which are green and yellow , respectively ) .
The bell pepper is called " パプリカ " ( papurika ) or " ピーマン " ( piiman , from Portuguese pimentão ) in Japan .
In Switzerland , the fruit is mostly called " peperone " , which is the Italian name of the fruit .
In France , it is called " poivron " , with the same root as " poivre " ( meaning " pepper " ) or " piment " .
In Spain it is called " pimiento " , which would be the masculine form of the traditional spice , " pimienta " .
In South Korea , the word " 피망 "
( pimang from the Japanese " ピーマン " ( piiman ) ) refers to green bell peppers , whereas " 파프리카 " ( papeurika from paprika ) refers to bell peppers of other colors .
In Sri Lanka , the fruit used as a vegetable is called " maalu miris " .
COLORS Section::::Colors .
The most common colors of bell peppers are green , yellow , orange and red .
More rarely , brown , white , lavender , and dark purple peppers can be seen , depending on the variety .
Most typically , unripe fruits are green or , less commonly , pale yellow or purple .
Red bell peppers are simply ripened green peppers , although the Permagreen variety maintains its green color even when fully ripe .
As such , mixed colored peppers also exist during parts of the ripening process .
Green peppers are less sweet and slightly more bitter than yellow or orange peppers , with red bell peppers being the sweetest .
The taste of ripe peppers can also vary with growing conditions and post - harvest storage treatment ; the sweetest fruits are allowed to ripen fully on the plant in full sunshine , while fruit harvested green and after - ripened in storage is less sweet .
