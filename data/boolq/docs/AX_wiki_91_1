LIST OF MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL FRANCHISE POSTSEASON DROUGHTS Throughout the history of Major League Baseball ( MLB )
, franchises have had various postseason and World Series droughts .
All 16 of the original Major League franchises ( i.e. , those in place when the first World Series was played in 1903 ) have won the World Series , with the longest wait for a franchise 's first championship being for the Phillies ( years , ending in 1980 ) .
Since expansion began in 1961 , seven of the 14 expansion teams have never won the World Series .
Further , one franchise ( the Indians ) has a current championship drought that pre - dates the expansion era .
The three longest championship droughts in history were ended recently by the Red Sox ( years , ending in 2004 ) , the White Sox ( years , ending in 2005 ) , and the Cubs ( years , ending in 2016 ) .
Discounting the years in which there was no MLB franchise in Washington , there have been seasons played in Washington since their last World Series championship ( in 1924 ) .
Only two expansion franchises ( the Expos / Nationals and the Mariners ) have never won a pennant ( i.e. , the league championship , the two winners of which meet in the World Series ) .
The two longest pennant droughts in history were recently ended by the Rangers ( years , starting with the team 's foundation , ending in 2010 ) and the Cubs ( years , ending in 2016 ) .
The Expos / Nationals pennant drought includes years in Montreal , which no longer hosts a team , and years since the move to Washington ; discounting the years in which there was no MLB franchise in Washington , there have been seasons played in Washington since their last pennant ( in 1933 ) .
Every MLB franchise has at least been to the postseason , especially since expansion of the playoffs in 1994 made that feat easier .
The Mariners have the longest active postseason drought at years .
Long postseason droughts were ended recently by the Nationals ( years for the franchise , seasons over years for the city , ending in 2012 ) , the Pirates ( years , ending in 2013 ) , the Royals ( years , ending in 2014 ) , and the Blue Jays ( years , ending in 2015 ) .
