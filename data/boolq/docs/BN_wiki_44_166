The Envoy was also offered with an extended wheelbase to increase accommodation of more cargo and/or passengers .
The Envoy XL was the full - size counterpart to the five - passenger mid - size Envoy .
One unique element of the Envoy XL was the availability of a usable third row that was comfortable for a passenger .
This vehicle is 16 in ( 406 mm ) longer and has a higher roofline to allow easier access to the third row of seats .
This roof is disguised by standard roof racks .

2004
Section::::2004 .
Not many changes were made to any of the models this year .
The only changes included the added feature of optional adjustable pedals , optional XM Satellite Radio , and an optional DVD - based navigation system .
XUV
Section::::XUV .
The five - passenger Envoy XUV , introduced for 2004 , was an attempt to create a combination of pickup truck and SUV .
It featured a retractable rear roof section that slid forward , giving an open - topped load area .
A ' MidGate ' could be raised to partition the load area off from the passenger compartment ; this was a solid , waist - height plastic - lined panel and with a retractable glass partition for the top half .
The two - way tailgate could either hinge sideways or drop down ; the tailgate glass retracted into the solid tailgate .
The cargo area was waterproofed and fitted with a drainage system , allowing it to be easily hosed down for cleaning .
The advantage of the Envoy XUV over a pickup truck or a more truck - like configuration such as the Chevrolet Avalanche ( which originated the MidGate feature ) is that with retractable roof and rear glass closed , the cargo area is sealed , full roof height and lockable , thus making it an enclosed SUV .
The disadvantages include a much shorter cargo bed area and breakable side glass .
The Envoy XUV 's retractable roof was reminiscent of the Studebaker Wagonaire of the 1960s , while other features such as the ' MidGate ' were similar to those of the GMC Terracross concept SUV .
2005
Section::::2005 .
In 2005 , a Denali luxury version of the Envoy became available .
Both the standard - length wheelbase Envoy as well as the Envoy XL were available with the Denali trim option .

It also featured the GM Vortec 5.3 liter V8 engine with " Displacement on Demand , " shutting off four of the eight cylinders when workload was minimal .
Prices for the Envoy Denali ranged from US$ 37,145 to $ 42,750 ; prices for the Envoy XL Denali ranged from $ 38,575 to $ 43,895 .
Across the range , seating was restyled in hopes to increase comfort and quality of control of driving position .
Additionally , a touch DVD navigation system was offered as an option .
The option of side airbags evolved from previously just front - seat side - impact airbags to full - length side curtain airbags , covering both rows of seats ( in the XL model , all three rows ) .
Envoy XUV sales , projected at 30,000 per year ( approximately a third of Envoy production ) , were much slower with just over 12,000 sold in 2004 .
GM discontinued XUV production on March 15 , 2005 .

Section::::2006 .
For 2006 , GMC added standard stability control , called " Stabilitrak , " as well as standard cruise control , OnStar , and a tire pressure monitoring system .
