24-HOUR RUN
A 24-hour run is a form of ultramarathon , in which a competitor runs as far as they can in 24 hours .
They are typically held on 1- to 2-mile loops or occasionally 400-meter tracks .
Top runners will often run or more , depending on conditions , and the best can go beyond .
Some participants will have a crew to help them , but others just set up a camp with all the gear and supplies they need near the starting area to access each loop .
Often 24-hour events are combined with 6- , 12- , and 48-hour events .
24-hour runs have also been held in relay formats , with runners completing a mile each in succession for 24 hours .
Often these events are not internationally sanctioned , and are more for charitable purposes .
The world records for the event on all surfaces are 262.19 km ( 162.919 miles ) for women , set by Camille Herron of USA in 2018 , and 303.506 km ( 188.590 miles ) for men , set by Yiannis Kouros in 1997 .
