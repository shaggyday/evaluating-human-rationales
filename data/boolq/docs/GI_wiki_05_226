FALLOPIAN TUBE
The fallopian tubes , also known as uterine tubes or salpinges ( singular salpinx ) are uterine appendages , lined from inside with ciliated simple columnar epithelium , leading from the ovaries of female mammals into the uterus , via the uterotubal junction .
They enable the passage of egg cells from the ovaries to the uterus .
In non - mammalian vertebrates , the equivalent structures are called oviducts .
STRUCTURE
Section::::Structure .
Its different segments are ( near the ovaries to near the uterus ) : the infundibulum with its associated fimbriae near the ovary , the ampullary region that represents the major portion of the lateral tube , the isthmus the visible medial third segment which is the narrower part of the tube that links to the uterus , and the interstitial ( also known as intramural ) part that transverses the uterine musculature .
The ostium is the point where the tubal canal meets the peritoneal cavity , while the uterine opening of the fallopian tube is the entrance into the uterine cavity , the uterotubal junction .
MICROANATOMY Section::::Microanatomy .
A cross - section of a fallopian tube shows four distinct layers , from outer to inner : serosa , subserosa , lamina propria and innermost mucosal .
The serosa is derived from visceral peritoneum .
Subserosa is composed of loose adventitious tissue , blood vessels , lymphatics , an outer longitudinal and inner circular smooth muscle coats .
This layer is responsible for the peristaltic action of the fallopian tubes .
Lamina propria is a vascular connective tissue .
The inner layer is a single layer of simple columnar epithelium .
The columnar cells have microscopic hair - like filaments ( cilia ) predominately throughout the tube , but are most numerous in the infundibulum and ampulla .
Estrogen increases the production of cilia on these cells .
Between the ciliated cells are peg cells , which contain apical granules and produce the tubular fluid .
This fluid contains nutrients for spermatozoa , oocytes , and zygotes .
The secretions also promote capacitation of the sperm by removing glycoproteins and other molecules from the plasma membrane of the sperm .
Progesterone increases the number of peg cells , while estrogen increases their height and secretory activity .
Tubal fluid flows against the action of the cilia , that is toward the fimbrial end .
In view of longitudinal variation in histological features of tube , the isthmus has thick muscular coat and simple mucosal folds ; whereas ampulla has complex mucosal folds .
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Development .
Embryos have two pairs of ducts to let gametes out of the body ; one pair ( the MÃ¼llerian ducts ) develops in females into the fallopian tubes , uterus and vagina , while the other pair ( the Wolffian ducts ) develops in males into the epididymis and vas deferens .
Normally , only one of the pairs of tubes will develop while the other regresses and disappears in utero .
The homologous organ in the male is the rudimentary appendix testis .
FUNCTION FERTILIZATION Section::::Function . Section::::Fertilization .
The tube allows passage of the egg from the ovary to the uterus .
When an oocyte is developing in an ovary , it is encapsulated in a spherical collection of cells known as an ovarian follicle .
Just prior to ovulation the primary oocyte completes meiosis
I to form the first polar body and a secondary oocyte which is arrested in metaphase of meiosis II .
This secondary oocyte is then ovulated .
The follicle and the ovary 's wall rupture , allowing the secondary oocyte to escape .
The secondary oocyte is caught by the fimbriated end and travels to the ampulla of the uterine tube where typically the sperm are met and fertilization occurs ; meiosis II is promptly completed .
The fertilized ovum , now a zygote , travels towards the uterus aided by activity of tubal cilia and activity of the tubal muscle .
The early embryo requires critical development in the fallopian tube .
After about five days the new embryo enters the uterine cavity and on about the sixth day implants on the wall of the uterus .
The release of an oocyte does not alternate between the two ovaries and seems to be random .
After removal of an ovary , the remaining one produces an egg every month .
Occasionally the embryo implants into the fallopian tube instead of the uterus , creating an ectopic pregnancy , commonly known as a " tubal pregnancy " .
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
PATENCY TESTING Section::::Clinical significance .
Section::::Patency testing .
While a full testing of tubal functions in patients with infertility is not possible , testing of tubal patency is important as tubal obstruction is a major cause of infertility .
A hysterosalpingogram , laparoscopy and dye , or HyCoSy ( hysterocontrast sonography ) will demonstrate that tubes are open .
Tubal insufflation is a standard procedure for testing patency .
During surgery the condition of the tubes may be inspected and a dye such as methylene blue can be injected into the uterus and shown to pass through the tubes when the cervix is occluded .
As tubal disease is often related to Chlamydia infection , testing for Chlamydia antibodies has become a cost - effective screening device for tubal pathology .
INFLAMMATION
Section::::Inflammation .
Salpingitis is inflammation of the fallopian tubes and may be found alone , or be a component of pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID ) .
A thickening of the fallopian tube at its narrow portion , due to inflammation , is known as salpingitis isthmica nodosa .
Like PID and endometriosis , it may lead to fallopian tube obstruction .
Fallopian tube obstruction is associated with infertility and ectopic pregnancy .
CANCER Section::::Cancer .
Fallopian tube cancer , which typically arises from the epithelial lining of the fallopian tube , has historically been considered to be a very rare malignancy .
Recent evidence suggests it probably represents a significant portion of what has been classified as ovarian cancer in the past .
While tubal cancers may be misdiagnosed as ovarian cancer , it is of little consequence as the treatment of both ovarian and fallopian tube cancer is similar .
SURGERY Section::::Surgery .
The surgical removal of a fallopian tube is called a salpingectomy .
To remove both tubes is a bilateral salpingectomy .
An operation that combines the removal of a fallopian tube with removal of at least one ovary is a salpingo - oophorectomy .
An operation to remove a fallopian tube obstruction is called a tuboplasty .
OTHER Section::::Other .
The fallopian tube can prolapse into the vagina and can be mistaken for a tumour .
This usually happens after a hysterectomy .
HISTORY Section::::History .
They are named after their discoverer , the 16th century Italian anatomist Gabriele Falloppio , who thought they resembled tubas , the plural of ' in Italian being ' .
Though the name Fallopian tube is eponymous , it is often spelt with a lower case f from the assumption that the adjective fallopian has been absorbed into modern English as the name for the structure .
