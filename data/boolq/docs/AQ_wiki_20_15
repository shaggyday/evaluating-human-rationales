HISTORY EARLY YEARS ( 1900–1965 ) Section::::History .
Section::::Early years ( 1900–1965 ) .
FC Bayern Munich was founded by members of a Munich gymnastics club ( MTV 1879 ) .
When a congregation of members of MTV 1879 decided on 27 February 1900 that the footballers of the club would not be allowed to join the German Football Association ( DFB ) , 11 members of the football division left the congregation and on the same evening founded Fußball - Club Bayern München .
Within a few months , Bayern achieved high - scoring victories against all local rivals , including a 15–0 win against FC Nordstern , and reached the semi - finals of the 1900–01 South German championship .
In the following years , the club won some local trophies and in 1910–11 Bayern joined the newly founded " Kreisliga " , the first regional Bavarian league .
The club won this league in its first year , but did not win it again until the beginning of World War I in 1914 , which halted all football activities in Germany .
In the years after the war , Bayern won several regional competitions before winning its first South German championship in 1926 , an achievement repeated two years later .
Its first national title was gained in 1932 , when coach Richard " Little Dombi " Kohn led the team to the German championship by defeating Eintracht Frankfurt 2–0 in the final .
The advent of Nazism put an abrupt end to Bayern 's development .
Club president Kurt Landauer and the coach , both of whom were Jewish , left the country .
Many others in the club were also purged .
Bayern was taunted as the " Jew 's club " , while local rival 1860 Munich gained much support .
Josef Sauter , who was inaugurated 1943 , was the only NSDAP member as president .
As some Bayern players greeted Landauer , who was watching a friendly in Switzerland lead to continued discrimination .
Bayern was also affected by the ruling that football players had to be full amateurs again .
In the following years , Bayern could not sustain its role of contender for the national title , achieving mid - table results in its regional league instead .
After the war , Bayern became a member of the Oberliga Süd , the southern conference of the German first division , which was split five ways at that time .
Bayern struggled , hiring and firing 13 coaches between 1945 and 1963 .
Landauer returned from exile in 1947 and was once again appointed club president , the tenure lasted until 1951 .
He remains as the club 's president with the longest accumulated tenure .
Landauer has been deemed as inventor of Bayern as a professional club and his memory is being upheld by the Bayern ultras Schickeria .
In 1955 , the club was relegated but returned to the Oberliga in the following season and won the DFB - Pokal for the first time , beating Fortuna Düsseldorf 1–0 in the final .
The club struggled financially though , verging on bankruptcy at the end of the 1950s .
Manufacturer Roland Endler provided the necessary funds and was rewarded with four years at the helm of the club .
In 1963 , the Oberligas in Germany were consolidated into one national league , the Bundesliga .
Five teams from the Oberliga South were admitted .
Bayern finished third in that year 's southern division , but another Munich team , 1860 Munich , had won the championship .
As the DFB preferred not to include two teams from one city , Bayern was not chosen for the Bundesliga .
They gained promotion two years later , fielding a team with young talents like Franz Beckenbauer , Gerd Müller and Sepp Maier — who would later be collectively referred to as the axis .
THE GOLDEN YEARS ( 1965–1979 )
Section::::The golden years
( 1965–1979 ) .
In their first Bundesliga season , Bayern finished third and also won the DFB - Pokal .
This qualified them for the following year 's European Cup Winners ' Cup , which they won in a dramatic final against Scottish club Rangers , when Franz Roth scored the decider in a 1–0 extra time victory .
In 1967 , Bayern retained the DFB - Pokal , but slow overall progress saw Branko Zebec take over as coach .
He replaced Bayern 's offensive style of play with a more disciplined approach , and in doing so achieved the first league and cup double in Bundesliga history in 1969 .
Bayern Munich are one of four German clubs to win the Bundesliga and DFB - Pokal in the same season along with Borussia Dortmund , 1 .
FC Köln and Werder Bremen .
Zebec used only 13 players throughout the season .
Udo Lattek took charge in 1970 .
After winning the DFB - Pokal in his first season , Lattek led Bayern to their third German championship .
The deciding match in the 1971–72 season against Schalke 04 was the first match in the new Olympiastadion , and was also the first live televised match in Bundesliga history .
Bayern beat Schalke 5–1 and thus claimed the title , also setting several records , including points gained and goals scored .
Bayern also won the next two championships , but the zenith was their triumph in the 1974 European Cup Final against Atlético Madrid , which Bayern won 4–0 after a replay .
This title – after winning the Cup Winners ' trophy 1967 and two semi - finals ( 1968 and 1972 ) in that competition – marked the club 's breakthrough as a force on the international stage .
During the following years , the team was unsuccessful domestically but defended their European title by defeating Leeds United in the 1975 European Cup Final when Roth and Müller secured victory with late goals .
" We came back into the game and scored two lucky goals , so in the end , we were the winners but we were very , very lucky " , stated Franz Beckenbauer .
Billy Bremner believed the French referee was " very suspicious " .
Leeds fans then rioted in Paris and were banned from European football for three years .
A year later in Glasgow , Saint - Étienne were defeated by another Roth goal and Bayern
became the third club to win the trophy in three consecutive years .
The final trophy won by Bayern in this era was the Intercontinental Cup , in which they defeated Brazilian club Cruzeiro over two legs .
The rest of the decade was a time of change and saw no further titles for Bayern .
In 1977 , Franz Beckenbauer left for New York Cosmos and , in 1979 , Sepp Maier and Uli Hoeneß retired while Gerd Müller joined the Fort Lauderdale Strikers .
Bayerndusel was coined during this period as an expression of either contempt or envy about the sometimes narrow and last - minute wins against other teams .
FROM FC BREITNIGGE TO FC HOLLYWOOD ( 1979–1998 ) Section::::From
FC Breitnigge to FC Hollywood ( 1979–1998 ) .
The 1980s were a period of off - field turmoil for Bayern , with many changes in personnel and financial problems .
On the field , Paul Breitner and Karl - Heinz Rummenigge , termed FC Breitnigge , led the team to Bundesliga titles in 1980 and 1981 .
Apart from a DFB - Pokal win in 1982 , two relatively unsuccessful seasons followed , after which Breitner retired and former coach Udo Lattek returned .
Bayern won the DFB - Pokal in 1984 and went on to win five Bundesliga championships in six seasons , including a double in 1986 .
European success , however , was elusive during the decade ; Bayern managed to claim the runners - up spot in the European Cup in 1982 and 1987 .
Jupp Heynckes was hired as coach in 1987 , but after two consecutive championships in 1988–89 and 1989–90 , Bayern 's form dipped .
After finishing second in 1990–91 , the club finished just five points above the relegation places in 1991–92 .
In 1993–94 , Bayern was eliminated in the UEFA Cup second round to Premier League side Norwich City , who remain the only English club to beat Bayern at the Olympiastadion .
Success returned when Franz Beckenbauer took over for the second half of the 1993–94 season , winning the championship again after a four - year gap .
Beckenbauer was then appointed club president .
His successors as coach , Giovanni Trapattoni and Otto Rehhagel , both finished trophyless after a season , not meeting the club 's high expectations .
During this time , Bayern 's players frequently appeared in the gossip pages of the press rather than the sports pages , resulting in the nickname FC Hollywood .
Franz Beckenbauer briefly returned at the end of the 1995–96 season as caretaker coach and led his team to victory in the UEFA Cup , beating Bordeaux in the final .
For the 1996–97 season , Trapattoni returned to win the championship .
In the following season , Bayern lost the title to newly promoted 1 .
FC Kaiserslautern and Trapattoni had to take his leave for the second time .

KITS Section::::Kits .
In the original club constitution , Bayern 's colours were named as white and blue , but the club played in white shirts with black shorts until 1905 , when Bayern joined MSC .
MSC decreed that the footballers would have to play in red shorts .
Also , the younger players were called red shorts , which was meant as an insult .
For most of the club 's early history , Bayern had primarily worn white and maroon home kits .
In 1968–69 season , Bayern changed to red and blue striped shirts , with blue shorts and socks .
Between 1969 and 1973 , the team wore a home strip of red and white striped shirts with either red or white shorts and red socks .
In the 1973–74 season , the team switched to an all - white kit featuring single vertical red and blue stripes on the shirt .
From 1974 onwards , Bayern has mostly worn an all red home kit , with white trim .
Bayern revived the red and blue striped colour scheme between 1995 and 1997 .
In 1997 , blue was the dominant colour for the first time when Adidas released an all navy blue home kit with a red chest band .
In 1999 , Bayern returned to a predominantly red kit , which featured blue sleeves , and in 2000 the club released a traditional all red kit with white trim to be worn for Champions League matches .
Bayern also wore a Rotwein coloured home kits in Bundesliga matches between 2001 and 2003 , and during the 2006–07 Champions League campaign , in reference to their first choice colours prior to the late 1960s .
The club 's away kit has had a wide range of colours over the years , including white , black , blue , and gold - green .
Bayern also features a distinct international kit .
During the 2013–14 season , Bayern used an all red home kit with a Bavarian flag diamond watermark pattern , a Lederhosen inspired white and black Oktoberfest away kit , and an all navy blue international kit .
In the 1980s and 1990s , Bayern used a special away kit when playing at 1 .
FC Kaiserslautern , representing the Brazilian colours blue and yellow , a superstition borne from the fact that the club found it hard to win there .
CREST
Section::::Crest .
Bayern 's crest has changed several times .
Originally it consisted of the stylised letters F , C , B , M , which were woven into one symbol .
The original crest was blue .
The colours of Bavaria were included for the first time in 1954 .
The crest from 1906 to 1919 denotes " Bayern FA " , whereby " FA " stands for Fußball - Abteilung , i.e. Football Department ; Bayern then was integrated into TSV Jahn Munich and constituted its football department .
The modern version of the crest has changed from the 1954 version in several steps .
While the crest consisted of a single colour only for most of the time , namely blue or red , the current crest is blue , red , and white .
It has the colours of Bavaria in its centre and FC Bayern München is written in white on a red ring enclosing the Bavarian colours .
STADIUMS Section::::Stadiums .
Bayern played its first training games at the Schyrenplatz in the centre of Munich .
The first official games were held on the Theresienwiese .
In 1901 , Bayern moved to a field of its own , located in Schwabing at the Clemensstraße .
After joining the Münchner Sport - Club ( MSC ) in 1906 , Bayern moved in May 1907 to MSC 's ground at the Leopoldstraße .
As the crowds gathering for Bayern 's home games increased at the beginning of the 1920s , Bayern had to switch to various other premises in Munich .
From 1925 , Bayern shared the Grünwalder Stadion with 1860 Munich .
Until World War II , the stadium was owned by 1860 Munich , and is still colloquially known as Sechz'ger
( " Sixties " ) Stadium .
It was destroyed during the war , and efforts to rebuild it resulted in a patchwork .
Bayern 's record crowd at the Grünwalder Stadion is reported as more than 50,000 in the home game against 1 .
FC Nürnberg in the 1961–62 season .
In the Bundesliga era the stadium had a maximum capacity of 44,000 which was reached on several occasions , but the capacity has since been reduced to 21,272 .
As was the case at most of this period 's stadiums , the vast majority of the stadium was given over to terracing .
Today the second teams of both clubs play in the stadium .
For the 1972 Summer Olympics the city of Munich built the Olympiastadion .
The stadium , renowned for its architecture , was inaugurated in the last Bundesliga match of the 1971–72 season .
The match drew a capacity crowd of 79,000 , a total which was reached again on numerous occasions .
The stadium was , in its early days , considered to be one of the foremost stadiums in the world and played host to numerous major finals , such as that of 1974 FIFA World Cup .
In the following years the stadium underwent several modifications , such as an increase in seating space from approximately 50 % to ca .
66 % .
Eventually , the stadium had a capacity of 63,000 for national matches and 59,000 for international occasions such as European Cup competitions .
Many people , however , began to feel that the stadium was too cold in winter , with half the audience exposed to the weather due to lack of cover .
A further complaint was the distance between the spectators and the pitch , betraying the stadium 's track and field heritage .
Renovation proved impossible , as the architect Günther Behnisch vetoed major modifications of the stadium .
After much discussion , the city of Munich , the state of Bavaria , Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich jointly decided at the end of 2000 to build a new stadium .
While Bayern had wanted a purpose - built football stadium for several years , the awarding of the 2006 FIFA World Cup to Germany stimulated the discussion as the Olympiastadion no longer met the FIFA criteria to host a World Cup game .
Located on the northern outskirts of Munich , the Allianz Arena has been in use since the beginning of the 2005–06 season .
Its initial capacity of 66,000 fully covered seats has since been increased for matches on national level to 69,901 by transforming 3,000 seats to terracing in a 2:1 ratio .
Since August 2012 , 2,000 more seats were added in the last row of the top tier increasing the capacity to 71,000 .
In January 2015 , a proposal to increase the capacity was approved by the city council so now Allianz Arena has a capacity of 75,000 ( 70,000 in Champions League ) .
The most prominent feature of the stadium is the translucent outer layer , which can be illuminated in different colours for impressive effects .
Red lighting is used for Bayern home games and white for German national team home games .
In May 2012 , Bayern opened a museum about its history , FC Bayern Erlebniswelt , inside the Allianz Arena .

RIVALRIES Section::::Rivalries .
Bayern is one of three professional football clubs in Munich .
Bayern 's main local rival is 1860 Munich , who was the more successful club in the 1960s , winning a cup and a championship .
In the 1970s and 1980s , 1860 Munich moved between the first and the third division .
The Munich derby is still a much - anticipated event , getting a lot of extra attention from supporters of both clubs .
1860
Munich is considered more working - class , and therefore suffers from a diminishing fan base in a city where the manufacturing sector is declining .
Bayern is considered the establishment club , which is reflected by many board members being business leaders and including the former Bavarian minister president , Edmund Stoiber .
Despite the rivalry , Bayern has repeatedly supported 1860 in times of financial disarray .
Since the 1920s , 1 .
FC Nürnberg has been Bayern 's main and traditional rival in Bavaria .
Philipp Lahm said that playing Nürnberg is " always special " and is a " heated atmosphere " .
Both clubs played in the same league in the mid-1920s , but in the 1920s and 1930s , Nürnberg was far more successful , winning five championships in the 1920s , making the club Germany 's record champion .
Bayern took over the title more than sixty years later , when they won their tenth championship in 1987 , thereby surpassing the number of championships won by Nürnberg .
The duel between Bayern and Nürnberg is often referred to as the Bavarian Derby .
Bayern also enjoys a strong rivalry with the 1 .
FC Kaiserslautern , originating in parts from a game in 1973 , when Bayern lost 7–4 after leading 4–1 , but also from the two clubs competing for German championship honours at various times in the Bundesliga as well as the city of Kaiserslautern together with the surrounding Palatinate having been part of Bavaria until a plebiscite after the end of the Second World War .
Since the 1970s , Bayern 's main rivals have been the clubs who put up the strongest fight against its national dominance .
In the 1970s this was Borussia Mönchengladbach , in the 1980s the category expanded to include Hamburger SV .
In the 1990s , Borussia Dortmund , Werder Bremen and Bayer Leverkusen emerged as the most ardent opponents .
Recently Borussia Dortmund , Schalke , and Werder Bremen have been the main challengers in the Bundesliga .
Recently , Bayern 's main Bundesliga challenger has been Borussia Dortmund .
Bayern and Dortmund have competed against each other for many Bundesliga titles .
They also have played against each other in the DFB - Pokal final in 2008 , 2012 , 2014 , and 2016 .
The 2–5 loss against Dortmund in the 2012 final was Bayern 's worst ever loss in a DFB - Pokal final .

SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT AND CHARITY Section::::Social engagement and charity .
Bayern has been involved with charitable ventures for a long time , helping other football clubs in financial disarray as well as ordinary people in misery .
In the wake of the 2004 Tsunami the " FC Bayern – Hilfe e .
V. " was founded , a foundation that aims to concentrate the social engagements of the club .
At its inception this venture was funded with € 600,000 , raised by officials and players of the club .
The money was amongst other things used to build a school in Marathenkerny , Sri Lanka and to rebuild the area of Trincomalee , Sri Lanka .
In April 2007 it was decided that the focus of the foundation would shift towards supporting people in need locally .
The club has also time and again shown to have a soft spot for clubs in financial disarray .
Repeatedly the club has supported its local rival 1860 Munich with gratuitous friendlies , transfers at favourable rates , and direct money transfers .
Also when St. Pauli threatened to lose its license for professional football due to financial problems , Bayern met the club for a friendly game free of any charge , giving all revenues to St. Pauli .
More recently when Mark van Bommel 's home club Fortuna Sittard was in financial distress Bayern came to a charity game at the Dutch club .
Another well known example was the transfer of Alexander Zickler in 1993 from Dynamo Dresden .
When Bayern picked up Zickler for 2.3 Million DM many considered the sum to be a subvention for the financially threatened Dresdeners .
In 2003 , Bayern provided a 2 Million Euro loan without collateral to the nearly bankrupt Borussia Dortmund which has since been repaid .
On 14 July 2013 , Bayern played a charity game against financially threatened third division Hansa Rostock .
The game raised about € 1 million , securing Hansa 's licence .
On 30 August 2017 , Bayern played a benefit match against financial troubled Kickers Offenbach .
All the revenue from the match went to Kickers Offenbach .
Bayern 's Chairmann , Karl - Heinz Rummenigge said , " Kickers Offenbach are a club with a rich tradition , they 've always been an important club in Germany , so we 'll gladly help them with a benefit match . "

In 2006 Bayern purchased land near the Allianz Arena with the purpose of building a new youth academy .
In 2015 the project , estimated to cost € 70 million , was started , after overcoming internal resistance .
The main reasons for the project were that the existing facilities were too small and that the club , while very successful at senior level , lacked competitiveness with other German and European clubs at youth level .
The new facility is scheduled to open in the 2017–18 season .
On 21 August 2017 the FC Bayern Campus opened at a cost of € 70 million .
