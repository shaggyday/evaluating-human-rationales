FA CUP SEMI - FINALS
The FA Cup semi - finals are played to determine which teams will contest the FA Cup Final .
They are the penultimate phase of the FA Cup , the oldest football tournament in the world .
LOCATION Section::::Location .
The semi - finals have always been contested at neutral venues .
Since 2008 , all semi - finals have been held at Wembley .
In the past any suitably large ground which was not the home ground of a teams in that semi - final was used .
Villa Park in Birmingham , Old Trafford in Manchester , and Hillsborough in Sheffield were common hosts .
All semi - finals between 1871 and 1881 were played at Kensington Oval .
The first neutral semi - final match outside of London took place in 1882 in Huddersfield .
The 1989 semi - final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough , Sheffield , turned into tragedy when 96 supporters were killed in the stands due to overcrowding .
The Hillsborough disaster had wide - ranging effects on future stadium design .
Liverpool were granted special dispensation to avoid playing their 2012 semifinal match against Everton on day 23rd anniversary of the disaster .
The 1991 semi - final between Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur was the first to be played at Wembley , the traditional venue for the FA Cup Final .
Two years later both semi - finals were held at Wembley after the Steel City derby between Sheffield clubs Wednesday
and United was switched from the original venue of Elland Road , Leeds .
This was repeated in 1994 , although a replay between Manchester United and Oldham Athletic was held at Maine Road , Manchester .
From 1995 to 1999 and from 2001 to 2004 other neutral grounds were used , though in 2000 both matches were played at the old Wembley , in its final year of operation .
In 2005 both semi - finals were played at the Millennium Stadium , Cardiff .
However , in 2006 the FA decided to revert to the neutral ground system , with Villa Park and Old Trafford hosting the games .
In 2003 , it was announced that all future semi - finals would be played at the new Wembley Stadium , once it had opened ; this took effect in 2008 .
The decision was mainly for financial reasons , to allow the FA to recoup some of the costs of rebuilding the stadium .
However , the move was to the disappointment of traditionalists and drew criticism from some supporters ' groups .
Over a decade after the move , Aston Villa ( amongst others ) have called to regionalise the semifinals once again .
Tottenham Hotspur 's 2018 semifinal was to some extant a home match , as that season they used Wembley while their new stadium was under construction .
However for the semifinal the FA treated them as a neutral team rather than a home team .
FORMAT Section::::Format .
In the past a replay match was played if the first semi - final ended in a draw .
If the replay match also ended in a draw a second replay match would take place .
In theory , an unlimited number of games could be played to determine the outcome of a tie .
For example , in 1980 it took four games to decide the winner between Arsenal and Liverpool .
This is the most games needed to settle an FA Cup Semi - final , although there were several occasions where three games were played .
Prior to the 1992 semi - finals , the only semi - final played under different rules to this was the rearranged 1989 semi - final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest , for which it had been declared in advance that the game would be decided by extra - time and penalties if necessary due to the Hillsborough Stadium disaster .
Queen 's Park chose not to contest the 1871–72 replay match with Wanderers .
There were no semi - finals played in the 1872–73 competition .
Under the rules at the time , holders Wanderers received a bye to the final .
Queen 's Park again decided not to contest a semifinal , so Oxford University advanced automatically .
Between 1877–1881 only one semi - final was played due to the format of the competition leaving three teams remaining .
In 1991 the FA decided that only one replay should be played ( starting with the 1991–92 competition ) .
If this game ended in a draw , extra time would be played , followed by penalty kicks if the match was still even .
In 1999 it was decided that the semi - finals should be decided in one game , with extra time and penalties used to determine the outcome if the game ended in a draw .
Replays are still used in earlier rounds , however , though were eliminated in the quarter - finals in 2016 .
The last FA Cup Semi - final replay , in 1999 , saw Manchester United take on Arsenal at Villa Park .
This turned out to become one of the most memorable semi - finals of all time , with Peter Schmeichel saving a last - minute penalty from Dennis Bergkamp and a Ryan Giggs extra time goal deciding the outcome in Manchester United 's favour .
In 2003 this goal was voted the greatest ever in FA Cup history .
In 2016 - 17 and onwards , a fourth substitute was allowed in semifinal matches if the game went into extra time .
RECORDS Section::::Records .
Villa Park is the most used stadium in FA Cup semi – final history , having hosted 55 semi – finals .
The highest attendance for an FA Cup semi - final is 88,141 for Everton 's penalty win over Manchester United on 19 April 2009 .
It was the fourth semi - final to be played at the new Wembley Stadium .
The highest winning margin was Newcastle United 's 6–0 victory over Fulham in the 1908 Anfield semi - final .
The highest post - war winning margin was Stoke City 's 5–0 victory over Bolton Wanderers in the second 2011 semi - final on 17 April 2011 .
The highest - scoring match was Hull City 's 5–3 victory over Sheffield United in the second 2014 semi - final .
