Gorilla Tape is a brand of adhesive tape sold by Sharonville , Ohio based Gorilla Glue Inc. Introduced in late 2005 , Gorilla Tape is a reinforced form of duct tape and was featured in Popular Sciences " Best of What 's New 2006 " .
Gorilla Tape is available in several sizes and colors , including camouflage , white and clear .
COMPOSITION Section::::Composition .
Gorilla Tape incorporates a three - layer construction : a weather - resistant outer shell , reinforced fabric backing , and an adhesive layer that is applied twice as thick as the adhesive found on duct tape , which Popular Science says allows it to better surround and grip uneven surfaces .
To prevent premature tearing , the two layers of fabric backing are slightly offset , making the tape 145 % stronger than duct tape , while still allowing it to be torn by hand .
REACTION
Section::::Reaction .
Stephen Regenold , reviewing the product for Gear Junkie , stated that in his tests of the product , it performed as promised , sticking to nearly any type of surface to which he applied it , including a tear on a down jacket , and that the Gorilla Tape held onto the jacket without stretching or any compromise , and managed to keep the insulation from escaping for an entire winter of skiing and hiking .
However , while Regenold stated that Gorilla Tape was ideal for outdoor repairs , its greater thickness and weight makes it suboptimal for things like blister repair , stating that in contrast , duct tape provides , " zero resistance inside a sock " .
Gorilla Tape was featured in Popular Science 's " Best of What 's New 2006 " , which commented on the product , " Oh , what MacGyver could have done with the new Gorilla Tape in place of his beloved gray stuff . "
