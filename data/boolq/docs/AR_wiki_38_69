THE OBSERVER
The Observer is a British newspaper published on Sundays .
In the same place on the political spectrum as its sister papers The Guardian and The Guardian Weekly , whose parent company Guardian Media Group Limited acquired it in 1993 , it takes a social liberal or social democratic line on most issues .
First published in 1791 , it is the world 's oldest Sunday newspaper .

Section::::Origins .
The first issue , published on 4 December 1791 by W.S. Bourne , was the world 's first Sunday newspaper .
Believing that the paper would be a means of wealth , Bourne instead soon found himself facing debts of nearly £ 1,600 .
Though early editions purported editorial independence , Bourne attempted to cut his losses and sell the title to the government .
When this failed , Bourne 's brother ( a wealthy businessman ) made an offer to the government , which also refused to buy the paper but agreed to subsidise it in return for influence over its editorial content .
As a result , the paper soon took a strong line against radicals such as Thomas Paine , Francis Burdett and Joseph Priestley .
NINETEENTH CENTURY Section::::Nineteenth century .
In 1807 , the brothers decided to relinquish editorial control , naming Lewis Doxat as the new editor .
Seven years later , the brothers sold The Observer to William Innell Clement , a newspaper proprietor who owned a number of publications .
The paper continued to receive government subsidies during this period ; in 1819 , of the approximately 23,000 copies of the paper distributed weekly , approximately 10,000 were given away as " specimen copies " , distributed by postmen who were paid to deliver them to " lawyers , doctors , and gentlemen of the town . "
Yet the paper began to demonstrate a more independent editorial stance , criticising the authorities ' handling of the events surrounding the Peterloo Massacre and defying an 1820 court order against publishing details of the trial of the Cato Street Conspirators , who were alleged to have plotted to murder members of the Cabinet .
The woodcut pictures published of the stable and hayloft where the conspirators were arrested reflected a new stage of illustrated journalism that the newspaper pioneered during this time .
Clement maintained ownership of The Observer until his death in 1852 .
During that time , the paper supported parliamentary reform , but opposed a broader franchise and the Chartist leadership .
After Doxat retired in 1857 , Clement 's heirs sold the paper to Joseph Snowe , who also took over the editor 's chair .
Under Snowe , the paper adopted a more liberal political stance , supporting the North during the American Civil War and endorsing universal manhood suffrage in 1866 .
These positions contributed to a decline in circulation during this time .
In 1870 , wealthy businessman Julius Beer bought the paper and appointed Edward Dicey as editor , whose efforts succeeded in reviving circulation .
Though Beer 's son Frederick became the owner upon Julius 's death in 1880 , he had little interest in the newspaper and was content to leave Dicey as editor until 1889 .
Henry Duff Traill took over the editorship after Dicey 's departure , only to be replaced in 1891 by Frederick 's wife , Rachel Beer , of the Sassoon family .
Though circulation declined during her tenure , she remained as editor for thirteen years , combining it in 1893 with the editorship of The Sunday Times , a newspaper that she had also bought .
TWENTIETH CENTURY Section::::Twentieth century .
Upon Frederick 's death in 1901 , the paper was purchased by the newspaper magnate Lord Northcliffe .
After maintaining the existing editorial leadership for a couple of years , in 1908 Northcliffe named James Louis Garvin as editor .
Garvin quickly turned the paper into an organ of political influence , boosting circulation from 5,000 to 40,000 within a year of his arrival as a result .
Yet the revival in the paper 's fortunes masked growing political disagreements between Garvin and Northcliffe .
These disagreements ultimately led Northcliffe to sell the paper to William Waldorf Astor in 1911 , who transferred ownership to his son Waldorf Astor , 2nd Viscount Astor four years later .
During this period , the Astors were content to leave the control of the paper in Garvin 's hands .
Under his editorship circulation reached 200,000 during the interwar years , a figure which Garvin fought to maintain even during the depths of the Great Depression .
Politically the paper pursued an independent Conservative stance , which eventually brought Garvin into conflict with Waldorf 's more liberal son David Astor .
Their conflict contributed to Garvin 's departure as editor in 1942 , after which the paper took the unusual step of declaring itself non - partisan .
Ownership passed to Waldorf 's sons in 1948 , with David taking over as editor .
He remained in the position for 27 years , during which time he turned it into a trust - owned newspaper employing , among others , George Orwell , Paul Jennings and C. A. Lejeune .
Under Astor 's editorship The Observer became the first national newspaper to oppose the government 's 1956 invasion of Suez , a move which cost it many readers .
In 1977 , the Astors sold the ailing newspaper to US oil giant Atlantic Richfield ( now called ARCO ) who sold it to Lonrho plc in 1981 .
It became part of the Guardian Media Group in June 1993 , after a rival bid to acquire it by The Independent was rejected .
In 1990 , Farzad Bazoft , a journalist for The Observer , was executed in Iraq on charges of spying .
In 2003 , The Observer interviewed the Iraqi colonel who had arrested and interrogated Bazoft and who was convinced that Bazoft was not a spy .
TWENTY - FIRST CENTURY Section::::Twenty - first century .
In 2003 the editorial supported the Iraq war stating " Military intervention in the Middle East holds many dangers .
But if we want a lasting peace it may be the only option . "
On 27 February 2005 , The Observer Blog was launched , making The Observer the first newspaper to purposely document its own internal decisions , as well as the first newspaper to release podcasts .
The paper 's regular columnists include Andrew Rawnsley and Nick Cohen .
In addition to the weekly Observer Magazine which is still present every Sunday , for several years each issue of The Observer came with a different free monthly magazine .
These magazines had the titles Observer Sport Monthly , Observer Music Monthly , Observer Woman and Observer Food Monthly .
Content from The Observer is included in The Guardian Weekly for an international readership .
The Observer followed its daily partner The Guardian and converted to ' Berliner ' format on Sunday 8 January 2006 .
The Observer was awarded the National Newspaper of the Year at the British Press Awards 2007 .
Editor Roger Alton stepped down at the end of 2007 and was replaced by his deputy , John Mulholland .
In early 2010 , the paper was restyled .
An article on the paper 's website previewing the new version stated that " The News section , which will incorporate Business and personal finance , will be home to a new section , Seven Days , offering a complete round - up of the previous week 's main news from Britain and around the world , and will also focus on more analysis and comment . "
SUPPLEMENTS AND FEATURES Section::::Supplements and features .
After the paper was rejuvenated in early 2010 , the main paper came with only a small number of supplements – Sport , The Observer Magazine , The New Review and The New York Times International Weekly , an 8-page supplement of articles selected from The New York Times , has been distributed with the paper since 2007 .
Every four weeks the paper includes The Observer Food Monthly magazine , and in September 2013 it launched Observer Tech Monthly , a science and technology section which won the Grand Prix at the 2014 Newspaper Awards .
Previously , the main paper had come with a larger range of supplements including Sport , Business & Media , Review , Escape ( a travel supplement ) , The Observer Magazine and various special interest monthlies , such as Observer Food Monthly , Observer Women monthly which was launched in 2006 , Observer Sport Monthly and The Observer Film Magazine .
