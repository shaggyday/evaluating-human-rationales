BLUE MUD DAUBER
The blue mud dauber ( Chalybion californicum ) is a metallic blue species of mud dauber wasp that is the primary predator of black widow spiders .
Females build their own nests , but occasionally refurbish nests abandoned by other mud dauber wasps , particularly Sceliphron .
It is not normally aggressive .
It is similar in shape and colour to the steel - blue cricket hunter ( Chlorion aerarium ) .
Like other types of wasps , males do not have an ovipositor , therefore can not sting .
