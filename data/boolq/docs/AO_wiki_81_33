DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2 Diabetes mellitus type 2 ( also known as type 2 diabetes ) is a long - term metabolic disorder that is characterized by high blood sugar , insulin resistance , and relative lack of insulin .
Common symptoms include increased thirst , frequent urination , and unexplained weight loss .
Symptoms may also include increased hunger , feeling tired , and sores that do not heal .
Often symptoms come on slowly .
Long - term complications from high blood sugar include heart disease , strokes , diabetic retinopathy which can result in blindness , kidney failure , and poor blood flow in the limbs which may lead to amputations .
The sudden onset of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state may occur ; however , ketoacidosis is uncommon .
Type 2 diabetes primarily occurs as a result of obesity and lack of exercise .
Some people are more genetically at risk than others .
Type 2 diabetes makes up about 90 % of cases of diabetes , with the other 10 % due primarily to diabetes mellitus type 1 and gestational diabetes .
In diabetes mellitus type 1 there is a lower total level of insulin to control blood glucose , due to an autoimmune induced loss of insulin - producing beta cells in the pancreas .
Diagnosis of diabetes is by blood tests such as fasting plasma glucose , oral glucose tolerance test , or glycated hemoglobin ( A1C ) .
Type 2 diabetes is partly preventable by staying a normal weight , exercising regularly , and eating properly .
Treatment involves exercise and dietary changes .
If blood sugar levels are not adequately lowered , the medication metformin is typically recommended .
Many people may eventually also require insulin injections .
In those on insulin , routinely checking blood sugar levels is advised ; however , this may not be needed in those taking pills .
Bariatric surgery often improves diabetes in those who are obese .
Rates of type 2 diabetes have increased markedly since 1960 in parallel with obesity .
As of 2015 there were approximately 392 million people diagnosed with the disease compared to around 30 million in 1985 .
Typically it begins in middle or older age , although rates of type 2 diabetes are increasing in young people .
Type 2 diabetes is associated with a ten - year - shorter life expectancy .
Diabetes was one of the first diseases described .
The importance of insulin in the disease was determined in the 1920s .
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Section::::Signs and symptoms .
The classic symptoms of diabetes are polyuria ( frequent urination ) , polydipsia ( increased thirst ) , polyphagia ( increased hunger ) , and weight loss .
Other symptoms that are commonly present at diagnosis include a history of blurred vision , itchiness , peripheral neuropathy , recurrent vaginal infections , and fatigue .
Many people , however , have no symptoms during the first few years and are diagnosed on routine testing .
A small number of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus can develop a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state ( a condition of very high blood sugar associated with a decreased level of consciousness and low blood pressure ) .
COMPLICATIONS Section::::Complications .
Type 2 diabetes is typically a chronic disease associated with a ten - year - shorter life expectancy .
This is partly due to a number of complications with which it is associated , including : two to four times the risk of cardiovascular disease , including ischemic heart disease and stroke ; a 20-fold increase in lower limb amputations , and increased rates of hospitalizations .
In the developed world , and increasingly elsewhere , type 2 diabetes is the largest cause of nontraumatic blindness and kidney failure .
It has also been associated with an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia through disease processes such as Alzheimer 's disease and vascular dementia .
Other complications include acanthosis nigricans , sexual dysfunction , and frequent infections .
CAUSE Section::::Cause .
The development of type 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors .
While some of these factors are under personal control , such as diet and obesity , other factors are not , such as increasing age , female gender , and genetics .
A lack of sleep has been linked to type 2 diabetes .
This is believed to act through its effect on metabolism .
The nutritional status of a mother during fetal development may also play a role , with one proposed mechanism being that of DNA methylation .
The intestinal bacteria Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus have been connected with type 2 diabetes .
LIFESTYLE Section::::Lifestyle .
Lifestyle factors are important to the development of type 2 diabetes , including obesity and being overweight ( defined by a body mass index of greater than 25 ) , lack of physical activity , poor diet , stress , and urbanization .
Excess body fat is associated with 30 % of cases in those of Chinese and Japanese descent , 60–80 % of cases in those of European and African descent , and 100 % of cases in Pima Indians and Pacific Islanders .
Among those who are not obese , a high waist – hip ratio is often present .
Smoking appears to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus .
Dietary factors also influence the risk of developing type 2 diabetes .
Consumption of sugar - sweetened drinks in excess is associated with an increased risk .
The type of fats in the diet are important , with saturated fats and trans fatty acids increasing the risk , and polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat decreasing the risk .
Eating a lot of white rice appears to play a role in increasing risk .
A lack of exercise is believed to cause 7 % of cases .
Persistent organic pollutants may play a role .
GENETICS Section::::Genetics .
Most cases of diabetes involve many genes , with each being a small contributor to an increased probability of becoming a type 2 diabetic .
If one identical twin has diabetes , the chance of the other developing diabetes within his lifetime is greater than 90 % , while the rate for nonidentical siblings is 25–50 % .
As of 2011 , more than 36 genes had been found that contribute to the risk of type 2 diabetes .
All of these genes together still only account for 10 % of the total heritable component of the disease .
The TCF7L2 allele , for example , increases the risk of developing diabetes by 1.5 times and is the greatest risk of the common genetic variants .
Most of the genes linked to diabetes are involved in beta cell functions .
There are a number of rare cases of diabetes that arise due to an abnormality in a single gene ( known as monogenic forms of diabetes or " other specific types of diabetes " ) .
These include maturity onset diabetes of the young ( MODY ) , Donohue syndrome , and Rabson – Mendenhall syndrome , among others .
Maturity onset diabetes of the young constitute 1–5 % of all cases of diabetes in young people .
MEDICAL CONDITIONS Section::::Medical conditions .
There are a number of medications and other health problems that can predispose to diabetes .
Some of the medications include : glucocorticoids , thiazides , beta blockers , atypical antipsychotics , and statins .
Those who have previously had gestational diabetes are at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes .
Other health problems that are associated include : acromegaly , Cushing 's syndrome , hyperthyroidism , pheochromocytoma , and certain cancers such as glucagonomas .
Testosterone deficiency is also associated with type 2 diabetes .
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Section::::Pathophysiology .
Type 2 diabetes is due to insufficient insulin production from beta cells in the setting of insulin resistance .
Insulin resistance , which is the inability of cells to respond adequately to normal levels of insulin , occurs primarily within the muscles , liver , and fat tissue .
In the liver , insulin normally suppresses glucose release .
However , in the setting of insulin resistance , the liver inappropriately releases glucose into the blood .
The proportion of insulin resistance versus beta cell dysfunction differs among individuals , with some having primarily insulin resistance and only a minor defect in insulin secretion and others with slight insulin resistance and primarily a lack of insulin secretion .
Other potentially important mechanisms associated with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance include : increased breakdown of lipids within fat cells , resistance to and lack of incretin , high glucagon levels in the blood , increased retention of salt and water by the kidneys , and inappropriate regulation of metabolism by the central nervous system .
However , not all people with insulin resistance develop diabetes , since an impairment of insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells is also required .
DIAGNOSIS Section::::Diagnosis .
The World Health Organization definition of diabetes ( both type 1 and type 2 ) is for a single raised glucose reading with symptoms , otherwise raised values on two occasions , of either :
* fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol / l ( 126 mg / dl ) * with a glucose tolerance test , two hours after the oral dose a plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol / l ( 200 mg / dl )
A random blood sugar of greater than 11.1 mmol / l ( 200 mg / dl ) in association with typical symptoms or a glycated hemoglobin ( HbA ) of ≥ 48 mmol / mol ( ≥ 6.5 DCCT % ) is another method of diagnosing diabetes .
In 2009 an International Expert Committee that included representatives of the American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) , the International Diabetes Federation ( IDF ) , and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes ( EASD ) recommended that a threshold of ≥ 48 mmol / mol ( ≥ 6.5 DCCT % ) should be used to diagnose diabetes .
This recommendation was adopted by the American Diabetes Association in 2010 .
Positive tests should be repeated unless the person presents with typical symptoms and blood sugars > 11.1 mmol / l ( > 200 mg / dl ) .
Threshold for diagnosis of diabetes is based on the relationship between results of glucose tolerance tests , fasting glucose or HbA and complications such as retinal problems .
A fasting or random blood sugar is preferred over the glucose tolerance test , as they are more convenient for people .
HbA has the advantages that fasting is not required and results are more stable but has the disadvantage that the test is more costly than measurement of blood glucose .
It is estimated that 20 % of people with diabetes in the United States do not realize that they have the disease .
Diabetes mellitus type 2 is characterized by high blood glucose in the context of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency .
This is in contrast to diabetes mellitus type 1 in which there is an absolute insulin deficiency due to destruction of islet cells in the pancreas and gestational diabetes mellitus that is a new onset of high blood sugars associated with pregnancy .
Type 1 and type 2 diabetes can typically be distinguished based on the presenting circumstances .
If the diagnosis is in doubt antibody testing may be useful to confirm type 1 diabetes and C - peptide levels may be useful to confirm type 2 diabetes , with C - peptide levels normal or high in type 2 diabetes , but low in type 1 diabetes .
SCREENING
Section::::Screening .
No major organization recommends universal screening for diabetes as there is no evidence that such a program improve outcomes .
Screening is recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) in adults without symptoms
whose blood pressure is greater than 135/80 mmHg .
For those whose blood pressure is less , the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against screening .
There is no evidence that it changes the risk of death in this group of people .
They also recommend screening among those who are overweight and between the ages of 40 and 70 .
The World Health Organization recommends testing those groups at high risk and in 2014 the USPSTF is considering a similar recommendation .
High - risk groups in the United States include : those over 45 years old ; those with a first degree relative with diabetes ; some ethnic groups , including Hispanics , African - Americans , and Native - Americans ; a history of gestational diabetes ; polycystic ovary syndrome ; excess weight ; and conditions associated with metabolic syndrome .
The American Diabetes Association recommends screening those who have a BMI over 25 ( in people of Asian descent screening is recommended for a BMI over 23 ) .
PREVENTION Section::::Prevention .
Onset of type 2 diabetes can be delayed or prevented through proper nutrition and regular exercise .
Intensive lifestyle measures may reduce the risk by over half .
The benefit of exercise occurs regardless of the person 's initial weight or subsequent weight loss .
High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of diabetes by about 28 % .
Evidence for the benefit of dietary changes alone , however , is limited , with some evidence for a diet high in green leafy vegetables and some for limiting the intake of sugary drinks .
In those with impaired glucose tolerance , diet and exercise either alone or in combination with metformin or acarbose may decrease the risk of developing diabetes .
Lifestyle interventions are more effective than metformin .
A 2017 review found that , long term , lifestyle changes decreased the risk by 28 % , while medication does not reduce risk after withdrawal .
While low vitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk of diabetes , correcting the levels by supplementing vitamin D3 does not improve that risk .
MANAGEMENT
Section::::Management .
Management of type 2 diabetes focuses on lifestyle interventions , lowering other cardiovascular risk factors , and maintaining blood glucose levels in the normal range .
Self - monitoring of blood glucose for people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes may be used in combination with education , however the benefit of self monitoring in those not using multi - dose insulin is questionable .
In those who do not want to measure blood levels , measuring urine levels may be done .
Managing other cardiovascular risk factors , such as hypertension , high cholesterol , and microalbuminuria , improves a person 's life expectancy .
Decreasing the systolic blood pressure to less than 140 mmHg is associated with a lower risk of death and better outcomes .
Intensive blood pressure management ( less than 130/80 mmHg ) as opposed to standard blood pressure management ( less than 140 - 160 mmHg systolic to 85–100 mmHg diastolic ) results in a slight decrease in stroke risk but no effect on overall risk of death .
Intensive blood sugar lowering ( HbA<6 % ) as opposed to standard blood sugar lowering ( HbA of 7–7.9 % ) does not appear to change mortality .
The goal of treatment is typically an HbA of 7 to 8 % or a fasting glucose of less than 7.2 mmol / L ( 130 mg / dl ) ; however these goals may be changed after professional clinical consultation , taking into account particular risks of hypoglycemia and life expectancy .
Despite guidelines recommending that intensive blood sugar control be based on balancing immediate harms with long - term benefits , many people – for example people with a life expectancy of less than nine years who will not benefit , are over - treated .
It is recommended that all people with type 2 diabetes get regular eye examination .
There is weak evidence suggesting that treating gum disease by scaling and root planing may result in a small short - term improvement in blood sugar levels for people with diabetes .
There is no evidence to suggest that this improvement in blood sugar levels is maintained longer than 4 months .
There is also not enough evidence to determine if medications to treat gum disease are effective at lowering blood sugar levels .
LIFESTYLE Section::::Lifestyle .
A proper diet and exercise are the foundations of diabetic care , with a greater amount of exercise yielding better results .
Exercise improves blood sugar control , decreases body fat content and decreases blood lipid levels , and these effects are evident even without weight loss .
Aerobic exercise leads to a decrease in HbA and improved insulin sensitivity .
Resistance training is also useful and the combination of both types of exercise may be most effective .
A diabetic diet that promotes weight loss is important .
While the best diet type to achieve this is controversial , a low glycemic index diet or low carbohydrate diet has been found to improve blood sugar control .
A very low calorie diet , begun shortly after the onset of type 2 diabetes , can result in remission of the condition .
Vegetarian diets in general have been related to lower diabetes risk , but do not offer advantages compared with diets which allow moderate amounts of animal products .
There is not enough evidence to suggest that cinnamon improves blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes .
Culturally appropriate education may help people with type 2 diabetes control their blood sugar levels , for up to 24 months .
If changes in lifestyle in those with mild diabetes has not resulted in improved blood sugars within six weeks , medications should then be considered .
There is not enough evidence to determine if lifestyle interventions affect mortality in those who already have DM2 .
MEDICATIONS Section::::Medications .
There are several classes of anti - diabetic medications available .
Metformin is generally recommended as a first line treatment as there is some evidence that it decreases mortality ; however , this conclusion is questioned .
Metformin should not be used in those with severe kidney or liver problems .
A second oral agent of another class or insulin may be added if metformin is not sufficient after three months .
Other classes of medications include : sulfonylureas , thiazolidinediones , dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors , SGLT2 inhibitors , and glucagon - like peptide-1 analogs .
As of 2015 there was no significant difference between these agents .
A 2018 review found that SGLT2 inhibitors may be better than glucagon - like peptide-1 analogs or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors .
Rosiglitazone , a thiazolidinedione , has not been found to improve long - term outcomes even though it improves blood sugar levels .
Additionally it is associated with increased rates of heart disease and death .
Angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors ( ACEIs ) prevent kidney disease and improve outcomes in those with diabetes .
The similar medications angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARBs ) do not .
A 2016 review recommended treating to a systolic blood pressure of 140 to 150 mmHg .
Injections of insulin may either be added to oral medication or used alone .
Most people do not initially need insulin .
When it is used , a long - acting formulation is typically added at night , with oral medications being continued .
Doses are then increased to effect ( blood sugar levels being well controlled ) .
When nightly insulin is insufficient , twice daily insulin may achieve better control .
The long acting insulins glargine and detemir are equally safe and effective , and do not appear much better than neutral protamine Hagedorn ( NPH ) insulin , but as they are significantly more expensive , they are not cost effective as of 2010 .
In those who are pregnant insulin is generally the treatment of choice .
Vitamin D supplementation to people with type 2 diabetes may improve markers of insulin resistance and HbA1c .
SURGERY Section::::Surgery .
Weight loss surgery in those who are obese is an effective measure to treat diabetes .
Many are able to maintain normal blood sugar levels with little or no medication following surgery and long - term mortality is decreased .
There however is some short - term mortality risk of less than 1 % from the surgery .
The body mass index cutoffs for when surgery is appropriate are not yet clear .
It is recommended that this option be considered in those who are unable to get both their weight and blood sugar under control .
EPIDEMIOLOGY Section::::Epidemiology .
Globally as of 2015 it was estimated that there were 392 million people with type 2 diabetes making up about 90 % of diabetes cases .
This is equivalent to about 6 % of the world 's population .
Diabetes is common both in the developed and the developing world .
It remains uncommon , however , in the least developed countries .
Women seem to be at a greater risk as do certain ethnic groups , such as South Asians , Pacific Islanders , Latinos , and Native Americans .
This may be due to enhanced sensitivity to a Western lifestyle in certain ethnic groups .
Traditionally considered a disease of adults , type 2 diabetes is increasingly diagnosed in children in parallel with rising obesity rates .
Type 2 diabetes is now diagnosed as frequently as type 1 diabetes in teenagers in the United States .
Rates of diabetes in 1985 were estimated at 30 million , increasing to 135 million in 1995 and 217 million in 2005 .
This increase is believed to be primarily due to the global population aging , a decrease in exercise , and increasing rates of obesity .
The five countries with the greatest number of people with diabetes as of 2000 are India having 31.7 million , China 20.8 million , the United States 17.7 million , Indonesia 8.4 million , and Japan 6.8 million .
It is recognized as a global epidemic by the World Health Organization .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Diabetes is one of the first diseases described with an Egyptian manuscript from c. 1500 BCE mentioning " too great emptying of the urine .
" The first described cases are believed to be of type 1 diabetes .
Indian physicians around the same time identified the disease and classified it as madhumeha or honey urine noting that the urine would attract ants .
The term " diabetes " or " to pass through " was first used in 230 BCE by the Greek Apollonius Of Memphis .
The disease was rare during the time of the Roman empire with Galen commenting that he had only seen two cases during his career .
Type 1 and type
2 diabetes were identified as separate conditions for the first time by the Indian physicians Sushruta and Charaka in 400–500 AD with type 1 associated with youth and type 2 with being overweight .
The term " mellitus " or " from honey " was added by the Briton John Rolle in the late 1700s to separate the condition from diabetes insipidus which is also associated with frequent urination .
Effective treatment was not developed until the early part of the 20th century when the Canadians Frederick Banting and Charles Best discovered insulin in 1921 and 1922 .
This was followed by the development of the long acting NPH insulin in the 1940s .
