OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ACT ( UNITED STATES )
The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 is a US labor law governing the federal law of occupational health and safety in the private sector and federal government in the United States .
It was enacted by Congress in 1970 and was signed by President Richard Nixon on December 29 , 1970 .
Its main goal is to ensure that employers provide employees with an environment free from recognized hazards , such as exposure to toxic chemicals , excessive noise levels , mechanical dangers , heat or cold stress , or unsanitary conditions .
The Act created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) .
The Act can be found in the United States Code at title 29 , chapter 15 .
HISTORY OF FEDERAL WORKPLACE SAFETY LEGISLATION
Section::::History of federal workplace safety legislation .
Efforts by the federal government to ensure workplace health and safety were minimal until the passage of OSHA .
The American system of mass production encouraged the use of machinery , while the statutory regime did nothing to protect workplace safety .
For most employers , it was cheaper to replace a dead or injured worker than it was to introduce safety measures .
Tort law provided little recourse for relief for the survivors of dead workers or for injured employees .
After the Civil War , some improvements were made through the establishment of state railroad and factory commissions , the adoption of new technology ( such as the railway air brake ) , and more widespread availability of life insurance .
But the overall impact of these improvements was minimal .
The first federal safety legislation was enacted in the Progressive period .
In 1893 , Congress passed the Safety Appliance Act , the first federal statute to require safety equipment in the workplace ( the law applied only to railroad equipment , however ) .
In 1910 , in response to a series of highly publicized and deadly mine explosions and collapses , Congress established the United States Bureau of Mines to conduct research into mine safety ( although the Bureau had no authority to regulate mine safety ) .
Backed by trade unions , many states also enacted workers ' compensation laws which discouraged employers from permitting unsafe workplaces .
These laws , as well as the growing power of labor unions and public anger toward poor workplace safety , led to significant reductions in worker accidents for a time .
Industrial production increased significantly in the United States during World War II , and industrial accidents soared .
Winning the war took precedence over safety , and most labor unions were more concerned with maintaining wages in the face of severe inflation than with workplace health and safety .
After the war ended , however , workplace accident rates remained high and began to rise .
In the two years preceding OSHA 's enactment , 14,000 workers died each year from workplace hazards , and another 2 million were disabled or harmed .
Additionally , the " chemical revolution " introduced a vast array of new chemical compounds to the manufacturing environment .
The health effects of these chemicals were poorly understood , and workers received few protections against prolonged or high levels of exposure .
While a few states , such as California and New York , had enacted workplace safety as well as workplace health legislation , most states had not changed their workplace protection laws since the turn of the century .
PASSAGE Section::::Passage .
In the mid-1960s , growing awareness of the environmental impact of many chemicals had led to a politically powerful environmental movement .
Some labor leaders seized on the public 's growing unease over chemicals in the environment , arguing that the effect of these compounds on worker health was even worse than the low - level exposure plants and animals received in the wild .
On January 23 , 1968 , President Lyndon B. Johnson submitted a comprehensive occupational health and safety bill to Congress .
Led by the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers , the legislation was widely opposed by business .
Many labor leaders , including the leadership of the AFL - CIO , supported the legislation , including testifying in support at congressional hearings .
The legislation died in committee .
On April 14 , 1969 , President Richard Nixon introduced two bills into Congress which would have also protected worker health and safety .
The Nixon legislation was much less prescriptive than the Johnson bill , and workplace health and safety regulation would be advisory rather than mandatory .
However , Representative James G. O'Hara and Senator Harrison A. Williams introduced a much stricter bill similar to the Johnson legislation of the year before .
Companion legislation introduced in the House also imposed an all - purpose " general duty " clause on the enforcing agency as well .
With the stricter approach of the Democratic bill apparently favored by a majority of both chambers , and unions now strongly supporting a bill , Republicans introduced a new , competing bill .
The compromise bill established the independent research and standard - setting board favored by Nixon , while creating a new enforcement agency .
The compromise bill also gave the Department of Labor the power to litigate on the enforcement agency 's behalf ( as in the Democratic bill ) .
In November 1970 , both chambers acted : The House passed the Republican compromise bill , while the Senate passed the stricter Democratic bill ( which now included the general duty clause ) .
A conference committee considered the final bill in early December 1970 .
Union leaders pressured members of the conference committee to place the standard - setting function in the Department of Labor rather than an independent board .
In return , unions agreed to let an independent review commission have veto power over enforcement actions .
Unions also agreed to removal of a provision in the legislation which would have let the Secretary of Labor shut down plants or stop manufacturing procedures which put workers in " imminent danger " of harm .
In exchange for a Republican proposal to establish an independent occupational health and safety research agency , Democrats won inclusion of the " general duty " clause and the right for union representatives to accompany a federal inspector during inspections .
The conference committee bill passed both chambers on December 17 , 1970 , and President Nixon signed the bill on December 29 , 1970 .
According to the New York Times , labor and environment activist Tony Mazzocchi was a " principal force behind the legislation " .
The Act went into effect on April 28 , 1971 ( now celebrated as Workers ' Memorial Day by American labor unions ) .
DESCRIPTION Section::::Description .
In passing the Act , Congress declared its intent " to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions and to preserve our human resources . "
The Act created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) , an agency of the Department of Labor .
OSHA was given the authority both to set and enforce workplace health and safety standards .
The Act also created the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission to review enforcement priorities , actions and cases .
The Act also established the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) , an independent research institute in the then Department of Health , Education & Welfare now under - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
The Act defines an employer to be any " person engaged in a business affecting commerce who has employees , but does not include the United States or any state or political subdivision of a State . "
The Act applies to employers as diverse as manufacturers , construction companies , law firms , hospitals , charities , labor unions and private schools .
Churches and other religious organizations are covered if they employ workers for secular purposes .
The Act excludes the self - employed , family farms , workplaces covered by other federal laws ( such as mining , nuclear weapons manufacture , railroads and airlines ) and state and local governments ( unless state law permits otherwise ) .
The Act covers federal agencies and the United States Postal Service .
Section 5 of the Act contains the " general duty clause .
" The " general duty clause " requires employers to 1 ) Maintain conditions or adopt practices reasonably necessary and appropriate to protect workers on the job ; 2 ) Be familiar with and comply with standards applicable to their establishments ; and 3 ) Ensure that employees have and use personal protective equipment when required for safety and health .
OSHA has established regulations for when it may act under the " general duty clause .
" The four criteria are 1 ) There must be a hazard ; 2 ) The hazard must be a recognized hazard ( e.g. , the employer knew or should have known about the hazard , the hazard is obvious , or the hazard is a recognized one within the industry ) ; 3 ) The hazard could cause or is likely to cause serious harm or death ; and 4 )
The hazard must be correctable ( OSHA recognizes not all hazards are correctable ) .
Although theoretically a powerful tool against workplace hazards , it is difficult to meet all four criteria .
Therefore , OSHA has engaged in extensive regulatory rule - making to meet its obligations under the law .
Due to the difficulty of the rule - making process ( which is governed by the Administrative Procedures Act ) , OSHA has focused on basic mechanical and chemical hazards rather than procedures .
Major areas which its standards currently cover are : Toxic substances , harmful physical agents , electrical hazards , fall hazards , hazards associated with trenches and digging , hazardous waste , infectious disease , fire and explosion dangers , dangerous atmospheres , machine hazards , and confined spaces .
Section 8 of the Act covers reporting requirements .
All employers must report to OSHA within eight hours if an employee dies from a work - related incident , or three or more employees are hospitalized as a result of a work - related incident .
Additionally , all fatal on - the - job heart attacks must also be reported .
Section 8 permits OSHA inspectors to enter , inspect and investigate , during regular working hours , any workplace covered by the Act .
Employers must also communicate with employees about hazards in the workplace .
By regulation , OSHA requires that employers keep a record of every non - consumer chemical product used in the workplace .
Detailed technical bulletins called material safety data sheets ( MSDSs ) must be posted and available for employees to read and use to avoid chemical hazards .
OSHA also requires employers to report on every injury or job - related illness requiring medical treatment ( other than first aid ) on OSHA Form 300 , " Log of Work - Related Injuries and Illnesses " ( known as an " OSHA Log " or " Form 300 " ) .
An annual summary is also required and must be posted for three months , and records must be kept for at least five years .
Section 11(c ) of the Act prohibits any employer from discharging , retaliating or discriminating against any employee because the worker has exercised rights under the Act .
These rights include complaining to OSHA and seeking an OSHA inspection , participating in an OSHA inspection , and participating or testifying in any proceeding related to an OSHA inspection .
Section 18 of the Act permits and encourages states to adopt their own occupational safety and health plans , so long as the state standards and enforcement " are or will be at least as effective in providing safe and healthful employment " as the federal OSH Act .
States that have such plans are known as " OSHA States . "
As of 2007 , 22 states and territories operated complete plans and four others had plans that covered only the public sector .
