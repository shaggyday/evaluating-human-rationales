HISTORY Section::::History .
Female participation of most sorts at Indianapolis was discouraged and essentially disallowed throughout the first several decades of competition .
As such , female reporters were not even allowed in the pit area until 1971 .
At the time , journalist Denise McCluggage was notably one of the first to challenge that antiquated norm .
A number of female owners / sponsors participated in some capacity throughout the first several decades , and
off - the - track duties were common .
While not behind the wheel of race cars , women were frequently and routinely performers during the pre - race ceremonies , invited as dignitaries to attend the race , and many were employed by the track , working in the ticket office , motel , and other administrative positions .
The first female owner to win the race was Maude " M.A. " Yagle , who owned the car of 1929 winner Ray Keech .
In 1935 , Amelia Earhart was selected to serve as the " Honorary Referee " , a ceremonial position for a dignitary at the race .
In 1972 , Dolly Cole ( wife of GM executive Ed Cole ) , became what is believed to be the first woman ever to ride in the pace car at the start of the race .
In 1974 , Johnny Rutherford 's wife Betty scored for him in his team 's pit area .
She was perhaps the first driver 's wife to spend the entire race in the pits .
Rutherford won the race , and Betty 's presence drew some media attention , leading many other wives to follow suit in future years .
PIONEERS Section::::Pioneers .
The first female to arrive at Indianapolis looking to qualify was Janet Guthrie in 1976 .
However , she fell short on speed and preparation time .
She was able to pass her rookie test but suffered numerous mechanical problems during the month .
On the final day of time trials , Guthrie was loaned a back - up car owned by A. J. Foyt .
She quickly reached a suitable speed ; however , she did not make an attempt to qualify .
Guthrie returned to Indy and qualified for the first time in 1977 , and made three total starts .
She earned a 9th - place finish in 1978 and later revealed she drove with a broken wrist .
During her career , she received a mixed welcome among the competitors and fans but was mostly viewed in a positive light by the media .
Her experiences were at times frustrating , as setbacks and difficulties ranged from engine troubles to the lack of female restrooms in the garage area at the time .
In the early 1980s , Desiré Wilson became the next woman to try to make the race , but she failed to qualify .
Lyn St. James entered the 1992 race driving for Dick Simon Racing .
Due to a services contract with Ford , St. James was initially relegated to the older , under - powered Cosworth DFX engine , and she had trouble getting up to speed .
Later in the month , the team secured a Chevrolet engine , and St. James recorded a qualifying speed of over 220 mph .
After starting 27th , she finished in 11th place and was named the Rookie of the Year .
Overall , she made seven career starts , qualifying 6th in 1994 .
St. James never managed to finish in the top ten .
In 1997 , she was running 9th with eleven laps to go when she was taken out by another car in a crash .
21ST CENTURY Section::::21st century .
Since 2000 , when two female drivers ( St. James and Sarah Fisher ) started the race , female participation has been growing .
Since that year , at least one woman has started every race , and at least two started every race between 2007 and 2015 .
Since 2001 , seven women ( five of them foreign ) have started the 500 .
Before 2005 , Guthrie held the record for best finish in the race .
That year , Danica Patrick , made her Indianapolis debut , qualifying 4th .
She led 19 laps , finished in 4th place , and was named Rookie of the Year .
In 2008 , she was the first female winner of an IndyCar race when she won at Twin Ring Motegi in Japan .
She bettered her record in 2009 , finishing 3rd , and also led laps in the Centennial Race in 2011 .
As of 2017 , she is also the first female driver to have led laps in the Indianapolis 500 , the Daytona 500 , and the Coca - Cola 600 .
In 2010 , four women ( Patrick , Fisher , Ana Beatriz , and Simona de Silvestro ) started the race , while a fifth ( Milka Duno ) failed to qualify .
Patrick finished 6th , and de Silvestro received the Rookie of the Year award .
Four women also started in 2011 , and three of them finished the race .
Four women qualified for the 2013 500 as well . STARTING COMMAND Section::::Starting command .
Traditionally , the starting command for the race has been " Gentlemen , start your engines ! "
When female drivers are competing , the call has been amended to " Lady and Gentlemen ... " or " Ladies and Gentlemen ...
"
In 1977 , a controversy hovered over the starting command , after Janet Guthrie qualified for the race .
Speedway officials did not want to alter the traditional phrase .
After complaints and consideration , on race morning , Tony Hulman recited the following : DRIVERS Section::::Drivers . !
