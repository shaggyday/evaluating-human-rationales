UNITARY STATE
A unitary state is a state governed as a single power in which the central government is ultimately supreme and any administrative divisions ( sub - national units ) exercise only the powers that the central government chooses to delegate .
The majority of states in the world have a unitary system of government .
Of the 193 UN member states , 165 are governed as unitary states .
In a unitary state , sub - national units are created and abolished ( an example being the 22 mainland regions of France being merged into 13 ) , and their powers may be broadened and narrowed , by the central government .
Although political power may be delegated through devolution to local governments by statute , the central government remains supreme ; it may abrogate the acts of devolved governments or curtail their powers .
The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is an example of a unitary state .
Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland have a degree of autonomous devolved power , but such power is delegated by the Parliament of the United Kingdom , which may enact laws unilaterally altering or abolishing devolution ( England does not have any devolved power ) .
Many unitary states have no areas possessing a degree of autonomy .
In such countries , sub - national regions can not decide their own laws .
Examples are the Republic of Ireland and the Kingdom of Norway .
Unitary states are contrasted with federations , or federal states .
In such states , the sub - national governments share powers with the central government as equal actors through a written constitution , to which the consent of both is required to make amendments .
This means that the sub - national units have a right of existence and powers that can not be unilaterally changed by the central government .
