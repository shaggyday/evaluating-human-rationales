After busting a human trafficking ring , former military investigator turned vigilante drifter Jack Reacher returns to his old military headquarters to meet Major Susan Turner , whom he has been working with during his travels and has become his closest friend â€“ only to learn from Colonel Sam Morgan that Turner has been accused of espionage and detained .
Turner 's attorney , Colonel Bob Moorcroft , reveals that there is evidence that Turner is involved in the murders of two soldiers in Afghanistan , but Reacher believes she is being framed .
Moorcroft also reveals an old acquaintance of Reacher , Candice Dutton , has filed a paternity suit against him , claiming he is the biological father of her 15-year - old daughter , Samantha Dutton .
Reacher tries to reach out to Samantha , but she rebuffs him , believing he is after her biological mother due to her past as a prostitute .
Moorcroft is later killed by an unknown assassin known as the Hunter .
Reacher is framed for Moorcroft 's murder and arrested and transported to the prison where Turner is being detained .
Two hitmen arrive to kill her , but Reacher neutralizes them , rescues her
and they escape to Morgan 's house , having deduced he is involved in the conspiracy , to extract information .
After they leave , the Hunter , revealed to be working with Morgan , kills Morgan and frames Reacher which he learns about from a friend , Sergeant Leach , when he asks her to investigate a military contractor .
Reacher and Turner uncover surveillance pictures of Samantha and surmise she is in danger , arriving at her home to find her foster parents dead and Samantha hiding in the kitchen .
Reacher and Turner decide to escort Samantha to Turner 's old private school for protection , but discover that she has her mobile phone with her and that the enemy probably knows exactly where they are .
They discard the phone and make a quick exit , during which Samantha steals a backpack from one of the students to use the credit cards .
Reacher , Turner and Samantha travel to New Orleans in search of Daniel Prudhomme , the only eye - witness to the murders for which Turner has been framed .
They find him in a derelict warehouse filled with drug addicts and learn that Prudhomme is connected to Parasource , a private military organization that is trying to cover up the murders .
Reacher contacts Turner 's friend , Captain Anthony Espin , to move Prudhomme into custody , but they are ambushed by assassins and Prudhomme is killed , while Reacher rescues a wounded Espin and finds out that the assassins are Parasource contractors .
Parasource 's CEO , General James Harkness , then sends the Hunter to capture Samantha after she uses a credit card from the backpack she stole to order room service .
Reacher and Turner , along with Espin , acting on information provided by Prudhomme , intercept a flight of weapons due to enter the country , where they confront Harkness and his men and accuse them of corruption .
Upon opening the crates , however , Espin finds weapons as declared in the flight manifest .
Before Turner can be re - arrested , Reacher opens up one of the weapons and discovers that they are filled with opium .
They learn that Harkness framed Turner , who had been investigating his activities , for the murders of two soldiers who discovered that Harkness was selling weapons to insurgents and smuggling drugs into the United States .
Espin and his men then arrest Harkness , clearing Reacher 's and Turner 's names .
The Hunter and his men locate and chase Samantha through the streets to lure Reacher into a confrontation .
Turner kills one of the assassins , whilst Reacher takes out another one on the rooftop .
The Hunter captures Samantha and threatens to kill her , but she manages to escape and steal his gun .
Reacher then tackles the Hunter onto another rooftop , briefly incapacitating both of them , and they have a vicious fight that culminates with Reacher breaking the Hunter 's arm , leg and neck , before dropping him off the rooftop .
Reacher then admits to Samantha he might be her father .
Following Harkness ' arrest , Turner is reinstated in her old position and goes back to her office , where her colleagues and a recovering Captain Espin all welcome her back .
Reacher promises to keep in touch before meeting Samantha at a diner to meet Candice , Samantha 's mother , whom Reacher surmises he will recognize , as he remembers every woman he has slept with .
Samantha reveals that the waitress that had been serving him is in fact Candice , and that Reacher can not be her father , as neither had recognized each other .
Reacher and Samantha then reluctantly part .
A short time later , while Reacher is walking along a road , he is surprised when a phone Samantha had slipped into his pocket rings .
He finds a text message from her reading , " Miss me yet ? " .
Reacher smiles as he sticks out his thumb to hitch a ride .
