WINE GUM Wine gums ( or winegums ) are chewy , firm pastille - type sweets similar to gumdrops without the sugar coating , originating from the United Kingdom .
All brands have their own recipes containing various sweeteners , flavourings , and colourings .
Wine gums are popular in the United Kingdom , Australia , Ireland , South Africa and many Commonwealth nations , as well as several European countries .
Common brands include Maynards , Bassett 's and Lion .
The gums usually come in five shapes : kidney , crown , rhombus , circle and oblong , and are usually labelled with the name of a wine : for example , Maynard 's use port , sherry , champagne , burgundy , and claret ; other manufacturers may prefer different names such as rioja , merlot or rum .
Despite the name , they usually contain no alcohol .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Charles Riley Maynard started his business in 1880 by producing confections in a kitchen with his brother Tom in Stamford Hill , London , while his wife Sarah Ann served the customers .
Maynard 's sweets grew steadily and was launched as a company in 1896 .
Maynard 's Wine Gums were introduced in 1909 by Maynard 's son Charles Gordon Maynard .
It took Charles Gordon Maynard some time to persuade his strict Methodist and teetotaller father that the sweets did not contain wine .
According to Cadbury , red and black are the most popular colours .
The red flavours are traditionally red berry , strawberry , or raspberry - flavoured in the United Kingdom and cherry in the United States .
Black is traditionally blackcurrant flavoured .
Limited edition dark - only wine gum issues have occurred , and more recently , a limited " fruit duos " edition was produced with two colours and flavours on each gum .
