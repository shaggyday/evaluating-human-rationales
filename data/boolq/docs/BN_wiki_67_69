LAST MEAL
A condemned prisoner 's last meal is a customary ritual preceding execution .
Various countries have various traditions in this regard .
A " little glass of rum , " but no formal last meal , was granted to the condemned in historical France in the minutes before execution ; no meal was offered as the condemned learned of their impending execution only on the fatal morning , generally just minutes in advance .
In many countries , the prisoner may , within reason , select what the last meal will be .
CONTEMPORARY RESTRICTIONS
Section::::Contemporary restrictions .
In the United States , most states give the meal a day or two before execution and use the euphemism " special meal " .
Alcohol or tobacco are usually denied .
Unorthodox or unavailable requests are replaced with substitutes .
Some states place tight restrictions .
In Florida , the food for the last meal must be purchased locally and the cost is limited to $ 40 .
In Oklahoma , cost is limited to $ 15 .
In Louisiana , the prison warden traditionally joins the condemned prisoner for the last meal .
On one occasion , the warden paid for an inmate 's lobster dinner .
Sometimes , a prisoner shares the last meal with another inmate ( as Francis Crowley did with John Resko ) or has the meal distributed among other inmates ( as requested by Raymond Fernandez ) .
In September 2011 , the state of Texas abolished all special last meal requests after condemned prisoner Lawrence Russell Brewer requested a huge last meal and did not eat any of it , saying he was not hungry .
His last meal request was for a plate of two chicken - fried steaks with gravy and sliced onions , a triple - patty bacon cheeseburger , a cheese omelet with ground beef , tomatoes , onions , bell peppers , jalapeños , a bowl of fried okra with ketchup , a pound of barbecued meat with half of a loaf of white bread , a portion of three fajitas , a meat - lover 's pizza ( topped with pepperoni , ham , beef , bacon , and sausage ) , a pint of Blue Bell ice cream , a slab of peanut - butter fudge with crushed peanuts , and a serving equivalent to three root beers .
The abolition followed a complaint by a Texas Senator , John Whitmire ( Democrat , of Houston ) , who called the meal " inappropriate " .
The tradition of customized last meals is thought to have been established around 1924 in Texas .
