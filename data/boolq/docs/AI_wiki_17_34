PRINCE PHILIP , DUKE OF EDINBURGH
Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh ( born Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark , 10 June 1921 ) , is the husband and consort of Queen Elizabeth II .
Philip was born into the Greek and Danish royal families .
He was born in Greece , but his family was exiled from the country when he was an infant .
After being educated in France , Germany , and the United Kingdom , he joined the British Royal Navy in 1939 , aged 18 .
From July 1939 , he began corresponding with the 13-year - old Princess Elizabeth , whom he had first met in 1934 .
During the Second World War he served with distinction in the Mediterranean and Pacific Fleets .
After the war , Philip was granted permission by King George VI to marry Elizabeth .
Before the official announcement of their engagement in July 1947 , he abandoned his Greek and Danish royal titles and became a naturalised British subject , adopting the surname Mountbatten from his maternal grandparents .
He married Elizabeth on 20 November 1947 .
Just before the wedding , he was created Baron Greenwich , Earl of Merioneth and Duke of Edinburgh .
Philip left active military service when Elizabeth became monarch in 1952 , having reached the rank of commander , and was formally made a British prince in 1957 .
Prince Philip and Queen Elizabeth II have four children : Prince Charles , Princess Anne , Prince Andrew , and Prince Edward .
Through a British Order in Council issued in 1960 , descendants of Philip and Elizabeth not bearing royal styles and titles can use the surname Mountbatten - Windsor , which has also been used by some members of the royal family who do hold titles , such as Prince Andrew , Princess Anne and Prince Edward .
A keen sports enthusiast , Philip helped develop the equestrian event of carriage driving .
He is a patron , president or member of over 780 organisations and serves as chairman of The Duke of Edinburgh 's Award for people aged 14 to 24 .
He is the longest - serving consort of a reigning British monarch and the oldest - ever male member of the British royal family .
Philip retired from his royal duties on 2 August 2017 , at the age of 96 , after having completed 22,219 solo engagements since 1952 .
EARLY LIFE
Section::::Early life .
Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark was born in Mon Repos on the Greek island of Corfu on 10 June 1921 , the only son and fifth and final child of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg .
Philip 's four elder sisters were Margarita , Theodora , Cecilie , and Sophie .
He was baptised into the Greek Orthodox Church .
His godparents were his paternal grandmother Queen Olga of Greece and Alexandros S. Kokotos , Mayor of Corfu .
Shortly after Philip 's birth , his maternal grandfather , Prince Louis of Battenberg , then known as Louis Mountbatten , Marquess of Milford Haven , died in London .
Louis was a naturalised British citizen , who , after a career in the Royal Navy , had renounced his German titles and adopted the surname Mountbatten , an Anglicized version of Battenberg , during the First World War due to Anti - German sentiment in Great Britain .
After visiting London for the memorial , Philip and his mother returned to Greece where Prince Andrew had remained behind to command an army division embroiled in the Greco - Turkish War ( 1919â€“1922 ) .
The war went badly for Greece , and the Turks made large gains .
On 22 September 1922 , Philip 's uncle , King Constantine I , was forced to abdicate and the new military government arrested Prince Andrew , along with others .
The commander of the army , General Georgios Hatzianestis , and five senior politicians were executed .
Prince Andrew 's life was believed to be in danger , and Alice was under surveillance .
In December , a revolutionary court banished Prince Andrew from Greece for life .
The British naval vessel HMS Calypso evacuated Prince Andrew 's family , with Philip carried to safety in a cot made from a fruit box .
Philip 's family went to France , where they settled in the Paris suburb of Saint - Cloud in a house lent to them by his wealthy aunt , Princess George of Greece and Denmark .
Because Philip left Greece as a baby , he does not have a strong grasp of the Greek language .
In 1992 , he said that he " could understand a certain amount " .
Philip has stated that he has thought of himself as Danish , and his family spoke English , French , and German .
Philip , who in his youth was known for his charm , was linked to a number of women including Osla Benning .
YOUTH
EDUCATION
Section::::Youth .
Section::::Education .
Philip was first educated at The Elms , an American school in Paris run by Donald MacJannet , who described Philip as a " know it all smarty person , but always remarkably polite " .
In 1928 , he was sent to the United Kingdom to attend Cheam School , living with his maternal grandmother , Victoria Mountbatten , Dowager Marchioness of Milford Haven , at Kensington Palace and his uncle , George Mountbatten , 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven , at Lynden Manor in Bray , Berkshire .
In the next three years , his four sisters married German noblemen and moved to Germany , his mother was placed in an asylum after being diagnosed with schizophrenia , and his father took up residence in Monte Carlo .
Philip had little contact with his mother for the remainder of his childhood .
In 1933 , he was sent to Schule Schloss Salem in Germany , which had the " advantage of saving school fees " because it was owned by the family of his brother - in - law , Berthold , Margrave of Baden .
With the rise of Nazism in Germany , Salem 's Jewish founder , Kurt Hahn , fled persecution and founded Gordonstoun School in Scotland .
After two terms at Salem , Philip moved to Gordonstoun .
In 1937 , his sister Cecilie , her husband Georg Donatus , Hereditary Grand Duke of Hesse , her two young sons , Ludwig and Alexander , her newborn infant and her mother - in - law , Princess Eleonore of Solms - Hohensolms - Lich , were killed in an air crash at Ostend ; Philip , then sixteen years old , attended the funeral in Darmstadt .
The following year , his uncle and guardian Lord Milford Haven died of bone marrow cancer .
NAVAL AND WARTIME SERVICE Section::::Naval and wartime service .
After leaving Gordonstoun in early 1939 , Philip completed a term as a cadet at the Royal Naval College , Dartmouth , then repatriated to Greece , living with his mother in Athens for a month in mid-1939 .
At the behest of the Greek king , George II , he returned to Britain in September to resume training for the Royal Navy .
He graduated from Dartmouth the next year as the best cadet in his course .
During the Second World War , he continued to serve in the British forces , while two of his brothers - in - law , Prince Christoph of Hesse and Berthold , Margrave of Baden , fought on the opposing German side .
Philip was appointed as a midshipman in January 1940 .
He spent four months on the battleship HMS Ramillies , protecting convoys of the Australian Expeditionary Force in the Indian Ocean , followed by shorter postings on HMS Kent , on HMS Shropshire , and in Ceylon ( now Sri Lanka ) .
After the invasion of Greece by Italy in October 1940 , he was transferred from the Indian Ocean to the battleship in the Mediterranean Fleet .
On 1 February 1941 , he was commissioned as a sub - lieutenant after a series of courses at Portsmouth , in which he gained the top grade in four out of five sections of the qualifying examination .
Among other engagements , he was involved in the Battle of Crete , and was mentioned in dispatches for his service during the Battle of Cape Matapan , in which he controlled the battleship 's searchlights .
He was also awarded the Greek War Cross of Valour .
Duties of lesser glory included stoking the boilers of the troop transport ship RMS Empress of Russia .
In June 1942 , he was appointed to the V and W - class destroyer and flotilla leader HMS Wallace , which was involved in convoy escort tasks on the east coast of Britain , as well as the Allied invasion of Sicily .
Promotion to lieutenant followed on 16 July 1942 .
In October of the same year , he became first lieutenant of HMS Wallace , at 21 years old one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy .
During the invasion of Sicily , in July 1943 , as second in command of HMS Wallace , he saved his ship from a night bomber attack .
He devised a plan to launch a raft with smoke floats that successfully distracted the bombers , allowing the ship to slip away unnoticed .
In 1944 , he moved on to the new destroyer , HMS Whelp , where he saw service with the British Pacific Fleet in the 27th Destroyer Flotilla .
He was present in Tokyo Bay when the instrument of Japanese surrender was signed .
In January 1946 , Philip returned to the United Kingdom on the Whelp , and was posted as an instructor at HMS Royal Arthur , the Petty Officers ' School in Corsham , Wiltshire .
MARRIAGE Section::::Marriage .
In 1939 , King George VI and Queen Elizabeth toured the Royal Naval College , Dartmouth .
During the visit , the Queen and Earl Mountbatten asked Philip to escort the King 's two daughters , Elizabeth and Margaret , who were Philip 's third cousins through Queen Victoria , and second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark .
Elizabeth fell in love with Philip and they began to exchange letters when she was thirteen .
Eventually , in the summer of 1946 , Philip asked the King for his daughter 's hand in marriage .
The King granted his request , provided that any formal engagement be delayed until Elizabeth 's twenty - first birthday the following April .
By March 1947 , Philip had abandoned his Greek and Danish royal titles , had adopted the surname Mountbatten from his mother 's family , and had become a naturalised British subject .
The engagement was announced to the public on 10 July 1947 .
Though Philip appeared " always to have regarded himself as an Anglican " , and he had attended Anglican services with his classmates and relations in England and throughout his Royal Navy days , he had been baptised in the Greek Orthodox Church .
The Archbishop of Canterbury , Geoffrey Fisher , wanted to " regularise " Philip 's position by officially receiving him into the Church of England , which he did in October 1947 .
The day preceding his wedding , King George VI bestowed the style of Royal Highness on Philip and , on the morning of the wedding , 20 November 1947 , he was made the Duke of Edinburgh , Earl of Merioneth , and Baron Greenwich of Greenwich in the County of London .
Consequently , being already a Knight of the Garter , between 19 and 20 November 1947 he bore the unusual style His Royal Highness Sir Philip Mountbatten and is so described in the Letters Patent of 20 November 1947 .
Philip and Elizabeth were married in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey , recorded and broadcast by BBC radio to 200 million people around the world .
However , in post - war Britain , it was not acceptable for any of the Duke of Edinburgh 's German relations to be invited to the wedding , including Philip 's three surviving sisters , all of whom had married German princes , some with Nazi connections .
After their marriage , the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh took up residence at Clarence House .
Their first two children were born : Prince Charles in 1948 and Princess Anne in 1950 .
Their marriage is now the longest of any British sovereign .
Philip was introduced to the House of Lords on 21 July 1948 , immediately before his uncle Earl Mountbatten of Burma .
Philip , like his sons Charles and Andrew and other royals , ceased to be members of the House of Lords following the House of Lords Act 1999 .
He never spoke in the House .
After his honeymoon at the Mountbatten family home , Broadlands , Philip returned to the navy at first in a desk job at the Admiralty , and later on a staff course at the Naval Staff College , Greenwich .
From 1949 , he was stationed in Malta ( residing at Villa Guardamangia ) after being posted as the first lieutenant of the destroyer HMS Chequers , the lead ship of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean Fleet .
On 16 July 1950 , he was promoted to lieutenant commander and given command of the frigate HMS Magpie .
On 30 June 1952 , Philip was promoted to commander , though his active naval career had ended in July 1951 .
With the King in ill health , Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh were both appointed to the Privy Council on 4 November 1951 , after a coast - to - coast tour of Canada .
At the end of January 1952 , Philip and his wife set out on a tour of the Commonwealth .
On 6 February 1952 , when they were in Kenya , Elizabeth 's father died and she became queen .
It was Philip who broke the news of her father 's death to Elizabeth at Sagana Lodge , and the royal party immediately returned to the United Kingdom .
CONSORT OF THE QUEEN ROYAL HOUSE Section::::Consort of the Queen .
Section::::Royal house .
The accession of Elizabeth to the throne brought up the question of the name of the royal house .
The Duke 's uncle , Louis Mountbatten , 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma , advocated the name House of Mountbatten , as Elizabeth would typically have taken Philip 's last name on marriage ; however , when Queen Mary , Elizabeth 's grandmother , heard of this suggestion , she informed the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill , who himself later advised the Queen to issue a royal proclamation declaring that the royal house was to remain known as the House of Windsor .
Churchill 's strong personal antipathy to Lord Mountbatten , whom he considered a dangerous and subversive rival who had lost India , may have contributed to this .
Prince Philip privately complained , " I am nothing but a bloody amoeba .
I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children . "
On 8 February 1960 , several years after the death of Queen Mary and the resignation of Churchill , the Queen issued an Order in Council declaring that Mountbatten - Windsor would be the surname of her and her husband 's male - line descendants who are not styled as Royal Highness or titled as Prince or Princess .
While it seems the Queen had " absolutely set her heart " on such a change and had it in mind for some time , it occurred only eleven days before the birth of Prince Andrew ( 19 February ) , and only after three months of protracted correspondence between constitutional expert Edward Iwi ( who averred that , without such a change , the royal child would be born with " the Badge of Bastardy " ) and Prime Minister Harold Macmillan who had attempted to rebuff Iwi .
After her accession to the throne , the Queen also announced that the Duke was to have " place , pre - eminence and precedence " next to her " on all occasions and in all meetings , except where otherwise provided by Act of Parliament " .
This meant the Duke took precedence over his son , the Prince of Wales , except , officially , in the British parliament .
In fact , however , he attends Parliament only when escorting the Queen for the annual State Opening of Parliament , where he walks and sits beside her .
Contrary to rumours over the years , the Queen and Duke are said by insiders to have had a strong relationship throughout their marriage , despite the challenges of Elizabeth 's reign .
The Queen referred to Prince Philip in a speech on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee in 2012 as her " constant strength and guide " .
DUTIES AND MILESTONES Section::::Duties and milestones .
As consort to the Queen , Philip supported his wife in her new duties as sovereign , accompanying her to ceremonies such as the State Opening of Parliament in various countries , state dinners , and tours abroad .
As Chairman of the Coronation Commission , he was the first member of the royal family to fly in a helicopter , visiting the troops that were to take part in the ceremony .
Philip was not crowned in the service , but knelt before Elizabeth , with her hands enclosing his , and swore to be her " liege man of life and limb " .
In the early 1950s , his sister - in - law , Princess Margaret , considered marrying a divorced older man , Peter Townsend .
The press accused Philip of being hostile to the match , to which he replied " I have n't done anything .
"
Philip had not interfered , preferring to stay out of other people 's love lives .
Eventually , Margaret and Townsend parted .
For six months , over 1953â€“54 , Philip and Elizabeth toured the Commonwealth ; again their children were left in the United Kingdom .
In 1956 , the Duke , with Kurt Hahn , founded The Duke of Edinburgh 's Award in order to give young people " a sense of responsibility to themselves and their communities " .
In the same year , he also established the Commonwealth Study Conferences .
From 1956 to 1957 , Philip travelled around the world aboard the newly commissioned HMY Britannia , during which he opened the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne and visited the Antarctic , becoming the first royal to cross the Antarctic Circle .
The Queen and the children remained in the UK .
On the return leg of the journey , Philip 's private secretary , Mike Parker , was sued for divorce by his wife .
As with Townsend , the press still portrayed divorce as a scandal and eventually Parker resigned .
He later said that the Duke was very supportive and " the Queen was wonderful throughout .
She regarded divorce as a sadness , not a hanging offence .
"
In a public show of support , the Queen created Parker a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order .
Further press reports claimed that the Queen and the Duke were drifting apart , which enraged the Duke and dismayed the Queen , who issued a strongly worded denial .
On 22 February 1957 , she granted her husband the style and title of a Prince of the United Kingdom by Letters Patent , and it was gazetted that he was to be known as " His Royal Highness The Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh " .
Philip was appointed to the Queen 's Privy Council for Canada on 14 October 1957 , taking his Oath of Allegiance before the Queen in person at her Canadian residence , Rideau Hall .
Remarks he made two years later to the Canadian Medical Association on the subject of youth and sport were taken as a suggestion that Canadian children were out of shape .
This was at first considered " tactless " , but Philip was later admired for his encouragement of physical fitness .
In Canada in 1969 , Philip spoke about his views on republicanism :
Philip is patron of some 800 organisations , particularly focused on the environment , industry , sport , and education .
He was President of the National Playing Fields Association ( now known as Fields in Trust ) for 64 years , from 1947 until his grandson Prince William took over the role in 2013 .
He served as UK President of the World Wildlife Fund from 1961 to 1982 , International President from 1981 , and President Emeritus from 1996 .
In 1952 , he became patron of The Industrial Society ( since renamed The Work Foundation ) .
He was President of the International Equestrian Federation from 1964 to 1986 , and has served as Chancellor of the Universities of Cambridge , Edinburgh , Salford , and Wales .
In 2017 , the British Heart Foundation thanked Prince Philip for being its patron for 55 years , during which time , in addition to organising fundraisers , he " supported the creation of nine BHF - funded centres of excellence " .
He is an Honorary Fellow of St Edmund 's College , Cambridge .
At the beginning of 1981 , Philip wrote to his eldest son , Charles , counselling him to make up his mind to either propose to Lady Diana Spencer or break off their courtship .
Charles felt pressured by his father to make a decision and did so , proposing to Diana in February .
They married six months later .
By 1992 , the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales had broken down .
The Queen and Philip hosted a meeting between Charles and Diana , trying to effect a reconciliation , but without success .
Philip wrote to Diana , expressing his disappointment at both Charles 's and her extra - marital affairs , and asking her to examine both his and her behaviour from the other 's point of view .
She found the letters hard to take , but nevertheless she appreciated that he was acting with good intent .
Charles and Diana separated and later divorced .
A year after the divorce , Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997 .
At the time , the Duke was on holiday at Balmoral with the extended royal family .
In their grief , Diana 's two sons , Princes William and Harry , wanted to attend church and so their grandparents took them that morning .
For five days , the Queen and the Duke shielded their grandsons from the ensuing press interest by keeping them at Balmoral , where they could grieve in private .
The royal family 's seclusion caused public dismay , but the public mood changed after a live broadcast made by the Queen on 5 September .
Uncertain as to whether they should walk behind her coffin during the funeral procession , Diana 's sons hesitated .
Philip told William , " If you do n't walk , I think you 'll regret it later .
If I walk , will you walk with me ? "
On the day of the funeral , Philip , William , Harry , Charles and Diana 's brother , Earl Spencer , walked through London behind her bier .
Over the next few years , Mohamed Fayed , whose son Dodi Fayed was also killed in the crash , claimed that Prince Philip had ordered the death of Diana and that the accident was staged .
The inquest into the Princess of Wales 's death concluded in 2008 that there was no evidence of a conspiracy .
Prince Philip receives a Parliamentary annuity ( of Â£ 359,000 since 1990 ) that serves to meet official expenses in carrying out public duties .
The annuity is unaffected by the reform of royal finances under the Sovereign Grant Act 2011 .
Any part of the allowance that is not used to meet official expenditure is liable for tax .
In practice , the entire allowance is used to fund his official duties .
During his wife 's Golden Jubilee in 2002 , the Duke was commended by the Speaker of the British House of Commons for his role in supporting the Queen during her reign .
The Duke of Edinburgh 's time as royal consort exceeds that of any other consort in British history ; however , Queen Elizabeth
The Queen Mother ( his mother - in - law ) , who died aged 101 , has had the longest lifespan to date .
In April 2008 , Philip was admitted to King Edward VII 's Hospital for " assessment and treatment " for a chest infection , though he walked into the hospital unaided and recovered quickly , and was discharged three days later to recuperate at Windsor Castle .
In August , the Evening Standard reported that he was suffering from prostate cancer .
Buckingham Palace , which usually refuses to comment on rumours of ill health , claimed that the report was an invasion of privacy and issued a statement denying the story .
The newspaper retracted the report and admitted it was untrue .
In June 2011 , in an interview marking his 90th birthday he said that he would now slow down and reduce his duties , stating that he had " done [ his ] bit " .
His wife , the Queen , gave him the title Lord High Admiral for his 90th birthday .
While staying at the royal residence at Sandringham , Norfolk , on 23 December 2011 , the Duke suffered chest pains and was taken to the cardio - thoracic unit at Papworth Hospital , Cambridgeshire , where he underwent successful coronary angioplasty and stenting .
He was discharged on 27 December .
On 4 June 2012 , during the celebrations in honour of his wife 's Diamond Jubilee , Philip was taken from Windsor Castle to the King Edward VII Hospital , London , suffering from a bladder infection .
He was released from hospital on 9 June .
After a recurrence of infection in August 2012 , while staying at Balmoral Castle , he was admitted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for five nights as a precautionary measure .
In June 2013 , Philip was admitted to the London Clinic for an exploratory operation on his abdomen , spending 11 days in hospital .
On 21 May 2014 , the Prince appeared in public with a bandage on his right hand after a " minor procedure " was performed in Buckingham Palace the preceding day .
In June 2017 , he was taken from Windsor to London and admitted to King Edward VII Hospital after being diagnosed with an infection .
He spent two nights in the hospital and was unable to attend the State Opening of Parliament and Royal Ascot .
RETIREMENT AND BEYOND Section::::Retirement and beyond .
Prince Philip retired from his royal duties on 2 August 2017 , meeting Royal Marines in his final solo public engagement , aged 96 .
Since 1952 he had completed 22,219 solo engagements .
Prime Minister Theresa May thanked him , via Twitter , for " a remarkable lifetime of service " .
On 20 November 2017 , he celebrated his 70th wedding anniversary with the Queen , which made her the first British monarch to celebrate a platinum wedding anniversary .
On 3 April 2018 , Philip was admitted to the King Edward VII Hospital for a planned hip replacement , which took place the next day .
This came after the Duke missed the annual Maundy and Easter Sunday services .
On 12 April his daughter , Princess Anne , spent about 50 minutes in the hospital and afterwards said her father was " on good form " .
He was discharged the following day .
On 19 May , six weeks later , he attended the wedding of his grandson Prince Harry to actress Meghan Markle and was able to walk with the Queen unaided .
In October that year , he accompanied the Queen to the wedding of their granddaughter Princess Eugenie to Jack Brooksbank , with The Daily Telegraph reporting that Philip works on a " wake up and see how I feel " basis when deciding whether to attend an event or not .
PERSONALITY AND IMAGE Section::::Personality and image .
Philip played polo until 1971 , when he started to compete in carriage driving , a sport which he helped expand ; the early rule book was drafted under his supervision .
He was a keen yachtsman , striking up a friendship in 1949 with Uffa Fox in Cowes .
He and the Queen regularly attended Cowes Week in HMY Britannia .
His first airborne flying lesson took place in 1952 ; by his 70th birthday he had accrued 5,150 pilot hours .
He was presented with Royal Air Force wings in 1953 .
In April 2014 , it was reported that an old British Pathe newsreel film had been discovered of Philip 's 1962 two - month flying tour of South America .
Filmed sitting alongside Philip at the aircraft 's controls was his co - pilot Captain Peter Middleton , the grandfather of the Duke 's granddaughter - in - law , Catherine , Duchess of Cambridge .
He has painted with oils , and collected artworks , including contemporary cartoons , which hang at Buckingham Palace , Windsor Castle , Sandringham House , and Balmoral Castle .
Hugh Casson described Philip 's own artwork as " exactly what you 'd expect ... totally direct , no hanging about .
Strong colours , vigorous brushstrokes . "
His down - to - earth manner was attested to by a White House butler who recalled that , on a visit in 1979 , Philip had engaged him and a fellow butler in a conversation , and poured them drinks .
As well as a reputation for bluntness and plain speaking , Philip is noted for occasionally making observations and jokes that have been construed as either funny , or as gaffes : awkward , politically incorrect or even offensive , but sometimes perceived as stereotypical of someone of his age and background .
In an address to the General Dental Council in 1960 , he jokingly coined a new word for his blunders : " Dontopedalogy is the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it , a science which I have practised for a good many years . "
Later in life he suggested his comments may have contributed to the perception that he is " a cantankerous old sod " .
The historian David Starkey has described him as a kind of " HRH Victor Meldrew " .
For example , in May 1999 British newspapers accused Philip of insulting deaf children at a pop concert in Wales by saying , " No wonder you are deaf listening to this row . "
Later Philip wrote , " The story is largely invention .
It so happens that my mother was quite seriously deaf and I have been Patron of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf for ages , so it 's hardly likely that I would do any such thing .
" When he and the Queen met Stephen Menary , an army cadet blinded by an IRA bomb , and the Queen enquired how much sight he retained , Philip quipped : " Not a lot , judging by the tie he 's wearing . "
Menary later said : " I think he just tries to put people at ease by trying to make a joke .
I certainly did n't take any offence . "
During a state visit to the People 's Republic of China in 1986 , in a private conversation with British students from Xi'an 's North West University , Philip joked , " If you stay here much longer , you 'll go slit - eyed . "
The British press reported on the remark as indicative of racial intolerance , but the Chinese authorities were reportedly unconcerned .
Chinese students studying in the UK , an official explained , were often told in jest not to stay away too long , lest they go " round - eyed " .
His comment had no effect on Sino - British relations , but it shaped his own reputation .
TITLES , STYLES , HONOURS AND ARMS Section::::Titles , styles , honours and arms .
Philip has held a number of titles throughout his life .
Originally holding the title and style of a prince of Greece and Denmark , Philip abandoned these royal titles prior to his marriage , and was thereafter created a British duke , among other noble titles .
The Queen formally issued letters patent in 1957 making Philip a British prince .
When addressing the Duke of Edinburgh , as with any male member of the royal family except the monarch , the rules of etiquette are to address him the first time as Your Royal Highness , and thereafter as Sir .
HONOURS AND HONORARY MILITARY APPOINTMENTS
Section::::Honours and honorary military appointments .

Since then , Philip has received 17 different appointments and decorations in the Commonwealth , and 48 from foreign states .
The inhabitants of some villages on the island of Tanna , Vanuatu worship Prince Philip as a god ; the islanders possess portraits of the Duke and hold feasts on his birthday .

Philip is a great - grandson of Christian IX of Denmark , and as such belongs in male line to the Danish House of GlÃ¼cksburg , originally a cadet branch of the House of Oldenburg , which held several thrones and provided consorts to rulers of Russia and Great Britain in the 19th and 20th centuries .
In 1993 , scientists were able to confirm the identity of the remains of several members of Empress Alexandra of Russia 's family , more than seventy years after their massacre in 1918 , by comparing their mitochondrial DNA to living matrilineal relatives , including Prince Philip , her maternal grandnephew .
Philip , Alexandra and her children are all descended from Princess Alice of the United Kingdom , the daughter of Queen Victoria , through a purely female line .
PORTRAYALS IN FILM AND LITERATURE Section::::Portrayals in film and literature .
