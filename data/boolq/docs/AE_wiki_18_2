SPIDER - MAN Spider - Man is a fictional superhero created by writer - editor Stan Lee and writer - artist Steve Ditko .
He first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy # 15 ( August 1962 ) in the Silver Age of Comic Books .
He appears in American comic books published by Marvel Comics , as well as in a number of movies , television shows , and video game adaptations set in the Marvel Universe .
In the stories , Spider - Man is the alias of Peter Parker , an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker were killed in a plane crash .
Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues , and accompanied him with many supporting characters , such as J. Jonah Jameson , Flash Thompson , Harry Osborn , romantic interests Gwen Stacy and Mary Jane Watson , and foes such as Doctor Octopus , Green Goblin and Venom .
His origin story has him acquiring spider - related abilities after a bite from a radioactive spider ; these include clinging to surfaces , shooting spider - webs from wrist - mounted devices , and detecting danger with his " spider - sense " .
When Spider - Man first appeared in the early 1960s , teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist .
The Spider - Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker , a high school student from Queens behind Spider - Man 's secret identity and with whose " self - obsessions with rejection , inadequacy , and loneliness " young readers could relate .
While Spider - Man had all the makings of a sidekick , unlike previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin , Spider - Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman ; he thus had to learn for himself that " with great power there must also come great responsibility"—a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider - Man story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian , the late Uncle Ben .
Marvel has featured Spider - Man in several comic book series , the first and longest - lasting of which is The Amazing Spider - Man .
Over the years , the Peter Parker character developed from a shy , nerdy New York City high school student to troubled but outgoing college student , to married high school teacher to , in the late 2000s , a single freelance photographer .
In the 2010s , he joins the Avengers , Marvel 's flagship superhero team .
Spider - Man 's nemesis Doctor Octopus also took on the identity for a story arc spanning 2012–2014 , following a body swap plot in which Peter appears to die .
Marvel has also published books featuring alternate versions of Spider - Man , including Spider - Man 2099 , which features the adventures of Miguel O'Hara , the Spider - Man of the future ; Ultimate Spider - Man , which features the adventures of a teenaged Peter Parker in an alternate universe ; and Ultimate Comics Spider - Man , which depicts the teenager Miles Morales , who takes up the mantle of Spider - Man after Ultimate Peter Parker 's supposed death .
Miles is later brought into mainstream continuity , where he works alongside Peter .
Spider - Man is one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes .
As Marvel 's flagship character and company mascot , he has appeared in countless forms of media , including several animated and live action television series , syndicated newspaper comic strips , and in a series of films .
The character was first portrayed in live action by Danny Seagren in Spidey Super Stories , a The Electric Company skit which ran from 1974 to 1977 .
In films , Spider - Man has been portrayed by actors Tobey Maguire , Andrew Garfield , and Tom Holland .
Reeve Carney starred as Spider - Man in the 2010 Broadway musical .
Spider - Man has been well received as a superhero and comic book character , and he is often ranked as one of the most popular and iconic comic book characters of all time .

Section::::Creation and development .
In 1962 , with the success of the Fantastic Four , Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was casting about for a new superhero idea .
He said the idea for Spider - Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books , and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify .
In his autobiography , Lee cites the non - superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider as a great influence , and in a multitude of print and video interviews , Lee stated he was further inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wall — adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of whether or not this is true .
Although at the time teenage superheroes were usually given names ending with " boy " , Lee says he chose " Spider - Man " because he wanted the character to age as the series progressed , and moreover felt the name " Spider - Boy " would have made the character sound inferior to other superheroes .
At that time Lee had to get only the consent of Marvel publisher Martin Goodman for the character 's approval .
In a 1986 interview , Lee described in detail his arguments to overcome Goodman 's objections .
Goodman eventually agreed to a Spider - Man tryout in what Lee in numerous interviews recalled as what would be the final issue of the science - fiction and supernatural anthology series Amazing Adult Fantasy , which was renamed Amazing Fantasy for that single issue , # 15 ( cover - dated August 1962 , on sale June 5 , 1962 ) .
In particular , Lee stated that the fact that it had already been decided that Amazing Fantasy would be cancelled after issue # 15 was the only reason Goodman allowed him to use Spider - Man .
While this was indeed the final issue , its editorial page anticipated the comic continuing and that " The Spiderman [ sic ] ... will appear every month in Amazing . "
Regardless , Lee received Goodman 's approval for the name Spider - Man and the " ordinary teen " concept and approached artist Jack Kirby .
As comics historian Greg Theakston recounts , Kirby told Lee about an unpublished character on which he had collaborated with Joe Simon in the 1950s , in which an orphaned boy living with an old couple finds a magic ring that granted him superhuman powers .
Lee and Kirby " immediately sat down for a story conference " , Theakston writes , and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages .
Steve Ditko would be the inker .
When Kirby showed Lee the first six pages , Lee recalled , " I hated the way he was doing it !
Not that he did it badly — it just was n't the character I wanted ; it was too heroic " .
Lee turned to Ditko , who developed a visual style Lee found satisfactory .
Ditko recalled : Although the interior artwork was by Ditko alone , Lee rejected Ditko 's cover art and commissioned Kirby to pencil a cover that Ditko inked .
As Lee explained in 2010 , " I think I had Jack sketch out a cover for it because I always had a lot of confidence in Jack 's covers . "
In an early recollection of the character 's creation , Ditko described his and Lee 's contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in Comic Fan # 2 ( Summer 1965 ) : " Stan Lee thought the name up .
I did costume , web gimmick on wrist & spider signal .
" At the time , Ditko shared a Manhattan studio with noted fetish artist Eric Stanton , an art - school classmate who , in a 1988 interview with Theakston , recalled that although his contribution to Spider - Man was " almost nil " , he and Ditko had " worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas .
But the whole thing was created by Steve on his own ...
I think I added the business about the webs coming out of his hands . "
Kirby disputed Lee 's version of the story and claimed Lee had minimal involvement in the character 's creation .
According to Kirby , the idea for Spider - Man had originated with Kirby and Joe Simon , who in the 1950s had developed a character called the Silver Spider for the Crestwood Publications comic Black Magic , who was subsequently not used .
Simon , in his 1990 autobiography , disputed Kirby 's account , asserting that Black Magic was not a factor , and that he ( Simon ) devised the name " Spider - Man " ( later changed to " The Silver Spider " ) , while Kirby outlined the character 's story and powers .
Simon later elaborated that his and Kirby 's character conception became the basis for Simon 's Archie Comics superhero the Fly .
Artist Steve Ditko stated that Lee liked the name Hawkman from DC Comics , and that " Spider - Man " was an outgrowth of that interest .
Simon concurred that Kirby had shown the original Spider - Man version to Lee , who liked the idea and assigned Kirby to draw sample pages of the new character but disliked the results — in Simon 's description , " Captain America with cobwebs " .
Writer Mark Evanier notes that Lee 's reasoning that Kirby 's character was too heroic seems unlikely
— Kirby still drew the covers for Amazing Fantasy # 15 and the first issue of The Amazing Spider - Man .
Evanier also disputes Kirby 's given reason that he was " too busy " to draw Spider - Man in addition to his other duties since Kirby was , said Evanier , " always busy " .
Neither Lee 's nor Kirby 's explanation explains why key story elements like the magic ring were dropped ; Evanier states that the most plausible explanation for the sudden change was that Goodman , or one of his assistants , decided that Spider - Man , as drawn and envisioned by Kirby , was too similar to the Fly .
Author and Ditko scholar Blake Bell writes that it was Ditko who noted the similarities to the Fly .
Ditko recalled that " Stan called Jack about the Fly " , adding that " [ d]ays later , Stan told me I would be penciling the story panel breakdowns from Stan 's synopsis " .
It was at this point that the nature of the strip changed .
" Out went the magic ring , adult Spider - Man and whatever legend ideas that Spider - Man story would have contained " .
Lee gave Ditko the premise of a teenager bitten by a spider and developing powers , a premise Ditko would expand upon to the point he became what Bell describes as " the first work for hire artist of his generation to create and control the narrative arc of his series " .
On the issue of the initial creation , Ditko states , " I still do n't know whose idea was Spider - Man " .
Kirby noted in a 1971 interview that it was Ditko who " got Spider - Man to roll , and the thing caught on because of what he did " .
Lee , while claiming credit for the initial idea , has acknowledged Ditko 's role , stating , " If Steve wants to be called co - creator , I think he deserves [ it ] " .
He has further commented that Ditko 's costume design was key to the character 's success ; since the costume completely covers Spider - Man 's body , people of all races could visualize themselves inside the costume and thus more easily identify with the character .
COMMERCIAL SUCCESS Section::::Commercial success .
A few months after Spider - Man 's introduction , publisher Goodman reviewed the sales figures for that issue and was shocked to find it was one of the nascent Marvel 's highest - selling comics .
A solo ongoing series followed , beginning with The Amazing Spider - Man # 1 ( cover - dated March 1963 ) .
The title eventually became Marvel 's top - selling series with the character swiftly becoming a cultural icon ; a 1965 Esquire poll of college campuses found that college students ranked Spider - Man and fellow Marvel hero the Hulk alongside Bob Dylan and Che Guevara as their favorite revolutionary icons .
One interviewee selected Spider - Man because he was " beset by woes , money problems , and the question of existence .
In short , he is one of us . "
Following Ditko 's departure after issue # 38 ( July 1966 ) , John Romita , Sr . replaced him as penciler and would draw the series for the next several years .
In 1968 , Romita would also draw the character 's extra - length stories in the comics magazine
The Spectacular Spider - Man , a proto - graphic novel designed to appeal to older readers .
It only lasted for two issues , but it represented the first Spider - Man spin - off publication , aside from the original series ' summer annuals that began in 1964 .
An early 1970s Spider - Man story led to the revision of the Comics Code .
Previously , the Code forbade the depiction of the use of illegal drugs , even negatively .
However , in 1970 , the Nixon administration 's Department of Health , Education , and Welfare asked Stan Lee to publish an anti - drug message in one of Marvel 's top - selling titles .
Lee chose the top - selling The Amazing Spider - Man ; issues # 96–98 ( May – July 1971 ) feature a story arc depicting the negative effects of drug use .
In the story , Peter Parker 's friend Harry Osborn becomes addicted to pills .
When Spider - Man fights the Green Goblin ( Norman Osborn , Harry 's father ) , Spider - Man defeats the Green Goblin , by revealing Harry 's drug addiction .
While the story had a clear anti - drug message , the Comics Code Authority refused to issue its seal of approval .
Marvel nevertheless published the three issues without the Comics Code Authority 's approval or seal .
The issues sold so well that the industry 's self - censorship was undercut and the Code was subsequently revised .
In 1972 , a second monthly ongoing series starring Spider - Man began : Marvel Team - Up , in which Spider - Man was paired with other superheroes and villains .
From that point on there have generally been at least two ongoing Spider - Man series at any time .
In 1976 , his second solo series , Peter Parker , the Spectacular Spider - Man began running parallel to the main series .
A third series featuring Spider - Man , Web of Spider - Man , launched in 1985 to replace Marvel Team - Up .
The launch of a fourth monthly title in 1990 , the " adjectiveless " ( with the storyline " Torment " ) , written and drawn by popular artist Todd McFarlane , debuted with several different covers , all with the same interior content .
The various versions combined sold over 3 million copies , an industry record at the time .
Several limited series , one - shots , and loosely related comics have also been published , and Spider - Man makes frequent cameos and guest appearances in other comic series .
In 1996 The Sensational Spider - Man was created to replace Web of Spider - Man .
In 1998 writer - artist John Byrne revamped the origin of Spider - Man in the 13-issue limited series ( December 1998 – October 1999 ) , similar to Byrne 's adding details and some revisions to Superman 's origin in DC Comics ' The Man of Steel .
At the same time the original The Amazing Spider - Man was ended with issue # 441 ( November 1998 ) , and The Amazing Spider - Man was restarted with vol .
2 ,
# 1 ( January 1999 ) .
In 2003 Marvel reintroduced the original numbering for The Amazing Spider - Man and what would have been vol .
2
, # 59 became issue # 500 ( December 2003 ) .
When primary series The Amazing Spider - Man reached issue # 545 ( December 2007 ) , Marvel dropped its spin - off ongoing series and instead began publishing The Amazing Spider - Man three times monthly , beginning with # 546–548 ( all January 2008 ) .
The three times monthly scheduling of The Amazing Spider - Man lasted until November 2010 when the comic book was increased from 22 pages to 30 pages each issue and published only twice a month , beginning with # 648–649 ( both November 2010 ) .
The following year , Marvel launched Avenging Spider - Man as the first spinoff ongoing series in addition to the still twice monthly The Amazing Spider - Man since the previous ones were cancelled at the end of 2007 .
The Amazing series temporarily ended with issue # 700 in December 2012 , and was replaced by The Superior Spider - Man , which had Doctor Octopus serve as the new Spider - Man , having taken over Peter Parker 's body .
Superior was an enormous commercial success for Marvel , and ran for 31-issue before the real Peter Parker returned in a newly relaunched The Amazing Spider - Man # 1 in April 2014 .
Following the 2015 Secret Wars event , a number of Spider - Man - related titles were either relaunched or created as part of the " All - New , All - Different Marvel " event .
Among them , The Amazing Spider - Man was relaunched as well and primarily focuses on Peter Parker continuing to run Parker Industries , and becoming a successful businessman who is operating worldwide .

BIOGRAPHY
Section::::Character synopsis .
Section::::Fictional character biography .
In Forest Hills , Queens , New York , Midtown High School student Peter Benjamin Parker is a science - whiz orphan living with his Uncle Ben and
Aunt May. As depicted in Amazing Fantasy # 15 ( August 1962 ) , he is bitten by a radioactive spider ( erroneously classified as an insect in the panel ) at a science exhibit and " acquires the agility and proportionate strength of an arachnid " .
Along with heightened athletic abilities , Parker gains the ability to adhere to walls and ceilings .
Through his native knack for science , he develops a gadget that lets him fire adhesive webbing of his own design through small , wrist - mounted barrels .
Initially seeking to capitalize on his new abilities , Parker dons a costume and , as " Spider - Man " , becomes a novelty television star .
However , " He blithely ignores the chance to stop a fleeing thief , [ and ] his indifference ironically catches up with him when the same criminal later robs and kills his Uncle Ben . "
Spider - Man tracks and subdues the killer and learns , in the story 's next - to - last caption , " With great power there must also come — great responsibility ! "
Despite his superpowers , Parker struggles to help his widowed aunt pay rent , is taunted by his peers — particularly football star Flash Thompson — and , as Spider - Man , engenders the editorial wrath of newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson .
As he battles his enemies for the first time , Parker finds juggling his personal life and costumed adventures difficult .
In time , Peter graduates from high school , and enrolls at Empire State University ( a fictional institution evoking the real - life Columbia University and New York University ) , where he meets roommate and best friend Harry Osborn , and girlfriend Gwen Stacy , and Aunt May introduces him to Mary Jane Watson .
As Peter deals with Harry 's drug problems , and Harry 's father is revealed to be Spider - Man 's nemesis the Green Goblin , Peter even attempts to give up his costumed identity for a while .
Gwen Stacy 's father , New York City Police detective captain George Stacy is accidentally killed during a battle between Spider - Man and Doctor Octopus ( # 90 , November 1970 ) .
In issue # 121 ( June 1973 ) , the Green Goblin throws Gwen Stacy from a tower of either the Brooklyn Bridge ( as depicted in the art ) or
the George Washington Bridge ( as given in the text ) .
She dies during Spider - Man 's rescue attempt ; a note on the letters page of issue # 125 states : " It saddens us to say that the whiplash effect she underwent when Spidey 's webbing stopped her so suddenly was , in fact , what killed her . "
The following issue , the Goblin appears to kill himself accidentally in the ensuing battle with Spider - Man .
Working through his grief , Parker eventually develops tentative feelings toward Watson , and the two " become confidants rather than lovers " .
A romantic relationship eventually develops , with Parker proposing to her in issue # 182 ( July 1978 ) , and being turned down an issue later .
Parker went on to graduate from college in issue # 185 , and becomes involved with the shy Debra Whitman and the extroverted , flirtatious costumed thief Felicia Hardy , the Black Cat , whom he meets in issue # 194 ( July 1979 ) .
From 1984 to 1988 , Spider - Man wore a black costume with a white spider design on his chest .
The new costume originated in the Secret Wars limited series , on an alien planet where Spider - Man participates in a battle between Earth 's major superheroes and villains .
He continues wearing the costume when he returns , starting in The Amazing Spider - Man # 252 .
The change to a longstanding character 's design met with controversy , " with many hardcore comics fans decrying it as tantamount to sacrilege .
Spider - Man 's traditional red and blue costume was iconic , they argued , on par with those of his D.C. rivals Superman and Batman .
" The creators then revealed the costume was an alien symbiote which Spider - Man is able to reject after a difficult struggle , though the symbiote returns several times as Venom for revenge .
Parker proposes to Watson a second time in The Amazing Spider - Man # 290 ( July 1987 ) , and she accepts two issues later , with the wedding taking place in The Amazing Spider - Man Annual # 21 ( 1987 ) .
It was promoted with a real - life mock wedding using models , including Tara Shannon as Watson , with Stan Lee officiating at the June 5 , 1987 , event at Shea Stadium .
However , David Michelinie , who scripted based on a plot by editor - in - chief Jim Shooter , said in 2007 , " I did n't think they actually should [ have gotten ] married . ...
I had actually planned another version , one that was n't used . "
In a controversial storyline , Peter becomes convinced that Ben Reilly , the Scarlet Spider ( a clone of Peter created by his college professor Miles Warren ) is the real Peter Parker , and that he , Peter , is the clone .
Peter gives up the Spider - Man identity to Reilly for a time , until Reilly is killed by the returning Green Goblin and revealed to be the clone after all .
In stories published in 2005 and 2006 ( such as " ") , he develops additional spider - like abilities including biological web - shooters , toxic stingers that extend from his forearms , the ability to stick individuals to his back , enhanced Spider - sense and night vision , and increased strength and speed .
Peter later becomes a member of the New Avengers , and reveals his civilian identity to the world , increasing his already numerous problems .
His marriage to Mary Jane and public unmasking are later erased in another controversial storyline " " , in a Faustian bargain with the demon Mephisto that results in several other adjustments to the timeline , including the resurrection of Harry Osborn and the return of Spider - Man 's traditional tools and powers .
That storyline came at the behest of editor - in - chief Joe Quesada , who said , " Peter being single is an intrinsic part of the very foundation of the world of Spider - Man " .
It caused unusual public friction between Quesada and writer J. Michael Straczynski , who " told Joe that I was going to take my name off the last two issues of the [ story ] arc " but was talked out of doing so .
At issue with Straczynski 's climax to the arc , Quesada said , was Following the " reboot " , Parker 's identity was no longer known to the general public ; however , he revealed it to other superheroes .
and others have deduced it .
Parker 's Aunt May marries J. Jonah Jameson 's father , Jay Jameson .
Parker became an employee of the think - tank Horizon Labs .
In issue # 700 , the dying supervillain Doctor Octopus swaps bodies with Parker , who remains as a presence in Doctor Octopus 's mind , prompting a two - year storyline in the series The Superior Spider - Man in which Peter Parker is absent and Doctor Octopus is Spider - Man .
Peter eventually regains control of his body .
Following Peter Parker 's return , The Amazing Spider - Man was relaunched in April 2014 , with Peter Parker becoming a billionaire after the formation of Parker Industries .
In December 2014 , following the Death of Wolverine comic book , Spider - Man became a new teacher at the Jean Grey School and began appearing more prominently in X - Men stories , taking Wolverine 's role in the comic Wolverine and the X - Men .
PERSONALITY AND THEMES Section::::Personality and themes .
As one contemporaneous journalist observed , " Spider - Man has a terrible identity problem , a marked inferiority complex , and a fear of women .
He is anti - social , castration - ridden , racked with Oedipal guilt , and accident - prone ...
[ a ] functioning neurotic " .
Agonizing over his choices , always attempting to do right , he is nonetheless viewed with suspicion by the authorities , who seem unsure as to whether he is a helpful vigilante or a clever criminal .

Unlike a lot of well - known rivalries in comics book depictions , Spider - Man is cited to have more than one archenemy and it can be debated or disputed as to which one is worse :
* Doctor Octopus is regarded as one of Spider - Man 's worst enemies and archenemy .
He has been cited as the man Peter might have become if he had not been raised with a sense of responsibility .
He is infamous for defeating him the first time in battle and for almost marrying Peter 's
Aunt May. He is the core leader of the Sinister Six and has also referred himself as the " Master Planner " .
( " If This Be My Destiny ... ! " ) Later depictions revealed him in Peter Parker 's body where he was the titular character for a while .
* Norman Osborn using the Green Goblin alias is as commonly described as Spider - Man 's archenemy .
Mostly after he is the first villain to uncover the hero 's true identity , being responsible for setting up the death of Spider - Man 's girlfriend in one of the most famous Spider - Man stories of all time which helped end the Silver Age of Comic Books and begin the Bronze Age of Comic Books .
He was thought to be dead after that but writers help bring him back from the 1990s and he returned to plague Spider - Man once more in the comic books ( such as being involved of the killing of Aunt May ) and other heroes ( such as the Avengers ) .
He is also an enemy of Spider - Man sometimes just as himself and not just only as his Goblin persona .
*
Another character commonly described as an archenemy is Venom .
Eddie Brock as Venom is commonly described as the mirror version or the evil version of Spider - Man in many ways .
Venom 's goals is usually depicted as trying to ruin Spider - Man 's life and mess with Spider - Man 's head when it comes to targeting enemies .
Venom is cited as being one of the most popular Spider - Man villains .
This popularity has led him to be an established iconic character of his own with own comic book stories .
Within the Marvel Universe there exists a multiverse with many variations of Spider - Men .
An early character included in the 1980 's is the fictional anthropomorphic funny animal parody of Spider - Man in pig form named Spider - Ham ( Peter Porker ) .
Many imprints of Spider - Men were created like the futuristic version of Spider - Man in Marvel 2099 named Miguel O'Hara .
In Marvel Comics 2 imprint , Peter marries Mary Jane and has a daughter named Mayday Parker who carries on Spider - Man 's legacy and Marvel Noir has a 1930 's version of Peter Parker .
Ultimate Spider - Man was a popular modern retelling of Peter Parker .
The version of Parker would later be depicted as being killed off and replaced by an Afro - Latino Spider - Man named Miles Morales .
The storyline " Spider - Verse " brought back many alternate takes on Spider - Man and introduced many new inspired ones such as an alternate world where Gwen Stacy gets bitten by a radioactive spider instead along with a British themed version named Spider - UK called Billy Braddock from Captain Britain Corps .
CULTURAL INFLUENCE
Section::::Cultural influence .
In The Creation of Spider - Man , comic book writer - editor and historian Paul Kupperberg calls the character 's superpowers " nothing too original " ; what was original was that outside his secret identity , he was a " nerdy high school student " .
Going against typical superhero fare , Spider - Man included " heavy doses of soap - opera and elements of melodrama " .
Kupperberg feels that Lee and Ditko had created something new in the world of comics : " the flawed superhero with everyday problems " .
This idea spawned a " comics revolution " .
The insecurity and anxieties in Marvel 's early 1960s comic books such as The Amazing Spider - Man , The Incredible Hulk , and X - Men ushered in a new type of superhero , very different from the certain and all - powerful superheroes before them , and changed the public 's perception of them .
Spider - Man has become one of the most recognizable fictional characters in the world , and has been used to sell toys , games , cereal , candy , soap , and many other products .
Spider - Man has become Marvel 's flagship character and has often been used as the company mascot .
When Marvel became the first comic book company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1991 , the Wall Street Journal announced " Spider - Man is coming to Wall Street " ; the event was in turn promoted with an actor in a Spider - Man costume accompanying Stan Lee to the Stock Exchange .
Since 1962 , hundreds of millions of comics featuring the character have been sold around the world .
Spider - Man is the world 's most profitable superhero .
In 2014 , global retail sales of licensed products related to Spider - Man reached approximately $ 1.3 billion .
Comparatively , this amount exceeds the global licensing revenue of Batman , Superman , and the Avengers combined .
Spider - Man is also one of the highest - grossing franchise titles being the highest - grossing American comic book superhero worldwide .
Spider - Man joined the Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade from 1987 to 1998 as one of the balloon floats , designed by John Romita Sr . , one of the character 's signature artists .
