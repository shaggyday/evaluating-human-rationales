MYCOSIS FUNGOIDES Mycosis fungoides , also known as Alibert - Bazin syndrome or granuloma fungoides , is the most common form of cutaneous T - cell lymphoma .
It generally affects the skin , but may progress internally over time .
Symptoms include rash , tumors , skin lesions , and itchy skin .
While the cause remains unclear , most cases are not hereditary .
Most cases are in people over 20 years of age , and it is more common in men than women .
Treatment options include sunlight exposure , ultraviolet light , topical corticosteroids , chemotherapy , and radiotherapy .
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Section::::Signs and symptoms .
Typical visible symptoms include rash - like patches , tumors , or lesions .
Itching ( pruritus ) is common , perhaps in 20 percent of patients , but is not universal .
The symptoms displayed are progressive , with early stages consisting of lesions presented as scaly patches .
These lesions prefer the buttock region .
The later stages involve the patches evolving into plaques distributed over the entire body .
The advanced stage of mycosis fungoides is characterized by generalized erythroderma , with severe pruritus and scaling .
CAUSE Section::::Cause .
The cause of mycosis fungoides is unknown , but it is not believed to be hereditary or genetic in the vast majority of cases .
One incident has been reported of a possible genetic link .
It is not contagious .
The disease is an unusual expression of CD4 T cells , a part of the immune system .
These T cells are skin - associated , meaning they are biochemically and biologically most related to the skin , in a dynamic manner .
Mycosis fungoides is the most common type of cutaneous T - cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) , but there are many other types of CTCL that have nothing to do with mycosis fungoides and these disorders are treated differently .
DIAGNOSIS Section::::Diagnosis .
Diagnosis is sometimes difficult because the early phases of the disease often resemble eczema or even psoriasis .
Several biopsies are recommended , to be more certain of the diagnosis .
The criteria for the disease are established on the skin biopsy :
* the superficial papillary dermis is infiltrated by a bandlike lymphocyte infiltrate
* epidermotropism
* presence of atypical " cerebriform " T - cells in the dermal and epidermal infiltrates .
Pautrier microabcesses ( i.e. , Aggregates of four or more atypical lymphocytes arranged in the epidermis ) are characteristic of the disease but are generally absent .
To stage the disease , various tests may be ordered , to assess nodes , blood and internal organs , but most patients present with disease apparently confined to the skin , as patches ( flat spots ) and plaques ( slightly raised or ' wrinkled ' spots ) .
Peripheral smear will often show buttock cells .
STAGING
Section::::Staging .
Traditionally , mycosis fungoides has been divided into three stages : premycotic , mycotic and tumorous .
The premycotic stage clinically presents as an erythematous ( red ) , itchy , scaly lesion .
Microscopic appearance is non - diagnostic and represented by chronic nonspecific dermatosis associated with psoriasiform changes in epidermis .
In the mycotic stage , infiltrative plaques appear and biopsy shows a polymorphous inflammatory infiltrate in the dermis that contains small numbers of frankly atypical lymphoid cells .
These cells may line up individually along the epidermal basal layer .
The latter finding if unaccompanied by spongiosis is highly suggestive of mycosis fungoides .
In the tumorous stage a dense infiltrate of medium - sized lymphocytes with cerebroid nuclei expands the dermis .
PROGNOSIS Section::::Prognosis .
A 1999 US - based study of patient records observed a 5-year relative survival rate of 77 % , and a 10-year relative survival rate of 69 % .
After 11 years , the observed relative survival rate remained around 66 % .
Poorer survival is correlated with advanced age and black race .
Superior survival was observed for married women compared with other gender and marital - status groups .
TREATMENTS
Section::::Treatments .
Mycosis fungoides can be treated in a variety of ways .
Common treatments include simple sunlight , ultraviolet light ( mainly NB - UVB 312 nm ) , topical steroids , topical and systemic chemotherapies , local superficial radiotherapy , the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat , total skin electron radiation , photopheresis and systemic therapies ( e.g. interferons , retinoids , rexinoids ) or biological therapies .
Treatments are often used in combination .
There is limited evidence for the efficacy of topical and systemic therapies for mycosis fungoides .
Due to the possible adverse effects of these treatments in early disease it is recommended to begin therapy with topical and skin - directed treatments before progressing to more systemic therapies .
Larger and more extensive research is needed to identify effective treatment strategies for this disease .
In 2010 , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted orphan drug designation for naloxone lotion , a topical opioid receptor competitive antagonist used as a treatment for pruritus in cutaneous T - cell lymphoma .
EPIDEMIOLOGY Section::::Epidemiology .
It is rare for the disease to appear before age 20 , and it appears to be noticeably more common in males than females , especially over the age of 50 , where the incidence of the disease ( the risk per person in the population ) does increase .
The average age of onset is between 45 and 55 years of age for patients with patch and plaque disease only , but is over 60 for patients who present with tumours , erythroderma ( red skin ) or a leukemic form ( the Sézary syndrome ) .
The incidence of mycosis fungoides was seen to be increasing till the year 2000 in the United States , thought to be due to improvements in diagnostics .
However , the reported incidence of the disease has since then remained constant , suggesting another unknown reason for the jump seen before 2000 .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Mycosis fungoides was first described in 1806 by French dermatologist Jean - Louis - Marc Alibert .
The name mycosis fungoides is very misleading — it loosely means " mushroom - like fungal disease " .
The disease , however , is not a fungal infection but rather a type of non - Hodgkin 's lymphoma .
It was so named because Alibert described the skin tumors of a severe case as having a mushroom - like appearance .
RESEARCH Section::::Research .
Mogamulizumab has been under development for this condition , and of January 2018 was undergoing priority review at the FDA .
