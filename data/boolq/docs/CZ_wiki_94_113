VOTING
AT
THE EUROVISION SONG CONTEST
The winner of the Eurovision Song Contest is selected by a positional voting system .
Each country awards two sets of 12 , 10 , 8–1 points to their 10 favourite songs :
one from their professional jury and the other from televoting .
The current system has been in place since 2016 .
OVERVIEW Section::::Overview .
Small , demographically - balanced juries made up of ordinary people had been used to rank the entries , but after the widespread use of telephone voting in 1998 the contest organizers resorted to juries only in the event of a televoting malfunctions .
In 2003 , Eircom 's telephone polling system malfunctioned .
Irish broadcaster RTÉ did not receive the polling results from Eircom in time , and substituted votes by a panel of judges .
Between 1997 and 2003 ( the first years of televoting ) , lines were opened to the public for only five minutes after the performance and recap of the final song .
Between 2004 and 2006 the lines were opened for 10 minutes , and from 2007 to 2009 they were opened for 15 minutes .
In 2010 viewers were allowed to vote during the performances , but this was rescinded for the 2012 contest .
The BBC contacted regional juries by telephone to choose the 1956 winners , and the European Broadcasting Union ( producers of the contest ) later began contacting international juries by telephone .
This method continued to be used until 1993 .
The following year saw the first satellite linkup to juries .
To announce the votes , the contest 's presenters connect by satellite to each country in turn and inviting a spokesperson to read the country 's votes in French or English .
The presenters originally repeated the votes in both languages , but since 2004 the votes have been translated due to time constraints .
To offset increased voting time required by a larger number of participating countries , since 2006 only countries ' eight- , 10- , and 12-point scores are read aloud ; one- to seven - point votes are added automatically to the scoreboard while each country 's spokesperson is introduced .
The scoreboard displays the number of points each country has received and , since 2008 , a progress bar indicating the number of countries which have voted .
Since 2016 , only the 12-point score is read aloud due to the new voting system , meaning that the nine scoring countries were added automatically to the scoreboard ( 1 - 8 and 10 points ) .
In addition , the televoting points are combined together and the presenters announce them in order , starting from the country with the lowest score and ending with the country with the highest score from the televoting .

Voting system
Note :
The most - used voting system ( other than the current one ) was last used for the 1969 contest .
This system was used from 1957 to 1961 and from 1967 to 1969 .
Ten jurors in each country each cast one vote for their favourite song .
In 1969 this resulted in a four - way tie for first place ( between the UK , the Netherlands , France , and Spain ) , with no tie - breaking procedure .
A second round of voting in the event of a tie was introduced to this system the following year .
From 1962 to 1966 , a voting system similar to the current one was used .
In 1962 , each country awarded its top three one , two and three points ; in 1963 the top five were awarded one , two , three , four and five points , and from 1964 to 1966 , each country usually awarded its top three one , three and five points .
With the latter system , a country could choose to give points to two countries instead of three ( giving three to one and six to the other ) ; in 1965 , Belgium awarded the United Kingdom six points and Italy three .
Although it was possible to give one country nine points , this never occurred .
The 1971 , 1972 , and 1973 contests saw the jurors " in vision " for the first time .
Each country was represented by two jurors : one older than 25 and one younger , with at least ten years ' difference in their ages .
Each juror gave a minimum of one point and a maximum of five points to each song .
In 1974 the previous system of ten jurors was used , and the following year the current system was introduced .
Spokespeople were next seen on screen in 1994 with a satellite link to the venue .
The 2004 contest had its first semifinal , with a slight change in voting : countries which did not qualify from the semifinal would be allowed to cast votes in the final .
This resulted in Ukraine 's Ruslana finishing first , with a record 280 points .
If the voting had been conducted as it had been from 1956 to 2003 ( when only finalist countries could vote ) , Serbia and Montenegro 's Željko Joksimović would have won the contest with 190 points : a 15-point lead over Ruslana , who would have scored 175 points .
To date , non - qualifying countries are still allowed to vote in the final .
In 2006 , Serbia and Montenegro were able to vote in the semifinal and the final despite their non - participation due to a scandal in the selection process .
With the introduction of two semifinals in 2008 , a new method of selecting finalists was created .
The top nine songs ( ranked by televote ) qualified , along with one song selected by the back - up juries .
This method , in most cases , meant that the tenth song in the televoting failed to qualify ; this attracted some criticism , especially from Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ( who had placed 10th in the televote in both years ) .
In 2010 the 2009 final system was used , with a combination of televoting and jury votes from each country also used to select the semi - finalists .
Each participating country had a national jury , consisting of five music - industry professionals appointed by national broadcasters .
HIGHEST SCORES Section::::Highest scores .
" A Million Voices " sung by Russian artist Polina Gagarina , became the first song to get over 300 points without winning the contest ( and the only one during the era when each country delivered only one set of points ) ; with a new voting system introduced in 2016 , Australia became the first country to get over 500 points without winning the contest .
In 2017 , Bulgaria became the first non - winning entry to score above 600 points , as well as Portugal becoming the first country to get over 750 points - winning the contest as a result of this .
As the number of voting countries and the voting systems have varied , it may be more relevant to compare what percentage of all points awarded in the competition that each song received ( computed from the published scoreboards .
The table below show winning songs by the percentage of all votes .

TIE - BREAKERS Section::::Tie - breakers .
A tie - break procedure was implemented after the 1969 contest , in which France , the Netherlands , Spain and the United Kingdom tied for first place .
With no tie - breaking system in place at the time , it was determined that all four countries would be awarded the title ; in protest , Austria , Finland , Sweden , Norway and Portugal did not participate the following year .
In the procedure , sometimes known as a countback , if two ( or more ) countries tie , the song receiving points from the greater number of countries is the winner .
If there is still a tie , a second tie - breaker counts the number of countries who assigned twelve points to each entry in the tie .
Tie - breaks continue with ten points , eight points , and so on until the tie is resolved .
If the tie can not be resolved after the number of countries which assigned one point to the song is equal , the song performed earlier in the running order is declared the winner unless the host country performed earlier ( in which case the song performed later would be the winner ) .
This rule originally applied only to first place ties , but since 2008 has been applied to all places .
In 1991 , the tie - break procedure was implemented when Sweden and France both had 146 points at the end of the voting .
At the time , the tie - break rule was slightly different ; the first tie - break rule was not yet in use , and the current rule of first determining the country with the votes from the most countries was not added until 2003 .
Both Sweden and France had received the maximum twelve points four times ; when the number of ten - point scores was counted Sweden , represented by Carola and " Fångad av en
stormvind " , claimed its third victory since it received five ten - point scores against France 's two .
The French song " Le Dernier qui a parlé ... " , performed by Amina , finished second with the smallest - ever losing margin .
SCORING
NO POINTS Section::::Scoring no points .
As each participating country casts a series of preference votes , under the current scoring system it is rare that a song fails to receive any votes at all ; such a result means that the song failed to make the top ten most popular songs in any country .
The first zero points in Eurovision were scored in 1962 , under a new voting system .
When a country finishes with a score of zero , it is often referred to in English - language media as nul points or nil points , albeit incorrectly .
Grammatical French for " no points " is pas de points or zéro point , but none of these phrases are used in the contest ; before 2016 's voting overhaul , no - point scores were not announced by the presenters .
Following the change in the voting system , a country receiving no points from the public voting is announced as receiving " zero points " .

The Makemakes "
I Am Yours "
The first time a host nation ever finished with nul points was in the 2015 final , when Austria 's " I Am Yours " by The Makemakes scored zero .
In 2003 , following the UK 's first zero score , an online poll was held to determine public opinion about each zero - point entry 's worthiness of the score .
Spain 's " ¿ Quién maneja mi barca ? "
( 1983 ) won the poll as the song that least deserved a zero , and Austria 's " Lisa Mona Lisa " ( 1988 ) was the song most deserving of a zero .
In 2012 , although it scored in the combined voting , France 's " Echo ( You and I ) " by Anggun would have received no points if televoting alone had been used .
In that year 's first semi - final , although Belgium 's " Would You ? " by Iris received two points in the televoting - only hypothetical results from the Albanian jury ( since Albania did not use televoting ) ; Belgium would have received no official points from televoting alone .
In his book , Nul Points , comic writer Tim Moore interviews several of these performers about how their Eurovision score affected their careers .
Since the creation of a qualifying round ( semifinal ) in 2004 and an expansion to two semifinals in 2008 , more than thirty countries vote each night – even countries which have been eliminated or have already qualified .
No points are rarer ; it would require a song to place less than tenth in every country in jury voting and televote .

One section of voting .
With the new televoting system being introduced in the 2016 contest , scoring no points in either the jury voting or televoting phase is possible .
An overall " nul points " is possible , but much less likely , and has not yet happened .
In 2016 , the Czech Republic 's entry " I Stand " received no points from the televote .
They did get 41 points from juries .
In 2017 , Spain 's entry " Do It for Your Lover " received no points from the juries .
They did get 5 points from the televote .
Also in 2017 , Austria 's entry " Running on Air " received no points from the televote but they did get 93 points from juries .

" Our Choice " JUNIOR EUROVISION Section::::Junior Eurovision .
No entry in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest has ever received nul points ; between 2005 and 2015 , each contestant begins with 12 points to prevent such a result .
However , there has not been a situation that the 12 points received in the beginning would have remained as the sole points .
On 15 October 2012 , it was announced by the EBU , that for the first time in the contest 's history a new " " was being introduced into the voting system .
The jury consists of members aged between 10 and 15 , and representing each of the participating countries .
A spokesperson from the jury would then announce the points 1 - 8 , 10 and the maximum 12 as decided upon by the jury members .
In 2016 the Kids Jury was removed and instead , each country awarded 1 - 8 , 10 and 12 points from both adult and kid 's juries , also eliminating televoting from the contest .
An expert panel were also present at the 2016 contest , with each of the panelists being able to award 1 - 8 , 10 and 12 points themselves .
REGIONAL BLOC VOTING Section::::Regional bloc voting .
Although statistical analysis of the results from 2001 to 2005 suggests regional bloc voting ; it is debatable whether this is due to political alliances or a tendency for culturally - close countries to have similar musical tastes .
The United Kingdom and France would historically exchange points ( an average of 6.5 points per contest ) , and the UK has also had such a relationship with Ireland .
Several countries can be categorised as voting blocs , which regularly award one another high points : * Greece and Cyprus * Turkey and Azerbaijan * English - speaking countries or countries of the Commonwealth : Australia , Malta , Ireland and United Kingdom
*
The former Czechoslovakian countries : Czech Republic and Slovakia
* Austria , Germany and Switzerland
* The Netherlands and Belgium * Andorra , Portugal and Spain * The Nordic states : Sweden , Norway , Finland , Denmark , and Iceland * The Baltic states : Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania * Romania and Moldova , acting as a bridge between the Balkan and Warsaw Pact states *
The Balkan countries : Macedonia and Albania
The former Yugoslav countries : Serbia , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Slovenia , Montenegro , Macedonia , and Croatia
*
The former USSR countries of Belarus , Ukraine , Russia , Azerbaijan , Armenia , Georgia and Moldova * Hungary and Serbia
It is still common for countries to award points to their neighbours regularly , even if they are not part of a voting bloc ( for example , Finland and Estonia , Germany and Denmark , the Baltic states and Russia or Albania and Greece ) .
Votes may also be based on a diaspora .
Greece , Turkey , Poland , Russia and the former Yugoslav countries normally get high scores from Germany or the United Kingdom , Armenia gets votes from France and Belgium , Poland from Ireland , Romania from Spain and Italy and Albania from Switzerland , Italy and San Marino .
Former Eurovision TV director Bjørn Erichsen disagreed with the assertion that regional bloc voting significantly affects the contest 's outcome , saying that Russia 's first victory in 2008 was only possible with votes from thirty - eight of the participating countries .
In a recent study , , a new methodology is presented which allows a complete analysis of the competition from 1957 until 2017 .
The voting patterns change and the previous studies restrained their analysis to a particular time window where the voting scheme is homogeneous and this approach allows the sampling comparison over arbitrary periods consistent with the unbiased assumption of voting patterns .
This methodology also allows for a sliding time window to accumulate a degree of collusion over the years producing a weighted network .
The previous results are supported and the changes over time provide insight into the collusive behaviours given more or less choice .
