HISTORY Section::::History .
Visa requirements for British citizens were lifted by some European nations following World War II .
The first changes occurred in 1947 with visa restrictions for British citizens being removed by France on 1 January 1947 .
This was then quickly followed by Belgium on 15 February 1947 ,
Luxembourg 15 February 1947 , Norway on 1 March 1947 , Denmark on 22 March 1947 , Sweden on 1 April 1947 , Netherlands on 15 April 1947 , Switzerland on 24 June 1947 Liechtenstein on 24 June 1947 and Iceland on 1 July 1947 .
The following year , the requirement to obtain a visa in advance of travel was lifted by Italy on New Years Day , 1 January 1948 , Monaco ( 8 November 1948 ) , Austria ( 15 May 1955 ) , Paraguay ( 27 November 1966 ) , United States ( 1 July 1988 ) , Poland ( 1 July 1992 ) , Bulgaria ( March 1997 ) , Romania ( 1 January 2001 ) , Serbia and Montenegro ( 31 May 2003 ) , Ukraine ( 1 May 2005 ) , Georgia ( 1 June 2006 ) , Moldova ( 1 January 2007 ) , Kyrgyzstan ( 27 July 2012 ) , Armenia ( 10 January 2013 ) , Kazakhstan ( 15 July 2014 ) , Indonesia ( 13 June 2015 ) , Vietnam ( 1 July 2015 ) and Belarus ( 12 February 2017 ) .
Electronic visas for British citizens were introduced : India ( 15 August 2015 ) and Djibouti ( 18 February 2018 ) .
Visas on arrival were discontinued for British citizens by Mali ( March 2015 ) and Malawi ( 1 October 2015 ) ( was resumed ) .
However , Since 2016 with Brexit Referendum , the European Union most likely is that it is going to impose a reciprocal visa regime to the British citizens , if an agreement on the freedom of movement is not reached and between other subjects between both parts before the exit of United Kingdom from European Union on March 29 , 2019 and if UK decides impose a visa regime to European Union citizens after Brexit transition . .

TRAVEL IMPACT OF BREXIT Section::::Travel impact of Brexit .
Currently , when in a non - EU country where there is no British embassy , British citizens , like all other EU citizens , have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country .
See also List of diplomatic missions of the United Kingdom .
On 23 June 2016 , the British electorate voted to leave the European Union in a nationwide referendum in England , Scotland , Wales , Northern Ireland and Gibraltar .
The UK sent notification of their intention to leave the EU to the European Council through Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty .
After notifying the European Council , the UK has two years to negotiate with other member states until it leaves , and British citizens will only then cease to be citizens of the European Union .
British citizens will still have the right of freedom of movement until the UK formally leaves 29 March 2019 .
It has since been decided that citizens of non EU / Schengen countries wishing to travel to EU countries , if they do n't need a visa , have to apply online for ETIAS , an American style ESTA visa waiver and pay a fee , in order to enter the country of destination ..
This system was decided on 12 September 2018 and contains no exception for Britons .
This issue is a major topic of discussions taking place between the British government and all leaders of the 27 European Union countries during the two - year - long Brexit negotiations .
If an agreement between UK and EU is concluded it could contain an exception from ETIAS , but without such an agreement it is clear that ETIAS is needed .
