LIST OF WII GAMES WITH TRADITIONAL CONTROL SCHEMES
This is a list of released video games for the Wii video game consoles which allow use of Classic Controller / Classic Controller Pro and/or GameCube controller .
This list does not include games released on Nintendo 's Virtual Console as the Classic Controller and GameCube controller can also be used for all Virtual Console games , with the exception of some TurboGrafx-16 games .
Many of the games on this list are ports of prior generation games or games that were concurrently released on other consoles with traditional control schemes such as PlayStation 2 , 3 , and 4 and the Xbox 360 and One .
This list only applies if these games are played with the original version of the Wii console , as the newer , revised late 2011 Wii models are not backward - compatible with GameCube games and accessories , including the controller since the revised console lack the controller ports the original 2006 model had .
Like the revised Wii models , the Wii U does not include GameCube controller ports , but a USB peripheral , released in November 2014 , allows players to use GameCube controllers with Super Smash Bros. for Wii U.
This peripheral will not work for any other games .
The peripheral is also incompatible with GameCube controller compatible Virtual Console or Wii games playable on the Wii U.
