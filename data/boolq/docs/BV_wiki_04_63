HISTORY Section::::History .
The origins of the company lie in the industrial and transportation company , Preussag AG , which was originally formed as a German mining company .
It was incorporated on 9 October 1923 , as Preußische Bergwerks-
und Hütten - Aktiengesellschaft ( Prussian Mine and Foundry Company ) .
In 1927 it was merged with the Ruhr coal company , Hibernia AG , and electricity utility to become the Vereinigte Elekrizitäts und Bergwerks AG ( VEBA AG ) ( United Electrical and Mining Company ) .
With the sale of Salzgitter AG and purchase of the navigation and logistics company Hapag - Lloyd AG in 1997 , Preussag AG became a global enterprise in the service and leisure industry .
At that time , Hapag - Lloyd held a 30 % interest in the tourism conglomerate TUI ( founded 1968 ) , increased to 100 % by 1999 .
In addition the company acquired 25 % of Thomas Cook shares in 1997 , which it doubled the following year .
On 2 February 1999 , the Carlson Leisure Group merged with Thomas Cook into a holding company owned by the German bank , Westdeutsche Landesbank , Carlson Inc and Preussag .
However , in mid-2000 Preussag acquired Thomas Cook 's rival Thomson Travel and was forced to sell its majority 50.1 % stake in Thomas Cook by regulatory authorities .
In 2002 , Preussag renamed itself TUI AG .
TUI announced a merger of its travel division with the British tour operator First Choice in March 2007 , which was approved by the European Commission on 4 June 2007 , on the condition that the merged company sell Budget Travel in Ireland .
TUI held a 55 % stake in the new company , TUI Travel PLC , which began operations in September 2007 .
In April 2008 , Alexey Mordashov , who purchased his first shares in TUI Travel in autumn 2007 , purchased additional TUI Travel shares under S - Group in order to expand TUI Travel into Eastern Europe and Russia .
Its logistics activities , concentrated in the shipping sector , were kept separate and bundled within Hapag - Lloyd AG .
A majority stake in Hapag - Lloyd was sold to the Albert Ballin consortium of investors in March 2009 and a further stake was sold to Ballin in February 2012 , as TUI worked to exit from the shipping business and to optimize its tourism business with expansion in Russia , China and India under Michael Frenzel .
Prior to August 2010 , John Fredriksen held the largest Norwegian privately held stake in TUI Travel and had a significant influence upon TUI Travel 's direction and strategy .
As Alexey Mordashov through his S - Group Travel Holding increased his stake in TUI Travel to a stake larger than Fredriksen 's stake , the shipping business had to be sold .
In June 2014 the company announced it would fully merge with TUI Travel to create a united group with a value of $ US9.7 billion .
The merger was completed on 17 December 2014 and the combined business began trading on the Frankfurt and London stock exchanges .
Prior to this merger , Alexey Mordashov , the largest private shareholder in TUI Travel , held a blocking stake in TUI Travel through his S - Group .
After the merger , Alexey Mordashov 's stake was reduced to less than a blocking stake of 25 % .
On 12 December 2016 , Alexey Mordashov increased his stake in TUI Group from 18 % to more than 20 % .
In October 2018 , his 24.9 % stake is the largest privately held stake in TUI Group .
When Mordashov 's stake increases to 25 % , he will have a blocking stake in TUI Group at its annual meeting .
