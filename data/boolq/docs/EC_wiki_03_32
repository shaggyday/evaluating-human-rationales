When the hospital was created in 1893 , Parker Hill was a streetcar suburb considered far enough away from downtown Boston to provide fresh air and an escape from the noise and congestion of the city for patients who might benefit from long term rest and relaxation .

Even today it is a remarkably peaceful site considering its location near the center of one of the largest metropolitan areas in North America .
