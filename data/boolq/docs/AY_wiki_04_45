SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ( UNITED KINGDOM )
The Speaker of the House of Commons is the presiding officer of the House of Commons , the United Kingdom 's lower chamber of Parliament .
The office is currently held by John Bercow , who was initially elected on 22 June 2009 , following the resignation of Michael Martin .
He was returned as an MP in the 2010 general election and was re - elected as Speaker when the House sat at the start of the new parliament on 18 May 2010 .
He was again returned as an MP in the 2015 general election and was re - elected , unopposed , as Speaker when the House sat at the start of the new parliaments on 18 May 2015 and 13 June 2017 .
The Speaker presides over the House 's debates , determining which members may speak .
The Speaker is also responsible for maintaining order during debate , and may punish members who break the rules of the House .
Unlike presiding officers of legislatures in many other countries , the Speaker remains strictly non - partisan , and renounces all affiliation with his or her former political party when taking office as well as when leaving the office .
The Speaker does not take part in debate or vote ( except to break ties ; and even then , the convention is that the speaker casts the tie - breaking vote according to Speaker Denison 's rule ) .
Aside from duties relating to presiding over the House , the Speaker also performs administrative and procedural functions , and remains a constituency Member of Parliament ( MP ) .
The Speaker has the right and obligation to reside in Speaker 's House at the Palace of Westminster .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The office of Speaker is almost as old as Parliament itself .
The earliest year for which a presiding officer has been identified is 1258 , when Peter de Montfort presided over the Parliament held in Oxford .
Early presiding officers were known by the title parlour or prolocutor .
The continuous history of the office of Speaker is held to date from 1376 when Sir Peter de la Mare spoke for the commons in the " Good Parliament " as they joined leading magnates in purging the chief ministers of the Crown and the most unpopular members of the king 's household .
Edward III was frail and in seclusion , his prestigious eldest son , Edward the Black Prince , terminally ill .
It was left to the next son , a furious John of Gaunt , to fight back .
He arrested De la Mare and disgraced other leading critics .
In the next , " Bad Parliament " , in 1377 , a cowed Commons put forward Gaunt 's steward , Thomas Hungerford , as their spokesman in retracting their predecessors ' misdoings of the previous year .
Gaunt evidently wanted a ' mirror - image ' as his form of counter - coup and this notion , born in crisis , of one ' speaker ' , who quickly also became ' chairman ' and organiser of the Commons ' business , was recognised as valuable and took immediate root after 1376 - 7 .
On 6 October 1399 , Sir John Cheyne of Beckford ( Gloucester ) was elected speaker .
The powerful Archbishop of Canterbury , Thomas Arundel , is said to have voiced his fears of Cheyne 's reputation as a critic of the Church .
Eight days later , Cheyne resigned on grounds of ill - health , although he remained in favour with the king and active in public life for a further 14 years .
Although the officer was elected by the Commons at the start of each Parliament , with at least one contested election known , in 1420 ( Roger Hunt prevailing by a majority of just four votes ) , in practice the Crown was usually able to get whom it wanted , indicating that the famous ' defence of the Commons ' privilege ' should not be seen in isolation as the principal thread in the office 's evolution .
Whilst the idea of giving this spokesman personal immunity from recrimination as only being the voice of the whole body was quickly adopted and did enhance the Commons ' role , the Crown found it useful to have one person with the authority to select and lead the lower house 's business and responses to the Crown 's agenda , much more often than not in the way the Crown wanted .
Thus , Whig ideas of the Commons growing in authority as against royal power are somewhat simplistic – the Crown used the Commons as and when it found it advantageous to do so , and the speakership was part of the process of making the Commons a more cohesive , defined and effective instrument of the king 's government .
Throughout the medieval and early modern period , every speaker was an MP for a county , reflecting the implicit situation that such shire representatives were of greater standing in the house than the more numerous burgess MPs .
Although evidence is almost non - existent , it has been surmised that any vote was by count of head , but by the same token perhaps the fact so very little is said about actual votes suggests that most decisions , at least of a general kind , were reached more through persuasion and the weight by status of the county MPs .
In such a situation , the influence of the speaker should not be underestimated .
Sir Thomas More was the first speaker to go on to become Lord Chancellor .
Until the 17th century , members of the House of Commons often continued to view their Speaker ( correctly ) as an agent of the Crown .
As Parliament evolved , however , the Speaker 's position grew into one that involved more duties to the House than to the Crown ; such was definitely the case by the time of the English Civil War .
This change is sometimes said to be reflected by an incident in 1642 , when King Charles I entered the House in order to search for and arrest five members for high treason .
When the King asked him if he knew of the location of these members , the Speaker , William Lenthall , famously replied : " May it please your Majesty , I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place
but as the House is pleased to direct me , whose servant I am here . "
The development of Cabinet government under King William III in the late 17th century caused further change in the nature of the Speakership .
Speakers were generally associated with the ministry , and often held other government offices .
For example , Robert Harley served simultaneously as Speaker and as a Secretary of State between 1704 and 1705 .
The Speaker between 1728 and 1761 , Arthur Onslow , reduced ties with the government , though the office did remain to a large degree political .
The Speakership evolved into its modern form — in which the holder is an impartial and apolitical officer who does not belong to any party — only during the middle of the 19th century .
Over 150 individuals have served as Speaker of the House of Commons .
Their names are inscribed in gold leaf around the upper walls of Room C of the House of Commons Library .
The three most recent Speakers have been notable for a series of firsts .
Betty Boothroyd , elected in 1992 , was the first woman Speaker .
Michael Martin , elected in 2000 , was the first Roman Catholic Speaker since the Reformation .
John Bercow , elected in 2009 , is the first Jewish Speaker .
By convention , Speakers have traditionally been addressed in Parliament as " Mr Speaker " , and their deputies as " Mr Deputy Speaker " , regardless of their gender or their usual title .
Betty Boothroyd was , at her request , addressed as " Madam Speaker " .
When Betty Harvie Anderson served in the 1970s as a Deputy Speaker , on the other hand , she was addressed as " Mr Deputy Speaker " .
Eleanor Laing , a Deputy Speaker since 2013 , is addressed as " Madam Deputy Speaker " .
ELECTION Section::::Election .
MPs elect the Speaker from amongst their own ranks .
The House must elect a Speaker at the beginning of each new parliamentary term after a general election , or after the death or resignation of the incumbent .
Once elected , a Speaker continues in office until the dissolution of Parliament , unless he or she resigns prior to this .
Customarily , the House re - elects Speakers who desire to continue in office for more than one term .
Theoretically , the House could vote against re - electing a Speaker , but such an event is extremely unlikely .
The procedure for electing a Speaker has changed in recent years .
Until 1971 , the Clerk of the House of Commons became temporary Chairman of the House .
As the Clerk is never a Member , and therefore is not permitted to speak , he would silently stand and point at the Member who was to speak .
However , this procedure broke down at the election of a new Speaker in 1971 ( see below ) and had to be changed .
Since that time , as recommended by a Select Committee , the Father of the House ( the member of the House with the longest period of unbroken service who is not a Minister ) becomes the presiding officer .
Until 2001 , the election of a Speaker was conducted as a routine matter of House of Commons business , as it used motions and amendments to elect .
A member would move " That Mr(s )
[ X ] do take the Chair of this House as Speaker " , and following debate ( which may have included an amendment to replace the name of the member on whom the Speakership was to be conferred ) , a routine division of the House would resolve in favour of one candidate .
There was , however , a considerable amount of behind - the - scenes lobbying before suitable candidates were agreed upon , and so it was very rare for a new Speaker to be opposed .
However , this system broke down in 2000 when 12 rival candidates declared for the job and the debate occupied an entire Parliamentary day .
The House of Commons Procedure Committee then re - examined the means of electing a Speaker and recommended a new system that came into effect in 2007 and was first used in June 2009 , following the resignation of Michael Martin .
Under the new system , candidates must be nominated by at least twelve members , of whom at least three must be of a different party from the candidate .
Each member may nominate no more than one candidate .
The House then votes by secret ballot ; an absolute majority ( in the UK sense , i.e. more than 50 % of the votes cast ) is required for victory .
If no candidate wins a majority , then the individual with the fewest votes is eliminated , as are any other candidates who receive less than five percent of the votes cast .
The House continues to vote , for several rounds if necessary , until one member receives the requisite majority .
Then , the House votes on a formal motion to appoint the member in question to the Speakership .
( In the unlikely event that this motion fails , the House must hold a fresh series of ballots on all of the nominees . )
If only one candidate is nominated , then no ballot is held , and the House proceeds directly to the motion to appoint the candidate to the Speakership .
A similar procedure is used if a Speaker seeks a further term after a general election : no ballot is held , and the House immediately votes on a motion to re - elect the Speaker .
If the motion to re - elect the Speaker fails , candidates are nominated , and the House proceeds with voting ( as described above ) .
Upon the passage of the motion , the Speaker - elect is expected to show reluctance at being chosen ; he or she is customarily " dragged unwillingly " by MPs to the Speaker 's bench .
This custom has its roots in the Speaker 's original function of communicating the Commons ' opinions to the monarch .
Historically , the Speaker , representing the House to the Monarch , potentially faced the Monarch 's anger and therefore required some persuasion to accept the post .
Contrary to an often repeated tradition , no speaker has ever been executed for his actions in that capacity .
Six former speakers have been executed ( sometimes many years after their terms ) , five of which due to their close association with a former king after a new monarch had succeeded .
The Speaker - elect must receive approbation by the Sovereign , before he or she may take office .
On the day of the election , the Speaker - elect leads the Commons to the Chamber of the House of Lords , where Lords Commissioners appointed by the Crown confirm him or her in the monarch 's name .
Thereafter , the Speaker requests " in the name and on behalf of the Commons of the United Kingdom , to lay claim , by humble petition to Her Majesty , to all their ancient and undoubted rights and privileges , especially to freedom of speech in debate , to freedom from arrest , and to free access to Her Majesty whenever occasion shall require . "
After the Lords Commissioners , on the behalf of the Sovereign , confirm the Commons ' rights and privileges , the Commons return to their Chamber .
If a Speaker is chosen in the middle of a Parliament due to a vacancy in the office , he or she must receive the royal approbation as described above , but does not again lay claim to the Commons ' rights and privileges .
NOTABLE ELECTIONS Section::::Notable elections .
Though the election of a Speaker is normally non - partisan , there have been several controversial elections in history .
For example , in 1895 , the sudden retirement of Arthur Peel came at a time when partisan feelings were running high .
The Conservatives and Liberal Unionists put forward Sir Matthew White Ridley , a well - respected MP who had many years of experience , and hoped for a unanimous election as the previous Speaker had been a Liberal .
However , the Liberals decided to oppose him and nominated William Court Gully who had been an MP for only nine years and had been a relatively quiet presence .
On a party - line vote , Gully was chosen by 285 to 274 .
Although Gully proved his impartiality to the satisfaction of most of his opponents , and was unanimously re - elected after the 1895 general election , the episode left many Unionists bitter .
During that year 's general election , Gully became one of the few Speakers to be opposed in his own constituency , a sign of the bitterness of the time .
It was not until the mid-1930s that it became common for a Speaker to face some form of opposition for re - election .
The 1951 election was similarly controversial .
After the incumbent Speaker , Douglas Clifton Brown , retired at the 1951 general election , there was a great demand from the Labour Party for Major James Milner to become the first Labour Speaker after he had served as Deputy Speaker for eight years .
However , the Conservatives ( who had just regained power ) nominated William Shepherd Morrison against him .
The vote again went down party lines , and Morrison was elected .
Milner received a peerage as compensation .
In 1971 , having had early warning that Horace King would be retiring , the Conservatives took the lead in offering to the Labour Party either Selwyn Lloyd or John Boyd - Carpenter as potential Speakers .
The Labour Party chose Selwyn Lloyd , partly because he was perceived as a weak figure .
However , when the House of Commons debated the new Speaker , Conservative MP
Robin Maxwell - Hyslop and Labour MP Willie Hamilton nominated Geoffrey de Freitas , a senior and respected backbench Labour MP .
De Freitas was taken aback by the sudden nomination and urged the House not to support him ( a genuine feeling , unlike the feigned reluctance which all Speakers traditionally show ) .
Lloyd was elected , but there was a feeling among all parties that the system of election needed to be overhauled .
Now , a candidate 's consent is required before he or she can be nominated .
The last three instances of the election of a new Speaker ( 1992 , 2000 and 2009 ) have all been relatively controversial .
Bernard Weatherill had announced his impending retirement a long time before the 1992 general election , leading to a long but suppressed campaign for support .
Betty Boothroyd , a Labour MP who had been Deputy Speaker , was known to be extremely interested in becoming the first woman Speaker ( and in doing so , finished the chances of fellow Labour MP Harold Walker who had also been Deputy Speaker ) .
The Conservative former Cabinet member Peter Brooke was put forward at a late stage as a candidate .
Unlike previous elections , there was an active campaign among Conservative MPs to support Boothroyd and about 70 of them did so , ensuring her election .
She was the only speaker elected in the 20th century not to be a member of the governing party at the time of her first election .
Betty Boothroyd announced her retirement shortly before the summer recess in 2000 , which left a long time for would - be Speakers to declare their candidature but little opportunity for Members of Parliament to negotiate and decide on who should be chosen .
Many backbench Labour MPs advanced the claims of Michael Martin .
Most Conservatives felt strongly that the recent alternation between the main parties ought to be maintained and a Conservative Speaker chosen .
The most prominent Conservative choices were Sir George Young and Deputy Speaker Sir Alan Haselhurst .
With several additional candidates announcing themselves , the total number of Members seeking the Speakership was 14 , none of whom would withdraw .
A lengthy sitting of the House saw Michael Martin first proposed , then each of the other candidates proposed in turn as amendments , which were all voted down .
In points of order before the debate , many members demanded a secret ballot .
NON - PARTISANSHIP Section::::Non - partisanship .
By convention the Speaker severs all ties with his or her political party , as it is considered essential that the Speaker be seen as an impartial presiding officer .
In many cases , individuals have served in ministerial or other political positions before being elected Speaker .
For example , Selwyn Lloyd and George Thomas had both previously served as high - ranking Cabinet members , whilst Bernard Weatherill was previously a party whip .
In the House , the Speaker does not vote on any motion , except in order to resolve ties .
After leaving office , the Speaker normally takes no part in party politics ; if elevated to the House of Lords , he or she would normally sit as a crossbencher .
THE SPEAKER 'S SEAT IN PARLIAMENT Section::::The Speaker 's Seat in Parliament .
If the current Speaker decides to contest a general election , he / she does not stand under a party label , but is entitled to describe himself / herself on the ballot as " The Speaker seeking re - election " , under the Political Parties , Elections and Referendums Act .
In the past , the Speaker could sometimes be returned unopposed ; this has not happened in the last few decades , but they have sometimes faced opposition only from fringe candidates .
When Speaker Edward FitzRoy , previously a Conservative MP , was opposed by a Labour Party candidate at the 1935 general election , there was strong disapproval from other parties and a sub - committee of the Cabinet considered whether a special constituency should be created for the Speaker to remove the obligation to take part in electoral contests .
The sub - committee came to the conclusion that Parliamentary opinion would not favour this suggestion ; however , in December 1938 , with a general election expected within a year or so , a motion from the Prime Minister was put down to nominate a Select Committee to examine the suggestion .
The committee , chaired by former Prime Minister David Lloyd George , reported in April 1939 that no change should be made ; it found that preventing opposition to a sitting Speaker would be " a serious infringement of democratic principles " and that " to alter the status of the Speaker so that he ceased to be returned to the House of Commons by the same electoral methods as other members or as a representative of a Parliamentary constituency would be equally repugnant to the custom and tradition of the House " .
With the outbreak of the Second World War , no general election was held until 1945 .
More generally , the convention that major parties do not stand against the Speaker is not as firmly established as is sometimes suggested .
Generally , former Labour Speakers have faced only fringe candidates , but former Conservative Speakers have faced major party candidates .
The Labour and Liberal parties stood against Selwyn Lloyd in both elections in 1974 , and Labour and the SDP stood against Bernard Weatherill in 1987 .
Speakers who represented Scottish or Welsh constituencies have also faced nationalist opponents :
Plaid Cymru stood against George Thomas in 1979 , and the Scottish National Party stood against Michael Martin in 2001 and 2005 .
At the 2010 general election , Speaker John Bercow faced ten opponents , including Nigel Farage , former leader of UKIP , who obtained 17.4 % of the vote , and John Stevens , from the Buckinghamshire Campaign for Democracy party , who obtained 21.4 % .
Bercow won with 47 % of the vote .
ROLE PRESIDING OFFICER Section::::Role .
Section::::Presiding officer .
The Speaker 's primary function is to preside over the House of Commons .
Traditionally , the Speaker when presiding wore court dress — a black coat with white shirt and bands , beneath a black gown , with stockings and buckled shoes , and a full - bottomed wig .
But in 1992 Betty Boothroyd , the first female Speaker , eschewed the wig .
Her successor , Michael Martin , also declined to wear the wig ; moreover , he chose to simplify other aspects of the costume , doing away with the once customary buckled court shoes and silk stockings .
His successor John Bercow abandoned traditional dress , wearing a plain black gown over his lounge suit when presiding .
For ceremonial occasions such as the State Opening , the Speaker wears a black and gold robe with a train ; previously , this was worn over court dress with a white waterfall cravat , but the present Speaker wears plain morning dress .
Whilst presiding , the Speaker sits in a chair at the front of the House .
Traditionally , members supporting the Government sit on his or her right , and those supporting the Opposition on his or her left .
The Speaker 's powers are extensive — much more so than those of his or her Lords counterpart , the Lord Speaker .
Most importantly , the Speaker calls on members to speak ; no member may make a speech without the Speaker 's prior permission .
By custom , the Speaker alternates between members supporting the Government and those supporting the Opposition .
Members direct their speeches not to the whole House , but to the Speaker , using the words " Mister Speaker " or " Madam Speaker " .
Members must refer to each other in the third person by the name of their constituency or their ministerial titles ( not their names ) ; they may not directly address anyone other than the Speaker ( who does call them by name ) .
In order to remain neutral , the Speaker generally refrains from making speeches , although there is nothing to prevent him or her from doing so .
For example , on Wednesday 3 December 2008 , Speaker Martin addressed the House on the subject of the arrest of Damian Green MP and the subsequent searching of his office within the precincts of the House of Commons .
During debate , the Speaker is responsible for maintaining discipline and order .
He or she rules on all points of order ( objections made by members asserting that a rule of the House has been broken ) ; the decisions may not be appealed .
The Speaker bases decisions on the rules of the House and on precedent ; if necessary , he or she may consult with the Parliamentary Clerks before issuing a ruling .
In addition , the Speaker has other powers that he may use to maintain orderly debate .
Usually , the Speaker attempts to end a disruption , or " calls members to order " , by loudly repeating " ORDER ! ORDER ! " .
If members do not follow his or her instructions , the Speaker may punish them by demanding that they leave the House for the remainder of the day 's sitting .
For grave disobedience , the Speaker may " name " a member , by saying " I name [ Mr X ] . " ( deliberately breaching the convention that members are only referred to by reference to their constituency , " The [ Right ] Honourable Member for [ Y ] " ) .
The House may then vote to suspend the member " named " by the Speaker .
In case of " grave disorder " , the Speaker may immediately adjourn the entire sitting .
This power has been invoked on several occasions since it was conferred in 1902 .
In addition to maintaining discipline , the Speaker must ensure that debate proceeds smoothly .
If the Speaker finds that a member is making irrelevant remarks , is tediously repetitive , or is otherwise attempting to delay proceedings , he or she may order the member to end the speech .
Furthermore , before debate begins , the Speaker may invoke the " Short Speech " rule , under which he or she may set a time limit ( at least eight minutes ) , which will apply to every speech .
At the same time , however , the Speaker is charged with protecting the interests of the minority by ensuring sufficient debate before a vote .
Thus , the Speaker may disallow a closure , which seeks to end debate and immediately put the question to a vote , if he or she finds that the motion constitutes an abuse of the rules or breaches the rights of the minority .
Before the House votes on any issue , the Speaker " puts the question " ; that is , he or she orally states the motion on which the members are to vote .
He or she then assesses the result of a voice vote , but any member may demand a division ( a recorded vote ) .
The Speaker may overrule a request for a division and maintain the original ruling ; this power , however , is used only rarely , usually when members make frivolous requests for divisions in order to delay proceedings .
The Speaker does not vote in the division , except when the Ayes and Noes are tied , in which case he or she must use the casting vote .
In exercising the casting vote , the Speaker may theoretically vote as he or she pleases , but , in practice , always votes in accordance with certain unwritten conventions , such as Speaker Denison 's rule .
First , the Speaker votes to give the House further opportunity to debate a bill or motion before reaching a final decision .
( For example , the Speaker would be obliged to vote against a closure motion . )
Secondly , any final decision should be approved by the majority .
( Thus , for instance , the Speaker would vote against the final passage of a bill . )
Finally , the Speaker should vote to leave a bill or motion in its existing form ; in other words , the Speaker would vote against an amendment .
Since the House of Commons is a very large body , Speakers are rarely called upon to use the casting vote .
Since 1801 , there have been only 49 instances of tied divisions .
The last tied votes were on 30 January 1980 , when the House divided 201 - 201 on a motion to grant leave to bring the Televising of Parliament Bill ( the then Deputy Speaker Bernard Weatherill voted Aye ) and on 21 June 1990 , 197–197 on an Amendment of Law Relating to Termination of Pregnancy ( the Deputy Speaker Sir Paul Dean voted No ) .
There was believed to be a 317–317 vote on an amendment to a motion concerning the Maastricht Treaty in 1993 , but it was quickly discovered that one extra " Aye " vote had been erroneously counted .
Prior to the counting error having been noted , Speaker Betty Boothroyd did give a Casting Vote of No , although this was later expunged when the error became clear .
OTHER FUNCTIONS
Section::::Other functions .
In addition to his or her role as presiding officer , the Speaker performs several other functions on the behalf of the House of Commons .
He or she represents the body in relations with the Sovereign , the House of Lords , and non - parliamentary bodies .
On important occasions of state ( such as Queen Elizabeth II 's Golden Jubilee in 2002 ) , the Speaker presents Addresses to the Crown on behalf of the House .
The Speaker performs various procedural functions .
He or she may recall the House from recess during a national emergency , or when otherwise requested by the Government .
When vacancies arise , the Speaker authorises the issuance of writs of election .
Furthermore , the Speaker is responsible for certifying bills that relate solely to national taxation as " money bills " under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 .
The House of Lords has no power to block or substantially delay a money bill ; even if the Lords fail to pass the bill , it becomes law within a month of passage by the Commons .
The Speaker 's decision on the matter is final , and can not be challenged by the Upper House .
The Speaker is also responsible for overseeing the administration of the House .
He or she chairs the House of Commons Commission , a body that appoints staff , determines their salaries , and supervises the general administration of those who serve the House .
Furthermore , the Speaker controls the parts of the Palace of Westminster used by the House of Commons .
Also , the Speaker is the ex officio Chairman of the four boundary commissions ( for England , Wales , Scotland , and Northern Ireland ) , which are charged with redrawing the boundaries of parliamentary constituencies to reflect population changes .
However , the Speaker normally does not attend meetings of the boundary commissions ; instead , the Deputy Chairman of the Commission ( usually a judge ) normally presides .
Finally , the Speaker continues to represent his or her constituency in Parliament .
Like any other Member of Parliament , he or she responds to letters from constituents and attempts to address their concerns .
DEPUTIES Section::::Deputies .
The Speaker is assisted by three deputies , all of whom are elected by the House .
The most senior deputy is known as the Chairman of Ways and Means ; the title derives from the now defunct Ways and Means Committee which formerly considered taxation - related bills .
The remaining deputies are known as the First Deputy and Second Deputy Chairmen of Ways and Means .
Typically , the Speaker presides for only three hours each day ; for the remainder of the time , one of the deputies takes the Chair .
During the annual Budget , when the Chancellor of the Exchequer reads out the government 's spending proposal , the Chairman of Ways and Means , rather than the Speaker , presides .
Moreover , the Speaker never presides over the Committee of the Whole House , which , as its name suggests , consists of all the members , but operates under more flexible rules of debate .
( This device was used so that members could debate independently of the Speaker , who they suspected acted as an agent or spy of the monarch .
Now , the procedure is used to take advantage of the more flexible rules of debate . )
Deputies have the same powers as the Speaker when presiding .
Akin to the Speaker , they do not take part in partisan politics , and remain completely impartial in the House .
However , they are entitled to take part in constituency politics , and to make their views known on these matters .
In general elections , they stand as party politicians .
If a Deputy Speaker is presiding , then he or she holds the casting vote instead of the Speaker .
PRECEDENCE , SALARY , RESIDENCE AND PRIVILEGES Section::::Precedence , salary , residence and privileges .
The Speaker is one of the highest - ranking officials in the United Kingdom .
By an Order in Council issued in 1919 , the Speaker ranks in the order of precedence above all non - royal individuals except the Prime Minister , the Lord Chancellor , and the Lord President of the Council .
In England and Wales , he also ranks below the two archbishops of the Church of England , in Scotland , he also ranks below the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland , and in Northern Ireland , he also ranks below the Church of Ireland and Roman Catholic archbishops of Ireland , and the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church .
In 2010 , the Speaker received a salary of £ 145,492 , equal to that of a Cabinet Minister .
Speaker 's House , the official residence , is at the northeast corner of the Palace of Westminster and is used for official functions and meetings , with private accommodation in a four - bedroom apartment upstairs .
Each day , prior to the sitting of the House of Commons , the Speaker and other officials travel in procession from the apartments to the Chamber .
The procession includes the Doorkeeper , the Serjeant - at - Arms , the Speaker , a trainbearer , the Chaplain , and the Speaker 's Private Secretary .
The Serjeant - at - Arms attends the Speaker on other occasions , and in the House ; he or she bears a ceremonial mace that symbolises the royal authority under which the House meets , as well as the authority of the House of Commons itself .
Customarily , Speakers are appointed to the Privy Council upon election .
Thus , the present and former Speakers are entitled to the style " The Right Honourable " .
On retirement , Speakers were traditionally elevated to the House of Lords as viscounts .
The last Speaker to receive a viscountcy was George Thomas , who became Viscount Tonypandy on his retirement in 1983 .
Since that year , it has instead been normal to grant only life baronies to retiring Speakers .
SPEAKER 'S
CHAPLAIN Section::::Speaker 's Chaplain .
The post of chaplain to the Speaker has historically been held by a Canon Residentiary of Westminster Abbey ; in recent years , the post was held by the same canon who was also the Rector of St Margaret 's , Westminster ( Parliament 's parish church . )
In 2010 , Bercow appointed Rose Hudson - Wilkin , Vicar of Dalston and Haggerston as his chaplain ; she remains a vicar as well as Speaker 's Chaplain .
Hudson - Wilkin was the first chaplain appointed not to be a canon of Westminster .
OFFICIAL DRESS Section::::Official dress .
On normal sitting days , the Speaker wears a black silk lay - type gown ( similar to a Queen 's Counsel 's gown ) with ( or without , in the case of Bercow ) a train and a mourning rosette ( also known as a ' wig bag ' ) over the flap collar at the back .
On state occasions ( such as the Opening of Parliament ) , the Speaker wears a robe of black satin damask trimmed with gold lace and frogs with full bottomed wig and , in the past , a tricorne hat .
The current Speaker , John Bercow , no longer wears the traditional court dress outfit , which included knee breeches , silk stockings and buckled court shoes under the gown , or the wig .
Betty Boothroyd first decided not to wear the wig and Michael Martin chose not to wear knee breeches , silk stockings or the traditional buckled shoes , preferring flannel trousers and Oxford shoes .
Bercow chose not to wear court dress altogether in favour of a lounge suit , as he felt " uncomfortable " in court dress ( he wore morning dress under the State Robe at State Openings ) .
As seen at the 2015 State Opening of Parliament , Bercow further toned down the state robe by removing the gold frogging on the sleeves and train , so that it now resembles a pro - chancellor 's robe at certain universities .
However , he returned to wearing the traditional robe in 2016 .
