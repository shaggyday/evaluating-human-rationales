ST GEORGE 'S CHAPEL , WINDSOR CASTLE
St George 's Chapel at Windsor Castle in England , is a chapel designed in the high - medieval Gothic style .
It is both a Royal Peculiar , a church under the direct jurisdiction of the monarch , and the Chapel of the Order of the Garter .
Seating approximately 800 , it is located in the Lower Ward of the castle .
St. George 's castle chapel was established in the 14th century by King Edward III and began extensive enlargement in the late 15th century .
It has been the location of many royal ceremonies , weddings and burials .
Windsor Castle is a principal residence for Queen Elizabeth II .
The day - to - day running of the Chapel is the responsibility of the Dean and Canons of Windsor who make up the religious College of St George , which is directed by a Chapter of the Dean and four Canons , assisted by a Clerk , Virger ( traditional spelling of verger ) and other staff .
The Society of the Friends of St George 's and Descendants of the Knights of the Garter , a registered charity , was established in 1931 to assist the College in maintaining the Chapel .
HISTORY Section::::History .
In 1348 , King Edward III founded two new religious colleges :
St Stephen 's at Westminster and St George 's at Windsor .
The new college at Windsor was attached to the Chapel of St Edward the Confessor which had been constructed by Henry III in the early thirteenth century .
The chapel was then rededicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary , Edward the Confessor and George the Martyr .
Edward III also built the Aerary Porch in 1353–54 .
It was used as the entrance to the new college .
St George 's Chapel became the Mother Church of the Order of the Garter , and a special service is still held in the chapel every June and is attended by the members of the order .
Their heraldic banners hang above the upper stalls of the choir where they have a seat for life .
The period 1475–1528 saw a radical redevelopment of St George 's Chapel under the designs of King Henry VII 's most prized counsellor Sir Reginald Bray ( later Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster ) , set in motion by Edward IV and continued by Henry VII and Henry VIII .
The thirteenth - century Chapel of Edward the Confessor was expanded into a huge new Cathedral - like chapel under the supervision of Richard Beauchamp , Bishop of Salisbury , and the direction of the master mason Henry Janyns .
The Horseshoe Cloister was constructed for the new community of 45 junior members :
16 vicars , a deacon gospeller , 13 lay clerks , 2 clerks epistoler and 13 choristers .
The choristers of St George 's Chapel are still in existence to this day , although the total number is not fixed and is nearer to 20 .
The choristers are educated at St George 's School , Windsor Castle .
They are full boarders at the school .
In term time they attend practice in the castle every morning and sing Matins and Eucharist on Sundays and sing Evensong throughout the entire week , with the exception of Wednesdays .
St George 's Chapel was a popular destination for pilgrims during the late medieval period .
The chapel was purported to contain several important relics : the bodies of John Schorne and Henry VI and a fragment of the True Cross held in a reliquary called the Cross of Gneth .
These relics all appear to have been displayed at the east end of the south choir aisle .
The Chapel suffered a great deal of destruction during the English Civil War .
Parliamentary forces broke into and plundered the chapel and treasury on 23 October 1642 .
Further pillaging occurred in 1643 when the fifteenth - century chapter house was destroyed , lead was stripped off the chapel roofs , and elements of Henry VIII 's unfinished funeral monument were stolen .
Following his execution in 1649 , Charles I was buried in a small vault in the centre of the choir at St George 's Chapel which also contained the coffins of Henry VIII and Jane Seymour .
A programme of repair was undertaken at St George 's Chapel following the Restoration of the monarchy .
The reign of Queen Victoria saw further changes made to the architecture of the chapel .
The east end of the choir was reworked in devotion to Prince Albert ; the Lady Chapel , which had been abandoned by Henry VII , was completed ; a royal mausoleum was completed underneath the Lady Chapel ; and a set of steps were built at the west end of the chapel to create a ceremonial entrance to the building .
In the 21st century , St George 's accommodates approximately 800 persons for services and events .
QUEEN 'S
BEASTS
Section::::Queen 's Beasts .
On the roof of the chapel , standing on the pinnacles , and also on pinnacles on the sides , are seventy - six heraldic statues representing the Queen 's Beasts , showing the Royal supporters of England .
They represent fourteen of the heraldic animals : the lion of England , the red dragon of Wales , the panther of Jane Seymour , the falcon of York , the black bull of Clarence , the yale of Beaufort , the white lion of Mortimer , the greyhound of Richmond , the white hart of Richard II , the collared silver antelope of Bohun , the black dragon of Ulster , the white swan of Hereford , the unicorn of Edward III and the golden hind of Kent .
The original beasts dated from the sixteenth century , but were removed in 1682 on the advice of Sir Christopher Wren .
Wren had condemned the Reigate stone , the calcareous sandstone of which they were constructed .
The present statues date from 1925 , when the chapel was restored .
ORDER OF THE GARTER GARTER SERVICE Section::::Order of the Garter .
Section::::Garter Service .
Members of the Order of the Garter meet at Windsor Castle every June for the annual Garter Service .
After lunch in the State Apartments in the Upper Ward of the Castle they process on foot , wearing their robes and insignia , down to St George 's Chapel where the service is held .
If any new members have been admitted to the Order they are installed at the service .
After the service , the members of the order return to the Upper Ward by carriage or car .
The Order formerly had frequent services at the chapel , but , after becoming infrequent in the 18th century , they were discontinued in 1805 .
The ceremony was revived in 1948 by King George VI for the 600th anniversary of the founding of the Order , and has since become an annual event .
HERALDRY Section::::Heraldry .
After their installation , members are each assigned a stall in the chapel choir above which his or her heraldic devices are displayed .
A member 's sword is placed below a helm which is decorated with a mantling and topped by a crest , coronet or crown .
Above this , a member 's heraldic banner is flown emblazoned with his or her arms .
A Garter stall plate , a small elaborately enamelled plate of brass , is affixed to the back of the stall displaying its member 's name and arms with other inscriptions .
On a member 's death , the sword , helm , mantling , crest , coronet or crown , and banner are removed .
A ceremony marking the death of the late member must be held before the stall can be assigned to anyone else .
This ceremony takes place in the chapel , during which the Military Knights of Windsor carry the banner of the deceased member and offer it to the Dean of Windsor , who places it on the altar .
The stall plates , however , are not removed ; rather , they remain permanently affixed somewhere about the stall , so the stalls of the chapel are festooned with a colourful record of the members throughout history .
CHANTRIES Section::::Chantries .
St George 's Windsor is among the most important and ambitious medieval chantry foundations to have survived in England .
The college , itself a medieval chantry , also contains a number of independent chantries in the form of altars and small chapels dedicated to various members of the English monarchy and also to a number of prominent courtiers , deans and canons .
Masses , the Office and prayers would be offered in these chantries for the good of the founder .
Henry VIII had intended a chantry to be set up in the chapel , despite the fact that he instituted the religious changes which brought about the Reformation in England and the eventual suppression of chantries .
The much - admired iron gates in the sanctuary of the chapel as well as the locks on the doors of the chapel are the work of the medieval Cornish metalsmith John Tresilian .
The status of the college as a royal foundation saved it from dissolution at the Reformation .
As a result , many of the smaller chantries within the chapel were preserved .
These are the only remaining chantries of their kind in England which have never formally been suppressed .
RUTLAND CHANTRY Section::::Rutland Chantry .
The Rutland Chantry , forming the northern transept of St George 's Chapel , was founded in 1491 to honour Sir Thomas St Leger ( c.1440–1483 ) and Anne of York , Duchess of Exeter ( 1439–1476 ) ; Sir Thomas was Anne 's second husband .
She was the eldest surviving daughter of Richard Plantagenet , 3rd Duke of York , and thus elder sister of kings Edward IV ( 1442–1483 , reigned 1461–1483 ) and Richard III ( 1452–1485 , reigned 1483–1485 ) .
A monumental brass in memory of Anne of York and Sir Thomas survives on the east wall of the Rutland Chantry , the inscription of which records that the chantry was founded " with two priests singing forevermore " : " Wythin thys Chappell lyethe beryed Anne Duchess of Exetur suster unto the noble kyng Edward the forte .
And also the body of syr Thomas Sellynger knyght her husband which hathe funde within thys College a Chauntre with too prestys sy'gyng for ev'more .
On whose soule god have mercy .
The wych Anne duchess dyed in the yere of oure lorde M Thowsande CCCCl xxv "
The chantry received its current name in honour of the earls of Rutland , descendants of Anne and Sir Thomas ; their daughter , also named Anne , married George Manners , 11th Baron de Ros and gave birth to Thomas Manners , 1st Earl of Rutland .
The tomb of George and Anne Manners is a prominent feature of the chantry ; their effigies are carved in English alabaster .
