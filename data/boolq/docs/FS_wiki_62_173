SEASON 1
CREATION
Section::::Season 1 . Section::::Creation .
Naomi Clark was initially developed by the series ' original show - runner , Rob Thomas , who was succeeded by Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah prior to the premiere .
Early press releases described the character as a privileged , attractive , and popular teenager , prompting the media to draw comparisons to Kelly Taylor of Beverly Hills , 90210 , the first series of the franchise which launched 90210 .
As production of the spin - off began , the part would become more defined , with actress AnnaLynne McCord , who received the role , labeling Naomi an intelligent girl who possessed both manipulative and sensitive sides .
She further described the character as " kind of a chameleon " , stating that " she 'll be someone with the principal and then someone else with her mother and then someone else with her friend . "
Sachs also described Naomi as a layered character whose nature would be explored as the series progressed .
With regard to playing such roles , McCord stated , " I tend to reach out to people like Clark because I can see they are putting on a facade and are not as bad as they seem .
They will eventually let their guard down and become nice people .
" The actress opted not to review the original series before beginning her role in the spin - off , expressing a desire for Naomi to have her own identity .
Prior to being cast in 90210 , McCord had begun building a reputation for playing vixens and antiheroines , notably via the role of Eden Lord in the FX series Nip / Tuck .
After declining two offers to play Naomi , she eventually accepted in April 2008 , believing that her exposure on the show would help to benefit the charities she was involved in .
McCord was able to offer the creators her input on the character following her casting .
Additionally , she was the second performer and the first actress to be cast .

"
Staff members of the Fort Worth Star - Telegram found McCord 's performance " surprisingly more nuanced " than her previous work as Eden Lord .
The article also declared that Naomi appeared to be the most complex of the younger characters early on , labeling her a " popular but vulnerable but snotty but misunderstood but vindictive high - school queen .
