The area was created when a chain of volcanic islands collided with the North American plate .
The islands went over the North American plate and created the highlands of New Jersey .
Then around 450 million years ago , a small continent collided with proto North America and created folding and faulting in western New Jersey and the southern Appalachians .
When the African plate separated from North America , this created an aborted rift system or half - graben .
