Bella Cabakoff was born in Williamsburg , Brooklyn and moved to Columbus as a toddler .
At age 21 , she became the youngest buyer for the Lazarus department store chain .
After spending over 20 years working for Lazarus , in 1951 she and her husband Harry Wexner opened a women 's clothing store named Leslie 's ( after their son ) on State Street .
This store became the training ground for Leslie " Les " Wexner .
In 1963 , he borrowed $ 5,000 from his aunt and $ 5,000 from the bank and opened a store at the Kingsdale Shopping Center in Upper Arlington , Ohio .
This store was named " The Limited " because the store focused on clothing for younger women , unlike his parents ' general merchandise store .
Later in 1964 , Bella and Harry closed their store to join their son in his venture .
The original board consisted of only the three family members and longtime friend Jim Waldron , who served as Senior Vice President .
