LIST OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER MAIN EVENT CHAMPIONS
The following is the list of World Series of Poker Main Event champions .
The World Series of Poker ( WSOP ) is " the oldest , largest , most prestigious , and most media - hyped gaming competition in the world " .
It is held annually since 1970 in Las Vegas .
Since 1972 , the Main Event of the WSOP has been the $ 10,000 buy - in no - limit Texas Hold ' Em tournament .
The winner of the WSOP Main Event receives a World Series of Poker bracelet , millions of dollars ( with the exact amount based on the number of entrants ) , and the right to be considered the year 's World Champion of Poker .
From 2008 to 2016 , the nine players who made it to the final table of the Main Event were called the November Nine , a reference to the fact that the final table was completed in November , months after the Main Event 's preliminary rounds were completed .
Until 2005 , the WSOP was held at Binion 's Horseshoe .
In 2005 , the event moved to the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino .
The 2005 Main Event was not played completely at the Rio .
The final three tables , which comprised the final 27 players , played the conclusion of the event at Binion 's Horseshoe .
All of the Main Events that proceeded the 2005 event were played completely at the Rio .
Consequently , this made Joe Hachem the final player to win the Main Event at the original home of the World Series of Poker .

The World Series of Poker Europe ( WSOPE ) is the first expansion effort of World Series of Poker - branded poker tournaments outside the United States .
Since 1970 , the bracelet events have occurred every year in Las Vegas .
The inaugural WSOPE , held in 2007 , marked the first time that a WSOP bracelet was awarded outside Las Vegas .
The 2007 Main Event , a GBP 10,000 buy - in no - limit hold 'em tournament , was won by Norwegian player Annette Obrestad on the day before her 19th birthday .
This made her the youngest person to win a WSOP bracelet , a record that can not be broken in the Las Vegas WSOP under current laws because the minimum legal age for casino gaming in Nevada is 21 .
Obrestad could play in the WSOPE because the minimum age for casino gaming in the United Kingdom is 18 .
The World Series of Poker Europe has a unique identity from the Las Vegas WSOP , but according to Harrah 's will remain true to the traditions and heritage .
The 2011 WSOP Europe main event was an 8-handed event . ! class="unsortable

The first World Series of Poker was not a freeze out tournament , but rather a game with a set start and stop time .
Benny Binion took a secret ballot that asked the players who the best player was .
According to poker lore , everybody said that they were the best player .
Binion then asked who the second - best player was , and Johnny Moss won .
Chris Moneymaker won the entry into the WSOP Main Event via a $ 39 online satellite .
Joe Cada is the youngest person to have won the WSOP Main Event .
The final table at the 2008 WSOPE Main Event , was the longest final table in the WSOP history .
The tournament lasted 22 hours ( a WSOP record ) and 434 hands ( a WSOP record ) .
At the 2012 World Series of Poker Europe Main Event , Hellmuth won his record - breaking 13th bracelet .
This also made him the first player ever to win the Main Events at both the WSOP and WSOPE .
Hellmuth also holds the records for most WSOP cashes ( 100 ) and most WSOP final tables ( 53 ) .
Doyle Brunson obtained the nickname of Texas Dolly when Jimmy The Greek mispronounced his name .
In recent years , the prize pool for the WSOP Main Event has become so large that the winner instantly becomes one of the top money winners in tournament poker .
Jamie Gold ( 2006 ) is number eight on that list , Joe Hachem ( 2005 ) is number ten , and Peter Eastgate ( 2008 ) is number eleven .
The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 curtailed online gambling in the United States .
