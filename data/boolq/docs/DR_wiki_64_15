ENGLISH FOOTBALL LEAGUE PLAY - OFFS
The English Football League play - offs are an annual series of association football matches to determine the final promotion places within each division of the English Football League .
In each division it involves the four teams that finish directly below the automatic promotion places .
These teams meet in a series of play - off matches to determine the final team that will be promoted .
The play - offs were first introduced in 1987 and have been staged at the conclusion of every season since .
Since 1990 the winners of each division 's play - off competition have been determined in a one - off final .
Blackpool are the most successful club in play - off history , winning five times - 1992 , 2001 , 2007 , 2010 , and 2017 .
FORMAT Section::::Format .
The four teams finishing directly below the automatic promotion places in each of the three Football League divisions enter the play - offs in a chance to win promotion to the division above .
In the Championship and League One these are the teams finishing in third , fourth , fifth and sixth place , while in League Two ( with its greater number of teams automatically promoted ) , it is the teams finishing in fourth , fifth , sixth and seventh place that enter the play - offs .
The highest - finishing team of the four plays the team that finished lowest , with the first leg being held at the home of the team that finished lowest and the second leg being held at the home of the team that finished highest .
This is designed to give the team that finished higher an advantage .
This is the same for the teams that finished second highest and second lowest , with the advantage being with the team that finished the higher .
The winner of a semi - finals is decided by the tie 's aggregate score after the two legs .
If the aggregate score is level at the end of the 90 minutes of the second leg , then an additional 30 minutes of extra time is played to try to create a winning team .
If the score at the end of extra time is still level then the tie is decided by penalty kicks .
The two winners from the semi - finals meet at a neutral venue in the final .
The final must be decided on the day , so extra time and penalties may be carried out if the scores are level .
The winner of the tie gains promotion to the league above . CHANGES TO FORMAT Section::::Changes to format .
During the first two stagings of the play - offs in 1987 and 1988 , the four teams involved were the three clubs that finished directly below the automatic promotions positions , plus the club which finished directly above the automatic relegation places in the division above .
This was part of the league 's two - season - long restructuring that would reduce the number of teams in the top tier ( from 22 to 20 ) while increasing them in the lower divisions ( creating three divisions of 24 clubs ) ; during these seasons , only one club ( Charlton Athletic in 1987 ) that entered the play - offs in a relegation place managed to win the play - offs and therefore retain their divisional status .
In the seasons prior to the 1990 play - offs , the finals were two - legged ties with both teams hosting the other once .
If the two teams could not be separated , a tie - breaker was then staged at a neutral venue .
This was used on three occasions : the 1987 Second Division final was played at Birmingham City 's St. Andrews ; the 1987 Third Division final was played at Crystal Palace 's Selhurst Park ; and the 1988 Third Division final was played at Walsall 's Fellows Park ( though this was not strictly a neutral venue , as Walsall was one of the clubs involved ) .
Since 1990 a one - off final match has been used to determine the play - off winners , which has traditionally been staged at the old Wembley Stadium .
Between 2001 and 2006 the final was instead moved to Cardiff 's Millennium Stadium while the new Wembley Stadium was being constructed .
In 2011 the Football League was forced to use Old Trafford for the League One and League Two play - off finals because Wembley was unavailable , being used instead for the 2011 UEFA Champions League Final .
Before the 1999–2000 season away goals were used as a tie - breaker after extra time had been played , however , this was abolished following a club initiative launched by then - Ipswich Town chairman David Sheepshanks , after his club had twice lost on away goals in 1997 and 1999 .
Since then away goals have played no part in the play - off system .
PROPOSED CHANGES
Section::::Proposed changes .
A change to the format of the play - offs was proposed by Crystal Palace chief executive Phil Alexander in 2003 .
Alexander recommended expanding the number of teams in each play - off series from four to six , providing more clubs with a chance at promotion .
Additionally , the two - legged semi - finals would have been replaced by one - off quarter - final and semi - final games , both of which would give home advantage to the team that finished higher during the league season .
The two highest placed clubs in the play - off series would advance directly to the semi - final , while the other four clubs would contest the quarter - final .
The proposed changes were narrowly approved by Football League chairmen and were set to be voted upon at the league 's annual general meeting .
The motion was withdrawn however , due to objections received from the Premier League and The Football Association .
