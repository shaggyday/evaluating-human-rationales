ENGLISH - SPEAKING WORLD
Approximately 330 to 360 million people speak English as their first language .
With 258 million native speakers , the United States comprises the majority of the global total .
As pictured in the pie graph below , most native speakers of English are Americans .
Additionally , there are 60 million native English speakers in the United Kingdom , 19 million in Canada , 25.1 million in Australia , 4.8 million in Ireland , and 4.8 million in New Zealand .
Other countries also use English as their primary and official languages .
In the European Union , English is one of 24 official languages and is widely used by institutions and majority of population as native ( United Kingdom and Ireland ) and as a second language in other member states .
English is the third largest language by number of native speakers , after Mandarin and Spanish .
Estimates that include second language speakers vary greatly , from 470 million to more than 1 billion .
David Crystal calculates that , as of 2003 , non - native speakers outnumbered native speakers by a ratio of 3 to 1 .
When combining native and non - native speakers , English is the most widely spoken language worldwide .
Besides the major varieties of English , such as British English , American English , Canadian English , Australian English , Irish English , New Zealand English and their sub - varieties , countries such as South Africa , India , the Philippines , Jamaica and Nigeria also have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from English - based creole languages to Standard English .
India now claims to be the world 's second - largest English - speaking country .
The most reliable estimate is around 10 % of its population or 125 million people , second only to the US and expected to quadruple in the next decade .

COUNTRIES
WHERE ENGLISH IS AN OFFICIAL LANGUAGE Section::::Countries where English is an official language .
In some countries where English is not the most spoken language , it is an official language ; these countries include Botswana , Cameroon ( co - official with French ) , Eswatini ( Swaziland ) , Fiji , Ghana , Hong Kong , India , Kenya , Kiribati , Lesotho , Liberia , Malta , the Marshall Islands , Mauritius , the Federated States of Micronesia , Namibia , Nigeria , Pakistan , Palau , Papua New Guinea , the Philippines , Rwanda , Saint Lucia , Samoa , Seychelles , Sierra Leone , Singapore , the Solomon Islands , Sri Lanka , Sudan , South Africa , South Sudan , Tanzania , Uganda , Zambia and Zimbabwe .
There also are countries where in a part of the territory English became a co - official language , e.g. Colombia 's San Andr√©s y Providencia and Nicaragua 's Mosquito Coast .
This was a result of the influence of British colonization in the area .
India has the largest number of second - language speakers of English ( see Indian English ) ; Crystal ( 2004 ) claims that , combining native and non - native speakers , India has more people who speak or understand English than any other country in the world .
However , most scholars and research that has been conducted dispute his assertions .
English is one of the eleven official languages that are given equal status in South Africa ( South African English ) .
It is also the official language in current dependent territories of Australia ( Norfolk Island , Christmas Island and Cocos Island ) and of the United States ( American Samoa , Guam , Northern Mariana Islands , Puerto Rico ( in Puerto Rico , English is co - official with Spanish ) and the US Virgin Islands ) , and the former British colony of Hong Kong .
( See List of countries where English is an official language for more details . )
Although the United States federal government has no official languages , English has been given official status by 32 of the 50 US state governments .
Furthermore , per United States nationality law , the process of becoming a naturalized citizen of the US entails a basic English proficiency test , which may be the most prominent example of the claim of the nation not having an official language being belied by policy realities .
Although falling short of official status , English is also an important language in several former colonies and protectorates of the United Kingdom , such as Bahrain , Bangladesh , Brunei , Cyprus and the United Arab Emirates .
ENGLISH AS
A GLOBAL LANGUAGE Section::::English as a global language .
Because English is so widely spoken , it has often been referred to as a " world language " , the lingua franca of the modern era , and while it is not an official language in most countries , it is currently the language most often taught as a foreign language .
It is , by international treaty , the official language for aeronautical and maritime communications .
English is one of the official languages of the United Nations and many other international organizations , including the International Olympic Committee .
It is also one of two co - official languages for astronauts ( besides the Russian language ) serving on board the International Space Station .
English is studied most often in the European Union , and the perception of the usefulness of foreign languages among Europeans is 67 percent in favour of English ahead of 17 percent for German and 16 percent for French ( ) .
Among some of the non - English - speaking EU countries , the following percentages of the adult population claimed to be able to converse in English in 2012 :
90 percent in the Netherlands , 89 percent in Malta , 86 percent in Sweden and Denmark , 73 percent in Cyprus , Croatia , and Austria , 70 percent in Finland , and over 50 percent in Greece , Belgium , Luxembourg , Slovenia , and Germany .
In 2012 , excluding native speakers , 38 percent of Europeans consider that they can speak English .
Books , magazines , and newspapers written in English are available in many countries around the world , and English is the most commonly used language in the sciences with Science Citation Index reporting as early as 1997 that 95 % of its articles were written in English , even though only half of them came from authors in English - speaking countries .
In publishing , English literature predominates considerably with 28 percent of all books published in the world [ leclerc 2011 ] and 30 percent of web content in 2011 ( down from 50 percent in 2000 ) .
This increasing use of the English language globally has had a large impact on many other languages , leading to language shift and even language death , and to claims of linguistic imperialism .
English itself has become more open to language shift as multiple regional varieties feed back into the language as a whole .
