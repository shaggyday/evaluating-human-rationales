ACADEMIC GRADING IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
This is an article about the grading used below degree level in most of the United Kingdom .
The entire United Kingdom does not use the same grading scheme ( grades are referred to as marks ( points ) in the UK ) .
For a degree level , see British undergraduate degree classification .
ENGLAND , WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND Section::::England , Wales and Northern Ireland .
England , Wales and Northern Ireland use a unified system for grading secondary school qualifications .
Generally , the English and Welsh secondary school grading follows in line with the GCSE grades .
NATIONAL CURRICULUM ASSESSMENT Section::::National Curriculum Assessment .
In the compulsory state education system up to the age of 14 , assessment is usually carried out at periodic intervals against National Curriculum levels .
This is especially the case at the end of each Key Stage , at the ages of 7 , 11 and 14 , where students are statutorily assessed against these levels .
The levels are applied to each of the compulsory subjects , and range from Level 1 to Level 8 , with an additional band for ' Exceptional Performance ' .
The Department for Education states that students should be expected to reach a standard level at the end of each Key Stage .
These are stated as being Level 2 at age seven , Level 4 at age eleven , and then Level 5 at age twelve , and level 6c level 8a at age fourteen .
Children are expected to make two sub levels of progress per year , e.g. : average=4c in year 6 , whilst average in year 7=4b , year 8=5c and finally , year 9=5a .
GENERAL CERTIFICATE OF SECONDARY EDUCATION ( GCSE )
Section::::General Certificate of Secondary Education ( GCSE ) .
GCSEs are commonly studied from the age of 13/14 until the age of 16 , and are the second to last portion of mandatory qualifications .
As of 2018 , there are two concurrent GCSE grading systems .
In England , GCSEs are graded numerically from 1 ( lowest ) to 9 ( highest ) , with a 4 being considered a passing grade .
In Wales and Northern Ireland ( and in a few remaining subjects in England ) , a letter grade scale is used , with grades of A * ( highest ) , A , B , C , D , E , F and G
( lowest).In Northern Ireland , from 2019 , a new grade C * will be introduced , to line up with the English grade 5 .
In both systems , work below the grade G or 1 standard is denoted as ' Unclassified ' ( U ) .
For comparison purposes , a grade C is considered equivalent to a 4 , and an A is equivalent to a 7 .
Here is a comparison of the current and former GCSE grading systems , as well as the old O - Level and CSE grading systems : GCE ADVANCED LEVEL ( A - LEVEL )
Section::::GCE Advanced Level ( A - Level ) .
GCE Advanced Levels are post-16 qualifications in the United Kingdom , and are graded on a letter grade scale , from highest to lowest :
A * , A , B , C , D ,
E. As in GCSE , there is an ' Unclassified ' ( U ) grade below the minimum standard required for a grade E.
The A * grade was introduced in 2010 .
Previously an intermediate N ( Nearly passed ) grade was awarded for papers below grade E by a very small margin ( not used since 2008 ) .
Advanced Subsidiary Levels ( AS - Levels ) , considered to be worth 40 % of an A - Level ( 50 % of an A - Level before 2017 ) , are graded on a similar scale , but do not have an A * grade .
INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION YEAR Section::::International Foundation Year .
International Foundation Year ( 2015 + ) is graded on a 7-point scale of A , A− , B+ , B− , C+ , C− , D , F. ( F meaning Failed or not acceptable ) .
2014–2015 grades :
* A – Pass * B – Pass * C – Pass * D –
Pass / Fail ( depending on course )
* E –
Pass / Fail ( depending on course )
* F – Fail SCOTLAND
Section::::Scotland .
Scotland 's education system uses the following structure : Some children take National 4 or National 5 in their 4th year / S4 at high school ( aged about 14/15 ) .
In some schools , if children are in top set in S3 ( aged 13/14 ) they will study the Nat 5 course
but they do not take the exams .
National 4/5 are thought to be preparation for the Highers & Advanced Highers .
If you are taking your national 4 you most likely will take the national 5 exams next year .
STANDARD GRADE Section::::Standard Grade .
Standard Grade , Intermediate 1 and Intermediate 2 courses are no longer available in Scottish schools and have been replaced by National 4 and National 5 awards .
NATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS Section::::National qualifications .
Advanced Highers

* B :
Above average grade , very good ( around 60–70 % )

* D : Close fail ( between 40 % and 49 % ) * N /
A :
Fail / No Pass ( 0–40 % )

National 4
The National 4 award is not graded and is only pass or fail .
Each grade is further sub - divided into ' bands ' .
The A grade comprises bands 1 and 2 , the B grade has bands 3 and 4 , and so on .
These bands are not shown on certificates issued by the SQA and do not need to be stated on CVs .
The National 4 Grading is equivalent to Standard Grade General , while national 5 Grading is equivalent to Standard Grade Credit .
Highers remain at the same level as the previous grading under the same name , and Advanced Highers are equivalent to the old CSYS ( Certificate of Sixth Year Studies ) .
Percentage pass marks for each grade change from year to year depending on performance levels .
NATIONAL COURSES
* A : best possible grade , excellent ( around 75 % and above )
* B : above average grade , very good ( around 65 % and above )
* C : below average grade , improvement needed ( around 55 % and above )
* D : almost pass ( around 45–50 % ) * No Award : Less than 45 % REFERENCES
