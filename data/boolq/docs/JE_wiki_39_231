The twenty - six produced specimens are sent to farmers in different locations around the world , and ten years later , one of them will be crowned the winner of a competition to breed the best pig .
In 2017 , a young girl named Mija lives in South Korea with her grandfather and their super pig , Okja .
They are visited by Mirando spokesperson and zoologist Dr. Johnny Wilcox , who declares Okja the best super pig and announces they will take her to New York City .
Mija 's grandfather presents her with a gold pig and explains to her that he saved up money to buy the solid gold item to replace Okja when she was taken away .
Devastated , Mija runs away to Seoul to find Okja , where she sees her as she is being loaded onto a truck .
Mija chases down the truck but it is intercepted by the Animal Liberation Front ( ALF ) .
In the resulting chaos , Mija and Okja run away but are eventually saved by the ALF , led by Jay .

Mija tells them to return her to the mountains but K tells the group that Mija is in agreement with their plan .
They abandon her , and Okja is recaptured .
To minimise the PR damage to the company , Lucy pays for Mija to come to New York to be reunited with her pig .
