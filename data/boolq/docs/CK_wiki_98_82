AIR - COOLED ENGINE Air - cooled engines rely on the circulation of air directly over hot parts of the engine to cool them .
INTRODUCTION Section::::Introduction .
Most modern internal combustion engines are cooled by a closed circuit carrying liquid coolant through channels in the engine block and cylinder head , where the coolant absorbs heat , to a heat exchanger or radiator where the coolant releases heat into the air ( or raw water , in the case of marine engines ) .
Thus , while they are not ultimately cooled by the liquid , because of the liquid - coolant circuit they are known as water - cooled .
In contrast , heat generated by an air - cooled engine is released directly into the air .
Typically this is facilitated with metal fins covering the outside of the Cylinder Head and cylinders which increase the surface area that air can act on .
Air may be force fed with the use of a fan and shroud to achieve efficient cooling with high volumes of air or simply by natural air flow with well designed and angled fins .
In all combustion engines , a great percentage of the heat generated ( around 44 % ) escapes through the exhaust , not through either a liquid cooling system nor through the metal fins of an air - cooled engine ( 12 % ) .
About 8 % of the heat energy finds its way into the oil , which although primarily meant for lubrication , also plays a role in heat dissipation via a cooler .

VEHICLES Section::::Applications .
Section::::Road vehicles .
Many motorcycles use air cooling for the sake of reducing weight and complexity .
Few current production automobiles have air - cooled engines ( such as Tatra 815 ) , but historically it was common for many high - volume vehicles .
Examples of past air - cooled road vehicles , in roughly chronological order , include : * Franklin ( 1902 - 1934 ) * New Way ( 1905 ) - limited production run out from the " CLARKMOBILE " * GM " copper - cooled " models of Chevrolet , Olds , and Oakland ( 1921 - 1923 )
( very few built )
* Tatra all - wheel - drive military trucks .
* Tatra 11 ( 1923 - 1927 ) and subsequent models
* Tatra T77 ( 1934 - 1938 )

The 350cc and 500cc Twinspark motorcycle engines are air - cooled AVIATION Section::::Aviation .
Most aviation piston engines are air - cooled .
While water cooled engines were widely used from the early days of flight , air cooled engines were the dominant choice in aircraft .
Following the Second World War , turbojets and jet turbine powered aircraft have come to dominate flight regimes where water cooled piston engines offered the advantage of reduced drag .
Today , piston engines are mostly used in slower general aviation aircraft where the greater drag produced by air cooled engines is not a major disadvantage .
Therefore , most aero engines produced today are of the air cooled variety .
Today , most of the engines currently ( 2005 ) manufactured by Lycoming and Continental and used by major manufacturers of light aircraft Cirrus , Cessna and so on .
Notable exceptions have included the Allison V-1710 and Rolls - Royce series of ( most well known , the Merlin V-1650 ) liquid - cooled V12 engines which powered P-51 Mustangs , Avro Lancasters , Hawker Hurricanes and Spitfires .
Other engine manufactures using air - cooled engine technology are ULPower and Jabiru , more active in the Light - Sport Aircraft ( LSA ) and ultralight aircraft market .
Rotax uses a combination of air - cooled cylinders and liquid - cooled cylinder heads .
DIESEL ENGINES Section::::Diesel engines .
Some small diesel engines , e.g. those made by Deutz AG and Lister Petter are air - cooled .
Probably the only big Euro 5 truck air - cooled engine ( V8 320 kW power 2100 N·m torque one ) is being produced by Tatra .
STATIONARY OR PORTABLE ENGINES Section::::Stationary or portable engines .
Stationary or portable engines were commercially introduced early in the 1900s .
The first commercial production was by the New Way Motor Company of Lansing , Michigan , US .
The company produced air - cooled engines in single and twin cylinders in both horizontal and vertical cylinder format .
Subsequent to their initial production which was exported worldwide , other companies took up the advantages of this cooling method , especially in small portable engines .
Applications include mowers , generators , outboard motors , pump sets , saw benches and auxiliary power plants and more .
