EARLY LIFE
Section::::Early life .
Williams was born Otis Miles , Jr. in Texarkana , Texas to Otis Miles and Hazel Louise Williams , an unmarried couple who separated shortly after their son 's birth .
While he was still a toddler , his mother married and moved to Detroit , Michigan , leaving the younger Otis Miles to be raised by both of his grandmothers in Texarkana .
Hazel Williams moved her son to Detroit when he was ten years old , where he lived with his mother and his stepfather .
CAREER Section::::Career .
Becoming interested in music as a teenager , Otis Miles , Jr. adopted his mother 's maiden name for his stage name , and as Otis Williams put together a number of singing groups .
These groups included Otis Williams and the Siberians , the El Domingoes and the Distants .
In 1959 , The Distants scored a local hit , co - written by Williams and their manager / producer Johnnie Mae Matthews , called " Come On " , with lead vocals by Richard Street .
Future Distants recordings were not as successful , and after an offer from Berry Gordy of Motown Records , Williams and his friends / bandmates Elbridge " Al " Bryant and Melvin Franklin quit the Distants .
Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams from The Primes later joined Williams , Bryant , and Franklin to create the Elgins , who signed to Motown in March 1961 as " The Temptations " .
The Temptations eventually became one of the most successful acts in black music over the course of its nearly five - decade existence , over which time notable singers such as David Ruffin , Dennis Edwards , former Distant Richard Street , Damon Harris , Ron Tyson , Ali - Ollie Woodson , Theo Peoples , Ray Davis and former Spinners singer G.C. Cameron have all been members .
In fact , the group 's lineup changes were so frequent , stressful and troublesome that Williams and Melvin Franklin promised each other they would never quit the group .
Franklin would remain in the group until 1994 , when he became physically incapable of continuing .
Franklin died on February 23 , 1995 , leaving Otis Williams , then 53 , as the last surviving original member of the Temptations quintet .
Williams is the co - author , with Patricia Romanowski , of Temptations , a 1988 book that served as both his autobiography and a history of the group .
Ten years later , the book was adapted into a NBC television miniseries The Temptations .
Williams was portrayed by actor Charles Malik Whitfield .
Although he has served the longest tenure in the Temptations , Williams rarely sings lead , focusing instead on his role as the group 's leader and organizer , and as the background " baritone in the middle " .
