MID - LEVEL PRACTITIONER Mid - level practitioners , also called assistant practice clinicians , are health care providers who have received different training and have a more restricted scope of practice than physicians and other health professionals in some states , but who do have a formal certificate and accreditation through the licensing bodies in their jurisdictions .
Advanced Practice Provider ( APP ) is a term which Nurse Practitioners , Nurse Anesthetists , Physician Assistants , Clinical Nurse Specialists , and Nurse Midwives often prefer for themselves rather than"Mid - level provider " .
The terms " Mid - level provider " or " Mid - level practitioners " have been widely accepted for many years however and are commonly used by most physicians as well as by the Federal Government of the United States .
Many providers simply prefer their professional title , such as nurse practitioner ( NP ) or physician assistant ( PA ) .
Because of their diverse histories , a multitude of mid - level health worker categories can be found in different countries under different titles .
Their training , functions , scope of practice , regulation , and integration into the formal health system vary from country to country .
Mid - level practitioners have many different titles , e.g. physician assistant , clinical officer , or nurse practitioner .
They are increasingly being used to render services autonomously , particularly in rural and remote areas , to make up for physician shortages .

Section::::South Africa .
In 2008 , a new mid - level practitioner role was introduced in South Africa , known as clinical associates .
The role was intended to support the district hospital workforce .
UNITED KINGDOM Section::::United Kingdom . Mid - level practitioners in the UK are known as ' Advanced Clinical Practitioners ' ( ACP ) and is an evolution of many differing professions which use various titles such as ' Extended Scope Practitioner ' or ' Advanced Practitioner ' .
Historically there has been debate over the consistency of quality in these senior clinicians and therefore it became necessary to generate a distinguished definition of the ACP role .
The ACP :
* Is a registered healthcare practitioner with a minimum of 5 years clinical experience ( 2 years in a senior clinical role )
* Has acquired expert knowledge and complex decision making skills which may be an extension of their traditional scope of practice *
Will undertake a two - year level 7 ( Master 's degree ) training course in Advanced Practice * Will maintain training and CPD requirements
This is an emerging role and is showing a good deal of promise in meeting the demands of the UK 's rapidly evolving healthcare requirements .
ACPs may practice in the acute setting ( ED , critical care , medical or surgical wards ) or community General Practice / family medicine .
The majority can independently assess , investigate ( through blood science / imaging / labs etc . ) , diagnose and formulate a treatment including prescribing medications or referring to specialist care .
The deployment of ACPs is considered to be part of a Value Based Recruitment framework driven by Health Education England ( HEE ) .
This seeks to appoint clinicians based upon their competencies , values and behaviours in support of collaborative working and delivering excellent patient care .
UNITED STATES Section::::United States .
In the United States , mid - level practitioner is a term used to describe the category of health care workers with training less than that of a physician but greater than that of more ordinary nurses and other medical assistants .
In recent years some organizations and specialties have proposed the discontinuance of the term mid level in reference to professional practitioners who are not physicians .
This shift follows a change in paradigm toward a collaborative team based care model .
Other groups such as the American Academy of Family Physicians considers the term to be appropriate as it delineates a clear distinction between the training and expertise of physicians and non - physicians , and considers the term " providers " that encompasses both physicians and non - physicians to be derogatory .
The term mid - level practitioner or mid - level provider related to the occupational closure of healthcare .
This concept centered around physicians as the ultimate professional responsible for healthcare .
As healthcare demands have increased in the United States due to an aging population , a physician shortage and the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 there has been a shift toward more independence in practice for professionals such as advanced practice nurses , pharmacists , dentists , podiatrists , dental therapists and physician assistants who were previously described as part of this category .
As an example of a shift away from the US Medicare system terms both advanced practice nurses and physician assistants as " non - physician practitioner " ( NPP ) .
Medicare will pay for emergency department services when these services meet the critical care services definition and requirements .
CONTROVERSY Section::::Controversy .
The American Academy of Nurse Practitioners ( AANP ) released a position statement in 2009 , updated in 2010 , 2013 and 2015 denouncing the use of several relegating terminology .
Terms such as " mid - level provider , " " physician extender , " " limited license provider , " " non - physician provider , " and " allied health provider " when referring to nurse practitioners are considered derogatory by the AANP .
The American Academy of Nurse Practitioners prefers that nurse practitioners are referred to as " Nurse Practitioners , " " independently licensed providers , " " primary - care providers , " " health - care professionals , " and " clinicians . "
in reference to the legal and professional paradigm that nursing practice is considered separate and independent of other licensed professionals .
DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION Section::::Drug Enforcement Administration .
The term mid - level practitioner as found in the DEA classification in Section 1300.01(b28 ) , Title 21 , of the Code of Federal Regulations is not a health care designation and must not be confused with the term as it is defined above .

The term mid - level practitioner as used by the DEA Office of Diversion Control include clinicians , other than a physician , dentist , veterinarian , or podiatrist , who are licensed , registered , or otherwise permitted to dispense a controlled substance in the course of professional practice .
