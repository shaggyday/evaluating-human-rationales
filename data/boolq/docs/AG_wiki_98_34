TRIVIAL PURSUIT Trivial Pursuit is a board game from Canada in which winning is determined by a player 's ability to answer general knowledge and popular culture questions .
Dozens of question sets have been released for the game .
The question cards are organized into themes ; for instance , in the standard Genus question set , questions in green deal with science and nature .
Some question sets have been designed for younger players , and others for a specific time period or as promotional tie - ins ( such as Star Wars , Saturday Night Live , and The Lord of the Rings movies ) .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The game was created on December 15 , 1979 in Montreal in Quebec , by Canadian Chris Haney , a photo editor for Montreal 's The Gazette , and Scott Abbott , a sports editor for The Canadian Press .
After finding pieces of their Scrabble game missing , they decided to create their own game .
With the help of John Haney and Ed Werner , they completed development of the game , which was released in 1981 .
In North America , the game 's popularity peaked in 1984 , a year in which over 20 million games were sold .
The rights to the game were initially licensed to Selchow and Righter in 1982 , then to Parker Brothers ( now part of Hasbro ) in 1988 , after initially being turned down by the Virgin Group ; in 2008 Hasbro bought the full rights , for US$ 80 million . , nearly 88 million games had been sold in 26 countries and 17 languages .

GAMEPLAY
Section::::Gameplay .
The object of the game is to move around the board by correctly answering trivia questions .
Questions are split into six categories , with each one having its own color to readily identify itself ; in the classic version of Trivial Pursuit , these are Geography ( blue ) , Entertainment ( pink ) , History ( yellow ) , Arts & Literature ( originally brown , later purple ) , Science & Nature ( green ) , and Sports & Leisure ( orange ) .
The game includes a board , playing pieces , question cards , a box , small plastic wedges to fit into the playing pieces , and a die .
Playing pieces used in Trivial Pursuit are round and divided into six sections , similar to a cheese triangle .
A small plastic wedge , sometimes called cheese , can be placed into each of these sections to mark each player 's progress .
During the game , players move their playing pieces around a track which is shaped like a wheel with six spokes .
This track is divided into spaces of different colors , and the center of the board is a hexagonal " hub " space .
At the end of each spoke is a " category headquarters " space .
When a player 's counter lands on a square , the player answers a question according to the color of the square , which corresponds to one of the six categories .
If the player answers the question correctly , his turn continues ; if the player 's piece was on one of the category headquarters spaces , he / she collect a wedge of the same color , which fits into the playing piece .
Some spaces say " roll again , " giving an extra roll of the die to the player .
The hub is a " wild " space ; a player landing here may answer a question in the category of his choice .
Questions must be answered without any outside assistance .
Any number of playing pieces may occupy the same space at the same time .
A variant rule ends a player 's turn on collecting a wedge , preventing a single knowledgeable player from running the board .
Once a player has collected one wedge of each color and filled up his playing piece , he must return to the hub and answer a question in a category selected by the other players .
If this question is answered correctly , that player wins the game .
Otherwise , the player must leave the center of the board and try again on the next turn .
EDITIONS Section::::Editions .
Over the years , numerous editions of Trivial Pursuit have been produced , usually specializing in various fields .
The original version is known as the Genus edition ( or Genus I ) .
Several other general knowledge editions ( such as Genus II ) have followed .
Some include , Junior Edition ( 1985 ) , All - Star Sports , Baby Boomers , 1980s ,
All About the 80s , and 1990s .
In the United Kingdom , Trivial Pursuit players complained that the 2006 version of the game was " dumbed down " in comparison to previous editions , with easier questions and more focus on celebrities and show business .
LEGAL ACTION
FRED WORTH
LAWSUIT Section::::Legal action .
Section::::Fred Worth lawsuit .
In October 1984 , Fred L. Worth , author of The Trivia Encyclopedia , Super Trivia , and Super Trivia II , filed a $ 300 million lawsuit against the distributors of Trivial Pursuit .
He claimed that more than a quarter of the questions in the game 's Genus Edition had been taken from his books , even to the point of reproducing typographical errors and deliberately placed misinformation .
One of the questions in Trivial Pursuit was " What was Columbo 's first name ? "
with the answer " Philip " .
That information had been fabricated to catch anyone who might try to violate his copyright .
The inventors of Trivial Pursuit acknowledged that Worth 's books were among their sources , but argued that this was not improper and that facts are not protected by copyright .
The district court judge agreed , ruling in favor of the Trivial Pursuit inventors .
The decision was appealed , and in September 1987 the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the ruling .
Worth asked the Supreme Court of the United States to review the case , but the Court declined , denying certiorari in March 1988 .
DAVID WALL
LAWSUIT
Section::::David Wall lawsuit .
In 1994 , David Wall of Cape Breton , Nova Scotia , launched a lawsuit against the game 's creators .
He claimed that in the fall of 1979 , he and a friend were hitchhiking near Sydney , Nova Scotia , when they were picked up by Chris Haney .
Wall claimed that he told Haney about his idea for the game in detail , including the shape of the markers .
Wall 's mother testified she found drawings of his that looked like plans for a Trivial Pursuit - like game , but the drawings had since been destroyed .
Wall 's friend , who was allegedly hitchhiking with him that day , never testified .
Haney said he never met Wall .
Over the years , there was much legal wrangling , notably around whether the suit should be decided by a judge or jury .
On June 25 , 2007 , the Nova Scotia Supreme Court ruled against Wall .
