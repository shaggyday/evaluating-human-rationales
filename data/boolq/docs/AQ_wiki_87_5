HISTORY Section::::History .
The first Boston Marathon included only 15 runners , all of whom were men .
Women were only officially allowed to run the race beginning in 1972 , though female runners had unofficially participated beginning in 1966 despite the opposition of the Boston Athletic Association , the race sponsor .
The Boston Marathon became the first major marathon to include a wheelchair division , in 1975 .
Subsequently , in 1977 , the Wheelchair division was bifurcated to allow for both a Men 's and a Women 's division .
Many marathon champions have repeated their feats in following years .
The record for most repeated championships stands at 10 , held by Ernst van Dyk in the Men 's Wheelchair division .
In the Men 's Open division , Clarence DeMar holds the distinction of most wins with seven .
Catherine Ndereba tops the Women 's Open division with four , while Jean Driscoll has won 8 races in the Women 's Wheelchair division .
The United States has had more winners than any other country , followed by Kenya and Canada .
The United States and Canada dominated the early years of the race , and it was not until the 36th race , in 1932 , that someone from outside North America , Paul de Bruyn of Germany , won the race .
During the period from World War II through the 1980s , there was much more national diversity among Boston Marathon champions , but the last two decades have seen Kenya emerge as the dominant nationality , especially in the Men 's Open division , which ( as of 2015 ) has been won by Kenyans in 19 of the past 25 years .
The length of the marathon was not fixed before the 1924 Paris Olympics , and the Boston course varied as well .
Prior to 1924 the course distance was approximately .
Even after the standardization of marathon lengths , the Boston course was off by nearly 200 yards from the correct distance until the mistake was discovered and corrected in 1927 .
The course grew gradually shorter in the 1950s as road reconstruction straightened curves .
This time , upon remeasurement , the course was found to lack nearly 1200 yards , and this was corrected beginning with the 1957 race .
Due to these changes , the marathon recognizes several course records that are slower than previous records due to being run on longer courses .
26 world records have been set on the Boston Marathon course , one in the Men 's Open Division , two in the Women 's Open , 13 in the Men 's Wheelchair , and 10 in the Women 's Wheelchair .
On April 18 , 2011 , Geoffrey Mutai of Kenya ran the fastest marathon ever run up to that point , in a time of 2:03:02 .
