PLOT Section::::Plot .
At a large financial services firm in New York City , an executive named Lockhart is sent by the company board of directors to retrieve Roland Pembroke , the company 's CEO who had abruptly decided to stay at a " wellness center " in the Swiss Alps .
The board needs Pembroke to sign off on an upcoming merger .
The company is being investigated for criminal misconduct , and several self - serving partners hope to place all of the blame squarely upon Pembroke .
Lockhart arrives at the spa , but he is met with resistance by the staff and Dr. Heinreich Volmer in attempting to speak with Pembroke .
Lockhart leaves but is involved in a car accident and supposedly awakens three days later at the center with his leg in a plaster cast .
Curiously , in spite of the truly horrendous nature of the accident , both he and the driver suffer from no other injuries but a minor scratch or two .
During his time at the spa , Lockhart meets a mysterious young girl named Hannah , who , among others , doses herself with a mysterious fluid kept in a small , cobalt - colored bottle .
A patient named Victoria Watkins , as well as residents of the nearby town , regale a fascinated Lockhart with the history of the spa .
It was built on the ruins of a castle once owned by a baron roughly 200 years ago .
The baron desired an heir of pure blood and married his sister .
When the baron learned she was infertile , he began performing hellish experiments on the peasants to find a cure for her infertility .
He succeeded , but after finding the carelessly buried bodies of his victims , the peasants stormed the castle and set it on fire .
The baron 's pregnant sister was captured by the peasants and the baby was cut from her womb before she was burned .
Although the peasants tossed the baby into the local aquifer , it somehow survived .
Lockhart attempts to escape the center but finds that no one is allowed to leave .
After gifting Hannah a ballerina figurine , Lockhart bikes into town with her help .
Lockhart leaves Hannah in a bar and seeks out a translator for Pembroke 's German - language medical dossier .
He finds out that the people of the spa suffer from dehydration despite the quantities of water they imbibe from the aquifer .
Meanwhile , Hannah , who has been kept at the spa her entire life , explores the bar and attracts the attention of the locals .
Lockhart returns and gets into a fight with a man who was dancing with Hannah .
He is rescued by Dr. Volmer , who has discovered that Lockhart had left the spa with Hannah .
Everyone in the place is curiously cowed by Dr. Volmer .
Lockhart investigates his suspicions and discovers the transfusion wing of the spa is a front for macabre medical experiments .
The water from the local aquifer possesses unique properties .
It is very toxic to humans but has life restoring properties for the eels living in the water .
The baron had devised a process to filter the water through the bodies of humans and distill it into a life giving essence .
Volmer uses the patients as filters for this process .
This " cure " is ingested by Hannah , Volmer , and his staff in order to gain vastly lengthened lifespans .
Lockhart also realizes that his leg is n't broken and that he is being forcefully kept prisoner there .
Volmer then subjects Lockhart to nightmarish treatments that warp his mind until he believes he is insane .
Hannah perceives this change and gives Lockhart back the ballerina figurine .
This act helps to break him out of his delirium .
Around this time , Hannah has her first menstruation , and Volmer marries her .
During the reception , he leads Hannah to a secret room built in the ruins of the castle and begins to sexually assault her .
When Lockhart confronts Volmer he realizes that Volmer is the baron and Hannah is his daughter , the baby who was thrown into the well .
They both had been aging very slowly due to the " cure " .
In the ensuing fight , Volmer 's face is revealed to be a mask that hides his hideous burns .
Lockhart sets Volmer and the castle on fire but is overpowered by Volmer all the same .
Hannah saves Lockhart by killing her father , who falls backwards into the aquifer and is eaten by the furiously voracious eels .
Lockhart and Hannah escape from the premises on her bicycle as fire engulfs the structure .
Not far down the road , Lockhart crashes into a car carrying his employers .
They have arrived from New York to retrieve him and Pembroke .
Lockhart tells his employers that Pembroke died .
Lockhart is ordered into the car by the employers .
Lockhart looks at Hannah and can not abandon her .
He chooses to ride away with Hannah , smiling as he finally escapes the asylum .

CRITICAL RESPONSE
Section::::Critical response .
A Cure for Wellness received mixed reviews from critics , with praise for its visuals , performances and ambition , but criticism for its length , plot and structure .
Critics have noted the film 's Lovecraftian elements .
On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 41 % based on 182 reviews , with an average rating of 5.3/10 .
The site 's critical consensus reads , " A Cure for Wellness boasts a surfeit of visual style , but it 's wasted on a derivative and predictable story whose twists , turns , and frights have all been more effectively dealt before . "
On Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating to reviews , the film has a score of 47 out of 100 , based on 40 critics , indicating " mixed or average reviews " .
Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of " C+ " on an A+ to F scale .
A.O. Scott of The New York Times compared the film to works by Martin Scorsese and Guillermo Del Toro , adding : " It 's all in good fun , really , though two and a half hours may be more of this kind of fun than a body can stand .
You might feel like you 're in the company of a manic cinephile friend breathlessly recounting his favorite movie scenes in no particular order .
You admire his devotion , his taste and his scholarship , but in the end the experience is probably more satisfying for him than it is for you . "
Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film 's first hour " sustains a creepy , clammy tension that draws you along without quite accelerating into outright terror , " but concluding : " The terrors we see in A Cure for Wellness are never as scary as they are beautiful , but they are never so beautiful as they are arbitrary . "
The New Republics Josephine Livingstone criticized the film 's conclusion : " The poor ending is a great shame .
For Verbinski calls upon a great pantheon of stories in order to talk about daddy issues , yes , but more importantly to talk about capitalism .
In the movie , two strains of moneymaking compete .
Financial services go up against the wellness industry in a fully binaristic duel : city versus mountaintop , suit versus white coat , aggression versus docility .
Both industries exploit those they profit from , and A Cure for Wellness is at its best when showing how contemporary philosophies of " health and wealth " are , at base , all the same old sin . "
Moira Macdonald of The Seattle Times was critical of the film 's runtime , noting : " If Verbinski could have trimmed about an hour from the film ( which weighs in at a portly 146 minutes ) , he might have had something ...
[ it ] looks terrific — clearly money was spent on production values , which is always a pleasant surprise in a non - franchise film ...
And the first half of the film nicely creates a squirmy , elegant tension .
"
Tim Holland of TV Guide awarded the film three out of five stars , writing : Writing for TheWrap , Alonso Duralde praised the film 's production design but criticized its narrative , saying : " While the movie is about people who are happy to remain removed from the world , not realizing that they are involved in something truly dreadful , many viewers will be all too willing to head for the exits .
