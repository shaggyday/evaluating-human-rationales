BRAZIL VS CHILE Section::::Round of 16 .
Section::::Brazil vs Chile .
The two teams had met in 68 previous matches , including three times in the FIFA World Cup knockout stage , all won by Brazil ( 1962 , semi - finals : 4–2 ; 1998 , round of 16 : 4–1 ; 2010 , round of 16 : 3–0 ) .
Brazil opened the scoring when from a corner when David Luiz turned Thiago Silva 's flick - on into the net with his thigh .
While replays suggested that Chilean defender Gonzalo Jara may have had the last touch , FIFA later confirmed that the goal was scored by Luiz , not Jara .
Chile equalised when Hulk lost possession after a throw - in in his own half , Eduardo Vargas stole the ball and passed to Alexis Sánchez to score .
In the second half , Hulk 's goal was disallowed as Howard Webb adjudged that the player used his arm in bringing down the ball and gave him a yellow card instead .
Chances were few after that with Brazil dominating possession with Hulk forcing Claudio Bravo into a decent save , and the match went to extra time .
The best chance of extra time came in the last seconds as Mauricio Pinilla 's shot hit the crossbar .
In the resulting penalty shootout , the score was tied 2–2 after four rounds , with Brazil goalkeeper Júlio César saving from Pinilla and Sánchez , while Willian missed and Hulk 's shot was saved by Bravo .
In the fifth round , Neymar scored his penalty , meaning Chile had to score , but Jara 's shot hit the inside of the post .
Brazil advanced to the quarter - finals to face Colombia .
The result meant that in all four World Cups where Chile qualified for the knockout stage , they were eliminated by Brazil .

The two teams had met in five previous matches , including one in the 1930 FIFA World Cup group stage won by United States 3–0 and which was one of the two first FIFA World Cup matches to be played .
An unofficial friendly between the two teams was scheduled on 12 June 2014 in São Paulo , but was cancelled because of traffic due to the opening ceremony and match .
Belgium midfielder Steven Defour was suspended for the match , after being sent off in the last group stage match against South Korea .
In a game dominated by the Belgians , but still goalless through the first 90 minutes thanks to U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard , U.S. striker Chris Wondolowski missed a great chance in stoppage time from less than five yards out .
Thus , the game went to extra time and Belgium took the lead within two minutes .
Romelu Lukaku , who came off the bench at the start of extra time , crossed from the right into the penalty area , Matt Besler failed to clear the ball , and Kevin De Bruyne shot low into the far corner from the right of the penalty area .
Near the end of extra time first half , De Bruyne 's through ball from the right set up Lukaku to extend the lead with a left footed shot to the net .
The United States pulled one back early in extra time second half , when substitute Julian Green volleyed in Michael Bradley 's lobbed pass with his right foot from near the penalty spot .
Minutes later , the U.S. nearly equalised on a set piece routine that saw Clint Dempsey through on goal , but his first touch was too hard and the ball was corralled by Belgian goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois .
Belgium held on for the win , and advanced to the quarter - finals to face Argentina .
With Belgium 's victory , the 2014 World Cup became the first tournament where all the top teams of the group stage advanced to the quarter - finals .
U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard recorded 15 saves in the match , which was the most saves recorded in a match since FIFA started to keep track of the number of saves in 1966 .
Julian Green also became the youngest player to score a goal in the 2014 FIFA World Cup .

Section::::Brazil vs Germany .
The two teams had met in 21 previous matches , including in the final of the 2002 FIFA World Cup ( their only previous encounter in the tournament 's history ) , won by Brazil 2–0 .
While Germany kept the same starting line - up as their quarter - final against France , Brazil made two changes : defender and captain Thiago Silva was suspended for the match due to accumulation of yellow cards , and was replaced by Dante , while forward Neymar was sidelined after suffering a fractured vertebra in the quarter - final against Colombia , and was replaced by Bernard .
Germany took the lead in the 11th minute , Thomas Müller volleying in Toni Kroos 's corner .
Miroslav Klose scored Germany 's second goal , after a passing move saw him set up by Kroos , his first shot was saved by Brazil goalkeeper Júlio César , but he slotted in the rebound .
Kroos then scored two quick goals in succession , the first one after Philipp Lahm 's cross was missed by Müller , the second one after stealing the ball from Fernandinho and playing a quick one - two with Sami Khedira .
Khedira then scored Germany 's fourth goal in six minutes , after exchanging passes with Mesut Özil , to give Germany a 5–0 halftime lead .
Substitute André Schürrle added two more goals in the second half , first slotting in from Lahm 's cross , then scoring via the crossbar after a cut - back from Müller .
Brazil scored a consolation goal in the 90th minute , as Oscar received a pass from Marcelo , dribbled inside and scored .
Germany reached their eighth World Cup final , a record by any nation , where they would face Argentina , while Brazil had to settle for the third - place play - off against the Netherlands .
The game equalled Brazil 's biggest margin of defeat , a 6–0 loss to Uruguay in 1920 , and it broke a 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to the 1975 Copa América , where they lost 3–1 to Peru in the same exact stadium of this match .
The match also broke many World Cup records : It was Brazil 's biggest World Cup defeat ( eclipsing their 1998 final loss to France ) , the biggest defeat by a World Cup host nation ( previous record was by three goals ) , and the biggest margin of victory in a World Cup semi - final ( three previous semi - finals ended in 6–1 scorelines ) .
Klose 's goal was his 16th overall throughout his World Cup appearances , allowing him to beat Ronaldo for the record of all - time top scorer in World Cup finals tournaments .
Germany 's seven goals took their total tally in World Cup history to 223 , surpassing Brazil 's 221 goals to first place overall .

THIRD PLACE PLAY - OFF Section::::Third place play - off .
The two teams had met in 11 previous meetings , including four times in the FIFA World Cup : Netherlands won 2–0 in the second group stage of the 1974 FIFA World Cup and 2–1 in the quarter - finals of the 2010 FIFA World Cup , and Brazil won 3–2 in the quarter - finals of the 1994 FIFA World Cup and 4–2 on penalties after a 1–1 draw ( after extra time ) in the semi - finals of the 1998 FIFA World Cup .
Brazil made six changes in their starting line - up from their semi - final , while the Netherlands made only two , with Wesley Sneijder , who was originally part of the Dutch starting line - up , replaced by Jonathan de Guzmán after an injury during the pre - match warm - up prevented him from playing .
The Netherlands opened the scoring within three minutes , after Robin van Persie converted a penalty kick awarded for a foul on Arjen Robben by Thiago Silva .
Daley Blind extended the lead in the 17th minute , scoring after a David Luiz headed clearance fell to him inside the penalty area .
Georginio Wijnaldum completed the scoring in second half injury time as he shot home from substitute Daryl Janmaat 's cross from the right .
The Netherlands finished third for the first time in their World Cup history .
With Michel Vorm 's participation ( who was substituted into the match in second half injury time ) , the Netherlands became the first team to use all of their 23 players in a World Cup since the finals squads were expanded from 22 to 23 players in 2002 .
Brazil , who finished fourth for the second time in World Cup history , conceded a total of 14 goals in the tournament , the most they had ever allowed in a World Cup and also the most conceded by any World Cup hosts .
Brazil also became the second team to concede 100 World Cup goals , after Germany .
Van Persie 's goal was the 100th goal that Brazil have conceded in the FIFA World Cup and made him the 2nd highest Dutch goalscorer with 6 World Cup goals along with Wesley Sneijder , Arjen Robben , Dennis Bergkamp , and Rob Rensenbrink , all before Johnny Rep with 7 World Cup goals .
Lastly , since the beginning of the 21st century of the World Cups ( first one being in 2002 ) , all four World Cups in 2002 , 2006 , 2010 , and 2014 involved the third - place victors all winning a third - place match with 3 goals .
