PLOT Section::::Plot .
Andrew Beckett is a senior associate at the largest corporate law firm in Philadelphia .
He hides his homosexuality and his status as an AIDS patient from the other members of the firm .
A partner in the firm notices a lesion on Beckett 's forehead .
Although Beckett attributes the lesion to a racquetball injury , it indicates Kaposi 's sarcoma , an AIDS - defining condition .
Shortly thereafter , Beckett stays home from work for several days to try to find a way to hide his lesions .
While at home , he finishes the paperwork for a case he has been assigned and then brings it to his office , leaving instructions for his assistants to file the paperwork the following day , which marks the end of the statute of limitations for the case .
Later that morning , he receives a call asking for the paperwork , as the paper copy can not be found and there are no copies on the computer 's hard drive .
The paperwork is finally discovered in an alternate location and is filed with the court at the last possible moment .
The following day , Beckett is dismissed by the firm 's partners .
Beckett believes that someone deliberately hid his paperwork to give the firm an excuse to fire him , and that the dismissal is actually as a result of his diagnosis with AIDS .
He asks several attorneys to take his case , including African - American personal injury lawyer Joe Miller .
The homophobic Miller appears to be worried that he could contract Beckett 's illness .
After declining to take the case , Miller immediately visits his doctor to find out if he could have contracted the disease .
The doctor explains that the routes of HIV infection do not include casual contact .
Unable to find a lawyer willing to represent him , Beckett is compelled to act as his own attorney .
While researching a case at a law library , Miller sees Beckett at a nearby table .
A librarian approaches Beckett and announces that he has found a book on AIDS discrimination for him .
As others in the library begin to first stare uneasily , the librarian suggests Beckett to go to a private room .
Feeling discouraged by the other people 's behavior and seeing the parallels in how he himself has faced discrimination due to his race , Miller approaches Beckett , reviews the material he has gathered , and takes the case .
As the case goes before the court , the partners of the firm take the stand , each claiming that Beckett was incompetent and that he had deliberately tried to hide his condition .
The defense repeatedly suggests that Beckett brought AIDS upon himself by having gay sex , and is therefore not a victim .
In the course of testimony , it is revealed that the partner who had noticed Beckett 's lesion , Walter Kenton , had previously worked with a woman who had contracted AIDS after a blood transfusion and so should have recognized the lesion as relating to AIDS .
According to that partner , the woman was an innocent victim , unlike Beckett , and further testified that he did not recognize Beckett 's lesions .
To prove that the lesions would have been visible , Miller asks Beckett to unbutton his shirt while on the witness stand , revealing that his lesions are indeed visible and recognizable as such .
Beckett eventually collapses during the trial .
After Beckett is hospitalized , another partner , Bob Seidman , who noticed Beckett 's lesions confesses that he suspected Beckett had AIDS but never told anyone and never gave him the opportunity to explain himself , which he regretted very much .
During his hospitalization , the jury votes in Beckett 's favor , awarding him back pay , damages for pain and suffering and punitive damages , totaling over $ 5 million .
Miller visits the visibly failing Beckett in the hospital after the verdict and overcomes his fear enough to touch Beckett 's face .
After Beckett 's family leaves the room , he tells his partner Miguel that he is ready to die .
At the Miller home , Joe and his wife are awakened by a phone call from Miguel , who tells them that Beckett has died .
A memorial is held at Beckett 's home following the funeral , where many mourners , including Miller , view home movies of Beckett as a happy child .

Section::::Inspiration .
The events in the film are similar to the events in the lives of attorneys Geoffrey Bowers and Clarence B. Cain .
Bowers was an attorney who in 1987 sued the law firm Baker McKenzie for wrongful dismissal in one of the first AIDS discrimination cases .
Cain was an attorney for Hyatt Legal Services who was fired after his employer found out he had AIDS .
He sued Hyatt in 1990 and won just before his death .
CONTROVERSY Section::::Controversy .
Bowers ' family sued the writers and producers .
A year after Bowers ' death , producer Scott Rudin interviewed the Bowers family and their lawyers and , according to the family , promised compensation for the use of Bowers ' story as a basis for the film .
Family members asserted that 54 scenes in the movie are so similar to events in Bowers 's life that some of them could only have come from their interviews .
However , the defense said that Rudin abandoned the project after hiring a writer and did not share any information the family had provided .
The lawsuit was settled after five days of testimony .
Although terms of the agreement were not released , the defendants did admit that " the film ' was inspired in part ' " by Bowers ' story .
RELEASE

The film was the first Hollywood big - budget , big - star film to tackle the issue of AIDS in the U.S. ( following the TV movie And the Band Played On ) and signaled a shift in Hollywood films toward more realistic depictions of people in the LGBT community .

The DVD edition , produced by Automat Pictures , includes this scene .
The screenplay was also republished in a novelization by writer Christopher Davis in 1994 .

CRITICAL RESPONSE
Section::::Critical response .
Philadelphia earned mostly positive reviews from critics , with Hanks and Washington receiving wide praise for their performances , and garnering a 78 % approval rating at online movie critic site Rotten Tomatoes , based on 47 reviews , with an average rating of 6.6/10 .
In a contemporary review for the Chicago Sun - Times , Roger Ebert gave the film three - and - a - half out of four stars and said that it is " quite a good film , on its own terms .
And for moviegoers with an antipathy to AIDS but an enthusiasm for stars like Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington , it may help to broaden understanding of the disease .
It 's a ground - breaker like Guess
Who 's Coming to Dinner ( 1967 ) , the first major film about an interracial romance
; it uses the chemistry of popular stars in a reliable genre to sidestep what looks like controversy . "
Christopher Matthews from the Seattle Post - Intelligencer wrote " Jonathan Demme 's long - awaited Philadelphia is so expertly acted , well - meaning and gutsy that you find yourself constantly pulling for it to be the definitive AIDS movie . "
James Berardinelli from ReelViews wrote " The story is timely and powerful , and the performances of Hanks and Washington assure that the characters will not immediately vanish into obscurity . "
Rita Kempley from The Washington Post wrote " It 's less like a film by Demme than the best of Frank Capra .
It is not just canny , corny and blatantly patriotic , but compassionate , compelling and emotionally devastating . "

Philadelphia was released on VHS and DVD on September 10 1997 .
Philadelphia was later released on Blu - Ray on May 14 2013 .
