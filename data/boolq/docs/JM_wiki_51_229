SUMMARY Section::::Summary .
The match began with Liverpool 's kickoff and the team 's successive attacks to counter Madrid 's slower , possession - based buildup .
In the 23rd minute , a low shot by Trent Alexander - Arnold went through a defender 's legs and forced a late save by Keylor Navas .
Two minutes later , Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah was injured competing for the ball with Sergio Ramos , who had locked Salah 's arm resulting in a fall .
Due to a dislocated shoulder , Salah was substituted four minutes later for Adam Lallana .
Madrid 's Dani Carvajal was substituted in the 37th minute with a hamstring injury after an unsuccessful backheel .
Minutes later , Karim Benzema 's goal was disallowed after he was determined to be offside while finishing a shot started by Cristiano Ronaldo 's header .
The first half ended scoreless , with Madrid dominating possession but Liverpool having more chances to score .
The second half began with a shot by Isco , who hit the crossbar .
In the 51st minute , Benzema scored the match 's first goal by deflecting a throw by Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius back into the net .

Gareth Bale was substituted in for Isco in the 61st minute and scored Madrid 's second goal two minutes later , using an acrobatic bicycle kick to finish a cross by Marcelo from the left .
Liverpool pressed for a second equalising goal , with a shot by Mané that hit the goal post and calls for a penalty for an alleged handball , but were also losing possession to Madrid .
Ronaldo had a chance to score his first goal of the match during a counterattack in the 73rd minute , but was tackled by Liverpool defender Andrew Robertson in the penalty box .
Bale scored his second goal of the match in the 83rd minute on a shot that swerved in front of Karius and went through his hands and into the net .

STATISTICS POST - MATCH Section::::Post - match .
Real Madrid became the first team since Bayern Munich in 1974–76 to win three consecutive UEFA Champions Leagues or European Cups .
The title was Madrid 's 13th , another Champions League record , and their fourth in five years .
Real Madrid 's victory was the fifth consecutive title for a Spanish side in the Champions League , becoming the longest run for the trophy to be held by teams from the same country since English sides won six consecutive titles between 1977 and 1982 .
Manager Zinedine Zidane became the first to win three consecutive Champions League titles and matched Carlo Ancelotti 's record of Champions League era wins .
Five days after the final , Zidane announced that he would step down as manager in favour of a " different voice " .
Cristiano Ronaldo became the first player to win the Champions League five times , surpassing the record set by Clarence Seedorf in 2007 and by Andrés Iniesta in 2015 .
Gareth Bale became the first substitute to score two goals in a Champions League final and was named man of the match .
His first goal received acclaim as one of the best in Champions League history and was compared to Ronaldo 's bicycle kick goal against Juventus in the quarter - final and manager Zinedine Zidane 's goal in the 2002 final .
Sergio Ramos 's tackle on Mohamed Salah received mixed reactions from the press and fans on whether the injury was the result of a deliberate blow or an accident .
Egyptian fans responded with anger on social media , including insults that became trending topics on Twitter .
A Change.org petition calling on UEFA and FIFA to punish Ramos for the challenge received 400,000 signatures within two days .
A separate incident involving Ramos and Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius raised questions after a video showed him allegedly elbowing Karius in the face prior to his first goalkeeping error .
UEFA declined to take action against Ramos for the incident with Karius .
After an examination , on 4 June 2018 , physiatrist Ross Zafonte at the Massachusetts General Hospital said in a statement that Karius suffered a concussion during the match and that , according to him , it was possible the concussion would affect the player 's performance .
Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp lost his sixth of seven major finals , including Champions League and league cups .
After the match , Loris Karius tearfully apologised to Liverpool supporters who remained in the stands and stated that his mistakes " lost the team the final " .
After the match , Karius received online death threats and hate messages directed at him and his family .
