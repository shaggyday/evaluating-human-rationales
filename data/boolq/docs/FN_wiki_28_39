ENGLAND
AT
THE FIFA WORLD CUP
The England national football team has competed at the FIFA World Cup since 1950 .
The FIFA World Cup is the premier competitive international football tournament , first played in 1930 , whose finals stage has been held every four years since , except 1942 and 1946 , due to the Second World War .
The tournament consists of two parts , the qualification phase and the final phase ( officially called the World Cup Finals ) .
The qualification phase , which currently take place over the three years preceding the finals , is used to determine which teams qualify for the finals .
The current format of the finals involves thirty - two teams competing for the title , at venues within the host nation ( or nations ) over a period of about a month .
The World Cup Finals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world , with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the 2006 Final .
England did not enter the competition until 1950 , but have entered all eighteen subsequent tournaments .
They have failed to qualify for the finals on three occasions , 1974 ( West Germany ) , 1978 ( Argentina ) and 1994 ( United States ) , and have failed to advance from the group stages on three occasions ; at the 1950 FIFA World Cup , the 1958 FIFA World Cup and the 2014 FIFA World Cup .
Their best ever performance is winning the Cup in the 1966 tournament held in England , whilst they also finished in fourth place in 1990 , in Italy , and in 2018 in Russia .
Other than that , the team have reached the quarter - finals on nine occasions , the latest of which were at the 2002 ( South Korea / Japan ) and the 2006 ( Germany ) .
England are the only team not representing a sovereign state to win the World Cup , which they did in 1966 when they hosted the finals .
They defeated West Germany 4–2 after extra time to win the World Cup title .
Since then , they have generally reached the knockout stages of almost every competition they have qualified for , including a fourth - place finish in the 1990 and 2018 World Cups .
HISTORY
BRAZIL 1950 Section::::History .
Section::::Brazil 1950 .
England 's first qualifying campaign for the FIFA World Cup doubled as the 1950 British Home Championship .
The series kicked off for England on 15 October 1949 at Ninian Park , Cardiff , against Wales .
Stan Mortensen gave England the lead after twenty two minutes , and just seven minutes later , Jackie Milburn doubled the lead .
This was the first goal of Milburn 's hat trick , which left England 4–0 up with 20 minutes to play .
Mal Griffiths scored a consolation goal for Wales ten minutes from time , but England held on for a comfortable victory .
A month later , England welcomed Ireland to Maine Road , and it began well for the home side as Jack Rowley scored inside six minutes .
England were already 6–0 up , thanks to Jack Froggatt , two for Stan Pearson , Stan Mortensen and a second from Rowley , by the time Ireland struck back through Samuel Smyth after 55 minutes .
Rowley added a third and a fourth to his tally in the three minutes following Smyth 's goal , however , leaving the score at 8–1 at the hour mark .
The frantic scoring rate calmed down after that , with only one apeice before the final whistle , with Stan Pearson completing his brace for England 's ninth , and Bobby Brennan scoring for Ireland .
It was not until May 1950 that England travelled to Hampden Park to face Scotland , who were also undefeated after their games against Ireland and Wales .
With the top two from the group qualifying , both teams were guaranteed progression to the finals , and the game was solely for the honour of winning the British Home Championship , and the seeding advantage to be enjoyed upon reaching Brazil .
A solitary goal from Roy Bentley gave England the victory , the title and the top spot in the group .
1950
FINALS
Section::::1950 Finals .
England were seeded in pot one for the finals , which meant they were the favourites to progress from Group 2 , which also contained Spain , Chile and the United States .
England 's campaign kicked off against Chile in Rio de Janeiro , and , as was expected , England cruised to a 2–0 victory , courtesy of goals from Stan Mortensen and Wilf Mannion .
Their troubles began four days later when they faced the Americans in Belo Horizonte in what has become one of the most famous matches of all time .
Joe Gaetjens scored the only goal of the match to give the United States an unlikely victory , which has gone down as one of the World Cup 's greatest upsets .
A myth arose that the English newspapers were so confident of an English victory that when the result was telegrammed back , they assumed a misprint and printed the score as 10–1 in England 's favour .
However , this has proven to be untrue .
This left England in a sticky situation prior to their final match , against Spain in Rio .
They needed to win , and for Chile to beat the United States to stand any chance of going through , and even then they would need the goal averages to fall in their favour .
As it turned out , no such calculations were necessary , despite Chile 's victory , as Spain 's Zarra scored the only goal of the game , eliminating England from the competition .
SWITZERLAND 1954 Section::::Switzerland 1954 .
As with their first World Cup , England 's qualifying for the 1954 edition also constituted the 1953–54 British Home Championship .
They played Wales at Ninian Park as their first match once again , and the 4–1 result was the same .
However , unlike four years earlier , it was the home side that went into the lead , after twenty two minutes through Ivor Allchurch .
Despite being 1–0 down at half time , England scored four within eight minutes of the restart ; two each for Dennis Wilshaw and Nat Lofthouse .
Goodison Park was the venue for England 's home clash against Ireland , who were newly renamed Northern Ireland .
Harold Hassall got England off to a good start with a goal after just ten minutes .
Eddie McMorran put the Irish back on terms just before the hour mark , but Hassall completed his brace six minutes later .
Lofthouse completed a comfortable 3–1 win for England .
With the top two in the group qualifying for the finals , the final game between England and Scotland , at Hampden Park , settled nothing except the placings within the group , despite Scotland having dropped a point with a 3–3 draw at home to Wales .
Allan Brown put the home side ahead after just seven minutes , but it was all square again thanks to Ivor Broadis just four minutes later .
Johnny Nicholls gave England the lead for the first time just after half time , and they began to extend a lead after Ronnie Allen 's 68th - minute goal .
Jimmy Mullen made the game all but certain seven minutes from time , and although Willie Ormond scored a consolation for Scotland with just 1 minute to play , England topped the competition for the second time in a row .
1954 FINALS Section::::1954 Finals .
England were drawn in Group 4 for the finals , with hosts Switzerland , Italy and Belgium .
In an odd twist , unique to the 1954 tournament , England and Italy , as the two seeded teams in the group , did not have to play each other .
Equally , Switzerland and Belgium did not have to play each other .
England 's first game in Switzerland was against Belgium in Basel , and they suffered a shock as Léopold Anoul put the Belgians into the lead after just five minutes .
Ivor Broadis put the favourites back on terms just over twenty minutes later , and although Nat Lofthouse gave England the lead 10 minutes later , it was proving to be tougher than they had expected against the Belgians .
Broadis scored his second just after the hour , but Henri Coppens hit back four minutes later to keep Belgium in the game at only 3–2 down .
Anoul completed his brace another four minutes after that to level the scores again .
In another oddity peculiar to this World Cup , drawn matches in the group stage would go to extra time , and as such the teams played on with the score at 3–3 .
Just one minute into the added period , Lofthouse added a fourth for England and they seemed to have won it , but Jimmy Dickinson scored an own goal three minutes later to put the score back at 4–4 .
It stayed this way until the extra period was up , and as penalty shoot - outs were yet to be invented and replays were not used in the group , the match was recorded as a draw .
England 's second and final group game was against the hosts in Bern .
This proved to be an easier game for the Three Lions , and they scored one goal in each half ( from Jimmy Mullen and Dennis Wilshaw respectively ) to give them a comfortable win of 2–0 .
As Switzerland ( against England ) , Italy ( against Switzerland ) and Belgium ( against Italy ) had all lost one game , England progressed as group winners , along with Switzerland , who won a play - off against Italy .
England faced the winners of group three and defending champions Uruguay in the quarter - finals .
Carlos Borges gave the South Americans the lead inside 5 minutes , but Lofthouse put England back on terms ten minutes later .
England were clearly struggling , but held on until just before half time , when Obdulio Varela gave the lead back Uruguay .
Juan Alberto Schiaffino doubled the lead just after the break , but Tom Finney kept England 's foot in the door with his sixty seventh - minute goal .
However , it was all over after Javier Ambrois restored the two - goal lead with twelve minutes to play .
The score remained at 4–2 , and England were eliminated from the cup .
SWEDEN 1958 Section::::Sweden 1958 .
For the first time , England had to play against countries other than the Home Nations to reach the Finals in Sweden .
They were drawn against the Republic of Ireland and Denmark .
In the qualifying round , England won three out of the four games and drew the other .
Four months before the World Cup , Roger Byrne , Duncan Edwards , David Pegg and Tommy Taylor all lost their lives in the Munich air disaster while playing for Manchester United .
At the finals , which is the only tournament to have seen all Home Nations take part , the Home Nations were all drawn in different groups .
England were drawn against the Soviet Union ( 2–2 ) , Brazil ( 0–0 ) and Austria ( 2–2 ) , who finished third in the 1954 World Cup .
At the end of the group stage , Soviet Union and England each had three points , and had scored four goals and conceded four goals .
This meant there was a play - off to decide the second - placed team in the group , the winner to qualify .
England lost the play - off 1–0 and were thus knocked out .
The only consolation for England was that they were the only team to play the eventual winners Brazil and not lose .
CHILE 1962 Section::::Chile 1962 .
The third World Cup which took place in South America , saw England qualify from the group , which contained Portugal and Luxembourg , defeating Luxembourg on both occasions , and defeating Portugal at home , and drawing in Lisbon .
At the finals , England were drawn in a group with Hungary , Argentina and Bulgaria .
England defeated Argentina 3 - 1 , thanks to goals from Ron Flowers , Bobby Charlton and Jimmy Greaves , before playing out a goalless draw with Bulgaria , and a 2–1 defeat to Hungary .
England finished in second place behind Hungary and played the winners of group 3 , defending champions Brazil , in the quarter - finals .
Brazil scored first through Garrincha , before an equaliser for Gerry Hitchens before half time .
However , second - half goals from Garrincha and Vavá meant Brazil won the game 3–1 , and eliminated England from the competition .
This defeat was manager Walter Winterbottom 's last game in charge .
Winterbottom had led England to four World Cup Finals .
From May 1963 , Alf Ramsey became the manager of England .
ENGLAND 1966 Section::::England 1966 .
In the 1966 World Cup Finals , England used their home advantage and , under Ramsey , won their first , and only , World Cup title .
England played all their games at Wembley Stadium in London , which became the last time that the hosts were granted this privilege .
After drawing 0–0 in the opening game against former champions Uruguay , which started a run of four games all ending goalless .
England then beat both France and Mexico 2–0 and qualified for the quarter - finals .
The quarter - finals saw England play Argentina , which ended in a 1–0 win to England .
This match saw the start of the rivalry between England and Argentina , when Argentinian Antonio Rattín was dismissed by German referee Rudolf Kreitlein in a very fierce game .
A 2–1 win against Portugal in the semi - final then followed .
Portugal were the first team to score against England in the tournament .
The final saw England play West Germany , with the result finishing in a 4–2 win for England , after extra time .
MEXICO 1970 Section::::Mexico 1970 .
1970 saw the first World Cup finals take place in North America and England qualified automatically for the tournament by winning the 1966 FIFA World Cup .
England were drawn in a group with Romania , former world champions Brazil and Czechoslovakia .
Each of the matches only saw one goal , with England defeating Romania and Czechoslovakia , and losing to Brazil .
The quarter - final saw a repeat of the 1966 final , with England playing West Germany .
England were hampered by the fact that first - choice goalkeeper Gordon Banks was ill , and Peter Bonetti played instead .
England led 2–0 with goals by Alan Mullery and Martin Peters , but in the 70th minute , Franz Beckenbauer pulled one goal back for West Germany .
After Beckenbauer 's goal , Ramsey substituted Bobby Charlton , who overtook Billy Wright as England 's most capped player ever , with caps totalling 106 .
Uwe Seeler equalised for the Germans in the eighty first minute , thereby taking the game into extra time .
During extra time , Gerd Müller scored the winning goal for West Germany which saw the German side win 3–2 .
This turned out to be Charlton 's last game for England .
WEST GERMANY 1974 Section::::West Germany 1974 .
For the first time , England did not qualify for a World Cup .
In a group with Olympic champions Poland and Wales , England could not overtake Poland .
After only drawing at home to Wales 1–1 and losing the first leg 2–0 to Poland , meant that England had to beat Poland at home , whilst Poland only needed to draw .
Poland managed to withstand England 's attacks in the first half , who had Martin Peters playing for them .
Poland took the lead in the 57th minute with a goal from Jan Domarski .
England equalised six minutes later , with a penalty converted by Allan Clarke .
England were unable to score any more goals with goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski keeping England at bay .
Brian Clough had previously called Tomaszewski a " clown " .
The commentator of the game then said " it 's all over " .
Poland took this good form to the finals and ended in third place .
After failing to qualify , Alf Ramsey resigned from his post and after a time , where Ramsey and his predecessor had lasted a total of 29 years , no manager was able to last in the job for longer than eight years .
This ended when Bobby Robson became England manager .
ARGENTINA 1978 Section::::Argentina 1978 .
England also did not qualify for the fourth World Cup which took place in South America .
This time , England were denied by Italy , who had scored three more goals than England after both teams finished on the same points .
Goals scored dictated who qualified after the head - to - head record between the two sides finished the same , following a 2–0 home win for each team .
The lower - ranked teams in the group were Finland and Luxembourg , but the size of the wins against them proved to be decisive .
Nevertheless , Ron Greenwood was given a second chance in charge of England , after taking the role in 1977 .
SPAIN 1982 Section::::Spain 1982 .
1982 saw the first time where the European Qualifying Rounds were divided into groups of five teams , where the top two teams qualify for the World Cup .
Greenwood used his second chance and took England to Spain by finishing second behind Hungary and above Romania , Switzerland and Norway .
At the finals , England won all three group games , defeating France 3 - 1 , with a brace from Bryan Robson , before beating Czechoslovakia 2–0 , with a Jozef Barmos own goal , and World Cup newcomers Kuwait 1–0 , thanks to a Trevor Francis goal .
The next round saw a second group stage consisting of three teams , a first time event at the World Cup .
England drew with West Germany 0–0 and after the Germans beat Spain 2–1 , England then had to beat Spain with a two - goal difference to progress to the next round .
England , however , only managed a 0–0 draw against the Spanish .
England remained unbeaten at the end of the tournament .
After the World Cup , Ron Greenwood 's time as England manager ended , and he was replaced by Bobby Robson .
MEXICO 1986 Section::::Mexico 1986 .
1986 saw the second World Cup to take place in Mexico .
England qualified for Mexico 1986 by winning four games and drawing four times against Northern Ireland , who qualified in second place , Romania , Finland and Turkey .
In Mexico , England lost their opening game to Portugal 1–0 and could only manage a goalless draw against Morocco .
The final group game , however , saw England beat Poland 3–0 , which is one of the three highest scores for England at the World Cup , with Gary Lineker scoring a hat - trick .
This result took England to second place and finished behind Morocco .
England then also beat Paraguay 3–0 in the Round of 16 .
In the quarter - finals , England renewed their rivalry with Argentina in a game that has become notorious for the Argentina goals , both scored by Diego Maradona .
Maradona 's first goal , known as the Hand of God , was illegal and should not have counted , as he used his hand to punch the ball into the net .
However , the referee missed this infringement , and ruled that the goal should stand .
Maradona then made the score 2 - 0 , famously dribbling from inside Argentina 's half and around several English players before scoring .
Gary Lineker pulled back the score to 2 - 1 , but England ran out of time to equalise , and were eliminated .
Nevertheless , Lineker finished with the Golden Boot by scoring six goals and thereby becoming England 's first Golden Boot winner .
ITALY 1990 Section::::Italy 1990 .
By winning three and drawing three , England qualified for Italia ' 90 , the second World Cup to be held in Italy , scoring ten goals and conceding none .
England were unbeaten through qualification , winning three games , and drawing the remaining three , but still finished second to Sweden , whom they drew with twice .
England profited from Romania 's 3–1 win over Denmark , who , had they won , would have qualified as the third - best second - placed team .
West Germany and England were able to qualify for Italia ' 90 as the best second - placed teams in the groups with four teams .
Because a few years previously saw English hooligans at European competition matches , England were forced to play their group games on Sardinia and Sicily .
In group F , was the European champions Netherlands , the Republic of Ireland and Egypt and England .
After opening the tournament with a 1–1 draw against Ireland and a 0–0 draw against the Dutch , England then beat Egypt 1–0 .
This was Egypt 's first appearance since the 1934 World Cup .
England won the group with four points .
In the next round , England had to play Belgium .
The game went to extra time , and in the hundredth and nineteenth minute , David Platt scored the winning goal .
England also had to play extra time against Cameroon in the quarter - finals .
Cameroon were the first African team to have reached the quarter - finals .
England opened the scoring through David Platt , but Cameroon quickly turned around the game to lead 2 - 1 .
Lineker subsequently won and scored a penalty in the 83rd minute to ensure the game went to extra time .
He then scored a second penalty , to see England reach the semi - finals .
In the semi - finals , England met West Germany .
There was no separating the two teams after 90 minutes , which made England the first team to have played extra time in three successive World Cup games .
There was also no separating the two teams after extra time , thereby taking the game to penalties .
Although English goalkeeper Peter Shilton dived the right way for every penalty , he was unable to save any .
German goalkeeper Bodo Illgner , having failed to save any of England 's first three penalties , saved England 's fourth penalty , taken by Stuart Pearce .
Olaf Thon then scored for Germany , meaning that England 's Chris Waddle would have to score his fifth penalty and hope that Shilton saved the Germans ' fifth penalty .
However , Waddle 's penalty missed completely , going high over the crossbar , thereby resulting in
England 's being knocked out of the competition .
The third - place playoff between England and Italy saw England lose their only game of the tournament in normal time .
Even though this was England 's best finish since the 1966 World Cup , Bobby Robson 's time as England manager had come to an end .
UNITED STATES 1994 Section::::United States 1994 .
For the 1994 World Cup in the United States , under the leadership of new manager Graham Taylor , England surprisingly did not qualify for the tournament .
In a group with six teams , England lost to Norway and the Netherlands , finishing third above Poland , Turkey and San Marino .
England went into their final game with San Marino knowing they would need a seven - goal victory and for Poland to beat the Netherlands in the other match in order to qualify .
In the game against San Marino , Davide Gualtieri scored against England after nine seconds , taking the lead for the outsiders .
England went on to win 7–1 , which was too small a goal margin .
Additionally , despite the half - time score between the Poles and the Dutch being 1 - 1 , the Dutch went on to win 3 - 1 , meaning that however many goals England scored , they could still not qualify .
Taylor 's tenure in charge ended and he was replaced by Terry Venables , who was dismissed after England lost the semi - final of Euro 1996 , hosted in England .
FRANCE 1998 Section::::France 1998 .
After missing out on the World Cup in 1994 , England , managed by Glenn Hoddle , qualified for the World Cup in France .
England were drawn in Group 2 of UEFA qualifying with Italy , Poland , Georgia and Moldova .
England beat Poland , Georgia and Moldova both home and away , but a home defeat to Italy in their fourth match meant they went into the final qualifier at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome just a point ahead of the Azzurri and only needing a draw to qualify automatically ; defeat would see them have to navigate a play - off to secure qualification .
The match finished as a goalless draw and England finished top of the group .
At the finals in France , England played in Group G. England
defeated Tunisia 2–0 in the first game , with goals from Alan Shearer and Paul Scholes .
Their second match saw England lose 2–1 to Romania ; despite an 81st - minute equaliser from Michael Owen , Dan Petrescu scored a winner shortly before injury time .
In their final group game , England defeated Colombia 2–0 in the decisive match , thanks to goals from midfielders Darren Anderton and David Beckham .
England finished second in Group G , which saw them qualify for the last 16 phase , and play the winner of 1998 FIFA World Cup Group H , Argentina .
In a fiery game containing six yellow cards and two penalties , David Beckham was controversially sent off in the 47th minute for what many felt was at most a yellow card offence , knocking over Diego Simeone .
Gabriel Batistuta opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the fifth minute of the game , before an equaliser also from the spot by Alan Shearer four minutes later .
England took the lead through Owen , in the 16th minute .
Argentina drew level through Javier Zanetti in injury time of the first half .
The game finished 2 - 2 , and , as neither team were able to find a winner in extra time , penalties were needed to decide the team that qualified to the next round .
While David Seaman did save one penalty , Argentine goalkeeper Carlos Roa managed to save two , including the vital one from David Batty , thereby knocking England out of the World Cup .
Beckham subsequently received death threats and was sent bullets in the post .
SOUTH
KOREA / JAPAN 2002 Section::::South Korea / Japan 2002 .
In 2002 the World Cup took place in Asia for the first time .
England , under its first ever foreign manager in Swedish Sven - Göran Eriksson , were able to qualify for the tournament .
England were drawn in Group 9 , alongside Germany , Finland , Greece and Albania .
In the last ever game in the original Wembley Stadium , ( which closed after the match ) England played Germany , losing 1–0 , the only goal scored by Dietmar Hamann .
The match was the last under the management of Kevin Keegan , who resigned at the end of the match , and was replaced by Eriksson .
By beating Germany 5–1 in Munich , England 's qualifying campaign was revitalised , and they qualified automatically , by drawing 2–2 with Greece .
Germany , who could only draw 0–0 with Finland , had to play a play - off game against Ukraine , with England qualifying ahead winning the group .
In Japan , England had to play against Eriksson 's homeland , Sweden , and both settled out for a 1–1 draw .
England and Beckham gained a measure of revenge for their previous 1998 defeat in defeating Argentina 1 - 0 , thanks to a Beckham penalty .
However , England could only manage a disappointing 0 - 0 draw against Nigeria , meaning that although they were able to qualify for the second round , where they played Denmark , they qualified as runners up , which meant that they would meet favourites Brazil in the quarter - finals if they qualified .
England played Denmark in the round of 16 defeating Denmark 3–0 , thanks to goals from Micheal Owen , Rio Ferdinand , and Emile Heskey .
England played four - time World Cup winners and 1998 runners - up Brazil in the quarter - finals .
Despite leading through a Michael Owen goal , a mistake by David Seaman saw England lose 2–1 , and Brazil won their fourth World Cup match against England , and went on to win the tournament .
GERMANY 2006
Section::::Germany 2006 .
England were drawn into Group 6 of European qualifying for the 2006 World Cup .
The group featured other home nations in Wales , and Northern Ireland , as well as Poland ( who had eliminated England the last time the World Cup took place in Germany ) , Azerbaijan and Austria .
England won eight of the 10 games , and qualified as group winners , in front of Portugal , despite drawing to Austria in Vienna , and losing to Northern Ireland in Belfast .
In Germany , however , England were less convincing .
England played in Group B , alongside Paraguay , Trinidad and Tobago , and Sweden .
England started with a 1–0 win against Paraguay ; which was won due to a 3rd minute own goal .
The second game against first time qualifiers Trinidad and Tobago saw England have to wait until the 83rd minute for England to take the lead , with Peter Crouch opened the scoring with a goal many felt was illegal , and the second goal of the game coming in added time from Steven Gerrard .
The last group game saw England play against Sweden , where an eventual 2 - 2 draw saw them qualify for the next round as group winners , thereby avoiding playing hosts Germany .
In the last 16 stage , a free kick from David Beckham saw England win 1–0 against Ecuador and reach the quarter - finals , where they faced Portugal .
The game finished goalless , and England once again were knocked out on penalties and Portuguese goalkeeper Ricardo
became the first goalkeeper to save three penalties in a penalty shoot - out .
Ricardo saved from Frank Lampard , Steven Gerrard , and Jamie Carragher ; the only England player who converted his penalty was Owen Hargreaves .
Portugal won the shoot - out 3 - 1 , despite misses from Petit and Hugo Viana .
This game was also Erickson 's final match as England manager .
SOUTH AFRICA 2010 Section::::South Africa 2010 .
Qualification for the first African World Cup went successfully for new England manager Fabio Capello , after previous manager Steve McClaren was unable to secure qualification to the Euro 2008 .
By winning nine times and only losing to Ukraine , England qualified ahead of Croatia , Belarus , Kazakhstan and Andorra .
England 's group was seen as a favourable one , containing comparatively much weaker teams .
However , England opened up their campaign with a 1–1 draw against the United States , thanks to a major error by goalkeeper Robert Green .
They then drew 0–0 against Algeria and were booed off the field by their own fans , drawing the ire of striker Wayne Rooney .
England eventually qualified for the next round by beating Slovenia 1–0 , but only qualified as runners up to the United States , thereby meaning they would draw favourites Germany .
In the second round match , Germany took the lead after 20 minutes after goalkeeper Manuel Neuer played the ball down the pitch to Miroslav Klose , who opened the scoring .
The score became 2–0 to Germany after 32 minutes .
Shortly after , England defender Matthew Upson scored a header .
Later , Frank Lampard had a shot at goal which was disallowed despite crossing the line ; which was confirmed on replays .
German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer admitted subsequently he knew the ball had crossed the line , but decided to deceive the referee .
The German media reported it was " revenge for Wembley " , while the English media criticised FIFA 's refusal to implement goal - line technology .
Ironically , despite his earlier opposition to goal - line technology , Sepp Blatter said that it should be introduced after a Ukrainian goal against England at Euro 2012 was ruled out .
As England tried to equalise , Germany used this to their advantage and scored two more goals .
This became Germany 's biggest win against England in a World Cup , winning 4 - 1 .
BRAZIL 2014
Section::::Brazil 2014 .
Under Roy Hodgson , who replaced Fabio Capello after Euro 2012 after a disagreement between Capello and The FA , England qualified for
the second World Cup to be held in Brazil .
Ukraine were again one of the opponents in the qualifying rounds .
The other opponents included Montenegro , Poland , Moldova and San Marino .
After winning six games and drawing four , England qualified unbeaten .
The draw for the finals saw England have to play against Italy and Uruguay , both former world champions , which meant that it was the first ever time three World Champions were drawn in the same group , along with Costa Rica .
England lost to Italy and Uruguay , and were thus knocked out after two games .
The final match against Costa Rica finished as a goalless draw .
This performance was statistically their worst ever performance at a World Cup , ending up with just one point after two losses to Uruguay and Italy and a goalless draw with Costa Rica in the dead rubber match , their lowest points total in the group stage of a world cup .
RUSSIA 2018 Section::::Russia 2018 .
England played in UEFA Group F in qualification for the 2018 World Cup , in a group of six with Slovakia , Slovenia , Scotland , Lithuania and Malta , with only the winner of the group guaranteed qualification .
England went into the qualification process under manager Sam Allardyce , only for Allardyce to leave the post after just one game due to controversy regarding discussing breaking FIFA rules .
Under Allardyce 's replacement , Gareth Southgate , England went undefeated throughout qualification , winning eight matches out of 10 , drawing with Slovenia 0–0 in Ljubljana , and drawing 2–2 with Scotland in Glasgow thanks to a 90th - minute equaliser from Harry Kane .
This was the third successive major tournament that England were undefeated , having been undefeated in 2014 World Cup , and Euro 2016 qualifying .
2018 FINALS Section::::2018 Finals .
Under Gareth Southgate , the England team began their tournament in group G against Tunisia .
The game started well for England with a goal from Harry Kane in the 11th minute .
Tunisia equalised through Sassi from the penalty spot in the 35th minute following a foul by Kyle Walker .
Some controversy followed as various potential offences against Harry Kane , inside the penalty area were ignored by the referee and no VAR checks were carried out .
England persevered and scored a second goal in the 91st minute , again by Harry Kane , resulting in a 2–1 victory .
In the second group stage match , England surpassed their record for goals scored in a World Cup match by beating Panama 6 - 1 .
Jesse Lingard scored the third goal , John Stones scored the first and fourth goals and Harry Kane scored a hat - trick with the second , fifth and sixth goals .
In the final group stage match , England narrowly lost 1 - 0 to Belgium .
Adnan Januzaj scored the sole goal of the game ; but with both teams having fielded reserve teams , with England specifically making 9 changes .
Before the game media outlets stating that a loss could potentially become beneficial , as the winner would be in the half of the draw with four of the top seven sides in the world .
The result that meant Belgium topped the group and England finished second , setting up a last 16 clash with Group H winners Colombia .
England played their last 16 match in the Otkritie Arena , Moscow , with the same team as against Tunisia .
Harry Kane scored his sixth goal of the tournament , and the third penalty , after once again being fouled in the box from a corner , similarly as against Panama .
The score remained at 1 - 0 , until stoppage time , where a header from Yerry Mina beat Jordan Pickford in goal to bring the game to extra time .
Neither team managed to score in extra time , and the match went to penalties , which England won 4 - 3 .
As well as being the first knockout match England had won at a major tournament since 2006 ( last defeating Ecuador in the last 16 ) ; it was the first time England won a World Cup penalty shoot - out .
The match was notable for the heated atmosphere the game was played in , with a total of eight yellow cards being shown in the match .
England played against Sweden in their quarter - final at Cosmos Arena , Samara on 7 July 2018 .
They won the match 2–0 , with defender Harry Maguire scoring his first England goal , a header scored from a corner , and Dele Alli a second header from close range .
This would send them through to their third World Cup semi - final and their first since 1990 , and third overall .
The team played Croatia in the semi - final , resulting in a 2–1 loss after extra time .
England would later finish fourth in the competition , the best result since 1990 .
England would lose again to Belgium in the 3rd place playoff , thanks to goals from Thomas Meunier and Eden Hazard , despite an Eric Dier shot being cleared off the line by Toby Alderweireld .
The tournament would see England score nine goals from set - pieces – the most by a team in a single World Cup tournament since 1966 .
