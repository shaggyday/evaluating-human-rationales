BICYCLE HELMET LAWS BY COUNTRY
The wearing of bicycle helmets , and attitudes towards their use vary around the world .
Compulsory use of helmets has often been proposed and is the subject of much dispute ( see Bicycle helmet laws ) , based largely on considerations of overall public health .
Only two countries ( Australia and New Zealand ) currently require and enforce universal use of helmets by cyclists .
In some other jurisdictions , partial rules apply - for children , in certain states or sub - national areas , or under other limited conditions .
USE Section::::Use .
Denmark and the Netherlands have a strong cycling culture and have amongst the lowest levels of helmet use .
LEGISLATION BY COUNTRY Section::::Legislation by country .
Australia was the first country to enact mandatory bicycle helmet use for all cyclists .
Mexico City has had mandatory cycle helmet laws repealed , and in Italy the Federazione Italiana Amici della Bicicletta managed to block a proposed helmet law .
While bicycle helmets are not required to be worn by law in the United Kingdom the British Medical Association advocates the compulsory use of helmets .
Cycling UK , the largest cycling advocacy organisation in the UK , consider helmet wearing as personal choice rather than being mandated by legislation .
In 2002 an attempt was made to introduce bicycle helmet legislation in Poland but it was opposed by cyclists ' organisations .
