HIGH - ALTITUDE FLATUS EXPULSION High - altitude flatus expulsion ( HAFE ) is a gastrointestinal syndrome which involves the spontaneous passage of increased quantities of rectal gases at high altitudes .
First described by Joseph Hamel in c. 1820 and occasionally described afterward , a landmark study of this phenomenon was published in 1981 by Paul Auerbach and York Miller .
The phenomenon is based on the differential in atmospheric pressure , directly correlated with the observer 's frequency of and level of experience in high - altitude metabolism .
As the external pressure decreases , the difference in pressure between the gas within the body and the atmosphere outside is higher , and the urge to expel gas to relieve the pressure is greater .
Consistent with Boyle 's law , controlling for dietary variance , the amount of gas produced is constant in mass , but the volume increases as the external pressure decreases .
The feeling of fullness or need to expel brought on by this differential in atmospheric pressure has been verified by studies involving military pilots subjected to pressure changes simulating flight .
