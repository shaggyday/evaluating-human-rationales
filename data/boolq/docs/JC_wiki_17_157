GAMEPLAY AND SYNOPSIS Section::::Gameplay and synopsis .
The game takes place in a first - person perspective , and starts out in an indistinct black space , with a grey morphing blob ; walking up to it displays a text about a person named Jacob Ernholtz who has committed suicide by hanging at the age of 31 .
The perspective then shifts to Ernholtz as he is waking up in his apartment ; the player – as Ernholtz – must then perform a few menial tasks in the apartment , which is dimly lit with all the doors and windows boarded up .
Exploring the apartment reveals that Ernholtz has developed an obsession with a painting of two palm trees and its painter Jason Malone , who a news article pinned to the refrigerator claims has disappeared .
The player can also find a hidden doorway behind a bookcase finding Malone in a cage – the player is given the option to either unlock the cage or electrocute Malone .
The player then must go to a final room and commit suicide by hanging ; the perspective then shifts back to the black space with multiple grey blobs , each with another person 's name and method of suicide .
