LIST OF PHARAOHS
This article contains a list of the pharaohs of Ancient Egypt , from the Early Dynastic Period before 3100 BC through to the end of the Ptolemaic Dynasty , when Egypt became a province of Rome under Caesar Augustus in 30 BC .
Note that the dates given are approximate .
The list of pharaohs presented below is based on the conventional chronology of Ancient Egypt , mostly based on the Digital Egypt for Universities database developed by the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology , but alternative dates taken from other authorities may be indicated separately .
ANCIENT EGYPTIAN KING
LISTS Section::::Ancient Egyptian king lists .
Modern lists of pharaohs are based on historical records : Ancient Egyptian king lists and later histories , such as Manetho 's Aegyptiaca , as well as archaeological evidence .
Concerning ancient sources , Egyptologists and Historians alike call for caution about the credibility , exactitude and completeness of these sources , many of which were written long after the reigns they report .
An additional problem is that ancient king lists are often damaged , inconsistent with one another and/or selective .
The following ancient king lists are known ( along with the dynasty under which they were created ) ) : *
Den seal impressions ( 1st dynasty ) ; found on a cylinder seal in Den 's tomb .
It lists all 1st dynasty kings from Narmer to Den by their Horus names .
* Palermo stone ( 5th dynasty ) ; carved on an olivin - basalt slab .
Broken into pieces and thus today incomplete .
*
Giza King List ( 6th dynasty ) ; painted with red , green and black ink on gypsum and cedar wood .
Very selective .
* South Saqqara Stone ( 6th dynasty ) ; carved on a black basalt slab .
Very selective .
* Karnak King List ( 18th dynasty ) ; carved on limestone .
Very selective .
* Abydos King List of Seti I ( 19th dynasty ) ; carved on limestone .
Very detailed , but omitting the First Intermediate Period .
* Abydos King List of Ramses II ( 19th dynasty ) ; carved on limestone .
Very selective .
* Saqqara King List ( 19th dynasty ) , carved on limestone .
Very detailed , but omitting most kings of the 1st dynasty for unknown reasons .
*
Turin King List ( 19th dynasty ) ; written with red and black ink on papyrus .
Most possibly the most complete king list in history , today damaged .
* Manetho 's Aegyptiaca ( Greek Period ) ; possibly written on papyrus .
The original writings are lost today and many anecdotes assigned to certain kings seem fictitious .

width="20 % " Dates Sneferu Greek form : Sóris .
Reigned 48 years , giving him enough time to build the Meidum Pyramid , the Bent Pyramid and the Red Pyramid .
Some scholars believe that he was buried in the Red Pyramid .
For a long time it was thought that the Meidum Pyramid was not Sneferu 's work , but that of king Huni .
Ancient Egyptian documents describe Sneferu as a pious , generous and even accostable ruler .
2613–2589 BC Khufu Greek form : Cheops and Suphis .
Built the Great pyramid of Giza .
Khufu is depicted as a cruel tyrant by ancient Greek authors , Ancient Egyptian sources however describe him as a generous and pious ruler .
He is the main protagonist of the famous Westcar Papyrus .
The first imprinted papyri originate from Khufu 's reign , which may have made ancient Greek authors believe that Khufu wrote books in attempt to praise the gods .
2589–2566 BC
Djedefre Greek form : Rátoises .
Some scholars believe he created the Great Sphinx of Giza as a monument for his deceased father .
He also created a pyramid at Abu Rawash .
However , this pyramid is no longer intact as it is believed the Romans recycled the materials it was made from .
2566–2558 BC Khafre Greek form : Chéphren and Suphis II .
His pyramid is the second largest in Giza .
Some scholars prefer him as the creator of the Great Sphinx before Djedefra .
Ancient Greek authors describe Khafra as likewise cruel as Khufu .
2558–2532
BC Baka / Bauefrê Greek form : Bikheris .
Could be the owner of the Unfinished Northern Pyramid of Zawyet el'Aryan .

His pyramid is the third and smallest in Giza .
A legend claims that his only daughter died due an illness and Menkaura buried her in a golden coffin in shape of a cow .

FIRST INTERMEDIATE PERIOD Section::::First Intermediate Period .
The First Intermediate Period ( 2181–2060 BC ) is a period of disarray and chaos between the end of the Old Kingdom and the advent of the Middle Kingdom .
The Old Kingdom rapidly collapsed after the death of Pepi II .
He had reigned for more than 64 and likely up to 94 years , longer than any monarch in history .
The latter years of his reign were marked by inefficiency because of his advanced age .
The union of the Two Kingdoms fell apart and regional leaders had to cope with the resulting famine .
The kings of the 7th and 8th Dynasties , who represented the successors of the 6th Dynasty , tried to hold onto some power in Memphis but owed much of it to powerful nomarchs .
After 20 to 45 years , they were overthrown by a new line of pharaohs based in Herakleopolis Magna .
Some time after these events , a rival line based at Thebes revolted against their nominal Northern overlords and united Upper Egypt .
Around 2055 BC , Mentuhotep II , the son and successor of pharaoh Intef III defeated the Herakleopolitan pharaohs and reunited the Two Lands , thereby starting the Middle Kingdom .
SEVENTH AND EIGHTH DYNASTIES ( COMBINED )
Section::::Seventh and Eighth Dynasties ( combined ) .
The Seventh and Eighth Dynasties ruled for approximately 20–45 years ( possibly 2181 to 2160 BC ) .
They comprise numerous ephemeral kings reigning from Memphis over a possibly divided Egypt and , in any case , holding only limited power owing to the effectively feudal system into which the administration had evolved .
The list below is based on the Abydos King List dating to the reign of Seti I and taken from
Jürgen von Beckerath 's Handbuch der ägyptischen Königsnamen as well as from Kim Ryholt 's latest reconstruction of the Turin canon , another king list dating to the Ramesside Era . !

The Middle Kingdom ( 2060–1802 BC ) is the period from the end of the First Intermediate Period to the beginning of the Second Intermediate Period .
In addition to the Twelfth Dynasty , some scholars include the Eleventh , Thirteenth and Fourteenth Dynasties in the Middle Kingdom .
The Middle Kingdom can be noted for the expansion of trade outside of the kingdom that occurred during this time .
This opening of trade eventually led to the downfall of the Middle Kingdom , induced by an invasion from the Hyksos .

SECOND
INTERMEDIATE PERIOD Section::::Second Intermediate Period .
The Second Intermediate Period ( 1802–1550 BC ) is a period of disarray between the end of the Middle Kingdom , and the start of the New Kingdom .
It is best known as when the Hyksos , whose reign comprised the Fifteenth , made their appearance in Egypt .
The Thirteenth Dynasty was much weaker than the Twelfth Dynasty , and was unable to hold onto the two lands of Egypt .
Either at the start of the dynasty , c. 1805 BC or toward the middle of it in c. 1710 BC , the provincial ruling family in Xois , located in the marshes of the eastern Delta , broke away from the central authority to form the Canaanite Fourteenth Dynasty .
The Hyksos made their first appearance during the reign of Sobekhotep IV , and around 1720 BC took control of the town of Avaris ( the modern Tell el - Dab'a / Khata'na ) , conquering the kingdom of the 14th dynasty .
Then , some time around 1650 BC the Hyksos , perhaps led by Salitis the founder of the Fifteenth Dynasty , conquered Memphis , thereby terminating the 13th dynasty .
The power vacuum in Upper Egypt resulting from the collapse of the 13th dynasty allowed the 16th dynasty to declare its independence in Thebes , only to be overrun by the Hyksos kings shortly thereafter .
Subsequently , as the Hyksos withdrew from Upper Egypt , the native Egyptian ruling house in Thebes set itself up as the Seventeenth Dynasty .
This dynasty eventually drove the Hyksos back into Asia under Seqenenre Tao , Kamose and finally Ahmose , first pharaoh of the New Kingdom .
THIRTEENTH DYNASTY Section::::Thirteenth Dynasty .
The Thirteenth Dynasty ( following the Turin King List ) ruled from 1802 to around 1649 BC and lasted 153 or 154 years according to Manetho .
This table should be contrasted with Known kings of the 13th Dynasty . !

The Fourteenth Dynasty was a local group from the eastern Delta , based at Avaris , that ruled from either from 1805 BC or c. 1710 BC until around 1650 BC .
The dynasty comprised many rulers with West Semitic names and is thus believed to have been Canaanite in origin .
It is here given as per Ryholt , however this reconstruction of the dynasty is heavily debated with the position of the five kings preceding Nehesy highly disputed . !

NEW KINGDOM Section::::New Kingdom .
The New Kingdom ( 1550–1077 BC ) is the period covering the Eighteenth , Nineteenth , and Twentieth dynasty of Egypt , from the 16th to the 11th century BC , between the Second Intermediate Period , and the Third Intermediate Period .
Through military dominance abroad , the New Kingdom saw Egypt 's greatest territorial extent .
It expanded far into Nubia in the south , and held wide territories in the Near East .
Egyptian armies fought with Hittite armies for control of modern - day Syria .
Three of the best known pharaohs of the New Kingdom are Akhenaten , also known as Amenhotep IV , whose exclusive worship of the Aten is often interpreted as the first instance of monotheism , Tutankhamun known for the discovery of his nearly intact tomb , and Ramesses II who attempted to recover the territories in modern Israel / Palestine , Lebanon and Syria that had been held in the Eighteenth Dynasty .
His reconquest led to the Battle of Qadesh , where he led the Egyptian armies against the army of the Hittite king Muwatalli II .

PTOLEMAIC DYNASTY Section::::Ptolemaic Dynasty .
The second Hellenistic dynasty , the Ptolemies , ruled Egypt from 305 BC until Egypt became a province of Rome in 30 BC ( whenever two dates overlap , that means there was a co - regency ) .
The most famous member of this dynasty was Cleopatra VII , in modern times known simply as Cleopatra , who was successively the consort of Julius Caesar and , after Caesar 's death , of Mark Antony , having children with both of them .
Cleopatra strove to create a dynastic and political union between Egypt and Rome , but the assassination of Caesar and the defeat of Mark Antony doomed her plans .
Caesarion ( Ptolemy XV Philopator Philometor Caesar ) was the last king of the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt , and he reigned jointly with his mother Cleopatra VII of Egypt , from September 2 , 47 BC .
He was the eldest son of Cleopatra VII , and possibly the only son of Julius Caesar , after whom he was named .
Between the alleged death of Cleopatra , on August 12 , 30 BC , up to his own alleged death on August 23 , 30 BC , he was nominally the sole pharaoh .
It is tradition that he was hunted down and killed on the orders of Octavian , who would become the Roman emperor Augustus , but the historical evidence does not exist . !

Cleopatra VII had affairs with Roman Dictator Julius Caesar and Roman General Mark Antony , but it was not until after her suicide ( after Mark Antony was defeated by Octavian , who would later be Emperor Augustus ) that Egypt became a province of Rome in 30 BC .
Subsequent Roman Emperors were accorded the title of Pharaoh , although exclusively while in Egypt .
One Egyptian king - list lists the Roman Emperors as Pharaohs up to and including Decius .
