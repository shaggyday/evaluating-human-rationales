CONTACT FORCE
A contact force is any force that requires contact to occur .
Contact forces are ubiquitous and are responsible for most visible interactions between macroscopic collections of matter .
Pushing a car up a hill or kicking a ball or pushing a desk across a room are some of the everyday examples where contact forces are at work .
In the first case the force is continuously applied by the person on the car , while in the second case the force is delivered in a short impulse .
Contact forces are often decomposed into orthogonal components , one perpendicular to the surface(s ) in contact called the normal force , and one parallel to the surface(s ) in contact , called the friction force .
In the Standard Model of modern physics , the four fundamental forces of nature are known to be non - contact forces .
The strong and weak interaction primarily deal with forces within atoms , while gravitational effects are only obvious on an ultra - macroscopic scale .
Molecular and quantum physics show that the electromagnetic force is the fundamental interaction responsible for contact forces .
The interaction between macroscopic objects can be roughly described as resulting from the electromagnetic interactions between protons and electrons of the atomic constituents of these objects .
Everyday objects do not actually touch ; rather , contact forces are the result of the interactions of the electrons at or near the surfaces of the objects .
