EFFECT OF THE 2004 INDIAN OCEAN EARTHQUAKE ON THE MALDIVES
In the Maldives , 82 people were killed and 24 reported missing and presumed dead after it was hit by a tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on 26 December 2004 .
Two - thirds of the capital city Malé was flooded during the first hours of the day .
Outlying low - level atolls were badly affected , and some low - lying islands , including some of the major resorts , were submerged at the peak of the tsunami .
The government declared a state of national disaster and a special task force was set up to provide aid and supplies .
Rescue efforts were hampered by loss of communication capability with the over one thousand islands that compose the nation , as well as by the lack of disaster planning .
