SOFT - SHELL CRAB
Soft - shell crab is a culinary term for crabs that have recently molted their old exoskeleton and are still soft .
Soft - shells are removed from the water as soon as they molt to prevent any hardening of their shell .
This means that almost the entire animal can be eaten , rather than having to shell the animal to reach the meat .
The exceptions are the mouthparts , the gills and the abdomen , which , though edible when shells are very soft , are usually discarded ( " cleaned " ) .
The remaining , edible part of the crab is typically deep fried or saut√©ed .
In the United States , the main species is the blue crab , Callinectes sapidus , which appears in markets from April to September .
In the Deep South region of the United States , " Buster crab " is often a synonym for a plump , meaty soft - shell crab , this usage especially common in the culinary centers such as New Orleans and Charlotte .
This is despite the fact that the original meaning of Buster crab referred to either a soft - shell that had yet to complete molting , or to a soft - shell that had died before being provided to a seafood vendor , and was then consumed by the crabber .
In Japan , various species are used to make sushi such as maki - zushi or temaki - zushi .
The Japanese blue crab ( Portunus trituberculatus ) or the shore swimming crab ( Charybdis japonica ) is typically used .
In Italy , the soft - shell of the common Mediterranean crab is a delicacy typical of the Venetian lagoon ( called moeca in the local idiom ) .
Soft shell crabs can have the soft organs along the dorsal cavity removed during cleaning , or they can be left in for consumption .
In the latter case , along the US Atlantic coast , the customer asks the vendor to leave " the mustard " , referring to the yellow orange color of the liver - analogue , and the deep orange of any roe in a female crab .
