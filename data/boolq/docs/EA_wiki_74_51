FREEDOM WRITERS
Freedom Writers is a 2007 drama film written and directed by Richard LaGravenese and starring Hilary Swank , Scott Glenn , Imelda Staunton , Patrick Dempsey and Mario .
It is based on the book The Freedom Writers Diary by teacher Erin Gruwell who wrote the story based on Woodrow Wilson Classical High School in Long Beach , California .
The movie is also based on the DC program called City at Peace .
The title is a play on the term " Freedom Riders " , referring to the multiracial civil rights activists who tested the U.S. Supreme Court decision ordering the desegregation of interstate buses in 1961 .
The idea for the film came from journalist Tracey Durning , who made a documentary about Erin Gruwell for the ABC News program Primetime Live .
Durning served as co - executive producer of the film .
The film was dedicated to the memory of Armand Jones , who was killed after wrapping up Freedom Writers .
He was 18 and was shot to death in Anaheim , California after a confrontation with a man who robbed Jones of a necklace in a Denny 's restaurant .
PLOT Section::::Plot .
In 1994 , in Long Beach , California , Erin Gruwell ( Hilary Swank ) has been accepted to teach English for at - risk students at Woodrow Wilson High School , a once highly acclaimed school , but where racial tensions have increased since the Los Angeles Riots two years prior .
Erin struggles to connect to her students and she experiences numerous fights between some students , who are in rival gangs .
One night , Eva Benitez ( April L. Hernandez ) , her boyfriend , and a friend go to a convenience store .
Sindy ( Jaclyn Ngan ) , a Cambodian refugee , frequents the same convenience store .
Grant Rice ( Armand Jones ) , an African - American student at Woodrow Wilson , frustrated at losing an arcade game , demands a refund from the store owner .
As Grant storms out of the store , Eva 's boyfriend , Paco ( as retaliation for losing a fight against Grant that took place earlier during a gang fight at Woodrow Wilson ) , attempts a drive - by shooting to kill Grant , but misses accidentally killing Sindy 's boyfriend .
As a witness , Eva must testify at court ; she intends to guard " her own " in her testimony .
At school , Gruwell intercepts a racist drawing by one of her high school students and utilizes it to teach them about the Holocaust , most of whom have no knowledge of .
She gradually begins to earn their trust and buys them composition books to record their diaries , in which they talk about their experiences of being abused , seeing their friends die , and being evicted .
Determined to reform her high school students , Gruwell takes on two part - time jobs to pay for more books and spends a lot more time at school , much to the disappointment of her husband ( Patrick Dempsey ) .
Her students start to behave with respect and discover a lot more .
A transformation is specifically visible in one student , Marcus ( Jason Finn ) .
Gruwell invites various Jewish Holocaust survivors to talk with her class about their experiences and requires the students to attend a field trip to the Museum of Tolerance .
Meanwhile , her unique training methods are scorned by her colleagues and department chair Margaret Campbell ( Imelda Staunton ) .
The following school year comes , and Gruwell teaches her class ( now sophomores ) again , making it the second year that she is their teacher .
On the first day of semester , Gruwell makes her class do a " Toast for Change " , allowing everyone to open up about their struggles and what they wish to change about themselves .
Later on , the class makes enough money to have Miep Gies to arrive to the United States and tell her experience when she helped Anne Frank , her family , and the Van Pels hide from the Nazis ; she then also persuades the students that they are heroes and that they " within their own small ways , [ can ] turn on a small light in a dark room .
" These two events inspire Eva to break free of the demands of her father to always protect her own rather than tell the truth .
At Grant 's trial , she shocks the courtroom by revealing that Paco actually killed Sindy 's boyfriend in the store ; Grant is spared of being convicted and Sindy later forgives Eva .
On leaving the court , Eva is attacked and threatened but ultimately spared by members of her gang and ends up going to live with her aunt in order to keep herself safe .
Meanwhile , Gruwell asks her students to write their diaries in book form .
She compiles the entries and names it The Freedom Writers Diary .
Her husband divorces her and Margaret tells her she can not teach her kids for their junior year .
Gruwell fights this decision , eventually convincing the superintendent to permit her to teach her kids during their junior and senior years , much to their elation .
The film ends with a note that Gruwell successfully prepared numerous high school students to graduate high school and attend college , for many the first in their families to do so .
