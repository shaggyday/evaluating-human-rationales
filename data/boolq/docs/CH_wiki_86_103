BLUE ROSE
A blue rose is a flower of the genus Rosa ( family Rosaceae ) that presents blue - to - violet pigmentation instead of the more common red , white , or yellow .
Blue roses are often portrayed in literature and art as symbols of love , prosperity , or immortality .
However , because of genetic limitations , they do not exist in nature .
In 2004 , researchers used genetic modification to create roses that contain the blue pigment delphinidin .
So - called " blue roses " have been bred by conventional hybridization methods , but the results , such as " Blue Moon " , are more accurately described as lilac in color .
DYED ROSES
Section::::Dyed roses .
Since blue roses do not exist in nature , as roses lack the specific gene that has the ability to produce a " true blue " color , blue roses are traditionally created by dyeing white roses .
In a book entitled Kitāb al - filāḥah written by Ibn al-'Awwām al - Ishbīlī in Arabic in the 12th century , and translated into French by J. J. Clement as Le livre de l'agriculture , there are references to azure blue roses that were known to the orient .
These blue roses were made by placing a blue dye into the bark of the roots .
GENETICALLY ENGINEERED ROSES Section::::Genetically engineered roses .
Scientists have yet to produce a truly blue colored rose ; however , after thirteen years of collaborative research by an Australian company , Florigene , and a Japanese company , Suntory , a rose containing the blue pigment delphinidin was created in 2004 by genetic engineering of a white rose .
The company and press have described it as a blue rose , but it is lavender or pale mauve in color .
The genetic engineering involved three alterations — adding two genes , and interfering with another .
First , the researchers inserted a gene for the blue plant pigment delphinidin cloned from the pansy into a purplish - red Old Garden rose " Cardinal de Richelieu " , resulting in a dark burgundy rose .
The researchers then used RNA interference ( RNAi ) technology to depress all other color production by endogenous genes by blocking a crucial protein in color production , called dihydroflavonol 4-reductase ( DFR ) , and adding a variant of that protein that would not be blocked by the RNAi but that would allow the color of the delphinidin to show .
If the strategy worked perfectly , in theory it could produce a truly blue rose .
However , the RNAi did not completely knock out the activity of DFR , so the resulting flower still made some of its natural color , and so was a red - tinged blue – a mauve or lavender .
Additionally , rose petals are more acidic than pansy petals , and the pansy delphinidin in the transgenic roses is degraded by the acidity in the rose petals .
Further deepening the blue colour would therefore require further modifications , by traditional breeding or further genetic engineering , to make the rose less acidic .
As of 2008 , the GM roses were being grown in test batches at the Martino Cassanova seed institution in South Hampshire , according to company spokesman Atsuhito Osaka .
Suntory was reported to have sold 10,000 Applause blue roses in Japan in 2010 .
Prices were from 2,000 to 3,000 Yen or US$ 22 to 35 a stem .
The company announced the North American sales would commence in the fall of 2011 .
CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE Section::::Cultural significance .
In some cultures , blue roses are traditionally associated with " blue " royal blood , and thus the blue rose can also denote regal majesty and splendor .
Due to the absence in nature of blue roses , they have come to symbolise mystery and longing to attain the impossible , with some cultures going so far as to say that the holder of a blue rose will have his / her wishes granted .
In literature , they appear in Tennessee Williams ' play The Glass Menagerie , with Jim nicknaming Laura " Blue Roses " after mishearing her explain that she 'd been out of school with pleurosis .
They also appear in Joni Mitchell 's song " Roses Blue " , about the malevolent possibilities of the occult , on her 1969 album Clouds ( Joni Mitchell album ) ; in George R.R. Martin 's A Song of Ice and Fire , when Prince Rhaegar Targaryen presents a crown of such roses to Lady Lyanna Stark ; in The Thief of Bagdad ( 1940 film ) , where they cause any who breathe their fragrance to forget everything ; and in David Lynch 's Twin Peaks , during the description of a variety of top - secret cases that involve the supernatural .
