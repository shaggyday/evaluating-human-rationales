SALE OF THE CENTURY ( UK GAME SHOW )
Sale of the Century is a British game show based on a US game show of the same name .
It was first shown on ITV from 9 October 1971 to 6 November 1983 , hosted by Nicholas Parsons .
Special edition Celebrity Sale of the Century aired occasionally , starting on 2 January 1981 with Steve Jones as a host .
The first series was supposed to air only in the Anglia region , but it rolled out to other regions since 8 January 1972 and achieved full national coverage by the end of 10 May 1975 , at which point it was one of the most popular shows on the network – spawning the often - mocked catchphrase " and now , from Norwich , it 's the quiz of the week . "
Since Norwich was considered something of a backwater compared to London , it was often used ironically .
It has been revived twice : first on Sky Channel from 6 February 1989 to 3 October 1991 hosted by Peter Marshall and then on Challenge TV in 1997 hosted by Keith Chegwin .
RULES
( 1971–83 ; 1997 )
Section::::Rules ( 1971–83 ; 1997 ) .
The ITV and Challenge versions followed the rules of the original American version .
Three contestants start off with £ 15 ( £ 10 in the earliest series ) .
Questions are worth different values starting with £ 1 , increasing to £ 3 after the second instant bargain , and finally £ 5 after the fourth ; by the final two ITV series , the values started at £ 3 but increased to £ 5 after the fourth instant bargain .
The question is asked and players can buzz in at any time .
Correct answers add the money to their score and incorrect answers subtract the money from their score with only one player allowed to buzz in on each question .
If a contestant runs out of money at any time , they are eliminated from further play , but may remain in their seat for the remainder of the show .
INSTANT BARGAIN / INSTANT SALE Section::::Instant Bargain / Instant Sale .
At four points during gameplay ( later five ) , all contestants would be offered the opportunity to purchase merchandise at a bargain price .
The first player to buzz in after the prize was revealed purchased that prize .
( In so doing , a " losing " contestant might not advance to go shopping at the end of the show , but could leave the show with a considerable haul for one day 's play . )
In the early days , the prices of all prizes offered were expressed much as one would hear in a department store ( e.g. , £ 7.95 , £ 11.95 , £ 14.95 , £ 21.95 ) .
All prize values were rounded off to the nearest pound before being subtracted from the score of the player who purchased the prize ( later on , prizes were in full pounds , like £ 8 , £ 12 , £ 15 , £ 22 , and increased as the show progressed ) .
Each instant bargain was hidden behind a curtain ; the announcer would mention the price , and then the curtain would open as the prize was revealed .
If a contestant buzzed in before the curtain opened , it was declared " No Sale " , the contestant would have the price deducted from his / her score ( but not win the prize ) , and the other contestants could then buzz in .
Also during the early ITV series , an " Open Sale " was offered just before the commercial break , in which a number of smaller gifts were offered for less than £ 5 each .
In this situation , more than one player could buy a given gift , and a player could buy any or all of the prizes on offer .
They could even buy two or more of some items .
By 1982 , Open Sale had been replaced by an instant bargain .
The Challenge TV version kept the rules of the ITV version , except there was no " Open Sale " , and players were spotted £ 15 to start .
There were five rounds with questions being worth £ 1 in round one , £ 3 in rounds two and three , and £ 5 in rounds four and five .
Finally , the game ended with 60 seconds of £ 5 questions .
The player in the lead at the end of this round was declared the champion .
RULES
( 1989–91 ) Section::::Rules ( 1989–91 ) .
The Sky Channel version had rules that were based on Australia 's 1980–1988 format and America 's 1983–1989 format , with better prizes than before .
In this format , each player started with £ 20 , and each question was worth only £ 5 .
There were only three " Instant Sales " ( renamed Gift Shops ) , and only the player in the lead could buy .
The biggest change was the " Fame Game " : Here , a succession of increasingly larger clues were given to the identity of a famous person , place , or event .
In this round , players could buzz - in and answer at any time , with the player shut out for the remainder of the question if they gave an incorrect answer .
If one of the players buzzed - in and answered correctly , the contestant chose from a game board with nine squares .
If all three contestants failed to come up with a right answer , then nobody got to pick .
Once chosen , the space selected would be spun around to reveal either a relatively small prize ( typically appliances or furniture valued at around a weekly wage ) or a bonus money card , which added to the player 's score .
There were £ 10 , £ 15 , and £ 25 bonuses added each round ; in addition , in the third round was a " Wild Card " , which offered the choice of £ 100 or a chance to pick again .
The game ended with the Speed Round where the host would ask as many questions as possible within 60 seconds .
The player with the most money when time ran out won the game .
If there was a tie for the lead after the Speed Round , another question was asked of the tied players .
Answering this question awarded £ 5 and the win ; missing the question deducted £ 5 and lost the game .
SHOPPING Section::::Shopping .
The winning contestant would be given the opportunity to spend their cash total on at least one of four grand prizes at the " Sale of the Century " which almost always included a new car .
Originally , champions could buy prizes totaling no more than £ 1,000 ( £ 2,500 in the late 1970s ) .
From 1981 to 1983 , any champion who won the game with £ 140 or more could choose to purchase one of the lesser four prizes or correctly answer a possible four of five questions , with no risk , to win a car .
On the 1989–91 & 1997 versions , there were a series of six prizes ( five in 1997 ) and as the contestant 's score built up , it applied to the next highest prize , with a car again being the top prize , which was available for £ 585 ( £ 500 in 1997 ) .
Like the Australian and American versions , they could buy the prize and leave or risk it and come back .
However , unlike the Australian and American versions , there was no cash jackpot available or the chance to buy all the prizes on stage .
On all versions , losing contestants kept the money and prizes earned .
OTHER BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Section::::Other background information .
The series was one of the most consistently high - rating entertainment shows of the 1970s , gaining peak viewing figures of 20 million .
This original version of the show was restricted in the prize amount through then national agreements , meaning that the featured cars had to be below set limits .
The producers hence preferred to engage with foreign manufacturers to provide better value prize , often including top of the range Ladas .
On 22 December 1978 , an all - out strike at the BBC meant that 21.2 million viewers watched the programme , the highest ever rating for a game show produced by ITV .
By the time the original version ended , it had awarded 500 contestants over £ 500,000 in prizes .
Celebrity special aired occasionally from 2 January 1981 , with prizes won going to charities .
The show is often famed as having been the place that record producer Simon Cowell made his television debut .
The video ( of his appearance on the 1989 version ) is available on YouTube and extracts of it were shown during the National Television Awards whilst Cowell was receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award .
Cowell appeared on 2 episodes ( winning his first game ) and won only £ 20 worth of cooking utensils .
The show 's theme tune , composed by Peter Fenn , was entitled " Joyful Pete " , in tribute to the show 's original producer , Peter Joy .
