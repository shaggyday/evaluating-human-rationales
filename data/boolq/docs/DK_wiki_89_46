RULES OF THE EUROVISION SONG CONTEST
The official rules of the Eurovision Song Contest are long , technical , and ever - changing .
Many of the rules cover technical aspects of the television broadcast itself .
However , a few of the more important rules affecting the conduct and outcome of the Contest follow . NUMBER OF SONGS Section::::Number of songs .
Each country in the Eurovision Song Contest is entitled to enter just one song .
The contest final is limited to 26 songs , apart from in 2015 when 27 countries took part following what was initially meant to be a one - off invite to Australia .
Since 2016 , Australia have competed in the semi - finals .
They consist of the following :
* The " Big 5 " countries ( , , , , and the ) are rewarded with automatic spots in the final .
* The host country .
* 10 qualifiers from Semi - final 1 - held on the Tuesday before the contest .
* 10 qualifiers from Semi - final 2 - held on the Thursday before the contest .
At the first Contest , each country was allowed to submit two songs each with a maximum duration of three minutes .
Nowadays , it is still required that each song not exceed three minutes in length , although many artists record the song in a longer version , simply performing a shorter version at the Contest .
The number of participating countries has grown throughout the Contest 's history , and since 1993 the rules have been changed several times to both limit the number of finalists and to allow for participation by former Soviet and Yugoslav republics , Warsaw Pact nations and others .
NO PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED MUSIC Section::::No previously published music .
The entering song is also not allowed to be a cover version , and is not allowed to sample another artist 's work .
All songs must be completely original in terms of songwriting and instrumentation , and may not have been released publicly before 1 September of the year preceding .
If released publicly , it may only be released in the entrant country 's market until after the contest .
VOICES AND INSTRUMENTS Section::::Voices and instruments .
Artists shall perform live on stage , accompanied by a recorded backing - track which contains no vocals of any kind or any vocal imitations aiming at replacing or assisting the live / original voice of the Contestant(s ) .
The Host Broadcaster shall verify respect for this rule .
No entirely instrumental composition has ever been allowed in Eurovision contests .
Norway won the Eurovision Song Contest in 1995 with a song focused on its instrumentals , but was eligible for participation because some lyrics ( 22 words in total ) were added .
Latvia performed their act a cappella in 2006 , as did Belgium in 2011 .
Norway 's entry in the 2010 Contest , and Austria 's 2011 in the contest started a cappella but then the instruments started as well .
This rule also played a vital role in Moldova 's entry in 2010 , as SunStroke Project 's Epic Sax Guy became a worldwide internet phenomenon .
The group 's saxophonist , Sergey Stepanov , had to synchronize his movements with a pre - recorded track that was played during the live performance .
Live music has been banned in Eurovision performances since 1998 .
This rule remains to this day .
PERFORMERS Section::::Performers .
Current rules state that countries are allowed to have up to six performers on stage .
Performers must be aged 16 or older , on the day of the semi - final in the year of the Contest .
This rule was introduced in 1990 , as two contestants the year before had been 11 and 12 years old .
The introduction of this rule means that Sandra Kim , who was 13 when she won for Belgium in 1986 , will remain the youngest winner unless the age limit is lowered .
No restriction on the nationality of the performers exists , which has resulted in countries being represented by artists who are not nationals of that country .
One of the most well - known winning artists was Canadian Céline Dion who represented Switzerland in 1988 .
It should also be noted that the performer only needs to be 16 when the event takes place and not when they are selected , as proven when Lindsay Dracass was selected to represent the United Kingdom in 2001 and again when Triinu Kivilaan was selected to represent Switzerland in 2005 , despite both of these performers only being 15 at their respective times of selection .
In Dracass ' case , she had to be issued a special visa to enable her to travel to Copenhagen .
LANGUAGES
Section::::Languages .
From the first Contest in 1956 until 1965 , and again from 1973 until 1976 there was no restriction on language .
From 1966 until 1972 , and again from 1978 until 1998 , songs were required to be performed in a national language .
The national language rule was actually instituted shortly before the 1977 Contest , but some countries had already selected non - national language entries , and they were allowed to enter without any changes .
As of the 1999 Contest , the restriction was again lifted , and songs may be performed in any language .
As a result , many of the songs are performed partially or completely in English .
In 2003 , Belgium made full use of the so - termed free language rule , and entered a song , " Sanomi " , in an artificial language created especially for the song .
This proved successful as the country finished second , only two points behind Turkey .
The same tactic was used in 2006 by the Dutch entry Treble which is partially sung in an artificial language and once again by Belgium with their 2008 entry " O Julissi " .
DIALECTS AND REGIONAL LANGUAGES NOTES PER YEAR
Section::::Dialects and regional languages notes per year .
On some occasions , dialects of a language or a very rare language have been used in a song entry : * 1971 , 1996 , 2003 & 2012 - Austria sang in various dialects of German ( Viennese in 1971 , Vorarlbergisch in 1996 , Styrian in 2003 and Mühlviertel dialect in 2012 ) * 1972 –

Only the refrain of the song was in English .

LANGUAGE ISSUES AND ENGLISH - LANGUAGE PREVALENCE Section::::Language issues and English - language prevalence .
Many European countries were founded on ideas of linguistic unity and because of the sometimes unwelcome dominance of the English language in modern pop music , the language of a country 's Eurovision entry can be a contentious issue .
Some entries are performed in English to reach broader audiences , though this is sometimes looked upon as unpatriotic .
In recent years up to 2007 the number of non - English language entrants has decreased , with mostly Israel , Ex - Yugoslavia(Mainly Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina ) and , French language countries , Italy , Spain and Portugal performing in their native language .
In terms of recent Contest performance , most non - English songs have been far less successful than those in English .
Until 2007 , the last wholly non - English language winner was Israel 's Dana International , who performed Diva in Hebrew in 1998 .
The 2004 winner , Wild Dances performed by Ruslana , was partially sung in Ukrainian .
After 2007 when Marija Šerifović won , singing in Serbian , the number of non - English contestants increased again in 2008 - almost half of the performers contested in their native language .
The next non - English language winner , Amar Pelos Dois , performed in 2017 by Salvador Sobral , was sung entirely in Portuguese .
In some cases , the lyrics are written and recorded in two different versions ( usually English and a national language ) or a single multi - language version .
Examples include : * Denmark , where the national selection procedure allows freedom of language , but if the winning song from their national competition is in Danish , it must be re - written in English for the competition .
* Sweden , even as there is no outspoken rule the song must be translated into English , it has usually been done so ( if allowed in the rules ) , as in 1965 , 1973 , 1974 , 1975 , 1999 , 2000 , 2001 , 2004 , and 2006 .
* Macedonia , who held a vote to decide whether their 2005 song should be in English or Macedonian .
* France , whose entry in 2001 was performed partially in French and partially in English .
The 2007 entry was sung in Franglais .
The French entry in 2008 caused controversy as it was all in English and people were unhappy about being represented with an English song .
In 2012 , Anggun performed her song Echo partly in English but mostly in French .
The same happened in 2016 , when Amir performed the chorus of his song " J'ai cherché " in English and the rest of the song in French .
In 2017 , Alma performs her song " Requiem " partly in English , but mostly in French as well .
* Albania , only allows songs performed in Albanian at " Festival i Këngës " , their pre - selection round for the Contest .
Afterwards , they often translate the lyrics of their entrant to English .
* Italy , in the Festival della canzone di Sanremo ( the Italian Eurovision selections festival )
the song must be sing in Italian , the artist theoretically can choose at Eurovision to sing an English translated song , but nobody has chosen to sing the song at Eurovision entirely in English yet ( at maximum some stanzas were translated in English ) .
* Serbia after failing to qualify in 2017 with a song in English Serbian artist must sing in Serbian at their national selection
*
Iceland makes their artists sing in Icelandic for their national selection but they can translate afterward which is the preferred way as with Ari in 2018 ,
Svala in 2017 , Greta Salóme in 2012 and 2016 , Maria Olafs in 2015 .
RULE CHANGES BY YEAR
* 1956 First contest - each of the seven competing countries were obliged to hold a national selection final to choose their entries .
* 1957 After Italy 's song lasted 5:09 minutes , rule changes were introduced to limit maximum song times to three minutes - which still operates .
* 1958 The convention of the winning country being invited to host the following year 's contest is introduced .
However , several countries declined the opportunity in subsequent years .
* 1959 Professional publishers or composers were no longer allowed in the national juries .
* 1962 Voting system change .
Each country had 10 jury members who awarded their three favourite songs 3 , 2 , and 1 points in order .
Previously each of the ten jury members awarded 1 point to their favourite song .
* 1963 Jury sizes doubled to 20 and points awarded were 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 and 1 .
* 1964 Jury sizes revert to 10 , and points are now 5 , 3 and 1 .
It becomes possible for a unanimous jury to award all 9 points to one song - but this does not occur .
It was also possible to give 6 and 3 points to two songs , this happened only in 1965 , when the Belgian jury gave 6 points to the United Kingdom and 3 points to Italy .
* 1966 Countries must now sing in one of its national languages .
* 1967 Scoring system reverts to the one used between 1957 and 1961 .
Each of the ten jurors awards a single point to their favourite song -
so in theory a country could be awarded all 10 points , although the highest tally allocated under this system was 9 by the Belgian jury for Dana 's 1970 winning song .
* 1968
Although not a rule change , the contest is broadcast in colour by 6 of the 17 countries competing .
It has been available in colour to broadcasters each year since .
* 1970
Following a four - way tie in the 1969 contest , a tie - break rule was introduced with provision for a sing - off and a show of hands from the juries to elect a winner .
* 1971 Another voting system change .
Each country had two jury members , one under 25 and one over 25 .
They each awarded 1 to 5 points for each song .
This created an issue where some juries gave fewer points out than others .
The rule permitting groups of up to six performers on stage was introduced .
Previously , entrants could only perform solo or as a duet .
* 1973
The rule forcing countries to sing in one of its national languages is relaxed - however this is only in place for 4 years .
* 1974 The scoring system used between 1957 and 1961 and between 1968 and 1970 is restored for a third time .
* 1975 The scoring system that still operates today is introduced .
Each jury would now give 12 points to the best song , 10 to the second best , then 8 to the third , 7 to the fourth , 6 to the fifth and so forth until the tenth best song ( in the jury 's opinion ) received a single point .
Unlike today , the points were not given in order ( from 1 up to 12 ) , but in the order the songs were performed .
* 1976
As the cost of staging the contest increases , a new rule was introduced that , in future , each participating broadcaster would have to pay a part of the cost of staging the contest .
* 1977 Countries must again revert to singing in their own national languages .
* 1980 The jury spokesperson now read the points out in numerical order ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 10 and 12 ) rather than in song order .
* 1987
As the number of countries reached a record of 22 , the EBU imposed a limit on the number of countries competing .
Although set at 22 , this limit has varied slightly over the years .
* 1989
Following the closeness of the result at the 1988 Contest , the tie break rule was amended .
If a tie was to occur the winner would be declared on the most 12 points , if that still failed to separate them , the one with the most 10 points .
* 1990
Following Sandra Kim 's 1986 win for Belgium at the age of just 13 and controversy over two performers in 1989 being just 11 and 12 years old , a restriction on competitor 's age was introduced .
The minimum age is now 16 at the time of the event .
* 1993
After the breakup of Yugoslavia , a pre - qualifying round was introduced .
* 1994 Relegation had to be introduced to accommodate the ever - increasing number of countries wishing to compete .
Initially the bottom five countries from 1993 would not get an entrant at the 1994 contest .
The relegation rules would change slightly over subsequent years .
* 1997 After controversy over a 1996 pre - selection procedure ( similar to 1993 ) which resulted in Germany being omitted from the contest , the selection procedure changed to allow only the countries with the best average scores over the previous four years .
* 1997 Televoting was trialled in five countries and would become the preferred method of voting from 1998 .
* 1999 Restrictions are lifted again allowing countries to sing in any language .
* 1999 Countries preferences to use backing tracks virtually leads to the abolition of orchestras .
Live music became optional and all broadcasters since 1999 have declined to use an orchestra .
In 2004 , all live music was banned ; even artists on stage were not allowed to play their instruments live , even if they explicitly voiced their wish to do so .
This live music prohibition is still in place .
* 2000
The " Big Four " rule is introduced giving France , Germany , Spain and the United Kingdom automatic entry in the contest regardless of previous performance .
In 2011 Italy made comeback becoming a " Big Five " member .
* 2004 Relegation rules , which varied slightly since 1994 were dropped and a semi - final was introduced .
Countries eliminated in the semi - final were still allowed to vote on the final , so the convention of reading the scores in both French and English were dropped .
The spokesperson would now read the score in one language with presenters repeating in the other language .
* 2006
Jury spokespersons no longer read out all the points from 1 up to 12 .
Instead the scores up to 7 points are displayed briefly before the spokesperson reads out their 8 , 10 and 12 point allocations .
* 2008
With a record entry of 43 , a second semi - final was introduced .
Juries were used to allocate a wild - card place in the final from each of the semi - finals .
25 countries now compete in the final .
* 2009
After criticism of the voting system after the 2007 Contest , changes in the voting procedure were made with the re - introduction of a national jury alongside televoting ( split 50/50 ) .
This format would be extended to the semi - finals in 2010 .
* 2010 People can vote from the first song until the end of vote .
* 2012 The 15-minute televoting window is restored due to criticism of the voting method after the 2011 contest .
26 countries now compete in the final , because Italy made comeback in 2011 and became a " Big Five " country along with Germany , France , Spain and United Kingdom .
* 2013
The format of the jury / televoting result is changed slightly in that all songs are now ranked instead of being given a score in each method , this is then merged and the ten highest ranked songs receive points in the usual manner .
Also , for the first time , the running order in all three shows is determined by producers of the show instead of a random draw , which is supposed to give each song competing a fair chance of success .
* 2015 The EBU considers the possibility of inviting countries outside of the European Broadcasting Area or the Council of Europe to participate in future editions of the contest .
The first of such " guest nations " was Australia in 2015 .
This also bumps up the number of countries competing in the final to 27 .
* 2016 A new voting system is introduced .
Entries now receive one set of points from the jury and one set of points from televoting .
First , the jury votes are given in the usual way , giving 1 up to 12 points but with only the 12th being read by the spokesperson .
Then , the televotes are read by the presenters , starting with the country receiving the least televotes and ending with the country that received the most televotes , so the winner is not known until the end of the show .
In addition , the number of countries competing in the final is reduced back to 26 as Australia now competes in the semi - final .
