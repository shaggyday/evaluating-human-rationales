WORKING TIME
Working time is the period of time that a person spends at paid labor .
Unpaid labor such as personal housework or caring for children or pets is not considered part of the working week .
Many countries regulate the work week by law , such as stipulating minimum daily rest periods , annual holidays , and a maximum number of working hours per week .
Working time may vary from person to person , often depending on economic conditions , location , culture , lifestyle choice , and the profitability of the individual 's livelihood .
For example , someone who is supporting children and paying a large mortgage will need to work more hours to meet basic costs of living than someone of the same earning power without children .
In developed countries like the United Kingdom , some workers are part - time because they are unable to find full - time work , but many choose reduced work hours to care for children or other family ; some choose it simply to increase leisure time .
Standard working hours ( or normal working hours ) refers to the legislation to limit the working hours per day , per week , per month or per year .
If an employee needs to work overtime , the employer will need to pay overtime payments to employees as required in the law .
Generally speaking , standard working hours of countries worldwide are around 40 to 44 hours per week ( but not everywhere : from 35 hours per week in France to up to 112 hours per week in North Korean labor camps ) and the additional overtime payments are around 25 % to 50 % above the normal hourly payments .
Maximum working hours refers to the maximum working hours of an employee .
The employee can not work more than the level specified in the maximum working hours law .
HUNTER - GATHERER Section::::Hunter - gatherer .
Since the 1960s , the consensus among anthropologists , historians , and sociologists has been that early hunter - gatherer societies enjoyed more leisure time than is permitted by capitalist and agrarian societies ; for instance , one camp of !
Kung Bushmen was estimated to work two - and - a - half days per week , at around 6 hours a day .
Aggregated comparisons show that on average the working day was less than five hours .
Subsequent studies in the 1970s examined the Machiguenga of the Upper Amazon and the Kayapo of northern Brazil .
These studies expanded the definition of work beyond purely hunting - gathering activities , but the overall average across the hunter - gatherer societies he studied was still below 4.86 hours , while the maximum was below 8 hours .
Popular perception is still aligned with the old academic consensus that hunter - gatherers worked far in excess of modern humans ' forty - hour week .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The industrial revolution made it possible for a larger segment of the population to work year - round , because this labor was not tied to the season and artificial lighting made it possible to work longer each day .
Peasants and farm laborers moved from rural areas to work in urban factories , and working time during the year increased significantly .
Before collective bargaining and worker protection laws , there was a financial incentive for a company to maximize the return on expensive machinery by having long hours .
Records indicate that work schedules as long as twelve to sixteen hours per day , six to seven days per week were practiced in some industrial sites .
Over the 20th century , work hours shortened by almost half , mostly due to rising wages brought about by renewed economic growth , with a supporting role from trade unions , collective bargaining , and progressive legislation .
The workweek , in most of the industrialized world , dropped steadily , to about 40 hours after World War II .
The limitation of working hours is also proclaimed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , and European Social Charter .
The decline continued at a faster pace in Europe : for example , France adopted a 35-hour workweek in 2000 .
In 1995 , China adopted a 40-hour week , eliminating half - day work on Saturdays ( though this is not widely practiced ) .
Working hours in industrializing economies like South Korea , though still much higher than the leading industrial countries , are also declining steadily .
Technology has also continued to improve worker productivity , permitting standards of living to rise as hours decline .
In developed economies , as the time needed to manufacture goods has declined , more working hours have become available to provide services , resulting in a shift of much of the workforce between sectors .
Economic growth in monetary terms tends to be concentrated in health care , education , government , criminal justice , corrections , and other activities that are regarded as necessary for society rather than those that contribute directly to the production of material goods .
In the mid-2000s , the Netherlands was the first country in the industrialized world where the overall average working week dropped to less than 30 hours .
GRADUAL DECREASE IN WORKING HOURS
Section::::Gradual decrease in working hours .
Most countries in the developed world have seen average hours worked decrease significantly .
For example , in the U.S in the late 19th century it was estimated that the average work week was over 60 hours per week .
Today the average hours worked in the U.S. is around 33 , with the average man employed full - time for 8.4 hours per work day , and the average woman employed full - time for 7.9 hours per work day .
The front runners for lowest average weekly work hours are the Netherlands with 27 hours , and France with 30 hours .
At current rates the Netherlands is set to become the first country to reach an average work week under 21 hours .
In a 2011 report of 26 OECD countries , Germany had the lowest average working hours per week at 25.6 hours .
The New Economics Foundation has recommended moving to a 21-hour standard work week to address problems with unemployment , high carbon emissions , low well - being , entrenched inequalities , overworking , family care , and the general lack of free time .
Actual work week lengths have been falling in the developed world .
Factors that have contributed to lowering average work hours and increasing standard of living have been :
* Technological advances in efficiency such as mechanization , robotics and information technology .
*
The increase of women equally participating in making income as opposed to previously being commonly bound to homemaking and childrearing exclusively .
* Dropping fertility rates leading to fewer hours needed to be worked to support children .
Recent articles supporting a four - day week have argued that reduced work hours would increase consumption and invigorate the economy .
However , other articles state that consumption would decrease .
Other arguments for the four - day week include improvements to workers ' level of education ( due to having extra time to take classes and courses ) and improvements to workers ' health ( less work - related stress and extra time for exercise ) .
Reduced hours also save money on day care costs and transportation , which in turn helps the environment with less carbon - related emissions .
These benefits increase workforce productivity on a per - hour basis .
WORKWEEK STRUCTURE
Section::::Workweek structure .
The structure of the work week varies considerably for different professions and cultures .
Among salaried workers in the western world , the work week often consists of Monday to Friday or Saturday with the weekend set aside as a time of personal work and leisure .
Sunday is set aside in the western world because it is the Christian sabbath .
The traditional American business hours are 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. , Monday to Friday , representing a workweek of five eight - hour days comprising 40 hours in total .
These are the origin of the phrase 9-to-5 , used to describe a conventional and possibly tedious job .
Negatively used , it connotes a tedious or unremarkable occupation .
The phrase also indicates that a person is an employee , usually in a large company , rather than an entrepreneur or self - employed .
More neutrally , it connotes a job with stable hours and low career risk , but still a position of subordinate employment .
The actual time at work often varies between 35 and 48 hours in practice due to the inclusion , or lack of inclusion , of breaks .
In many traditional white collar positions , employees were required to be in the office during these hours to take orders from the bosses , hence the relationship between this phrase and subordination .
Workplace hours have become more flexible , but the phrase is still commonly used .
Several countries have adopted a workweek from Monday morning until Friday noon , either due to religious rules ( observation of shabbat in Israel whose workweek is Sunday to Friday afternoon ) or the growing predominance of a 35–37.5 hour workweek in continental Europe .
Several of the Muslim countries have a standard Sunday through Thursday or Saturday through Wednesday workweek leaving Friday for religious observance , and providing breaks for the daily prayer times .

Section::::European countries .
In most European Union countries , working time is gradually decreasing .
The European Union 's working time directive imposes a 48-hour maximum working week that applies to every member state except the United Kingdom and Malta ( which have an opt - out , meaning that UK - based employees may work longer than 48 hours if they wish , but they can not be forced to do so ) .
France has enacted a 35-hour workweek by law , and similar results have been produced in other countries through collective bargaining .
A major reason for the lower annual hours worked in Europe is a relatively high amount of paid annual leave .
Fixed employment comes with four to six weeks of holiday as standard .
In the UK , for example , full - time employees are entitled to 28 days of paid leave a year .
FRANCE Section::::France .
France experimented in 2000 a sharp cut of legal or statutory working time of the employees in the private and public sector from 39 hours a week to 35 hours a week , with the stated goal to fight against rampant unemployment at that time .
The Law 2000 - 37 on working time reduction is also referred to as the Aubry Law , according to the name of the Labor Minister at that time .
Employees can ( and do ) work more than 35 hours a week , yet in this case firms must pay them overtime bonuses .
If the bonus is determined through collective negotiations , it can not be lower than 10 % .
If no agreement on working time is signed , the legal bonus must be of 25 % for the first 8 hours , than goes up to 50 % for the rest .
Including overtime , the maximum working time can not exceed 48 hours per week , and should not exceed 44 hours per week over 12 weeks in a row .
In France the labor law also regulates the minimum working hours :
part time jobs should not allow for less than 24 hours per week without a branch collective agreement .
These agreements can allow for less , under tight conditions .
According to the official statistics ( DARES ) , after the introduction of the law on working time reduction , actual hours per week performed by full time employed , fell from 39.6 hours in 1999 , to a trough of 37.7 hours in 2002 , then gradually went back to 39.1 hours in 2005 .
In 2016 working hours were of 39.1 ..
SOUTH KOREA Section::::South Korea .
South Korea has the fastest shortening working time in the OECD , which is the result of the government 's proactive move to lower working hours at all levels to increase leisure and relaxation time , which introduced the mandatory forty - hour , five - day working week in 2004 for companies with over 1,000 employees .
Beyond regular working hours , it is legal to demand up to 12 hours of overtime during the week , plus another 16 hours on weekends .
The 40-hour workweek expanded to companies with 300 employees or more in 2005 , 100 employees or more in 2006 , 50 or more in 2007 , 20 or more in 2008 and a full inclusion to all workers nationwide in July 2011 .
The government has continuously increased public holidays to 16 days in 2013 , more than the 10 days of the United States and double that of the United Kingdom 's 8 days .
Despite those efforts , South Korea 's work hours are still relatively long , with an average 2,163 hours per year in 2012 .
JAPAN Section::::Japan .
Work hours in Japan are decreasing , but many Japanese still work long hours .
Recently , Japan 's Ministry of Health , Labor and Welfare ( MHLW ) issued a draft report recommending major changes to the regulations that govern working hours .
The centerpiece of the proposal is an exemption from overtime pay for white - collar workers .
Japan has enacted an 8-hour work day and 40-hour work week ( 44 hours in specified workplaces ) .
The overtime limits are : 15 hours a week , 27 hours over two weeks , 43 hours over four weeks , 45 hours a month , 81 hours over two months and 120 hours over three months ; however , some workers get around these restrictions by working several hours a day without ' clocking in ' whether physically or metaphorically .
The overtime allowance should not be lower than 125 % and not more than 150 % of the normal hourly rate .
MEXICO Section::::Mexico .
Mexican laws mandate a maximum of 48 hours of work per week , but they are rarely observed or enforced due to loopholes in the law , the volatility of labor rights in Mexico , and its underdevelopment relative to other members countries of the Organisation for Economic Co - operation and Development ( OECD ) .
Indeed , private sector employees often work overtime without receiving overtime compensation .
Fear of unemployment and threats by employers explain in part why the 48-hour work week is disregarded .. COLOMBIA Section::::Colombia .
Articles 161 to 167 of the Substantive Work Code in Colombia provide for a maximum of 48 hours of work a week .
AUSTRALIA Section::::Australia .
In Australia , between 1974 and 1997 no marked change took place in the average amount of time spent at work by Australians of " prime working age " ( that is , between 25 and 54 years of age ) .
Throughout this period , the average time spent at work by prime working - age Australians ( including those who did not spend any time at work ) remained stable at between 27 and 28 hours per week .
This unchanging average , however , masks a significant redistribution of work from men to women .
Between 1974 and 1997 , the average time spent at work by prime working - age Australian men fell from 45 to 36 hours per week , while the average time spent at work by prime working - age Australian women rose from 12 to 19 hours per week .
In the period leading up to 1997 , the amount of time Australian workers spent at work outside the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays also increased .
In 2009 , a rapid increase in the number of working hours was reported in a study by The Australia Institute .
The study found the average Australian worked 1855 hours per year at work .
According to Clive Hamilton of The Australia Institute , this surpasses even Japan .
The Australia Institute believes that Australians work the highest number of hours in the developed world .
From January 1 , 2010 , Australia enacted a 38-hour workweek in accordance with the Fair Work Act 2009 , with an allowance for additional hours as overtime .
The vast majority of full - time employees in Australia work additional overtime hours .
A 2015 survey found that of Australia 's 7.7 million full - time workers , 5 million put in more than 40 hours a week , including 1.4 million who worked more than 50 hours a week and 270,000 who put in more than 70 hours .
UNITED STATES Section::::United States .
In 2016 , the average man employed full - time worked 8.4 hours per work day , and the average woman employed full - time worked 7.8 hours per work day .
There is no mandatory minimum amount of paid time off for sickness or holiday but the majority of full time civilian workers have access to paid vacation time .
RECENT HISTORY Section::::Recent history .
By 1946 the [ [ United States ] ]
[ [ United States federal governmentgovernment ] ] had inaugurated the 40-hour work week for all federal employees .
Beginning in 1950 , under the Truman Administration , the United States became the first known industrialized nation to explicitly ( albeit secretly ) and permanently forswear a reduction of working time .
Given the military - industrial requirements of the Cold War , the authors of the then secret [ [ National Security Council Report 68 ] ]
( NSC-68 ) proposed the US government undertake a massive permanent national economic expansion that would let it " siphon off " a part of the economic activity produced to support an ongoing military buildup to contain the [ [ Soviet Union ] ] .
In his 1951 Annual Message to the Congress , President Truman stated : In terms of manpower , our present defense targets will require an increase of nearly one million men and women in the armed forces within a few months , and probably not less than four million more in defense production by the end of the year .
This means that an additional 8 percent of our labor force , and possibly much more , will be required by direct defense needs by the end of the year .
These manpower needs will call both for increasing our labor force by reducing unemployment and drawing in women and older workers , and for lengthening hours of work in essential industries .
According to the [ [ Bureau of Labor Statistics ] ] , the average non - farm private sector employee worked 34.5 hours per week as of June 2012 .
As President Truman 's 1951 message had predicted , the share of working women rose from 30 percent of the labor force in 1950 to 47 percent by 2000 – growing at a particularly rapid rate during the 1970s .
According to a [ [ Bureau of Labor Statistics ] ] report issued May 2002 , " In 1950 , the overall participation rate of women was 34 percent . ...
The rate rose to 38 percent in 1960 , 43 percent in 1970 , 52 percent in 1980 , and 58 percent in 1990 and reached 60 percent by 2000 .
The overall labor force participation rate of women is projected to attain its highest level in 2010 , at 62 percent .
" The inclusion of women in the work force can be seen as symbolic of social progress as well as of increasing American productivity and hours worked .
Between 1950 and 2007 official price inflation was measured to 861 percent .
President Truman , in his 1951 message to Congress , predicted correctly that his military buildup " will cause intense and mounting inflationary pressures .
" Using the data provided by the United State Bureau of Labor Statistics , Erik Rauch has estimated productivity to have increased by nearly 400 % .
According to Rauch , " if productivity means anything at all , a worker should be able to earn the same standard of living as a 1950 worker in only 11 hours per week . "
In the [ [ United States ] ] , the working time for upper - income professionals has increased compared to 1965 , while total annual working time for low - skill , low - income workers has decreased .
This effect is sometimes called the " leisure gap " .
The average working time of married couples – of both spouses taken together – rose from 56 hours in 1969 to 67 hours in 2000 .
OVERTIME RULES
Section::::Overtime rules .
Many professional workers put in longer hours than the forty - hour standard .
In professional industries like investment banking and large law firms , a forty - hour workweek is considered inadequate and may result in job loss or failure to be promoted .
Medical residents in the United States routinely work [ [ Medical resident work hourslong hours as part of their training ] ] .
Workweek policies are not uniform in the U.S.
Many compensation arrangements are legal , and three of the most common are wage , commission , and salary payment schemes .
Wage earners are compensated on a per - hour basis , whereas salaried workers are compensated on a per - week or per - job basis , and commission workers get paid according to how much they produce or sell .
Under most circumstances , wage earners and lower - level employees may be legally required by an employer to work more than forty hours in a week ; however , they are paid extra for the additional work .
Many salaried workers and commission - paid sales staff are not covered by overtime laws .
These are generally called " exempt " positions , because they are exempt from federal and state laws that mandate extra pay for extra time worked .
The rules are complex , but generally exempt workers are executives , professionals , or sales staff .
For example , school teachers are not paid extra for working extra hours .
Business owners and independent contractors are considered self - employed , and none of these laws apply to them .
Generally , workers are paid [ [ time - and - a - half ] ] , or 1.5 times the worker 's base wage , for each hour of work past forty .
California also applies this rule to work in excess of eight hours per day , but exemptions and exceptions significantly limit the applicability of this law .
In some states , firms are required to pay double - time , or twice the base rate , for each hour of work past 60 , or each hour of work past 12 in one day in California , also subject to numerous exemptions and exceptions .
This provides an [ [ incentive ] ] for companies to limit working time , but makes these additional hours more desirable for the worker .
It is not uncommon for overtime hours to be accepted voluntarily by wage - earning workers .
[ [ Trade unionUnions ] ] often treat overtime as a desirable commodity when negotiating how these opportunities shall be partitioned among union members .
BRAZIL
Section::::Brazil .
The work time in [ [ Brazil ] ] is 44 hours per week , usually 8 hours per day and 4 hours on Saturday or 8.8 hours per day .
On duty / no meal break jobs are 6 hours per day .
Public servants work 40 hours a week .
It is worth noting that in Brazil meal time is not usually counted as work .
There is a 1-hour break for lunch and work schedule is typically 8:00 or 9:00–noon , 13:00–18:00 .
In larger cities people have lunch meal on / near the work site , while in smaller cities a sizable fraction of the employees might go home for lunch .
A 30-day vacation is mandatory by law and there are about 13 to 15 holidays a year , depending on the municipality .
CHINA Section::::China .
China adopted a 40-hour week , eliminating half - day work on Saturdays .
However , this rule has never been truly enforced , and unpaid or underpaid overtime working is common practice in China .
Traditionally , Chinese have worked long hours , and this has led to many deaths from overwork , with the state media reporting in 2014 that 600,000 people were dying annually from overwork .
Despite this , work hours have reportedly been falling for about three decades due to rising productivity , better labor laws , and the spread of the two - day weekend .
The trend has affected both factories and white - collar companies that have been responding to growing demands for easier work schedules .
HONG KONG Section::::Hong Kong .
Hong Kong has no legislation regarding maximum and normal working hours .
The average weekly working hours of full - time employees in Hong Kong is 49 hours .
According to the Price and Earnings Report 2012 conducted by [ [ UBS ] ] , while the global and regional average were 1,915 and 2,154 hours per year respectively , the average working hours in Hong Kong is 2,296 hours per year , which ranked the fifth longest yearly working hours among 72 countries under study .
In addition , from the survey conducted by the Public Opinion Study Group of the University of Hong Kong , 79 % of the respondents agree that the problem of overtime work in Hong Kong is " severe " , and 65 % of the respondents support the legislation on the maximum working hours .
In Hong Kong , 70 % of surveyed do not receive any overtime remuneration .
These show that people in Hong Kong concerns the working time issues .
As Hong Kong implemented the minimum wage law in May 2011 , the Chief Executive , [ [ Donald Tsang ] ] , of the Special Administrative Region pledged that the government will standardize working hours in Hong Kong .
On 26 November 2012 , the Labour Department of the HKSAR released the " Report of the policy study on standard working hours " .
The report covers three major areas , including : ( 1 ) the regimes and experience of other places in regulating working hours , ( 2 ) latest working time situations of employees in different sectors , and ( 3 ) estimation of the possible impact of introducing standard working hour in Hong Kong .
Under the selected parameters , from most loosen to most stringent , the estimated increase in labour cost vary from 1.1 billion to 55 billion HKD , and affect 957,100 ( 36.7 % of total employees ) to 2,378,900 ( 91.1 % of total ) employees .
Various sectors of the community show concerns about the standard working hours in Hong Kong .
The points are summarized as below : OPINIONS FROM VARIOUS SECTORS LABOR ORGANIZATIONS Section::::Opinions from various sectors .
Section::::Labor organizations .
Hong Kong Catholic Commission For Labour Affairs urges the government to legislate the standard working hours in Hong Kong , and suggests a 44 hours standard , 54 hours maximum working hours in a week .
The organization thinks that long working time adversely affects the family and social life and health of employees ; it also indicates that the current Employment Ordinance does not regulate overtime pays , working time limits nor rest day pays , which can protect employees rights .
BUSINESSES AND RELATED ORGANIZATIONS Section::::Businesses and related organizations .
Generally , business sector agrees that it is important to achieve work - life balance , but does not support a legislation to regulate working hours limit .
They believe " standard working hours " is not the best way to achieve work - life balance and the root cause of the long working hours in Hong Kong is due to insufficient labor supply .
The Managing Director of Century Environmental Services Group , Catherine Yan , said " Employees may want to work more to obtain a higher salary due to financial reasons .
If standard working hour legislation is passed , employers will need to pay a higher salary to employees , and hence the employers may choose to segment work tasks to employer more part time employees instead of providing overtime pay to employees . "
She thinks this will lead to a situation that the employees may need to find two part - time jobs to earn their living , making them wasting more time on transportation from one job to another .
The Chairman of the [ [ Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce ] ] , [ [ Chow Chung - kong ] ] believes that it is so difficult to implement standard working hours that apply " across - the - board " , specifically , to accountants and barristers .
In addition , he believes that standard working hours may decrease individual employees ' working hours and would not increase their actual income .
It may also lead to an increase of number of part - timers in the labor market .
According to a study conducted jointly by the Business , Economic and Public Affairs Research Centre and Enterprise and Social Development Research Centre of Hong Kong Shue Yan University , 16 % surveyed companies believe that a standard working hours policy can be considered , and 55 % surveyed think that it would be difficult to implement standard working hours in businesses .
Employer representative in the Labour Advisory Board , Stanley Lau , said that standard working hours will completely alter the business environment of Hong Kong , affect [ [ small and medium enterprise ] ] and weaken competitiveness of businesses .
He believes that the government can encourage employers to pay overtime salary , and there is no need to regulate standard working hours .
POLITICAL PARTIES Section::::Political parties .
On 17–18 October 2012 , the [ [ Legislative Council of Hong KongLegislative Council ] ]
members in Hong Kong debated on the motion " legislation for the regulation of working hours " .
[ [ Cheung Kwok - che ] ] proposed the motion "
That is the Council urges the Government to introduce a bill on the regulation of working hours within this legislative session , the contents of which must include the number of standard weekly hours and overtime pay " .
As the motion was not passed by both [ [ functional constituencies ] ]
and [ [ geographical constituencies ] ] , it was negatived .
The [ [ Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions ] ] suggested a standard 44-hour work week with overtime pay of 1.5 times the usual pay .

[ [ Elizabeth Quat ] ] of the [ [ Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong ] ]
( DAB ) , believed that standard working hours were a labor policy and was not related to family - friendly policies .
The Vice President of Young DAB , Wai - hung Chan , stated that standard working hours would bring limitations to small and medium enterprises .
He thought that the government should discuss the topic with the public more before legislating standard working hours .
The [ [ Democratic Party ( Hong Kong)Democratic Party ] ] suggested a 44-hour standard work week and compulsory overtime pay to help achieve the balance between work , rest and entertainment of people in Hong Kong .
The [ [ Labour Party ( Hong Kong)Labour Party ] ] believed regulating working hours could help achieve a work - life balance .

[ [ Poon Siu - ping ] ] of [ [ Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions ] ]

GOVERNMENT Section::::Government .
[ [ Matthew Cheung Kin - chung ] ] , the Secretary for [ [ Labour and Welfare Bureau ] ] , said the [ [ Executive Council of Hong KongExecutive Council ] ] has already received the government report on working hours in June , and the Labour Advisory Board and the LegCo 's Manpower Panel will receive the report in late November and December respectively .
On 26 November 2012 , the Labour Department released the report , and the report covered the regimes and experience of practicing standard working hours in selected regions , current work hour situations in different industries , and the impact assessment of standard working hours .
Also , Matthew Cheung mentioned that the government will form a select committee by first quarter of 2013 , which will include government officials , representative of labor unions and employers ' associations , academics and community leaders , to investigate the related issues .
He also said that it would " perhaps be unrealistic " to put forward a bill for standard working hours in the next one to two years .
ACADEMICS Section::::Academics .
Yip Siu - fai , Professor of the Department of Social Work and Social Administration of [ [ HKU ] ] , has noted that professions such as nursing and accountancy have long working hours and that this may affect people 's social life .
He believes that standard working hours could help to give Hong Kong more family - friendly workplaces and to increase fertility rates .
Randy Chiu , Professor of the Department of Management of [ [ HKBU ] ] , has said that introducing standard working hours could avoid excessively long working hours of employees .
He also said that nowadays Hong Kong attains almost full employment , has a high rental price and severe inflation , recently implemented minimum wage , and is affected by a gloomy global economy ; he also mentioned that comprehensive considerations on macroeconomic situations are needed , and emphasized that it is perhaps inappropriate to adopt working - time regulation as exemplified in other countries to Hong Kong .
Lee Shu - Kam , Associate Professor of the Department of Economics and Finance of [ [ HKSYU ] ] , believes that standard working hours can not deliver " work - life balance " .
He referenced the research to the US by the University of California , Los Angeles in 1999 and pointed out that in the industries and regions in which the wage elasticity is low , the effects of standard working hours on lowering actual working time and increasing wages is limited : for regions where the labor supply is inadequate , standard working hours can protect employees ' benefits yet cause unemployment ; but for regions ( such as Japan ) where the problem does not exist , standard working hours would only lead to unemployment .
In addition , he said the effect of standard working hours is similar to that of ( for example ) giving overtime pay , making employees to favor overtime work more .
In this sense , introducing standard working hours does not match its principle : to shorten work time and to increase the recreation time of employees .
He believed that the key point is to help employees to achieve work - life balance and to get a win - win situation of employers and employees .
Francis Lui , Head and Professor of the Department of Economics of [ [ Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ] ] , believed that standard working hours may not lower work time but increase unemployment .
He used Japan as an example to illustrate that the implementation of standard working hours lowered productivity per head and demotivated the economy .
He also said that even if the standard working hours can shorten employees ' weekly working hours , they may need to work for more years to earn sufficient amount of money for [ [ retirement ] ] , i.e. delay their retirement age .
The total working time over the course of a lifetime may not change .
Lok - sang Ho , Professor of Economics and Director of the Centre for Public Policy Studies of [ [ Lingnan University ( Hong Kong)Lingnan University ] ] , pointed out that " as different employees perform various jobs and under different degrees of pressures , it may not appropriate to establish standard working hours in Hong Kong " ; and he proposed a 50-hour maximum work week to protect workers ' health .
SINGAPORE
Section::::Singapore .
[ [ Singapore ] ]
enacts an 8-hour normal work day ( 9 hours including lunchtime ) , a 44-hour normal working week , and a maximum 48-hour work week .
It is to note that if the employee works no more than five days a week , the employee 's normal working day is 9-hour and the working week is 44 hours .
Also , if the number of hours worked of the worker is less than 44 hours every alternate week , the 44-hour weekly limit may be exceeded in the other week .
Yet , this is subjected to the pre - specification in the service contract and the maximum should not exceed 48 hours per week or 88 hours in any consecutive two week time .
In addition , a shift worker can work up to 12 hours a day , provided that the average working hours per week do not exceed 44 over a consecutive 3-week time .
The overtime allowance per overtime hour must not be less than 1.5 times of the employee 's hour basic rates .
