SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION
The Smithsonian Institution ( ) , established on August 10 , 1846 " for the increase and diffusion of knowledge , " is a group of museums and research centers administered by the Government of the United States .
The institution is named after its founding donor , British scientist James Smithson .
Originally organized as the " United States National Museum , " that name ceased to exist as an administrative entity in 1967 .
Termed "
the nation 's attic " for its eclectic holdings of 154 million items , the Institution 's nineteen museums , nine research centers , and zoo include historical and architectural landmarks , mostly located in the District of Columbia .
Additional facilities are located in Arizona , Maryland , Massachusetts , New York City , Pittsburgh , Texas , Virginia , and Panama .
More than 200 institutions and museums in 45 states , Puerto Rico , and Panama are Smithsonian Affiliates .
The Institution 's thirty million annual visitors are admitted without charge .
Its annual budget is around $ 1.2 billion with two - thirds coming from annual federal appropriations .
Other funding comes from the Institution 's endowment , private and corporate contributions , membership dues , and earned retail , concession , and licensing revenue .
Institution publications include Smithsonian and Air & Space magazines .
FOUNDING
Section::::Founding .
The British scientist James Smithson ( 1765â€“1829 ) left most of his wealth to his nephew Henry James Hungerford .
When Hungerford died childless in 1835 , the estate passed " to the United States of America , to found at Washington , under the name of the Smithsonian Institution , an Establishment for the increase & diffusion of knowledge among men " , in accordance with Smithson 's will .
Congress officially accepted the legacy bequeathed to the nation , and pledged the faith of the United States to the charitable trust on July 1 , 1836 .
The American diplomat Richard Rush was dispatched to England by President Andrew Jackson to collect the bequest .
Rush returned in August 1838 with 105 sacks containing 104,960 gold sovereigns ( about $ 500,000 at the time , which is ) .
Once the money was in hand , eight years of Congressional haggling ensued over how to interpret Smithson 's rather vague mandate " for the increase and diffusion of knowledge .
"
Unfortunately , the money was invested by the US Treasury in bonds issued by the state of Arkansas which soon defaulted .
After heated debate , Massachusetts Representative ( and ex - President )
John Quincy Adams persuaded Congress to restore the lost funds with interest and , despite designs on the money for other purposes , convinced his colleagues to preserve it for an institution of science and learning .
Finally , on August 10 , 1846 , President James K. Polk signed the legislation that established the Smithsonian Institution as a trust instrumentality of the United States , to be administered by a Board of Regents and a Secretary of the Smithsonian .
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Development .
Though the Smithsonian 's first Secretary , Joseph Henry , wanted the Institution to be a center for scientific research , it also became the depository for various Washington and U.S. government collections .
The United States Exploring Expedition by the U.S. Navy circumnavigated the globe between 1838 and 1842 .
The voyage amassed thousands of animal specimens , an herbarium of 50,000 plant specimens , and diverse shells and minerals , tropical birds , jars of seawater , and ethnographic artifacts from the South Pacific Ocean .
These specimens and artifacts became part of the Smithsonian collections , as did those collected by several military and civilian surveys of the American West , including the Mexican Boundary Survey and Pacific Railroad Surveys , which assembled many Native American artifacts and natural history specimens .
In 1846 , the regents developed a plan for weather observation ; in 1847 , money was appropriated for meteorological research .
The Institution became a magnet for young scientists from 1857 to 1866 , who formed a group called the Megatherium Club .
The Smithsonian played a critical role as the U.S. partner institution in early bilateral scientific exchanges with the Academy of Sciences of Cuba .
MUSEUMS AND BUILDINGS Section::::Museums and buildings .
The Smithsonian Institution Building ( " the Castle " ) began construction in 1849 .
Designed by architect James Renwick Jr. , its interiors were completed by general contractor Gilbert Cameron .
The building opened in 1855 .
The Smithsonian 's first expansion came with construction of the Arts and Industries Building in 1881 .
Congress had promised to build a new structure for the museum if the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition generated enough income .
It did , and the building was designed by architects Adolf Cluss and Paul Schulze , based on original plans developed by Major General Montgomery C. Meigs of the United States Army Corps of Engineers .
It opened in 1881 .
The National Zoological Park opened in 1889 to accommodate the Smithsonian 's Department of Living Animals .
The park was designed by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted .

This structure was designed by the D.C. architectural firm of Hornblower & Marshall .
When Detroit philanthropist Charles Lang Freer donated his private collection to the Smithsonian and funds to build the museum to hold it ( which was named the Freer Gallery ) , it was among the Smithsonian 's first major donations from a private individual .
The gallery opened in 1923 .
More than 40 years would pass before the next museum , the Museum of History and Technology ( renamed the National Museum of American History in 1980 ) , opened in 1964 .
It was designed by the world - renowned firm of McKim , Mead & White .
The Anacostia Community Museum , an " experimental store - front " museum created at the initiative of Smithsonian Secretary S. Dillon Ripley , opened in the Anacostia neighborhood of Washington , D.C. , in 1967 .

The first new museum building to open since the National Museum of Natural History was the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden , which opened in 1974 .
The National Air and Space Museum , the Smithsonian 's largest in terms of floor space , opened in June 1976 .
Eleven years later , the National Museum of African Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery opened in a new , joint , underground museum between the Freer Gallery and the Smithsonian Castle .
Reuse of another old building came in 1993 with the opening of the National Postal Museum in the 1904 former City Post Office building , a few city blocks from the Mall .
In 2004 , the Smithsonian opened the National Museum of the American Indian in a new building near the United States Capitol .
Twelve years later almost to the day , in 2016 , the latest museum opened : the National Museum of African American History and Culture , in a new building near the Washington Monument .
CAPITAL CAMPAIGNS
Section::::Capital campaigns .
In 2011 , the Smithsonian undertook its first - ever capital fundraising campaign .
The $ 1.5 billion effort raised $ 1 billion at the three - year mark .
Smithsonian officials made the campaign public in October 2014 in an effort to raise the remaining $ 500 million .
More than 60,000 individuals and organizations donated money to the campaign by the time it went public .
This included 192 gifts of at least $ 1 million .
Members of the boards of directors of various Smithsonian museums donated $ 372 million .
The Smithsonian said that funds raised will go toward completion of the National Museum of African American History and Culture building , and renovations of the National Air and Space Museum , National Museum of American History , and the Renwick Gallery .
A smaller amount of funds will go to educational initiatives and digitization of collections .
As of September 2017 , the Smithsonian claimed to have raised $ 1.79 billion , with 3 months left in the formal campaign calendar .
Separately from the major capital campaign , the Smithsonian has begun fundraising through Kickstarter .
An example is a campaign to fund the preservation and maintenance of the ruby slippers from the 1939 film
The Wizard of Oz .

SMITHSONIAN LATINO CENTER Section::::Smithsonian Latino Center .
In 1997 , the Smithsonian Latino Center was created as a way to recognize Latinos across the Smithsonian Institution .
The primary purpose of the center is to place Latino contributions to the arts , history , science , and national culture across the Smithsonian 's museums and research centers .
The center is a division of the Smithsonian Institution .
As of May 2016 , the center is run by an executive director , Eduardo DÃ­az .
HISTORY Section::::History .
At the time of its creation , the Smithsonian Institution had other entities dedicated to other minority groups : National Museum of the American Indian , Freer - Sackler Gallery for Asian Arts and Culture , African Art Museum , and the National Museum of African - American Heritage and Culture .
The opening of the center was prompted , in part , by the publishing of a report called " Willful Neglect : The Smithsonian and U.S. Latinos " .
According to documents obtained by The Washington Post , when former Latino Center executive director Pilar O'Leary first took the job , the center faced employees who had " serious performance issues " .
No performance plans existed for the staff and unfulfilled financial obligations to sponsors existed .
The website 's quality was poor , and the center did not have a public affairs manager , a programs director , adequate human resources support , or cohesive mission statement .
After difficult times in the first few years , the center improved .
According to the Smithsonian , the center " support[s ] scholarly research , exhibitions , public and educational programs , web - based content and virtual platforms , and collections and archives .
[ It ] also manage[s ] leadership and professional development programs for Latino youth , emerging scholars and museum professionals . " Today , the website features a high - tech virtual museum .
YOUNG AMBASSADORS PROGRAM Section::::Young Ambassadors Program .
The Smithsonian Latino Center 's Young Ambassadors Program ( YAP ) is a program within the Latino Center that reaches out to Latino high school students with the goal of encouraging them to become leaders in arts , sciences , and the humanities .
Students selected for the program travel to Washington , D.C. for an " enrichment seminar " that lasts approximately five days .
Afterwards , students return to their communities to serve in a paid , one - month internship .
Pilar O'Leary launched the program when she served as executive director of the Smithsonian Latino Center .
According to the Latino Center , O'Leary told the press in 2007 : " Our goal is to help our Young Ambassadors become the next generation of leaders in the arts and culture fields .
This program encourages students to be proud of their roots and learn more about their cultural heritage to inspire them to educate the public in their own communities about how Latinos are enriching America 's cultural fabric . "

ADMINISTRATION Section::::Administration .
The Smithsonian Institution was established as a trust instrumentality by act of Congress .
More than two - thirds of the Smithsonian 's workforce of some 6,300 persons are employees of the federal government .
The Smithsonian Office of Protection Services oversees security at the Smithsonian facilities and enforces laws and regulations for National Capital Parks together with the United States Park Police .
The President 's 2011 budget proposed just under $ 800 million in support for the Smithsonian , slightly increased from previous years .
Institution exhibits are free of charge , though in 2010 the Deficit Commission recommended admission fees .
As approved by Congress on August 10 , 1846 , the legislation that created the Smithsonian Institution called for the creation of a Board of Regents to govern and administer the organization .
This 17-member board meets at least four times a year and includes as ex officio members the Chief Justice of the United States and the Vice President of the United States .
The nominal head of the Institution is the Chancellor , an office which has traditionally been held by the Chief Justice .
In September 2007 , the board created the position of Chair of the Board of Regents , a position currently held by John W. McCarter of Illinois .
Other members of the Board of Regents are three members of the U.S. House of Representatives appointed by the Speaker of the House ; three members of the Senate , appointed by the President pro tempore of the Senate ; and nine citizen members , nominated by the board and approved by the Congress in a joint resolution signed by the President of the United States .
Regents who are senators or representatives serve for the duration of their elected terms , while citizen Regents serve a maximum of two six - year terms .
Regents are compensated on a part - time basis .
The chief executive officer ( CEO ) of the Smithsonian is the Secretary , who is appointed by the Board of Regents .
The Secretary also serves as secretary to the Board of Regents , but is not a voting member of that body .
The Secretary of the Smithsonian has the privilege of the floor at the United States Senate .
There have been 12 Secretaries .
On September 18 , 2013 , Secretary G. Wayne Clough announced he would retire in October 2014 .
The Smithsonian Board of Regents said it has asked regent John McCarter , Jr. to lead a search committee .
The search committee will consist of other regents and representatives from Smithsonian museums and centers .

ENOLA GAY DISPLAY Section::::Controversies .
Section::::Enola Gay display .
In 1995 , controversy arose over the exhibit at the National Air and Space Museum with the display of the Enola Gay , the Superfortress used by the United States to drop the first atomic bomb used in World War II .
The American Legion and Air Force Association believed the exhibit put forward only one side of the debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , and that it emphasized the effect on victims without discussing its use within the overall context of the war .
The Smithsonian changed the exhibit , displaying the aircraft only with associated technical data and without discussion of its historic role in the war .
CENSORSHIP OF " SEASONS OF LIFE AND LAND " Section::::Censorship of " Seasons of Life and Land " .
In 2003 , a National Museum of Natural History exhibit , Subhankar Banerjee 's Seasons of Life and Land , featuring photographs of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , was censored and moved to the basement by Smithsonian officials because they feared that its subject matter was too politically controversial .
In November 2007 , The Washington Post reported internal criticism has been raised regarding the institution 's handling of the exhibit on the Arctic .
According to documents and e - mails , the exhibit and its associated presentation were edited at high levels to add " scientific uncertainty " regarding the nature and impact of global warming on the Arctic .
Acting Secretary of the Smithsonian CristiÃ¡n Samper was interviewed by the Post , and claimed the exhibit was edited because it contained conclusions that went beyond what could be proven by contemporary climatology .
The Smithsonian is now a participant in the U.S. Global Change Research Program .
COPYRIGHT RESTRICTIONS
Section::::Copyright restrictions .
The Smithsonian Institution provides access to its image collections for educational , scholarly , and nonprofit uses .
Commercial uses are generally restricted unless permission is obtained .
Smithsonian images fall into different copyright categories ; some are protected by copyright , many are subject to license agreements or other contractual conditions , and some fall into the public domain , such as those prepared by Smithsonian employees as part of their official duties .
The Smithsonian 's terms of use for its digital content , including images , are set forth on the Smithsonian Web site .
In April 2006 , the institution entered into an agreement of " first refusal " rights for its vast silent and public domain film archives with Showtime Networks , mainly for use on the Smithsonian Channel , a network created from this deal .
Critics contend this agreement effectively gives Showtime control over the film archives , as it requires filmmakers to obtain permission from the network to use extensive amounts of film footage from the Smithsonian archives .
The Smithsonian contends independent producers continue to have unchanged access to the institution and its collections as they had prior to the agreement .
The process to gain access to film at the Smithsonian remains the same .
Since January 2006 , independent producers have made more than 500 requests to film in the museums and collections or to use archival footage and photos .
