LIST OF SURVIVING LOCKHEED P-38 LIGHTNINGS
The Lockheed P-38 Lighting is an American two - engine fighter used by the United States Army Air Forces and other Allied air forces during World War II .
Of the 10,037 planes built , 26 survive today , 22 of which are located in the United States , and 10 of which are airworthy .
BACKGROUND Section::::Background .
In late 1945 when the last P-38 came off the production line , 9,923 aircraft had been delivered to the USAAF .
The P-38 was quickly declared obsolete in 1946 and the last USAF flight was in 1948 .
This was an extremely complicated aircraft to maintain .
The P-38 Lightning has been consistently on the civil registry since 1946 since the first aircraft were released from the military .
It does remain a demanding aircraft with numerous crash incidents ; several of the surviving planes have been rebuilt many times .
A considerable number of late model Lightnings which had been converted by Lockheed to Photo Reconnaissance ( F-5 ) models found a niche with photo mapping companies and until the middle 1960s these aircraft earned their keep through photo mapping assignments around the globe .
Additionally , the latest military use of the P-38 was with several South American air forces , the largest of these being which operated the Lockheed Lightning until the early 1960s .
There were also a small number of P-38s that were purchased after the war for civilian air racing .
It is from these sources that until the early 1980s all the remaining stocks of the P-38 Lightning could be drawn from .
One historic note was that in 1948 , representatives of the then - new country of South Korea attempted to purchase the brand new P-38L Lightnings stored in the Philippines ( approximately 100 aircraft ) .
Instead , the USAF persuaded them to accept AT-6s modified to ground attack role as well as worn out P-51D Mustangs ; the brand new P-38s were destroyed .
As with all remaining warbirds , collectors began scouring the world for forgotten aircraft .
From the jungle of New Guinea , the wildness of Alaska and under the ice of Greenland are but some of the places previously - unrestorable wrecked airframes are being recovered and being restored for both static display and airworthy exhibition .
INDIVIDUAL HISTORIES
* Glacier Girl ( 41 - 7630 ) , this P-38F-1 flown by 1st
Lt .
Harry L. Smith , Jr. , 94th Fighter Squadron , was one of six P-38 fighters of the 1st Fighter Group escorting two B-17 bombers on a ferry flight to the United Kingdom as part of Operation Bolero on 15 July 1942 .
While en route over Greenland , bad weather caused the eight aircraft to turn back , the entire flight attempting to land together before they ran out of fuel .
Although one P-38 overturned , the flight successfully belly - landed .
The crews were rescued within a few days , but the airplanes were abandoned and , over the years , covered by ice .
A few attempts to salvage the airplanes were made but were unsuccessful .
Eventually , Roy Shoffner — a businessman from Middlesboro , Kentucky — acquired the salvage rights and in 1992 , 50 years after the planes landed , a P-38 recovery mission was undertaken .
Using photos taken by the original crews while they were awaiting rescue as well as modern seismographic equipment , the salvage workers located the buried squadron and selected the least damaged of the planes .
They reached it by boring a hole using hot water through the layer of ice 268 feet thick .
The airplane was transported to Middlesboro , where a ten - year restoration began using many parts from late model aircraft .
Nicknamed Glacier Girl , the restored P-38F Lightning made its first post - restoration flight on 26 October 2002 .
* Maid of Harlech ( 41 - 7677 )
P-38F-1LO ex-49th Squadron , 14th Fighter Group , 8th Air Force , in the summer of 2007
this aircraft was discovered on a beach in Wales , having been buried in the sand for 65 years .
A wingtip had come off the aircraft during its belly landing , but the pilot — Second Lt .
Robert F. ' Fred ' Elliot — escaped unhurt .
Elliot was on a gunnery practice mission when a fuel supply error forced him to make an emergency landing .
American airmen salvaged the nose guns but were unable to fly the fighter off the beach , abandoning it in place where it became covered by naturally shifting sand .
Elliot was shot down less than three months later while flying combat missions over Tunisia .
His body and aircraft were never found .
