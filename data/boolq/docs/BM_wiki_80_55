3,000 HIT CLUB
In Major League Baseball ( MLB ) , the 3,000 hit club is the group of batters who have collected 3,000 or more regular - season hits in their careers .
Cap Anson was the first to join the club on July 18 , 1897 , although his precise career hit total is unclear .
Two players — Nap Lajoie and Honus Wagner — reached 3,000 hits during the 1914 season .
Ty Cobb became the club 's fourth member in 1921 and became the first player in MLB history to reach 4,000 hits in 1927 ; he ultimately finished his career with 4,191 .
Pete Rose became the second member of the 4,000 hit club on April 13 , 1984 while playing for the Montreal Expos .
Cobb , also the major leagues ' all - time career batting average leader , remained the MLB hit leader until September 11 , 1985 , when Rose collected his 4,192nd hit .
Rose , the current record holder , finished his career with 4,256 hits .
Roberto Clemente 's career ended with precisely 3,000 hits , reaching the mark in the last at bat of his career on September 30 , 1972 .
In total , 32 players have reached the 3,000 hit mark in MLB history .
Of these , 17 were right - handed batters , 13 were left - handed , and two were switch hitters , meaning they could bat from either side of the plate .
Ten of these players have played for only one major league team .
Six players — Hank Aaron , Willie Mays , Eddie Murray , Rafael Palmeiro , Albert Pujols and Alex Rodriguez — are also members of the 500 home run club .
At .367 , Cobb holds the highest career batting average among club members , while Cal Ripken Jr. holds the lowest at .276 .
Rodriguez , Derek Jeter , and Wade Boggs are the only players to hit a home run for their 3,000th hit and Paul Molitor and Ichiro Suzuki are the only players to hit a triple for their 3,000th ; all others hit a single or double .
Craig Biggio was thrown out at second base attempting to stretch his 3,000th hit , a single , into a double .
Biggio and Jeter are the only players to join the club in a game where they had five hits ; Jeter reached base safely in all of his at bats .
The most recent player to join the club is Pujols , who collected his 3,000th hit on May 4 , 2018 , while playing for the Los Angeles Angels .
Baseball writer Josh Pahigian writes that membership in the club has been " long considered the greatest measure of superior bat handling . "
Reaching 3,000 hits is often described as a guarantee of eventual entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame .
All eligible club members , with the exception of Palmeiro , whose career has been tainted by steroid allegations , have been elected to the Hall , and since 1962 all club members who have been inducted were elected on the first ballot , except for Biggio .
Rose is ineligible for the Hall of Fame because he was permanently banned from baseball in 1989 .
After four years on the ballot , Palmeiro failed to be named on 5 % of ballots in 2014 , and accordingly his name was removed from the Baseball Writers ' Association of America ballot for future elections , although it is possible that the Veterans Committee could in the future enshrine him .
Twenty - one different teams have had a player reach 3,000 hits .
