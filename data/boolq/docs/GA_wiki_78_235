CRUSHED RED PEPPER Crushed red pepper or red pepper flakes
is a condiment consisting of dried and crushed ( as opposed to ground ) red chili peppers .
This condiment is most often produced from cayenne - type peppers , although commercial producers may use a variety of different cultivars , usually within the 30,000–50,000 Scoville unit range .
The town of Bukovo in the Republic of Macedonia is credited with the creation of crushed red pepper .
The name of the village — or a derivative of it — is now used as a name for crushed red pepper in general in a number of Southeast European languages : " буковка " ( bukovka , Macedonian ) , " bukovka " ( Serbian , Croatian and Slovene ) and " μπούκοβο " ( búkovo , Greek ) .
Crushed red pepper shakers have become a standard on tables at Mediterranean restaurants and especially pizza parlors around the world .
Often there is a high ratio of seeds , which are popularly believed to contain the most spice .
Crushed red pepper is used by food manufacturers in pickling blends , chowders , spaghetti sauce , pizza sauce , soups and sausage .
Crushed red pepper in Turkey , served as a common condiment with very few seeds , is known as pul biber in English .
One specially prepared variety of it is the Urfa pul biber ( isot ) .
