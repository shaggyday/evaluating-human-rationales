MARTIN LUTHER KING JR .
DAY
Martin Luther King Jr. Day ( officially Birthday of Martin Luther King , Jr. and sometimes referred to as MLK Day ) is an American federal holiday marking the birthday of
Martin Luther King Jr. It is observed on the third Monday of January each year , which is around King 's birthday , January 15 .
The holiday is similar to holidays set under the Uniform Monday Holiday Act .
The earliest Monday for this holiday is January 15 and the latest is January 21 .
King was the chief spokesperson for nonviolent activism in the Civil Rights Movement , which successfully protested racial discrimination in federal and state law .
The campaign for a federal holiday in King 's honor began soon after his assassination in 1968 .
President Ronald Reagan signed the holiday into law in 1983 , and it was first observed three years later .
At first , some states resisted observing the holiday as such , giving it alternative names or combining it with other holidays .
It was officially observed in all 50 states for the first time in 2000 .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The idea of
Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a holiday was promoted by labor unions in contract negotiations .
After King 's death , U.S. Representative John Conyers ( a Democrat from Michigan ) and U.S. Senator Edward Brooke ( a Republican from Massachusetts ) introduced a bill in Congress to make King 's birthday a national holiday .
The bill first came to a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1979 .
However , it fell five votes short of the number needed for passage .
Two of the main arguments mentioned by opponents were that a paid holiday for federal employees would be too expensive , and that a holiday to honor a private citizen would be contrary to longstanding tradition ( King had never held public office ) .
Only two other figures have national holidays in the U.S. honoring them : George Washington and Christopher Columbus .
Soon after , the King Center turned to support from the corporate community and the general public .
The success of this strategy was cemented when musician Stevie Wonder released the single " Happy Birthday " to popularize the campaign in 1980 and hosted the Rally for Peace Press Conference in 1981 .
Six million signatures were collected for a petition to Congress to pass the law , termed by a 2006 article in The Nation as " the largest petition in favor of an issue in U.S. history . "
Senators Jesse Helms and John Porter East ( both North Carolina Republicans ) led opposition to the holiday and questioned whether King was important enough to receive such an honor .
Helms criticized King 's opposition to the Vietnam War and accused him of espousing " action - oriented Marxism " .
Helms led a filibuster against the bill and on October 3 , 1983 , submitted a 300-page document to the Senate alleging that King had associations with communists .
New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan declared the document a " packet of filth " , threw it on the Senate floor and stomped on it .
President Ronald Reagan originally opposed the holiday , citing cost concerns .
When asked to comment on Helms ' accusations that King was a communist , the president said " We 'll know in thirty - five years , wo n't we ? " , in reference to the eventual release of FBI surveillance tapes that had previously been sealed .
But on November 2 , 1983 , Reagan signed a bill , proposed by Representative Katie Hall of Indiana , to create a federal holiday honoring King .
The bill had passed the House of Representatives by a count of 338 to 90 , a veto - proof margin .
The holiday was observed for the first time on January 20 , 1986 .
The bill also established the
Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday Commission to oversee observance of the holiday , and Coretta Scott King , King 's wife , was made a member of this commission for life by President George H. W. Bush in May 1989 .
STATE - LEVEL PASSAGE Section::::State - level passage .
Although the federal holiday honoring King was signed into law in 1983 and took effect three years later , not every U.S. state chose to observe the holiday at the state level until 1991 , when the New Hampshire legislature created " Civil Rights Day " and abolished " Fast Day " .
In 2000 , Utah became the last state to have a holiday named after King when " Human Rights Day " was officially changed to " Martin Luther King Jr. Day . "
In 1986 , Arizona Governor Bruce Babbitt , a Democrat , created a paid state MLK holiday in Arizona by executive order just before he left office , but in 1987 , his Republican successor Evan Mecham , citing an attorney general 's opinion that Babbitt 's order was illegal , reversed Babbitt 's decision days after taking office .
Later that year , Mecham proclaimed the third Sunday in January to be " Martin Luther King Jr./Civil Rights Day " in Arizona , albeit as an unpaid holiday .
In 1990 , Arizona voters were given the opportunity to vote on giving state employees a paid MLK holiday .
That same year , the National Football League threatened to move Super Bowl XXVII , which was planned for Arizona in 1993 , if the MLK holiday was voted down .
In the November election , the voters were offered two King Day options : Proposition 301 , which replaced Columbus Day on the list of paid state holidays , and Proposition 302 , which merged Lincoln 's and Washington 's birthdays into one paid holiday to make room for MLK Day .
Both measures failed to pass , with only 49 % of voters approving Prop 302 , the more popular of the two options ; although some who voted " no " on 302 voted " yes " on Prop 301 .
Consequently , the state lost the chance to host Super Bowl XXVII , which was subsequently held at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena , California .
In a 1992 referendum , the voters , this time given only one option for a paid King Day , approved state - level recognition of the holiday .
On May 2 , 2000 , South Carolina governor Jim Hodges signed a bill to make King 's birthday an official state holiday .
South Carolina was the last state to recognize the day as a paid holiday for all state employees .
Prior to this , employees could choose between celebrating
Martin Luther King Jr. Day or one of three Confederate holidays .
ALTERNATIVE NAMES Section::::Alternative names .
While all states now observe the holiday , some did not name the day after King .
For example , in New Hampshire , the holiday was known as " Civil Rights Day " until 1999 , when the State Legislature voted to change the name of the holiday to Martin Luther King Day .
Several additional states have chosen to combine commemorations of King 's birthday with other observances :
*
In Alabama : " Robert E. Lee / Martin Luther King Birthday " .
*
In Arizona : " Martin Luther King Jr./Civil Rights Day " .
*
In Idaho : " Martin Luther King Jr.–Idaho Human Rights Day " .
*
In Mississippi : " Martin Luther King 's and Robert E. Lee 's Birthdays " .
*
In New Hampshire : " Martin Luther King Jr. Civil Rights Day " .
*
In Virginia : it was known as Lee – Jackson – King Day , combining King 's birthday with the established Lee – Jackson Day .
In 2000 , Lee – Jackson Day was moved to the Friday before
Martin Luther King Jr. Day , establishing
Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a holiday in its own right .
*
In Arkansas : it was known as " Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. 's Birthday and Robert E. Lee 's Birthday " from 1985 to 2017 .
Legislation in March 2017 changed the name of the state holiday to " Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. 's Birthday " and moved the commemoration of Lee to October .
WORKPLACE OBSERVANCE
Section::::Workplace observance .
Overall , in 2007 , 33 % of employers gave employees the day off , a 2 % increase over the previous year .
There was little difference in observance by large and small employers : 33 % for firms with over 1,000 employees ; and , 32 % for firms with under 1,000 employees .
The observance is most popular among nonprofit organizations and least popular among factories and manufacturers .
The reasons for this have varied , ranging from the recent addition of the holiday , to its occurrence just two weeks after the week between Christmas and New Year 's Day , when many businesses are closed for part or sometimes all of the week .
Additionally , many schools and places of higher education are closed for classes ; others remain open but may hold seminars or celebrations of King 's message .
The observance of MLK Day has led to some colleges and universities extending their Christmas break to include the day as part of break .
Some factories and manufacturers used MLK Day as a floating or movable holiday .
KING DAY OF SERVICE
Section::::King Day of Service .
The national Martin Luther King Day of Service was started by former Pennsylvania U.S. Senator Harris Wofford and Atlanta Congressman John Lewis , who co - authored the King Holiday and Service Act .
The federal legislation challenges Americans to transform the King Holiday into a day of citizen action volunteer service in honor of King .
The federal legislation was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on August 23 , 1994 .
Since 1996 , Wofford 's former state office director , Todd Bernstein , has been directing the annual Greater Philadelphia King Day of Service , the largest event in the nation honoring King .
Several other universities and organizations around the U.S. , such as Arizona State University , Greater DC Cares and City Year , participate in the Martin Luther King Jr. Day of Service .
In honor of MLK , hundreds of Volunteer Centers , and volunteers across the country donate their time to make a difference on this day .
The only other official national day of service in the U.S. , as designated by the government , is September 11 National Day of Service ( 9/11 Day ) .
OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES Section::::Outside the United States .
One place outside the U.S. where Martin Luther King Jr. Day is observed in the Japanese city of Hiroshima under mayor Tadatoshi Akiba , who holds a special banquet at the mayor 's office as an act of unifying his city 's call for peace with King 's message of human rights .
The City of Toronto , in Ontario , Canada , is another city that has officially recognized
Martin Luther King Jr. Day , although not as a paid holiday : all government services and businesses remain open .
In 1984 , during a visit by the U.S. Sixth Fleet , Navy chaplain Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff conducted the first Israeli presidential ceremony in commemoration of Martin Luther King Jr. Day , held in the President 's Residence , Jerusalem .
Aura Herzog , wife of Israel 's then - President Chaim Herzog , noted that she was especially proud to host this special event , because Israel had a national forest in honor of King , and that Israel and King shared the idea of " dreams " .
Resnicoff continued this theme in his remarks during the ceremony , quoting the verse from Genesis , spoken by the brothers of Joseph when they saw their brother approach , " Behold the dreamer comes ; let us slay him and throw him into the pit , and see what becomes of his dreams . "
Resnicoff noted that , from time immemorial , there have been those who thought they could kill the dream by slaying the dreamer , but – as the example of King 's life shows – such people are always wrong .
Every year , since 1986 , the Dr. Martin Luther King Tribute and Dinner is held in Wassenaar , The Netherlands .
The Tribute includes young people and veterans of the Civil Rights Movement as well as music .
it always ends with everyone holding hands in a circle and singing " We Shall Overcome .
" The Tribute is held on the last Sunday in January and bridges Dr. King 's birthday and Black History Month .
