WHITE RICE White rice is milled rice that has had its husk , bran , and germ removed .
This alters the flavor , texture and appearance of the rice and helps prevent spoilage and extend its storage life .
After milling , the rice is polished , resulting in a seed with a bright , white , shiny appearance .
The milling and polishing processes both remove nutrients .
A diet based on unenriched white rice leaves many people vulnerable to the neurological disease beriberi , due to a deficiency of thiamine ( vitamin B ) .
White rice is often enriched with some of the nutrients stripped from it during its processing .
Enrichment of white rice with B , B , and iron is required by law in the United States .
As with all natural foods , the precise nutritional composition of rice varies slightly depending on the variety , soil conditions , environmental conditions and types of fertilizers .
Adopted over brown rice in the second half of the 19th century because it was favored by traders , white rice has led to a beriberi epidemic in Asia .
At various times , starting in the 19th century , brown rice and wild rice have been advocated as more healthful alternatives .
The bran in brown rice contains significant dietary fiber and the germ contains many vitamins and minerals .
Typically , 100 grams of uncooked rice produces around 240 to 260 grams of cooked grains , the difference in weight being due to absorbed cooking water .
