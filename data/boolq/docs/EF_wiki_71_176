PROFESSIONAL DEGREE
A professional degree , formerly known in the US as a first professional degree , is a degree that prepares someone to work in a particular profession , often meeting the academic requirements for licensure or accreditation .
Professional degrees may be either graduate or undergraduate entry , depending on the profession concerned and the country , and may be classified as bachelor 's , master 's or doctoral degrees .
For a variety of reasons , professional degrees may bear the name of a different level of qualification from their classification in qualifications frameworks , e.g. some UK professional degrees are named bachelor 's but are at master 's level , while some Australian and Canadian professional degrees have the name " doctor " but are classified as master 's or bachelor 's degrees .

Section::::History of professional degrees in Europe .
The first doctorates were awarded in the mid twelfth century to recognise teachers ( doctors ) in mediaeval universities , either in civil law at the University of Bologna or in theology at the University of Paris .
These were followed shortly afterwards by doctorates in canon law , and then in the thirteenth century by doctorates in medicine , grammar , logic and philosophy .
These mediaeval doctorates remained , however , essentially teaching qualifications , with their major importance being the ius ubique docendi – the right to teach anywhere .
HISTORY OF PROFESSIONAL DEGREES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM Section::::History of professional degrees in the United Kingdom .
The first university medical school to be established in the United Kingdom was at the University of Edinburgh in 1726 , followed in 1744 by the University of Glasgow .
In 1817 Glasgow became the first British university to offer a separate degree in surgery , the Master of Surgery .
However , other Scottish universities – St Andrews and the two universities in Aberdeen – also offered medical degrees , often in absentia and without examination , despite not having medical schools .
In England , the two universities ( Oxford and Cambridge ) were only sporadically interested in medical teaching , which was mainly carried out in the London hospitals .
It was not until the establishment of the University of London in 1836 , however , that students at the hospital medical schools could earn degrees .
Following the passing of the Medical Act 1858 and the establishment of the General Medical Council , Scottish graduates gained the right to practice in England and degrees in both medicine and surgery became the norm .
The Scottish practice of awarding the Doctor of Medicine ( MD ) as a first degree was abolished by the university commissioners appointed under the Universities ( Scotland ) Act 1858 , it being replaced by the Bachelor of Medicine and Master of Surgery ( MS ) , with the MD becoming a higher degree as in England .
The commissioners under the Universities ( Scotland ) Act 1889 completed the reform by replacing the MS with the Bachelor of Surgery , the MS joining the MD as a higher degree and the initial professional qualification taking on its modern form as the double Bachelor of Medicine , Bachelor of Surgery degree .
The first university in England to offer training in theology for those intending to become priests in the Church of England was the University of Durham in 1833 , following the lead of colleges such as St Bees Theological College and St David 's College , Lampeter .
The Licence in Theology could be taken as either a one year graduate course , following on from a BA , or a three year undergraduate course .
Shortly after , in 1837 , Durham also became the first British university to teach engineering ( although the course closed after a few years ) , followed only a few months later by King 's College London .
Anglican theological colleges partnered with local universities to offer professional degrees in theology and ministry during the twentieth century .
Since 2014 , however , the Common Award degrees , validated by Durham , have offered a more unified training across the theological colleges .
Some colleges continue to offer other degrees in addition to the Common Awards , such as the Cambridge Bachelor of Theology at the Cambridge Theological Federation Legal studies in England were mainly confined to the Inns of Court until the late nineteenth century .
The only undergraduate course was at Cambridge and concentrated on Roman civil law rather than English common law ; in terms of employment that the bishops accepted it as equivalent to a BA for ordination was more useful than the legal training it provided , and it was generally seen as an easy option for those who could n't cope with the mathematics on the BA course .
Cambridge reformed its course in 1858 , and London established an undergraduate course a few years later .
However , it has only been since the 1960s that law schools have taken on a leading role in training lawyers and truly established professional degrees .
In the latter part of the twentieth century , many chartered bodies introduced educational requirements for their chartered professional statuses , most notably the Engineering Council requirements for Chartered Engineer .
This led to the accreditation of degrees by the relevant professional bodies and , in the case of engineering , to the Washington Accord – an international agreement between engineering regulatory bodies to recognise professional degrees accredited in each country – signed originally in 1989 by the UK , US , Australia , Canada , Ireland and New Zealand , and since expanded to include many other countries .
In the twenty - first century , the standard professional degree for many science and engineering fields was raised from bachelor 's to master 's level , including for qualification as a Chartered Physicist ( from 2001 ) , Chartered Scientist ( from 2004 ) and Chartered Engineer ( from 2012 ) .
HISTORY OF PROFESSIONAL DEGREES IN NORTH AMERICA Section::::History of professional degrees in North America .
The M.B. or Bachelor of Medicine was the first medical degree to be granted in the United States and Canada .
The first medical schools that granted the M.B. degree were at the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University .
Columbia University was the first American university to grant the M.D. degree in 1770 , although , as in England , this followed the M.B. ( which was the qualifying degree ) and required completion of a thesis .
Professional societies started licensing doctors from the 1760s , and in the early nineteenth century started setting up their own medical schools , known as proprietary medical colleges , the first being the medical college of the Medical Society of the County of New York , which opened March 12 , 1807 .
These eliminated the general education and long lecture terms of the university schools , making them much more popular .
Without effective regulation , abuses arose , and national conventions in 1846 and 1847 led to the establishment of the American Medical Association .
This new body set the first nationwide standards for M.D. degrees , requiring that students had a liberal education in arts and sciences as part of their degree , that they had served an apprenticeship before starting the course , and that the course lasted three years .
The M.D. was thus the first entry - level professional degree to be awarded as a purely trade school ' doctor'-degree in the United States , before the first European - style doctorate , the Ph.D. , was awarded by an American Institution in 1861 , although the M.D. was not established as a post - baccalaureate degree until much later .
The President of Yale , Arthur Twining Hadley , stated in the early 20th century that : " However convenient it might be to insist on the possession of a bachelor 's degree by all pupils in the schools of law or medicine , I feel that it would be a violation of our duty to these professions to hedge ourselves about by any such artificial limitations .
" This changed ( for medicine ) after Abraham Flexner 's damning report into the state of medical education in 1910 : by 1930 almost all medical schools required a previous liberal arts degree before starting the M.D. course .
Law degrees were introduced in the US by the College of William & Mary in 1792 , with its " Batchellor of Law " ( sic ) ( L.B. ) degree .
This was followed by the " Graduate of Law " at the University of Virginia in 1829 , which became the first American LL.B. in 1840 .
The J.D. was introduced by the University of Chicago in 1902 , with the same curriculum as the LL.B. but requiring a previous B.A. or B.S. for entry .
The J.D. spread , but encountered opposition , and Harvard , which imposed graduate entry as a requirement for its LL.B. course in 1909 , and Yale used the name for their post - LL.B. degree , elsewhere called the LL.M. By the 1930s , when most law schools had shifted to graduate entry , the standard degree was once again the LL.B.
The second shift to the J.D. , again without a change of curriculum , came in the 1960s , with all American Bar Association - accredited professional degrees adopting the nomenclature by 1971 .
In the late twentieth and early twenty - first century , other professions , particularly in clinical fields , transitioned their professional degrees to doctorates , following the example of the M.D. and J.D.
In the 1990s there was also some debate in the architectural community about renaming the professional degree in architecture a " doctorate " .
The spread of professional doctorates raised concerns about the standards of the new degrees , particularly in cases such as Physical Therapy , where the standard set by the American Physical Therapy Association for the doctorate is the same as that for the master 's degree .
Critics have claimed that these degrees should not be called doctorates , pointing out that a Ph.D. takes an average of twelve years from the start of college , compared to five and a half to eight years for professional doctorates , while defenders of the new professional doctorates have said the point of comparison should be the M.D. and J.D. , not the Ph.D. PROFESSIONAL DEGREES BY COUNTRY UNITED STATES Section::::Professional degrees by country .
Section::::United States .
Among the professional degrees in the United States , one particular form was the graduate - entry first - professional degree , often denominated as a doctorate .
The U.S. Department of Education defines these as : " A first - professional degree was an award that required completion of a program that met all of the following criteria : ( 1 ) completion of the academic requirements to begin practice in the profession ; ( 2 ) at least 2 years of college work prior to entering the program ; and ( 3 ) a total of at least 6 academic years of college work to complete the degree program , including prior required college work plus the length of the professional program itself .
"
The use of the term " first - professional " was discontinued by the Department of Education as of 2010 - 11 , when new post - baccalaureate award categories were introduced .
Prior to this , first - professional degrees were awarded in the following fields : * Chiropractic ( D.C. ) * Dentistry ( D.D.S. , D.M.D. ) * Law ( LL.B. , J.D. ) * Medicine ( M.B. , M.D. ) * Optometry ( O.D. ) * Osteopathic Medicine ( D.O. ) * Pharmacy ( Pharm . D. )
* Podiatry ( D.P.M. ) * Theology ( M.Div , S.T.B. , B.D. ) * Veterinary Medicine ( D.V.M. , V.M.D. ) Since 2011 , the classification " doctor 's degree - professional practice " has been used for " [ a ] doctor 's degree that is conferred upon completion of a program providing the knowledge and skills for the recognition , credential , or license required for professional practice . "
As with the " first professional degree " , this classification also requires that the total time in higher education is at least six years , although the requirement for at least two years of college - level study prior to entering the program was removed .
The Department of Education does not define which fields professional doctorates may be awarded in , unlike with the " first professional degree " .
Besides professional doctorates , other professional degrees can exist that use the title of bachelor or master , e.g. B.Arch .
and M.Arch .
in architecture .
In particular , first professional degrees in theology , which did not use the title of doctor , were reclassified as master 's degrees in 2011 - including the B.D. A distinction is drawn in the US between professional doctorates and " doctor 's degree - research / scholarship " , with the latter being " [ a ] Ph.D. or other doctor 's degree that requires advanced work beyond the master 's level , including the preparation and defense of a dissertation based on original research , or the planning and execution of an original project demonstrating substantial artistic or scholarly achievement .
" Internationally , US professional doctorates ( which , unlike research doctorates , are not defined as requiring work beyond the master 's level ) are not generally considered to be doctoral level qualifications .
The classification of " Doctor 's degree - other " also exists for doctorates that do not meet the definition of either professional doctorates or research doctorates .
Some professional fields offer degrees beyond the professional doctorate or other degree required for qualification , sometimes termed post - professional degrees .
Higher professional degrees may also be offered in fields that do not have specific academic requirements for entry , such as Fine Arts .
These degrees may be at master 's or doctorate levels .
PROFESSIONAL DEGREES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM Section::::Professional degrees in the United Kingdom .
Professional degrees in the UK are accredited by professional , statutory and regulatory bodies , which work with the Quality Assurance Agency on defining benchmark statements for their subjects .
Specific benchmark statements have also been produced for professional qualifications in Scotland .
Many professional degrees span teaching at bachelor 's and master 's level , leading to a master 's level award .
This includes older degrees that retain the names of bachelor 's degrees for historic reasons , e.g. the Bachelor of Medicine , Bachelor of Surgery ( MBBS , MBChB , etc . ) , Bachelor of Dental Surgery ( BDS ) and Bachelor of Veterinary Science ( BVS ) , and newer integrated master 's degrees such as the Master of Engineering ( MEng ) or Master of Pharmacy ( MPharm ) .
In some subjects , qualification can be via separate bachelor 's and master 's degrees , e.g. a Bachelor of Engineering ( BEng ) followed by a Master of Science ( MSc ) in Engineering , or a Bachelor of Arts ( BA ) or Bachelor of Science ( BSc ) in Architecture followed by a year of professional experience , then a two - year Master of Architecture ( MArch ) .
In some subjects the normal professional degree is a bachelor 's degree , e.g. the Bachelor of Laws ( LLB ) or BA in Law ( for both solicitors and barristers ) or a BSc in Surveying .
Some professional bodies also offer different levels of professional recognition , e.g. a master 's degree is needed for Chartered Engineers or Chartered Scientists but a bachelor 's degree for Incorporated Engineers and a bachelor 's or foundation degree for Registered Scientists .
It is common for professional qualification in the UK to require professional experience in addition to academic qualification .
For Architecture , the standard route has a year of experience between the bachelor 's and master 's stages and a further year after the master 's before the final examination ; becoming a Chartered Engineer requires post - degree Initial Professional Development that typically takes four to six years ; becoming a General Practitioner requires five years of study beyond the MBBS , while qualifying as a Consultant takes seven to nine more years .
In addition to initial professional degrees , some professional master 's degrees and most professional doctorates , e.g. the Master of Business Administration ( MBA ) , Doctor of Education ( EdD ) and Doctor of Engineering ( EngD ) , are offered for those already established in professions .
UK professional doctorates are research degrees at the same level as PhDs , normally including teaching at doctoral level but still assessed by a doctoral research thesis or equivalent .
Some professional degrees are designed specifically for trainees or members within a particular organisation , rather than being available via general enrolment .
Examples of these include the Church of England 's Common Awards with Durham University and the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants ' BSc in Applied Accounting with Oxford Brookes University .
INTERNATIONAL EQUIVALENCE
IN MEDICINE Section::::International equivalence .
Section::::In medicine .
In medicine , individual countries specify rules for recognising foreign qualifications ; in the US , for example , this is carried out by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates ( ECFMG ) and in the UK by the General Medical Council ( GMC ) .
The Australian Medical Council , US ECFMG , UK GMC , Medical Council of Canada , Danish Health and Medicines Authority and Korean Institute of Medical Education and Evaluation jointly sponsor the World Directory of Medical Schools .
At least one state in the US , Wisconsin , permits foreign graduates to use the title " MD " if licensed to practice in the US .
IN
ENGINEERING Section::::In engineering .
In engineering , the Washington Accord ( 1989 ) recognised that the academic training ( i.e. professional degrees ) for full professional status ( Professional Engineer , Chartered Engineer , European Engineer etc . ) is equivalent in the signatory countries .
Similarly the Sydney Accord ( 2001 ) recognises similar academic training between signatories for Engineering Technologists , Incorporated Engineers , etc .
and the Dublin Accord ( 2002 ) for Engineering Technicians .
For computing and information technology , the Seoul Accord ( 2008 ) recognises similar academic training on accredited courses for computing and information technology professionals in the signatory countries .
