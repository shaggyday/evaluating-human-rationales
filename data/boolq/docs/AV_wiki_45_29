VINCE LOMBARDI TROPHY
The Vince Lombardi Trophy is the trophy awarded each year to the winning team of the National Football League 's championship game , the Super Bowl .
The trophy is named in honor of NFL coach Vince Lombardi , who led the Green Bay Packers to victories in the first two Super Bowl games .
HISTORY Section::::History .
During lunch with NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle in 1966 , Tiffany & Co. vice president Oscar Riedner made a sketch on a cocktail napkin of what would become the Vince Lombardi Trophy .
The original trophy was produced by Tiffany & Co. in Newark , New Jersey .
Others have since been handcrafted by the company in Parsippany , New Jersey .
As of 2017 , the trophy is produced at the Tiffany & Co Forrest Hills manufacturing facility in Cumberland , Rhode Island .
The trophy was first awarded to the Green Bay Packers in January 15 , 1967 , following the 1966 regular season ( when the Super Bowl 's official designation was the AFL - NFL World Championship Game ) after they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs , 35 - 10 .
Even though it is a national tournament , the award was initially inscribed with the words " World Professional Football Championship " .
It was officially renamed in 1970 in memory of NFL head coach Vince Lombardi , who led the Packers to victories in the first two Super Bowl games , after his death from cancer .
It was thus presented for the first time as the Vince Lombardi Trophy in Super Bowl V when the Baltimore Colts defeated the Dallas Cowboys 16 - 13 .
It has also been referred to as the " Tiffany Trophy " after the Tiffany & Co.
Since Super Bowl XXX , the award has been presented to the winning team 's owner on the field following the game .
Previously , it was presented inside the winning team 's locker room .
In the case of the community - owned Packers ' two titles since Super Bowl XXX , the team 's President & CEO has accepted the trophy .
Unlike trophies such as the Stanley Cup and the Grey Cup , a new Vince Lombardi Trophy is made every year and the winning team maintains permanent possession of that trophy , with one notable exception being Super Bowl V 's , won by the then - Baltimore Colts .
The city of Baltimore retained that trophy as part of the legal settlement between the team and the city after the Colts ' infamous " Midnight Mayflower " move to Indianapolis on March 29 , 1984 .
Since then , both the relocated Colts and their replacement in Baltimore , the Ravens , have won the Super Bowl and earned trophies in their own right .
Since Super Bowl XLV , the Vince Lombardi Trophy is also prominently featured in the standardized logo design now used for all future Super Bowl games .
APPEARANCE Section::::Appearance .
The Vince Lombardi Trophy stands tall , weighs and depicts a football in a kicking position on a three concave sided stand , and is entirely made of sterling silver .
The words " Vince Lombardi Trophy " along with the Roman numerals of that year 's Super Bowl are engraved on and the NFL shield is affixed onto the base .
After the trophy is awarded , it is sent back to Tiffany 's to be engraved with the names of the participating teams , the date , location , and the game 's final score .
It is then sent back to the winning team for them to keep .
Smaller replicas are made for each person on the winning team .
For the first four championship games , both the NFL and the AFL logos were in the center of the trophy .
Starting from Super Bowl V , only the NFL shield was on the front .
Beginning with Super Bowl XXXVIII , the shield took on a frosted appearance .
Starting with Super Bowl XLIII , the slightly redesigned NFL shield began appearing on the trophy , still with a frosted appearance .
Other than the logo , the trophy has had no significant changes made since the first Super Bowl .
While no franchise possesses all four versions , the Green Bay Packers , New England Patriots , New York Giants , and Pittsburgh Steelers have three of the four designs .
