POP - RAP Pop - rap or hip - pop is a genre of music fusing the rhythm - based lyricism of hip hop music with pop music 's preference for melodious vocals and catchy tunes , which gained mainstream popularity during the 1990s .
The lyrics are often lighthearted , with choruses similar to those heard in pop music .
The influences and roots of pop rap trace back to late 1980s
hip hop artists , such as Run DMC , LL Cool J , and Beastie Boys .
CHARACTERISTICS Section::::Characteristics .
Allmusic describes pop - rap as " a marriage of hip - hop beats and raps with strong melodic hooks , which are usually featured as part of the chorus section in a standard pop - song structure " .
Pop rap also tends to have less aggressive lyrics than street - level rap music .
However , some artists from the 1990s fused pop - rap with a more aggressive attitude to defuse backlash on their own accessibility .
Music journalist Wilson McBee strongly criticized pop - rap music and rejected it as hip hop music and described it by saying " A pop rapper is assumed to be a sellout – someone who has compromised artistic principles in order to fit commercial expectations .
Or worse , it 's someone who never had any artistic principles to begin with , who 's guilty of bastardizing rap 's social and political traditions just to make money .
"
McBee also then went on saying "
In labeling the likes of Flo Rida and others pop rappers , we blur the distinction between a " pop rapper " and a rapper who is just really popular .
Not every rapper who has a hit is automatically a sellout or deserving of the pop rap tag . "
While some rappers from the 1990s with catchy hooks have been compared to pop music , McBee also said Pop - rap lyrics often have lyrical content similar to that in pop music with themes such as love and relationships .

Later , rap artists such as Tone Loc , Young MC , and Fresh Prince then made songs with lots of party tunes and storytelling abilities as they became very popular .
During the 1990s , pop rap began to expand even more as hip hop music also began to connect strongly with dance music and
R&B. In the early 1990s , MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice broke into the mainstream with songs like " U Ca n't Touch This " and " Ice Ice Baby " , respectively .

By the end of the 1990s and early 2000s rappers such as Ja Rule fused gangsta rap themes with 1980s pop and soul elements , pop - rap was dominated by many artists .
