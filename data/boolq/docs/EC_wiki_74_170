Head of ABC TV Drama , Miranda Dear , on announcing season two of the hit drama : Season Two of Bed of Roses is the story of a woman 's search – and a community 's search – for a workable identity in the 21st Century .
It is also a love story .
Because whether you 're 80 , 50 or 17 , none of us is immune to that totally infuriating , confusing , heating , frighteningly vulnerable sensation that renders us smiling , crying , despairing , and hopeful , all in the same breath .
Particularly when you 're not sure which man you 're in love with .
