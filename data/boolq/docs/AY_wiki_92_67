In 2017 , it was the second most visited theme park in the UK after Legoland Windsor .
The park features a range of major attractions , such as Congo River Rapids , Runaway Mine Train , Nemesis , Oblivion , Galactica , The Smiler , and Wicker Man .

HISTORY Section::::History .
Alton Towers first began to be open to the public on a regular basis following the opening of Alton railway station .
Money raised from railway excursions was paid to the Earl and helped to maintain the upkeep of the grounds .
In 1924 , a group of local businessmen formed Alton Towers Ltd and began to restore the gardens as a tourist attraction .
In the 1950s , this included the operation of a fairground , and by the 1970s included a boating lake and chairlift .
After millionaire property developer John Broome married the daughter of majority shareholder Denis Bagshaw in 1973 , he bought out the controlling stake in Alton Towers .
Over the next few years , he laid the foundation for the modern theme park by installing various permanent rides and developing areas of the grounds in progressive stages .
In the 1980s , Broome opened a succession of rides and roller coasters around the park , including Corkscrew , Pirate Ship ( now The Blade ) , Alpine Bobsleigh , The Flume , and The Black Hole .
Broome sold Alton Towers to The Tussauds Group , then a division of Pearson plc , in 1990 , after encountering financial troubles in attempting to develop the former Battersea Power Station into a similar theme park .
The change of ownership brought an era of major redevelopment and promotion , involving the opening of large themed areas and new attractions , such as Runaway Mine Train ( 1992 ) , The Haunted House ( 1992 ) , Toyland Tours ( 1994 ) , and Nemesis ( 1994 ) .
Later , Oblivion ( 1998 ) and Air ( 2002 , now Galactica ) saw the park sustain its reputation for major roller coasters , both marketed as ' World First ' rides .
Tussauds ' park development team from 1990 to 2002 included well - known attraction producer John Wardley , among experienced others .
The Tussauds Group was sold to venture capitalist firm Charterhouse in 1998 , then to Dubai International Capital ( DIC ) for £ 800 million in 2005 .
The Tussauds Group was then bought by Merlin Entertainments in March 2007 for over £ 1billion from DIC , placing Alton Towers under their control .
In May 2007 , The Blackstone Group purchased The Tussauds Group for US$ 1.9 billion and merged it into Merlin Entertainments with management by Merlin .
Dubai International Capital also gained 20 % of Merlin Entertainment .
On 17 July 2007 , Alton Towers was sold to private investor Nick Leslau 's investment firm Prestbury under a sale and leaseback agreement .
Merlin continues to operate the site under a renewable 35-year lease .

FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS Section::::Future developments .
In July 2009 , the Alton Towers Resort outlined a 10-year development plan for the park ( 2010–2019 ) , the aim being to increase visitor numbers , in particular multi - day guests .
The plan showed an option for a third hotel or new accommodation of some sort over the coming years .
This was later revealed to be a log cabin development , The Enchanted Village .
The plan also highlighted areas for development , as well as suggesting the possibility of a new park entrance nearer to the hotels , which could act as a second entrance or replacement to the existing one in Towers Street .
Plans for a Phase 2 of the Enchanted Village were approved in July 2018 .
Plans for a Phase 2 on the same site had already been granted in April 2016 however these proposals were scrapped in favour of a camping option .
The new accommodation will be branded as Stargazing Pods and is due to be completed in Spring 2019 .
On 12 October , Alton Towers website confirmed that The Alton Towers Dungeon will open in 2019 .
It will follow a similar format to The London Dungeon , which is also part of the Merlin group .
TOWERS LOVING CARE Section::::Towers Loving Care .
In 2016 , Alton Towers began promoting its park maintenance online , under the banner " Towers Loving Care " .
The features typically include scenic paintwork , relaying pathways , changing light bulbs and changes to park audio .
The 2015 - 2016 winter season included paintwork for Nemesis , painting over the original scenic rust effect from the track supports , but restoring colour and detail to the station exterior .
Signs and some scenery were also added to the Dark Forest area , around a scaffold tunnel under Rita .
In 2016 , Hex re - opened with extensive repairs to its lighting and effects under the " TLC " name ; also with a new sound system , although the quality of the new sound system was contested by visitors .
The TLC page announced that it would be carrying out similar repairs to Duel the following season .
The project is co - ordinated in - house by Alton Towers Resort as a means of securing budget for essential aesthetic maintenance , to circumvent the lack of dedicated budget delivered by parent company Merlin Entertainments .
The resort launched a Twitter and Facebook account which frequently showcases images of what occurrences are taking place under the project .
SECRET WEAPON ROLLER COASTERS Section::::Secret Weapon roller coasters .
Alton Towers has a tradition of codenaming its new roller coaster developments as " Secret Weapon " , or " SW " , followed by a number .
The name is associated with the park 's inclination to promote its rides as holding " world first " or in some way " innovative " features and records .
However the naming tradition actually began for unrelated reasons , since " Secret Weapon " was the working title of a roller coaster that was ultimately never commissioned .
SW1 was a pipeline roller coaster , planned to open in around 1992 , on what later became the Nemesis site .
It was provisionally titled the " Secret Weapon " , with the intention of theming the ride as an ambiguous weapon testing facility .
John Wardley rode the Arrow Dynamics prototype of their pipeline coaster , but stated " it was very slow and rather boring " , as well as the requirement for such a high lift hill being unsuitable for the park 's planning restrictions .
After a second layout revision , labelled " SW2 " , the ride was scrapped and development on SW3 ( Nemesis ) began .
The code name subsequently became the standard preliminary name for major roller coaster projects at the park .
The convention was briefly dropped while the park ( and its parent company the Tussauds Group ) was owned by Dubai International Capital , before being continued by the Merlin Group .
The " Secret Weapon " rides are : !

" The Welcoming :
Be Chosen " -
This scare maze was originally created in 2017 to promote the Wicker Man ( roller coaster ) and has returned for 2018 .
It is based on a group called The Beornen and just in the woods of a fictional town called Altonbay lies a ritual taking place to celebrate their interpretation of Halloween by building and setting alight to a Wicker Man structure .
For the first time ever they have allowed ' Outsiders ' to join in this celebration .
But little do you know that they have something up their sleeve .
A sacrifice .
* Project 42 - New for 2018 PAST SEASONAL SCAREFEST ATTRACTIONS
* Terror of the Towers .
The first incarnation of this long - running annual scare maze was introduced in 2002 , and was located in the Towers ruins themselves .
Many scenes from the original maze are still used .
Visitors walked through the long , winding corridors of the Towers , through themed scenes while being pursued by live actors .
The finale featured a winding pathway around actors behind fences , who lunged towards visitors , accompanied with heavy strobe effects .
For 2003 it was restructured and given the tagline and theme " Bloodfest Banquet " .
* " TH13TEEN : After Dark " has an enhanced queue line for Alton Towers ' newest roller coaster , using fog and lighting effects as well as live actors .
This attraction did not return for 2012 .
* Terror of the Towers –
Bloodfest Banquet was a new version of the Terror of the Towers scare maze , running from 2003 to 2008 .
It retained much of the original version , but featured new scenes that included scripted dialogue from the several characters , and a new storyline was added .
The strobe maze finale was moved to another point in the maze and replaced by a new ending , in which visitors become trapped in a small room with cages on every side , as actors reach for them through the metal bars for almost a minute .
Every year , Terror of the Towers kept changing slightly with revised scenes and new scares .
However , for the 2009 Scarefest event , Terror of the Towers was once again completely rethought , with the tagline " What Lies Within " .
The new incarnation drops the scripted scenes and characters ; meaning it is similar to the original Terror of Towers of 2002 .
The whole layout for the maze was also reversed , with what was previously the entrance becoming the exit .
* Room 13 was first introduced in 2006 and was located in the conference room of the Alton Towers Hotel .
It was only available to guests of the hotel , who were led around the maze as many live actors appeared to scare them .
Room 13 had positive reviews and returned in 2007 , but was replaced by The Boiler House in 2008 .
* Field of 1000 Screams was first introduced in the 2007 Scarefest event and was the first maze at Alton Towers not situated inside a pre - existing building .
The Field was located entirely outdoors in a moderately sized field of maize , which had to be planted especially for the event several months earlier .
It purported to be a fictional village called Altonville that had become overrun by zombies .
Visitors walked down a long pathway cut through the corn , and encountered characters and scares along the way , before the finale took place .
The Field of 1000 Screams did not return for the 2010 event .
* Haunted Hollow Live was first seen in 2007 and consisted of several sinister , costumed actors performing along the Haunted Hollow walkway in Gloomy Wood .
The attraction was similar to Duel Live , which was introduced the year later .
Haunted Hollow Live returned for the 2008 Scarefest event , but was cancelled for 2009 .
*
Duel Live was first introduced in the 2008 Scarefest event .
Throughout this period , the park 's haunted house dark ride , Duel , became host to this attraction , which included live actors situated around the ride circuit .
Duel was available to ride normally until 12 pm , when the laser guns and LED targets were switched and the actors took their positions .
This was changed in 2009 , when Duel Live took place throughout the whole day and many more actors than the previous year were present .
Duel Live was aimed at the family audience , and included such features as new music playing throughout the ride ( instead of the usual Duel theme music ) , as well as a butler or maid who would welcome you inside the house .
The attraction was changed slightly for the 2010 season and featured the park 's Scarefest mascots .
* Skelvin 's Haunted Adventure was a newer version of , introduced in 2010 , and took over Duel
– The Haunted House Strikes Back !
throughout Scarefest .
As in previous years , the attraction included live actors situated at different points around the ride .
The laser guns and LED targets were switched off during this time .
The ride featured the Scarefest mascots , notably the character of " Skelvin " .
*
The Boiler House was a scare maze first introduced in 2008 , and was situated next to the Alton Towers Hotel .
Originally , the scare maze was set in an abandoned industrial facility and featured live actors in make up .
This was changed in 2009 , when a new storyline was added .
The scare maze later featured the fictional " Hamble Twins " serial killers hiding in the industrial building , and visitors have to escape them as they are chased through the scenes .
Visitors queued outside , past a van labelled " Alton News 24 " , from which television screens play news reports on the activity of the serial killers .
Guests then walk through a covered walkway , which hides the marquee that the maze is contained in from view .
Once inside , a man appears and warns guests about the dangers of coming inside .
The murderers then appear and kill him , before chasing visitors away .
Each of the Twins are played by two different actors wearing the same grotesque , latex mask .
They appear at different points in the maze , creating the illusion that one character is in several places at once .
Dim lighting and scent effects are heavily used .
For the 2011 Scarefest , The Boiler House moved along with the Carnival of Screams to the X Sector , where they both shared the old Black Hole tent .
After three years it did not return for the 2012 season .
* Carnival of Screams was a scare maze that debuted for the 2010 Scarefest event .
During its debut it shared the same temporary building as the Boiler House .
John Wardley contributed to the development of Carnival of Screams , which was entered through a large clown face with horrific features .
For 2011 it and the Boiler House were relocated to the X - Sector area .
The maze is a mixture of humor and serious scares , and the music used is the former Toy Land Tours attraction theme music warped for dramatic effect .
From 2012 onwards , the attraction was situated opposite the hospitality suite , with the exit inside the Goal Striker unit .
In 2013 and its final incarnation , the maze gained a theatrical ending involving a knife thrower .
*
The Sanctuary was new for the 2012 Scarefest event and returned in 2013 and 2014 .
The attraction was set in a research facility operated by " The Ministry of Joy " .
Alton Towers released the following description at the time : "
Lost your Smile ?
Then check yourself in for a refreshing check up at The Sanctuary .
After being closed for new patients for almost 50 years The Sanctuary , The Ministry of Joy 's earliest establishment , is now holding important trials searching for ' Advocates ' for its 2013 project .
" It was revealed to be part of marketing for The Smiler roller coaster , which opened in 2013 .
* Scary Tales Scare Zone was a walk through scare zone that ran for the 2014 event .
The attraction setting revolved around fairy tale stories that were rewritten in a nightmarish manner .
* The Haunting of Molly Crowe , a multi - sensory maze set in the Towers ruins .
The maze was based on the old and abandoned house of Molly Crowe , who was last seen engulfed in flames in the cellar of her house , emitting a scream of non human origin .
This ran for the 2015 event .
* Nox :
Infernus Scare Zone , a scare zone which ran for the 2015 event , set in the Dark Forest .
The underworld rises again - Will you join the Cult or face the end of the world as we know it ?
* Dark Apocalypse Scare Zone , a scare zone which was first introduced for the 2015 event and returning in 2016 .
A deadly virus has spread across Forbidden Valley .
The infected show signs of highly aggressive behavior and rapid physical decomposition .
Phalanx control has quarantined the area however , a recent security breach has questioned their ability to contain the virus and keep society safe .
* Terror of the Towers –
What Lies Within , the signature maze situated inside the Towers themselves , first introduced in 2002 .
A new format was introduced in the 2009 Scarefest event , along with the new tagline " What Lies Within " replacing " Bloodfest Banquet " .
Visitors queue outside in Her Ladyship 's Gardens , and the attraction itself starts in the derelict Conservatories .
Batches of guests watch a short video showing two men exploring the Towers for ghosts .
The video then cuts short , and guests enter the Towers to find the men .
At certain points in the maze , the bodies of the two men are each seen hanging from a noose .
Visitors become lost in the lengthy corridors and themed scenes in the Towers , with live actors pursuing them in every room .
The finale to the attraction is a maze - like walkway that winds around actors in cages , with strobe effects .
FIREWORKS Section::::Fireworks .
For the last days of the season , Alton Towers host firework Shows , these have been running annually since the 1990s on the Great Lawns .
The displays were considered disruptive by some local residents , which led to formal complaints .
Two local residents decided to take the theme park to court regarding this issue .
The court issued Alton Towers with a noise abatement order in October 2005 which restricted the theme park to three shows a year , previously five , with noise readings not exceeding 40 decibels outside the park .
In 2006 , the display was rebranded as Electric Towers , but then discontinued .
However , the fireworks and laser show was reinstated in 2010 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the theme park and has returned to being an annual event .
OTHER EVENTS
Section::::Other events .
During the closed season months Alton Towers holds regular Pirate & Princess Weekends .
The event entails decorations , and themed activities for children in the Hotels and the waterpark .
The theme park 's Sharkbait Reef aquarium also opens for the event .
During December , the Santa 's Sleepover event takes place .
Both resort hotels are decorated for the event and a pantomime takes place .
The Alton Towers Theme Park also opens for Christmas with a small number of rides open as well as a Santa 's Grotto .
The event is largely aimed at children .
In 2015 , the theme park permitted entry to non - hotel guests for the first time however the event has reverted to hotel guests only in 2016 .
Since 2015 Alton Towers have opened the park for a Services Day ; a day where a limited quantity of discounted tickets ( fewer than on a usual season day ) are sold to those who work in public services such as the Police , NHS , Fire brigade , Prison service , Army , RAF , Royal Navy and other similar services .
Services Day is usually held approximately two weeks prior to the start of the new season , which usually begins mid - March .
Due to the success of the 2015 , ' 16 and ' 17 Services Days , a two - day weekend of Services Days was planned for 3 and 4 March , however this was postponed to 11 March due to weather conditions .
Services Days are open to holders of a Blue Light Card or a Defence Discount Service Card .
INCIDENTS THE SMILER Section::::Incidents .
Section::::The Smiler .
In June 2015 , sixteen people were injured on The Smiler ride , with two individuals requiring leg amputations .
Merlin Entertainments originally released a press release blaming the crash on " human error " .
However , the Health & Safety Executive ( HSE ) concluded the crash was foreseeable , stating that " Merlin failed to put in place systems that allowed their engineers to work safely on the ride while it was running " .
During the subsequent court case , Merlin retracted their statement and pleaded guilty to a breach of health and safety law .
The company was fined £ 5Million , with the court citing a " catalogue of errors " with Merlin 's operating procedure and training .
In June 2017 , Alton Towers estate owner Nick Leslau incorrectly repeated that the crash was due to " a human error " , but added that " Merlin has paid a massive price , but the performance of the business has been exemplary and the share price is now at an all - time high . "
SKY RIDE Section::::Sky Ride .
On 30 June 2004 , due to a strong gust of wind , the Sky Ride cables became caught , jamming the ride .
About 80 people were on the ride , and nine people had to be rescued by being abseiled down cables .
During the 2007 Scarefest season , a fire broke out in the Forbidden Valley section of the park due to a halogen lamp that damaged the roof and mechanics of the ride .
The damage was reparable and had to be closed for six months before reopening midway through the 2008 season .
Nobody was harmed .
Another fire happened to the ride this time in the Cloud Cuckoo Land station in the 2009 season , due to a faulty vending machine , on the 21st of July 2009 .
The fire completely destroyed the whole station .
Over the following season , the station was rebuilt , ready for the 2010 season .
RUNAWAY MINE
TRAIN Section::::Runaway Mine Train .
On 20 July 2006 , when the train was entering the tunnel section of its course , two carriages uncoupled , the carriages comprising the front half continuing up the slope while the rear half of the train remained stuck in the tunnel .
The front half failed to make it over the hill , rolled back and crashed into the rear half which had remained stuck in the tunnel .
Six people were taken to hospital and 23 others were treated for cuts and bruises .
Following the incident the Runaway Mine Train was closed for the rest of the season .
The train was only returned to full length operation in June the following year .
CONSERVATION AREA RESTRICTIONS Section::::Conservation Area restrictions .
Alton Towers is set in a Conservation Area , which puts a restriction on the height of any ride or building development in the park .
It has been agreed with the local council that no buildings should be built above the tree line and if so should be disguised to fit the landscape ; this can be seen on the ride Rita , where parts of the top of the track is camouflaged green as to fit in with the trees .
Noise pollution is also a problem for the park due to the close proximity to the villages of Alton and Farley and the town of Cheadle .
There have been several cases where Alton Towers have been taken to court over the noise levels emitted from the park and have been served noise abatement orders in 2004 , 2005 and 2006 .
COURT CASES Section::::Court cases .
On 3 May 2012 a couple from the local village of Farley won the rights to a full High Court trial on the amount of noise generated by the park .
The couple have been in a legal battle with the park for nearly a decade , and during this period succeeded in a noise abatement order on the theme park which led to the audio from the top of the Oblivion drop being removed , and Alton Towers having to limit the amount of annual fireworks displays to only three a year .
Stephen and Suzanne Roper , who live only 100 yards from the park , say that their lives have been made a misery by the noise of the screams as well as fireworks displays and music .
They launched their legal fight in 2002 , but after years of wrangling , their claim for an injunction and damages was thrown out in January 2011 .
Judge Mr Justice Hickinbottom later overturned that decision , bringing the claim back .
This now paves the way for a full court hearing .
The Ropers will seek an injunction forcing the park owners to close or relocate some rides and an order forcing them to pay damages for noise suffered from 1998 to the present .
