BOEING
B-29 SUPERFORTRESS
The Boeing B-29 Superfortress is a four - engine propeller - driven heavy bomber designed by Boeing , which was flown primarily by the United States during World War II and the Korean War .
It was one of the largest aircraft operational during World War II and featured state - of - the - art technology .
Including design and production , at over $ 3 billion it was the single most expensive weapons project in World War II , exceeding the $ 1.9 billion cost of the Manhattan Project — using the value of dollars in 1945 .
Innovations introduced included a pressurized cabin , dual - wheeled , tricycle landing gear , and an analog computer - controlled fire - control system directing four remote machine gun turrets that could be operated by a single gunner and a fire - control officer .
A manned tail gun installation was semi - remote .
The name " Superfortress " continued the pattern Boeing started with its well - known predecessor , the B-17 Flying Fortress .
Designed for the high - altitude strategic bomber role , the B-29 also excelled in low - altitude nighttime incendiary bombing missions .
One of the B-29 's final roles during World War II was carrying out the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
Because of the B-29 's advanced design , unlike many other World War II - era bombers , the Superfortress remained in service long after the war ended , with a few even being employed as flying television transmitters for the Stratovision company .
The B-29 served in various roles throughout the 1950s .
The Royal Air Force flew the B-29 as the Washington until phasing out the type in 1954 .
The Soviet Union produced an unlicensed reverse - engineered copy as the Tupolev Tu-4 .
The B-29 was the progenitor of a series of Boeing - built bombers , transports , tankers , reconnaissance aircraft and trainers including the B-50 Superfortress ( the first aircraft to fly around the world non - stop ) which was essentially a re - engined B-29 .
The type was retired in the early 1960s .
The B-29 production total was 3,970 aircraft .
Dozens of B-29s remain as static displays , but only two examples , Fifi and Doc , have been restored to flying status , with Doc flying again for the first time from McConnell AFB on July 17 , 2016 .
A transport developed from the B-29 was the Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter , first flown in 1944 , followed by its commercial airliner variant , the Boeing Model 377 Stratocruiser in 1947 .
This bomber - to - airliner derivation was similar to the B-17 / Model 307 evolution .
In 1948 Boeing introduced a tanker variant of the B-29 as the KB-29 , followed by the Model 377-derivative KC-97 introduced in 1950 .
A heavily modified line of outsized - cargo variants of the Stratocruiser is the GuppyMini GuppySuper Guppy , which remain in service today with operators including NASA .
DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT Section::::Design and development .
Boeing began work on pressurized long - range bombers in 1938 , in response to a United States Army Air Corps request .
Boeing 's design study for the Model 334 was a pressurized derivative of the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress with nosewheel undercarriage .
Although the Air Corps did not have money to pursue the design , Boeing continued development with its own funds as a private venture .
In April 1939 , Charles Lindbergh convinced general Henry H. Arnold to produce a new bomber in large numbers to counter the Nazi production .
The Air Corps issued a formal specification for a so - called " superbomber " , capable of delivering of bombs to a target away and capable of flying at a speed of in December 1939 .
Boeing 's previous private venture studies formed the starting point for its response to this specification .
Boeing submitted its Model 345 on 11 May 1940 , in competition with designs from Consolidated Aircraft ( the Model 33 , later to become the B-32 ) , Lockheed ( the Lockheed XB-30 ) , and Douglas ( the Douglas XB-31 ) .
Douglas and Lockheed soon abandoned work on their projects , but Boeing received an order for two flying prototypes , given the designation XB-29 , and an airframe for static testing on 24 August 1940 , with the order being revised to add a third flying aircraft on 14 December .
Consolidated continued to work on its Model 33 as it was seen by the Air Corps as a backup in case of problems with Boeing 's design .
Boeing received an initial production order for 14 service test aircraft and 250 production bombers in May 1941 , this being increased to 500 aircraft in January 1942 .
The B-29 featured a fuselage design with circular cross - section for strength .
The need for pressurization in the cockpit area also led to the B-29 being one of very few American combat aircraft of World War II to have a stepless cockpit design , without a separate windscreen for the pilots .
Manufacturing the B-29 was a complex task .
It involved four main - assembly factories : a pair of Boeing operated plants at Renton , Washington ( Boeing Renton ) , and Wichita , Kansas ( now Spirit AeroSystems ) , a Bell plant at Marietta , Georgia ( " Bell - Atlanta " ) , and a Martin plant at Omaha , Nebraska ( " Martin - Omaha " - Offutt Field ) .
Thousands of subcontractors were involved in the project .
The first prototype made its maiden flight from Boeing Field , Seattle on 21 September 1942 .
The combined effects of the aircraft 's highly advanced design , challenging requirements , and immense pressure for production , hurried development and caused setbacks .
The second prototype , which , unlike the unarmed first , was fitted with a Sperry defensive armament system using remote - controlled gun turrets sighted by periscopes , first flew on 30 December 1942 , this flight being terminated due to a serious engine fire .
On 18 February 1943 , the second prototype , flying out of Boeing Field in Seattle , experienced an engine fire and crashed .
The crash killed Boeing test pilot Edmund T. Allen and his 10-man crew , 20 workers at the Frye Meat Packing Plant and a Seattle firefighter .
Changes to the production craft came so often and so fast that in early 1944 , B-29s flew from the production lines directly to modification depots for extensive rebuilds to incorporate the latest changes .
AAF - contracted modification centers and its own air depot system struggled to handle the scope of the requirements .
Some facilities lacked hangars capable of housing the giant B-29 , requiring outdoor work in freezing cold weather , further delaying necessary modification .
By the end of 1943 , although almost 100 aircraft had been delivered , only 15 were airworthy .
This prompted an intervention by General Hap Arnold to resolve the problem , with production personnel being sent from the factories to the modification centers to speed availability of sufficient aircraft to equip the first Bomb Groups in what became known as the " Battle of Kansas " .
This resulted in 150 aircraft being modified in the five weeks between 10 March and 15 April 1944 .
The most common cause of maintenance headaches and catastrophic failures were the engines .
Although the Wright R-3350 Duplex - Cyclone radial engines later became a trustworthy workhorse in large piston - engined aircraft , early models were beset with dangerous reliability problems .
This problem was not fully cured until the aircraft was fitted with the more powerful Pratt & Whitney R-4360 " Wasp Major " in the B-29D / B-50 program , which arrived too late for World War II .
Interim measures included cuffs placed on propeller blades to divert a greater flow of cooling air into the intakes which had baffles installed to direct a stream of air onto the exhaust valves .
Oil flow to the valves was also increased , asbestos baffles installed around rubber push rod fittings to prevent oil loss , thorough pre - flight inspections made to detect unseated valves , and frequent replacement of the uppermost five cylinders ( every 25 hours of engine time ) and the entire engines ( every 75 hours ) .
Pilots , including the present day pilots of the Commemorative Air Force 's Fifi , one of the last two remaining flying B-29s , describe flight after takeoff as being an urgent struggle for airspeed ( generally , flight after takeoff should consist of striving for altitude ) .
Radial engines need airflow to keep them cool , and failure to get up to speed as soon as possible could result in an engine failure and risk of fire .
One useful technique was to check the magnetos while already on takeoff roll rather than during a conventional static engine - runup before takeoff .
In wartime , the B-29 was capable of flight at altitudes up to , at speeds of up to ( true airspeed ) .
This was its best defense , because Japanese fighters could barely reach that altitude , and few could catch the B-29 even if they did attain that altitude .
Only the heaviest of anti - aircraft weapons could reach it , and since the Axis forces did not have proximity fuzes , hitting or damaging the aircraft from the ground in combat proved difficult .
DEFENSIVE GUN TURRET
EMPLACEMENTS Section::::Defensive gun turret emplacements .
The General Electric Central Fire Control system on the B-29 directed four remotely controlled turrets armed with two .50 Browning M2 machine guns each .
All weapons were aimed optically with targeting computed by analog electrical instrumentation .
There were five interconnected sighting stations located in the nose and tail positions and three Plexiglas blisters in the central fuselage .
Five General Electric analog computers ( one dedicated to each sight ) increased the weapons ' accuracy by compensating for factors such as airspeed , lead , gravity , temperature and humidity .
The computers also allowed a single gunner to operate two or more turrets ( including tail guns ) simultaneously .
The gunner in the upper position acted as fire control officer , managing the distribution of turrets among the other gunners during combat .
The tail position initially had two .50 Browning machine guns and a single M2 20 mm cannon .
Later aircraft had the 20 mm cannon removed , and sometimes replaced by a third machine gun .
In early 1945 Major General Curtis Lemay , commander of XXI Bomber Command — the Marianas - based B-29-equipped bombing force — ordered most of the defensive armament and remote - controlled sighting equipment removed from the B-29s under his command .
The affected aircraft had the same reduced defensive firepower as the nuclear weapons - delivery intended Silverplate B-29 airframes , and could carry greater fuel and bomb loads as a result of the change .
The lighter defensive armament was made possible by a change in mission from high - altitude , daylight bombing with high explosive bombs to low - altitude night raids using incendiary bombs .
As a consequence of this requirement , Bell Atlanta ( BA ) produced a series of 311 B-29Bs that had turrets and sighting equipment omitted , except for the tail position , which was fitted with AN / APG-15 fire control radar .
This version could also have an improved APQ-7 " Eagle " bombing - through - overcast radar fitted in an airfoil shaped radome under the fuselage .
Most of these aircraft were assigned to the 315th Bomb Wing , Northwest Field , Guam .
PRESSURIZATION
Section::::Pressurization .
The crew enjoyed , for the first time in a bomber , full - pressurization comfort .
This first - ever cabin pressure system for an Allied production bomber was developed for the B-29 by Garrett AiResearch .
The nose and the cockpit were pressurized , but the designers were faced with deciding whether to have bomb bays that were not pressurized , between fore and aft pressurized sections , or a fully pressurized fuselage with the need to de - pressurize to drop their loads .
The solution was a long tunnel over the two bomb bays
so as not to interrupt pressurization during bombing .
Crews could crawl back and forth between the fore and aft sections , with both areas and the tunnel pressurized .
The bomb bays were not pressurized .
OPERATIONAL HISTORY
WORLD WAR II
Section::::Operational history .
Section::::World War II .
In September 1941 , the Army Air Forces plans for war against Germany and Japan proposed basing the B-29 in Egypt for operations against Germany as British airbases were likely to be overcrowded .
Air Force planning throughout 1942 and early 1943 continued to have the B-29 deployed initially against Germany , only transferring to the Pacific after the end of the war in Europe .
By the end of 1943 , however , plans had changed , partly due to production delays , and the B-29 was dedicated to the Pacific Theater .
A new plan implemented at the direction of President Franklin D. Roosevelt as a promise to China , called Operation Matterhorn , deployed the B-29 units to attack Japan from four forward bases in southern China , with five main bases in India , and to attack other targets in the region from China and India as needed .
The Chengdu region was eventually chosen over the Guilin region to avoid having to raise , equip , and train 50 Chinese divisions to protect the advanced bases from Japanese ground attack .
The XX Bomber Command , initially intended to be two combat wings of four groups each , was reduced to a single wing of four groups because of the lack of availability of aircraft , automatically limiting the effectiveness of any attacks from China .
This was an extremely costly scheme , as there was no overland connection available between India and China , and all supplies had to be flown over the Himalayas , either by transport aircraft or by the B-29s themselves , with some aircraft being stripped of armor and guns and used to deliver fuel .
B-29s started to arrive in India in early April 1944 .
The first B-29 flight to airfields in China ( over the Himalayas , or " The Hump " ) took place on 24 April 1944 .
The first B-29 combat mission was flown on 5 June 1944 , with 77 out of 98 B-29s launched from India bombing the railroad shops in Bangkok and elsewhere in Thailand .
Five B-29s were lost during the mission , none to hostile fire .
FORWARD BASE IN CHINA Section::::Forward base in China .
On 5 June 1944 , B-29s raided Bangkok , in what is reported as a test before being deployed against the Japanese home islands .
Sources do not report from where they launched , and vary as to the numbers involved—77 , 98 , and 114 being claimed .
Targets were Bangkok 's Memorial Bridge and a major power plant .
Bombs fell over two kilometres away , damaged no civilian structures , but destroyed some tram lines and destroyed both a Japanese military hospital and the Japanese secret police headquarters .
On 15 June 1944 , 68 B-29s took off from bases around Chengdu , 47 B-29s bombed the Imperial Iron and Steel Works at Yawata , Kyoto Prefecture , Japan .
This was the first attack on Japanese islands since the Doolittle raid in April 1942 .
The first B-29 combat losses occurred during this raid , with one B-29 destroyed on the ground by Japanese fighters after an emergency landing in China , one lost to anti - aircraft fire over Yawata , and another , the Stockett 's Rocket ( after Capt .
Marvin M. Stockett , Aircraft Commander )
B-29 - 1-BW 42 - 6261 , disappeared after takeoff from Chakulia , India , over the Himalayas ( 12 KIA , 11 crew and one passenger )
This raid , which did little damage to the target , with only one bomb striking the target factory complex , nearly exhausted fuel stocks at the Chengdu B-29 bases , resulting in a slow - down of operations until the fuel stockpiles could be replenished .
Starting in July , the raids against Japan from Chinese airfields continued at relatively low intensity .
Japan was bombed on : 7 July 1944 ( 14 B-29s ) , 29 July ( 70 + ) , 10 August ( 24 ) , 20 August ( 61 ) , 8 September ( 90 ) , 26 September ( 83 ) , 25 October ( 59 ) , 12 November ( 29 ) , 21 November ( 61 ) , 19 December ( 36 ) and for the last time on 6 January 1945 ( 49 ) .
The tactic of using aircraft to ram American B-29s was first recorded on the raid of 20 August 1944 on the steel factories at Yawata .
Sergeant Shigeo Nobe of the 4th Sentai intentionally flew his Kawasaki Ki-45 into a B-29 ; debris from the explosion following this attack severely damaged another B-29 , which also went down .
Lost were Colonel Robert Clinksale 's B-29 - 10-BW 42 - 6334 Gertrude C and Captain Ornell Stauffer 's B-29 - 15-BW 42 - 6368 Calamity Sue , both from the 486th BG .
Several B-29s were destroyed in this way over the ensuing months .
Although the term " Kamikaze " is often used to refer to the pilots conducting these attacks , the word was not used by the Japanese military .
B-29s were withdrawn from airfields in China by the end of January 1945 .
Throughout this prior period , B-29 raids were also launched from China and India against many other targets throughout Southeast Asia , including a series of raids on Singapore and Thailand .
On 2 November 1944 , 55 B-29s raided Bangkok 's Bang Sue marshalling yards in the largest raid of the war .
Seven RTAF Nakajima Ki-43
Hayabusas from Foong Bin ( Air Group ) 16 and 14 IJAAF Ki-43s attempted intercept .
RTAF Flt Lt Therdsak Worrasap attacked a B-29 , damaging it , but was shot down by return fire .
One B-29 was lost , possibly the one damaged by Flt Lt Therdsak .
On 14 April 1945 , a second B-29 raid on Bangkok destroyed two key power plants , and was the last major attack conducted against Thai targets .
The B-29 effort was gradually shifted to the new bases in the Mariana Islands in the Central Pacific , with the last B-29 combat mission from India flown on 29 March 1945 .
NEW MARIANA ISLANDS AIR BASES Section::::New Mariana Islands air bases .
In addition to the logistical problems associated with operations from China , the B-29 could only reach a limited part of Japan while flying from Chinese bases .
The solution to this problem was to capture the Mariana Islands , which would bring targets such as Tokyo , about north of the Marianas within range of B-29 attacks .
The Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed in December 1943 to seize the Marianas .
US forces invaded Saipan on 15 June 1944 .
Despite a Japanese naval counterattack which led to the Battle of the Philippine Sea and heavy fighting on land , Saipan was secured by 9 July .
Operations followed against Guam and Tinian , with all three islands secured by August .
Naval construction battalions ( Seabees ) began at once to construct air bases suitable for the B-29 , commencing even before the end of ground fighting .
In all , five major air fields were built : two on the flat island of Tinian , one on Saipan , and two on Guam .
Each was large enough to eventually accommodate a bomb wing consisting of four bomb groups , giving a total of 180 B-29s per airfield .
These bases could be supplied by ship , and unlike the bases in China , were not vulnerable to attacks by Japanese ground forces .
The bases became the launch sites for the large B-29 raids against Japan in the final year of the war .
The first B-29 arrived on Saipan on 12 October 1944 , and the first combat mission was launched from there on 28 October 1944 , with 14 B-29s attacking the Truk atoll .
The 73rd Bomb Wing launched the first mission against Japan from bases in the Marianas , on 24 November 1944 , sending 111 B-29s to attack Tokyo .
For this first attack on the Japanese capital since the Doolittle Raid in April 1942 , 73rd Bomb Wing wing commander Brigadier General Emmett O'Donnell Jr. acted as mission command pilot in B-29 Dauntless Dotty .
The campaign of incendiary raids started with the bombardment of Kobe on February 4 , 1945 , then peaked early with the most destructive bombing raid in human history ( even when the later Silverplate - flown nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki are considered ) on the night of March 9–10 , 1945 on Tokyo .
From then on , the raids intensified , being launched regularly until the end of the war .
The attacks succeeded in devastating most large Japanese cities ( with the exception of Kyoto and several others ) , and they gravely damaged Japan 's war industries .
Although less publicly appreciated , the mining of Japanese ports and shipping routes ( Operation Starvation ) carried out by B-29s
from April 1945 reduced Japan 's ability to support its population and move its troops .
THE ATOMIC BOMBS Section::::The atomic bombs .
Perhaps the most famous B-29s were the sixty - five examples of the Silverplate series , which were modified to drop atomic bombs .
They were also stripped of all guns , except the tail ones , in order to have a lighter plane .
The Silverplate aircraft were handpicked by Lieutenant Colonel Paul W. Tibbets for the mission , straight off the assembly line at the Omaha plant that was to become Offutt Air Force Base .
The Silverplate bombers differed from other B-29s then in service by having fuel injection and reversible props .
Pilot Charles Sweeney credits the reversible props for saving Bockscar after making an emergency landing on Okinawa following the Nagasaki bombing .
Enola Gay , flown by Tibbets , dropped the first bomb , called Little Boy , on Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 .
Enola Gay is fully restored and on display at the Smithsonian 's Steven F. Udvar - Hazy Center , outside Dulles Airport in Washington ,
D.C. Bockscar dropped the second bomb , called Fat Man , on Nagasaki three days later .
Bockscar is on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force .
Following the surrender of Japan , called V - J Day , B-29s were used for other purposes .
A number supplied POWs with food and other necessities by dropping barrels of rations on Japanese POW camps .
In September 1945 , a long - distance flight was undertaken for public relations purposes : Generals Barney M. Giles , Curtis LeMay , and Emmett O'Donnell Jr. piloted three specially modified B-29s from Chitose Air Base in Hokkaidō to Chicago Municipal Airport , continuing to Washington , D.C. , the farthest nonstop distance ( c.6400 miles ) to that date flown by U.S. Army Air Forces aircraft and the first - ever nonstop flight from Japan to Chicago .
Two months later , Colonel Clarence S. Irvine commanded another modified B-29 , Pacusan Dreamboat , in a world - record - breaking long - distance flight from Guam to Washington , D.C. , traveling in 35 hours , with a gross takeoff weight of .
Almost a year later , in October 1946 , the same B-29 flew 9,422 miles nonstop from Oahu , Hawaii , to Cairo , Egypt , in less than 40 hours , further proving the capability of routing airlines over the polar icecap .
B-29S IN EUROPE AND AUSTRALIA
Section::::B-29s in Europe and Australia .
Although considered for other theaters , and briefly evaluated in the United Kingdom , the B-29 was exclusively used in World War II in the Pacific Theatre .
The use of YB-29-BW 41 - 36393 , the so - named Hobo Queen , one of the service test aircraft flown around several British airfields in early 1944 , was part of a " disinformation " program from its mention in an American - published German language propaganda leaflet from Leap Year Day in 1944 , meant to be circulated within the Reich , with the intent to deceive the Germans into believing that the B-29 would be deployed to Europe .
American post - war military assistance programs loaned the RAF enough Superfortresses to equip several RAF Bomber Command squadrons .
The aircraft were known as the Washington B.1 in RAF service , and served from March 1950 until the last bombers were returned in early 1954 .
The phase out was occasioned by deliveries of the English Electric Canberra bombers .
Three Washingtons modified for ELINT duties and a standard bomber version used for support by No . 192 Squadron RAF were decommissioned in 1958 , being replaced by de Havilland Comet aircraft .
Two British Washington B.1 aircraft were transferred to the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) in 1952 .
They were attached to the Aircraft Research and Development Unit and used in trials conducted on behalf of the British Ministry of Supply .
Both aircraft were placed in storage in 1956 and were sold for scrap in 1957 .
SOVIET TUPOLEV
TU-4 Section::::Soviet Tupolev Tu-4 .
At the end of World War II , Soviet development with modern four - engined heavy bombers lagged behind the west .
The Petlyakov Pe-8 — the sole heavy bomber operated by the Soviet Air Forces — first flew in 1936 .
Intended to replace the obsolete Tupolev TB-3 , only 93 Pe-8s were built by the end of World War II .
During 1944 and 1945 five B-29s made emergency landings in Soviet territory after bombing raids on Japanese Manchuria and Japan .
In accordance with Soviet neutrality in the Pacific War , the bombers were interned by the Soviets despite American requests for their return .
Rather than return the aircraft , the Soviets reverse engineered the American B-29s and used them as a pattern for the Tupolev Tu-4 . On 31 July 1944 Ramp Tramp ( serial number 42 - 6256 ) , of the United States Army Air Force 462nd ( Very Heavy ) Bomb Group was diverted to Vladivostok , Russia , after an engine failed and the propeller could not be feathered .
This B-29 was part of a 100-aircraft raid against the Japanese Showa steel mill in Anshan , Manchuria .
On 20 August 1944 , Cait Paomat ( 42 - 93829 ) , flying from Chengdu , was damaged by anti - aircraft gunfire during a raid on the Yawata Iron Works .
Due to the damage sustained , the crew elected to divert to the Soviet Union .
The aircraft crashed in the foothills of Sikhote - Alin mountain range east of Khabarovsk after the crew bailed out .
On 11 November 1944 , during a night raid on Omura on Kyushu Japan , the General H.H. Arnold Special ( 42 - 6365 ) was damaged and forced to divert to Vladivostok in the Soviet Union .
The crew was interned .
On 21 November 1944 , Ding Hao ( 42 - 6358 ) was damaged during a raid on an aircraft factory at Omura , Japan , and was also forced to divert to Vladivostok .
The interned crews of these four B-29s were allowed to escape into American - occupied Iran in January 1945 but none of the B-29s were returned after Stalin ordered the Tupolev OKB to examine and copy the B-29 , and produce a design ready for quantity production as soon as possible .
Because aluminum in the USSR was supplied in different gauges from that available in the US ( metric vs imperial ) , the entire aircraft had to be extensively re - engineered .
In addition , Tupolev substituted his own favored airfoil sections for those used by Boeing , with the Soviets themselves already having their own Wright R-1820-derived 18 cylinder radial engine , the Shvetsov ASh-73 of comparable power and displacement to the B-29 's Duplex Cyclone radials available to power their design .
In 1947 , the Soviets debuted both the Tupolev Tu-4
( NATO ASCC code named Bull ) , and the Tupolev Tu-70 transport variant .
The Soviets used tail - gunner positions similar to the B-29 in many later bombers and transports .
TRANSITION TO USAF Section::::Transition to USAF .
Production of the B-29 was phased out after World War II with the last example completed by Boeing 's Renton factory on 28 May 1946 .
Many aircraft went into storage , being declared excess inventory and were ultimately scrapped as surplus .
Others remained in the active inventory and equipped the Strategic Air Command when it formed on 21 March 1946 .
In particular , the " Silverplate " modified aircraft of the 509th Composite Group remained the only aircraft capable of delivering the atomic bomb , and so the unit was involved in the Operation Crossroads series of tests , with B-29 Dave 's Dream dropping a " Fat Man"-type bomb in Test Able on 1 July 1946 .
Some B-29s , fitted with filtered air sampling scoops , were used to monitor above ground nuclear weapons testing by the United States and the USSR by sampling airborne radioactive contamination .
The USAF also used the aircraft for long - range weather reconnaissance ( WB-29 ) , for signals intelligence gathering ( EB-29 ) and photographic reconnaissance ( RB-29 ) .
KOREAN WAR AND POSTWAR SERVICE Section::::Korean War and postwar service .
The B-29 was used in 1950–53 in the Korean War .
At first , the bomber was used in normal strategic day - bombing missions , though North Korea 's few strategic targets and industries were quickly reduced to rubble .
More importantly , in 1950 numbers of Soviet MiG-15 jet fighters appeared over Korea , and after the loss of 28 aircraft , future B-29 raids were restricted to night - only missions , largely in a supply - interdiction role .
Over the course of the war , B-29s flew 20,000 sorties and dropped 200,000 tonnes ( 180,000 tons ) of bombs .
B-29 gunners were credited with shooting down 27 enemy aircraft .
The B-29 dropped the 1,000-lb VB-3 " Razon " ( a range - controllable version of the earlier Azon guided ordnance device ) and the 12,000 lb . VB-13
" Tarzon " MCLOS radio - controlled bombs in Korea , mostly for demolishing major bridges , like the ones across the Yalu River , and for attacks on dams .
The aircraft also was used for numerous leaflet drops in North Korea , such as those for Operation Moolah .
A Superfortress of the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron flew the last B-29 mission of the war on 27 July 1953 .
Over the three years 16 B-29 and reconnaissance variants were lost to North Korean fighters , four to anti - aircraft fire and 14 to other operational causes .
With the arrival of the mammoth Convair B-36 , the B-29 was reclassified as a medium bomber by the Air Force .
However , the later B-50 Superfortress variant ( initially designated B-29D ) was good enough to handle auxiliary roles such as air - sea rescue , electronic intelligence gathering , air - to - air refueling , and weather reconnaissance .
The B-50D was replaced in its primary role during the early 1950s by the Boeing B-47 Stratojet , which in turn was replaced by the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress .
The final active - duty KB-50 and WB-50 variants were phased out in the mid-1960s , with the final example retired in 1965 .
A total of 3,970 B-29s were built .
VARIANTS Section::::Variants .
The variants of the B-29 were outwardly similar in appearance but were in fact built around different wing center sections that affected the wingspan dimensions .
The wing of the Renton built B-29A - BN used a different subassembly process and was a foot longer in span .
The Georgia built B-29B - BA weighed less through armament reduction .
A planned C series with more reliable R-3350s was not built .
Moreover , engine packages changed including the type of propellers and range of the variable pitch .
A notable example were the Silverplate project built for the Manhattan Project with Curtiss Electric reversible pitch propellers .
The other differences came about through added equipment for varied mission roles .
These roles included cargo carriers ( CB ) ; rescue aircraft ( SB ) ; weather ships ( WB ) ; and trainers ( TB ) ; and aerial tankers ( KB ) .
Some were used for odd purposes such as flying relay television transmitters under the name of Stratovision .
The B-29D led progressively to the XB-44 , and the family of B-50 Superfortress ( which was powered by four Pratt & Whitney R-4360 - 35 Wasp Major engines ) .
Another role was as a mothership .
This included being rigged for carrying the experimental parasite fighter aircraft , such as the McDonnell XF-85 Goblin and Republic F-84 Thunderjets as in flight lock on and offs .
It was also used to develop the Airborne Early Warning program ; it was the ancestor of various modern radar picket aircraft .
A B-29 with the original Wright Duplex Cyclone powerplants was used to air - launch the famous Bell X-1 supersonic research rocket aircraft , as well as Cherokee rockets for the testing of ejection seats .
Some B-29s were modified to act as test beds for various new systems or special conditions , including fire - control systems , cold - weather operations , and various armament configurations .
Several converted B-29s were used to experiment with aerial refueling and re - designated as KB-29s .
Perhaps the most important tests were conducted by the XB-29 G ; it carried prototype jet engines in its bomb bay , and lowered them into the air stream to conduct measurements .

SURVIVING AIRCRAFT
Section::::Surviving aircraft .
