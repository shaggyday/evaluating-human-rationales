TERMINAL DEGREE
A terminal degree is a university degree that can signify one of two outcomes .
In some cases , it is the highest degree that can be awarded in a specific academic or professional track .
In other cases , it is a degree that is awarded when a candidate completes a certain amount of coursework but does not go on to doctoral work .
Some students enroll in a terminal Master 's program with the goal of preparing to enter a PhD program .
For certain professions and research grants it means the lowest degree to be considered qualified .
An earned academic ( or research ) doctorate such as a PhD is considered the terminal degree in most academic fields , as well as the most advanced degree possible , advancing the boundaries of human knowledge through research and dissertation defense , in the United States .
However , professional doctorates may be considered terminal degrees within the professional degree track , even though they are prerequisites for research degrees .
The phrase " terminal degree " is used heavily in the United States , but is used less often outside that country .
The term is not generally used in the United Kingdom or Canada , for example , and its exact meaning varies somewhat between those areas and disciplines in which the term is used .
In some countries there are degrees which are more advanced than the PhD , such as the higher doctorates in the United Kingdom and Russia , and the habilitation degree awarded in Germany , where this degree would be equivalent to a Doctor of Philosophy in the United States .
Not all terminal degrees are doctorates .
For example , in professional practice fields there are often terminal master - level degrees , some which are called doctorates e.g. , Doctor of Jurisprudence and Doctor of Medicine , as well as , MEng ( Master of Engineering ) , MLArch and MArch standing for Master Landscape Architect and Master Architect or even bachelor - level degrees such as BArch which stands for Bachelor of Architecture or BEng for Engineers , MB ( Bachelor of Medicine - UK ) .
Interior design and Interior Architecture have terminal master - level degrees such as MID , MA , MS Interior design education .
Most non - doctoral degrees are not terminal in academic terms , with the exception of the Master of Fine Arts ( MFA ) .
The MFA is an academically recognized terminal degree and is given to practitioners in the fine arts and performing arts .
The MBA , and the MAT are also considered terminal professional degrees .
RESEARCH DEGREES Section::::Research degrees .
In academic fields , the typical terminal degree is that of Doctor of Philosophy , although others also exist .
The first phase of the Ph.D. consists of coursework in the student 's field of study and requires one to three years to complete .
This is often followed by a preliminary or comprehensive examination and/or a series of cumulative examinations , in which the emphasis is on breadth rather than depth of knowledge .
Finally , another two to four years is usually required for the composition of a substantial and original contribution to human knowledge embodied in a written dissertation that in the social sciences and humanities is typically 250 to 450 pages in length .
Dissertations generally consist of ( i ) a comprehensive literature review , ( ii ) an outline of methodology , and ( iii ) several chapters of scientific , social , historical , philosophical , or literary analysis .
Typically , upon completion , the candidate undergoes an oral examination , sometimes public , by his or her supervisory committee with expertise in the given discipline .

The Doctor of Criminal Justice ( DCJ ) is a professional doctorate ( terminal degree ) that is awarded on the basis of advanced study and research in the field of criminal justice .
Structurally , the Doctor of Criminal Justice differs from the PhD in that the DCJ has , as noted above , at least a three year duration , with only one year equivalent on the dissertation , while an American PhD in criminal justice would normally require a minimum of four years , with at least two years spent on the dissertation .
The Doctor of Criminal Justice ( DCJ ) prepares the holder for research and academic positions .
It also prepares the holder for professional positions in the American criminal justice system .
PROFESSIONAL DEGREES Section::::Professional degrees .
A professional degree is a degree that is required , often by law as in the case of medical and other clinical professions , that must be earned first before the holder of the degree can practice in the profession .
A speech - language pathologist , for example , must hold a master 's degree in communicative disorders : speech - language pathology in order to practice .
However , an actor does not need a degree to act , even though there are degrees for acting available .
In some fields , especially those linked to a profession ( such as medicine , law or teaching ) , a distinction is to be drawn between a first professional degree , an advanced professional degree , and a terminal academic degree .
A first professional degree is generally required by law or custom to practice the profession without limitation .
An advanced professional degree provides further training in a specialized area of the profession .
A first professional degree is an academic degree designed to prepare the holder for a particular career or profession , fields in which scholarly research and academic activity are not the profession , but rather the practice of the profession .
In many cases such as law , medicine and teaching , the first professional degree is also terminal , usually because no further advanced degree is required for practice in that field , even though more advanced academic degrees may exist .
