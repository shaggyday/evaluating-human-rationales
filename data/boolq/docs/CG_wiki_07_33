ONTARIO HUMAN RIGHTS CODE
The Ontario Human Rights Code is a law in the Canadian province of Ontario that gives all people equal rights and opportunities without discrimination in specific areas such as housing and services .
The Code 's goal is to prevent discrimination and harassment because of race , colour , gender identity or expression , sex , sexual orientation , disability , creed , age and other grounds .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The Ontario Human Rights Code was the first law of its kind in Canada .
Before June 15 , 1962 , various laws dealt with different kinds of discrimination .
The Code brought them together into one law and added some new protections .
The Ontario Human Rights Code took effect on June 15 , 1962 , and it was the first Human Rights Code of its kind in Canada .
June 15 was chosen as the proclamation date for the Human Rights Code because it was the 747th anniversary of the signing of the Magna Carta .
The Ontario Human Rights Code of 1962 replaced the province 's existing anti - discrimination legislation , including : * Fair Employment Practices Act , 1951 which prohibited discrimination based on race and religion in employment ; * Female Employee 's Fair Remuneration Act , 1951 which prohibited an employer from paying a female employee less money for the same work done by a man in the same establishment
* Fair Accommodation Practices Act , 1954 which prohibited discrimination in public places on racial , religious or ethnic grounds ; * Ontario Anti - Discrimination Commission Act , 1958 which created a commission to administer the above acts and develop educational programs ; At the same time that the Ontario Human Rights Commission was created , the government of the day , led by Premier Leslie Frost introduced an amendment to the Fair Accommodation Practices Act to prohibit discrimination because of race , colour or creed in the renting of apartments in buildings which contain more than 6 units .
