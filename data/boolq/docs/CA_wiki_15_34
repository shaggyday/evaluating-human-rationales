ROCK STAR ( 2001 FILM )
Rock Star is a 2001 American musical comedy - drama film directed by Stephen Herek and starring Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston .
It tells the story of Chris " Izzy " Cole , a tribute band singer who ascended to the position of lead vocalist of his favorite band , which was inspired by the real - life story of Tim " Ripper " Owens , singer in a Judas Priest tribute band who was chosen to replace singer Rob Halford when he left the band .
PLOT Section::::Plot .
In the mid-1980s , Chris Cole ( Mark Wahlberg ) is a Pittsburgh fanatical admirer of a heavy metal band called Steel Dragon .
By day , Chris is a photocopier technician and by night , he is the lead singer of a Steel Dragon tribute band called Blood Pollution ( the name is taken from a Steel Dragon song ) .
Internal struggles among the actual Steel Dragon band members culminate with the firing of their lead singer , Bobby Beers ( Jason Flemyng ) , and the beginning of recruitment sessions to find a new vocalist .
Chris experiences his own strife with his Blood Pollution bandmates , particularly guitarist Rob Malcolm ( Timothy Olyphant ) .
During a live performance , Rob 's playing fails to live up to Chris ' over - demanding standards regarding note - for - note accuracy to the original Steel Dragon recordings , and Chris sabotages Rob 's amplifier mid - song – a fight breaks out between the two onstage .
The next day , Chris meets Blood Pollution at a rehearsal session , but he finds out that he has been replaced with his arch - rival , the ( now former ) lead singer of another Steel Dragon tribute band .
Rob also cites Chris ' inability to create his own musical style , preferring to remain the singer in a tribute band .
One day , Chris receives an unexpected phone call from Steel Dragon 's founder and rhythm guitarist , Kirk Cuddy ( Dominic West ) , and is offered an audition for the band ( thanks to two of Blood Pollution 's groupies , who showed Kirk a videotape of one of Blood Pollution 's concerts ) .
After hanging up on Kirk once , thinking he 's being pranked by Rob , Chris ecstatically agrees .
At the studio , he meets the band and gives an outstanding performance of " We All Die Young " ( a Steel Dragon song in the movie , but it is actually a song by Steelheart , whose lead vocalist Miljenko Matijevic provides Cole 's singing voice for the film ) .
Chris joins the band as their new singer , adopting the stage name " Izzy " .
Following a successful debut concert with Steel Dragon , Izzy must come to grips with the pressures of his new - found fame and success .
The band embarks on a lengthy tour and Izzy experiences the excesses of the lifestyle , with the group 's road manager , Mats ( Timothy Spall ) , serving as a sympathetic mentor to Izzy .
His new lifestyle impacts his life both for better and worse , particularly with his relationship with his supportive girlfriend , Emily Poule ( Jennifer Aniston ) , when she decides not to continue with him throughout the remainder of the tour as a rock star girlfriend , though Emily and Izzy agree to get back together when the tour reaches Seattle .
Eventually , Steel Dragon stops in Seattle for a show , and Emily arrives at his hotel room as they had previously arranged , although Izzy had become so inebriated while on tour he forgot about the arrangement and did not even know what city he was in .
Although taken aback by all the groupies , Emily still tries to reconnect with him , reminding him of their plans to meet up once he got to Seattle , however he is too intoxicated to really understand what she is saying , eventually suggesting they go to Seattle together .
Heartbroken with his inconsiderate behavior , intoxication and the fact that he is sleeping with so many groupies , Emily leaves him .
After the end of the tour , Izzy reports to the next series of Steel Dragon recording sessions with song concepts and artwork for the band 's next album .
The rest of the band rejects Izzy 's ideas , with Kirk explaining that the band has to stay true to the " Steel Dragon thing " to fulfill fan expectations .
Izzy is angered upon realizing that he was only recruited for his vocal abilities .
After a heartfelt conversation with Mats about how he feared he had no control over the direction life has taken him , Izzy begins to reconsider his rock star lifestyle .
On the next tour , in a scene directly paralleling one near the beginning of the film with their roles reversed , Izzy hears a fan ( Myles Kennedy ) singing along with him toward the end of a live concert .
Impressed , Izzy pulls the fan , who introduces himself as Thor , onstage and hands him the microphone to finish the concert .
Backstage , Izzy realizes that what he thought he wanted for so long was not what he wanted , and he says goodbye to Mats , departing from the band while doing so .
Upon ditching his stage name , Izzy , Chris makes his way to Seattle and starts a new band with his old friend and former bandmate Rob .
At the same time Steel Dragon , failing to evolve to the changing tastes and styles of the 1990s ( as glam metal was pushed aside for grunge ) , has its fame fizzle out .
Chris finds Emily working in the coffee shop
she and her roommate purchased a few years earlier , but is initially too ashamed to speak to her .
While walking one evening , Emily sees a flyer for his band posted on the wall and takes it down .
In the final scene , Chris is singing with his band in a bar and Emily walks in .
Chris leaves the stage and speaks to her .
They reconcile , ending the film with a kiss and the final note of Chris ' first original song " Colorful " ( which is actually a song by The Verve Pipe ) .
During the credits , Cuddy talks about the future of the band and Beers is shown to have taken up Irish Dancing after his sacking from Steel Dragon .

On another aggregator , Metacritic , the film is rated 54 based on 32 reviews .
When Judas Priest bassist Ian Hill was asked about his reaction to Rock Star in an interview in PopMatters magazine Hill responded "
Well , it was a true work of fiction , you know ?
When we heard about the production company were going to make a movie based , as far as we knew , about Ripper joining the band we offered our help .
We said ' If there 's anything you want to know , talk to us at the time . '
And certainly our communication was cut off and that was it
and they went off on their own tangent .
"
Hill added " I mean , I quite enjoyed the movie .
It was entertaining , you know ?
" Hill was quoted as saying " It had nothing to do with Rob Halford , Ripper Owens and Judas Priest , it 's got nothing to do with that , whatsoever .
It was fiction .
Apart from the fact that ' Local Boy Makes Good ' ?
That was the only true aspect of the movie .
"
Hill was quick to add
" I watched it once .
I do n't have the urge to watch it again . "
