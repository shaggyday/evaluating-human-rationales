TRAVELERS AND FIREARMS Section::::Travelers and firearms .
While Massachusetts ' firearms laws are some of the most strict in the United States , they are not applicable to travelers who comply with the Firearm Owners Protection Act 's traveler 's exemption .
FIREARM STORAGE Section::::Firearm storage .
Unless carried or under the control of the owner , state law requires all firearms to be stored in a locked container , or equipped with a tamper - resistant mechanical lock or other safety device ( see trigger lock ) , properly engaged so as to render such weapon inoperable by any person other than the owner or other lawfully authorized user .
If in a vehicle , firearm must be unloaded and contained within the locked trunk of such vehicle or in a locked case or other secure container , unless the licensee has a Class A license , in which case the firearm must be under the licensee 's direct control .
Any firearms that are found to be unsecured may be confiscated by law enforcement officers and license may be revoked .
In the event a license is revoked for any reason , law enforcement will confiscate all weapons and store them for 1 year before destroying them unless the revoked licensee transfers ownership to a properly licensed party who then claims the firearms .
Also , gun license holders may encounter licensing issues when moving from one town to another .
While one city or town police chief may have issued a license , the chief of police in the city or town where the license holder may move does not have to authorize it , and may require that guns be surrendered .
If a gun license is not authorized , and the police determine that the resident also holds a license in a different state , they may contact law enforcement in that state and inform them of the action , which could lead to the loss of the out - of - state license as well .
ALIEN PERMITS
Section::::Alien permits .
Aliens who reside in Massachusetts can apply for a " permit to possess non large capacity rifles and shotguns pursuant M.G.L. 140 s. 131H " directly with the Massachusetts Firearms Record Bureau .
The applicants must receive firearms education at the FID or LTC - level and pass a 20-fingerprint FBI background check and interview .
This permit is a " may issue " document similar to the FID but expiring December 31 of each year .
The procedure requires about 16 weeks from application to delivery of the permit .
There is no 90-day grace period for the renewal of alien permits .
Both nonresident ( i.e. visa - holders ) and permanent resident ( i.e. green - card holders )
aliens are lumped together by Massachusetts law .
The alien permit allows the possession of non - high capacity ( 10 rounds or less ) shotguns , rifles , and ammunition .
This includes .22 caliber rifles with tubular magazines holding more than 10 rounds , but it excludes high capacity rifles , assault rifles , and handguns .
FID and LTC are generally not issued to aliens even though Massachusetts law grants some latitude to the Colonel of Massachusetts State Police , who may be petitioned directly .

Alien permits are still in existence and required for all non - permanent resident aliens in Massachusetts .
