ACADEMY AWARD FOR BEST DIRECTOR
The Academy Award for Best Director ( officially known as the Academy Award for Best Directing ) is an award presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ( AMPAS ) .
It is given in honor of a film director who has exhibited outstanding directing while working in the film industry .
The 1st Academy Awards ceremony was held in 1929 with the award being split into " Dramatic " and " Comedy " categories ; Frank Borzage and Lewis Milestone won for 7th Heaven and Two Arabian Knights , respectively .
However , these categories were merged for all subsequent ceremonies .
Nominees are determined by single transferable vote within the directors branch of AMPAS ; winners are selected by a plurality vote from the entire eligible voting members of the Academy .
For the first eleven years of the Academy Awards , directors were allowed to be nominated for multiple films in the same year .
However , after the nomination of Michael Curtiz for two films , Angels with Dirty Faces and Four Daughters , at the 11th Academy Awards , the rules were revised so that an individual could only be nominated for one film at each ceremony .
That rule has since been amended , although the only director who has received multiple nominations in the same year was Steven Soderbergh for Erin Brockovich and Traffic in 2000 , winning the award for the latter .
The Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture have been very closely linked throughout their history .
Of the 90 films that have been awarded Best Picture , 64 have also been awarded Best Director .
Since its inception , the award has been given to 69 directors or directing teams .
John Ford has received the most awards in this category with four .
William Wyler was nominated on twelve occasions , more than any other individual .
Damien Chazelle became the youngest director in history to receive this award , at the age of 32 for his work on La La Land .
Two directing teams have shared the award ; Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins for West Side Story in 1961 and Joel and Ethan Coen for No Country for Old Men in 2007 .
The Coen brothers are the only siblings to have won the award .
Kathryn Bigelow is the only woman to have won the award , for 2009 's The Hurt Locker .
As of the 2018 ceremony , Guillermo del Toro is the most recent winner in this category for his work on The Shape of Water .
