CHARACTER HISTORY Section::::Character history .
Esmeralda 's birth - name was Agnès .
She is the love child of Paquette Guybertaut , nicknamed ' la Chantefleurie ' , an orphaned minstrel 's daughter who lives in Rheims .
Paquette has become a prostitute after being seduced by a young nobleman , and lives a miserable life in poverty and loneliness .
Agnes 's birth makes Paquette happy once more , and she lavishes attention and care upon her adored child : even the neighbours begin to forgive Paquette for her past behaviour when they watch the pair .
Tragedy strikes , however , when Gypsies kidnap the young baby , leaving a hideously deformed child ( the infant Quasimodo ) in place .
The townsfolk come to the conclusion that the Gypsies have cannibalised baby Agnes ; the mother flees Rheims in despair , and the deformed child is exorcised and sent to Paris , to be left on the foundling bed at Notre - Dame .
Fifteen years later , Agnes — now named La Esmeralda , in reference to the paste emerald she wears around her neck — is living happily amongst the Gypsies in Paris .
She serves as a public dancer .
Her pet goat Djali also performs counting tricks with a tambourine , an act later used as courtroom evidence that Esmeralda is a witch .
Claude Frollo sends his adopted son Quasimodo to kidnap Esmeralda from the streets .
Esmeralda is rescued by Captain Phoebus , with whom she instantly falls in love to the point of obsession .
Later that night , Clopin Trouillefou , the King of the Truands , prepares to execute a poet named Pierre Gringoire for trespassing the Truands ' territory known as The Court of Miracles .
In a compassionate act to save his life , Esmeralda agrees to marry Gringoire .
When Quasimodo is sentenced to the pillory for his attempted kidnapping , it is Esmeralda , his victim , who pities him and serves him water .
Because of this , he falls deeply in love with her , even though she is too disgusted by his ugliness even to let him kiss her hand .
There , Paquette la Chantefleurie , now known as Sister Gudule , an anchoress , curses Esmeralda , claiming she and the other Gypsies ate her lost child .
Two months later , Esmeralda is walking in the streets when Fleur - de - Lys de Gondelaurier , the fiancée of Phoebus , and her wealthy , aristocratic friends spot the Gypsy girl from the Gondelaurier house .
Fleur - de - Lys becomes jealous of Esmeralda 's beauty and pretends to not see her , but Fleur 's friends call Esmeralda to them out of curiosity .
When Esmeralda enters the room , tension immediately appears — the wealthy young women , who all appear equally pretty when compared to each other , are plain in comparison to Esmeralda .
Knowing that Esmeralda 's beauty far surpasses their own , the aristocrats make fun of her clothes instead .
Phoebus tries to make Esmeralda feel better , but Fleur grabs Esmeralda 's bag and opens it .
Pieces of wood with letters written on them fall out , and Djali moves the letters to spell out " Phoebus " .
Fleur , realizing that she now has competition , calls Esmeralda a witch and passes out .
Esmeralda runs off , and Phoebus follows her .
Later that month , she meets with Phoebus and declares her love for him .
Phoebus takes the opportunity to kiss her as she speaks , and he pretends to love her .
He asks Esmeralda what the point of marriage is ( he has no intentions of leaving his fiancée Fleur - de - Lys , he just wants to " sleep " with Esmeralda ) , which leaves the girl hurt .
Phoebus , seeing the girl 's reaction , pretends to be sad and says that Esmeralda must no longer love him .
Esmeralda then says that she does love him and will do whatever he asks .
Phoebus begins to undo Esmeralda 's shirt and kisses her again .
Frollo , who was watching from behind a door , bursts into the room in a jealous rage , stabs Phoebus , and flees .
Esmeralda passes out at the sight of Frollo , and when she comes to , she finds herself framed for murder , for a miscommunication makes the jury believe that Phoebus is in fact dead .
Esmeralda proclaims her innocence , but when she is threatened with having her foot crushed in a vice , she confesses .
The court sentences her to death for murder and witchcraft ( the court has seen Djali 's spelling trick ) , and she is locked away in a cell .
Frollo visits her , and Esmeralda hides in the corner ( before this point in the book , the readers know that Frollo 's lustful obsession of the girl has caused him to publicly denounce and stalk her ) .
Frollo tells Esmeralda about his inner conflict about her , and he gives her an ultimatum : give herself to him or face death .
Esmeralda , repulsed that Frollo would harm her to this extent for his own selfishness , refuses .
Frollo , mad with emotion , leaves the city .
The next day , minutes before she is to be hanged , Quasimodo dramatically arrives from Notre Dame , takes Esmeralda , and runs back in while crying , " Sanctuary ! " .
While she stays in the cell at Notre Dame , she slowly becomes friendly with Quasimodo and is able to look past his misshapen exterior .
Quasimodo gives her a high - pitched whistle , one of the few things he can still hear , and instructs her to use it whenever she needs help .
One day , Esmeralda spots Phoebus walking past the cathedral .
She asks Quasimodo to follow the captain , but when Quasimodo finds where Phoebus is , he sees Phoebus leaving his fiancée 's house .
Quasimodo tells him that Esmeralda wants to see him : Phoebus , believing Esmeralda to be dead , believes Quasimodo to be a devil summoning him to Esmeralda in Hell , and flees in terror .
Quasimodo returns and says he did not find Phoebus .
For weeks Esmeralda and Quasimodo live a quiet life , whilst Frollo hides in his private chambers thinking about what to do next .
One night , he brings his master key to Esmeralda 's room .
The girl wakes up and is paralyzed with terror until Frollo pins her to the bed with his body and tries to rape her .
Unable to fight him off , Esmeralda grabs the whistle and frantically blows it .
Before Frollo can make sense of her actions , Quasimodo picks him up , slams him against the wall , and beats him with the intention of killing him .
Before Quasimodo can finish , Frollo stumbles into the moonlight pouring in from a far window .
Quasimodo sees who Esmeralda 's attacker is , and drops him in surprise .
Frollo fumes with fury , and tells Esmeralda that no one will have her if he can not , before leaving the cathedral .
Frollo finds Gringoire and informs him that the Parlement has voted to remove Esmeralda from the sanctuary , and intends to order soldiers to forcibly accomplish the task .
Gringoire reluctantly agrees to save the girl , and formulates a plan with Frollo .
The next night , Gringoire leads all the Parisian Gypsies to Notre Dame to rescue Esmeralda .
Mistakenly responding to this assault , Quasimodo retaliates and uses Notre Dame 's defenses to fight the gypsies , thinking that these people want to turn in Esmeralda .
News of this soon comes to King Louis XI , and he sends soldiers ( including Phoebus ) to end the riot and hang Esmeralda .
They reach Notre Dame in time to save Quasimodo , who is outnumbered and unable to prevent the gypsies from storming the Gallery of Kings .
The gypsies are slaughtered by the king 's men , while Quasimodo ( who has not realised that the soldiers wish to hang Esmeralda ) runs to Esmeralda 's room .
He goes into a panic when she is nowhere to be found .
During the attack , Gringoire and a cloaked stranger slip into Notre Dame and find Esmeralda about to sneak out of the cathedral
( she had feared that soldiers were trying to take her away when she heard the battle ) .
When Gringoire offers to save the girl , she agrees and goes with the two men .
The three get into a nearby boat and paddle down the Seine , and she passes out when she hears many people chanting for her death .
When Esmeralda wakes , she finds that Gringoire is gone , and the stranger is Frollo .
Frollo once more gives Esmeralda a choice
: stay with him or be handed over to the soldiers .
The girl asks to be executed .
Angry , Frollo casts her into the arms of Gudule ( Paquette Guybertaut ) .
There , the two women realize that Esmeralda is in fact Gudule 's lost child .
The guards arrive , and Gudule pleads for them to show Esmeralda and herself mercy .
Gudule follows the guards to the scaffold , kicking and biting along the way .
A guard throws Gudule to the ground ; she hits her head and dies .
Back at Notre Dame , Quasimodo is still frantically looking for his friend .
He goes to the top of the north tower and finds Frollo there .
Quasimodo notes Frollo 's demented appearance and follows his gaze , where he sees Esmeralda in a white dress , dangling in her death throes from the scaffold .
