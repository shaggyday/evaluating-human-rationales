BACKGROUND TIMELY ERA Section::::Background .
Section::::Timely era .
During what is known as Marvel 's Timely era , Captain America was licensed out to Republic Pictures for a serial just for the free advertising .
Timely failed to provide any drawing of Captain America with his shield or any further background , and Republic created a whole new background for the character , and portrayed the character using a gun .
MARVEL ENTERTAINMENT GROUP ERA Section::::Marvel Entertainment Group era .
In the late 1970s up to the early 1990s , Marvel Entertainment Group ( MEG ) sold options to studios to produce films based on Marvel Comics characters .
One of Marvel 's superheroes , Spider - Man , was optioned in the late 1970s , and rights reverted to Marvel without a film having been produced within the allotted timeframe .
From 1986 to 1996 , most of Marvel 's major characters had been optioned , including the Fantastic Four , X - Men , Daredevil , Hulk , Silver Surfer , and Iron Man .
A Howard the Duck film made it to the screen in 1986 , but was a box - office flop .
MEG was purchased by New World Entertainment in November 1986 and moved to produce films based on the Marvel characters .
It released The Punisher ( 1989 ) before MEG was sold to Ronald Perelman 's Andrews Group .
Two other films were produced : Captain America ( 1990 ) released in the United Kingdom on screens and direct to video in the United States , and The Fantastic Four ( 1994 ) , not intended for release .
Marvel 's rival DC Comics , on the other hand , had success licensing its properties Superman and Batman into successful film franchises .
HISTORY
MARVEL FILMS Section::::History .
Section::::Marvel Films .
Following Marvel Entertainment Group 's ( MEG ) ToyBiz deal in 1993 , Avi Arad of ToyBiz was named President and CEO of Marvel Films division and of New World Family Filmworks , Inc. , a New World Entertainment subsidiary .
New World was MEG 's former parent corporation and later a fellow subsidiary of the Andrews Group .
Marvel Productions became New World Animation by 1993 as Marvel would start up Marvel Films including Marvel Films Animation .
Marvel Films Animation shared Tom Tataranowicz with New World Animation as head of development and production .
New World Animation ( The Incredible Hulk ) , Saban ( X - Men ) and Marvel Films Animation ( Spider - Man ) each produced a Marvel series for television for the 1996â€“1997 season .
It was Marvel Films Animation 's only production .
By the end of 1993 , Arad and 20th Century Fox struck a deal to make a film based on the X - Men .
New World Animation and Marvel Films Animation were sold along with the rest of New World by Andrews Group to News
Corporation / Fox as announced in August 1996 .
As part of the deal , Marvel licensed the rights to Captain America , Daredevil and Silver Surfer to be on Fox Kids Network and produced by Saban .
New World Animation continued producing a second season of The Incredible Hulk for UPN .
MARVEL STUDIOS Section::::Marvel Studios .
In August 1996 , Marvel created Marvel Studios , an incorporation of Marvel Films , due to the sale of New World Communications Group , Inc. , Marvel 's fellow Andrews Group subsidiary in film and television stations , to News Corporation / Fox .
Filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to raise money to finance the new corporation , Marvel , Isaac Perlmutter 's Zib , Inc. and Avi Arad sold Toy Biz stocks , which Marvel had started and took public in February 1995 .
Toy Biz filed an offering of 7.5 million shares with a closing price of $ 20.125 at the time , making the offering worth approximately $ 150 million .
Toy Biz sought to sell 1 million shares , and Marvel sought to sell 2.5 million shares .
Jerry Calabrese , the president of Marvel Entertainment Group and Avi Arad , head of Marvel Films and a director of Toy Biz , were assigned tandem control of Marvel Studios .
Under Calabrese and Arad , Marvel sought to control pre - production by commissioning scripts , hiring directors , and casting characters , providing the package to a major studio partner for filming and distribution .
Arad said of the goal for control , " When you get into business with a big studio , they are developing a hundred or 500 projects ; you get totally lost .
That is n't working for us .
We 're just not going to do it anymore .
Period .
"
Marvel Studios arranged a seven - year development deal with 20th Century Fox to cover markets in the United States and internationally .
In the following December , Marvel Entertainment Group went through a reorganization plan , including Marvel Studios as part of its strategic investment .
By 1997 , Marvel Studios was actively pursuing various film productions based on Marvel characters , including the eventual films X - Men ( 2000 ) , Daredevil ( 2003 ) , Elektra ( 2005 ) and Fantastic Four ( 2005 ) .
Unproduced projects included Prince Namor , based on the character Namor and to be directed by Philip Kaufman , and Mort the Dead Teenager , based on the comic book of the same name and written by John Payson and Mort creator Larry Hama .
Marvel was developing a Captain America animated series with Saban Entertainment for Fox Kids Network to premiere in fall 1998 .
However , due to the bankruptcy the series was canceled after only character designs and a one - minute promotional reel were made .
LICENSING FILMS
Section::::Licensing films .
The first film packaged and licensed by Marvel Studios was Blade , based on the vampire hunter Blade .
The film was directed by Stephen Norrington and starred Wesley Snipes as Blade .
It was released on August 21 , 1998 , grossing $ 70,087,718 in the United States and Canada and $ 131,183,530 worldwide .
In 1999 , Marvel licensed Spider - Man to Sony .
Blade was followed by X - Men , which was directed by Bryan Singer and was released on July 14 , 2000 .
X - Men grossed $ 157,299,717 in the United States and Canada and $ 296,250,053 worldwide .
Blade and X - Men demonstrated that widely popular films could be made out of comic book characters not familiar to the general public .
Leading up to X - Mens release , Marvel Studios negotiated a deal with then - functional Artisan Entertainment , successful with the low - budget
The Blair Witch Project , for a co - production joint venture that included rights to 15 Marvel characters including Captain America , Thor , Black Panther , Iron Fist , and Deadpool .
Artisan would finance and distribute while Marvel would develop licensing and merchandising tie - ins .
The resulting production library , which would also include TV series , direct - to - video films and internet projects , would be co - owned .
With the deal at the time , 24 Marvel properties were then in various stages of development .
Brian Cunningham , editor of Wizard comic book magazine , believed that Avi Arad was successful in organizing strategic alliances and exercising fiscal responsibility in multimedia expansion .
Cunningham said of Arad 's leadership of the studio following its parent company 's near - bankruptcy , " The fact the X - Men is primed to be the biggest movie of the summer speaks volumes about the turnaround for Marvel .
From my observation , he 's focused on a lot more in diversifying Marvel , doing things that proliferate Marvel characters in the mainstream . "
Arad sought to protect Marvel 's image by serving as executive producer in all Marvel film productions and being responsible for crossover marketing between Marvel properties .
Arad had properties set up at different studios to create momentum so one studio would not cannibalize efforts with one property for the sake of another .
By 2001 , the success of Marvel Entertainment 's Ultimate Marvel comics created leverage in Hollywood for Marvel Studios , pushing more properties into development .
The next film licensed from Marvel Studios was Spider - Man by Columbia Pictures , directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire as Spider - Man .
The film was released on May 3 , 2002 , grossing $ 403,706,375 in the United States and Canada and $ 821,708,551 worldwide .
The early success of Spider - Man led the film 's studio to issue a seven - figure advance for a sequel .
Arad spoke of the deal , " Movies make sequels .
Therefore , it 's a big economic luxury to know that a movie 's going to get a second and third .
This is a business of precedence . "
According to a Lehman Brothers analysis , the Studios made only $ 62 million for the first 2 Spider - Man movies .
Marvel was making more from half the consumer product licensing fees while making relatively little from the movie , but was enough for Marvel to regain its financial footings .
In October 2002 , Marvel Studios announced deals for Sub - Mariner and Prime with Universal Studios .
In producing Marvel films in the 2000s , Avi Arad sought to capture the superheroes ' internal conflicts .
According to The New York Times , " Mr. Arad 's great accomplishment â€“ and it is one , given the difficulties in transferring any kind of printed material to the big screen â€“ is conveying what makes those heroes tick as characters ...
He works with the filmmakers to ensure that the heroes are conflicted , the villains motivated , the outcome shaded . "
In contrast to the original storylines of DC Comics ' Superman and Batman films , Marvel films were more directly inspired by their comics , copying from them set pieces , scenes , plots , and dialogue .
In 2003 , David Maisel approached Arad about earning Marvel more for their films .
Maisel , Arad and Perlmutter met leading to Maisel being hired in as President and COO .
The studio 's office , then on Santa Monica Boulevard , were small with a dozen or so staff members .
Kevin Feige was a junior executive generating script notes to the licensed studios .
In January 2003 , Marvel , The SCI FI Channel and Reveille Productions agreed to develop two pilot films based on Brother Voodoo and .
Partnering with Lionsgate in 2004 , Marvel Studios plan to enter the direct - to - DVD market with eight animated films with Lionsgate Home Entertainment handling distribution .
The line was a proof of concept for Maisel 's later plan .
Eric Rollman was hired by Marvel as Executive Vice President , Home Entertainment & TV Production for Marvel Studios to oversee the deal with Lionsgate .
PRODUCTION Section::::Production .
In 2004 , David Maisel was hired as chief operating officer of Marvel Studios as he had a plan for the studio to self - finance movies .
Marvel entered into a non - recourse debt structure with Merrill Lynch that was collateralized by certain movie rights to a total of 10 characters from Marvel 's vast vault .
Marvel got $ 525 million to make a maximum of 10 movies based on the company 's properties over eight years , according to the parameters of the original deal .
Those characters were : Ant - Man , The Avengers , Black Panther , Captain America , Cloak & Dagger , Doctor Strange , Hawkeye , Nick Fury , Power Pack and Shang - Chi .
Ambac insured the movies would succeed or they would pay the interest payment on the debt and get the movie rights collateral .
Initially Marvel Studios was in talks with Universal Pictures as a possible distributor , as Universal owned the film rights to both Hulk and Namor during that time .
Negotiations dragged on , so the studio began talks with Paramount Pictures .
In the second quarter of 2005 , Merrill attempted to back out of full financing of each movie , demanding that Marvel finance 1/3 of the budget .
Marvel took back rights in five foreign territories from Paramount for pre - sell to meet that demand .
On September 6 , 2005 , Marvel announced the Merrill Lynch financing deal with Paramount was on as marketer and distributor .
Also , the parent company changed its name from Marvel Enterprises , Inc. to Marvel Entertainment , Inc. to reflect the change to self - production .
The studio moved to a new location over a Mercedes - Benz dealership in Beverly Hills .

Lions Gate Entertainment subsequently dropped the Black Widow motion picture project it had since 2004 giving the rights back to Marvel .
Maisel and Arad fought over the rate of movie releases and strength of characters in the movie line up .
Perlmutter supported Maisel and thus , in May 2006 , Arad quit as studio chair and CEO .
In March 2007 , David Maisel was named Chairman and Kevin Feige was named President of Production as Iron Man began filming .
In January 2008 , Marvel Animation was incorporated to direct Marvel 's efforts in animation and home entertainment markets including then animation efforts with Lionsgate and Nickelodeon .

Section::::Marvel Music .
Marvel Music is a subsidiary of Marvel Studios involved in the publishing of music related to its productions .
Mighty Marvel Music Corporation and Marvel Music Group , Inc.
( both incorporated on July 29 , 1981 ) were music publishing subsidiaries of Marvel Entertainment Group that were retained by New World Entertainment when Marvel was sold to Andrews Group in 1989 , and were with New World when they were sold to Fox .
Marvel Music was incorporated on September 9 , 2005 to manage Marvel Studios ' and Marvel Animation 's filmed music .
At New York Comic Con in 2009 , Marvel officially announced the re - launch of Marvel Music , which would now serve as a label for releasing music related to Marvel 's film and television productions .
Disney Music Group began distributing Marvel Music 's albums in 2011 with the soundtrack releases of Thor and , which were released under Buena Vista Records .
Beginning in 2012 , with the release of Avengers Assemble ( Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture ) , Disney 's Hollywood Records label began distributing Marvel Music 's albums from then onward .
In 2014 , Guardians of the Galaxy : Awesome Mix Vol .
1 became the first Marvel Music album to be certified Gold â€” and subsequently certified Platinum â€” by the Recording Industry Association of America , as well as the first soundtrack album in history to top the Billboard 200 chart , while consisting entirely of previously released songs .
LOGO Section::::Logo .
Starting with the release of Spider - Man in 2002 , Marvel Studios introduced its " flipbook " logo , created by Imaginary Forces .
This logo was accompanied with music from the film 's score , sound effects or a song , to lead into the beginning of the film .
This was the logo seen in front of all films until 2013 , when the logo was updated with the release of , again created by Imaginary Forces .
Kevin Feige stated that since Marvel was now their own entity within The Walt Disney Company , it " felt like the time to update it and have something that is more substantial as a standalone logo in front of our features " instead of having it be accompanied by Marvel 's studio or distribution partners ' logos .
Feige added that " We did n't want to re - invent the wheel [ with the new logo ] , but we wanted it to feel bigger , to feel more substantial , which is why it starts with the flip , but suddenly it 's more dimensional as we go through the lettering and it reveals itself with the metallic sheen before settling into the white - on - red , well known Marvel logo , with the added flourish of the arrival and the announcement of the Studios at the bottom of the word Marvel . "
Imaginary Forces used the same animation technique on the updated logo , as they did when they created the first version in 2002 .
They were given a few hundred comic books to select images from , ultimately choosing 120 that were " universal and not specific to one character " and created a narrative " where each image spoke to the one before it and after . "
The new logo appeared on all subsequent studio productions set within the Marvel Cinematic Universe through Captain America : Civil War .
With the addition of the new logo , Marvel Studios also added a fanfare to accompany the logo , composed by Brian Tyler , who wrote the scores to Iron Man 3 , Thor : The Dark World , and Avengers : Age of Ultron .
It was featured on the films Thor : The Dark World , , and Guardians of the Galaxy .
In July 2016 , another new logo and opening were introduced , featuring an updated fanfare , composed this time by Doctor Strange and composer Michael Giacchino .
The new opening begins with comic book panels seen in the previous two openings , but transitions into footage and art of the characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe films .
It was first seen in front of Doctor Strange .
The updated logo was created by Perception , who were first approached in January 2016 by Marvel to update their logo .
Feige specifically requested Perception " to combine the brand and the iconic characters into a single image , showcasing the heroes within the letterforms of the Marvel logo .
"
The Perception team settled on a concept they dubbed " How to Build a Universe " , which " was designed to pay tribute to [ the film making ] process by touching on " how a film 's origins is inspired by the comics , which then results in a script , followed by concept art , resulting in the final film .
Perception looked to the initial " flipbook " logo for inspiration , and paid tribute to it in the new opening , as it opens identically to the flipbook logo .
Next , the opening includes " various lines lifted directly from the script pages of various Marvel screenplays " , with Perception picking " both iconic fan - favorites , as well as lines that helped establish the breadth of the Marvel Universe . " To add in the concept art images , Perception looked " through a massive archive of concept art and " The Art Of â€¦ " books , to select the most iconic images for each beloved character .
Utilizing the original digital paintings themselves , the Perception team animated each image being painted from scratch .
The final touch was mapping this artwork onto 3D models to giving these once 2D paintings a sense of depth as the camera moves around them . "
Finally , over 70 pieces of footage from the 13 films that had released at that time were included , with Perception arranging them in a way they called the " vault " " where luminescent footage plays on the interior walls of the " Marvel " logotype . "
A new logo was introduced at the 2017 D23 Expo to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the MCU .
