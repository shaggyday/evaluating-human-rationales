VISA POLICY OF ANDORRA
The Andorran government imposes no visa requirements on its visitors and only requires a passport or European Union national identity card for entrance .
However , since the country is only accessible via the Schengen countries of Spain or France , entrance is not possible without entering the Schengen area first and the Schengen visa rules can therefore be regarded to apply de facto .
Because Andorra is not part of the Schengen area , a multiple entry visa is required to re - enter the Schengen area when leaving Andorra .
Foreign visitors looking to stay in Andorra more than 90 days require a residence permit .
There are no airports for fixed - wing aircraft within Andorra 's borders but there are , however , heliports in La Massana ( Cam√≠ Heliport ) , Arinsal and Escaldes - Engordany with commercial helicopter services .
