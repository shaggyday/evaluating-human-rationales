BLUE ICE ( AVIATION ) Blue ice , in the context of aviation , is frozen sewage material that has leaked mid - flight from commercial aircraft lavatory waste systems .
It is a mixture of human biowaste and liquid disinfectant that freezes at high altitude .
The name comes from the blue color of the disinfectant .
Airlines are not allowed to dump their waste tanks in mid - flight , and pilots have no mechanism by which to do so ; however , leaks sometimes do occur .
DANGER OF GROUND IMPACT Section::::Danger of ground impact .
There were at least 27 documented incidents of blue ice impacts in the United States between 1979 and 2003 .
These incidents typically happen under airport landing paths as the mass warms sufficiently to detach from the plane during its descent .
A rare incident of falling blue ice causing damage to the roof of a home was reported on October 20 , 2006 in Chino , California .
A similar incident was reported in Leicester , UK , in 2007 .
In 1971 , a chunk of ice from an aircraft tore a large hole in the roof of the Essex Street Chapel in Kensington , London , and was one trigger for the demolition of the building .

DANGER TO AIRCRAFT Section::::Danger to aircraft .
Blue ice can also be dangerous to the aircraft itself ; the National Transportation Safety Board has recorded three very similar incidents where waste from lavatories caused damage to the leaking aircraft .
All involved Boeing 727s , and in all cases waste from a leaking lavatory hit one of the engines , mounted at the rear of the aircraft , causing a power loss .
The flights made safe emergency landings with the two remaining engines .
Nobody was injured .
Only one report specifically mentions ice , while another mentions " soft body FOD " ( foreign object damage ) , indicating that the damage was caused by a relative soft object like ice or a bird and not a metallic object or a stone .
