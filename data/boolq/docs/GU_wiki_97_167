BARNEY STINSON Barnabas " Barney " Stinson is a fictional character portrayed by Neil Patrick Harris and created by Carter Bays and Craig Thomas for the CBS television series How I Met Your Mother .
One of the main characters , Barney is a womanizer who uses many ' plays ' in his ' playbook ' to help him have sex with women .
The character is known for his love of wearing expensive suits , laser tag , alcohol and various catchphrases , including " Suit up ! "
, " Legendary " , " Wait for
it " ( often combining the two as " legen — wait for it — dary ! " ) , and " Daddy 's home " .
In later seasons , he has a few serious relationships , marries , divorces , and has a child with an unnamed woman from a one - night stand .
Critics have praised the character and credit him for much of the show 's success .
He is considered the show 's breakout character .
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Development .
The show 's creators envisioned Barney as what Bays later described as a " large , John Belushi - type character " ; nonetheless , Megan Branman , the casting director for How I Met Your Mother , invited Harris to audition .
He assumed that he was invited solely because the two were friends and did not believe he had a chance of winning the role .
Harris later said : " Since I [ considered ] myself the long shot , I did n't care that much , and I think that allowed a freedom . "
His audition centered on a scene playing laser tag , and Harris attempted a dive roll , accidentally knocking over a chair and slamming into a wall in the process .
CBS executives enjoyed his playing and soon offered Harris the part .
The character is named for a heroin dealer in the James Ellroy novel L.A. Confidential .
CHARACTER Section::::Character .
Barney Stinson is one of five main characters on How I Met Your Mother .
He is a manipulative , oversexed businessman in his thirties who always wears a suit , likes women with " daddy issues " and is frequently willing to offer his ( sometimes hypocritical ) opinion .
Throughout the earlier seasons , Barney is a huge womanizer , and has been described as a " high - functioning sociopath " by his best friend , Ted Mosby ( Josh Radnor ) .
Barney has a plethora of strategies and rules designed to meet women , sleep with them , and discard them .
Through several seasons of the show , four ( 4 ) of the main characters are couples , as Ted began dating Robin Scherbatsky ( Cobie Smulders ) and Ted 's roommate Marshall Eriksen ( Jason Segel ) becomes engaged and later married to Lily Aldrin ( Alyson Hannigan ) .
This leaves Barney the only single character , and , according to Harris , Barney is " resentful " that the other characters have paired up .
Later on , in season 5 , he dates Robin .
They end up breaking up not long after , once they both realize they are making one another miserable .
Harris describes Barney as a man who " likes to create crazy situations and then sit back and watch it all go down . "
He is an opportunist who manipulates any situation so that it goes his way .
He is also highly competitive , and will take on " challenges " to complete outlandish tasks in order to prove his worth by often announcing " Challenge Accepted " .
He is proud and stubborn , and attempts to stand by his word no matter what .
In " I Heart NJ " , for example , he refuses to put down his fist unless someone offers him a fist bump .
By the end of the episode , he has the same fist elevated in a sling after struggling to keep his fist up throughout the episode .
In " Lucky Penny " , when the others do not believe that he can run the New York City Marathon the next day without training , Barney immediately agrees to do so .
Although he succeeds , he is unable to walk afterwards .
Although he thinks of himself as worldly , Barney is sometimes extremely naive , believing many lies his mother told him well into adulthood , such as believing that Bob Barker is his father .
Barney , like Harris himself , is an illusionist .
His favorite types of magic tricks involve fire , as seen in the tenth episode of the second season , " Single Stamina " and in the fourth episode of the fourth season , " Intervention " .
Barney uses magic tricks mostly to pick up women .
His most common method of picking up women is telling them elaborate lies about himself , often using an alias .
Many of his schemes for picking up women are in a book he has written called " The Playbook " , which is exposed in the episode " The Playbook " .
He has commitment issues , as evidenced in his reluctance to put a label on his relationship with Robin and the fact that she is one of the few women he has actually dated since the show started .
Barney is very well - connected and is the most affluent member of the group .
He frequently buys expensive items — such as a last - minute plane ticket to San Francisco , thousands of dollars in postage stamps , or two televisions specifically for smashing in frustration — in the spur of the moment .
He is also something of a metrosexual ; he waxes his chest , enjoys manicures and has an extensive knowledge of designer labels and gourmet food .
However , he is also seen to have a gambling problem that he occasionally gets under control , only to relapse as seen in several episodes such as " Atlantic City " , where he has gambling buddies in the Chinese Triad , and " Monday Night Football " .
Although The Early Show described him as " Utterly devoid of morality " , Barney lives by the " Bro Code " , his own code of ethics .
Despite his overall questionable character , according to creator Craig Thomas , Barney is " a pretty fragile character who 's really afraid of being alone .
He just wants people to like him , to be important to people , and to have disciples who follow his word .
" He has displayed a softer , kinder side on several occasions , however , such as preventing Marshall from sleeping with other women when he and Lily break up , and persuading Lily to come back to Marshall .
In " The Slutty Pumpkin Returns " , Barney finds out he is one quarter Canadian due to his Grandmother 's Canadian ancestory , much to his horror and embarrassment .
Throughout the series , one major character development is apparent in Barney : At the beginning of the show , his character is a womanizer who completely objectifies sex and women and wants nothing to do with dating and relationships .
Although he does date Robin in Season 5 , he resumes his promiscuous lifestyle immediately after they break up .
In Seasons 6 and 7 , however , he begins to confront his personal issues , like his relationship with his estranged father and his fear of commitment .
By the time late Season 7 rolls around , Barney has finally " grown up , " and has now warmed to the idea of a commitment and marriage , culminating in his proposal to his girlfriend , Quinn .
Although he briefly retreats to his escapades after he and Quinn break up , he does make one major final leap in his maturity when he burns The Playbook and proposes to Robin in Season 8 's two - part episode " The Final Page , " after finally admitting to himself that he is still in love with her .
Robin accepts and they plan their wedding in the second half of the season .
The final season revolves around Barney and Robin 's wedding weekend .
After some apprehension on both their parts , they get married in " The End of the Aisle " after he vows to always be honest with her .
The series finale , " Last Forever " , reveals that , three years after their wedding , they get divorced because Robin 's hectic travel schedule prevents them from spending any time together .
Barney returns to a lifestyle of meaningless sex with multiple women for several years afterward , until he gets one of his one - night stands pregnant .
He hates the idea of being a father until the day his child – a girl named Ellie – is born .
He falls in love with her at first sight and becomes a devoted father , turning away from his player lifestyle for good .
CHILDHOOD AND FAMILY Section::::Childhood and family .
A few references have been offered to identify Barney 's Birthday :
In " Natural History " , Barney claims he was six years old on July 23 , 1981 .
This puts his birthday somewhere between July 24 , 1974 and July 23 , 1975 ; in " Zoo or False " , Ted says Barney was born seven years after the moon landing ( which occurred in July 1969 ) , In " Columns " set in 2007 , Barney gives his age as 31 further confirming his birth year is 1976 .
In " The Drunk Train " Marshall states Barney is a Scorpio which places his birthday between October 23
- November 21 , 1976 .
He was raised in Port Richmond , Staten Island by his mother Loretta ( younger version voiced by Megan Mullally , played by Frances Conroy ) , who was apparently very promiscuous .
His father proved to be an ongoing mystery in the series .
When Barney was young , he asked his mother who his father was , and as The Price Is Right happened to be on TV at the time , she pointed to Bob Barker and replied , " Oh , I do n't know .
That guy .
"
Barney believed the lie wholeheartedly .
Years later , as portrayed in the season 2 episode " Showdown " , he appears on The Price Is Right with the intention of naming Barker as his father on national television , until he panics at the last minute and can not go through with it .
As a child , Barney was terrible at sports , and from various episodes it is shown he had few friends ( one scene shows that no one attended his birthday party ) .
In the episode " The Leap , " Lily reveals that Barney planned on being a violinist when he was young .
In " Natural History " , Barney finds out that a man named Jerome Whittaker , whom Barney believed to be his uncle , signed a form claiming to be Barney 's father .
Barney finally meets Jerome ( John Lithgow ) again in the episode " Legendaddy " and learns that he is in fact his father .
Upon meeting , Jerome feels pressured to act like the hard - partying womanizer he once was in order to impress Barney , and also because Barney refuses to see him any other way .
Barney eventually breaks down and accuses Jerome of walking out on him .
Jerome , who can offer no excuse , apologizes and pleads with Barney to allow him to be a part of his life .
Later in the sixth season , in " Hopeless " , Jerome tries to impress Barney by acting like his old self , but later reveals he was just pretending .
Barney , nevertheless , willingly listens to advice from Jerome about settling down .
Barney also learns of his Canadian heritage , when he finds out that Jerome 's mother was born in Manitoba .
Barney has three half - siblings : James ( played by Wayne Brady ) , from his mother 's side , a gay African American who is married to a man , with whom he has an adopted son and daughter ( as revealed in the season seven episode " The Rebound Girl " ) ; Carly ( played by Ashley Benson ) , a university student from his father 's side , whom Ted dates in the episode " Ring Up ! " , and Jerome Jr. ( JJ ) , from his father 's side , who is 11 .
He also has a female cousin named Leslie , with whom he accidentally grinds in a nightclub , as seen in the episode " Okay Awesome " .
EDUCATION Section::::Education .
Throughout the series Barney has claimed to have attended MIT ; In the final season , Barney explains that MIT is an acronym for the Magicians Institute of Teaneck , not the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
He has worn a Cornell Big Red T - shirt , indicating that he may have gone there , instead .
As evidenced in Season 2 " Atlantic City " , Barney learned at least conversational Korean , Chinese at some point , as well as some French .
His musical skills include playing the drums , dancing the tango and singing .
He is also skilled at juggling and laser tag .
ADULT LIFE PRIOR TO 2005
( " PILOT " ) Section::::Adult life prior to 2005 ( " Pilot " ) .
" Game Night " reveals that Barney had once been an innocent , idealistic young man who wanted to join the Peace Corps with his first serious girlfriend , Shannon .
When she left him for a suit - wearing womanizer , James arranged for the 23-year - old Barney to lose his virginity to their mother 's friend , Rhonda " the Man Maker " French .
After he slept with Rhonda and was led to believe he satisfied her , he became a similarly suit - wearing womanizer , even going so far as to adopt some of his rival 's catchphrases .
He lives by a strict code known as the Bro Code .
Barney is also revealed to have had a gambling problem , enabled by his mother , who is a bookmaker .
However , he assures the group that it is not a problem because he is so good at it .
He revealed in " Atlantic City " that he lost his entire life savings playing a Chinese game .
He has also apparently lost every one of his many bets on the Super Bowl .
He will go to any lengths to win a bet , even if it takes one year for just $ 10 .
IN THE SERIES ( 2005–2014 )
Section::::In
the series ( 2005–2014 ) .
While Barney 's softer , generous side is not often apparent , it is not always relegated to flashbacks .
When Marshall and Lily break their engagement in season one , Barney lures women away from Marshall so that he can remain faithful to the woman he truly loves .
It is revealed that it was Barney who convinced Lily to come back to New York , even buying her a plane ticket home .
Barney 's relationship with women evolves throughout the series ; in the later seasons , he begins to desire a more conventional relationship , as evidenced by his subsequent proposals to both Quinn Garvey and Robin Scherbatsky .
He is also known to write a blog .
In an allusion to Harris ' role in Doogie Howser , M.D. , the music played during his blogging sessions is the theme song from the show .
CAREER

In his blog , he writes that he is the Director of WHO DID THIS .

Barney states in " Cupcake " that , as a lawyer for Altrucell , Marshall would make more money in three months than he and Lily make in a year because his company has so many lawsuits against it .
In the season 3 episode " The Bracket , " he says that he is good enough at lying to avoid perjury charges .

In Season 4 , during the episode " Happily Ever After " , Barney states to a woman that he is an " Attorney in Law " , though this was probably just part of a pick - up line as he immediately followed it with " Let 's talk about getting you off " .

In a season 8 episode , it was implied that the full extent of Barney 's career might never be revealed .

APPEARANCES OUTSIDE
HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER Section::::Appearances outside
How I Met Your Mother .
In 2008 , the book The Bro Code , ostensibly written by Barney , was published .
Three other books ostensibly written by Barney , Bro on the Go ( 2009 ) , The Playbook ( 2010 ) , and Bro Code for Parents :
What to Expect When You 're Awesome ( 2012 ) , were also published .
In 2010 , Barney was featured in a Super Bowl commercial that showed him in the stands at the Super Bowl with a sign stating " Hey Ladies Call Barney Stinson 1 - 877 - 987 - 6401 . "
A recorded message by Neil Patrick Harris was played if the number was dialed .
CATCHPHRASES Section::::Catchphrases .
In the show 's pilot , Barney first utters the phrase , " Suit up ! " , as he tells others to dress like him to go out .
The phrase " Suit up ! "
came from an ad for a suit sale in a later episode about his past with Shannon .
According to creator Thomas , this is a sign that Barney " thought of his suit as some kind of superhero outfit that separated him from the pack .
" The phrase is repeated in many episodes , and is often modified to fit whatever clothing Barney is wearing , such as " Flight suit up " , "
Snow suit up " , and even " Birthday suit up " .
He also uses the word " awesome " to describe anything that he finds remotely pleasing , and invents different kinds of " high - fives " for every occasion .
However , Barney 's arguably most famous catch phrase is " Legendary ! " which he uses to describe anything and everything fun and exciting ( In fact , Ted says that he over - uses it ) .
When saying something is legendary , he typically says " it 's going to be Legen ... wait for it ... dary !
Legendary ! "
He also says " wait for it " quite often .
And also he often uses the word " Nice " to express when he enjoys something or someone .
In the show Barney frequently approaches attractive women with Ted in tow and asks " Haaaaaave you met Ted ? " as a way to start a conversation with strangers .
Thomas says that this phrase is based in real life , as a one - time friend of his often used a similar line to meet women .
He is also prone to saying " Daddy 's Home " as either a chat - up line or for grand entrances , and " True Story " as an ending to stories or theories that are generally erroneous .
Barney often uses the phrase " Challenge accepted " when someone mentions an outlandish task that supposedly can not be done ; he takes this as a personal challenge and attempts , usually successfully , to perform the task .
RECEPTION Section::::Reception .
According to The Early Show , Barney is one of the main reasons that the show has been a success .
Maclean 's stated that Barney is the show 's most popular character and explains that the most likeable characters are often those with the best catchphrases .
In 2006 , TV Land named Barney 's " Suit Up " one of the 100 Best Catchphrases .
Barney 's signature phrase is one of only four from contemporary television shows , as writers are now less likely to have a character repeat a phrase in many episodes .
In June 2010 , Entertainment Weekly named him one of the 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years .
Paste included him in their list of the 20 Best Characters of 2011 , ranking him No . 4 .
From 2007–10 , Harris was nominated for a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his work playing Barney .
In 2008 , Fireside published The Bro Code .
Ostensibly written by Stinson , although actually penned by Matt Kuhn , a writer for the show , the book reveals the code by which the character supposedly lives his life ( though he has been shown disregarding and/or violating a large portion of the articles in the book ) .
Oxford Dictionaries recognized Stinson as " the quintessence of a certain iteration of the contemporary bro " and noted how his language uses the word liberally .
