SIBLING - IN - LAW Sibling - in - law is a word phrase referring to the sibling of one 's spouse , or the spouse of one 's sibling , or ( more rarely ) taken one step further by referring to the spouse of one 's spouse 's sibling .
All of these are relations which do not relate to the person directly by blood .
Alternatively , the spouse of your spouse 's sibling may be called a co - sibling - in - law , or co - sibling .
More commonly this is referred to by the gendered terms : brother - in - law , or co - brother - in - law for a male non - blood sibling , and sister - in - law or co - sister - in - law for a female non - blood sibling .
Just like other affines , or " in - laws " , siblings - in - law are related by a type of kinship called affinity .
Just like the children of one 's siblings , the children of one 's siblings - in - law are called simply nieces and nephews – if necessary , specified whether " by marriage " , as opposed to " by blood " or " by adoption " .
One study , examining the issue of envy in the triadic system of sibling , sibling - in - law and spouse , concluded that " The sibling - in - law relationship shared similarities with both spousal and sibling relationships " and that " Relational closeness and satisfaction for all relationships in the triad were correlated . "
In Islamic law ( shariʿa ) and Jewish law ( halakhah ) sexual relations between siblings - in - law are prohibited as incestuous , unless the spouse is no longer married .
Conversely , in Judaism there was the custom of yibbum , whereby a man had a non - obligatory duty to we d his deceased brother 's childless widow
so she might have progeny by him .
If one pair of siblings is married to another pair of siblings , the siblings - in - law are thus doubly related , each of the four both through one 's spouse and through one 's sibling , while the children of the two couples are double cousins .
