LAKE
TAHOE Lake Tahoe
(;
Washo : dáʔaw ) is a large freshwater lake in the Sierra Nevada of the United States .
Lying at , it straddles the state line between California and Nevada , west of Carson City .
Lake Tahoe is the largest alpine lake in North America , and at trails only the five Great Lakes as the largest by volume in the United States .
Its depth is , making it the second deepest in the United States after Crater Lake in Oregon ( ) .
The lake was formed about two million years ago as part of the Lake Tahoe Basin , with the modern extent being shaped during the ice ages .
It is known for the clarity of its water and the panorama of surrounding mountains on all sides .
The area surrounding the lake is also referred to as Lake Tahoe , or simply Tahoe .
More than 75 % of the lake 's watershed is national forest land , comprising the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit of the United States Forest Service .
Lake Tahoe is a major tourist attraction in both Nevada and California .
It is home to winter sports , summer outdoor recreation , and scenery enjoyed throughout the year .
Snow and ski resorts are a significant part of the area 's economy and reputation .
The Nevada side also offers large casinos , with highways providing year - round access to the entire area .
GEOGRAPHY
Section::::Geography .
Lake Tahoe is the second deepest lake in the U.S. , with a maximum depth of , trailing Oregon 's Crater Lake at .
Tahoe is the 16th deepest lake in the world , and the fifth deepest in average depth .
It is about long and wide and has of shoreline and a surface area of .
The lake is so large that its surface is noticeably convex due to the curvature of the earth .
At lake level the opposing shorelines are below the horizon at its widest parts ; by nearly at its maximum width , and by some along its length .
Visibility may vary somewhat with atmospheric refraction ; when the air temperature is much greater than the lake temperature , looming may occur where the lake surface or opposing shoreline is lifted above the horizon .
Fata Morgana may be responsible for Tahoe Tessie sightings .
Approximately two - thirds of the shoreline is in California .
The south shore is dominated by the lake 's largest city , South Lake Tahoe , California , which adjoins the town of Stateline , Nevada , while Tahoe City , California , is located on the lake 's northwest shore .
Although highways run within sight of the lake shore for much of Tahoe 's perimeter , many important parts of the shoreline lie within state parks or are protected by the United States Forest Service .
The Lake Tahoe Watershed ( USGS Huc 18100200 ) of includes the land area that drains to the lake and the Lake Tahoe drainage divide traverses the same general area as the Tahoe Rim Trail .
Lake Tahoe is fed by 63 tributaries .
These drain an area about the same size as the lake and produce half its water , with the balance entering as rain or snow falling directly on it .
The Truckee River is the lake 's only outlet , flowing northeast through Reno , Nevada , into Pyramid Lake which has no outlet .
It accounts for one third of the water that leaves the lake , the rest evaporating from the lake 's vast surface .
The flow of the Truckee River and the height of the lake are controlled by the Lake Tahoe Dam at the outlet .
The natural rim is at above sea level , with a spillway at the dam controlling overflow .
The maximum legal limit , to which the lake can be allowed to rise in order to store water , is at .
Around New Year 1996/1997 a Pineapple Express atmospheric river melted snow and caused the lake and river to overflow , inundating Reno and surrounding areas .
NATURAL HISTORY GEOLOGY Section::::Natural history .
Section::::Geology .
The Lake Tahoe Basin was formed by vertical motion ( normal ) faulting .
Uplifted blocks created the Carson Range on the east and the main Sierra Nevada crest on the west .
Down - dropping and block tilting ( half - grabens ) created the Lake Tahoe Basin in between .
This kind of faulting is characteristic of the geology of the adjoining Great Basin to the east .
Lake Tahoe is the youngest of several extensional basins of the Walker Lane deformation zone that accommodates nearly per year of dextral shear between the Sierra Nevada - Great Valley Block and North America .
Three principal faults form the Lake Tahoe basin : the West Tahoe Fault , aligned between Meyers and Tahoe City , and which is the local segment of the Sierra Nevada Fault , extending on shore north and south of these localities ; the Stateline / North Tahoe Fault , starting in the middle of the lake and creating the relief that forms Stateline , NV ; and the Incline Village Fault , which runs parallel to the Stateline / North Tahoe Fault offshore and into Incline Village .
The West Tahoe Fault appears to be the most active and potentially hazardous fault in the basin .
A study in Fallen Leaf Lake , just south of Lake Tahoe , used seafloor mapping techniques to image evidence for paleoearthquakes on the West Tahoe and revealed the last earthquake occurred between 4,100 and 4,500 years ago .
Subsequent studies revealed submarine landslides in Fallen Leaf Lake and Lake Tahoe that are thought to have been triggered by earthquakes on the West Tahoe fault and the timing of these events suggests a recurrence interval of 3,000–4,000 years .
Some of the highest peaks of the Lake Tahoe Basin that formed during the process of Lake Tahoe creation are Freel Peak at , Monument Peak at , Pyramid Peak at ( in the Desolation Wilderness ) , and Mount Tallac at .
The north shore boasts three peaks at 10,000 + feet :
Mount Rose at , and Houghton and Relay peaks .
Mt. Rose is a very popular hiking and backcountry skiing destination .
Eruptions from the extinct volcano Mount Pluto formed a dam on the north side .
Melting snow filled the southern and lowest part of the basin to form the ancestral Lake Tahoe .
Rain and runoff added additional water .
The Sierra Nevada adjacent to Lake Tahoe were carved by scouring glaciers during the Ice Ages , which began a million or more years ago , and retreated
~15,000 years ago at the end of the Pleistocene .
The glaciers carved canyons that are today iconic landmarks such as Emerald Bay , Cascade Lake , and Fallen Leaf Lake , among others .
Lake Tahoe itself never held glaciers , but instead water is retained by damming Miocene volcanic deposits .
Soils of the basin come primarily from andesitic volcanic rocks and granodiorite , with minor areas of metamorphic rock .
Some of the valley bottoms and lower hill slopes are mantled with glacial moraines , or glacial outwash material derived from the parent rock .
Sandy soils , rock outcrops and rubble and stony colluvium account for over 70 % of the land area in the basin .
The basin soils ( in the < 2 mm fraction ) are generally 65–85 % sand ( 0.05–2.0 mm ) .
Given the great depth of Lake Tahoe , and the locations of the normal faults within the deepest portions of the lake , modeling suggests that earthquakes on these faults can trigger tsunamis .
Wave heights of these tsunamis are predicted to be on the order of in height , capable of traversing the lake in just a few minutes .
A massive collapse of the western edge of the basin that formed McKinney Bay around 50,000 years ago is thought to have generated a tsunami / seiche wave with a height approaching .
CLIMATE Section::::Climate .
Lake Tahoe has a dry - summer continental climate ( Dsb in the Köppen climate classification ) , featuring warm , dry summers and chilly winters with regular snowfall .
Mean annual precipitation ranges from over 55 inches ( 1440 mm ) for watersheds on the west side of the basin to about 26 inches ( 660 mm ) near the lake on the east side of the basin .
Most of the precipitation falls as snow between November and April , although rainstorms combined with rapid snowmelt account for the largest floods .
There is a pronounced annual runoff of snowmelt in late spring and early summer , the timing of which varies from year to year .
In some years , summertime monsoon storms from the Great Basin bring intense rainfall , especially to high elevations on the northeast side of the basin .
August is normally the warmest month at the Lake Tahoe Airport ( elevation ) with an average maximum of 78.7 ° F ( 25.9 ° C ) and an average minimum of 39.8 ° F ( 4.3 ° C ) .
January is the coolest month with an average maximum of 41.0 ° F ( 5.0 ° C ) and an average minimum of 15.1 ° F ( −9.4 ° C ) .
The all - time maximum of 99 ° F ( 37.2 ° C ) was recorded on July 22 , 1988 .
The all - time minimum of −16 ° F ( −26.7 ° C ) was recorded on December 9 , 1972 .
Temperatures exceed 90 ° F ( 32.2 ° C ) on an average of 2.0 days annually .
Minimum temperatures of 32 ° F ( 0 ° C ) or
lower occur on an average of 231.8 days annually , and minimum temperatures of 0 ° F ( −17.8 ° C ) or lower occur on an average of 7.6 days annually .
Freezing temperatures have occurred in every month of the year .
ECOLOGY Section::::Ecology .
Vegetation in the basin is dominated by a mixed conifer forest of Jeffrey pine ( Pinus jeffreyi ) , lodgepole pine ( P. contorta ) , white fir ( Abies concolor ) , and red fir ( A. magnifica ) .
The basin also contains significant areas of wet meadows and riparian areas , dry meadows , brush fields ( with Arctostaphylos and Ceanothus ) and rock outcrop areas , especially at higher elevations .
Ceanothus is capable of fixing nitrogen , but mountain alder ( Alnus tenuifolia ) , which grows along many of the basin 's streams , springs and seeps , fixes far greater quantities , and contributes measurably to nitrate - N concentrations in some small streams .
The beaches of Lake Tahoe are the only known habitat for the rare Lake Tahoe yellowcress ( Rorippa subumbellata ) , a plant which grows in the wet sand between low- and high - water marks .
Each autumn , from late September through mid - October , mature kokanee salmon ( Oncorhyncus nerka ) transform from silver - blue color to a fiery vermilion , and run up Taylor Creek , near South Lake Tahoe .
As spawning season approaches the fish acquire a humpback and protuberant jaw .
After spawning they die and their carcasses provide a feast for gatherings of mink ( Neovison vison ) , bears ( Ursus americanus ) , and bald eagles ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus ) .
The non - native salmon were transplanted from the North Pacific to Lake Tahoe in 1944 .
North American beaver ( Castor canadensis ) were re - introduced to the Tahoe Basin by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the U.S. Forest Service between 1934 and 1949 .
Descended from no more than nine individuals , 1987 beaver populations on the upper and lower Truckee River had reached a density of 0.72 colonies ( 3.5 beavers ) per kilometer .
At the present time beaver have been seen in Tahoe Keys , Taylor Creek , Meeks Creek at Meeks Bay on the western shore , and Kings Beach on the north shore , so the descendants of the original nine beavers have apparently migrated around most of Lake Tahoe .
Recently novel physical evidence has demonstrated that beaver were native to the Sierra until at least the mid - nineteenth century , via radiocarbon dating of buried beaver dam wood uncovered by deep channel incision in the Feather River watershed .
That report was supported by a summary of indirect evidence of beaver including reliable observer accounts of beaver in multiple watersheds from the northern to the southern Sierra Nevada , including its eastern slope .
A specific documented record of beaver living historically in Lake Tahoe 's North Canyon Creek watershed above Glenbrook
includes a description of Spooner Meadow
rancher Charles Fulstone hiring a caretaker to control the beaver population in the early 20th century .
A recent study of Taylor Creek showed that beaver dam removal decreased wetland habitat , increased stream flow , and increased total phosphorus pollutants entering Lake Tahoe – all factors which negatively impact the clarity of the lake 's water .
In addition , beaver dams located in Ward Creek , located on the west shore of Lake Tahoe , were also shown to decrease nutrients and sediments traveling downstream .
The lake 's cold temperatures and extreme depth can slow the decomposition rate of organic matter .
For example , a diver was found at a depth of 17 years after being lost , with his body preserved nearly perfectly .
HUMAN HISTORY NATIVE PEOPLE Section::::Human history .
Section::::Native people .
The area around Lake Tahoe was previously inhabited by the Washoe tribe of Native Americans .
Lake Tahoe was the center and heart of Washoe Indian territory , including the upper valleys of the Walker , Carson and Truckee Rivers .
The English name for Lake Tahoe derives from the Washo word " dá'aw , " meaning " The Lake . "
EXPLORATION AND NAMING Section::::Exploration and naming .
Lt .
John C. Frémont was the first person of European descent to see Lake Tahoe , during Fremont 's second exploratory expedition on February 14 , 1844 .
John Calhoun Johnson , Sierra explorer and founder of " Johnson 's Cutoff " ( now U.S. Route 50 ) named Fallen Leaf Lake after his Indian guide .
Johnson 's first job in the west was in the government service , carrying the mail on snowshoes from Placerville to Nevada City , during which time he named the lake " Lake Bigler " in honor of California 's third governor John Bigler .
In 1853 William Eddy , the surveyor general of California , identified the lake as Lake Bigler .
During the Civil War , Union advocates objected to the name , because Bigler was an ardent secessionist .
Due to this , the U.S. Department of the Interior introduced the name Tahoe in 1862 .
Both names were in use : the legislature passed legislation declaring the official name to be Lake Bigler in 1870 , while to most surveys and the general public it was known as Lake Tahoe .
The lake did n't receive its official and final designation as Lake Tahoe until 1945 .
MINING ERA
Section::::Mining era .
Upon discovery of gold in the South Fork of the American River in 1848 , thousands of gold seekers going west passed near the basin on their way to the gold fields .
European civilization first made its mark in the Lake Tahoe basin with the 1858 discovery of the Comstock Lode , a silver deposit just 15 miles ( 24 km ) to the east in Virginia City , Nevada .
From 1858 until about 1890 , logging in the basin supplied large timbers to shore up the underground workings of the Comstock mines .
The logging was so extensive that loggers cut down almost all of the native forest .
Lake Tahoe became a transportation hub for the surrounding area as mining and logging commenced prior to development of railroads .
The first mail delivery was via a sailboat which took a week to visit each of the lakeside communities .
The first steamboat on Lake Tahoe was the paddle wheel tugboat Governor Blasdel towing log rafts to a sawmill on the south side of Glenbrook Bay from 1863 until her boiler exploded in 1877 .
The Truckee and propeller - driven Emerald were also towing log rafts in 1870 .
J.A. Todman brought steam - powered passenger service to Lake Tahoe in 1872 with the 125-passenger side - wheel steamer Governor Stanford which reduced the mail delivery trip around Lake Tahoe to eight hours .
Todman expanded service with steamboats Mamie , Niagara , and Tod Goodwin .
Lawrence & Comstock provided competition with their steel - hulled steamboat Tallac in 1890 and later purchased Todman 's steamboats Mamie and Tod Goodwin .
The Carson and Tahoe Lumber and Fluming Company purchased the Niagara and built the iron - hulled steamboats Meteor in 1876 and Emerald ( II ) in 1887 .
The Meteor was the fastest boat on Lake Tahoe with a speed of per hour .
Lake Tahoe Railway and Transportation Company dominated the passenger and mail route after launch of their 200-passenger steamboat Tahoe on 24 June 1896 .
The 154-ton Tahoe was long with a slender beam so her engines could push her over the lake at 18.5 knots .
Lake Tahoe Railway and Transportation Company purchased Tallac and rebuilt her as Nevada with length increased by to serve as a backup steamboat when Tahoe required maintenance .
Tod Goodwin burned at Tallac , and most of the other steamboats were retired as the sawmills ran out of trees and people began traveling by automobile .
Niagara was scrapped at Tahoe City in 1900 .
Governor Stanford was beached at Glenbrook where its boiler was used until 1942 heating cottages at Glenbrook Inn and Ranch .
Steamboats continued to carry a mail clerk around Lake Tahoe until 1934 , when the mail contract was given to the motorboat Marian B powered by two Chevrolet engines .
Mail delivery moved ashore after Marian B was lost on 17 May 1941 with her owner and the mail clerk attempting mail delivery during a storm .
The Emerald ( II ) left Lake Tahoe in 1935 to become a fishing boat in San Diego .
Historic Tahoe , Nevada , and Meteor were purchased with hope they might be preserved ; but were scuttled in deep water after deterioration made preservation impractical .
The latter two lie in Glenbrook Bay , but Tahoe sank in deeper water .
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Development .
Even in the mining era , the potential of the basin as a tourist destination was recognized .
Tahoe City was founded in 1864 as a resort community for Virginia City .
Public appreciation of the Tahoe basin grew , and during the 1912 , 1913 and 1918 congressional sessions , congressmen tried unsuccessfully to designate the basin as a national park .
While Lake Tahoe is a natural lake , it is also used for water storage by the Truckee - Carson Irrigation District ( TCID ) .
The lake level is controlled by Lake Tahoe Dam built in 1913 at the lake 's only outlet , the Truckee River , at Tahoe City .
The high dam can increase the lake 's capacity by .
During the first half of the 20th century , development around the lake consisted of a few vacation homes .
The post - World War II population and building boom , followed by construction of gambling casinos in the Nevada part of the basin during the mid-1950s , and completion of the interstate highway links for the 1960 Winter Olympics held at Squaw Valley , resulted in a dramatic increase in development within the basin .
From 1960 to 1980 , the permanent residential population increased from about 10,000 to greater than 50,000 , and the summer population grew from about 10,000 to about 90,000 .
Since the 1980s , development has slowed due to controls on land use .
GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS INTERSTATE BOUNDARY DISPUTE Section::::Government and politics .
Section::::Interstate boundary dispute .
Lake Tahoe is divided by the prominent interstate boundary between California and Nevada , where the two states ' edges make their iconic directional turn near the middle of the lake .
This boundary has been disputed since the mid - nineteenth century .
As part of the compromise of 1850 , California was speedily admitted to the Union .
In doing so , congress approved the California Constitution which defined the state 's boundary in reference to geographical coordinates .
This includes the section of the 120th meridian that is between the 42nd parallel at the Oregon border to the 39th parallel amid Lake Tahoe , and an oblique line continuing from that point southward to where the Colorado River crosses the 35th parallel .
Fourteen years later , congress approved the Nevada Constitution when it was admitted as a state in 1864 , which defined its western border at the forty third degree of Longitude West from Washington D.C. and its southwestern border along the oblique section of the boundary line of California .
While 43 degrees of longitude west from the Washington Meridian does not really coincide with the 120 degrees longitude west of Greenwich , the 1864 Congress was of the belief that the two lines were identical ; the former was abandoned nationally in 1884 .
The centuries long dispute that erupted began with boundary discrepancies across many surveys within which were valuable mineral deposits ; Nevada also had a wish that California would assent to cede its land east of the pacific crest as had been preauthorized by congress in 1850 .
The first consequential attempt to mark the California - Nevada boundary was the 1863 J.F. Houghton and Butler Ives line .
A 1867 - 1868 survey of the California - Oregon border by Daniel G. Major for the General Land Office found the 120th meridian more than two miles west of the prior line , so it was followed by the 1872 survey by Allexey W. Von Schmidt .
Against initial instructions , Von Schmidt began his survey with the 1872 California - Nevada State Boundary Marker which was six - tenths of a mile east of the Houghton - Ives line .
When he discovered the Colorado River had shifted at the 35th parallel , he simply changed the endpoint resulting in a survey that was neither straight nor accurate .
Substantial doubts lead congress in 1892 to fund the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey to remark the oblique line .
This new survey found the Von Schmidt line to be 1,600 to 1,800 feet too far west , but both surveys were then used by both states .
Unsurprisingly , the combination of the 1893 C.G.S. survey 's oblique line and Schmidt 's well marked north - south line do not intersect precisely at the 39th parallel as mandated by the California Constitution .
Congress does not have the to unilaterally move state boundaries .
The wealth in natural resources between the Sierra Crest and the eastern - most sections of survey lines created a powerful source for conflict .
Major mining sites in the Tahoe area were in disputed territory .
In a striking display of opportunism which ostensibly occurred because the boundary was still " officially " unsurveyed , settlers arrogated parts of California up to the irregular Sierra Crest tens of miles east of the boundary — defined over six years prior — in an attempt to create Nataqua Territory .
An armed skirmish known as the Sagebrush War included gunshots exchanged between militia .
Even after six surveys , conflict remained over which of them , if any , were legally binding in marking the boundary ; this was partially heard by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1980 , where the doctrine of acquiescence was invoked .
A boundary defined in terms of geographical coordinates is theoretically precise , but poses pragmatic challenges to implement .
Where a particular coordinate actually lays on the surface of the earth is dependent on the figure of the Earth .
In the mid 1800s the Bessel ellipsoid of 1841 or the Clarke ellipsoid of 1866 were widely used ; the Hayford ellipsoid of 1910 may later have been used by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey .
The standard ellipsoid for western states in 1849—which is generally congruent with that year 's version of the Astronomical Almanac –
is implicit in California 's constitutional boundary definition ; incessant invention of new datums by new and potentially interested parties do not re - render the old boundary definition .
Holding assumptions of the earth back - in - time , modern satellite assisted survey techniques can determine location and transform them onto old ellipsoids to within a centimeter .
Celestial navigation techniques by contrast , are accurate up to two - fifths of a mile ; uncertainty in the latter was known , but precision then was unobtainable .
The legacy of this dispute continues .
There is an official federal obelisk - shaped monument marking the oblique California border , which is now surrounded by Edgewood Tahoe golf resort that is claimed and taxed by Nevada .
Disturbing survey monuments is illegal .
A federal survey monument was illegally removed to the Lake Tahoe Historical Society circa 2018 .
The Von Schmidt line crosses US 50 on the west edge of present - day Applebee 's , and the east edge of the Ashley Marcus Gallery in Tahoe Crescent V Shopping Center .
The Nevada community of Stateline has been moved east .
Google Maps shows the California border grazing through Harrah 's Casino .
Of the three interstate streets on the south shore , the border is only tepidly labeled on U.S. Route 50 in small font .
Created from land within the dispute zone , Van Sickle Bi - State Park opened in 2011 , but it is not a California State Park .
Unbeknownst to the negotiators , this compromise split Lake Tahoe : two - thirds for California , one - third for Nevada .
In California , Lake Tahoe is divided between Placer County and El Dorado County .
In Nevada , Lake Tahoe is divided among Washoe County , Douglas County and Carson City ( an independent city ) .
BEACH OWNERSHIP
Section::::Beach ownership .
As Lake Tahoe is a U.S. Navigable Waterway , under federal jurisdiction , the public is allowed to occupy any watercraft as close to any shore as the craft is navigable .
Public capacity to navigate across any land formerly inundated by the waterway is not extinguished by the lowering of the lake level ; this federal easement is maintained under United States law .
On the California side , the shorezone is additionally maintained in a public trust — analogous to an easement .
As public land , the shorezone on this side may be used for nearly any purpose , rather than just travel .
Neither state has the authority to rescind navigability along the shoreline below the highmark of the waterbody , because it has been granted under federal law through the Enumerated powers of the United States .
The entire waterbody is navigable ; it is common for the majority of users to be operating negligible draft one - person craft such as kayaks and standup paddleboards .
Like the interstate boundary itself , the high watermark has been disputed as well .
The theoretical maximum elevation of the lake is 6,229.1 feet , using the Lake Tahoe datum .
The yearly maximum is commonly lower ; this difference is less than the wave height on a calm day .
The state of Nevada has not agreed to either a highwater level or datum with California and the US , nor has this waterline been surveyed and marked in either state — making this interstate waterway boundary line somewhat arbitrary and disputed .
To be convicted of trespassing , one must be beyond reasonable doubt above the highwater mark , which itself is an arbitrary fact to be found .
The water held in the lake is federally controlled by the US Bureau of Reclamation , and immersion of the shoreline itself would be a common law trespass against east lakefront property owners if it were not for the land — below the theoretical maximum elevation of the lake — being in a perpetual federal easement .
Civic leaders for the Nevada shore have been pushing a frivolous states rights theory of property law — which intermittently nullifies federal easements whenever the lake level recedes — which has never been tested in federal court .
The sheriffs in Nevada are elected officials ; false arrest can lead to an officials imprisonment and cost their electorate hundreds of thousands of dollars .
Tahoe Regional Planning Agency does not have the authority to override existing federal law even if it was also created by congress .
Recent attempts by Lakefront Homeowners to use piers as " easement fences " to obstruct beach travel are encroaching centuries of established easement and admiralty law .
Building new piers on the California side additionally infringes on the public trust , which among many things , is purposed to preserve the land in its natural state .
GROWTH Section::::Growth .
As the population grew and development expanded in the 1960s , the question of protecting the lake became more imperative .
In 1969 , the U.S. Congress and the California and Nevada State Legislatures created a unique compact to share resources and responsibilities .
The Compact established the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency ( TRPA ) , a bi - state agency charged with environmental protection of the Basin through land - use regulation and planning .
In 1980 , the U.S. Congress amended the Compact with public law 96 - 551 .
The law designated a new agency , the Tahoe Transportation District ( TTD ) , to facilitate and implement Basin and regional transportation improvements / additions for the protection , restoration and use of the lake .
Schisms between both agencies and local residents have led to the formation of grass - roots organizations that hold to even stricter environmentalism .
HISTORICAL LOCATIONS Section::::Historical locations .
Lake Tahoe is also the location of several 19th and 20th century palatial homes of historical significance .
The Thunderbird Lodge built by George Whittel Jr once included nearly of the Nevada shoreline .
Vikingsholm was the original settlement on Emerald Bay and included an island teahouse and a 38-room home .
The Ehrman Mansion is a summer home built by a former Wells Fargo president in Sugar Pine Point and is now a state park .
The Pony Express had a route that went from Genoa Station over Daggett Pass to Friday 's Station and Yanks Station ; it succeeded the route through Woodford 's Station and Fountain Place Station both on the way to Strawberry Station .
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
WATER QUALITY
Section::::Environmental issues .
Section::::Water quality .
Despite land - use planning and export of treated sewage effluent from the basin , the lake is becoming increasingly eutrophic ( having an excessive richness of nutrients ) , with primary productivity increasing by more than 5 % annually , and clarity decreasing at an average rate of per year .
Until the early 1980s , nutrient - limitation studies showed that primary productivity in the lake was nitrogen - limited .
Now , after a half - century of accelerated nitrogen input ( much of it from direct atmospheric deposition ) , the lake is phosphorus - limited .
Theodore Swift et al . , concluded that " suspended inorganic sediments and phytoplanktonic algae both contribute significantly to the reduction in clarity , and that suspended particulate matter , rather than dissolved organic matter , are the dominant causes of clarity loss . "
The largest source of fine sediment particles to Lake Tahoe is urban stormwater runoff , comprising 72 percent of the total fine sediment particle load .
Recent research has shown that the urban uplands also provide the largest opportunity to reduce fine sediment particle and phosphorus contributions to the lake .
Historic clarity of approximately can be achieved with total reduction of approximately 75 percent from urban sources .
Historically , the clarity of Lake Tahoe continued to decrease through 2010 , when the average Secchi depth , , was the second lowest ever recorded ( the lowest was in 1997 ) .
This represented a decrease of from the previous year .
However , the lake 's clarity increased from 2011 to 2014 , improving by nearly 20 percent .
A water quality study by the Lahontan Water Quality Control Board and the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection determined the largest source of fine sediment particles : 71 percent is developed area ( urban ) erosion and run - off , much of it associated with transportation infrastructure and services .
Lake Tahoe is a tributary watershed drainage element within the Truckee River Basin , and its sole outlet is the Truckee River , which continues on to discharge to Pyramid Lake .
Because of the sensitivity of Truckee River water quality ( involving two protected species , the cui - ui sucker fish and the Lahontan cutthroat trout ) , this drainage basin has been studied extensively .
The primary investigations were stimulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , who funded the development of the DSSAM model to analyze water quality below Lake Tahoe .
Lake Tahoe never freezes .
Since 1970 , it has mixed to a depth of at least a total of six or seven times .
Dissolved oxygen is relatively high from top to bottom .
Analysis of the temperature records in Lake Tahoe has shown that the lake warmed ( between 1969 and 2002 ) at an average rate of per year .
The warming is caused primarily by increasing air temperatures , and secondarily by increasing downward long - wave radiation .
The warming trend is reducing the frequency of deep mixing in the lake , and may have important effects on water clarity and nutrient cycling .
ECOSYSTEM CHANGES Section::::Ecosystem changes .
Since the 1960s , the Lake 's food web and zooplankton populations have undergone major changes .
In 1963–65 , opossum shrimp ( Mysis diluviana ) were introduced to enhance the food supply for the introduced Kokanee salmon ( Oncorhynchus nerka ) .
The shrimp began feeding on the lake 's cladocerans ( Daphnia and Bosmina ) , and their populations virtually disappeared by 1971 .
The shrimp provide a food resource for salmon and trout , but also compete with juvenile fish for zooplankton .
Since the 1970s , the cladoceran populations have somewhat recovered , but not to former levels .
Since 2006 , goldfish have been observed in the lake , where they have grown to " giant size " , behaving like an invasive species .
They may have descended from former pets which owners dumped or escaped , when used as fishing bait .
In June 2007 , the Angora Fire burned approximately throughout the South Lake Tahoe area .
While the impact of ash on the lake 's ecosystem is predicted to be minimal , the impact of potential future erosion is not yet known .
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Section::::Environmental protection .
Until recently , construction on the banks of the Lake had been largely under the control of real estate developers .
Construction activities have resulted in a clouding of the lake 's blue waters .
Currently , the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency is regulating construction along the shoreline ( and has won two Federal Supreme Court battles over recent decisions ) .
These regulations are unpopular with many residents , especially those in the Tahoe Lakefront Homeowners Association .
The League to Save Lake Tahoe
( Keep Tahoe Blue ) has been an environmental watchdog in the Lake Tahoe Basin for 50 years .
Founded when a proposal to build a four - lane highway around the lake — with a bridge over the entrance to Emerald Bay — was proposed in 1957 , the League has opposed many development projects in the area , which it alleges were environmentally harmful .
The League embraces responsible and diversified use of the Lake 's resources while protecting and restoring its natural attributes .
Since 1980 , the Lake Tahoe Interagency Monitoring Program ( LTIMP ) has been measuring stream discharge and concentrations of nutrients and sediment in up to 10 tributary streams in the Lake Tahoe Basin , California - Nevada .
The objectives of the LTIMP are to acquire and disseminate the water quality information necessary to support science - based environmental planning and decision making in the basin .
The LTIMP is a cooperative program with support from 12 federal and state agencies with interests in the Tahoe Basin .
This data set , together with more recently acquired data on urban runoff water quality , is being used by the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board to develop a program ( mandated by the Clean Water Act ) to limit the flux of nutrients and fine sediment to the Lake .
UC Davis remains a primary steward of the lake .
The UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center is dedicated to research , education and public outreach , and to providing objective scientific information for restoration and sustainable use of the Lake Tahoe Basin .
Each year , it produces a well - publicized " State of the Lake " report , assessing changes such as lake clarity , nutrients and particles , or meteorology around the lake .
TOURIST ACTIVITIES Section::::Tourist activities .
Much of the area surrounding Lake Tahoe is devoted to the tourism industry and there are many restaurants , ski slopes , golf courses and casinos catering to visitors .
WINTER SPORTS
Section::::Winter sports .
