ISO WEEK DATE
The ISO week date system is effectively a leap week calendar system that is part of the ISO 8601 date and time standard issued by the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) since 1988 ( last revised in 2004 ) and , before that , it was defined in ISO ( R ) 2015 since 1971 .
It is used ( mainly ) in government and business for fiscal years , as well as in timekeeping .
This was previously known as " Industrial date coding " .
The system specifies a week year atop the Gregorian calendar by defining a notation for ordinal weeks of the year .
The Gregorian leap cycle , which has 97 leap days spread across 400 years , contains a whole number of weeks ( ) .
In every cycle there are 71 years with an additional 53rd week ( corresponding to the Gregorian years that contain 53 Thursdays ) .
An average year is exactly 52.1775 weeks long ;
months ( 1/12 year ) average at exactly 4.348125 weeks .
An ISO week - numbering year ( also called ISO year informally ) has 52 or 53 full weeks .
That is 364 or 371 days instead of the usual 365 or 366 days .
The extra week is sometimes referred to as a leap week , although ISO 8601 does not use this term .
Weeks start with Monday .
Each week 's year is the Gregorian year in which the Thursday falls .
The first week of the year , hence , always contains 4 January .
ISO week year numbering therefore slightly deviates from the Gregorian for some days close to 1 January .
A precise date is specified by the ISO week - numbering year in the format YYYY , a week number in the format ww prefixed by the letter ' W ' , and the weekday number , a digit d from 1 through 7 , beginning with Monday and ending with Sunday .
For example , the Gregorian date Sunday 31 December 2006 corresponds to the Sunday of the 52nd week of 2006 , and is written 2006-W52 - 7 ( in extended form ) or 2006W527 ( in compact form ) .
RELATION WITH THE GREGORIAN CALENDAR FIRST WEEK
Section::::First week .
The ISO 8601 definition for week 01 is the week with the Gregorian year 's first Thursday in it .
The following definitions based on properties of this week are mutually equivalent , since the ISO week starts with Monday :
*
It is the first week with a majority ( 4 or more ) of its days in January .
*
Its first day is the Monday nearest to 1 January .
*
It has 4 January in it .
Hence the earliest possible first week extends from Monday 29 December ( previous Gregorian year ) to Sunday 4 January , the latest possible first week extends from Monday 4 January to Sunday 10 January .
*
It has the year 's first working day in it , if Saturdays , Sundays and 1 January are not working days .
If 1 January is on a Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday or Thursday , it is in week 01 .
If 1 January is on a Friday , it is part of week 53 of the previous year .
If it is on a Saturday , it is part of the last week of the previous year which is numbered 52 in a common year and 53 in a leap year .
If it is on a Sunday , it is part of week 52 of the previous year .
LAST WEEK Section::::Last week .
The last week of the ISO week - numbering year , i.e. the 52nd or 53rd one , is the week before week 01 .
This week 's properties are : *
It has the year 's last Thursday in it .
*
It is the last week with a majority ( 4 or more ) of its days in December .
*
Its middle day , Thursday , falls in the ending year .
*
Its last day is the Sunday nearest to 31 December .
*
It has 28 December in it .
Hence the earliest possible last week extends from Monday 22 December to Sunday 28 December , the latest possible last week extends from Monday 28 December to Sunday 3 January .
If 31 December is on a Monday , Tuesday or Wednesday , it is in week 01 of the next year .
If it is on a Thursday , it is in week 53 of the year just ending ; if on a Friday it is in week 52 ( or 53 if the year just ending is a leap year ) ; if on a Saturday or Sunday , it is in week 52 of the year just ending .

WEEKS PER YEAR Section::::Weeks per year .
The long years , with 53 weeks in them , can be described by any of the following equivalent definitions : * any year starting on Thursday ( dominical letter D or DC ) and any leap year starting on Wednesday ( ED ) * any year ending on Thursday ( D , ED ) and any leap year ending on Friday ( DC ) * years in which 1 January and 31 December ( in common years ) or either ( in leap years ) are Thursdays
All other week - numbering years are short years and have 52 weeks .
The number of weeks in a given year is equal to the corresponding week number of 28 December , because it is the only date that is always in the last week of the year since it is a week before 4 January which is always in the first week of the year .
Using only the ordinal year number , the number of weeks in that year can be determined : The following 71 years , shown with light background , in a 400-year cycle have 53 weeks ( 371 days ) ; years not listed have 52 weeks ( 364 days ) ; add 2000 for current years : 004 009 015 020 026 !

On average , a year has 53 weeks every =
5.6338 … years , and these long ISO years are 43 times 6 years apart , 27 times 5 years apart , and once 7 years apart ( between years 296 and 303 ) .
The Gregorian years corresponding to these 71 long years can be subdivided as follows : * 27 Gregorian leap years , emphasized in the list above : * 14 starting on Thursday , hence ending on Friday , and
* 13 starting on Wednesday , hence ending on Thursday ;
* 44 Gregorian common years starting , hence also ending on Thursday .
The Gregorian years corresponding to the other 329 short ISO years ( neither starting nor ending with Thursday ) can also be subdivided as follows : * 70 are Gregorian leap years .
* 259 are Gregorian common years .
Thus , within a 400-year cycle : * 27 week years are 5 days longer than the month years ( 371 − 366 ) .
* 44 week years are 6 days longer than the month years ( 371 − 365 ) .
* 70 week years are 2 days shorter than the month years ( 364 − 366 ) .
* 259 week years are 1 day shorter than the month years ( 364 − 365 ) .
WEEKS PER MONTH Section::::Weeks per month .
The ISO standard does not define any association of weeks to months .
A date is either expressed with a month and day - of - the - month , or with a week and day - of - the - week , never a mix .
Weeks are a prominent entity in accounting where annual statistics benefit from regularity throughout the years .
Therefore , in practice usually a fixed length of 13 weeks per quarter is chosen which is then subdivided into 5 + 4 + 4 weeks , 4 + 5 + 4 weeks or 4 + 4 + 5 weeks .
The final quarter has 14 weeks in it when there are 53 weeks in the year .
When it is necessary to allocate a week to a single month , the rule for first week of the year might be applied , although ISO 8601 does not consider this case .
The resulting pattern would be irregular .
The only 4 months ( or 5 in a long year ) of 5 weeks would be those with at least 29 days starting on Thursday , those with at least 30 days starting on Wednesday , and those with 31 days starting on Tuesday .
DATES WITH FIXED WEEK NUMBER Section::::Dates with fixed week number .
For all years , 8 days have a fixed ISO week number ( between 01 and 08 ) in January and February .
And with the exception of leap years starting on Thursday , dates with fixed week numbers occur in all months of the year ( for 1 day of each ISO week 01 to 52 ) : + Overview of dates with a fixed week number in any year other than a leap year starting on Thursday !
Month!!colspan=5Dates!!Week numbers
During leap years starting on Thursday ( i.e. the 13 years numbered 004 , 032 , 060 , 088 , 128 , 156 , 184 , 224 , 252 , 280 , 320 , 348 , 376 in a 400-year cycle ) , the ISO week numbers are incremented by 1 from March to the rest of the year .
This last occurred in 1976 and 2004 and will not occur again before 2032 .
These exceptions are happening between years that are most often 28 years apart , or 40 years apart for 3 pairs of successive years : from year 088 to 128 , from year 184 to 224 , and from year 280 to 320 .
The day of the week for these days are related to Doomsday because for any year , the Doomsday is the day of the week that the last day of February falls on .
These dates are one day after the Doomsdays , except that in January and February of leap years the dates themselves are Doomsdays .
In leap years the week number is the rank number of its Doomsday .

Of these , the pairs 10/45 , 11/46 , 12/47 , 15/28 , 16/29 , 37/50 and 38/51 share their days also in leap years .
Leap years also have triplets 03/15/28 , 04/16/29
and pairs 06/32 , 07/33 , 08/34 .
The weeks 09 , 19–26 , 31 and 35 never share their days of the month with any other week of the same year . !

28 Months in the same row are corresponding months and
the dates with the same day letter fall on the same weekday .
All the D days are the dates with fixed week number .
When leap years start on Thursday , the ISO week numbers are incremented by 1 from March to the rest of the year .
For the current century letters in column A are domimical letters and years in row C are leap week years ( long years ) .
This table can be used to look up dominical letters ( DL ) , day letters ( dl ) , weekdays ( w ) , week numbers ( n ) , and the ISO week date ( WD ) .
Letters both in a century column ( A C E G ) and year rows ( c , y ) are dominical letters for years of the century .
Letters both in day columns and a month row ( d , m ) are day letters for days of the month .

For 1 October 2032 ( CD ) *
For 1980–W40–1 ADVANTAGES
* All weeks have exactly 7 days , i.e. there are no fractional weeks .
* Every week belongs to a single year , i.e. there are no ambiguous or double - assigned weeks .
*
The date directly tells the weekday .
* All week - numbering years start with a Monday and end with a Sunday .
* When used by itself without using the concept of month , all week - numbering years are the same except that some years have a week 53 at the end .
*
The weeks are the same as used with the Gregorian calendar .
DISADVANTAGES Section::::Disadvantages .
The year number of the ISO week very often differs from the Gregorian year number for dates close to 1 January .
For example , 29 December 2014 is ISO 2015-W01 - 1 , i.e. , it is in year 2015 instead of 2014 .
A programming bug confusing these two year numbers is probably the cause of some Android users of Twitter being unable to log in around midnight of 29 December 2014 UTC .
Solar astronomic phenomena , such as equinox and solstice , vary over a range of at least seven days .
This is because each equinox and solstice may occur any day of the week and hence on at least seven different ISO week dates .
For example , there are spring equinoxes on 2004-W12 - 7 and 2010-W11 - 7 .
The ISO week calendar relies on the Gregorian calendar , which it augments , to define the new year day ( Monday of week 01 ) .
As a result , extra weeks are spread across the 400-year cycle in a complex , seemingly random pattern .
There is no simple algorithm to determine whether a year has 53 weeks from its ordinal number alone .
Most calendar reform proposals using leap week calendars are simpler in this regard , although they may choose a different leap cycle .
Not all parts of the world consider the week to begin with Monday .
For example , in some Muslim countries , the normal work week begins on Saturday , while in Israel it begins on Sunday .
In the US and in most of Latin America , although the work week is usually defined to start on Monday , the week itself is often considered to start on Sunday .
CALCULATION
CALCULATING THE WEEK NUMBER OF A GIVEN DATE Section::::Calculation .
Section::::Calculating the week number of a given date .
The week number of any date can be calculated , given its ordinal date ( i.e. position within the year ) and its day of the week .
If the ordinal date is not known , it can be computed by any of several methods ; perhaps the most direct is a table such as the following . !

( y + floor ( ( y - 1)/4 )
+ 5 C - 1 ) mod 7 - 7 if the result
> 3 Method :
Using ISO weekday numbers ( running from 1 for Monday to 7 for Sunday ) , subtract the weekday from the ordinal date , then add 10 .
Divide the result by 7 .
Ignore the remainder ; the quotient equals the week number .
If the week number thus obtained equals 0 , it means that the given date belongs to the preceding ( week - based ) year .
If a week number of 53 is obtained , one must check that the date is not actually in week 1 of the following year .
Friday 26 September 2008
* Ordinal day : 244 + 26 = 270 *
Weekday :
Friday =
5
* 270 − 5 + 10
= 275 * 275 ÷ 7 = 39.28 …
* Result :
Week 39
The week date can also be given by for od and c look up the table above or use the algorithm to calculate .
There are 53 weeks in any year ( c = 3 ) or in leap years ( c = 2 ) , otherwise there are 52 weeks in a year .
Ceiling the quotient equals the week number and the remainder is the weekday number ( 0 = Sunday = 7 ) .
For 26 September 2008 the week date is 2008W395 .
CALCULATING
A DATE GIVEN THE YEAR , WEEK NUMBER AND WEEKDAY
Section::::Calculating a date given the year , week number and weekday .
This method requires that one know the weekday of 4 January of the year in question .
Add 3 to the number of this weekday , giving a correction to be used for dates within this year .
Method :
Multiply the week number by 7 , then add the weekday .
From this sum subtract the correction for the year .
The result is the ordinal date , which can be converted into a calendar date using the table in the preceding section .
If the ordinal date thus obtained is zero or negative , the date belongs to the previous calendar year ; if greater than the number of days in the year , to the following year .
Example : year 2008 , week 39 , Saturday ( day 6 )
* Correction for 2008 : 5 + 3 = 8 * ( 39 × 7 ) + 6 = 279 * 279 − 8 = 271
* Ordinal day 271 of a leap year is day 271 − 244 = 27
September
* Result : 27 September 2008
The ordinal date ( od ) can also be given by which can be converted into a calendar date , the day ( d ) of the month ( m ) , using the table above or by the algorithm below :
For example , as above : 2008W396 October -3 = September 27 ( 30 - 3 ) . OTHER WEEK NUMBERING SYSTEMS Section::::Other week numbering systems .
For an overview of week numbering systems see week number .
The US system has weeks from Sunday through Saturday , and partial weeks at the beginning and the end of the year , i.e. 53 or 54 weeks .
An advantage is that no separate year numbering like the ISO year is needed .
Correspondence of lexicographical order and chronological order is preserved ( just like with the ISO year - week - weekday numbering ) , but partial weeks make some computations of weekly statistics or payments inaccurate at end of December or beginning of January .
A variant of this US scheme groups the possible 1 to 6 days of December remaining in the last week of the Gregorian year within week 1 in January of the next Gregorian year , to make it a full week , bringing a system with accounting years having also 52 or 53 weeks and only the last 6 days of December may be counted as part of another year than the Gregorian year .
The US broadcast calendar counts the week containing 1 January as the first of the year , but otherwise works like ISO week numbering without partial weeks .
