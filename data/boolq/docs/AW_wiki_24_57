HISTORY EARLY YEARS Section::::History .
Section::::Early years .
Sydenham Airport was established by Shorts beside its Belfast factory at Sydenham in 1937 .
This became Belfast 's main civilian airport from 1938 to 1939 .
The airfield was requisitioned by the Royal Navy during the Second World War and named HMS Gadwall .
RAF Nutts Corner then became Belfast 's main airport ( while Aldergrove would later become the primary airport in Northern Ireland ) .
The Sydenham airfield continued to be used for military purposes until the 1970s , including use by the Fleet Air Arm as a naval aircraft storage unit , after which it was used solely by Shorts .
In 1983 , following interest from airlines and customers , the airfield was opened for commercial flights as Belfast Harbour Airport ( subsequently Belfast City Airport and now in its current guise ) .
DEVELOPMENT FROM 2000
TO 2010 Section::::Development from 2000 to 2010 .
Following major capital investment Bombardier sold the airport in 2003 for £ 35 million to the Spanish company Ferrovial , the owner of BAA Airports .
Ferrovial re - sold the airport in September 2008 for £ 132.5 million to ABN Amro Global Infrastructure Fund .
In March 2006 , it was announced that the airport would be renamed in memory of Northern Irish footballer George Best .
The new name , George Best Belfast City Airport , and signage were revealed at the renaming ceremony attended by Best 's family and friends on 22 May 2006 , which would have been Best 's 60th birthday .
The renaming of the airport caused controversy , with many articles in local and national print media highlighting the mixed feelings of Belfast residents .
Also in March 2006 Flybe announced that it would be naming its Belfast City – Manchester service after the footballer , dedicating a plane to him .
In October 2007 Ryanair established its 23rd base at the airport , operating five routes and carrying 800,000 annual passengers .
The airline closed its Belfast City base in 2010 due to delays in the planned runway extension .
The airline stated that would fly to European destinations from the airport if the runway was extended .
In January 2010 easyJet commenced flights to London Luton , though the airline moved the route back to Belfast International in 2011 .
Manx2 moved its Isle of Man service to the airport in 2010 , however the airline has since ceased operations .
Passenger numbers increased by 4.5 % from 2,621,763 in 2009 to 2,740,341 in 2010 , the highest total on record at the airport .
DEVELOPMENT SINCE 2011 Section::::Development since 2011 .

Icelandic carrier Air Iceland Connect commenced flights to Keflavik in 2017 on behalf of Icelandair , though the route was cancelled in 2018 .
EXPANSION PLANS AND OBJECTIONS Section::::Expansion plans and objections .
As the airport is adjacent to residential areas , the issue of noise pollution is a major one and a source of public debate .
The airport has developed a noise management strategy following a planning agreement , under which the airport operates , and has established operational noise abatement procedures .
The airport has recently applied for a complete removal of the limit on the seats it can sell – a key element of the 1997 planning agreement , which guards against over - expansion of an airport which is sited in a densely populated location .
As a result , numerous residents ' groups have formed a coalition –
The Coalition Against Belfast City Airport Expansion – to protest against the airport 's proposed expansion plans , and to represent the views of residents at the Examination in Public held during 2006 .
Restrictions applied to the airport
include : *
The requirement for flights to be scheduled between 6:30 am and 9:30 pm .
The exception to this is for delayed flights where extensions may be granted .
* That there would be a limit of 45,000 commercial ( and unlimited general aviation ) aircraft movements in any year , restricted further in 2008 to 48,000 combined commercial and general aviation aircraft movements .
*
That airlines must not offer more than 4 million seats for sale on flights from the airport per year .
* The majority of flights must approach and depart the airport over Belfast Lough ( currently 52 % as of April 2017 ) , rather than over the city of Belfast .
*
Any flight departing over the lough must turn left to head north ( further from land ) at 500 feet .
Only after reaching 2,000 feet ( for turboprops ) or 3,000 feet ( for jet aircraft ) may they then turn south to move over land again .
