CHAIN OF SURVIVAL
The chain of survival refers to a series of actions that , properly executed , reduce the mortality associated with cardiac arrest .
Like any chain , the chain of survival is only as strong as its weakest link .
The four interdependent links in the chain of survival are early access , early CPR , early defibrillation , and early advanced cardiac life support BACKGROUND Section::::Background .
The " chain of survival " metaphor was first published in the March 1981 newsletter of CPR for Citizens in Orlando , Florida .
It was further developed by Mary M. Newman of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation , and used as a slogan for the 1988 Conference on Citizen CPR , and described in an article she wrote for the Journal of Emergency Medical Services in 1989 , and in an editorial she wrote for the first issue of Currents in Emergency Cardiac Care in 1990 .
The American Heart Association adopted the concept and elaborated on it in its 1992 guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiac care , The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation ( ILCOR ) echoed the concept in 1997 .
EARLY ACCESS
Section::::Early access .
Ideally , someone must recognize an impending cardiac arrest or otherwise witness the cardiac arrest and activate the EMS system as early as possible with an immediate call to the emergency services .
Unfortunately , many persons experiencing symptoms ( for example , angina ) that may lead to a cardiac arrest ignore these warning symptoms or , recognizing these warning symptoms correctly , fail to activate the EMS system , preferring to contact relatives instead
( the elderly often contact their adult offspring rather than contact emergency services ) .
EARLY CPR Section::::Early CPR .
To be most effective , bystanders should provide CPR immediately after a patient collapses .
Properly performed CPR can keep the heart in a shockable ventricular fibrillation for 10â€“12 minutes longer .
EARLY DEFIBRILLATION
Section::::Early defibrillation .
Most adults who can be saved from cardiac arrest are in ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia .
Early defibrillation is the link in the chain most likely to improve survival .
Public access defibillation may be the key to improving survival rates in out - of - hospital cardiac arrest , but is of the greatest value when the other links in the chain do not fail .
EARLY ADVANCED CARE
Section::::Early advanced care .
Early advanced cardiac life support by paramedics is another critical link in the chain of survival .
In communities with survival rates > 20 % , a minimum of two of the rescuers are trained to the advanced level .
In some countries , EMS delivery may be performed by ambulance officers , paramedics , nurses , or doctors .
