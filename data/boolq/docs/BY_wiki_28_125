STATE INCOME TAX
Most individual U.S. states collect a state income tax in addition to federal income tax .
The two are separate entities .
Some local governments also impose an income tax , often based on state income tax calculations .
Forty - three states and many localities in the United States may impose an income tax on individuals .
Forty - seven states and many localities impose a tax on the income of corporations .
State income tax is imposed at a fixed or graduated rate on taxable income of individuals , corporations , and certain estates and trusts .
The rates vary by state .
Taxable income conforms closely to federal taxable income in most states , with limited modifications .
The states are prohibited from taxing income from federal bonds or other obligations .
Most do not tax Social Security benefits or interest income from obligations of that state .
Several states require different useful lives and methods be used by businesses in computing the deduction for depreciation .
Many states allow a standard deduction or some form of itemized deductions .
States allow a variety of tax credits in computing tax .
Each state administers its own tax system .
Many states also administer the tax return and collection process for localities within the state that impose income tax .
State income tax is allowed as a deduction in computing federal income tax , subject to limitations for individuals .
BASIC PRINCIPLES Section::::Basic principles .
State tax rules vary widely .
The tax rate may be fixed for all income levels and taxpayers of a certain type , or it may be graduated .
Tax rates may differ for individuals and corporations .
Most states conform to federal rules for determining : * gross income , * timing of recognition of income and deductions , * most aspects of business deductions , * characterization of business entities as either corporations , partnerships , or disregarded .
Gross income generally includes all income earned or received from whatever source , with exceptions .
The states are prohibited from taxing income from federal bonds or other obligations .
Most states also exempt income from bonds issued by that state or localities within the state , as well as some portion or all of Social Security benefits .
Many states provide tax exemption for certain other types of income , which varies widely by state .
The states imposing an income tax uniformly allow reduction of gross income for cost of goods sold , though the computation of this amount may be subject to some modifications .
Most states provide for modification of both business and non - business deductions .
All states taxing business income allow deduction for most business expenses .
Many require that depreciation deductions be computed in manners different from at least some of those permitted for federal income tax purposes .
For example , many states do not allow the additional first year depreciation deduction .
Most states tax capital gain and dividend income in the same manner as other investment income .
In this respect , individuals and corporations not resident in the state generally are not required to pay any income tax to that state with respect to such income .
Some states have alternative measures of tax .
These include analogs to the federal Alternative Minimum Tax in 14 states , as well as measures for corporations not based on income , such as capital stock taxes imposed by many states .
Income tax is self assessed , and individual and corporate taxpayers in all states imposing an income tax must file tax returns in each year their income exceeds certain amounts determined by each state .
Returns are also required by partnerships doing business in the state .
Many states require that a copy of the federal income tax return be attached to at least some types of state income tax returns .
The time for filing returns varies by state and type of return , but for individuals in many states is the same ( typically April 15 ) as the federal deadline .
Every state , including those with no income tax , has a state taxing authority with power to examine ( audit ) and adjust returns filed with it .
Most tax authorities have appeals procedures for audits , and all states permit taxpayers to go to court in disputes with the tax authorities .
Procedures and deadlines vary widely by state .
All states have a statute of limitations prohibiting the state from adjusting taxes beyond a certain period following filing returns .
All states have tax collection mechanisms .
States with an income tax require employers to withhold state income tax on wages earned within the state .
Some states have other withholding mechanisms , particularly with respect to partnerships .
Most states require taxpayers to make quarterly payments of tax not expected to be satisfied by withholding tax .
All states impose penalties for failing to file required tax returns and/or pay tax when due .
In addition , all states impose interest charges on late payments of tax , and generally also on additional taxes due upon adjustment by the taxing authority .
INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX Section::::Individual income tax .
Forty - three states impose a tax on the income of individuals , sometimes referred to as personal income tax .
State income tax rates vary widely from state to state .
The states imposing an income tax on individuals tax all taxable income ( as defined in the state ) of residents .
Such residents are allowed a credit for taxes paid to other states .
Most states tax income of nonresidents earned within the state .
Such income includes wages for services within the state as well as income from a business with operations in the state .
Where income is from multiple sources , formulary apportionment may be required for nonresidents .
Generally , wages are apportioned based on the ratio days worked in the state to total days worked .
All states that impose an individual income tax allow most business deductions .
However , many states impose different limits on certain deductions , especially depreciation of business assets .
Most of the states allow non - business deductions in a manner similar to federal rules .
Few allow a deduction for state income taxes , though some states allow a deduction for local income taxes .
Six of the states allow a full or partial deduction for federal income tax .
In addition , some states allow cities and/or counties to impose income taxes .
For example , most Ohio cities and towns impose an income tax on individuals and corporations .
By contrast , in New York , only New York City and Yonkers impose a municipal income tax .
STATES WITH
NO INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX Section::::States with no individual income tax .
Nine U.S. states do not level a broad - based individual income tax .
Some of these do tax certain forms of personal income : * Alaska – no individual tax but has a state corporate income tax .
Like New Hampshire , Alaska has no state sales tax , but unlike New Hampshire , Alaska allows local governments to collect their own sales taxes .
Alaska has an annual Permanent Fund Dividend , derived from oil revenues , for all citizens living in Alaska after one calendar year , except for some convicted of criminal offenses .
*
* Florida – no individual income tax but has a 5.5 % corporate income tax .
The state once had a tax on " intangible personal property " held on the first day of the year ( stocks , bonds , mutual funds , money market funds , etc . ) , but it was abolished at the start of 2007 .
* * Nevada – has no individual or corporate income tax .
Nevada gets most of its revenue from sales taxes and the gambling and mining industries .
*
* Tennessee has a " Hall income tax " of 6 % on income received from stocks and bonds not taxed ad valorem .
The Hall income tax is reduced to 5 % for tax year 2016 , with legislative intent that the tax be statutorily reduced by one percent annually beginning with the first annual session of the 110th general assembly and potentially eliminated by 2022 .
In 1932 , the Tennessee Supreme Court struck down a broad - based individual income tax that had passed the General Assembly , in the case of Evans v. McCabe .
However , a number of Attorneys General have recently opined that , if properly worded , a state income tax would be found constitutional by today 's court , due to a 1971 constitutional amendment .
* * Texas – no individual income tax , but imposes a franchise tax on corporations .
In May 2007 , the legislature modified the franchise tax by enacting a modified gross margin tax on certain businesses ( sole proprietorships and some partnerships were automatically exempt ; corporations with receipts below a certain level were also exempt as were corporations whose tax liability was also below a specified amount ) , which was amended in 2009 to increase the exemption level .
The Texas Constitution places severe restrictions on passage of an individual income tax and the use of its proceeds .
*
* Washington – no individual tax but has a business and occupation tax ( B&O ) on gross receipts , applied to " almost all businesses located or doing business in Washington .
" It varies from 0.138 % to 1.9 % depending on the type of industry .
*
* Wyoming has no individual or corporate income taxes .
* * South Dakota – no individual income tax but has a state corporate income tax on financial institutions .
*
* New Hampshire – has an Interest and Dividends Tax of 5 % , and a Business Profits Tax of 8.5 % .
A Gambling Winnings Tax of 10 % went into effect July 1 , 2009 and was repealed May 11 , 2011 .
New Hampshire has no sales tax .
* STATES WITH FLAT RATE INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX Section::::States with flat rate individual income tax .

* Colorado – 4.63 % ( 2016 )
* Illinois – 4.95 % ( July 2017 )

West Virginia :
* Some municipalities , including Charleston and Huntington ( flat City Service fee for privilege of working or conducting business ; filed with municipality imposing fee ) CORPORATE INCOME TAX Section::::Corporate income tax .
Most states impose a tax on income of corporations having sufficient connection ( " nexus " ) with the state .
Such taxes apply to U.S. and foreign corporations , and are not subject to tax treaties .
Such tax is generally based on business income of the corporation apportioned to the state plus nonbusiness income only of resident corporations .
Most state corporate income taxes are imposed at a flat rate and have a minimum amount of tax .
Business taxable income in most states is defined , at least in part , by reference to federal taxable income .
According to www.taxfoundation.org these states have no state corporate income tax as of Feb 1 , 2010 : Nevada , Washington , Wyoming , Texas , and South Dakota .
However , Texas has a franchise tax based on " taxable margin " , generally defined as sales less either cost of goods sold less compensation , with complete exemption ( no tax owed ) for less than $ 1MM in annual earnings and gradually increasing to a maximum tax of 1 % based on net revenue , where net revenue can be calculated in the most advantageous of four different ways .
NEXUS Section::::Nexus .
States are not permitted to tax income of a corporation unless four tests are met under Complete Auto Transit , Inc. v. Brady : Substantial nexus ( referred to generally as simply " nexus " )
is a general U.S. Constitutional requirement that is subject to interpretation , generally by the state 's comptroller or tax office , and often in administrative " letter rulings " .
In Quill Corp. v. North Dakota
the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the holding of National Bellas Hess v. Illinois that a corporation or other tax entity must maintain a physical presence in the state ( such as physical property , employees , officers ) for the state to be able to require it to collect sales or use tax .
The Supreme Court 's physical presence requirement in Quill is likely limited to sales and use tax nexus , but the Court specifically stated that it was silent with respect to all other types of taxes ( " Although we have not , in our review of other types of taxes , articulated the same physical - presence requirement that Bellas Hess established for sales and use taxes , that silence does not imply repudiation of the Bellas Hess rule . " ) .
Whether Quill applies to corporate income and similar taxes is a point of contention between states and taxpayers .
The " substantial nexus " requirement of Complete Auto , supra , has been applied to corporate income tax by numerous state supreme courts .
APPORTIONMENT Section::::Apportionment .
The courts have held that the requirement for fair apportionment may be met by apportioning between jurisdictions all business income of a corporation based on a formula using the particular corporation 's details .
Many states use a three factor formula , averaging the ratios of property , payroll , and sales within the state to that overall .
Some states weight the formula .
Some states use a single factor formula based on sales .
NONBUSINESS INCOME
Section::::Nonbusiness income .
Some states tax resident corporations on nonbusiness income regardless of apportionment .
Generally , a resident corporation is one incorporated in that state .
The definition of nonbusiness income varies but generally includes investment income of business corporations , including dividends .
CONSOLIDATED OR UNITARY
FILINGS
Section::::Consolidated or unitary filings .
Some states require and some states permit parent / subsidiary controlled groups of corporations to file returns on a consolidated or combined basis .
California and Illinois require that all U.S. members of a " unitary " group must file a combined return .
RETURNS
Section::::Returns .
State corporate income tax returns vary highly in complexity from two pages to more than 20 pages .
States often require that a copy of the federal income tax return be attached to the state return .
Corporate income tax return
due dates may differ from individual tax return due dates .
Most states grant extensions of time to file corporate tax returns .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Some of the English colonies in North America taxed property ( mostly farmland at that time ) according to its assessed produce , rather than , as now , according to assessed resale value .
Some of these colonies also taxed " faculties " of making income in ways other than farming , assessed by the same people who assessed property .
These taxes taken together can be considered a sort of income tax .
The records of no colony covered by Rabushka ( the colonies that became part of the United States ) separated the property and faculty components , and most records indicate amounts levied rather than collected , so much is unknown about the effectiveness of these taxes , up to and including whether the faculty part was actually collected at all .
* Plymouth Colony from 1643 and Massachusetts Bay Colony from 1646 , and after they merged , the Province of Massachusetts Bay until the Revolution ; * New Haven Colony from 1649 and Connecticut Colony from 1650 , past the 1662 merger with New Haven , until the Revolution ; * the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , arguably from 1673 to 1744 or later ; * the Province of West Jersey , a single 1684 law ; * the " South - west part " of the Province of Carolina , later the Province of South Carolina , from 1701 until the Revolution ; * the Province of New Hampshire , arguably from 1719 to 1772 or later ; * and the Delaware Colony in the Province of Pennsylvania , from 1752 to the Revolution .
Rabushka makes it clear that Massachusetts and Connecticut actually levied these taxes regularly , while for the other colonies such levies happened much less often ; South Carolina levied no direct taxes from 1704 through 1713 , for example .
Becker , however , sees faculty taxes as routine parts of several colonies ' finances , including Pennsylvania .
During and after the American Revolution , although property taxes were evolving toward the modern resale - value model , several states continued to collect faculty taxes .
* Massachusetts until 1916 ( when it was replaced by a quasi - modern classified individual income tax ) ;
* Connecticut until 1819 ; * South Carolina , where the tax edged closer to a modern income tax , until 1868 ; * Delaware until 1796 ; * Maryland from 1777 to 1780 ; * Virginia from 1777 to 1782 ; * New York ,
one 1778 levy ; * the Vermont Republic , then Vermont as a state , from 1778 to 1850 ; * and Pennsylvania from 1782 to 1840 ( when it was replaced by an individual income tax ; Becker , as noted above , would date this tax earlier ) .
Between the enactment of the Constitution and 1840 , no new general taxes on income appeared .
In 1796 , Delaware abolished its faculty tax , and in 1819 Connecticut followed suit .
On the other hand , in 1835 , Pennsylvania instituted a tax on bank dividends , paid by withholding , which by about 1900 produced half its total revenue .
Several states , mostly in the South , instituted taxes related to income in the 1840s ; some of these claimed to tax total income , while others explicitly taxed only specific categories , these latter sometimes called classified income taxes .
These taxes may have been spurred by the ideals of Jacksonian democracy , or by fiscal difficulties resulting from the Panic of 1837 .
None of these taxes produced much revenue , partly because they were collected by local elected officials .
A list : * Pennsylvania from 1840 to 1871 ; * Maryland from 1841 to 1850 ; * Alabama from 1843 to 1884 ; * Virginia from 1843 to 1926 ( when it was replaced by a modern individual income tax ) ; * Florida from 1845 to 1855 ; * and North Carolina from 1849 to 1921 ( when it was replaced by a modern individual income tax ) .
The 1850s brought another few income tax abolitions : Maryland and Vermont in 1850 , and Florida in 1855 .
During the American Civil War and Reconstruction Era , when both the United States of America ( 1861 - 1871 ) and the Confederate States of America ( 1863 - 1865 ) instituted income taxes , so did several states .
* Texas from 1863 to 1871 ; * Missouri from 1861 to 1865 ; * Georgia from 1863 to 1866 ; * West Virginia in 1863 only ;
* Louisiana from 1865 to 1899 ; * and Kentucky from 1867 to 1872 .
As with the national taxes , these were made in various ways to produce substantial revenue , for the first time in the history of American income taxation .
On the other hand , as soon as the war ended , a wave of abolitions began : Missouri in 1865 , Georgia in 1866 , South Carolina in 1868 , Pennsylvania and Texas in 1871 , and Kentucky in 1872 .
The rest of the century balanced new taxes with abolitions : Delaware levied a tax on several classes of income in 1869 , then abolished it in 1871 ; Tennessee instituted a tax on dividends and bond interest in 1883 , but Kinsman reports that by 1903 it had produced zero actual revenue ; Alabama abolished its income tax in 1884 ; South Carolina instituted a new one in 1897 ( eventually abolished in 1918 ) ; and Louisiana abolished its income tax in 1899 .
Following the 1895 Supreme Court decision in Pollock v. Farmers ' Loan & Trust Co. which effectively ended a federal income tax , some more states instituted their own along the lines established in the 19th century : * Oklahoma 1908 to 1915 ; * Mississippi 1912 to 1924 ; * Missouri , individual and corporate , from 1917 .
However , other states , some perhaps spurred by Populism , some certainly by Progressivism , instituted taxes incorporating various measures long used in Europe , but considerably less common in America , such as withholding , corporate income taxation ( as against earlier taxes on corporate capital ) , and especially the defining feature of a " modern " income tax , central administration by bureaucrats rather than local elected officials .
The twin revenue - raising successes of Wisconsin 's 1911 and the United States ' 1914 income taxes prompted imitation .
Note that writers on the subject sometimes distinguish between corporate " net income " taxes , which are straightforward corporate income taxes , and corporate " franchise " taxes , which are taxes levied on corporations for doing business in a state , sometimes based on net income .
Many states ' constitutions were interpreted as barring direct income taxation , and franchise taxes were seen as legal ways to evade these bars .
The term " franchise tax " has nothing to do with the voting franchise , and franchise taxes only apply to individuals insofar as they do business .
Note that some states actually levy both corporate net income taxes and corporate franchise taxes based on net income .
For the following list see * The Territory of Hawaii , then Hawaii as a state , individual and corporate from 1901 ( this is sometimes claimed as the oldest state income tax ; it is certainly the oldest state corporate income tax ) ;
* Wisconsin , individual and corporate from 1911 ( generally considered the first modern state income tax , built on a law largely written by Delos Kinsman , whose 1903 book on the subject is cited above ; its major distinction as against older laws , including Hawaii 's , is that state bureaucrats rather than local assessors collected it ) ;
* Connecticut , franchise , from 1915 ; * Oklahoma , modernisation of existing individual tax , from 1915 ; * Massachusetts , individual , from 1916 ; * Virginia , corporate , from 1916 ; * Delaware , individual , from 1917 ; * Montana , franchise , from 1917 ; * New York , franchise , from 1917 ;
* Note abolition of South Carolina 's non - modern individual income tax in 1918 ; * Alabama , individual , 1919 , declared unconstitutional 1920 ; * New Mexico , individual and corporate , 1919 , apparently abolished soon thereafter ; * New York , individual , from 1919 ; * North Dakota , individual and corporate , from 1919 ; * Massachusetts , corporate ( franchise ) , from 1919 or 1920 ; * Mississippi 's income tax was held to apply to corporations in 1921 ; * North Carolina , modernisation of existing individual and institution of corporate taxes , from 1921 ; * South Carolina , individual and corporate , from 1921 or 1922 ;
* New Hampshire , " intangibles " ( restricted to interest and dividends ) , from 1923 ; * Oregon , individual and corporate , 1923 ( repealed 1924 ) ; * Tennessee , corporate , from 1923 ; * Mississippi , modernisation of existing corporate and individual taxes , from 1924 ; * Virginia , modernisation of existing corporate and individual taxes , from 1926 .
This period coincided with the United States ' acquisition of colonies , or dependencies : the Philippines , Puerto Rico , and Guam from Spain in the Spanish – American War , 1898–99 ; American Samoa by agreements with local leaders , 1899 - 1904 ; the Panama Canal Zone by agreement from Panama in 1904 ; and the U.S. Virgin Islands purchased from Denmark in 1917 .
( Arguably , Alaska , purchased from Russia in 1867 , and Hawaii , annexed in 1900 , were also dependencies , but both were by 1903 " incorporated " in the U.S. , which these others never have been . )
The Panama Canal Zone was essentially a company town , but the others all began levying income taxes under American rule .
( Puerto Rico already had an income tax much like a faculty tax , which remained in effect for a short time after 1898 . )
* The Philippines and Puerto Rico , from 1913 , by the same law that instituted the federal income tax ; this law is ancestral to the modern independent Philippines ' income tax as well ; and * The U.S. Virgin Islands , from 1922 .
A third of the current state individual income taxes , and still more of the current state corporate income taxes , were instituted during the decade after the Great Depression started : * Arkansas , individual and corporate , from 1929 ; * California , franchise , from 1929 ; * Georgia , individual and corporate , from 1929 ; * Oregon , individual , franchise , and intangibles , from 1929 , but the individual tax did n't take effect until 1930 and was restricted to use for property tax relief , and the intangibles tax was held unconstitutional in 1930 ; * Tennessee , intangibles , from 1929 ; * Idaho , individual and corporate , from 1931 ; * Ohio , intangibles , from 1931 , apparently abolished soon thereafter ; * Oklahoma , corporate , from 1931 ; * Oregon , intangibles , 1931 to 1939 ; * Utah , individual and franchise , from 1931 ; * Vermont , individual and corporate , from 1931 ; * Illinois , individual and corporate , 1932 , soon declared unconstitutional ;
* Washington , individual and corporate , 1932 , declared unconstitutional 1933 ; * Alabama , individual and corporate , from 1933 ; * Arizona , individual and corporate , from 1933 ; * Kansas , individual and corporate , from 1933 ; * Minnesota , individual , corporate , and franchise , from 1933 ; * Montana , individual and corporate , from 1933 ; * New Mexico , individual and corporate , from 1933 ; * Iowa , individual and franchise , from 1934 ; * Louisiana , individual and corporate , from 1934 ; * California , individual and corporate , from 1935 ; * Pennsylvania , franchise , from 1935 ; * South Dakota , individual and corporate , 1935 to 1943 ; * The U.S. Virgin Islands income tax in 1935 became the first " mirror " tax , for which see below ; * Washington , individual and corporate , 1935 , held unconstitutional in separate decisions the same year ; * West Virginia , individual , 1935 to 1942 ; * Kentucky , individual and corporate , from 1936 ; * Colorado , individual and corporate , from 1937 ; * Maryland , individual and corporate , from 1937 ; * District of Columbia , individual and either corporate or franchise , from 1939 .
A " mirror " tax is a tax in a U.S. dependency in which the dependency adopts wholesale the U.S. federal income tax code , revising it by substituting the dependency 's name for " United States " everywhere , and vice versa .
The effect is that residents pay the equivalent of the federal income tax to the dependency , rather than to the U.S. government .
Although mirroring formally came to an end with the Tax Reform Act of 1986 , it remains the law as seen by the U.S. for Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands because conditions to its termination have not yet been met .
In any event , the other mirror tax dependencies ( the U.S. Virgin Islands and American Samoa ) are free to continue mirroring if , and as much as , they wish .
The U.S. acquired one more dependency from Japan in World War II : the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands .
Two states , South Dakota and West Virginia , abolished Depression - era income taxes in 1942 and 1943 , but these were nearly the last abolitions .
For about twenty years after World War II , new state income taxes appeared at a somewhat slower pace , and most were corporate net income or corporate franchise taxes : * Rhode Island , corporate , from 1947 ; * The Territory of Alaska , then Alaska as a state , individual and corporate , from 1949 ; * Guam , mirror , from 1950 ; * Pennsylvania , corporate , from 1951 ;
* Oregon removed the restriction of individual income tax funds to property tax relief in 1953 ; * Delaware , corporate , from 1958 ; * New Jersey , corporate , from 1958 ; * Idaho , franchise , from 1959 ; * Utah , corporate , from 1959 ; * West Virginia , individual , from 1961 ; * American Samoa , mirror , from 1963 ; * Indiana , individual and corporate , from 1963 ; * Wisconsin , franchise , from 1965 .
As early as 1957 General Motors protested a proposed corporate income tax in Michigan with threats of moving manufacturing out of the state .
However , Michigan led off the most recent group of new income taxes : * Michigan , individual and corporate ( this replacing a value - added tax ) , from 1967 ; * Nebraska , individual and corporate , from 1967 ; * Maryland , individual ( added county withholding tax and non resident tax .
Believes led to state being mainly a commuter state for work ) 1967 , Present * West Virginia , corporate , from 1967 ; * Connecticut , intangibles ( but taxing capital gains and not interest ) , from 1969 ; * Illinois , individual and corporate , from 1969 ; * Maine , individual and corporate , from 1969 ; * New Hampshire , corporate , from 1970 ; * Florida , franchise , from 1971 ; * Ohio , individual and corporate , from 1971 ; * Pennsylvania , individual , from 1971 ; * Rhode Island , individual , from 1971 ; * The Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands , individual and corporate , from 1971 .
In the early 1970s , Pennsylvania and Ohio competed for businesses with Ohio wooing industries with a reduced corporate income tax but Pennsylvania warning that Ohio had higher municipal taxes that included taxes on inventories , machinery and equipment .
A few more events of the 1970s :
* Michigan abolished its corporate income tax in 1975 , replacing it with another value - added tax ; * New Jersey instituted an individual income tax in 1976 ; * The Northern Mariana Islands negotiated with the U.S. in 1975 a mirror tax which was to go into effect in 1979 , but in 1979 enacted a law rebating that tax partially or entirely each year and levying a simpler income tax ;
* Alaska abolished its individual income tax retroactive to 1979 in 1980 .
The only subsequent individual income tax instituted to date is Connecticut 's , from 1991 , replacing the earlier intangibles tax .
The median family income in many of the state 's suburbs was nearly twice that of families living in urban areas .
Governor Lowell Weicker 's administration imposed a personal income tax to address the inequities of the sales tax system , and implemented a program to modify state funding formulas so that urban communities received a larger share .
Numerous states with income taxes have considered measures to abolish those taxes since the Late-2000s recession began , and several states without income taxes have considered measures to institute them , but only one such proposal has been enacted : Michigan replaced its more recent value - added tax with a new corporate income tax in 2009 .
