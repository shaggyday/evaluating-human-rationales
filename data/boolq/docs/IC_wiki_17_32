PENTALOBE SECURITY SCREW
The pentalobe security screw ( Apple nomenclature ) , or pentalobe screw drive , is a five - pointed tamper - resistant system used by but not limited to Apple in their products .
Pentalobe screws were adopted by Apple starting in 2009 , when they were first implemented in the 15-inch MacBook Pro .
They have since been used on other MacBook Pro , MacBook Air and iPhone models .
Apple attracted criticism upon the introduction of the pentalobe screw ; it was seen by some as an attempt to lock individuals out of their devices .
Inexpensive pentalobe screwdrivers , manufactured by third parties , are relatively easy to obtain .
Pentalobe screw sizes include TS1 ( 0.8 mm , used on every iPhone after and including the iPhone 4 ) , TS4 ( 1.2 mm , used on the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro with Retina display ) , and TS5 ( 1.5 mm , used on the 2009 MacBook Pro battery ) .
The TS designation is ambiguous as it is also used for the Torq - set screw drive .
USAGE MACBOOK PRO Section::::Usage .
Section::::MacBook Pro .
The first Apple product to include pentalobe screws internally was the Mid 2009 MacBook Pro 15-inch model .
Three pentalobe screws were used to attach the battery to the internal frame .
A 1.5 mm flat - blade ( slotted ) screwdriver could easily remove these screws , which were originally mistaken for 5-point Torx screws .
This was the only internal usage of pentalobe screws ; all following MacBook Pros use the " Tri - Wing " security bit to attach the battery to the internal frame , or else have glued - in batteries .
Pentalobe screws reappeared in the mid-2012 version of the MacBook Pro .
Eight 3 mm and two 2.3 mm pentalobe screws were used externally to attach the bottom plate of the case to the internal frame .
The late-2012 version of the 13-inch MacBook Pro was the first 13-inch model to have pentalobe screws ; several were used externally in a similar fashion to the 15-inch mid-2012 MacBook Pro .
None of the three 17-inch models of the MacBook Pro have used any pentalobe screws .
MACBOOK AIR Section::::MacBook Air .
The MacBook Air has seen more extensive use of pentalobe screws than the MacBook Pro .
All five versions of the 11-inch MacBook Air ( late-2010 , mid-2011 , mid-2012 , mid-2013 and early-2014 ) include eight 2.5 mm - long and two 8 mm - long external pentalobe screws .
The last five versions of the 13-inch MacBook Air ( late-2010 , mid-2011 , mid-2012 , mid-2013 and early-2014 ) use eight 2.6 mm - long and two 9 mm - long pentalobe screws .
Pentalobe screws have been used only externally on MacBook Air models .
Third - party manufacturers have marketed a variety of 5-point screwdrivers that fit pentalobe screws on MacBook models since pentalobe screws first appeared externally in the late-2010 MacBook Air .
HUAWEI
Section::::Huawei .
Huawei used pentalobe screws for the Huawei P9 , a decision criticised by Kyle Wiens writing for Wired , because using pentalobe screws instead of standard screws like Torx , makes electronics more difficult to repair .
Its successor , the Huawei P10 also used pentalobe screws to secure the back cover to the phone .
IPHONES Section::::iPhones .
The original iPhone had no screws holding the body together .
The iPhone 3 G and the iPhone 3GS had two # 00 Phillips screws next to the 30-pin Dock Connector .
Pentalobe screws were first used in the iPhone 4 .
At first , # 00 Phillips screws were used ; however , many iPhone 4 models now have pentalobe screws .
The screws used are slightly smaller than a Torx TS1 , about 0.8 mm .
If brought in to an Apple Store for repair , iPhone 4 models with # 00 Phillips screws , if any , are replaced with 0.8 mm pentalobe screws .
Third - party manufacturers rushed to produce screwdrivers that would remove 0.8 mm pentalobe screws after the iPhone 4 's release in June 2010 .
These inexpensive , easily purchased drivers will remove pentalobe screws quite easily .
Many are sold as " kits " containing a 5-point driver and Phillips # 00 screws , in order to replace pentalobe screws with easily removable Phillips screws .
Most other security screwdrivers will strip the miniature heads , effectively locking the user out of their device .
All iPhone 4S models contain identical pentalobe screws to those found on the iPhone 4 .
The iPhone 5 has very similar 0.8 mm pentalobe screws , but the screws have longer 3.6 mm shafts .
SIZES AND MEASUREMENTS Section::::Sizes and measurements .
Although there is no ( known ) official standard naming - scheme ; the size is commonly known as P - sizes .
TS - sizes are sometimes used ; but leave room for mixing up with regular Torx sizes .
The following P and TS sizes are used by iFixit.com , and PL sizes by Wiha , a German tool company :

These pentalobe heads are not to be confused with Torx Plus Security heads , because they have 6 edges .
