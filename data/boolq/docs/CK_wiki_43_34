LIST OF EUROVISION SONG
CONTEST WINNERS Sixty - six songs have won the Eurovision Song Contest , an annual competition organised by member countries of the European Broadcasting Union .
The contest , which has been broadcast every year since its debut in 1956 , is one of the longest - running television programmes in the world .
The contest 's winner has been determined using numerous voting techniques throughout its history ; centre to these have been the awarding of points to countries by juries or televoters .
The country awarded the most points is declared the winner .
The first Eurovision Song Contest was not won on points , but by votes ( two per country ) , and only the winner was announced .
There have been 63 contests , with one winner each year except the tied 1969 contest , which had four .
Twenty - seven different countries have won the contest .
Switzerland won the first contest in 1956 .
The country with the highest number of wins is Ireland , with seven .
The only person to have won more than once as performer is Ireland 's Johnny Logan , who performed " What 's Another Year " in 1980 and " Hold Me Now " in 1987 .
Logan is also one of only five songwriters to have written more than one winning entry ( " Hold Me Now " 1987 and " Why Me ?
" 1992 , performed by Linda Martin ) .
This unique distinction makes Logan the only person to have three Eurovision victories to his / her credit , as either singer , songwriter or both .
The other four songwriters with more than one winning entry to their credit are , Willy van Hemert ( Netherlands , 1957 and 1959 ) , Yves Dessca ( Monaco , 1971 and Luxembourg , 1972 ) , Rolf Løvland ( Norway , 1985 and 1995 ) and Brendan Graham ( Ireland , 1994 and 1996 ) .
Winning the Eurovision Song Contest provides a unique opportunity for the winning artist(s ) to capitalise on their success and surrounding publicity by launching or furthering their international career during their singing years .
However , throughout the history of the contest , relatively few of these artists have gone on to be huge international stars .
The most notable winning Eurovision artists whose career was directly launched into the spotlight following their win were the members of ABBA , who won the 1974 contest for Sweden with their song " Waterloo " .
ABBA went on to be one of the most successful bands of its time .
Another notable winner who subsequently achieved international fame and success was Céline Dion , who won the 1988 contest for Switzerland with the song
" Ne partez pas sans moi " .

BY YEAR MadridNettaList of Eurovision Song Contest winning songwriters .
Eleven Eurovision winners ( alongside three non - winners ) featured at the Congratulations concert in 2005 , in which ABBA 's " Waterloo " was voted the most popular song of the contest 's first fifty years .
Ireland has finished first seven times , more than any other country , Ireland also won the contest for three consecutive years ( 1992 , 1993 , 1994 ) , more consecutive years than any other country .
Three countries have won twice in a row , Spain ( 1968 and 1969 ) , Luxembourg ( 1972 and 1973 ) and Israel ( 1978 and 1979 ) .
Along with Switzerland 's win in the first contest , Serbia is the only other country to win with its debut entry ( in 2007 ) , though Serbia had competed prior as part of Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro .
Under the voting system used between 1975 and 2015 , the winner of the contest was decided by the final voting nation on eleven occasions .
Changes to the voting system , including a steady growth in the number of countries participating and voting , means that the points earned are not comparable across the decades .
Portugal 's Salvador Sobral holds the record of the highest number of points in the contest 's history , earning 758 with the song " Amar pelos dois " .
Norway 's Alexander Rybak holds the largest margin of victory in absolute points , a 169-point cushion over second place in 2009 .
Italy 's Gigliola Cinquetti holds the record for largest victory by percentage , scoring almost three times as many as second place ( 49 points compared with 17 by the runner - up ) in the 1964 contest .
Under the voting system used from 1975 until 2015 , the lowest winning score was Norway 's Bobbysocks !
123 points earned ( of the 216 available from the 18 other countries ) when winning Eurovision 1985 , while the lowest winning total ever is the 18 points ( of the 160 total votes cast by 16 countries ) scored by each of the four winning countries in 1969 .
Under the voting system used from 1975 until 2015 , in which each country gives maximum points to its first place choice , Sweden 's Loreen won Eurovision 2012 with the most ever first place votes earned , receiving first place votes from 18 of 41 countries ( excluding themselves ) .
The 1976 United Kingdom entrant , Brotherhood of Man with the song " Save Your Kisses For Me " holds the record of the highest average score per participating country , with an average of 9.65 points received per country .
2011 winner Azerbaijan Eldar & Nigar , hold the lowest average score for a winning song under that system , receiving 5.14 points per country .
The United Kingdom has finished second fifteen times at Eurovision ( most recently in 1998 ) , more than any other country .
The most successful country never to have won the Contest is Malta , having finished second in 2002 and 2005 and third in 1992 and 1998 .
Another island nation Iceland has also finished second twice , in 1999 and 2009 .
There is no official runner - up for two of the contests – 1956 and 1969 .
In 1956 only the winner , Switzerland , was announced , whilst there were speculative reports that Germany ended up in second place with " I m Wartesaal zum großen Glück " by Walter Andreas Schwarz , given that Germany was chosen to host the 1957 contest .
In 1969 four songs shared first place by achieving the same number of points ; fifth place was achieved by Switzerland , which is not considered an official runner - up , because of the draw for first place .
