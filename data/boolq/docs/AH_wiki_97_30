An early account of life at the Mission was written by one of its Native American converts , Luiseño Pablo Tac , in his work Indian Life and Customs at Mission San Luis Rey : A Record of California Mission Life by Pablo Tac , An Indian Neophyte ( written c.1835 in Rome , later edited and translated in 1958 by Minna Hewes and Gordon Hewes ) .
In his book , Tac lamented the rapid population decline of his Luiseño people after the founding of the mission :
In Quechla not long ago there were 5,000 souls , with all their neighboring lands .
Through a sickness that came to California , 2,000 souls died , and 3,000 were left .
The Mission - born , Franciscan - educated Tac wrote that his people initially attempted to bar the Spaniards from invading their Southern California lands .
When the foreigners approached : " ...
the chief stood up ... and met them , " demanding , " ...
what are you looking for ?
Leave our Country ! "
