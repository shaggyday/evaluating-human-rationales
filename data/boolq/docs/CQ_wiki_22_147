PLOT Section::::Plot .
Ivy Templeton ( Susan Swift ) is a ten - year - old girl , living with her parents , Janice and Bill Templeton ( Marsha Mason and John Beck ) , in New York City .
Her parents notice a stranger stalking them over the course of a few weeks , and discover , over lunch with him , that his name is Elliot Hoover ( Anthony Hopkins ) .
Hoover is convinced that Ivy is a reincarnation of his daughter Audrey Rose , who died in a fiery car accident , along with his wife , two minutes before Ivy was born .
Hoover had come to believe this through information given to him by two clairvoyant psychics .
Bill asks a friend of his , an attorney , to hide in their apartment to hear Hoover 's full story to build a case against him , but when Hoover speaks Audrey 's name out loud , Ivy hears him from her room and enters an altered state where she can not be calmed down without the assistance of Hoover .
In this state , she bangs her hands on a window and becomes burned , which Hoover says is a result of his daughter 's experience of being burned alive in the car .
Janice is afraid of Hoover but is also concerned for her daughter , while Bill is hostile to Hoover and demands he stay away .
Ivy continues to be disturbed by nightmares , which worsen .
Hoover appears at their home during one of her nightmares , and at the request of the mother , Hoover is able to calm Ivy down by calling to her as Audrey Rose but is arrested for allegedly briefly abducting her to his recently rented upstairs apartment .
The film then segues to an ongoing trial , where Hoover is attempting to persuade a jury that his actions were necessary to grant his daughter 's spirit peace .
The trial has become a worldwide phenomenon , with a Hindu holy man giving an explanation of reincarnation as testimony .
Hoover testifies in court that after his daughter 's death , Hoover had traveled to India and become a believer in reincarnation and Hinduism .
Janice comes to believe Hoover 's story , and testifies as much , but Bill does not , and has their lawyer request Ivy be hypnotized to show she is not a reincarnation of Audrey Rose .
During the hypnosis , Ivy revisits the traumatic car crash as Audrey Rose and dies during the relived trauma .
The last scene is Janice writing a letter to Hoover thanking him for transporting Ivy / Audrey 's ashes to India , and indicating this is with her husband 's permission , whom she says has started to accept what she and Hoover believe to be true .
The movie closes on a quotation from the Bhagavad - Gita : " There is no end .
For the soul there is never birth nor death .
Nor , having once been , does it ever cease to be .
It is unborn , eternal , ever - existing , undying and primeval ... "

The film has a score of 46 % on Rotten Tomatoes based on 13 reviews .
Vincent Canby of The New York Times said : " The soul of the movie is that of The Exorcist instantly recycled . "
Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three stars out of four and called the first hour " excellent " but the second half " pretty bad ...
The picture falls apart as it turns into a dumb legal melodrama replete with cross - examination and a hypnotized key witness . "
Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times praised the " first - rate acting " but added , " In a way , ' Audrey Rose ' may go too far in denying the mystery and proclaiming the certainty of reincarnation .
The handling denies the story of some of the spookiness of an exercise in style like ' Do n't Look Now , ' and the literalness has a way of putting off those who might be willing to go along for the ride . "
For Newsweek 's Janet Maslin Audrey Rose lacked " not only any sign of intelligence , but also that other prerequisite of a good horror movie - fast pacing " ; while the Saturday Review 's Judith Crist thought the film " starts out as a titillating little thriller , but after 20 mins it bogs down in a series of minilectures on reincarnation that wipe out whatever dramatic potential the story might have had .
"
More mixed was Richard Combs writing for The Monthly Film Bulletin : "
Before the film collapses into [ ... ] bathetic nonsense [ ... ] it displays a dramatic rationale and figurative substance that makes it at least as diverting as Rosemary 's Baby , and a cut above the special effects hocus - pocus of its nearer predecessors in the demonology genre . "
Cinefantastique 's Paul Petlewski was also more measured in his assessment : " Although Audrey Rose is an honourable film , it is n't particularly memorable or even an important one [ ... ]
Its interest is partly historical the [ Val ] Lewton connection and partly aesthetic - the pleasure derived from watching a talented director attempt to transcend his silly material . "
