JACARANDA Jacaranda is a genus of 49 species of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae , native to tropical and subtropical regions of Mexico , Central America , South America , Cuba , Hispaniola , Jamaica , and the Bahamas .
It has been planted widely in Asia especially in Nepal .
Jacaranda mimosifolia is quite common in southern California , Florida , Argentina , South Africa , Zimbabwe , Australia , New Zealand , Spain and Zambia and has been introduced to most tropical and subtropical regions to the extent that it has entered the popular culture .
The generic name is also used as the common name .
ETYMOLOGY Section::::Etymology .
The name is believed to be of Guarani origin , meaning fragrant .
The word jacaranda was described in A supplement to Mr. Chambers 's Cyclopædia , 1st ed .
, ( 1753 ) as " a name given by some authors to the tree the wood of which is the log - wood , used in dyeing and in medicine " and as being of Tupi - Guarani origin , by way of Portuguese .
Although not consistent with the Guarani source , one common pronunciation of the name in English is given by .
DESCRIPTION Section::::Description .
The species are shrubs to large trees ranging in size from tall .
The leaves are bipinnate in most species , pinnate or simple in a few species .
The flowers are produced in conspicuous large panicles , each flower with a five - lobed blue to purple - blue corolla ; a few species have white flowers .
The fruit is an oblong to oval flattened capsule containing numerous slender seeds .
The genus differs from other genera in the Bignoniaceae in having a staminode that is longer than the stamens , tricolpate pollen , and a chromosome number of 18 .
TAXONOMY Section::::Taxonomy .
The genus is divided into two sections , sect .
Monolobos and sect .
Dilobos DC . , based on the number of thecae on the anthers .
Sect .
Jacaranda has 18 species and is found primarily in western South America , Central America , Mexico , and the Caribbean .
Sect .
Dilobos , which is believed to be the primitive form , has 31 species and is found primarily in southeastern Brazil including the Paraná River valley .
The anatomy of the wood in the two sections also differs .
Although usually treated in sect .
Jacaranda , J. copaia differs somewhat from all other members of the genus , and may be intermediate between the two sections ( Dos Santos & Miller 1997 ) .

Jacaranda can be propagated from grafting , cuttings and seeds , though plants grown from seeds take a long time to bloom .
Jacaranda grows in well drained soil and tolerates drought and brief spells of frost and freeze .
This genus thrives in full sun and sandy soils , which explains their abundance in warmer climates .
Mature plants can survive in colder climates down to ; however , they may not bloom as profusely .
Younger plants are more fragile and may not survive in colder climates when temperatures drop below freezing .
USES Section::::Uses .
Several species are widely grown as ornamental plants throughout the subtropical regions of the world , valued for their intense flower displays .
The most often seen is the Blue Jacaranda Jacaranda mimosifolia ( syn .
J. acutifolia hort .
non Bonpl . ) .
Other members of the genus are also commercially important ; for example the Copaia ( Jacaranda copaia ) is important for its timber because of its exceptionally long bole .
