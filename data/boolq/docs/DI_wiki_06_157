LIST OF AC / DC MEMBERS AC / DC are an Australian hard rock formed in Australia in November 1973 by brothers Angus ( lead guitar ) and Malcolm Young ( rhythm guitar ) .
The original lineup of the group featured vocalist Dave Evans , bassist Larry Van Kriedt and drummer Colin Burgess .
The band 's first single "
Can I Sit Next to You
, Girl " was released after the departure of Van Kriedt , with a third Young brother , producer George , filling in on bass .
AC / DC subsequently went through numerous early personnel changes , including replacing Evans with Bon Scott in time for the recording of their debut Australian album High Voltage , which also featured contributions from George Young and session drummer Tony Currenti .
By early 1975 , the band had settled on a lineup of Angus and Malcolm Young , Bon Scott , bassist Mark Evans and drummer Phil Rudd .
Shortly after the release of the group 's fourth studio album Let There Be Rock in 1977 , Evans was fired from AC / DC due to growing tensions with the Young brothers .
He was replaced by English bassist Cliff Williams .
After two more studio albums , Scott died on 19 February 1980 of acute alcohol poisoning .
The band briefly considered breaking up , but later enlisted former Geordie frontman Brian Johnson as Scott 's replacement .
In 1983 , following a physical altercation with Malcolm Young and ongoing problems with substance abuse , Rudd was fired from AC / DC .
He was replaced by Simon Wright , who remained until 1989 before joining Dio .
Wright was replaced by Welsh drummer Chris Slade for five years , before Rudd returned in late 1994 during sessions for the group 's thirteenth studio album Ballbreaker .
The lineup of AC / DC remained largely constant until April 2014 , when Malcolm Young retired due to ill health .
The group recorded Rock or Bust with Stevie Young , Angus and Malcolm 's nephew , who was made an official member of the band in September .
Stevie Young had previously toured with AC / DC while Malcolm was fighting alcohol addiction .
Rudd was later arrested and pleaded guilty to drug charges and threatening to kill a former assistant , with Slade returning to replace him on the Rock or Bust World Tour .
In March 2016 , several dates on the ongoing tour were cancelled after Johnson was ordered by doctors to cease touring due to " severe hearing problems " .
The following month , it was announced that Guns N ' Roses frontman Axl Rose would replace Johnson for all future tour dates .
Long - term bassist Cliff Williams retired after the tour , with his last show taking place on 20 September 2016 .
Following the conclusion of the Rock or Bust World Tour , it was reported that Angus Young , Stevie Young and Rose would continue AC / DC with new musicians once the Guns N ' Roses Not in This Lifetime ...
Tour had concluded , with a new studio album planned .
Malcolm and George Young both died in late 2017 .
