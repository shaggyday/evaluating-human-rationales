LIST OF CALIFORNIA HURRICANES
A California hurricane is a tropical cyclone that affects the state of California .
Usually , only the remnants of tropical cyclones affect California .
Since 1900 , only two tropical storms have hit California , one by direct landfall from offshore , another after making landfall in Mexico .
Since 1850 , only seven tropical cyclones have brought gale - force winds to the Southwestern United States .
They are : The 1858 San Diego hurricane that was reconstructed as just missing landfall in 1858 , the 1939 Long Beach tropical storm that made landfall near San Pedro in 1939 , the remnants of Tropical Storm Jennifer - Katherine in 1963 , the remnants of Hurricane Emily in 1965 , the remnants of Hurricane Joanne in 1972 , the remnants of Hurricane Kathleen in 1976 , and Hurricane Nora in 1997 , after it was downgraded to a tropical storm .
In most cases , rainfall is the only effect that these cyclones have on California .
Sometimes , the rainfall is severe enough to cause flooding and damage .
For example , floods from Hurricane Kathleen devastated Ocotillo , California and killed several people .
EXPLANATION FOR RARITY Section::::Explanation for rarity .
There are two reasons why tropical cyclones rarely strike California at tropical storm intensity or higher : sea surface temperatures , and the usual upper level steering winds in the eastern Pacific , with sea surface temperatures being more important .
Tropical cyclones usually require very warm water to depth , generally above 26.5 ° C ( 80 ° F ) extending to a depth of 50 meters ( 160 ft ) .
However , the waters off California are cold even in summer .
They rarely rise above 24 ° C ( 75 ° F ) in near - shore southern California , and usually remain below 17 ° C ( 63 ° F ) along most of the rest of the coast and outer coastal waters , although El Niño events may warm the waters somewhat .
This is due primarily to the extensive upwelling of colder sub - surface waters caused by the prevailing northwesterly winds acting through the Ekman Effect .
The winds drive surface water to the right of the wind flow , that is offshore , which draws water up from below to replace it .
The upwelling further cools the already cool California Current which runs north to south along coastal California and even much of coastal Baja California .
This is the same mechanism which produces coastal California 's characteristic fog .
The second reason is the general path of tropical cyclones in the eastern Pacific .
They generally move north - westward or westward due to steering by the prevailing upper level winds , which takes them far out to sea and away from land .
These factors make eastern Pacific landfalls improbable north of about central Baja California .
In those instances when upper level steering winds do allow a more northerly path , much cooler sea surface temperatures quickly weaken tropical cyclones that approach California , although torrential rainfall can still occur .
For example , the September 24-hour rainfall record for Los Angeles is held by the 1939 Long Beach Tropical Storm , as of January 2007 .
LIST OF TROPICAL CYCLONES Section::::List of tropical cyclones .
Hurricanes that affect California are mainly the remnants of hurricanes or tropical storms .
In the twentieth century , only four eastern Pacific tropical cyclones have brought tropical storm - force winds to the Continental United States : the 1939 Long Beach Tropical Storm , Tropical Storm Joanne in 1972 , Tropical Storm Kathleen in 1976 , and Tropical Storm Nora in 1997 .
PRE–1930 Section::::Pre–1930 .
*
After October 1854 : A system considered to be a tropical cyclone made landfall over northern California , just north of the Golden Gate .
* October 2 , 1858 :
The 1858 San Diego hurricane passed very close to Southern California .
It brought several hours of hurricane and gale - force winds to an area stretching from San Diego to Los Angeles .
This storm was reconstructed as just missing making landfall , dissipating offshore .
*
Sometime before October 14 , 1858 : Since this tropical cyclone is reported in a newspaper as being only " one of the most terrific and violent hurricanes ever noted " , the report may imply the existence of an earlier hurricane in southern California .
Other than occurring before the newspaper account was published ( October 18 , 1858 ) , everything else about this " hurricane " , including whether it even existed , is unknown .
*
Before June or after October 1859 : A system considered to be a tropical cyclone made landfall between Cape Mendocino and San Francisco Bay . * August 11–12 , 1873 : Rain from a tropical storm fell on San Diego .

Winds were near 80 km / h ( 50 mph ) and rain was near 12 inches ( 300 mm ) .
At sea , 48 people were killed .
On land , 45 were killed in flooding , although these deaths may be partially attributable to a nasty thunderstorm immediately preceding the tropical storm .

* October 11–15 , 2009 : The remnants of Typhoon Melor affected California and broke several rainfall records .
The storm system also opened up a Pineapple Express , an atmospheric river originating near Hawaii .
2010S
* July 18–20 , 2012 : Associated moisture and clouds from the remnants of Hurricane Fabio generated scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms across the Los Angeles Basin .
* September 5–7 , 2012 : Moisture from the remnants of Tropical Storm John brought scattered showers and thunderstorms to California .
* August 25–26 , 2013 : Moisture from the remnants of Tropical Storm Ivo caused some thunderstorms and flooding in southern California .

* September 8 , 2014 : The remnants of Hurricane Norbert caused thunderstorms and flooding in Southern California .
* September 16–17 , 2014 : Hurricane Odile 's outer rainbands brought thunderstorms to parts of Southern California , as a tropical storm .
The remnants of Hurricane Odile also caused damage across central and eastern San Diego County on September 16 , 2014 , generating high winds and several uncharacteristically powerful thunderstorms in the region .
Wind gusts over 20 knots reportedly uprooting trees , felled branches , cut power lines , crushed several cars , and flipped at least one airplane at Montgomery Field Airport .
Dry lightning generated by a line of severe thunderstorms in one of the rainbands set fire to a palm tree in San Diego and storm force wind gusts within those severe thunderstorms left 6000 customers without power .
* October 6–7 , 2014 : Hurricane Simon 's outer rainbands bring scattered thunderstorms and flash floods to parts of Southern California as a tropical storm , and later as a tropical depression , with a brief rain shower in San Diego County on October 7 .
* June 9–10 , 2015 :
A low pressure system containing the remnants of Hurricane Blanca brought showers to Southern California on June 9 .
Some flooding was reported in Santa Barbara County .
On June 10 , the low pressure system moved north to the San Francisco Bay Area and brought scattered showers there as well .
Many rainfall records were broken .
* July 18–20 , 2015 : The remnants of Hurricane Dolores brought scattered showers and thunderstorms throughout Southern California , breaking many rainfall records and causing flooding .
One such flash flood caused a bridge to collapse which shut down Interstate 10 between Indio and Blythe , effectively shutting off the primary Phoenix - to - Los - Angeles route .
The good news was that the rain helped firefighters contain the North Fire within 3 days .
* August 6 , 2015 : Hurricane Guillermo interacted with a longwave trough in the subtropical jet to its northeast to spawn a rare dry - season atmospheric river , which went on to send moisture toward the San Francisco Bay Area , bringing a rare lightning storm to that area that night .
Since the storm was dry and hardly brought any rain , the NWS issued a Red Flag Warning for that area .
* September 8–15 , 2015 : The remnants of Hurricane Linda brought localized downpours from Santa Barbara to San Diego , California .
On September 15 , Los Angeles received 2.39 inches of rain , making it one of the wettest September days since records dating back to 1877 , second only to 1939 .
* July 11–12 , 2017 :
Dangerous rip currents from Hurricane Eugene combined with swells of 4 to 8 ft ( 1.2 to 2.4 m ) across Southern California .
* September 3–4 , 2017 :
Moisture from Tropical Storm Lidia 's remnant low brought flash flooding and thunderstorms to Southern California .
Lidia 's remnants also triggered a microburst event in Santa Barbara .
* July 7–8 , 2018 : As a tropical storm , Hurricane Fabio brought rip currents to the coastline of California , and showers and humid conditions to Northern California .
* August 9–11 , 2018 : Hurricane John brought high surf to the coast of Southern California .
* October 1 , 2018 : Hurricane Rosa brought scattered thunderstorms to parts of Southern California as a tropical storm , triggering flash flood watches in San Diego County .
* October 12 , 2018 : The remnants of Hurricane Sergio spawned numerous thunderstorms in Southern California , as well as triggering a high surf advisory along the coast .
One thunderstorm made by the remnants of Sergio caused a power outage in Montebello that lasted from 10:00 P.M. to 1:00 A.M. PT ( Pacific Time ) .
CLIMATOLOGICAL STATISTICS
Section::::Climatological statistics .
Most tropical cyclones impacting California do so in the month of September .
September 1939 was " unprecedented " in having four tropical cyclones impact the state .
DEADLIEST STORMS Section::::Deadliest storms .
The following is a list of all known tropical cyclone - related deaths in California . !
Name !
Year !
Number of deaths MODERN REPEATS Section::::Modern repeats .
While rare , tropical cyclones do affect California , occasionally very seriously as far as rainfall is concerned .
DAMAGE Section::::Damage .
A modern repeat of the 1858 storm is estimated to cause damages of hundreds of millions of dollars .
A repeat of the 1939 tropical storm would cause around 200 million dollars in damage .
The most serious damage would be due to rains rather than winds or storm surge , although distant hurricanes may still create heavy surf , possibly injuring or killing people .
Nora caused millions in damage and skirted extreme southeastern California .
PREPAREDNESS Section::::Preparedness .
When Hurricane Linda was forecast to make landfall , statements about its possible impact were issued by the Oxnard , California office of the National Weather Service .
They stressed the uncertainty of a forecast that far in the future .
When Nora was threatening , " unprecedented coordination " was required between the NHC and several other agencies .
The coordination was " smooth and effective " .
However , no inland tropical storm warnings were issued for any area in the United States as Nora was approaching from the south .
There are seven Pacific Coast breakpoints in the United States .
They are , from north to south , Point Piedras Blancas , Point Sal , Point Conception , Point Mugu , the mouth of the San Gabriel River , San Mateo Point , and the mouth of the Tijuana River ( although places outside this area can be selected if conditions warrant ) .
Should there be the threat of landfall , warnings or watches would be issued for those sections of the coast .
It is highly unlikely that any tropical cyclone will threaten areas farther north , due to the stronger influence of the California Current .
