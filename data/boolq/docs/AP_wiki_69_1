ADVANCE HEALTHCARE DIRECTIVE
An advance healthcare directive , also known as living will , personal directive , advance directive , medical directive or advance decision , is a legal document in which a person specifies what actions should be taken for their health if they are no longer able to make decisions for themselves because of illness or incapacity .
In the U.S. it has a legal status in itself , whereas in some countries it is legally persuasive without being a legal document .
A living will is one form of advance directive , leaving instructions for treatment .
Another form is a specific type of power of attorney or health care proxy , in which the person authorizes someone ( an agent ) to make decisions on their behalf when they are incapacitated .
People are often encouraged to complete both documents to provide comprehensive guidance regarding their care , although they may be combined into a single form .
An example of combination documents includes the Five Wishes in the United States .
The term living will is also the commonly recognised vernacular in many countries , especially the U.K. BACKGROUND Section::::Background .
Advance directives were created in response to the increasing sophistication and prevalence of medical technology .
Numerous studies have documented critical deficits in the medical care of the dying ; it has been found to be unnecessarily prolonged , painful , expensive , and emotionally burdensome to both patients and their families .
LIVING WILL
Section::::Living will .
The living will is the oldest form of advance directive .
It was first proposed by an Illinois attorney , Luis Kutner , in a law journal in 1969 .
Kutner drew from existing estate law , by which an individual can control property affairs after death ( i.e. , when no longer available to speak for himself or herself ) and devised a way for an individual to express his or her health care desires when no longer able to express current healthcare wishes .
Because this form of " will " was to be used while an individual was still alive ( but no longer able to make decisions )
it was dubbed the " living will " .
In the U.S. , The Patient Self - Determination Act ( PSDA ) went into effect in December 1991 , and required healthcare providers ( primarily hospitals , nursing homes and home health agencies ) to give patients information about their rights to make advance directives under state law .
A living will usually provides specific directives about the course of treatment healthcare providers and caregivers are to follow .
In some cases a living will may forbid the use of various kinds of burdensome medical treatment .
It may also be used to express wishes about the use or foregoing of food and water , if supplied via tubes or other medical devices .
The living will is used only if the individual has become unable to give informed consent or refusal due to incapacity .
A living will can be very specific or very general .
An example of a statement sometimes found in a living will is : " If I suffer an incurable , irreversible illness , disease , or condition and my attending physician determines that my condition is terminal , I direct that life - sustaining measures that would serve only to prolong my dying be withheld or discontinued . "
More specific living wills may include information regarding an individual 's desire for such services such as analgesia ( pain relief ) , antibiotics , hydration , feeding , and the use of ventilators or cardiopulmonary resuscitation .
However , studies have also shown that adults are more likely to complete these documents if they are written in everyday language and less focused on technical treatments .
However , by the late 1980s , public advocacy groups became aware that many people remained unaware of advance directives and even fewer actually completed them .
In part , this was seen as a failure of health care providers and medical organizations to promote and support the use of these documents .
The public 's response was to press for further legislative support .
The most recent result was the Patient Self - Determination Act of 1990 , which attempted to address this awareness problem by requiring health care institutions to better promote and support the use of advance directives .
Living wills proved to be very popular , and by 2007 , 41 % of Americans had completed a living will .
In response to public needs , state legislatures soon passed laws in support of living wills in virtually every state in the union .
However , as living wills began to be better recognized , key deficits were soon discovered .
Most living wills tended to be limited in scope and often failed to fully address presenting problems and needs .
Further , many individuals wrote out their wishes in ways that might conflict with quality medical practice .
Ultimately , it was determined that a living will alone might be insufficient to address many important health care decisions .
This led to the development of what some have called " second generation " advance directives – the " health care proxy appointment " or " medical power of attorney . "
Living wills also reflect a moment in time , and may therefore need regular updating to ensure that the correct course of action can be chosen .
DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY AND HEALTHCARE
PROXY SECOND
GENERATION ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Section::::Durable power of attorney and healthcare proxy .
Section::::Second generation advance directives .
As before , the next generation advance directive was drawn from existing law – specifically from business law .
Power of attorney statutes have existed in the United States since the days of " common law " ( i.e. , laws brought from England to the United States during the colonial period ) .
These early powers of attorney allowed an individual to name someone to act in their stead .
Drawing upon these laws , " durable powers of attorney for health care " and " healthcare proxy appointment " documents were created and codified in law , allowing an individual to appoint someone to make healthcare decisions in their behalf if they should ever be rendered incapable of making their wishes known .
The appointed healthcare proxy has , in essence , the same rights to request or refuse treatment that the individual would have if still capable of making and communicating health care decisions .
The primary benefit of second - generation advance directives is that the appointed representative can make real - time decisions in actual circumstances , as opposed to advance decisions framed in hypothetical situations , as recorded in a living will .
This new advance directive was heartily endorsed by the U.S. public , and supporting legislation soon followed in virtually all states .
Eventually , however , deficiencies in " second - generation " advance directives were also soon noted .
Primarily , individuals faced problems similar to those that handicapped living wills – knowing what to tell the proxy decision - maker about one 's wishes in a meaningful way .
Studies found most of what appointed proxies are told is too vague for meaningful interpretation .
In the absence of meaningful information , family and physician " guesswork " is found to be inaccurate as much as 76 % of the time .
While a study comparing next - of - kin decisions on behalf of an incapacitated person , ( who later recovered ) found that these surrogates chose correctly 68 % of the time overall .
This continuing problem led to the development of what might be called " third generation " advance directives .
THIRD GENERATION ADVANCE DIRECTIVES Section::::Third generation advance directives .
Third generation advance directives were designed to contain enriched content to assist individuals and their appointed agents , families , and physicians to better understand and honor their wishes .
The first of the third - generation advance directives was the Values History by Doukas and McCullough , created at the Georgetown University School of Medicine , first published in 1988 , and then more widely cited in an article in 1991 .
The Values History is a " two - part advance directive instrument that elicits patient values about terminal medical care and therapy - specific directives .
" The goal of this advance directive is to move away from a focus on specific treatments and medical procedures to a focus on patient values and personal goals .
Another values - based project was later published by Lambert , Gibson , and Nathanson at the Institute of Public Law , University of New Mexico School of Law in 1990 .
It continues to be made available via the Hospice and Palliative Care Federation .
One persistent challenge of third generation - based values documents is to show a linkage between the elicited values and goals with medical care wishes , although studies have demonstrated that values regarding financial and psychological burden are strong motivators in not wanting a broad array of end - of - life therapies .
The next widely recognized third generation advance directive is the Medical Directive , created by Emanuel and Emanuel of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School .
It is a six - page document that provides six case scenarios for advance medical decision - making .
The scenarios are each associated with a roster of commonly considered medical procedures and interventions , allowing the individual to decide in advance which treatments are wanted or not wanted under the circumstances .
Several criticisms regarding this advance directive have been expressed .
Primarily , it prompts individuals to make medical treatment decisions , which they are typically not equipped to make .
Perhaps the best known third - generation advance directive is the Five Wishes directive .
This document was developed in collaboration with multiple experts with funding from the Robert Wood Johnson foundation , and is distributed by the organization Aging with Dignity .
The document was endorsed by Mother Teresa of the Sisters of Calcutta and by the Chief Justice of the Florida state supreme court .
The document meets statutory criteria in 42 states .
The most recent third - generation advance directive is the Lifecare Advance Directive .
In creating this document , researchers reviewed more than 6,500 articles from medical , legal , sociological , and theological sources .
The conclusion was that advance directives needed to be based more on " health outcome states " than on rosters of medical treatments and legal jargon .
Building upon the insights gleaned from the literature review , an advance directive document created , tested in a study involving nearly 1,000 participants , and then comparison tested against other popular advance directive forms .
The results indicated greater patient / proxy decision - making accuracy , and superior comprehensive content as compared with other documents tested .
The primary criticism has been that it is very lengthy and tedious to complete .
While some commentators suggest that any recording of one 's wishes is problematic , the preponderance of experts recommend the completion of an advance directive document – especially one that includes both a living will and a proxy designation .
While most of the public continue to rely upon their state 's standard directive format , research demonstrates that many of these documents are too jargon laden and vague , confusing , and incomplete to adequately capture an individual 's wishes , and that they focus too much on the needs of medical and legal practitioners to the exclusion of the needs of patients .
Advance directive documents are increasingly available online .
Some legal commentators have suggested that using a non - statutory advance directive will leave the user with a document that may not be honored .
However , legal counsel for the Hastings Center for Bioethics refute this assertion .
To make the best choice , individuals should consider reviewing several document styles to ensure that they complete the document that best meets their personal needs .
LEGAL SITUATION
BY COUNTRY Section::::Legal situation by country .
Note : Some of the countries listed below are in the European Union , where legal systems may vary considerably from those in the U.S. Country reports on advance directives is a 2008 paper summarizing advance health care legislation in the European Union with a shorter summary for the U.S. ; a 2009 paper also provides a European overview .
AUSTRALIA Section::::Australia .
The laws regarding advance directives , powers of attorney , and enduring guardianships vary from state to state .
In Queensland , for example , the concept of an advance health directive is defined in the Powers of attorney act of 1998 and Guardianship and Administration act of 2000 .
Tasmania has no specific legislation concerning advance healthcare directives .
CANADA Section::::Canada .
Health Canada – Canada 's federal health agency – has acknowledged the need for a greater investment in palliative and hospice care as the country faces a rapidly growing population of elderly and terminally ill citizens .
Much of the current focus in Canada is on advance care planning which involves encouraging individuals to reflect on and express their wishes for future care , including end - of - life care , before they become terminally ill or incapable of making decisions for themselves .
A number of publicly funded initiatives exist to promote advance care planning and to encourage people to appoint " substitute decision makers " who make medical decisions and can give or withhold consent for medical procedures according to the patient 's pre - expressed wishes when the patient becomes incapable of doing so themselves
In 2008 , The Advance Care Planning in Canada : A National Framework and Implementation Project was founded .
The goal was to engage healthcare professionals and educate patients about the importance of advance care planning and end of life care .
Polling indicates that 96 % of Canadians think that having a conversation with a loved one about planning for the end of life is important .
However , the same polls show that only about 13 % have actually done so , or have created an advance care plan for themselves .
A 2014 Ipsos Reid Survey reveals that only about a third of Canadian doctors and nurses working in primary care feel comfortable discussing end of life issues with their patients .
End - of - life issues in Canada have recently been highlighted due to the ongoing related debate about Physician assisted death in Canada .
Former Federal Health Minister Rona Ambrose ( July 15 , 2013 to November 4 , 2015 ) has stated : " I think the starting point for me is that we still do n't have the best elderly care and palliative care yet … So let 's talk about making sure we have the best end - of - life care before we start talking about assisted suicide and euthanasia . "
ENGLAND AND WALES Section::::England and Wales .
In England and Wales , people may make an advance directive or appoint a proxy under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 .
This is only for an advance refusal of treatment for when the person lacks mental capacity ; to be legally binding , the advance decision must be specific about the treatment that is being refused and the circumstances in which the refusal will apply .
To be valid , the person must have been competent and understood the decision when they signed the directive .
Where the patient 's advance decision relates to a refusal of life - prolonging treatment this must be recorded in writing and witnessed .
Any advance refusal is legally binding providing that the patient is an adult , the patient was competent and properly informed when reaching the decision , it is clearly applicable to the present circumstances and there is no reason to believe that the patient has changed his or her mind .
If an advance decision does not meet these criteria but appears to set out a clear indication of the patient 's wishes , it will not be legally binding but should be taken into consideration in determining the patient 's best interests .
In June 2010 , the Wealth Management Solicitors , Moore Blatch , announced that research showed demand for Living Wills had trebled in the two years previous , indicating the rising level of people concerned about the way in which their terminal illness will be managed .
According to the British Government , every adult with mental capacity has the right to agree to or refuse medical treatment .
In order to make their advance wishes clear , people can use a living will , which can include general statements about wishes , which are not legally binding , and specific refusals of treatment called " advance decisions " or " advance directives " .
GERMANY
Section::::Germany .
On 18 June 2009
the Bundestag passed a law on advance directives , applicable since 1 September 2009 .
Such law , based on the principle of the right of self - determination , provides for the assistance of a fiduciary and of the physician .
ITALY Section::::Italy .
On 14 December 2017 , Italian Senate officially approved a law on advance healthcare directive that came into force on 31 January 2018 .
Controversy over end - of - life care emerged in Italy in 2006 , when a terminally ill patient suffering from muscular dystrophy , Piergiorgio Welby , petitioned the courts for removal of his respirator .
Debated in Parliament , no decision was reached .
A doctor eventually honored Welby 's wishes by removing the respirator under sedation .
The physician was initially charged for violating Italy 's laws against euthanasia , but was later cleared .
Further debate ensued after the father of a 38-year - old woman , Eluana Englaro , petitioned the courts for permission to withdraw feeding tubes to allow her to die .
Englaro had been in a coma for 17 years , following a car accident .
After petitioning the courts for 10 years , authorization was granted and Englaro died in February 2009 .
In May 2008 , apparently as a result of the recent Court of Cassation 's holding in the case of Englaro , a guardianship judge in Modena , Italy used relatively new legislation to work around the lack of the advance directive legislation .
The new law permitted a judicially appointed guardian ( " amministratore di sostegno " ) to make decisions for an individual .
Faced with a 70-year - old woman with end - stage Lou Gehrig 's Disease who was petitioning the court ( with the support of her family ) to prevent any later use of a respirator , the judge appointed her husband as guardian with the specific duty to refuse any tracheotomy and/or respirator use if / when the patient became unable to refuse such treatment herself .
THE NETHERLANDS Section::::The Netherlands .
In the Netherlands , patients and potential patients can specify the circumstances under which they would want euthanasia for themselves .
They do this by providing a written euthanasia directive .
This helps establish the previously expressed wish of the patient even if the patient is no longer able to communicate .
However , it is only one of the factors that is taken into account .
Apart from the will in writing of the patients , at least two physicians , the second being totally unrelated to the first physician in a professional matter ( e.g. working in another hospital , no prior knowledge of the medical case at hand ) , have to agree that the patient is terminally ill and that no hope for recovery exists .
SWITZERLAND
Section::::Switzerland .
In Switzerland , there are several organizations which take care of registering patient decrees , forms which are signed by the patients declaring that in case of permanent loss of judgement ( e.g. , inability to communicate or severe brain damage ) all means of prolonging life shall be stopped .
Family members and these organizations also keep proxies which entitle their holder to enforce such patient decrees .
Establishing such decrees is relatively uncomplicated .
However , in Switzerland , a patient decree has , as of November 2008 , no legally binding effects , whether concerning civil or criminal aspects .
Such a decree is today merely viewed as representing the supposed will of the person with the incapability .
There is , however , a revision of the Swiss Civil Code under way that aims to change this situation ( intended to be article 360 of the Swiss Civil Code ) by making the patient decree a legally binding document .
UNITED STATES Section::::United States .
Aggressive medical intervention leaves nearly two million Americans confined to nursing homes , and over 1.4 million Americans remain so medically frail as to survive only through the use of feeding tubes .
Of U.S. deaths , 25–55 % occur in health care facilities .
As many as 30,000 persons are kept alive in comatose and permanently vegetative states .
Cost burdens to individuals and families are considerable .
A national study found that : " In 20 % of cases , a family member had to quit work ; " 31 % lost " all or most savings " ( even though 96 % had insurance ) ; and " 20 % reported loss of [ their ] major source of income . "
Yet , studies indicate that 70 - 95 % of people would rather refuse aggressive medical treatment than have their lives medically prolonged in incompetent or other poor prognosis states .
As more and more Americans experienced the burdens and diminishing benefits of invasive and aggressive medical treatment in poor prognosis states – either directly ( themselves ) or through a loved one – pressure began to mount to devise ways to avoid the suffering and costs associated with treatments one did not want in personally untenable situations .
The first formal response was the living will .
In the United States , all states recognize some form of living wills or the designation of a health care proxy .
The term living will is not officially recognized under California law , but an advance health care directive or durable power of attorney may be used for the same purpose as a living will .
A " report card " issued by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in 2002 concluded that only seven states deserved an " A " for meeting the standards of the model Uniform Rights of the Terminally Ill Act .
Surveys show that one - third of Americans say they have had to make decisions about end - of - life care for a loved one .
In Pennsylvania on November 30 , 2006 , Governor Edward Rendell signed into law Act 169 ,
that provides a comprehensive statutory framework governing advance health care directives and health care decision - making for incompetent patients .
As a result , health care organizations make available a " Combined Living Will & Health Care Power of Attorney Example Form from Pennsylvania Act 169 of 2006 . "
Several states offer living will " registries " where citizens can file their living will so that they are more easily and readily accessible by doctors and other health care providers .
However , in recent years some of these registries , such as the one run by the Washington State Department of Health , have been shuttered by the state government because of low enrollment , lack of funds , or both .
On July 28 , 2009 , Barack Obama became the first United States President to announce publicly that he had a living will , and to encourage others to do the same .
He told an AARP town meeting , " So I actually think it 's a good idea to have a living will .
I 'd encourage everybody to get one .
I have one ; Michelle has one .
And we hope we do n't have to use it for a long time , but I think it 's something that is sensible .
"
The announcement followed controversy surrounding proposed health care legislation that included language that would permit the payment of doctors under Medicare to counsel patients regarding living wills , sometimes referred to as the " infamous " page 425 .
Shortly afterwards , bioethicist Jacob Appel issued a call to make living wills mandatory .
INDIA Section::::India .
Indian Supreme Court on March 9 , 2018 permitted living wills and passive euthanasia .
The country 's apex court held that the right to a dignified life extends up to the point of having a dignified death .
