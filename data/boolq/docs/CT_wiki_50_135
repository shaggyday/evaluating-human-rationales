ALCOHOL TOLERANCE
Alcohol tolerance refers to the bodily responses to the functional effects of ethanol in alcoholic beverages .
This includes direct tolerance , speed of recovery from insobriety and resistance to the development of alcoholism .
CONSUMPTION - INDUCED TOLERANCE Section::::Consumption - induced tolerance .
Alcohol tolerance is increased by regular drinking .
This reduced sensitivity requires that higher quantities of alcohol be consumed in order to achieve the same effects as before tolerance was established .
Alcohol tolerance may lead to ( or be a sign of ) alcohol dependency .
Heavy alcohol consumption over a period of years can lead to " reverse tolerance " .
A liver can be damaged by chronic alcohol use , leading to a buildup of fat and scar tissue .
The reduced ability of such a liver to metabolize or break down alcohol means that small amounts can lead to a high blood alcohol concentration ( BAC ) and more rapid intoxication .
PHYSIOLOGY OF ALCOHOL TOLERANCE Section::::Physiology of alcohol tolerance .
Direct alcohol tolerance is largely dependent on body size .
Large - bodied people will require more alcohol to reach insobriety than lightly built people .
Thus men , being larger than women on average , will have a higher alcohol tolerance .
The alcohol tolerance is also connected with activity of alcohol dehydrogenases ( a group of enzymes responsible for the breakdown of alcohol ) in the liver , and in the bloodstream .
High level of alcohol dehydrogenase activity results in fast transformation of ethanol to more toxic acetaldehyde .
Such atypical alcohol dehydrogenase levels are less frequent in alcoholics than in nonalcoholics .
Furthermore , among alcoholics , the carriers of this atypical enzyme consume lower ethanol doses , compared to the individuals without the allele .
An estimated one
out of twenty people have an alcohol flush reaction .
It is not in any way an indicator for the drunkenness of an individual .
A mild flushing reaction occurs when the body metabolizes alcohol more quickly into acetaldehyde , a toxic metabolite .
A more severe flushing reaction occurs when the body metabolizes the acetaldehyde more slowly , generally due to an inactive aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme .
Both of those conditions -- faster conversion of alcohol to acetaldehyde and slower removal of acetaldehyde -- reduce the risk for excessive drinking and alcohol dependence .
ALCOHOL TOLERANCE IN DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUPS
Section::::Alcohol tolerance in different ethnic groups .
To engage in alcohol consumption and development of alcoholism appear to be common to primates , and is not a specific human phenomenon .
Humans have access to alcohol on far greater quantity than non - human primates , and the availability increased particularly with the development of agriculture .
The tolerance to alcohol is not equally distributed throughout the world 's population .
Genetics of alcohol dehydrogenase indicate resistance has arisen independently in different cultures .
In North America , Native Americans have the highest probability of developing alcoholism compared to Europeans and Asians .
Different alcohol tolerance also exists within Asian groups , such as between Chinese and Koreans .
The health benefit of a modest alcohol consumption reported in people of European descent appear not to exist among people of African descent .
Higher body masses and the prevalence of high levels of alcohol dehydrogenase in an individual increase alcohol tolerance , and both adult weight and enzymes vary with ethnicity .
Not all differences in tolerance can be traced to biochemistry however .
Differences in tolerance levels are also influenced by socio - economic and cultural difference including diet , average body weight and patterns of consumption .
