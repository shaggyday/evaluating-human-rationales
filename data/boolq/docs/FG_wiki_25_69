OPTOUTPRESCREEN.COM
Optoutprescreen.com is a joint venture among Equifax , Experian , Innovis , and TransUnion , allowing customers to opt out of receiving credit card solicitations by mail .
Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) , consumer reporting agencies are permitted to include customers ' names on lists used by creditors or insurers to make offers of credit or insurance that are not initiated by the customer .
The FCRA also provides customers the right to opt out , which prevents consumer reporting agencies from providing credit file information to others .
Beginning on August 1 , 2005 ,
the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 took effect , which amended the FCRA to require consumer reporting agencies to include in their credit offers a statement allowing customers to stop unsolicited offers either by phone ( 1 - 888 - 5OPTOUT or 1 - 888 - 567 - 8688 ) or via https://www.optoutprescreen.com .
The Optoutprescreen.com is not accessible by users of ISPs located outside the United States and the U.S. Territories .
Customers may opt out from receiving offers for either five years or permanently .
To opt out permanently , customers must confirm their requests in writing , by mailing in a Permanent Opt - Out Election form , available through the website .
Customers who have opted out will no longer be included in offer lists provided by consumer reporting agencies .
Customers who have previously completed an opt - out request may request to opt back in at the website as well .
