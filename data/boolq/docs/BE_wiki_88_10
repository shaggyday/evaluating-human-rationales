KING OF EGYPT King of Egypt ( ) was the title used by the ruler of Egypt between 1922 and 1951 .
When the United Kingdom ended its protectorate over Egypt on 28 February 1922 , Egypt 's Sultan Fouad I issued a decree on 15 March 1922 whereby he adopted the title of King of Egypt .
It has been reported that the title change was due not only to Egypt 's newly independent status , but also to Fouad
I 's desire to be accorded the same title as the newly installed rulers of the newly created kingdoms of Hejaz , Syria and Iraq .
The only other monarch to be styled King of Egypt was Fouad
I 's son Farouk I , whose title was changed to King of Egypt and the Sudan in October 1951 following the Wafdist government 's unilateral abrogation of the Anglo - Egyptian Treaty of 1936 .
The monarchy was abolished on 18 June 1953 following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 and the establishment of a republic .
The then - king , the infant Fuad II of Egypt ( Farouk having abdicated following the revolution ) , went into exile in Switzerland .
The rulers of Ancient Egypt may be described using the title King ( a translation of the Egyptian word nsw ) or Pharaoh ( derived from pr Ë¤3 ) .
