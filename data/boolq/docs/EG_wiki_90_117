TRANSIENT LINGUAL PAPILLITIS Transient lingual papillitis ( also termed fungiform papillary glossitis , eruptive lingual papillitis , or colloquially , lie bumps ) , are painful , hypertrophic , red and white papillae on the tongue .
CAUSE Section::::Cause .
The name " lie bumps " is a result of a myth that telling lies would cause them .
However , very little has been written about this condition in scientific articles or textbooks and scientific studies have failed to produce a definite cause .
Possible causes include : " stress , gastrointestinal upset , menstruation , acidic or sour food , smoking , and local trauma " ( direct physical irritation ) of the tongue .
Lie bumps are often caused by the taste bud(s ) splitting .
These bumps are small , white bumps on the base of the tongue .
They are likely to be the result of transient lingual papillitis ( TLP ) .
This condition is limited to the upper ( dorsal ) surface of the tongue , affecting some of the tiny bumps on the tongue known as the fungiform papillae , what we commonly call the " taste buds . "
TLP is a harmless problem .
These bumps can become notably red or white and are quite tender for up to several days .
While the cause of TLP is not known with certainty , most experts feel that local accidental trauma ( rubbing , scraping or biting ) is a major factor ; however , contact reactions to things like certain foods have also been suggested .
Lie bumps are not contagious and the discomfort is relatively minor .
Typically these lesions heal within a few days with no treatment , though a doctor may refer a patient to an oral pathologist in prolonged cases .
DIAGNOSIS TREATMENTS Section::::Treatments .
There are no specific treatments for this problem , other than using ice or numbing medicines to ease the pain .
