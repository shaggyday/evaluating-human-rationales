Macau is not a sovereign nation .
It is one of the two Special Administrative Regions of the People 's Republic of China ( the other being Anglophone Hong Kong , a former British colony ) .
* * Equatorial Guinea adopted Portuguese as one of its official languages in 2007 , being admitted to CPLP in 2014 .
The use of the Portuguese language in this country is limited .
However , a Portuguese - based creole language , Annobonese Creole , is used , mainly on islands of Annobon and Bioko .
* * 15 % of Uruguay 's population speaks Portuguese ( in the northern areas closer to Brazil ) as a native language but it is not an official language in any capacity .
A similar blending of Portuguese , Spanish , and Guarani ( Jopara ) occurs along the border with Paraguay .
* SPREAD OF PORTUGUESE Section::::Spread of Portuguese .
During a period of Portuguese discoveries and through a large colonial empire , the language was spread to areas in Africa , Asia and the Americas .
Portuguese - based creole languages also developed during this era .
Today , Portuguese continues to thrive outside the Lusophone world through the presence of large expat communities of Brazilians , Portuguese , Cape Verdeans , and found throughout the world .
EUROPE PORTUGAL Section::::Europe .
Section::::Portugal .
Portuguese is spoken as a first language in Portugal by nearly all of the nation 's 10.6 million people .
The ancestor of modern Portuguese , Galician - Portuguese , began developing in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula , in an area encompassing present - day northern - Portugal and Galicia , at around the 9th century .
Modern Portuguese started developing in the early 16th century .
REST OF EUROPE Section::::Rest of Europe .
The Galician language , spoken natively in Galicia , Spain , is a dialect of Portuguese , according to many linguists , which makes northwestern Spain a lusophone region .
Portuguese - speaking immigrants from Portugal , Brazil , Portuguese - speaking Africa and Macau have also settled in Andorra ( around 15 000 speakers ) , Belgium , France ( around 500 000 speakers ) , Germany , Luxembourg , Spain , Switzerland , and the United Kingdom .
In Luxembourg , 19 % of the population speaks Portuguese as mother tongue , making it the largest minority language by percentage in a Western European country .
AMERICAS BRAZIL Section::::Americas .
Section::::Brazil .
With a population of over 205 million , Brazil is by far the world 's largest Portuguese - speaking nation and the only one in the Americas .
Portuguese was introduced during the Portuguese colonial period .
Portuguese has also served as a lingua franca between the various ethnic groups in Brazil and the native Amerindian population after the Jesuits were expelled from every Portuguese territory and the languages associated with them prohibited .
Portuguese is the first language of the overwhelming majority of Brazilians , at 99.5 % .
It is followed by various German dialects , such as Riograndenser Hunsrückisch , at a distant 1.94 % ( co - official status ) .
The form of Portuguese spoken in Brazil is a little different from that spoken in Europe , with differences in vocabulary and grammar that can be compared to the differences between American and British English , but with the phonology and prosody more distinct to each other ( on a slightly larger scale than that of the Metropolitan and Québécois varieties of French ) ; nevertheless , European and Brazilian Portuguese are completely mutually intelligible .
The vast majority of Brazilian characteristics are also found in some rural , remote Portuguese registers ( or the African and Asian ones , indicating an Old Portuguese feature lost in Europe ) , while nearly all distinctive European characteristics can be found in any major dialect of Brazil ( such as fluminense , specially its carioca sociolect , and florianopolitano ) , due to a stronger or more recent Portuguese and other European immigration .
Migration from Brazil also led to a great number of Portuguese speakers in the Southern Cone ( especially Uruguay with portunhol da pampa ) , Paraguay ( see brasiguayos ) , other regions of South America ( especially Bolivia ) except Venezuela , Japan ( see Brazilians in Japan 400,000 and dekasegi , official numbers do not include second generation Portuguese speakers and naturalized citizens ) , South Korea , the Philippines ( see Brazilians in the Philippines ) , and Israel ( see Aliyah from Latin America in the 2000s ) .
REST OF SOUTH AMERICA Section::::Rest of South America .
Although Brazil is the only Portuguese - speaking nation in South America , it has the largest population , area and economy on the continent .
Thus , the South American trade bloc Mercosul uses Portuguese alongside Spanish as its working languages .
A Spanish influenced Portuguese dialect is spoken in the northern Uruguayan border area with Brazil .
Given the proximity and trading relations between Portuguese speaking Brazil , and its respective Spanish speaking nations , Portuguese is offered as a foreign ( or obligatory ) second language course at most schools in Uruguay , Argentina , Paraguay , Venezuela and Bolivia .
In Venezuela and Guyana , there are communities of Portuguese immigrants ( mostly Madeirans ) and their descendants who speak Portuguese as their native language .
NORTH AMERICA Section::::North America .
There are more than 1.5 million Portuguese Americans and about 300,000 Brazilian Americans living in the United States , and Portuguese is spoken by over 730,000 people at home in the country .
There are over 500,000 people of Portuguese descent living in Canada ; however , most of the community 's population now speaks English or French as their primary language .
Also a primary language along with English in the British Overseas Territory of Bermuda .
AFRICA ANGOLA Section::::Africa .

A Portuguese creole is spoken by locals on the island of Annobón .
In 2007 , President Teodoro Obiang Nguema announced a decision to make Portuguese the third official language of the country after Spanish and French .
This was in an effort by the government to improve its communications , trade , and bilateral relations with Portuguese - speaking countries .
Despite government promotions , Portuguese remains rarely spoken in Equatorial Guinea , but increased political and trade relations with Portuguese - speaking nations i.e. , Brazil , Angola , Portugal , will soon increase the numbers of Portuguese speakers in this country .
News , sports , and entertainment media in Portuguese will undoubtedly also facilitate increased comprehension .
The majority of the population ( ~90 % ) still speaks Spanish as its primary language , and Spanish is still the administrative language and that of education , while French is the second official language .
REST OF AFRICA Section::::Rest of Africa .
Large Portuguese - speaking communities are found in Namibia , South Africa and Zambia due to immigration from the Lusophone African countries .

and number is steadily growing .
It is believed that Portuguese will be the primary language of East Timor in as few as 5 to 10 years .
The local Tetum language has been heavily influenced by Portuguese through loanwords , and code - switching between the two languages is common .
MACAU
Section::::Macau .
Due to the one country , two systems policy of China regarding its special administrative regions , Macau is able to retain Portuguese as an official language alongside Cantonese .
Portuguese was first introduced to Macau when Portuguese traders established a permanent settlement there in 1537 .
Despite being a Portuguese colony for over four centuries , the Portuguese language was never widely spoken in Macau and remained limited to administration and higher education and was spoken primarily by the Portuguese colonists , Macanese people of mixed ancestry , and elites and middle - class people of pure Chinese blood .
As a consequence , when Macau was handed back to China in 1999 , Portuguese did not have a strong presence like English had in Hong Kong and continued its decline which began when Portuguese rule was still occurring .
It was only after Portuguese rule ended when the Portuguese language in Macau began to see an increase in speakers due to China 's increased trading relations with Lusophone countries .
There has been an increase in the teaching of Portuguese owing to the growing trade links between China and lusophone nations such as Portugal , Brazil , Angola , Mozambique , and East Timor , with 5,000 students learning the language .
Today , about 3 % of Macau 's population speaks Portuguese as a first language and 7 % of the population professes fluency .
A Portuguese creole called Macanese ( Patuá ) was spoken by Macanese of mixed ancestry but is near extinction today .
GOA ( INDIA ) Section::::Goa ( India ) .
Portuguese is present in the enclave of Goa , which was a Portuguese colony until 1961 .
Although it was the sole official language during Portuguese colonial rule , it is mostly spoken by the elderly and educated populations today and is not an official language .
Rather , Goa 's official state language is Konkani , which has however picked up some Portuguese vocabulary as a legacy of Portuguese influence .
Attempts to make Konkani be written in the Portuguese alphabet and possibilities of reintroducing Portuguese as a co - official language of Goa have been made in recent years ; presently Portuguese is officially teaching there .
Portuguese rule in Daman and Diu has also left a smaller Portuguese influence on the territory .
A Portuguese - based creole called Língua da Casa is spoken in the territory .
As a result of the renewed interest in the Portuguese language and culture , the Portuguese language is making an impressive comeback .
Portuguese is still taught in some schools in Goa .
Portuguese were also in the area of Vasai ( present ) , previously Bassein or Bacaim since 1560 until 1739 .
Though the Portuguese were defeated by Marathas , there are some words which are used by the locals which are words in the Portuguese language .
Today there is a large Catholic population , and many churches built during those days are still being used for worship .
REST OF ASIA Section::::Rest of Asia .
Portuguese is spoken in Japan among returned immigrants ( 500,000 ) or migrant workers from Brazil known as dekasegi .
Portuguese loanwords are also present in the Japanese language due to trading relations between Japan and the Portuguese Empire in the 16th century .
Portuguese is now part of the curriculum in many Japanese schools , and many radio and television stations are broadcast exclusively in the Portuguese language .
In Malacca , Malaysia , a Portuguese creole known as Papiá Kristang or Cristão is still spoken by some of the Eurasian population .
