CAT ( ZODIAC )
The Cat is the fourth animal symbol in the 12-year cycle of the Vietnamese zodiac and Gurung zodiac , taking place of the Rabbit in the Chinese zodiac .
As such , the traits associated with the Rabbit are attributed to the cat .
Cats are in conflict with the Rat .
Legends relating to the order of the Chinese zodiac often include stories as to why the cat was not included among the twelve .
Because the Rat tricked the cat into missing the banquet with the Jade Emperor , the cat was not included and was not aware that the banquet was going on and was not given a year , thus began the antipathy between cats and Rats .
It is possible domesticated cats had not proliferated through China at the zodiac 's induction .
Another legend known as " The Great Race " tells that all the animals in the zodiac were headed to the Jade Emperor .
The Cat and Rat were the most intelligent of the animals , however they were both also poor swimmers and came across a river .
They both tricked the kind , naive Ox to assist them by letting them ride on its back over the river .
As the Ox was approaching the other side of the river , the Rat pushed the Cat into the river and jumped off the Ox and rushed to the Jade Emperor , becoming the first in the zodiac .
All the other animals made it to the Jade Emperor , while the Cat was left to drown in the river after being sabotaged by the Rat .
It is said that this is the reason cats always hunt Rats .
There have been various explanations of why the Vietnamese , unlike all other countries who follow the Sino lunar calendar , have the cat instead of the Rabbit as a zodiac animal .
The most common explanation is that the ancient word for Rabbit ( Mao ) sounds like cat ( Meo ) .
