CONTROLLER
Xbox
One Wireless Controller is the primary controller for the Microsoft Xbox One console .
The controller maintains the overall layout found in the Xbox 360 controller , but with various tweaks to its design , such as a revised shape , redesigned analog sticks , shoulder buttons , and triggers , along with new rumble motors within the triggers to allow for directional haptic feedback .
It has had three revisions with several changes to the controller 's design and functionality .
Microsoft also markets the Elite Wireless Controller , a premium version geared towards professional gamers , including interchangeable parts and programmability features .
In turn , each of the aforementioned variations has been offered in various color schemes , some featuring special designs tying into specific games .
Per a partnership between Microsoft and Oculus VR , Xbox One controllers are bundled with the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset .
DESIGN Section::::Design .
Microsoft invested over $ 100 million into refining the controller design for the Xbox One ; internal designers had created prototypes with various tweaks and refinements to the design over the Xbox 360 controller , along with those including unorthodox features such as embedded screens and speakers ( which were rejected due to their effects on battery life , and redundancy to the main display and sound system ) , and the ability to emit odors .
The Xbox One controller maintains the overall layout found in the Xbox 360 's design , but with enhancements such as redesigned grips , a smoother build , the removal of the protruding battery compartment , and " Menu " and " View " buttons replacing " Start " and " Back " .
The controller also contains light emitters that allow it to be tracked and paired using Kinect sensor , and to detect when it is not being held to automatically enter a low - power state .
The controller contains a micro USB port , enabling wired use of the controller with the console or on computers running Windows 7 or later with drivers , and firmware updates .
For communication , the controller uses a new proprietary protocol with a larger amount of bandwidth than the wireless protocol used by the Xbox 360 controller , reducing wireless latency and allowing higher quality headset audio .
The analog sticks feature a new textured rim , while the D - pad was changed to use a more traditional 4-way design rather than the circular 8-way design of the 360 .
This change was made partially due to criticism by players of fighting games who , despite the use of " sweeps " across the D - pad in these games as motivation , felt that the Xbox 360 's D - pad performed poorly in said fighting games .
The updated 4-way design is also better suited for use as individual keys in games that use them for item selection .
The design of the face buttons was revised to improve their legibility , using a three - layer design consisting of a black background , colored letter , and a clear covering intended to make the letter appear to " hover " inside it .
The buttons themselves are also spaced slightly closer together .
The bumpers and trigger buttons were overhauled with a new curved shape to improve their ergonomics , as the user 's fingers now naturally lie at an angle upon them unlike the straighter design on Xbox 360 controllers .
The bumpers were also made flush with the triggers .
The triggers themselves now have a smoother feel , and were made more accurate .
Each trigger features independent rumble motors called " Impulse Triggers " , which allows developers to program directional vibration .
One trigger can be made to vibrate when firing a gun , or both can work together to create feedback that indicates the direction of an incoming hit .
LAYOUT Section::::Layout .
A standard Xbox One controller features ten digital buttons , a syncing button , two analog triggers , two analog sticks and a digital D - pad .
The right face of the controller features four digital actions buttons ; a green " A " button , red " B " button , blue " X " button , and yellow " Y " button .
The lower right houses the right analog stick , in lower left is a digital D - pad and on the left face is the left analog stick .
Both analog sticks can also be " clicked in " to activate a digital button beneath .
In the center of the controller face are digital " View " , " Menu " and " Guide " buttons .
The " Guide " button is labelled with the Xbox logo , and is used to turn on the console / controller and to access the Dashboard .
Unlike the Xbox 360 controller , the Xbox One controller features a white backlit
Xbox logo on its guide button and does not feature the " ring of light " that served as an indicator for the controller 's assigned number ( 1 to 4 ) .
The left and right " shoulders " each feature a digital shoulder button , or " bumper " , and an analog trigger .
