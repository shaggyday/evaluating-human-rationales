GUERNSEY POUND
The pound is the currency of Guernsey .
Since 1921 , Guernsey has been in currency union with the United Kingdom and the Guernsey pound is not a separate currency but is a local issue of banknotes and coins denominated in pound sterling , in a similar way to the banknotes issued in Scotland , England and Northern Ireland ( see Banknotes of the pound sterling ) .
It can be exchanged at par with other sterling coinage and notes ( see also sterling zone ) .
For this reason , ISO 4217 does not include a separate currency code for the Guernsey pound , but where a distinct code is desired GGP is generally used .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Until the early 19th century , Guernsey used predominantly French currency .
Coins of the French livre were legal tender until 1834 , with French francs used until 1921 .
In 1830 , Guernsey began production of copper coins denominated in doubles .
The double was worth of a French franc .
The name " double " derived from the French " double deniers " , although the value of the coin was equal to the liard ( three - denier piece ) still circulating .
Coins were issued in denominations of 1 , 2 , 4 and 8 doubles .
The 8 double coin was a " Guernsey penny " , with twelve to the " Guernsey shilling " ( worth 1.2 francs ) .
However , this shilling was not equal to the British shilling ( worth 1.26 francs , as the exchange rate according to the respective gold standards was 25.22 francs = 1 pound sterling ) .
Banknotes were also produced by the States of Guernsey from 1827 , denominated in pounds .
In 1848 , an ordinance was passed that the pound sterling should be legal tender at a value of £ 1 1s 3d ( 2040 doubles ) .
This was rescinded two years later and French currency , supplemented by local issues , continued to circulate .
In 1870 , British coins were made legal tender , with the British shilling circulating at 12½ Guernsey pence .
Bank of England notes became legal tender in 1873 .
In 1914 , new banknotes appeared , some of which carried denominations in Guernsey shillings and francs .
After the First World War , the value of the franc began to fall relative to sterling .
This caused Guernsey to adopt a pound equal to the pound sterling in 1921 .
For amounts below 1 shilling , the conversion rate of 1 Guernsey penny ( 8 doubles ) = 1 British penny applied , allowing the Guernsey coins to continue to circulate .
For amounts above 1 shilling , an exchange rate of 21 Guernsey shillings to the pound sterling was used , applying an approximation to the pre - war exchange rate of 25.2 francs = 1 pound sterling , rather than the exact rate of 25.22 .
This conversion increased the value of the double from to of a pound .
The World War
I issues of banknotes were overstamped with the word " British " to indicate this change .
New banknotes and British silver coinage circulated alongside the double coins , with 3-pence coins minted specially for Guernsey from 1956 .
In 1971 , along with the rest of the British Isles , Guernsey decimalised , with the pound subdivided into 100 pence , and began issuing a full range of coin denominations from ½p to 50p ( £ 1 and £ 2 coins followed later ) .
LEGAL TENDER
Section::::Legal tender .
The Guernsey pound , and other notes denominated in pound sterling ( including those issued by the Bank of England , Scottish , Manx and Northern Irish notes and the Jersey pound ) may be used in Guernsey .
The Guernsey pound is legal tender only in the Bailiwick of Guernsey although it also circulates freely in Jersey but can not be used in the UK .
It can also be exchanged in other places at banks and bureaux de change .
COINS Section::::Coins .
Between 1830 and 1956 , Guernsey 's four coin denominations , 1 , 2 , 4 and 8 doubles , all carried very similar designs , with the Island 's arms and name ( spelled " Guernesey " ) on the obverse and the denomination and date on the reverse .
In addition , the 8 double coins featured a wreath on both sides .
In 1956 , new designs were introduced for the 4 and 8 doubles ( the lower denominations were no longer issued ) .
These featured the Island 's seal and name ( now given as S'Ballivie Insule de Gernereve ) on the obverse with the English name , the date and the Guernsey lily on the reverse .
Threepence coins were also issued from 1956 , with the same obverse and a reverse featuring the Guernsey cow .
As in the UK , 5- and 10-new - pence coins were introduced in 1968 , followed by 50-new - pence coins in 1969 , before decimalisation took place in 1971 and the ½- , 1- and 2-new - pence coins were introduced .
These coins were the same size and composition as the corresponding British coins .
The word " new " was dropped in 1977 .
The £ 1 coin was introduced in 1981 , two years before its introduction in the UK , although the 20-pence and £ 2 coins were introduced at the same time as in the UK : 1982 and 1998 , respectively .
The thickness of the 1981 coin was significantly thinner than the modern version and the diameter also measured slightly less .
The 1-pound coin ceased to be legal tender on 15 October 2017 to coincide with the withdrawal of the circular £ 1 coin in the UK .
The UK 's new twelve - sided £ 1 coin will be the only £ 1 coin that is legal tender on the island .
The first decimal issues continued with the same obverse as the last pre - decimal issues until 1985 , when Raphael Maklouf 's portrait of Queen Elizabeth II was added .
Ian Rank - Broadley 's portrait of the Queen has appeared since 1998 .

In 1827 , the States of Guernsey introduced one - pound notes , with the Guernsey Banking Company and the Guernsey Commercial Banking Company also issuing one - pound notes from 1861 and 1886 , respectively .
The commercial banks lost their right to issue notes in 1914 , although the notes circulated until 1924 .
Also in 1914 , the States introduced five- and ten - shilling notes , also denominated as 6 and 12 francs .
In 1921 , States notes were over - stamped with the word " British " to signify the island 's conversion to a pound equal to sterling .
From 1924 , ten - shilling notes were issued without any reference to the franc .
The five - shilling note was discontinued .
In 1941 , during the German occupation , notes were introduced in denominations of 6 pence , 1 shilling 3 pence , 2 shillings 6 pence and 5 shillings .
The first to be issued were the 5-shilling and 2/6 notes .
They were printed on States of Guernsey watermarked paper ; the height of the notes was 2⅜ inches ; the length of the 2/6 note was 3⅝ inches and that of the 5/- note was 2¾ inches .
The 5/- note was printed in black and red with the Seal of the Bailiwick in red on the reverse .
The 2/6 note was printed in light blue with the denomination in orange and the Seal of the Bailiwick in royal blue on the reverse .
From 1942 , the 1-shilling , 3-pence notes were overprinted to produce 1-shilling notes .
In 1945 , following liberation , 5-pound notes were introduced and production of all denominations below 10 shillings ended .
The 10 shilling note was replaced by the 50-new - pence coin in the run up to decimalisation .
Ten - pound notes were introduced in 1975 , followed by 20 pounds in 1980 and 50 pounds in 1994 .
Although 1- and 2-pound coins have been introduced , the 1-pound note still circulates .
A commemorative 20-pound note was issued in 2012 to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II .
It is similar to the regular issue , but with the QE60 letter prefix , the commemorative laurel wreath on the lower left corner of the note , and additional wording .
A total of 150,000 notes were issued .
A commemorative one - pound note was issued on 4 July 2013 to mark 200 years since the first commercial operation of Thomas De La Rue .
The commemorative note is in circulation alongside the standard one - pound note , differing in the portrait of De La Rue on the reverse and a TDLR letter prefix .
On November 8 , 2018 , a commemorative banknote of 20-pounds was issued to mark the 100th Anniversary of the end of World War I.
It is like the preceding 2012 commemorative issue , but with the seal of the Bailiwick of Guernsey surrounded by poppy flowers and containing the serial letter prefix " TG / W " ( for " The Great War " ) . !
