PRESIDENT
The president is a common title for the head of state in most republics .
In politics , president is a title given to leaders of republican states .
The functions exercised by a president vary according to the form of government .
In parliamentary republics , they are limited to those of the head of state , and are thus largely ceremonial .
In presidential and semi - presidential republics , the role of the president is more prominent , encompassing also ( in most cases )
the functions of the head of government .
In authoritarian regimes , a dictator or leader of a one - party state may also be called a president .
DESCRIPTION Section::::Description .
The title president is derived from the Latin prae- " before " + sedere " to sit . "
As such , it originally designated the officer who presides over or " sits before " a gathering and ensures that debate is conducted according to the rules of order ( see also chairman and speaker ) , but today it most commonly refers to an executive official in any social organization .
Early examples are from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge ( from 1464 ) and the founding President of the Royal Society William Brouncker in 1660 .
This usage survives today in the title of such offices as " President of the Board of Trade " and " Lord President of the Council " in the United Kingdom , as well as " President of the Senate " in the United States ( one of the roles constitutionally assigned to the vice president ) .
The officiating priest at certain Anglican religious services , too , is sometimes called the " president " in this sense .
However , the most common modern usage is as the title of a head of state in a republic .
In pre - revolutionary France , the president of a Parlement evolved into a powerful magistrate , a member of the so - called noblesse de robe ( " nobility of the gown " ) , with considerable judicial as well as administrative authority .
The name referred to his primary role of presiding over trials and other hearings .
In the 17th and 18th centuries , seats in the Parlements , including presidencies , became effectively hereditary , since the holder of the office could ensure that it would pass to an heir by paying the crown a special tax known as the paulette .
The post of " first president " ( premier président ) , however , could only be held by the King 's nominees .
The Parlements were abolished by the French Revolution .
In modern France the chief judge of a court is known as its president ( président de la cour ) .
The first usage of the word president to denote the highest official in a government was during the Commonwealth of England .
After the abolition of the monarchy the English Council of State , whose members were elected by the House of Commons , became the executive government of the Commonwealth .
The Council of State was the successor of the Privy Council , which had previously been headed by the Lord President ; its successor the Council of State was also headed by a Lord President , the first of which was John Bradshaw .
However , the Lord President alone was not head of state , because that office was vested in the council as a whole .
The modern usage of the term president to designate a single person who is the head of state of a republic can be traced directly to the United States Constitution of 1787 , which created the office of President of the United States .
Previous American governments had included " presidents " ( such as the president of the Continental Congress or the president of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress ) , but these were presiding officers in the older sense , with no executive authority .
It has been suggested that the executive use of the term was borrowed from early American colleges and universities , which were usually headed by a president .
British universities were headed by an official called the " Chancellor " ( typically a ceremonial position ) while the chief administrator held the title of " Vice - Chancellor " .
But America 's first institutions of higher learning ( such as Harvard University and Yale University ) did n't resemble a full - sized university so much as one of its constituent colleges .
A number of colleges at Cambridge University featured an official called the " president " .
The head , for instance , of Magdalene College , Cambridge was called the master and his second the president .
The first president of Harvard , Henry Dunster , had been educated at Magdalene .
Some have speculated that he borrowed the term out of a sense of humility , considering himself only a temporary place - holder .
The presiding official of Yale College , originally a " rector " ( after the usage of continental European universities ) , became " president " in 1745 .
A common style of address for presidents , " Mr / Mrs .
President , " is borrowed from British Parliamentary tradition , in which the presiding Speaker of the House of Commons is referred to as " Mr / Mrs . Speaker .
" Coincidentally , this usage resembles the older French custom of referring to the president of a parlement as " Monsieur / Madame le Président " , a form of address that in modern France applies to both the President of the Republic and to chief judges .
Similarly , the Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada is addressed by francophone parliamentarians as " Monsieur / Madame le / la Président(e ) " .
In Pierre Choderlos de Laclos 's novel Les Liaisons Dangereuses of 1782 , the character identified as Madame la Présidente de Tourvel ( " Madam President of Tourvel " ) is the wife of a magistrate in a parlement .
The fictional name Tourvel refers not to the parlement in which the magistrate sits , but rather , in imitation of an aristocratic title , to his private estate .
Once the United States adopted the title of " president " for its republican head of state , many other nations followed suit .
Haiti became the first presidential republic in Latin America when Henri Christophe assumed the title in 1807 .
Almost all of the American nations that became independent from Spain in the early 1810s and 1820s chose a US - style president as their chief executive .
The first European president was the president of the Italian Republic of 1802 , a client state of revolutionary France , in the person of Napoleon Bonaparte .
The first African president was the President of Liberia ( 1848 ) , while the first Asian president was the President of the Republic of China ( 1912 ) .
In the twentieth and twenty - first centuries , the powers of presidencies have varied from country to country .
The spectrum of power has included presidents - for - life and hereditary presidencies to ceremonial heads of state .
Presidents in the countries with a democratic or representative form of government are usually elected for a specified period of time and in some cases may be re - elected by the same process by which they are appointed , i.e. in many nations , periodic popular elections .
The powers vested in such presidents vary considerably .
Some presidencies , such as that of Ireland , are largely ceremonial , whereas other systems vest the president with substantive powers such as the appointment and dismissal of prime ministers or cabinets , the power to declare war , and powers of veto on legislation .
In many nations the president is also the commander - in - chief of the nation 's armed forces , though once again this can range from a ceremonial role to one with considerable authority .
PRESIDENTIAL SYSTEMS Section::::Presidential systems .
In almost all states with a presidential system of government , the president exercises the functions of head of state and head of government , i.e. the president directs the executive branch of government .
When a President not only is head of state , but also head of government , is this , in Europe known to be a President of Counsel from the French Présidente du Conseil , used 1871 - 1940 and 1944 - 1958 , as the Third and Fourth French Republics .
In the United States the President has always been both Head of State and Head of Government and has always had the title of President .
Presidents in this system are either directly elected by popular vote or indirectly elected by an electoral college or some other democratically elected body .
In the United States , the President is indirectly elected by the Electoral College made up of electors chosen by voters in the presidential election .
In most states of the United States , each elector is committed to voting for a specified candidate determined by the popular vote in each state , so that the people , in voting for each elector , are in effect voting for the candidate .
However , for various reasons the numbers of electors in favour of each candidate are unlikely to be proportional to the popular vote .
Thus , in five close United States elections ( 1824 , 1876 , 1888 , 2000 , and 2016 ) , the candidate with the most popular votes still lost the election .
In Mexico , the president is directly elected for a six - year term by popular vote .
The candidate who wins the most votes is elected president even without an absolute majority .
The president may never get another term .
The 2006 Mexican elections had a fierce competition , the electoral results showed a minimal difference between the two most voted candidates and such difference was just about the 0.58 % of the total vote .
The Federal Electoral Tribunal declared an elected president after a controversial post - electoral process .
In Brazil , the president is directly elected for a four - year term by popular vote .
A candidate has to have more than 50 % of the valid votes .
If no candidates achieve a majority of the votes , there is a runoff election between the two candidates with most votes .
Again , a candidate needs a majority of the vote to be elected .
In Brazil , a president can not be elected to more than two consecutive terms , but there is no limit on the number of terms a president can serve .
Many South American , Central American , African and some Asian nations follow the presidential model .
SEMI - PRESIDENTIAL SYSTEMS Section::::Semi - presidential systems .
A second system is the semi - presidential system , also known as the French model .
In this system , as in the parliamentary system , there are both a president and a prime minister ; but unlike the parliamentary system , the president may have significant day - to - day power .
For example , in France , when their party controls the majority of seats in the National Assembly , the president can operate closely with the parliament and prime minister , and work towards a common agenda .
When the National Assembly is controlled by their opponents , however , the president can find themselves marginalized with the opposition party prime minister exercising most of the power .
Though the prime minister remains an appointee of the president , the president must obey the rules of parliament , and select a leader from the house 's majority holding party .
Thus , sometimes the president and prime minister can be allies , sometimes rivals ; the latter situation is known in France as cohabitation .
Variants of the French semi - presidential system , developed at the beginning of the Fifth Republic by Charles de Gaulle , are used in France , Portugal , Romania , Taiwan , Sri Lanka and several post - colonial countries which have emulated the French model .
In Finland , although the 2000 constitution moved towards a ceremonial presidency , the system is still formally semi - presidential , with the President of Finland retaining e.g. foreign policy and appointment powers .
PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEMS Section::::Parliamentary systems .
The parliamentary republic , is a parliamentary system in which the presidency is largely ceremonial with either de facto or no significant executive authority ( such as the President of Austria ) or de jure no significant executive power ( such as the President of Ireland ) , and the executive powers rests with the Prime Minister who automatically assumes the post as head of a majority party or coalition , but takes oath of office administered by the president .
However , the president is head of the civil service , commander in chief of the armed forces and in some cases can dissolve parliament .
Countries using this system include Austria , Armenia , Albania , Bangladesh , Czech Republic , Germany , Greece , Hungary , Iceland , India , Ireland , Israel , Italy , Malta , Pakistan , Singapore .
A variation of the parliamentary republic is a system with an executive president in which the president is the head of state and the government but unlike a presidential system , is elected by and accountable to a parliament , and referred to as president .
Countries using this system include Botswana , South Africa and Suriname .
COLLECTIVE PRESIDENCY Section::::Collective presidency .
Only a tiny minority of modern republics do not have a single head of state .
Some examples of this are : * Switzerland , where the headship of state is collectively vested in the seven - member Swiss Federal Council , although there is also a President of the Confederation , who is a member of the Federal Council elected by the Federal Assembly ( the Swiss parliament ) for a year ( constitutional convention mandates that the post rotates every New Year 's Day ) .
*
The Captains Regent of San Marino elected by the Grand and General Council .
*
In the former Soviet Union , while the real power was exercised by the general secretary of the Communist Party , the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet executed powers of collective head of state , and its chairman was often called " president " in the West .
* Yugoslavia after the death of Josip Broz Tito until its breakup .
* Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina
* National Council of Government ( Uruguay )
* Junta of National Reconstruction in Nicaragua DICTATORSHIPS Section::::Dictatorships .
In dictatorships , the title of president is frequently taken by self - appointed or military - backed leaders .
Such is the case in many states :
Idi Amin in Uganda , Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaire , Ferdinand Marcos in Philippines and Saddam Hussein in Iraq are some examples .
Other presidents in authoritarian states have wielded only symbolic or no power such as Craveiro Lopes in Portugal and Joaquín Balaguer under the " Trujillo Era " of the Dominican Republic .
President for Life is a title assumed by some dictators to try to ensure that their authority or legitimacy is never questioned .
Ironically , most leaders who proclaim themselves President for Life do not in fact successfully serve a life term .
On the other hand , presidents like Alexandre Pétion , Rafael Carrera , Josip Broz Tito and François Duvalier died in office .
Kim Il - sung was named Eternal President of the Republic after his death .
In ancient Rome , Lucius Cornelius Sulla appointed himself in 82 BC to an entirely new office , dictator rei publicae constituendae causa ( " dictator for the making of laws and for the settling of the constitution " ) , which was functionally identical to the dictatorate rei gerundae causa ( " for the matter to be done , " e.g. , a military command against a specific enemy ) except that it lacked any set time limit , although Sulla held this office for over two years before he voluntarily abdicated and retired from public life .
The second well - known incident of a leader extending his term indefinitely was Roman dictator Julius Caesar , who made himself " Perpetual Dictator " ( commonly mistranslated as ' Dictator - for - life ' ) in 45 BC .
His actions would later be mimicked by the French leader Napoleon Bonaparte who was appointed " First Consul for life " in 1802 and five years later , the French senate proclaimed him emperor ( a monarchical title ) .
Several presidents have ruled until their death , but they have not proclaimed themselves as President for Life .
For instance , Nicolae Ceauşescu of Romania , who ruled until his execution ( see Romanian Revolution ) .
PRESIDENTIAL SYMBOLS Section::::Presidential symbols .
As the country 's head of state , in most countries the president is entitled to certain perquisites , and may have a prestigious residence , often a lavish mansion or palace , sometimes more than one ( e.g. summer and winter residences , or a country retreat )
Customary symbols of office may include an official uniform , decorations , a presidential seal , coat of arms , flag and other visible accessories , as well as military honours such as gun salutes , ruffles and flourishes , and a presidential guard .
A common presidential symbol is the presidential sash worn most often by presidents in Latin America and Africa as a symbol of the continuity of the office .

TITLES FOR NON - HEADS OF STATE AS HEAD OF GOVERNMENT Section::::Titles for non - heads of state .
Section::::As head of government .
Some countries with parliamentary systems use a term meaning / translating as " president " ( in some languages indistinguishable from chairman ) for the head of parliamentary government , often as President of the Government , President of the Council of Ministers or President of the Executive Council .
However , such an official is explicitly not the president of the country .
Rather , he / she is called a president in an older sense of the word , to denote the fact that he / she heads the cabinet .
A separate head of state generally exists in their country that instead serves as the president or monarch of the country .
Thus , such officials are really premiers , and to avoid confusion are often described simply as ' prime minister ' when being mentioned internationally .
There are several examples for this kind of presidency :
* The Prime Minister of Spain is officially referred to as the President of the Government of Spain , and informally known as the " president " .
Spain is also a kingdom with a reigning king .
*
The official title of the Italian Prime Minister is President of the Council of Ministers ( Italian Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri )
* Under the French Third and the Fourth Republics , the " President of the Council " ( of ministers – or prime minister ) was the head of government , with the President of the Republic a largely symbolic figurehead .
*
The Prime minister of the Irish Free State from 1922 to 1937 was titled President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State .
At the same time , the Irish Free State was a constitutional monarchy with a reigning monarch , the King of Ireland , as well as a resident Governor - General carrying out many head of state functions .
*
Under the constitutional monarchies of Brazil and Portugal , the President of the Council of Ministers ( Portuguese Presidente do Conselho de Ministros ) was the head of government , with the Monarch being the head of State .
Under the Portuguese First and Second Republics , the head of government was the President of the Ministry ( Portuguese Presidente do Ministério ) and then the President of the Council of Ministers , with the President of the Republic as the head of State .
*
The official title of the Croatian prime minister is President of the Government of the Republic of Croatia ( ) .
*
The official title of the Polish prime minister is President of the Council of Ministers ( Polish Prezes Rady Ministrów ) .
*
In British constitutional practice , the chairman of an Executive Council , acting in such a capacity , is known as a President of the Executive Council .
Usually this person is the Governor and it always stays like that .
* Between 1918 and 1934 , Estonia had no separate head of state .
Both Prime Ministers ( 1918 - 1920 ) and State Elders ( 1920 - 1934 ) often translated as " Presidents " ) were elected by the parliament .
OTHER EXECUTIVE POSITIONS SUB - NATIONAL
Section::::Other executive positions .
Section::::Sub - national .
President can also be the title of the chief executive at a lower administrative level , such as the parish presidents of the parishes of the U.S. state of Louisiana , the presiding member of city council for villages in the U.S. state of Illinois , or the municipal presidents of Mexico 's municipalities .
Perhaps the best known sub - national presidents are the borough presidents of the Five Boroughs of New York City .
POLAND Section::::Poland .
In Poland the President of the City ( ) is the executive authority of the municipality elected in direct elections , the equivalent of the mayor .
The Office of the President ( Mayor ) is also found in Germany and Switzerland .
RUSSIA
Section::::Russia .
Governors of ethnic republics in the Russian Federation used to have the title of President , occasionally alongside other , secondary titles such as Chairman of the Government ( also used by Prime Minister of Russia ) .
This likely reflects the origin of Russian republics as homelands for various ethnic groups : while all federal subjects of Russia are currently de jure equal , their predecessors , the ASSRs , used to enjoy more privileges than the ordinary krais and oblasts of the RSFSR ( such as greater representation in the Soviet of Nationalities ) .
Thus , the ASSRs and their eventual successors would have more in common with nation - states than with ordinary administrative divisions , at least in spirit , and would choose titles accordingly .
Over the course of the 2010s the presidents of Russian republics would progressively change their title to that of Head ( ) , a proposition suggested by the President of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov and later made law by the Parliament of Russia and President Dmitriy Medvedev in 2010 .
Despite this , however , Presidents of Tatarstan would reject this change and , as of 2017 , retain their title in defiance of Russian law .
The new title did not result in any changes in the powers wielded by the governors .
UNITED KINGDOM Section::::United Kingdom .
The Lord President of the Council is one of the Great Officers of State in England who presides over meetings of British Privy Council ; the Cabinet headed by the Prime Minister is technically a committee of the Council , and all decisions of the Cabinet are formally approved through Orders in Council .
Although the Lord President is a member of the Cabinet , the position is largely a ceremonial one and is traditionally given to either the Leader of the House of Commons or the Leader of the House of Lords .
Historically the President of the Board of Trade was a cabinet member .
DEPENDENCIES Section::::Dependencies .
In Alderney , the elected head of government is called the President of the States of Alderney .
In the Isle of Man , there is a President of Tynwald .
SPAIN
Section::::Spain .
In Spain , the executive leaders of the autonomous communities ( regions ) are called presidents .
In each community , they can be called Presidente de la Comunidad or Presidente del Consejo among others .
They are elected by their respective regional assemblies and have similar powers to a state president or governor .
DEPUTIES Section::::Deputies .
Below a president , there can be a number of or " vice presidents " ( or occasionally " deputy presidents " ) and sometimes several " assistant presidents " or " assistant vice presidents " , depending on the organisation and its size .
These posts do not hold the same power but more of a subordinate position to the president .
However , power can be transferred in special circumstances to the deputy or vice president .
Normally vice presidents hold some power and special responsibilities below that of the president .
The difference between vice / deputy presidents and assistant / associate vice presidents is the former are legally allowed to run an organisation , exercising the same powers ( as well as being second in command )
whereas the latter are not .
LEGISLATURES
Section::::Legislatures .
In some countries the speaker of their unicameral legislatures , or of one or both houses of bicameral legislatures , the speakers have the title of president of " the body " , as in the case of Spain , where the Speaker of the Congress is the President of the Congress of Deputies and the Speaker of the Senate is the President of the Senate .
JUDICIARY
FRANCE
Section::::Judiciary .
Section::::France .
In French legal terminology , the president of a court consisting of multiple judges is the foremost judge ; he chairs the meeting of the court and directs the debates ( and this thus addressed as " Mrs President " , " Madame la Présidente " , Mr President " , or Monsieur le Président .
In general , a court comprises several chambers , each with its own president ; thus the most senior of these is called the " first president " ( as in : " the First President of the Court of Cassation is the most senior judge in France " ) .
Similarly in English legal practice the most senior judge in each division uses this title ( e.g. President of the Family Division , President of the Court of Appeal ) .
SPAIN
Section::::Spain .
In the Spanish Judiciary , the leader of a court of multiples judges is called President of the Court .
The same happens with the different bodies of the Spanish judicial system , where we can find a President of the Supreme Court , a President of the National Court and Presidents in the Regional High Courts of Justice and in the Provincial Courts .
The body that rules over the Judiciary in Spain is the General Council of the Judiciary , and its president is the President of the Supreme Court , which is normally called President of the Supreme Court and of the GCJ .
The Constitutional Court is not part of the Judiciary , but the leader of it is called President of the Constitutional Court .
UNITED KINGDOM Section::::United Kingdom .
In the recently established Supreme Court of the United Kingdom , the most senior judge is called the President of the Supreme Court .
The Lady / Lord President of the Court of Session is head of the judiciary in Scotland , and presiding judge ( and Senator ) of the College of Justice and Court of Session , as well as being Lady / Lord Justice General of Scotland and head of the High Court of Justiciary , the offices having been combined in 1784 .
