PREPARATION Section::::Preparation .

It is then immersed in egg batter and dredged in flour to which salt , pepper , and often other seasonings have been added ( called breading ) .
Chicken fried steak is typically deep - fried and served with a cream gravy , while country fried steak is typically fried in a skillet and served with a brown gravy .
The frying medium has traditionally been shortening , but butter and lard have sometimes been used instead .
