STATIC ( DC COMICS )
Static is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics .
The character , a creation of Milestone Comics founders Dwayne McDuffie , Denys Cowan , Michael Davis , and Derek Dingle was initially written by McDuffie and Robert L. Washington III and illustrated by John Paul Leon .
Static 's first appearance was made in Static # 1 ( June 1993 ) in the Modern Age of Comic Books .
Born Virgil Ovid Hawkins , he is a member of a fictional subspecies of humans with superhuman abilities known as metahumans .
Not born with his powers , Hawkins 's abilities develop after an incident exposes him to a radioactive chemical .
This event renders him capable of electromagnetic control and generation .
The character drew much inspiration and was in fact designed to represent a modern - era Spider - Man archetype .
After the closing of Milestone Comics , Static was incorporated into the DC Universe and became a member of the Teen Titans team .
A common misconception is that Hawkins is the son of fellow DC Comics superhero Black Lightning , who debuted much earlier and possesses electrical abilities .
Black Lightning addresses the coincidence once in a Justice League narrative .
Static has made numerous appearances in other forms of media .
The character has been featured in various animated series including its own , Static Shock , a version of the storyline made slightly more suitable for a younger audience .
Static has been featured in animated films and video games as well .
PUBLICATION HISTORY Section::::Publication History .
An African - American teenager , Static was a key character of Milestone Comics , an independently - owned imprint of DC Comics with a greater representation of minority heroes .
Dwayne McDuffie has stated that the creation of Static was a group effort .
Originally developed for Marvel Comics , Static would become a main staple of the Milestone line .
Much of the inspiration for Static came from Marvel 's Spider - Man .
When initially creating the first five characters for Milestone Comics , it was decided that Static would be created as a teenage hero who was a contemporary version of Spider - Man .
Static 's civilian identity , Virgil Hawkins , was named after a black man who was denied entrance to the University of Florida 's law school in 1949 .
Milestone ceased publishing comics in 1997 , but Static was saved from obscurity by The WB animated series Static Shock , which aired for four seasons and led to the 2001 comic book miniseries Static Shock : Rebirth of the Cool .
The 2009 trade paperback of this series was nominated for a Glyph Comics Award for Best Reprint Collection .
McDuffie described the character : " Like any other awkward 15 year - old , Virgil Hawkins worries about pocket money , getting beaten up , and drugs .
But recently , he 's had even more on his mind : stuff like his powers , his secret identity , and drugs .
Because , when innocents are in danger , and Virgil can slip away from class , the geeky youth becomes Static , the dashing , adventurous superhero ! "
The character was introduced in one of the first four titles of comic books published by Milestone in 1993 , founded by Derek T. Dingle , Denys Cowan , Dwayne McDuffie , and Michael Davis .
His early adventures were written by Robert L. Washington III and McDuffie , and penciled by John Paul Leon .
Virgil Hawkins was fifteen years old when he became Static .
In the comics , Virgil 's family consists of his father , Robert , who works at Paris Island Hospital ; his mother , Jean ; and his sister , Sharon .
Virgil attends Ernest Hemingway High School in the city of Dakota with his friends : Frieda Goren , Richard " Rick " Stone , Larry Wade , Chuck , Felix , and Daisy Watkins .
In the guise of Static , Virgil eventually rescues " Rick Stone " from danger .
Not unlike Spider - Man , the character has a propensity for witty banter and humor , especially when engaged with opponents .
In addition , Virgil utilizes his knowledge of science and pop culture in various battles and scenarios as Static .
A self - professed geek , Virgil is portrayed as avid comic book and video game fan , something that was retained for his DCAU incarnation .
In the comics , Virgil regularly visits the local comic store , in addition to creating fan comics with his friends , and participates in HeroClix - style and other tabletop RPG games .
In addition , he has been shown to be an avid video gamer at several points in both his series and the Teen Titans .
In the 2001 miniseries , Static Shock : Rebirth of the Cool , it is shown that at that point in time , Virgil is into collecting Pokémon cards and he likes Pikachu ( the flagship Pokémon of the franchise and a fellow user of electricity ) .
In an interview with former Teen Titans writer Geoff Johns , he expressed interest in having Static as part of the team , stating , " I really wanted Static on the team , but there 's so much red tape there that every time I requested it
DC said ' not yet '
and so I never got to have him " and later stating he had plans for the character since Teen Titans # 1
( vol . 3 ) .
Any obstructions were eventually resolved and Static appeared in the Terror Titans , with his Milestone continuity folded in the mainstream New Earth continuity .
At the San Diego Comic - Con 2008 , it was announced that Static would be joining the mainstream DC Universe where he would be added to the Teen Titans .
Static made his first canonical DC Universe appearance in Terror Titans # 4 , battling Rose Wilson in the final round of the Dark Side Club Tournament .
In June 2010 , DC Comics announced that Static would be receiving his own series in 2011 .
The series was to be written by Felicia Henderson and drawn by Scott McDaniel , but was cancelled before the first issue could be released following the death of Static 's creator , Dwayne McDuffie .
However , a one - shot entitled Static Shock Special was released in June 2011 , written by Henderson and drawn by Denys Cowan .
Batwoman artist JH Williams III provided the one - shot 's cover .
A new series featuring Static titled Static Shock was launched in September 2011 as part of DC 's relaunch after the Flashpoint event .
The book is written by John Rozum and drawn by Scott McDaniel , who also co - writes .
As part of an effort to better integrate Static into the mainstream DCU , the title takes place in New York City rather than Dakota .
FICTIONAL CHARACTER
BIOGRAPHY
DAKOTA VERSE Section::::Fictional character biography .
Section::::Dakota Verse .
Doused with an experimental chemical in a gang war he was caught up in , high school student Virgil Ovid Hawkins gains a variety of electromagnetic powers and becomes a costumed crusader against crime .
Like most teenaged heroes in the Spider - Man mold , he is often overwhelmed by the combined responsibilities of his career as a superhero and typical adolescent problems .
A resident of the city of Dakota , Virgil first gained his electromagnetic powers at a huge showdown between the gangs of the city , when he hoped to get revenge on a gang member who had been bullying him .
The authorities arrive and release tear gas with what they believe to be a harmless radioactive marker so that any gang members would not escape arrest .
The cops do not know the marker had been further spiked with an experimental mutagen called Quantum Juice ( Q - Juice ) .
This event ultimately came to be known as the so - called " Big Bang .
" Those who were exposed came to be referred to as " Bang Babies " because the Big Bang was their metahuman birth .
When the agency behind the experiment tried to capture him , he fights back , discovering that he has gained the ability to generate , manipulate , and control electromagnetism .
Virgil names himself " Static " and , armed with his wits and powers , became a superhero .
For the most part , Virgil keeps his secret from his family , but his friend , Frieda Goren , learns his identity when he attempts to protect her from becoming a prize in a small skirmish between gangs .
Virgil has friends like Rick Stone & Larry Wade , he also has a romantic interest in his other friend Frieda Goren
but she was already involved with Larry Wade .
He also has feelings for a girl named Daisy Watkins , but his ' responsibilities ' as Static interfere with their dates too many times and Daisy calls their relationship off .
In Static Shock : Rebirth of the Cool , Virgil is involved with a girl named Madison , but Frieda ends up fighting with her over him .
Static has had confrontations with numerous Bang - Babies and other super powered adversaries :
Hotstreak , Tarmack , Holocaust , Commando X , Puff , Coil , Snakefingers , Rift , The Swarm , Dr. Kilgore , Rubberband Man , Brat - atat - tat , Prometheus , Run , Jump & Burn , Boom Box , Powerfist , LaserJet , etc .
Other Bang - Babies that Static has encountered include Virus , D - Struct and Hyacinth .
STATIC SHOCK : REBIRTH OF THE COOL Section::::Static Shock : Rebirth of the Cool .
In the mini - series Static Shock : Rebirth of the Cool it is revealed that Virgil has given up his superhero career as Static .
He enjoys his time being a civilian again but sometimes misses being a superhero as his friend and confidant Frieda gets him to begrudgingly admit .
He eventually returns after being persuaded by many fellow heroes including Blitzen and Hardware for one final battle .
After the battle , with a man named John Tower who is revealed to have been the first and greatest superhero in the Milestone Universe , Virgil decides to return to his career as Static .
But as he informs Frieda it likely wo n't be on a full - time basis as it was before .
OTHER HEROES
Section::::Other heroes .
Later in the comic line , Static is aided by allies : the Shadow Cabinet , the Blood Syndicate , and DCPD officer Captain Summers , who has a big interest in police cases involving Bang - Babies .
Static teams up with Page , the sidekick to Kobalt , in order to stop a maddened Bang - Baby who had become half - fly .
Static takes a moment to scold Page , who , in his opinion , seems more concerned with making excuses over their initial meet up than what was more important , stopping the danger .
Static ends up joining the unofficial group called Heroes .
Multiple superheroes come together to protect the town of Iberia from a dam break .
Many innocent citizens perish , but the heroes are still recognized for their efforts in saving the survivors and doing what they could .
Static appears among the group , quips " You started the X - Men without me " , and talks his way onto the team .
Minutes later , the Shadow Cabinet , now corrupt , sends a death squad after a few of his newfound friends .
DC UNIVERSE Section::::DC Universe .
Following the death of Darkseid ( as chronicled in Final Crisis ) , the space - time continuum was torn asunder , threatening the existence of both the Dakotaverse and the mainstream DC universe .
The being known as Dharma was able to use energies that he harnessed from Rift ( upon that being 's defeat in Worlds Collide ) to merge the two universes , creating an entirely new continuity .
Only Dharma , Icon , and Superman are aware that Dakota and its inhabitants ever existed in a parallel universe .
DARK SIDE CLUB Section::::Dark Side Club .
In the buildup to the Final Crisis , the cosmic tyrant Darkseid hires the Terror Titans to capture Static , along with a number of the other Bang Babies in Dakota for use in the metahuman deathmatches in the Dark Side Club .
During his tenure in captivity , Virgil is subjected to the Anti - Life Equation and entered into the tournaments , where he presumably kills a number of combatants .
He quickly becomes the champion , and reigns undefeated for a time , though in the end , he proves hard to control .
To Clock King 's displeasure , he has to be restricted to the lower - levels where he is kept locked up and heavily sedated .
In an attempt to entice Rose Wilson and make a profit , Clock King releases Static and sets him against Rose in the ring .
In the ring , the two have an intense fight where Static 's lightning - fast attacks are able to injure Rose , even despite her precognition .
After a drawn - out fight , Static emerges the winner , but briefly breaks free of control before being sedated once more .
Static is eventually freed by Rose ( albeit off panel ) and takes his revenge against his former captors , electrocuting Lashina and her cohorts as they try to escape .
He also briefly duels with fellow electricity - wielder Dreadbolt , defeating and binding him in metal along with the other Terror Titans .
In his final appearance he 's seen joining up with Miss Martian and Aquagirl , planning their next move .
JOINING THE TEEN
TITANS
Section::::Joining the Teen Titans .
After the Crisis has ended , Static and the other Dark Side Club survivors arrive at Titans Tower in order to rest .
Wonder Girl , the current leader of the team , offers all of the young heroes spots on the team roster , but most of them , including Terra and Zachary Zatara , decline .
While exploring the Tower , Virgil strikes up a chemistry with Aquagirl , a teenaged superheroine who was briefly a member of the team during 52 .
During a conversation with Virgil , she claims that she enjoyed her time with the team , and wishes to join up again , a statement that influences his decision to do the same .
He also playfully insults Kid Devil and Jaime Reyes after they attempt to talk to him , mocking Kid Devil over his recent loss of his abilities .
He claims that he was abducted by the Terror Titans months beforehand , and realizes that his family must believe him to be dead .
Believing he has no place to go for the time being , Static decides to become a Titan and live at the Tower until he can get his life together .
Later , when crazed former - Titan Jericho ( in the guise of Cyborg ) takes control of the Tower and its systems in an attempt to kill the team , Static thwarts him by releasing a high - energy charge overloading the entire Tower , as well as Cyborg 's body , saving the rest of the team in the process .
During a trip to the piers in order to relax , the Titans face off with the supervillain team known as the Fearsome Five , after they kidnap Wonder Girl and hold her hostage on Alcatraz Island .
In the ensuing battle , Static defeats the villain known as Rumble by tricking him into moving into a pool of water , thus amplifying the effects of his electric attacks .
In the aftermath of the battle , Virgil attends Kid Devil 's funeral after he is killed saving the city from a nuclear explosion .
When former Titan Raven shows up at Titans Tower injured and unconscious , Static assists Justice Society of America member
Dr. Mid - Nite in helping treat her , using his abilities to sedate Raven when a demon emerges from her body .
BRAVE AND THE BOLD Section::::Brave and the Bold .
It was recently revealed that prior to his abduction , Static teamed with Justice League member Black Lightning in order to stop former Blood Syndicate member Holocaust , who had tried to kill the superhero while he was acting as the keynote speaker at Ernest Hemingway High 's senior graduation .
RETURN TO DAKOTA
Section::::Return to Dakota .
Virgil finally decides to see his family again after learning that a deadly virus has been infecting citizens of Dakota , including Sharon .
After returning home , Virgil reunites with his family as well as Frieda , and learns that his girlfriend Madison has left him during his absence .
He discovers that whoever created the virus is also selling limited supplies of the vaccine , and attacks the lab where it is being made .
Upon breaking into the facility , Static is surprised and knocked out by Holocaust .
After refusing to help Holocaust in his pursuits , Static is imprisoned in a specialized containment unit alongside Aquagirl , Wonder Girl , and Bombshell .
Holocaust informs the heroes that he plans to kill them and weaponize their abilities in order to sell them , but is ambushed by the rest of the Titans before this can happen .
Holocaust easily defeats them , only to be confronted by Cyborg , who has recruited former Titans Kid Flash and Superboy .
The three are able to hold off Holocaust long enough for Virgil and the others to escape , and ultimately the combined might of all ten Teen Titans is enough to defeat the villain once and for all .
After this , Virgil reconciles with Frieda and tells her that he has tricked his family into believing that he has taken part in a lengthy quantum physics fellowship , thus giving him an excuse to live in San Francisco with the rest of the Titans .
He also makes one last attempt to win back Madison , but she silently rejects him .
After this , Virgil and the other Titans decide to head home , now with Superboy and Kid Flash as members again .
After a mission to another dimension to rescue Raven , Virgil returns home to find that he no longer has his powers .
Furious and scared over his situation , as well as his inability to help Miss Martian awaken from her coma , Virgil attempts to leave the Tower and return to Dakota .
He is stopped by Cyborg , who tells Virgil that he will be of no help to anyone back home without his abilities , and tells him that he has arranged for Virgil to be taken to Cadmus Labs to find a way to get his powers back .
Superboy offers to travel to Cadmus in order to support his friend , but Virgil tells him that the Titans need him now .
Following a farewell breakfast , Static leaves for Cadmus , with Wonder Girl assuring him that he will always have a place on the team .
During the events of Flashpoint , Barry Allen accidentally alters history after a battle with Professor Zoom .
In the newly created reality , Static is shown back in - costume with his powers restored .
THE NEW 52 Section::::The New 52 .
Following the reality - warping events of the 2011 Flashpoint storyline , Virgil and his family leave Dakota for New York after an unspecified tragic incident that , among other things , left his sister Sharon as two separate , identical entities .
The vigilante Hardware gives Virgil a new costume and modified flying disk , which enables the two to remain in contact despite living in different cities .
Hardware also gives him an internship at S.T.A.R. Labs as an after school job .
During his first major battle , Static defeats the villain Sunspot and earns the attention of a criminal syndicate known as the Slate Gang .
Static Shock was cancelled as of issue 8 as part of DC 's " Second Wave " of The New 52 titles and replaced by an alternative title .
In Teen Titans , it is revealed that Virgil designed the cape and wing apparatus of Red Robin 's costume while at S.T.A.R. Later , while recuperating at S.T.A.R. Labs from a previous battle , the Titans seek Virgil 's help in curing Kid Flash , whose cells Virgil discovers are rapidly deteriorating as a result of an alteration of his powers .
Virgil provides Kid Flash with a new costume ( based on a personal sketch for a variant of the Flash 's costume ) containing materials that realign his molecules while stabilizing his powers , saving Kid Flash in the process .
POWERS AND ABILITIES Section::::Powers and abilities .
Static 's powers allow him to control electromagnetic phenomena , in particular allowing him to manifest , manipulate both electrical and magnetic energy — Static 's powers are best described as superconductor electromagnetism .
Static 's powers center around electromagnetism , making him part of the Earth 's electromagnetic field as well as capable of generating and storing his own electromagnetic energy .
He can choose to keep the electromagnetic energy that he currently holds in his body by controlling the current and voltage for whenever he wants to use it .
Static 's body can generate raw electromagnetic energy , which he can control at will for various purposes .
Such uses commonly include magnetizing objects , electrocuting opponents , levitating objects ( such as manhole - covers or his self - built metal saucer for use in flight ) and people , restraining or adhering people / objects to various surfaces in the form of " static cling " , generating " taser punches and kicks " with effects similar to a stun gun and at times enough power to send opponents flying during close combat , various electromagnetic displays as well as electromagnetic nets or cages , blinding flashes , generating thrown ball lightning , producing electromagnetic pulses , and generating electromagnetic force fields to shield himself from attacks , even stopping bullets in mid - air .
In the comic book series , Static has displayed the ability to manipulate subatomic particles , in particular electrons .
In at least one instance , he has used this ability as an offensive attack to easily knockout a villain with the villain 's own electrons .
As well as releasing surges of electromagnetic energy , Static can also drain sources of electricity , such as power lines , batteries and fuse boxes to recharge
/ replenish his own energy supply .
He has also displayed the ability to regenerate his powers after being completely drained by energy - draining villains .
Whenever Static has used his powers to a high degree , or experience any other such large energy - drain , he will also experience a sudden , acute sense of fatigue , as his electromagnetic powers are tied into his own bioelectric energy levels .
In the episode " Aftershock " , in the 1st season of the animated series , an analysis of his blood shows that Static 's electrolytes / blood - salt levels are higher - than - normal , highlighting that Static needs higher blood - salt levels to support the use of his powers , but the higher sodium levels seem to have no effect on his health .
Static can also sense and feel - out sources of electromagnetic energy , able to tell if a seemingly abandoned area is actually hot or not .
Static can use his powers to hear radio waves and tap into phone lines , including listening in on the police broadband and music stations , as well as making calls , and is also able to use his powers to mimic the uses of electronic devices such as a CD player ( in " Aftershock " , he also called himself a " human CD player , ( even got Surround sound " ) , and is even able to use his powers to use an ordinary trashcan cover simultaneously as a shotgun microphone and a loudspeaker .
It 's notable that Static has more of a distinctive advantage in cities than anywhere - else , as shown in the events of " Aftershock " , as even in a park , surrounded by trees , Static could make use of the metal pipelines under the ground with his magnetic powers .
In both the animated series and comic book , he is shown using his powers to mimic that of a blowtorch allowing him to cut and wield metal together .
In the animated series , Static 's powers grant him resistance or immunity to forms of mind control , since the human brain is an electromagnetic organ .
In " Attack of the Living Brain Puppets " , Static is immune to Madelyn Spaulding 's ability to hear the thoughts of others and exert control over their actions , ( as speculated by Richie , ) Static 's greater bioelectric field shields him and his brainwaves from any attempts at reading his mind and asserting control over him , as also seen in the second part of " A League of Their Own " , when one of Brainiac 's mind - controlling devices shorts out shortly after being placed on Static .
This trait has also been adapted into the comic book mythos ; in Terror Titans , Static is shown to have resistance to Darkseid 's Anti - Life Equation , coming back to his senses .
Following the events of " Flashpoint " , Static is given a new flying disk that now contains a holographic interface and is capable of collapsing into separate pieces or re - configuring into various forms for various uses and applications .
In addition to allowing Static to remain in contact with Hardware , the disk also displays charts and other information relevant to the mission at hand .
Virgil has also begun using a three - piece detachable bō staff both activated by and used in conjunction with his powers for use in close - ranged fighting .
Static 's body has been shown to automatically heal itself , even from what would otherwise be lethal wounds , when drawing in large amounts of energy from a nearby energy source .
Tim Drake has stated that Virgil 's understanding of molecular structure rivals the Flash 's .
Virgil Hawkins is a highly gifted student with a particular interest in the sciences .
He is a talented inventor and a natural strategist .
Virgil also possesses an almost fanboyish knowledge of comic books , role playing games , pop culture , and science fiction .
WEAKNESSES Section::::Weaknesses .
Static 's primary weaknesses are insulators , as his powers have little or no effect on them ; as shown in his battle with Rubberband Man .
Wood seems to be the one he has the most difficulty with , as it can not be electromagnetically manipulated , levitated , or damaged .
In the animated series , he has a vulnerability to water which ( as water is a conductor of electricity ) , if he gets taken and drenched by surprise , shorts out his powers until he can dry off and replenish them .
He can , however , fly in the rain without short - circuiting .
This weakness only applies in the animated series as Static has never shown a weakness to water in the comics and has even used it to his advantage .
