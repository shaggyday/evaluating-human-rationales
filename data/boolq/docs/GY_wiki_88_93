1965–66
MANCHESTER CITY F.C. SEASON
The 1965–66 season was Manchester City F.C. 's seventy - fourth season of league football , and second consecutive season back in the Football League Second Division .
This season is widely believed to have been the start of Manchester City 's golden era , a period largely concurrent with the reign of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison as managers at the club , and then of the aftermath of the break - up of the partnership .
This season began City 's highest concentration of silverware to seasons played - winning the Second Division for a record sixth time in this season , the club would claim the Football League First Division title , the FA Cup , the Football League Cup twice , the Charity Shield twice , and in European competition the UEFA Cup Winners ' Cup all within the space of the ten seasons following .
This season also saw the club sign several players who would become iconic figures in Manchester City 's history - Mike Summerbee , George Heslop , and Colin Bell were all signed near the start of the season .
Not coincidentally , the season and the seasons following also saw the presence of some of the club 's longest - serving players .
Four of the club 's ten players with the most appearances for the club played during this season - Bell , Summerbee , Alan Oakes , and Mike Doyle - and a further three of those ten - Joe Corrigan , Tommy Booth and Willie Donachie - would join within the following three seasons .
