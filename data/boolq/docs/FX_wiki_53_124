LIST OF PEERAGES INHERITED BY WOMEN
In the peerages of the British Isles , most titles have traditionally been created for men and with remainder to male heirs .
However , some titles are created with special remainders to allow women to inherit them .
Some of the oldest English baronies were created by writ and pass to female heirs when a peer dies with daughters and no sons , while some titles are created with a man 's family in mind , if he is without sons and unlikely to produce any .
