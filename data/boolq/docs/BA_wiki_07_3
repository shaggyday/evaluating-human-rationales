CHINA SOUTHERN AIRLINES
China Southern Airlines Company Limited is an airline headquartered in Baiyun District , Guangzhou , Guangdong Province , China .
Established on 1 July 1988 following the restructuring of the Civil Aviation Administration of China that acquired and merged a number of domestic airlines , the airline became one of China 's " Big Three " airlines ( alongside Air China and China Eastern Airlines ) , the world 's sixth - largest airline measured by passengers carried and Asia 's largest airline in fleet size , revenue and passengers carried .
With its main hubs at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport and Beijing Capital International Airport , the airline operates more than 2,000 flights to more than 200 destinations daily and as a member of SkyTeam until January 1 2019 .
The logo of the airline consists of a kapok flower ( which is also the city flower of Guangzhou ) on a blue tail fin .
The parent company of China Southern Airlines Company Limited is China Southern Air Holding Company , a state - owned enterprise that was supervised by the State - owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council .
HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT FOUNDING Section::::History and development .
Section::::Founding .
In 1984 , the Chinese government disclosed the decision to decentralise the Civil Aviation Administration of China ( CAAC ) .
Formed in 1949 , CAAC was an all - encompassing organisation responsible for civil aviation in China as it was tasked with passenger transport , resource development and survey work , air traffic control , aircraft maintenance and personnel training .
The decentralisation decision would result in numerous regional airlines , with four main carriers to be responsible for the majority of international and domestic air traffic : Air China , China Southern Airlines , China Eastern Airlines and China Southwest Airlines ; CAAC itself would be rationalised into a regulatory and administrative organisation .
In 1988 , CAAC granted its seven regional divisions , among which was the Guangzhou Regional Administration , limited operating autonomy with the status of " associate " airlines .
China Southern Airlines began flying under its own name and livery in February 1991 .
At this time , the aircraft operated some 160 flights a day on 100 routes using the Antonov An-24 , Boeing 737 and Boeing 757 , along with helicopters and agricultural aircraft .
In December 1992 , the airline placed an US$ 800-million order for six Boeing 777s and the associated spare parts and training .
The airline completed its decentralisation from CAAC when it gained independence on 10 October 1993 .
As such , the airline could from then on restructure itself into shareholding enterprises , independently arrange external financing and establish subsidiaries to complement its core enterprise .
During the airline 's early years , the carrier was the dominant domestic carrier .
Together with the two major airlines of China – Air China and China Eastern – the airline handled half of passenger traffic carried by all Chinese carriers .
Owing to Air China 's status as the country 's flag carrier , the airline is entitled to extensive international service rights , with China Eastern and China Southern 's international networks confined to mainly East Asia and within Asia , respectively .
Like other Chinese carriers , China Southern was subjected to CAAC 's exclusive right to grant operating rights for every prospective route as well as to regulate domestic prices .
EXPANSION Section::::Expansion .
To raise its operating standards and distance itself from mostly unprofitable second and third tiers domestic airlines , the carrier signed agreements with a number of foreign carriers regarding staff training and aircraft maintenance , with the ultimate aim of being listed on the , possibly as soon as early 1995 .
Starting in the mid-1990s , China Southern sought to expand its international reach beyond Asia .
In December 1995 , the Chinese and US governments signed an aviation agreement that would allow the commencement of non - stop air services between the two countries .
After having been granted the right to establish services to Amsterdam in early 1996 , the airline started Guangzhou – Beijing – Amsterdam , its first long - haul route , in November 1996 .
The following year , the carrier commenced non - stop trans - Pacific services to Los Angeles , as well as services to Brisbane .
The start of European and American services coincided with the arrival of the long - range Boeing 777s , the first of which was delivered in late December 1995 , as well as a general expansion and upgrade of the carrier 's fleet and the associated facilities .
Due to engine - certification and labour - relations issues , the delivery of the first Boeing 777 was more than a month behind schedule .
As a result , the carrier considered , but ultimately decided against , leasing the Boeing 747 - 400 , which would have been used to cover anticipated delays as well as to launch trans - Pacific services to the US .
Nevertheless , the airline planned to double its fleet of 67 aircraft .
In April 1996 , the Chinese government would place an order , on China Southern 's behalf , for 10 Airbus A320s ; the delivery of the first aircraft , and China Southern 's first Airbus , was made the following year .
Guangzhou Aircraft Maintenance Engineering Company , which was jointly established with Lockheed Aircraft Services International and Hutchinson Whampoa , was carrying out expansion of its aircraft maintenance facilities in anticipation of the increase .
In order to keep pace with fast developments , China Southern raised capital from the capital market .
The airline was successfully listed on the Hong Kong and New York Stock Exchanges in July 1997 , raising $ 600–$700 million .
Much of the funds raised were used to facilitate the airline 's fleet expansion , repay debt and investments in other capital ; it followed up with domestic listing in 2003 at the Shanghai Stock Exchange .
By 1997 , the airline , along with its joint - venture airlines Xiamen Airlines , Shantou Airlines and Guangxi Airlines , was carrying some 15 million passengers per year using about 90 aircraft , operating about 270 routes among 68 destinations and almost 2,450 flights per week .
The airline group 's revenue totalled some US$ 1.4 billion with a net income of $ 90 million .
MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS Section::::Mergers and acquisitions .
The end of the 1990s was a period of consolidation for the Chinese airline industry .
Initially , China Southern looked to acquire several smaller non - profitable domestic carriers as it sought to highlight its expansion plans in an effort to raise funds ; among the deals was the purchase of 60 % shares of Guizhou Airlines .
Due to the weakening economy amidst the 1997 Asian financial crisis and intense competition among the some 30 Chinese carriers , in 1998 , CAAC considered a comprehensive restructuring of the industry that would see the consolidation of the airlines into three or five carrier groups .
At one stage , it was reported that CAAC was contemplating a forced merger of Air China and China Southern .
Given the latter 's dual listing in Hong Kong and New York , it was thought that such a merger would have eased Air China 's path towards its own share offering .
China Southern confirmed that such talks between them were occurring , although they ultimately proved fruitless .
Had the merger proceeded , their combined fleets would have numbered some 250 aircraft , which would have made the resultant airline the largest in Asia .
Although there was considerable resistance to CAAC 's call to rationalise the industry , in July 2000 , the administrative body announced that the ten airlines under its direct management will be merged into three airline groups , revolving around Air China , China Eastern Airlines and China Southern itself .
Within a month , China Southern had started absorbing Zhengzhou - based Zhongyuan Airlines , which at the time operated five Boeing 737s and two Xian
Y-7 turboprops .
The carrier would later merge with Shenyang - based China Northern Airlines and Urumqi - based Xinjiang Airlines to form China Southern Air Holding Co. , a process that took more than two years and would culminate in China Southern 's acquisition of their US$ 2 billion 's worth of assets ( as well as $ 1.8 billion of debt ) in November 2004 .
Consequently , China Southern 's fleet expanded from some 140 aircraft to over 210 .
The takeovers meant that the carrier became the main airline at Shenyang and Urumqi , with passenger numbers ' jumping from 28.2 million in 2004 to 44.1 million in 2005 .
As a result , China Southern Airlines became one of the " Big Three " carriers in the country .
Since then , it has successively taken over shareholding stocks and joined the equity in numerous Chinese carriers .
The airline is the major shareholder of Xiamen Airlines ( 55 % ) and Chongqing Airlines ( 60 % ) ; it also invests in Sichuan Airlines ( 39 % ) .
Amidst the major consolidation of the airline industry , China Southern in April 2000 started dedicated cargo services from Shenzhen using a Boeing 747 - 200F ( which was quickly upgraded to the Boeing 747 - 400F ) wet - leased from Atlas Air .
To capitalise on the economic growth of the Pearl River Delta region ( which includes Hong Kong ) , the carrier constructed a dedicated cargo centre in Shenzhen .
Successful operations prompted an order for two Boeing 747 - 400Fs the following year .
The airline by now had commenced operations to Sydney and Melbourne .
In September 2003 , China Southern signed a purchase agreement for four Airbus A330 - 200s , to be delivered from 2005 .
This was part of the order placed in April by the China Aviation Supplies Imp . & Exp .
Group covering 30 aircraft .
China Southern became the first mainland Chinese A330 operator with the delivery of the first example February 2005 .
China Southern followed up in September 2005 with a further order for eight A330 - 300s and two A330 - 200s .
The month of January 2005 proved to be significant for civil aviation in China in general and China Southern in particular .
In preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing , China Southern and the Chinese government placed several landmark widebody - aircraft orders from Airbus and Boeing .
More specifically , on 28 January 2005 , the carrier became the first ( and so far the only ) Chinese carrier to commit to the Airbus A380 double - deck aircraft , when it signed a general - terms agreement for five examples worth US$ 1.4 billion at catalogue prices .
On the same day , China Southern , along with five other domestic carriers , placed a bulk order for 60 Boeing 7E7s ( later renamed the Boeing 787 Dreamliner ) .
The aircraft were worth $ 7.2 billion at list prices , and the first example was expected to be delivered in time for the Olympics ; however , the first aircraft did not arrive until June 2013 .
Earlier during the month , the CAAC had approved the temporary operations of charter flights between mainland China and Taiwan .
On the same day as the widebody orders , a China Southern Airlines Boeing 777 - 200 took off from Guangzhou and landed in Taipei the following day , becoming the first mainland Chinese aircraft to land in the Republic of China since 1949 , when the Kuomintang were involved in Chinese Civil War with the Communist Party of China .
The flight carried 242 passengers home after the Lunar New Year .
Previously , passengers travelling between the mainland and Taiwan had to transit through a third port such as Hong Kong or Macau .
Within three years , in July 2008 , a China Southern Airlines Airbus A330 carrying 230 tourists again landed in Taipei .
The governments of China and Taiwan had both agreed to allow direct flights across the Taiwan Strait in June , ending six decades of limited air travel between the two sides .
Following the flight , China Southern Airlines Chairman and pilot of the flight , Liu Shaoyong , said , " From today onward , regular commercial flights will replace the rumbling warplanes over the skies of the Taiwan Strait , and relations between the two sides will become better and better . "
Following two years of negotiations which had started in August 2004 , China Southern in late June 2006 signed an agreement with SkyTeam , one of the three global airline alliances , formally pledging itself to the improvement of standards with the aim of its eventual joining .
According to the agreement , the airline committed to the upgrade of handling services , facilities and training of at least 75 % of its staff to SkyTeam 's standards .
On 15 November 2007 , China officially joined SkyTeam , becoming the eleventh carrier to join the grouping and the first mainland Chinese carrier to join an airline alliance .
The welcoming ceremony was attended by high - ranking Chinese government and SkyTeam corporate officials and was held at the Great Hall of the People .
The carrier 's integration with the alliance continued with its entry into SkyTeam Cargo in November 2010 , and its joint - venture carrier Xiamen Airlines ' formal joining in November 2012 .
With China Eastern 's ascension in June 2011 , SkyTeam furthered its leading presence on the mainland Chinese market ; the remaining Big Three carrier , Air China , is a member of Star Alliance .
It followed up with another Airbus order on 7 July 2006 , when it confirmed a deal covering the purchase of 50 more A320 narrow bodies for delivery from 2009 .
The order included 13 A319 - 100s , 20 A320 - 200s and 17 A321 - 200s , reportedly worth $ 3.3 billion at list price .
In December 2005 , China Southern Airlines along with CASGC , announced an order with Boeing for 9 Boeing 737 - 700s and 11 Boeing 737 - 800s .
In June 2006 , China Southern Airlines confirmed another order of 3 Boeing 737 - 700s and 7 Boeing 737 - 800s .
The deliveries would continue through 2010 .
On 18 October 2006 , China Southern Airlines placed an order for 6 Boeing 777 freighters , striding forward a brand new step in its cargo development .
The aircraft would be delivered from November 2008 to July 2010 .
On 20 August 2007 , China Southern Airlines announced its intention for an order of 25 Boeing 737 - 700s and 30 Boeing 737 - 800s , which will be delivered from May 2011 to October 2013 .
It was a mere two months before , on 23 October 2007 , China Southern Airlines announced that it had placed an order for 10 additional Airbus A330 - 200s .
The order has a listed price of US$ 1.677 billion and the aircraft will be delivered from March 2010 to August 2012 .
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Section::::Recent developments .
During 2009 , China Southern Airlines remodeled its strategy from a point to point hub to a full hub and spoke carrier , which has been proven successful .
Along with that , the airline has rapidly expanded its international market share , particularly in Australia , where passenger numbers in 2011 have been 97 % greater than in 2010 .
On 21 January 2010 , China Southern Airlines announced an order for an additional 20 A320 - 200s , scheduled for delivery from 2011 , due to the falling fuel costs and surging passenger demand .
In March 2010 , the Chinese carrier issued new shares in Hong Kong and Shanghai 2010 to raise 10.75 billion yuan ( $ 1.57 billion ) in a bid to pay off outstanding loans .
In December , CNY810 million ( $ 121.5 million ) was injected by China Southern Airlines into its subsidiary Xiamen Airlines to fund its fleet expansion .
In November 2010 , China Southern Airlines signed an agreement with Airbus for the purchase of six A330s and 30 A320s–200 .
On 11 January 2011 , China Southern Airlines announced a lease for 10 Embraer E-190 , set to be delivered from the second half of 2011 .
On 27 January 2011 , China Southern Airlines was awarded a four - star ranking by Skytrax .
It is the largest airline to hold this title .
On 17 October 2011 , China Southern Airlines made its first flight with the Airbus A380 .
Initially , the airline deployed the A380s on domestic routes , flying between Guangzhou , Beijing , Shanghai and Hong Kong .
At the same time , the carrier conducted negotiations to commence A380 international services .
Due to the government - imposed limitation which confined an international route to a single airline , China Southern in August 2012 announced its intention to initiate Beijing - Paris services in cooperation with Air China , pending government approval .
Two months later , the A380 was deployed on Guangzhou - Los Angeles services .
Early A380 operations were unprofitable and the aircraft , underutilised ; services to Sydney were thus launched in October 2013 .
By now talks with Air China on Beijing - Paris services had ceased .
While China Southern , like the other Big Three Chinese carriers , had been expanding rapidly since 2000 , much of their activities had been focused on the domestic market .
With the increase in outflow of Chinese tourists , who in 2012 for example spent $ 102 billion internationally , as well as the rapid construction and introduction of high - speed rail in China , the carrier shifted its outlook overseas in order to sustain growth .
Owing to the location of its hub at Guangzhou , which hinders the airline effectively serving the North American market , the airline concentrated its international expansion on Australasia .
In June 2012 , with the inauguration of services from Guangzhou to London - Heathrow , the airline started marketing its services connecting Europe and Australia as the " Canton Route " , an alternative to the Kangaroo Route flown by carriers such as Qantas .
It hoped to attract the predominantly business traffic that travel between Europe and Australia , and channel such sixth - freedom traffic as well as traffic from mainland China through its Guangzhou hub ( thereby transforming the carrier 's network from one that emphasises point - to - point to a hub - and - spoke system ) .
The carrier by now had added cities such as Auckland , Istanbul , Perth and Vancouver to its route map .
During May – June 2012 , China Southern Airlines has recruited Dutch flight attendants to serve the First and Business class sections for flights from Guangzhou to Amsterdam .
On 7 June 2013 , China Southern Airlines began operating its first Boeing 787 .
Shortly after the disappearance and crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 , China Southern revealed that seven of the passengers had bought tickets on the flight via its codeshare agreement with Malaysia Airlines .
Two of those passengers have been confirmed to have been traveling with stolen passports .
In early 2015 it was announced that the airline would lease 24 Airbus A320neo aircraft from AerCap for delivery between 2016 and 2019 .
On 15 November 2018 , the airline announced that it would leave SkyTeam by 1 January 2019 and will strengthen its partnership with American Airlines and others .
CORPORATE AFFAIRS Section::::Corporate affairs .
China Southern is headquartered in Baiyun District , Guangzhou , Guangdong Province , China .
China Southern plans to open a new headquarters facility on a site on the outskirts of Guangzhou , about from Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport .
Woods Bagot won a competition for the architect firm which would design the facility .
The proposed site consists of two parcels of land on opposite sides of a highway leading to Baiyun Airport ; both sites are shaped like wings .
The site will have a bridge and light rail system that operates above the highway to connect the two parcels , which will each have distinct functions .
For instance , the east parcel will house internal functions such as the data center facilities , staff dormitories , and the training center .
The airline wants it to be aesthetically pleasing from the air since it sits below a runway approach .
The site will have a lot of outdoor space , which Woods Bagot designed along with Hargreaves Associates and Sherwood Design Engineers .
Jean Weng , a Woods Bagot Beijing - based principal , said " Most Chinese cities are very dense and very urban , but China Southern wants to create a human - scale campus , that 's close to nature . "
DESTINATIONS Section::::Destinations .
China Southern Airlines serves 193 destinations in 35 different countries worldwide .
It maintains a strong presence in the domestic market with its main hubs at Beijing Capital International Airport and Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport with secondary hubs at Shanghai Pudong International Airport , Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport , and Ürümqi Diwopu International Airport , along with other focus cities in Changchun , Changsha , Dalian , Shenyang , Shenzhen , Wuhan and Zhengzhou .
The airline plans to continue to develop Chongqing and Ürümqi as hubs as well to exploit the domestic market potential .
China Southern offers 485 flights a day from its Guangzhou hub and 221 from its Beijing hub .
The airline provides services to 65 international destinations .
Most of the international flights link Guangzhou with world cities .
There are also plenty of international flights operated through Beijing , Shanghai , Ürümqi ( notably to Central Asia ) and Dalian ( to Japan , South Korea , and Russia ) .
China Southern Airlines has developed an extensive network to Southeast Asia and also has become the Chinese airline with the largest presence in Australia .
China Southern is also considering expanding into the South American markets , as well as further expansion into the African market .
ALLIANCE
Section::::Alliance .
On 28 August 2004 , China Southern Airlines signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the airline alliance SkyTeam .
On 15 November 2007 , the airline was officially welcomed as the 11th member of SkyTeam , becoming the first mainland Chinese airline to join any global airline alliance , expanding the alliance 's presence on mainland China .
In late November 2017 , it was rumored on several travel media sites that China Southern Airlines was considering joining oneworld , after growing disillusionment following Delta Air Lines investment in China Eastern Airlines .
On 15 November , China Southern Airlines released an official statement saying that it will discontinue its Skyteam membership on 01 January 2019 , whether or not the airline is going to join Oneworld remains unclear .
Rumors say that the airline is unlikely to join Oneworld anytime soon as a result of the opposition from one of the founding members , Cathay Pacific Airways , whose home base is in Hong Kong which is very close to Guangzhou .

China Southern Airlines is the only Chinese airline to order and to operate the Airbus A380 .
The airline initially operated these aircraft on Beijing – Hong Kong and Beijing – Guangzhou routes .
However , these services struggled to be profitable .
Due to the demand limitation of the airlines ' international hub at Guangzhou Baiyun Airport , few routes from Guangzhou have the demand to support an A380 .
In effort to make its A380s viable , China Southern started operating A380 on its Guangzhou – Los Angeles route and on the Guangzhou –
Sydney route .
Now the A380 comes to Sydney every summer ( southern hemisphere ) during its peak travel period .
As from 20 June 2015 , China Southern will operate the Airbus A380 from Beijing to Amsterdam .
The A380 also operates 4 domestic flights each day between Beijing and Guangzhou .

In 2013 , the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) ordered China Southern Airlines to pay $ 11,600 in fines for violations of the Animal Welfare Act ( AWA ) during the airline 's transport of monkeys to laboratories in the United States .
The USDA found the airline had transported more than 1,000 monkeys into the United States without federal permission to do so and had transported the animals in insecure crates .
Previously , the airline had been ordered to pay $ 14,438 for AWA violations during one transport that left more than a dozen monkeys dead after they went without food and water for an extended period of time .
Following these most recent violations , China Southern announced that it would no longer transport monkeys to laboratories .
PETA had protested against the airline for these shipments .
