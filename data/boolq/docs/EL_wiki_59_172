JUNCTIONAL RHYTHM Junctional rhythm describes an abnormal heart rhythm resulting from impulses coming from a locus of tissue in the area of the atrioventricular node , the " junction " between atria and ventricles .
Under normal conditions , the heart 's sinoatrial node determines the rate by which the organ beats – in other words , it is the heart 's " pacemaker " .
The electrical activity of sinus rhythm originates in the sinoatrial node and depolarizes the atria .
Current then passes from the atria through the atrioventricular node and into the bundle of His , from which it travels along Purkinje fibers to reach and depolarize the ventricles .
This sinus rhythm is important because it ensures that the heart 's atria reliably contract before the ventricles .
In junctional rhythm , however , the sinoatrial node does not control the heart 's rhythm – this can happen in the case of a block in conduction somewhere along the pathway described above .
When this happens , the heart 's atrioventricular node takes over as the pacemaker .
In the case of a junctional rhythm , the atria will actually still contract before the ventricles ; however , this does not happen by the normal pathway of activation and instead is due to a backwards or retrograde conduction ( conduction comes from the AV node into and through the atria ) .
Junctional rhythm can be diagnosed by looking at an ECG : it usually presents without a P wave or with an inverted P wave .
Retrograde P waves refers to the depolarization from the AV node back towards the SA node .
ACCELERATED JUNCTIONAL RHYTHM Section::::Accelerated Junctional Rhythm .
Accelerated junctional rhythm is when the rhythm of emerged impulses is more than 40 to 60 beats per minute , which is the natural range of the junction .
It happens in some instances such as digoxin toxicity , and usually has a rate of between 60 to 100 bpm .
