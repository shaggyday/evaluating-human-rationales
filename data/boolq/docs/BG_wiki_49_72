GERMANY IN THE EUROVISION SONG
CONTEST Germany has officially participated in every Eurovision Song Contest since its beginning in 1956 , except in 1996 when its entry did not qualify past the audio - only pre‐selection round , and consequently was not seen in the broadcast final and does not count as one of Germany 's 62 appearances .
No other country has been represented as many times .
Along with France , Italy , Spain and the United Kingdom , Germany is one of the " Big Five " countries that are automatically qualified to the final , due to being the largest financial contributors to the European Broadcasting Union .
The final is broadcast in Germany on ARD flagship channel , Das Erste .
Germany has won the contest twice , in and .
Germany first won the contest at the 27th attempt in 1982 in Harrogate , when Nicole won with the song " Ein bisschen Frieden " ( A Little Peace ) .
The second German victory came 28 years later at the 2010 contest in Oslo , when Lena won with " Satellite " .
Katja Ebstein , who finished third in and , then second in , is the only performer to have made the top three on three occasions .
Germany has a total of 11 top three placements , also finishing second with Lena Valaitis ( ) and twice with the group Wind ( 1985 and 1987 ) , and finishing third with Mary Roos ( 1972 ) , Mekado ( 1994 ) and Surpriz ( 1999 ) .
Germany has finished last on seven occasions , receiving nul points in , and .
Having not reached the top - ten in ten of the previous 13 contests ( 2005–17 ) , Michael Schulte achieved Germany 's second - best result of the 21st century , by finishing fourth at the contest .
Although German contestants have had varied levels of success , public interest remains high and the contest is one of the most watched events each year .
ORGANISATION Section::::Organisation .
Since 1996 , ARD consortium member Norddeutscher Rundfunk ( NDR ) has been responsible for Germany 's participation in the contest .
The Eurovision Song Contest semi - final is broadcast on NDR Fernsehen ( EinsFestival and Phoenix in recent years ) , and the final is broadcast on Das Erste , the flagship channel of ARD .
The German representative in the contest is usually chosen during a national selection , broadcast on public television channel Das Erste , which is organized by one of the nine regional public broadcasting organizations of the ARD ; from 1956 to 1978 , Hessischer Rundfunk ( HR ) ; from 1979 to 1991 Bayerischer Rundfunk ( BR ) ; from 1992 to 1995 , by Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk ( MDR ) and since 1996 , by Norddeutscher Rundfunk ( NDR ) .
Between 2010 and 2012 , private broadcaster ProSieben worked in partnership with NDR .
Radio coverage has been provided , although not every year , by Deutschlandfunk ( DLF ) and Bayern 2 from 1970 to 1979 , hr3 from 1980–85 , 1991–94 , 2007 and 2011 ( both stations in 1983 ) , NDR Radio 2 from 1986 to 1990 , 1995 to 2006 and 2008–13 , and WDR1LIVE in 2011 .
Since 2010 production company Brainpool , which also co - produced the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest in Düsseldorf and the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest in Baku , have worked with NDR to co - produce the German national finals .
Germany has often changed the selection process used in order to find the country 's entry for the contest , either a national final or internal selection ( occasionally a combination of both formats ) has been held by the broadcaster at the time .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Before German reunification , the country was occasionally presented as West Germany , representing the Federal Republic of Germany .
The German Democratic Republic ( East Germany ) did not participate in the Eurovision Song Contest but instead took part in the Intervision Song Contest .
With one win ( ) and four second - place results ( , , and ) , Germany is the second most successful country in the contest in the 1980s , behind Ireland , who had two wins in the decade .
1996
ABSENCE
Section::::1996 absence .
ARD had selected an artist and song to represent them at the Eurovision Song Contest 1996 , to be held in Oslo , Norway .
Due to the large number of countries wanting to compete at Eurovision , they determined that only 23 of the 30 countries could compete .
Hosts Norway qualified automatically , the other 29 songs went into an audio only pre - qualification round , with the top 22 going on to compete alongside Norway in Oslo .
Unfortunately for Germany its entry , Leon with " Planet of Blue " , failed to earn enough points to progress to the final , finishing 24th .
ARD and the EBU were not happy with this , as Germany was the biggest financial contributor at the time .
This is the only time that Germany has been absent from the contest .
2000S
Section::::2000s .
In the 2000s , Germany has been notable for their adoption of musical styles which are not typical of Eurovision , such as country and western ( Texas Lightning – "
No No
Never " in 2006 ) and swing ( Roger Cicero – "
Frauen regier'n die Welt " in 2007 and Alex Swings Oscar Sings – " Miss Kiss Kiss Bang " in 2009 ) .
Germany tied for last at the 2008 contest for points , but was awarded 23rd of 25th place when the results were posted .
In 2009 , ARD held an internal selection for the first time since 1995 due to lack of interest and viewing figures of the German national finals .
Alex Christensen and Oscar Loya were selected to represent Germany at the 2009 contest , where they performed on stage with famous burlesque artist Dita von Teese .
However they only managed to receive 35 points , placing 20th of 25 competing countries .
2010S Section::::2010s .
In 2010 , ARD approached former entrant and songwriter Stefan Raab and private network ProSieben to co - operate in finding a winning entry for the country .
It has been said that Raab was approached due to his good record at the contest , finishing 5th in 2000 as well as writing entries in 1998 and 2004 , which finished 7th and 8th respectively .
Raab agreed and conducted a TV casting show called Unser Star für Oslo ( Our star for Oslo ) which was broadcast on ARD and ProSieben .
A winner arose in Lena Meyer - Landrut with " Satellite " , who went on to win the contest .
Two further collaborations with ProSieben provided the second and third top ten result in a row respectively in 2011 ( Lena Meyer - Landrut with " Taken by a Stranger " ) and 2012 ( Roman Lob with " Standing Still " ) .
The streak of top 10 finishes was broken in the 2013 contest , when Cascada 's song " Glorious " finished 21st with 18 points .
The group Elaiza in 2014 , Ann Sophie in 2015 , Jamie - Lee and Levina finished in 18th , 27th ( last ) , 26th ( last ) and 25th ( second to last ) place respectively .
Ann Sophie became the country 's third entry to finish with nul points , followed by Nora Nova in 1964 and Ulla Wiesner in 1965 , and the first since the introduction of the current scoring system in 1975 .
Germany 's luck changed in 2018 , when Michael Schulte brought them back to the top 5 for the first time since 2010 with " You Let Me Walk Alone , " finishing in fourth place .
This is the first time since 2012 that more than one country from the Big 5 has made the top ten ( with Italy finishing fifth ) and the second time ( after 2002 ) that two Big 5 countries have made the top five since the establishment of the rule .
GERMANY AND THE " BIG FIVE " Section::::Germany and the " Big Five " .
Since 1998 , four particular countries have automatically qualified for the Eurovision final , regardless of their positions on the scoreboard in previous Contests .
They earned this special status by being the four biggest financial contributors to the EBU .
These countries are the United Kingdom , Germany , France and Spain .
Due to their untouchable status in the Contest , these countries became known as the " Big Four "
In 2009 , it was reported that the Big Four could lose their status and have to compete in the semi - finals .
However , this never progressed and the Big Four kept their status .
Italy returned to the contest in 2011 , thus becoming part of a " Big Five " .
