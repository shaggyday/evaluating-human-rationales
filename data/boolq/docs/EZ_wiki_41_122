This marked the final season for All - Star guard Michael Jordan , who retired for the third and final time .

MICHAEL JORDAN Section::::Michael Jordan .
Jordan announced he would return for the 2002–03 season , and this time he was determined to be equipped with reinforcements , as he traded for All - Star Jerry Stackhouse and signed budding star Larry Hughes .
Jordan even accepted a sixth - man role on the bench in order for his knee to survive the rigors of an 82-game season .
However , a combination of numerous team injuries and uninspired play led to Jordan 's return to the starting lineup , where he tried to rebound the franchise from its early - season struggles .
The move led to mixed results , as several of Jordan 's younger teammates complained about playing in Jordan 's shadow and his unfair expectations of them .
By the end of the season , the Wizards finished with a 37 - 45 record once again .
Jordan ended the season as the only Wizard to play in all 82 games , as he averaged 20.0 points , 6.1 rebounds , 3.8 assists , and 1.5 steals in 37.0 minutes per game .
After the season , Wizards ' majority owner Abe Pollin fired Jordan as team president , much to the shock of teammates , associates , and the public .
Michael Jordan felt he was betrayed , thinking that he would get his ownership back after his playing days ended , but Pollin justified Jordan 's dismissal by noting that Jordan had detrimental effects on the team , such as benching Larry Hughes for Tyronn Lue , making poor trades , and squandering the teams ' 2001 1st round draft pick on high schooler Kwame Brown who never panned out .
Without Michael in the fold the following year , the Washington Wizards were not expected to win , and they did n't .
Despite the signing of future All - Star point guard Gilbert Arenas , which had been made possible by Jordan 's previous cap - clearing maneuvers as a team executive , the team stumbled to a 25 - 57 record in the 2003 - 04 season .
Jordan 's stint with the Washington Wizards was closely watched by both fans and the media .
While the team failed to qualify for the playoffs in either of Jordan 's two seasons as a player , the team was competitive and sold out arenas around the league .
The Wizards replaced Jordan 's managerial role with General Manager Ernie Grunfeld .
Though the organization fielded a competitive team built around Gilbert Arenas for several years , the team again stumbled into the lower echelon of the league in the years following Arenas ' numerous off the court issues .
