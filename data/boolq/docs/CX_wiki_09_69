HISTORY Section::::History .
Palm Beach State College was founded in 1933 as Palm Beach Junior College and was the first public junior college in the state of Florida .
The college 's first classes were held at Palm Beach High School in West Palm Beach .
County school superintendent Joe Youngblood and Howell Watkins , principal of Palm Beach High School , who became the college 's first dean , were instrumental in opening the college .
The college 's initial goal was to provide additional training to local high school graduates who were unable to find jobs during the Great Depression .
In 1948 , Palm Beach Junior College moved to Morrison Field , a deactivated Army Air Force base , which is now Palm Beach International Airport .
In 1951 , the college relocated to the Lake Park Town Hall .
Due to the limited availability of space at the town hall , the college had to lay off faculty and staff and cut enrollment to 200 students .
During this period , Palm Beach Junior College was known as " the little orphan college . "
In 1955 , the Palm Beach County Commission gave the college in Lake Worth , and the state legislature passed a bill providing over $ 1,000,000 for construction at this site .
The college moved to this location , which remains its main campus , in the fall of 1956 .
In 1965 , Palm Beach Junior College merged with Roosevelt Junior College , which was established in 1958 under President Britton Sayles to serve African American students .

In 1978 , the college opened its Belle Glade campus .
The Palm Beach Gardens campus opened in 1982 .
In 1983 , the college opened a campus adjacent to Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton .
In 1988 , the college 's board of trustees changed the college 's name to Palm Beach Community College .
The District Board of Trustees approved a resolution in June 2009 stating that the college 's name should change in light of offering baccalaureate degrees .
On September 8 , 2009 , the Board approved changing the name to Palm Beach State College .
The new name officially took effect on January 12 , 2010 .
