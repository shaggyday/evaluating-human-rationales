PORT MANN BRIDGE
The Port Mann Bridge is a 10-lane cable - stayed bridge that opened to traffic in 2012 .
It is currently the second longest cable - stayed bridge in North America and was the widest bridge in the world until the opening of the new Bay Bridge in California .
The cable - stayed bridge replaced a steel arch bridge that spanned the Fraser River , connecting Coquitlam to Surrey in British Columbia near Vancouver .
After its successor was opened to traffic , the old bridge was demolished by reverse construction .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The original Port Mann Bridge opened on June 12 , 1964 .
It was named after the community of Port Mann , through which the south end of the bridge passed .
The old bridge consisted of three spans with an orthotropic deck carrying five lanes ( originally four lanes ) of Trans - Canada Highway traffic , with approach spans of three steel plate girders and concrete deck .
The total length of the arch bridge was , including approach spans .
The main span was , plus the two spans on either side .
Volume on the old bridge was 127,000 trips per day .
Approximately 8 percent of the traffic on the Port Mann bridge was truck traffic .
The old bridge was the longest arch bridge in Canada and third - longest in the world at the time of its inauguration .
At the time of construction , it was the most expensive piece of highway in Canada .
The first " civilian " to drive across the bridge was CKNW reporter Marke Raines .
He was not authorized to cross , so he drove quickly .
In 2001 an eastbound HOV lane was added by moving the centre divider and by cantilevering the bridge deck outwards in conjunction with a seismic upgrade .
REPLACEMENT Section::::Replacement .
On January 31 , 2006 , the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation introduced the Gateway Program as a means to address growing congestion .
The project originally envisioned twinning the Port Mann Bridge by building a second bridge adjacent to it , but the project was changed to building a 10-lane replacement bridge , planned to be the widest in the world , and demolishing the original bridge .
While the old bridge was found to be in " excellent shape , it is a fracture - critical structure with a tension member that runs the full length of the bridge .
If that fractures anywhere , the bridge 's structural safety can be compromised heavily ...
There is no built - in redundancy [ in this type of bridge ] .
It only takes a little undetected fatigue crack to grow for 10 years and then a member eventually just snaps through one cold morning when the wrong size truck rolls over it " .
OPPOSITION TO TWINNING PLAN Section::::Opposition to twinning plan .
A number of groups lobbied to improve public transit rather than build a new bridge .
Burnaby city council , Vancouver city council , and directors of the GVRD ( now Metro Vancouver ) passed resolutions opposing the Port Mann / Highway 1 expansion .
Opponents of the expansion included local environmental groups , urban planners , and Washington State 's Sightline Institute .
Opponents argued that increasing highway capacity would increase greenhouse gas emissions and only relieve congestion for a few years before increased traffic congested the area again , and that expanding road capacity would encourage suburban sprawl .
The Livable Region Coalition urged the Minister of Transportation , Kevin Falcon , to consider rapid transit lines and improved bus routes instead of building the new bridge .
The David Suzuki Foundation claimed the plan violated the goals of Metro Vancouver 's Livable Region Strategic Plan .
CONSTRUCTION AND COST Section::::Construction and cost .
The Port Mann / Highway 1 project added another HOV lane and will provide cycling and pedestrian access .
The multi - use pedestrian / bicycle path opened July 1 , 2015 .
A bus service was reintroduced over the Port Mann Bridge for the first time in over 20 years .
However , critics claimed that the new bridge only delayed the reintroduction of bus service on the bridge .
The new bus rapid transit service is now operated in the HOV lanes along Highway 1 from Langley to Burnaby .
The estimated construction cost was $ 2.46 billion , including the cost of the Highway 1 upgrade , a total of .
Of this , the bridge itself comprised roughly a third ( $ 820 million ) .
The total cost , including operation and maintenance , was expected to be $ 3.3 billion .
Now that the new bridge is completed , the existing bridge , which was more than 45 years old , has been taken down .
The project was intended to be funded by using a public - private partnership , and Connect B.C. Development Group was chosen as the preferred developer .
The Connect B.C. Group included the Macquarie Group , Transtoll Inc. , Peter Kiewit Sons Co. , and Flatiron Constructors .
Although a memorandum of understanding had been signed by the province , final terms could not be agreed upon .
As a consequence , the province decided to fund the entire cost of replacement .
On September 18 , 2012 , the new Port Mann Bridge opened to eastbound traffic .
At wide , it was the world 's widest long - span bridge , according to the Guinness World Records , overtaking the world - famous Sydney Harbour Bridge , which , at , held the record since 1932 .
DEMOLITION OF ORIGINAL BRIDGE Section::::Demolition of original bridge .
Demolition by detonation would have been much quicker but could have potentially impacted the river which is busy shipping route and has large fish stocks , so the reverse construction option was chosen instead .
Work to dismantle the old Port Mann Bridge began in December 2012 .
Crews removed sections of the bridge piece by piece in opposite order in which they were originally constructed , starting with the road deck , followed by the bridge approach 's girders , and concluding with the steel arch .
It was fully removed by October 2015 .
NEW BRIDGE Section::::New bridge .
The new bridge is long , up to wide , carries 10 lanes of traffic , and has a clearance above the river 's high water level ( the same length and clearance as the old bridge ) .
The towers are approximately tall above deck level , with the total height approximately from top of footing .
The main span ( between the towers ) is long , the second longest cable - stayed span in the western hemisphere .
The main bridge ( between the end of the cables ) has a length of with two towers and 288 cables .
The new bridge was built to accommodate the future installation of light rapid transit .
ISSUES Section::::Issues .
On February 10 , 2012 , during construction of the replacement bridge , an overhead gantry crane collapsed , causing a 90-tonne concrete box - girder segment to drop into the water below .
While no one was injured , the accident delayed subsequent construction .
WorkSafeBC inspectors evaluated the safety practices on the construction site .
On December 19 , 2012 , cold weather caused ice to accumulate on the supporting cables , periodically dropping to the car deck below , dubbed " ice bombs " .
ICBC , the vehicle insurance entity in British Columbia , reported 60 separate claims of ice damage during the incident .
In addition , one driver required an ambulance due to injuries .
The RCMP closed the bridge between 1:30 p.m. and 6 p.m. while engineers investigated .
The Government installed collars on the cables that are manually released when conditions for ice accumulation are expected .
They are installed on the tops of the cables on the towers and are released , falling down the cables by gravity to remove any snow build up .
During December 2016 , " slush bombs " affected the bridge again though the BC Government stated that these were n't as severe as the 2012 " ice bombs . "
During December , the bridge was closed due to the threat of falling snow off of the cables and possible icy conditions .
TOLLING
( 2012–2017 ) Section::::Tolling ( 2012–2017 ) .
In order to recover construction and operating costs , the bridge was electronically tolled when originally built .
The toll rates increased to $ 1.60 for motorcycle , $ 3.15 for cars , $ 6.30 for small trucks and $ 9.45 for large trucks on August 15 , 2015 .
Through increased prices and greater traffic , Transportation Investment Corporation ( TI Corp ) , the public Crown corporation responsible for toll operations on the Port Mann Bridge , forecast its revenue would grow by 85 % between fiscal years 2014 and 2017 .
These fees were assessed using radio - frequency identification ( RFID ) decals or licence plate photos .
A B.C. licensed driver who owes more than $ 25 in tolls outstanding 90 days is penalized $ 20 and is unable to purchase vehicle insurance or renew drivers permits without payment of the debt .
Out - of - province drivers were also contacted for payment by a US - based contractor .
A licence plate processing fee of $ 2.30 per trip was added to the toll rate for unregistered users who did not pay their toll within seven days of their passage .
Monthly passes , which allowed unlimited crossing on the bridge , were available for purchase .
Users may have set up an account for online payment of tolls .
Users who opted for this method received a decal with an embedded RFID to place on their vehicle 's windshield or headlight and avoid paying a processing fee .
Tolls were expected to be removed by the year of 2050 or after collecting $ 3.3 billion .
As announced by B.C. Premier John Horgan a few days earlier , all tolls on the Port Mann Bridge were removed on September 1 , 2017 .
Debt service was transferred to the province of British Columbia at a cost of $ 135 million per year . !
