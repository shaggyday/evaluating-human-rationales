1,000,000,000 1,000,000,000 ( one billion , short scale ; one thousand million or milliard , yard , long scale ) is the natural number following 999,999,999 and preceding 1,000,000,001 .
One billion can also be written as b or bn .
In scientific notation , it is written as 1 × 10 .
The metric prefix giga indicates 1,000,000,000 times the base unit .
Its symbol is G. One billion years may be called eon / aeon in astronomy or geology .
Previously in British English ( but not in American English ) , the word " billion " referred exclusively to a million millions ( 1,000,000,000,000 ) .
However , this is no longer as common as earlier , and the word has been used to mean one thousand million ( 1,000,000,000 ) for some time .
The alternative term " one thousand million " is mainly used in the U.K. , or countries such as Spain that uses " one thousand million " as one million million constitutes a billion .
The worded figure , as opposed to the numerical figure ( one thousand million/1,000,000,000 ) is used to differentiate between " one thousand million " or " one billion " .
The term milliard can also be used to refer to 1,000,000,000 ; whereas " milliard " is seldom used in English , variations on this name often appear in other languages .
In the South Asian numbering system , it is known as 100 crore or 1 arab .
SENSE OF SCALE Section::::Sense of scale .
The facts below give a sense of how large 1,000,000,000 ( 10 ) is in the context of time according to current scientific evidence : TIME *
10 seconds is 114 days short of 32 calendar years ( ≈ 31.7 years ) .
*
More precisely , a billion seconds is exactly 31 years , 8 months , 2 weeks , 1 day , 17 hours , 46 minutes , and 40 seconds .
* About 10 minutes ago , the Roman Empire was flourishing and Christianity was emerging .
( 10 minutes is roughly 1,901 years . )
* About 10 hours ago , modern human beings and their ancestors were living in the Stone Age ( more precisely , the Middle Paleolithic ) .
( 10 hours is roughly 114,080 years . )
* About 10 days ago , Australopithecus , an ape - like creature related to an ancestor of modern humans , roamed the African savannas .
( 10 days is roughly years . )
* About 10 months ago , dinosaurs walked the Earth during the late Cretaceous .
( 10 months is roughly years . )
* About 10 years — a gigaannus — ago , the first multicellular eukaryotes appeared on Earth .
* About 10 decades ago , galaxies began to appear in the early Universe which was then 3.799 billion years old .
( 10 decades is roughly years . )
*
It takes approximately 95 years to count from one to one billion in a single sitting .
*
The universe is thought to be about 13.8 × 10 years old .
DISTANCE
* 10 inches is , more than halfway around the world and thus sufficient to reach any point on the globe from any other point .
* 10 metres ( called a gigametre ) is almost three times the distance from the Earth to the Moon .
* 10 kilometres ( called a terameter ) is over six times the distance from the Earth to the Sun .
AREA
* A billion square inches would be a square about one half mile on a side .
* A piece of finely woven bed sheet cloth that contained a billion holes would measure about , large enough to cover a moderate sized apartment .
VOLUME
*
There are a billion cubic millimetres in a cubic metre and there are a billion cubic metres in a cubic kilometre .
* A billion grains of table salt or granulated sugar would occupy a volume of about .
* A billion cubic inches would be a volume comparable to a large commercial building slightly larger than a typical supermarket .
WEIGHT
*
Any object that weighs would weigh about as much as 5,525 empty Boeing 747 - 400s .
* A cube of iron that weighs would be on each side .
PRODUCTS
* As of July 2016 , Apple has sold one billion iPhones .
This makes the iPhone one of the most successful product lines in history , surpassing the PlayStation and the Rubik 's Cube .
* As of July 2016 , Facebook has 1.71 billion users .
NATURE
* A small mountain , slightly larger than Stone Mountain in Georgia , United States , would weigh ( have a mass of ) a billion tons .
*
There are billions of worker ants in the largest ant colony in the world , which covers almost of the Mediterranean coast .
*
In 1804 , the world population was one billion .
COUNT Section::::Count .
A is a cube ; B consists of 1000 cubes the size of cube A , C consists of 1000 cubes the size of cube B ; and
D consists of 1000 cubes the size of cube
C.
Thus there are A - sized cubes in C ; and 1,000,000,000 A - sized cubes in D. SELECTED 10-DIGIT NUMBERS ( 1,000,000,001–9,999,999,999 ) 1,000,000,001
