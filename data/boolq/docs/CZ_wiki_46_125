BALL AND SOCKET JOINT
The ball and socket joint ( or spheroid joint ) is a type of synovial joint in which the ball - shaped surface of one rounded bone fits into the cup - like depression of another bone .
The distal bone is capable of motion around an indefinite number of axes , which have one common center .
It enables the bone to move in many places ( nearly all directions ) .
An enarthrosis is a special kind of spheroidal joint in which the socket covers the sphere beyond its equator .
EXAMPLES Section::::Examples .
Examples of this form of articulation are found in the hip , where the round head of the femur ( ball ) rests in the cup - like acetabulum ( socket ) of the pelvis , and in the glenohumeral joint of the shoulder , where the rounded head of the humerus ( ball ) rests in the cup - like glenoid fossa ( socket ) of the shoulder blade .
The shoulder includes a sternoclavicular articulation joint .
