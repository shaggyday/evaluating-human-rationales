PLOT Section::::Plot .
Research scientist Galen Erso and his family are in hiding on the planet Lah'mu when Imperial weapons developer Orson Krennic arrives to press him into completing the Death Star , a moon - sized space station with a superweapon capable of destroying entire planets .
Galen 's wife , Lyra , attempts to confront Krennic , but she is shot dead by Krennic 's Death Troopers while their daughter , Jyn , escapes and is rescued by rebel extremist Saw Gerrera .
Fifteen years later , cargo pilot Bodhi Rook defects from the Empire , taking a holographic message recorded by Galen to Gerrera on the desert moon of Jedha .
After learning about the Death Star from an agent at the Ring of Kafrene trading outpost , Rebel Alliance intelligence officer Cassian Andor frees Jyn from an Imperial transport at Wobani before bringing her to the Rebel leader Mon Mothma , who convinces her to find and rescue Galen
so the Alliance can learn more about the Death Star .
Cassian is covertly ordered to kill Galen rather than extract him .
Jyn , Cassian , and reprogrammed Imperial droid K-2SO travel to the moon of Jedha , where the Empire is removing kyber crystals from the holy city to power the Death Star .
However , Gerrera and his partisans engage in a guerrilla battle against one convoy transporting kyber crystals , and then steal the aforementioned crystals just as Imperial reinforcements arrive .
With the aid of blind spiritual warrior Chirrut Îmwe and his mercenary friend Baze Malbus , Jyn makes contact with Gerrera , who has been holding Rook captive .
Gerrera shows her the message , in which Galen reveals he has secretly built a vulnerability into the Death Star and directs them to retrieve the schematics from an Imperial data bank on the planet Scarif .
On the Death Star , which has entered orbit above the moon of Jedha , Krennic orders a low - powered test shot which destroys Jedha 's capital .
Jyn and her group take Rook and flee the moon , but Gerrera remains to die with the city .
Grand Moff Willhuff Tarkin congratulates Krennic before using Rook 's defection and security leak as a pretext to take control of the project .
Rook leads the group to Galen 's Imperial research facility on the storm covered planet Eadu , where Cassian chooses not to kill Galen .
Jyn makes her presence known moments before Rebel bombers attack the facility .
Galen is fatally wounded and dies in his daughter 's arms , before she escapes with her group on board a stolen Imperial cargo shuttle .
Following the attack , Krennic is summoned by Darth Vader to his palace at Mustafar to answer for the attack on Eadu .
Krennic seeks his support for an audience with the Emperor , but Vader instead orders him to ensure no further breaches occur .
Jyn proposes a plan to steal the Death Star schematics using the Rebel fleet , but fails to gain the Alliance Council 's approval .
Many do n't believe the Death Star exists , and most of those who do feel that victory against the Empire is now impossible .
Frustrated at their inaction , Jyn 's group leads a small squad of volunteers to raid the databank themselves .
Arriving at Scarif on the stolen Imperial shuttle , which Rook dubs " Rogue One " , a disguised Jyn and Cassian enter the base with while the other rebels attack the resident Imperial garrison as a diversion .
The Rebel fleet learns of the raid from intercepted Imperial communications and deploy in support .
K-2SO sacrifices himself
so Jyn and Cassian can retrieve the data .
Îmwe is killed after activating the master switch to allow communication with the Rebel fleet , and Malbus dies in battle shortly afterwards .
During the battle , a shoretrooper throws a thermal detonator inside the stolen cargo shuttle , blowing it up and killing Rook just after he informs the Rebel fleet that they must make an opening in the shield surrounding the planet to allow the transmission of the schematics .
Jyn and Cassian obtain the schematics , but they are ambushed by Krennic , who is eventually shot and wounded by Cassian .
Jyn transmits the schematics to the Rebel command ship .
The Death Star enters orbit above Scarif , where Tarkin uses another low - power shot to destroy the compromised base , killing Krennic , Cassian , Jyn , and anyone still alive on the surface .
The Rebel fleet prepares to jump to hyperspace , but many of its ships are intercepted by Vader 's flagship .
Vader boards the Rebel command ship and attempts to regain the schematics , but a small starship escapes with them .
Aboard the fleeing ship , [ [ Princess Leia ] ] declares that the plans will provide a new hope for the rebellion .

PRODUCTION
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Production .
Section::::Development .
Rogue One is the first film in the [ [ Star Wars ] ]
[ [ List of Star Wars films and television series#Anthology filmsanthology series ] ] , a series of standalone [ [ Spin - off ( media)spin - off ] ] films in the [ [ Star Wars ] ] franchise .
[ [ John Knoll ] ] , visual effects supervisor for the Star Wars prequel trilogy , [ [ Pitch ( filmmaking)pitched ] ]
the idea for the film 10 years before its development ; after the Disney acquisition he felt as if he had to pitch it again or forever wonder " what might 've happened if I had " .
In May 2014 , Disney announced that [ [ Gareth Edwards ( director)Gareth Edwards ] ] would direct the film and [ [ Gary Whitta ] ] would write the script .
That October , cinematographer [ [ Greig Fraser ] ] revealed that he would work on the film .
In January 2015 , it was revealed that Whitta had completed his work on the script , and would no longer be with the project .
[ [ Simon Kinberg ] ] was considered as a replacement .
Later in the month , it was announced that [ [ Chris Weitz ] ] had signed to write the script for the film .
In March 2015 , the title was announced .
Edwards stated that the style of the film would be similar to that of a [ [ war film ] ] , stating , " It 's the reality of war .
Good guys are bad .
Bad guys are good .
It 's complicated , layered ; a very rich scenario in which to set a movie . "
Assuming that Disney would n't allow a dark ending , Edwards had the main characters surviving in the original version of the script , but the producers opted for a more tragic ending and never filmed the original version .
In July 2016 , discussing whether the film would feature an [ [ Star Wars opening crawlopening crawl ] ] , [ [ Kathleen Kennedy ( producer)Kathleen Kennedy ] ] said , " we 're in the midst of talking about it , but I do n't think these [ anthology ] films will have an opening crawl . "
Edwards explained that " The idea is this film is supposed to be different than the saga films , " and that " This film is born out of a crawl . ...
There 's this feeling that if we did a crawl , then it 'll create another movie . "
In November 2016 , Kennedy confirmed that the film would not feature an opening crawl , instead beginning in " a way that is traditional , with just the title . "
At the 2016
[ [ Star Wars CelebrationStar Wars Celebration ] ] , Edwards said the title had three meanings : " a military sign " , referring to the [ [ Red Squadron ] ]
from A New Hope ; " the ' rogue ' one " of the franchise , given that it is the first film to not be part of the main saga ; and a description of [ [ Jyn Erso ] ] 's personality .

at [ [ Mýrdalssandur ] ] , which were used to represent Lah'mu and Eadu .
Also used were the [ [ Krafla ] ] area with its volcanic crater and around [ [ Lake Mývatn ] ] 's rock formations .

POST - PRODUCTION Section::::Post - production .
On February 11 , 2016 , Disney executives stated that the film was " virtually completed " .
Several weeks of pre - scheduled reshoots began in June 2016 .
[ [ Tony Gilroy ] ] , who was an uncredited writer on the film at the time , was hired to direct the reshoots and rework aspects of the film , earning him a screenwriting credit .
[ [ Industrial Light & Magic ] ]
( ILM ) produced the film 's visual effects .
ILM used [ [ Computer - generated imageryCGI ] ] and digitally altered archive footage to insert [ [ Peter Cushing ] ] 's likeness over the body of actor [ [ Guy Henry ( actor)Guy Henry ] ] .
Lucasfilm secured permission from the late actor 's estate to include him in the film .
The team reportedly searched through countless hours of Cushing footage in order to find suitable reference material , and Henry provided the [ [ Motion - capture actingmotion capture ] ] and voice work .
A digital model of Cushing was mapped over Henry 's performance like a digital body mask .
Cushing 's mannerisms , including his manner of speaking , were studied by the creative team and applied to the digital Tarkin model .
Cushing 's family were heavily involved with the creation and had input right down to " small , subtle adjustments " .
A similar process was used in the portrayal of Princess Leia ; Carrie Fisher 's appearance as Leia in the first film was superimposed over Norwegian actress [ [ Ingvild Deila ] ] 's
face and archival audio of Fisher saying " Hope " was used to voice the character .
Post - production wrapped on November 28 , 2016 .
SOUNDTRACK Section::::Soundtrack .
In March 2015 , it was reported that [ [ Alexandre Desplat ] ] , who had worked with Edwards on [ [ Godzilla ( 2014 film)Godzilla ] ] , would compose the score for Rogue One .
Despite rumors that a contract had not been initially set in place by Lucasfilm , Desplat confirmed in an April 2016 interview that he would serve as composer for the film .
Concerning the film , Desplat commented that " [ Edwards and I ] had a great partnership on Godzilla , and I ca n't wait to be starting with him .
It will be in a few weeks from now , and it is very exciting and frightening at the same time because it 's such a legendary project .
To be called to come after John Williams ...
it 's a great challenge for me . "
However , in September 2016 , it was announced that [ [ Michael Giacchino ] ] would be replacing Desplat as composer , after the film 's reshoots altered the post - production schedule , and reportedly left Desplat no longer available .
Giacchino only had four and a half weeks to compose the music for the film , beginning almost immediately after finishing production on [ [ Doctor Strange ( 2016 film)Doctor Strange ] ] .
In an interview with [ [ Entertainment Weekly ] ]
in November 2016 , Giacchino stated : " It is a film that is in many ways a really great [ [ World War II ] ]
movie , and I loved that about it .
But it also has this huge , huge heart at the center of it , and that was the one thing
I just did n't want to discount .
Yes , it 's an action movie , and it 's a Star Wars film , and it has all the things that you would come to expect and love about that , but I did n't want to forget that it was also an incredibly emotional movie as well .
That was what really pulled me in . "
Giacchino incorporated John Williams ' themes from previous films into the score .
The official soundtrack was released by [ [ Walt Disney Records ] ] on December 16 , 2016 .
All music was composed by Giacchino except where noted .
Giacchino , who has a history of using track titles that contain wordplay , shared his alternate list in the liner notes of the soundtrack release .

MARKETING
Section::::Marketing .
Promotion of Rogue One was initially delayed by the release of the film [ [ Mission : Impossible – Rogue Nation ] ]
in July 2015 , because the titles are similar .
[ [ Paramount Pictures ] ] registered and cleared the title with the [ [ Motion Picture Association of America ] ]
in January 2015 , well before Disney announced the title of its forthcoming Star Wars spinoff .
Disney and Lucasfilm had to reach an agreement with Paramount over promotion in order to avoid any confusion in the public mind .
Disney agreed to [ [ embargo ] ] promotion on Rogue One until after mid-2015 , with the exception of a very short teaser which was screened at Star Wars Celebration in Anaheim that year .
A [ [ Teaser campaignteaser trailer ] ]
for Rogue One , released by Lucasfilm on April 7 , 2016 , was praised by reviewers for its portrayal of strong female characters .
[ [ The Daily Telegraph ] ]
described [ [ Jyn Erso ] ] 's character as " a roguish , [ [ Han Solo]]-style heroine " , calling the film " progressive " , while noting its painstaking faithfulness to the [ [ production design ] ]
style of the [ [ Original trilogyoriginal Star Wars trilogy ] ] .
The Hollywood Reporter also noted the visual nods to the original trilogy , and examined the film 's possible narrative direction , considering that the outcome is to some extent already revealed in the opening crawl of [ [ Star Wars ( film)A New Hope ] ] .
[ [ The Atlantic ] ]
writer David Sims stated that the trailer brought " back some memorable pieces of architecture , from the lumbering [ [ AT - ATAT - AT walkers ] ] to the Death Star itself , not to mention the glorious 70s costuming of Star Wars . "
He added that the trailer has " the look " , blending the old with the new .
The trailer was viewed close to 30 million times in its first 29 hours , at a rate of 800,000 views per hour , from Facebook and YouTube , which is 200,000 views shy of what the first teaser trailer for [ [ Star Wars : The Force Awakens ] ] was receiving in November 2014 .
In June 2016 , Rogue One was promoted at the [ [ Star Wars
Celebration#Celebration
Europe IIIStar Wars Celebration Europe III ] ]
event in London .
During the event , a new official poster was unveiled , which depicts a battle taking place on the tropical planet Scarif , with the Death Star looming large in a blue sky , above which is printed the [ [ tagline ] ] "
A Rebellion Built on Hope " .
A second teaser trailer was also unveiled , screened exclusively for the Celebration audience , and not streamed online .
This new trailer was reviewed favorably by critics ; The Daily Telegraph noted that the trailer revealed new locations such as the planets Jedha and Scarif , and that its most significant revelation came in the final seconds of the teaser , with the appearance of Darth Vader , reflected in a computer screen and accompanied by his classic breathing sound effect .
[ [ Variety ( magazine)Variety ] ] also hailed the Vader reveal , and noted that the emphasis of the production was much more on the kinetic depiction of large battle sequences and full - on warfare , comparing it to [ [ Francis Ford Coppola ] ] 's 1979 [ [ Vietnam War ] ]
epic [
[ Apocalypse Now ] ] .
A [ [ showreel ] ] was also shown during the event , which featured footage from the film , cut with behind - the - scenes shots and interviews with the director and cast members .
The second trailer was shown publicly during a broadcast of the [ [ 2016 Summer Olympics ] ] and received favourable media reviews ; [ [ Wired ( magazine)Wired ] ] stated that the trailer was " littered with nostalgic throwbacks to the original trilogy " , while [ [ Rolling Stone ] ]
described the CGI landscape shots seen in the footage as " eye - poppingly gorgeous " .
A further trailer released in October 2016 prompted The Hollywood Reporter to comment that the newly revealed footage looked like " a trailer to a different movie than the one advertised earlier " , remarking that Jyn Erso appeared to be portrayed as a more vulnerable character , and highlighting the appearance of Galen Erso as a protective father figure .
Vanity Fair also commented on the emphasis given to Jyn 's relationship with her father , suggesting that Rogue One was drawing on " the Star Wars franchise 's greatest natural resource :
[ [ daddy issues ] ] " .
The film 's publicity tour began in Mexico on November 23 , 2016 .
In Asia , Disney focused marketing efforts on [ [ Donnie Yen ] ] , where his individual poster is used for marketing in territories including Japan , Singapore , Indonesia , Thailand , [ [ Hong Kong ] ] , China , Vietnam and Malaysia .
The official [ [ Star Wars ] ]
Facebook page of the respective Asian countries also featured clips and videos of Donnie Yen speaking various languages , greeting fans and telling them to support the film .
In addition , Disney also released various versions of international trailers with more footage of Yen .

But the film is bogged down in engineering the complex maneuverings of spy games , [ [ dogfight]]s , and the most sprawling Rebel - versus - Empire land battle scene since the opening of [ [ The Empire Strikes Back ] ] . "
Justin Chang , writing for the [ [ Los Angeles Times ] ] , called Rogue One " a swiftly paced , rough - and - ready entertainment .
"
[ [ The New York Times ] ]
wrote , " All the pieces are there , in other words , like [ [ Lego ] ] figures in a box .
The problem is that the filmmakers have n't really bothered to think of anything very interesting to do with them .
A couple of 9-year - olds on a screen - free rainy afternoon would come up with better adventures , and probably also better dialogue . "
[ [ Richard Brody ] ]
of [ [ The New Yorker ] ] called the film " lobotomized and " depersonalized " , and wrote it " is n't so much a movie as a feature - length promotional film for itself ; it 's a movie that is still waiting to be made . "
[ [ The Washington Post ] ]
wrote " Rogue One represents an unobjectionable exercise in franchise extension .
It 's fine .
It 'll do .
For now . " [ [ IndieWire ] ] 's David Ehrlich gave the film a C+ rating , calling it " a spirited but agonizingly safe attempt to expand cinema 's most holy blockbuster franchise and keep the wheels greased between proper installments [ ... ]
just a glorified excuse to [ [ Retroactive continuityretcon ] ]
some sense into one of the silliest things about the original .
" While he praised the set design and visuals , calling them " gorgeous " , he criticized a lack of interesting character development and a script that felt " completely constricted by its purpose . " Peter Bradshaw , film critic of [ [ The Guardian ] ]
says " Rogue One does n't really go rogue at any stage , and it is n't a pop culture event like The Force Awakens , in whose slipstream this appears ; part of its charm resides in the eerie , almost dreamlike effect of continually producing familiar elements , reshuffled and reconfigured , a reaching back to the past and hinting at a preordained future .
There are some truly spectacular cameos from much - loved personae , involving next - level digital effects — almost creepily exact , so that watching feels at various stages like going into a time machine , back to the 80s and 70s " .
Rogue One introduced many new characters into the Star Wars mythology , with Chirrut Îmwe , played by [ [ Donnie Yen ] ] , and K-2SO , played by [ [ Alan Tudyk ] ] , being the most popular .
Yen 's performance , in particular , was also applauded by audiences worldwide .
In a poll on the official Star Wars website in May 2017 , in which more 30,000 people voted , Chirrut Îmwe was voted as the most popular Rogue One character .
VIEWS ON CGI Section::::Views on CGI .
While much of the [ [ computer - generated imagery ] ]
( CGI ) received praise , some news organizations published criticism about certain aspects , including the [ [ visual effects ] ]
( VFX ) that were used to revive [ [ Peter Cushing ] ] , who had died in 1994 , as [ [ Grand Moff Tarkin ] ] .
The Guardians Catherine Shoard described the " resurrection " as a " digital indignity " .
Joseph Walsh of The Guardian raised legal and ethical issues about bringing a long - dead actor to life .
However , Lucasfilm had obtained permission from Peter Cushing 's estate before deciding to use his likeness .
The Washington Timess Eric Althoff rejected the entire concept of using CGI to recreate a deceased actor : " Alas , what we get is , basically , not a simulation , but an approximation of a simulation — a dead character portrayed by a living actor inhabiting not the character , but imitating the dead actor . "
Some journalists also criticized the quality of the CGI that was used to represent a younger Carrie Fisher in order to portray Princess Leia at an earlier time , as well as its suitability in movie - making .
Eliana Dockterman of Time wrote that " there was something particularly plastic about this version of the young Carrie Fisher — so smooth and so perfect it could n't be real — that pulled me out of the moment . "
Kelly Lawler of [ [ USA Today ] ] said : " ... while Tarkin is merely unnerving , the Leia cameo is so jarring as to take the audience completely out of the film at its most emotional moment .
Leia 's appearance was meant to help the film end on a hopeful note ( quite literally , as ' hope ' is her line ) , but instead it ends on a weird and unsettling one . "
Michael Cavna of [ [ The Washington Post ] ] described the facial effect as feeling " distractingly artificial and nearly alien , like a plastered death mask robbed of authentic actorly effect , well beyond the usual artifice of [ [ Botulinum toxinBotox ] ] .
" Nonetheless , Fisher was shown the CGI rendition of her younger self for the film by Kathleen Kennedy and " loved it . "
