METLIFE STADIUM MetLife Stadium is a multi - purpose stadium located in East Rutherford , New Jersey , outside of New York City .
It is part of the Meadowlands Sports Complex and serves as the home stadium for two National Football League ( NFL ) franchises : the New York Giants and the New York Jets .
The stadium is owned by the MetLife Stadium Company , a joint venture of the Giants and Jets , who jointly built the stadium using private funds on land owned by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority .
The stadium opened as New Meadowlands Stadium in 2010 .
In 2011 , MetLife , an insurance company based in New York City , acquired the naming rights to the stadium .
At a construction cost of approximately $ 1.6 billion , it was the most expensive stadium ever built , at the time it opened .
MetLife Stadium is the only NFL stadium shared by two clubs since the 2000s .
Los Angeles ' Staples Center , which is home to the Clippers and the Lakers of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) , is the only other facility to currently house two teams from the same sports league in the United States .
HISTORY Section::::History .
As Giants Stadium approached 30 years of age , it was becoming one of the older stadiums in the NFL .
The Jets , who had been the lesser tenants at the stadium ( which was called simply " The Meadowlands " for Jets games ) , sought to have their own stadium built in Manhattan proper , the proposed West Side Stadium .
Originally intended to be the 85,000-seat main stadium for New York 's bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics , it was designed to be downsized to 75,000 seats for the Jets .
However , the West Side Stadium would have required significant public funding , which collapsed in 2005 .
The Jets then entered into a joint venture with the Giants to build a new stadium in which the two teams would be equal partners .
DESIGN Section::::Design .
The architects were tasked with designing a neutral stadium that would still embody the distinct personalities of both franchises .
The Giants favored a traditional look of exposed steel framework and rusticated stone while the Jets wanted a sleek and modern look highlighted by metal and glass .
With those features in mind the designers used the column / tower dynamic seen in many of Manhattan 's skyscrapers as inspiration for the stadium 's design .
The base of the stadium 's facade is clad in limestone - like stonework while the rest of the stadium is distinguished by an outer skin of aluminum louvers and glass and by interior lighting capable of switching colors , depending on which team is currently playing â€“ blue for the Giants and green for the Jets .
This idea originated at the Allianz Arena in Munich , Germany ; which is shared between the city 's two major soccer clubs , Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich .
Unlike Giants Stadium , MetLife Stadium can easily be reconfigured for the Giants or Jets within a matter of hours .
The total linear length of louvers is exactly 50,000 meters ( 50 kilometers ) or 163,681 feet ( 31.1 miles ) .
Front row 50 yard line seats are away from the sideline , which is the shortest distance of all NFL stadiums .
To change the field decorations , two 4-person crews take approximately 18 hours using forklifts and other machinery to remove the 40 sections of Act Global UBU Speed Series which make up the teams ' respective endzones .
Unlike most NFL stadiums , the NFL 's logo is painted at midfield , instead of the logo of one of the teams , also shortening the transition time .
The replaceable team logos at midfield were removed in August 2010 , after Domenik Hixon tore his anterior cruciate ligament at a practice at the stadium during training camp .
Unlike a number of other new NFL venues , MetLife Stadium does not have a roof , as proposals to include a roof failed , over a dispute for funding .
Thus , indoor events such as the Final Four can not be held at the facility , which runs counter to the original aims for a new stadium in northern New Jersey .
10 giant high - definition - ready light emitting diode ( LED ) pylons , located at the north , south , east and west entrances , display videos of the team currently in - house .
The pylons measure approximately high by wide .
Inside , are four by high definition video displays , and hang from each corner of the upper deck .
The new stadium seating bowl is laid out similar to that of Giants Stadium and has seating for 82,500 people , including 10,005 club seats and approximately 218 luxury suites , making it the largest NFL stadium in terms of total seating .
The seating bowl is also raked in a way that eliminates overhangs from the upper decks that would impede views and allows fans to see the full arc of a 90-foot punt . !
Lower bowl !
Mid - bowl !
Upper bowl MetLife Stadium includes a total of four locker rooms : one each for the Giants and Jets , as well as 2 for visiting teams .
The home teams have locker rooms on opposite ends of the stadium with a visitors ' locker room adjacent to it ; the unused visitors ' locker room is used for spillover by the home team , on game days .
In 2012 , DLR Group partnered with NRG Energy to design and install a " Solar Ring " on the upper rim of MetLife Stadium .
The Solar Ring consists of 1,350 building integrated photovoltaic ( BIPV ) solar panels assembled into 47 individual frames .
The BIPV panels are illuminated with LED lighting and programmed to display the signature blue and green colors of the Giants and the Jets along with other hues for events such as concerts , soccer matches and college sports .
The panels generate about 350 KW , nearly 25 times the amount of electricity that 's actually needed to power the LED display system .
The excess power generated can go into the general stadium use or back to the grid .
TECHNICAL AGREEMENTS
LEASE TERMS Section::::Technical agreements .
Section::::Lease terms .
The two teams formed the New Meadowlands Stadium Company , LLC ( now MetLife Stadium Company ) , a 50/50 joint venture , to build and operate the stadium .
The two teams leased the parcel of land on which the stadium stands from the NJSEA for a 25-year term , with options to extend it which could eventually reach 97 years .
After the 15th year of the lease , and every five years , hence ; one of the 2 teams may opt out of the lease after giving the state 12 months notice .
However , if one team leaves for a new stadium , the other team would have to remain for the remainder of the lease .
Based on the teams ' histories , this clause presumably allows the Jets to eventually decide they want to play in their own stadium and leave if they can find a way to finance it .
However , the high cost of building and relocating to a new stadium makes this very unlikely ( although the Jets have relocated their facilities to Florham Park , New Jersey ) .
The teams also get parking revenue from the Meadowlands ' western parking lots year round , even when there are no events at the stadium ( this would occur when other parts of the Meadowlands host events ) .
NAMING RIGHTS
Section::::Naming rights .
Allianz , a financial services and insurance company based in Germany , expressed interest in purchasing naming rights to the stadium .
The proposal was for a period of up to 30 years , and was estimated to be valued at between $ 20 million and US$ 30 million .
However , it sparked protests from New York 's Jewish community ( the largest outside of Israel ) and the Anti - Defamation League , which opposed the move due to close ties in the past between Allianz and the government of Nazi Germany during World War II .
Rabbi Jay Rosenbaum , however , secretary general of the North American Board of Rabbis , agreed that although survivors ' sensibilities are understandable , a naming deal is legitimate .
" I have found Allianz to be receptive , to be sensitive and a friend of the Jewish people today , " he said .
Allianz sponsors the venue that inspired the color - change technology for MetLife Stadium :
Allianz Arena in Munich .
No agreement was reached and talks between Allianz and the teams ended on September 12 , 2008 .
On June 27 , 2011 , it was reported that insurance company MetLife entered discussions to purchase naming rights to the stadium .
The new name , MetLife Stadium , became official when all parties signed a 25-year deal on August 23 .
EPA AGREEMENT Section::::EPA agreement .
In June 2009 , the New Meadowlands Stadium Corporation and the EPA signed a memorandum of understanding that outlines plans to incorporate environmentally - friendly materials and practices into the construction and operation of MetLife Stadium .
The agreement includes strategies to reduce air pollution , conserve water and energy , improve waste management , and reduce the environmental impact of construction .
The goal of the agreement is to save the emission of nearly 1.68 million metric tons of carbon dioxide during the stadium 's construction and its first year of operation .
Under this agreement , the stadium construction must use around 40,000 tons of recycled steel , recycle 20,000 tons of steel from Giants Stadium , install seating made from recycled plastic and scrap iron , and reduce air pollution from construction vehicles by using cleaner diesel fuel , diesel engine filters , and minimizing engine idle times .
Other goals of this agreement include providing mass transit options for fans and replacing traditional concession plates , cups and carries with compostable alternatives .
The New Meadowlands Stadium Corporation is to report the progress on its goals to EPA every six months .
Based on the reports , the EPA has stated it will quantify the benefits of the venue 's environmental efforts .
ACCESSIBILITY AND TRANSPORTATION Section::::Accessibility and transportation .
MetLife Stadium is accessible by car via Exit 16W on the western spur of the New Jersey Turnpike ( I-95 ) and is also located adjacent to NJ Route 3 and NJ Route 120 .
