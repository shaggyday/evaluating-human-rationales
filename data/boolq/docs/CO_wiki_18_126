MADEA Mabel " Madea " Simmons was a character created and portrayed by Tyler Perry .
The character was a tough elderly black woman .
Vindictive in nature , Madea gets even in a bad way .
When asked why she felt the need to get somebody all the time , Madea answered : " Well when you gettin ' got and somebody done got you and you go get them , when you get 'em , everybody 's gon ' get got . "
Additionally , Madea has a tendency to overreact and is willing to threaten to use deadly weapons , destroy property , use physical violence , take on the law , and use any and all means necessary to show up an offending party .
Incorrigible in her overreactive ways , Madea has repeatedly landed herself in court ( usually before Judge Mablean ) , anger management classes , house arrest , and even prison .
Despite her questionable methods , she stands for what 's right and has a nurturing side .
As examples , Madea is often seen officiously involving herself in circumstances in which others have been wronged , offering self - defense tips , instruction , or avenging them on her own ; by her very nature , Madea is more than willing to " thug out " on some of the sassiest and brattiest of children and teens , but also shows to care about their well - being in the end .
The character combines an unusual pronunciation style with her locutions , such as " Heller , how ya dern ? " or " Halleluyer praise da lort ! "
Madea is based on Perry 's mother and his aunt , as well Eddie Murphy 's performance in .
In Perry 's own words Madea is " . .
.exactly the PG version of my mother and my aunt , and I loved having an opportunity to pay homage to them .
She would beat the hell out of you but make sure the ambulance got there in time to make sure they could set your arm back . . . "
EARLY YEARS
Section::::Early years .
Mabel " Madea " Simmons was born in Greensburg , Louisiana , on June 26 , 1935 .
( Madea was 68 in the first play , I Can Do Bad All by Myself , as well as Madea 's Class Reunion .
Her ages in the other plays are unknown because they take place between these two plays , and there 's no continuity offered .
In Madea Goes to Jail , Madea was around 75 ) .
In " I Can Do Bad All by Myself , " she reveals she once lived in Cleveland , Ohio , but later returned to Atlanta .
Madea was brought up in poverty and grew up living in shacks with her immediate family .
Madea has stated that although her family did n't have much , they had love .
According to Family Reunion , Madea 's mother , " Big Mabel " Murphy , was a hooker during Madea 's childhood and was n't at all religious .
As a result , Madea grew up with little knowledge of Christianity ( as an elderly woman , Madea has a tendency to misquote the Bible ) .
She attended Booker T. Washington High School , where she served as a cheerleader .
When Madea was 16 , her parents moved her and the rest of her immediate family to Atlanta , Georgia , in a shotgun house .
It was reported in Madea 's book ,
Do n't Make a Black Woman Take Off Her Earrings , that Madea 's mother and father would n't allow her to go out at all until she turned 17 or 18 .
In the films , it has been revealed that Madea used to be a stripper , and her stagenames were Magnitude and Delicious .
It is heavily implied that she was a prostitute as well .
CRIMINAL BACKGROUND Section::::Criminal background .
Madea has a lifelong criminal record that began at age 9 with a charge of petty theft .
It is also reported that Madea was charged with her first felony at this age , and her crimes began progressing to illegal gambling at age 18 , which later evolved into check fraud , identity theft , insurance fraud ( presumably related to her nine deceased husbands ) , assault , attempted murder , vehicle theft ( mostly Lexus vehicles , the first vehicle she ever stole being a 1992 Lexus LS400 ) , reckless driving ( including smashing through objects , notably a mansion gate , a Cadillac CTS , and a fast food window in Diary of a Mad Black Woman , Goes to Jail , and Big Happy Family respectively ) and forklifting vehicles out of parking spaces ( usually for taking spaces that she wants to park at , as she did to many Camrys and Scions , as well as a Pontiac Solstice that she ruined in Madea Goes to Jail ) .
Throughout the series , she is a repeat offender .
In Diary of a Mad Black Woman alone , Madea and her granddaughter Helen McCarter were both charged with " criminal trespassing , reckless endangerment , criminal possession of a handgun , assault with a deadly weapon , [ driving on a ] suspended license , expired registration , reckless driving , and a broken taillight " , which placed Madea on house arrest , while her granddaughter was bailed for $ 5,000 .
In Family Reunion , she violated the terms of house arrest by taking off her house arrest bracelet but was given the opportunity to avoid jail by becoming a foster mother .
In Meet the Browns , Madea was stopped by police as a normal traffic stop , only to refuse to pull over ( fearing that she 'll be sent to jail again ) , which leads her into a high - speed car chase with several law enforcement officials and news helicopters .
In Goes to Jail , Madea was about to get sent to jail , but was reluctantly released by Judge Mablean after learning the arresting officers did not read the Miranda rights warning when she was arrested ( as the officers claimed that Madea was fighting with them ) , so she finally admits that her license was suspended indefinitely ( implying that her license was suspended when she was 30 years old ) and also gets ordered to anger management counseling , making it the very last opportunity for her to avoid jail .
She , however , began driving as soon as Cora neglected her daughterly duties .
Madea 's brother Joe ( also played by Perry ) refers to her as a " po - po ho " , meaning someone who is a professional at evading law enforcement .
In A Madea Christmas , Madea confides in her niece Eileen that she sold " trees " ; when Eileen asks if they were Christmas trees , Madea replies that " when you smoke 'em , they make you feel like it 's Christmas " , implying that she once was a marijuana dealer .
PERSONALITY
HARD SIDE AND LANGUAGE USE
Section::::Personality .
Section::::Hard side and language use .
Scurrilous , wise cracking , and saucy in remarks and behavior , Madea is full of comical sass and vulgar and abusive language .
She also has many catch phrases , such as " You crazy as hell , " and " I oughta punch you in da face ! "
In addition , she uses Ebonics and other various urban expressions .
Madea also intentionally adds a mispronounced " t " sound to many of her words , such as " Africant Americant " , " cooking and cleanting " and " living for da Lort [ Lord ] . " Madea is mostly noted for her outrageous overreactions and thuggish toughness over which she has shown no shame .
For example , the character has four general methods of attack :
* Destruction of property , such as demolishing others ' household appliances with a chainsaw * * Weapon violence , such as stabbing others with a lit cigarette * * Physical violence , such as strangling and pounding others with her bare hands and elbows *
* Intimidation through outrageous browbeating tactics and threats , such as firing off her Glock pistol , which she keeps handy with her in her purse at all times ( from the extended interval of rapid - fire sounds in Madea Goes To Jail , it is implied that she owns a fully automatic assault - rifle , as well , but only brings it out on " special occasions " )
* When using guns , Madea shoots around targets , using intimidation rather than actually killing or injuring anyone .
As another form of intimidation , Madea frequently boasts of having killed in the past .
As an example , she once claimed to have murdered Jimmy Hoffa over him insulting her .
She also claimed to have shot Tupac Shakur while arguing over a parking space ; although she claims not to have killed him in the shooting .

These family members have included her granddaughter Helen ( Diary of a Mad Black Woman film ) , granddaughter Vianne ( I Can Do Bad All by Myself ) , her great niece Vanessa and her two kids ( Madea 's Family Reunion ) , and ex - convict Bobby Mitchell ( I Can Do Bad All by Myself ) .
Quite often , Madea has offered direction and guidance to those who were being abused within their romantic relationships .
Though much of this direction and guidance tends to come in the form of extreme warmongering , Madea 's heart is always in the right place .
Madea also instructs troubled individuals about the mistakes they 've made in their life choices and leads them down the path of forgiveness and improvement .
While in prison in the film Madea Goes to Jail , Madea attends an anger management church meeting under duress .
During the meeting , Madea ends up lecturing all the women to stop playing victims , stop whining , and start taking action to improve their lives .
Madea is mentally strong and offers nurturing advice to struggling individuals whom she cares for .

The film begins with everyone leaving Irene 's funeral .
Madea was shown as not caring much for her sister ; in fact , not only does Madea claim she 's
happy Irene 's died , but she has also said Irene probably died on purpose to get out of repaying Madea a $ 20 loan .
In Madea Goes to Jail , Madea helps out Sonny by letting him stay at her home rent - free .

Section::::Madea 's parenting , husbands , and children .
In Madea Goes to Jail , it was revealed that Madea supported her children by stripping , pole dancing , and professional wrestling , among other things .
Madea has buried nine husbands , among them Jimmy and Johnny .
Madea claims to have shot some of them and poisoned others of them with her sweet potato pie .
After each husband died , they were buried quickly and Madea collected their life insurance checks .
Each time it 's happened , Madea has stated " I 'm tryin ' to get to the insurance company by five , and the casino by nine ! "
First husband :
Johnny SimmonsMadea killed her first husband Johnny Simmons ( deceased ) , the father of Michelle and William .
Madea implies that she was glad when he died and that their marriage was n't good .
Johnny 's niece Vickie appears in Family Reunion ; she is the mother of four sons .
Daughter :
Cora SimmonsMadea 's daughter , Cora Simmons , is her most recognized and only child to appear in most of the plays and movies .
Cora is 50 in Diary of a Mad Black Woman .
She was born in 1953 when Madea was 18 .
Cora is a devout Christian and is often in the company of her father Leroy Brown .
Tina and Lisa only appear in Family Reunion , but are the only granddaughters to be mentioned all the time .
Cora thought that Johnny was her father until Class Reunion , in which Madea reminded Cora that she [ Cora ] was the product of a one - night stand with Leroy Brown during their prom in 1953 .
This suggests that Madea is 62 years old in her first appearance , as well as in Madea 's Class Reunion when her parents attend their 50th class reunion .
Once Cora learned the truth , she became closer to Mr. Brown , visiting his family ( in Meet the Browns ) and taking him to the hospital in What 's Done in the Dark .
Their father / daughter plotline is shown on movies in Meet the Browns , the TV series Tyler Perry 's House of Payne , and its spin - off series Meet the Browns .
In the movie , Madea 's Big Happy Family , Cora enlists the help of Maury Povich to find out if Leroy Brown is in fact her father , after a blood test proves he is not .
DNA tests reveal that Leroy Brown is not the father of Cora .
In Madea 's Big Happy Family there is no apparent relation between Leroy Brown and Cora other than friends .
Son :
William SimmonsWilliam is Madea 's youngest and only son .
Depending on the chronological order of the plays , William could be older than Cora .
William is married to Myrtle .
As far as the plays , Myrtle only appears in the Diary of a Mad Black Woman .
She is , however , mentioned in the
I Can Do Bad All by Myself play .
In the plays , Myrtle is in her 50s .
In the film timeline , Myrtle is in her 70s , and is placed in a retirement home .
This shows a natural propensity to disregard timelines humorously , because Madea herself is only in her mid - seventies .
William and Myrtle have three children : Helen , Jackie , and Gina , all of whom have either appeared or been mentioned in one of the plays ( though only Helen is mentioned in the movie ) .
William 's oldest daughter , Helen , is in her mid to late 30s in Diary of a Mad Black Woman , which makes William in his 50s .
Tyler Perry has confirmed that in A Madea Family Funeral ( 2018 ) Madea has another brother named Heathrow ( also played by Perry ) , a Vietnam war veteran .

ORLANDO JONES 'S APRIL
FOOLS PRANK Section::::Orlando Jones 's April Fools prank .
On April 1 , 2013 , Orlando Jones pulled an April Fools ' Day prank , informing the public via his Huffington Post account that he would be replacing Perry as Madea .
Jones led the public to believe that the decision had come amid Perry 's prior obligations , assisting Oprah Winfrey with her struggling OWN network .
As part of the prank , Jones released a photo of himself to the public in which he was impersonating Madea .
In addition , he incorporated several pretend quotes seemingly issued by Perry , both acknowledging the news and giving Jones his blessing to continue on with the character .
Unaware of the prank , however , many fans responded with great outrage and criticism .
As result of increasing outcries from fans , Perry informed the public on April 15 , 2013 , that the news was untrue .
Perry was quoted as stating , " That was an April Fool 's joke that HE did .
Not true .
And not funny .
When I 'm done with Madea , she is done . "
CRITICISM Section::::Criticism .
Perry has been accused of minstrelsy and playing into black stereotypes with the Madea character , most notably by fellow black director Spike Lee .
Perry 's argument with Lee dates back to a 2009 interview in which Lee referred to Perry 's films as " coonery buffoonery " .
Lee equated the Madea movies with the old - time minstrel shows which lampooned black people as dim - witted , lazy , buffoonish , superstitious and happy - go - lucky , and further stated that if a white director made a movie depicting black people in such a manner he would be ostracized .
Perry responded by stating that his films were meant as entertainment and should not be taken so seriously .
Stated Perry , " I am sick of him talking about me .
I am sick of him saying , ' This is a coon , this is a buffoon . '
I am sick of him talking about black people going to see movies .
This is what he said : ' You vote by what you see'—as if black people do n't know what they want to see .
I am sick of him .
He talked about Whoopi , he talked about Oprah , he talked about me , he talked about Clint Eastwood .
Spike needs to shut the hell up ! "
