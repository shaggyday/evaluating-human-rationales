RELATIONSHIPS
Section::::Relationships .
Stefan has a love - hate relationship with his brother , Damon Salvatore ( Ian Somerhalder ) .
Wesley " adores " Somerhalder , who he said he has " natural chemistry " with .
Wesley stated : " The dynamic of the characters is so interesting because they love each other , but they hate each other [ ... ]
There 's always this thing in Stefan 's head where he hopes that one day Damon can just be as normal and functioning as possible " .
However , he also described their relationship as " beautiful " in their flashbacks from the past , because they " loved each other so much back then " .
Stefan begins a romance with Elena on the show 's first episode , without telling her he was a vampire .
She was later shocked to find out that he was a vampire , and briefly ended their relationship before getting back together .
As the show progressed , Elena began developing feelings for Damon as well .
Wesley described Damon and Stefan as having a " silent understanding of the fact that they both are in love with the same girl " , and " that was Stefan 's girl , and now Damon is suddenly a real factor
, he 's really in the picture " .
Wesley 's favorite episode of The Vampire Diaries is " The Turning Point " because it was " really beautiful " for Stefan and Elena as a couple .
In the episode , Stefan turns around " because he 's ashamed of his face " with blood rushing through his eyes and his veins popping out .
Wesley said " he 's terrified , and he hates himself for it .
He runs from that part of himself , but she turns him around and tells him not to be afraid .
She touches his face , and she thinks he 's beautiful .
It 's so intimate , that moment , because she accepts the darkest part of him . "
When the original vampire Klaus Mikaelson ( Joseph Morgan ) is feared dead , it is revealed that everyone in his bloodline will die , including Stefan and Damon .
In what International Business Times called " the moment Vampire Diaries fans have been waiting for " , Elena had to pick to say goodbye to Stefan or Damon .
She ended up choosing Stefan .
When Elena became a vampire , her feelings for Damon heightened , and it was later revealed that she had a sired bond to him .
Elena and Stefan broke up , and she began a romance with Damon .
Stefan became heartbroken , feeling angry and betrayed , and lashed out at Damon and Elena .
Wesley urged fans of Stefan and Elena not to lose hope , stating : " The fans should definitely maintain some hope .
The thing to remember is that Stefan and Elena have this love that is so strong , and it was sort of the core of Season 1 â€” you ca n't entirely disregard that " .
The show 's head writer , Julie Plec , said " They love each other as deeply as two people can love each other , but that does n't mean that their relationship is infallible " .
BLOOD ADDICTION Section::::Blood addiction .
In 1864 , Stefan " had n't yet learned the careful control that rules his life now " and was an avid consumer of human blood , which was considered a " dark past " by Zap2it .
Of his blood addiction , Wesley said : " It 's awesome .
It 's a drug .
He 's a drug addict .
I get to play a drug addict , which I love .
I 'm going back to his days of usage , heavy usage .
When I 'm in my lustful state , it 's so much fun .
I felt like I got to play a role that I 'd never played before .
I felt like I was doing something different .
I just love it , and I hope it comes out the way that I envisioned .
" The show 's executive producer Kevin Williamson revealed that he was " looking forward to Stefan eventually falling off the wagon and drinking human blood again " after spending decades of consuming only animal blood .
Wesley said " everybody has a dark side , especially a vampire , and it 'd be unrealistic not to explore that " .
Stefan became addicted to human blood again , but got it under control with the help of Elena , who began letting him feed off her in small amounts to build up discipline .
However , in the show 's third season , Stefan 's addiction returned .
His humanity was taken away by Klaus , and the audience met " The Ripper " , his " bloodthirsty , ruthless alter - ego who had previously only been legend " according to Zap2it , who found " this sociopath version of our hero far more compelling than his usual compassionate martyr self " .
Wesley , who enjoyed " Ripper Stefan " more , said it " bums me out " when Stefan quit human blood again .
He said " Good Stefan does n't feel as natural in terms of what I want to be doing on screen , and what I want to be saying .
I feel a little stifled , myself , whenever he 's resisting the urge to do vampiresque things . "
