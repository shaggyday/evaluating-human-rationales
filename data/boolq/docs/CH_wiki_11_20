CRIMINAL JURISDICTION Criminal jurisdiction is a term used in constitutional law and public law to describe the power of courts to hear a case brought by a state accusing a defendant of the commission of a crime .
It is relevant in three distinct situations : * to regulate the relationship between states , or between one state and another ; * * where the nation is a federation , to regulate the relationship between the federal courts and the domestic courts of those states comprising the federation ; and * * where a state only has , to a greater or lesser extent , a single and unified system of law , it is the law of criminal procedure to regulate what cases each classification of court within the judicial system shall adjudicate upon .
People must be tried in the same state the crime is committed .
* EXTRATERRITORIAL ISSUES SUPRANATIONAL COURTS Section::::Extraterritorial issues .
Section::::Supranational courts .
Under the public international law system , de jure states are sovereign within their own territorial boundaries .
A few states such as the Netherlands have adopted a monist approach , i.e. they accept international and municipal laws as part of a single system .
Thus , whether a supranational court or tribunal has criminal jurisdiction over its territory or citizens , will be determined by international law .
The majority of states are dualist , i.e. they will only accept international obligations through the process of incorporation , say by signing and adopting treaties and conventions .
Hence , whether a supranational court or tribunal will have jurisdiction and , if so , over what subject matter and over what period of time , will be decided by the sovereign government of the day .
EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION IN INTERNATIONAL LAW Section::::Extraterritorial jurisdiction in international law .
Because each government is supreme , it can enact whatever statutes it wishes .
Thus , State A would have the power to make a law which , for example , made it an offence to smoke in the streets of State B , a neighbouring state .
State A could employ officers and equip them with cameras .
These officers could then collect evidence in State B and , when its citizens returned home , State A could prosecute them for breach of the law .
But State A 's law could not be directly effective in State B because that would make State B less than sovereign .
Similarly , State A could not seek the extradition of its own citizens from State B unless State B was formally to consent ( usually through the negotiation of a treaty including the particular offence ) .
INTERNATIONAL CRIME Section::::International crime .
Transborder crimes take place in more than one state .
For example , a defendant may fire a gun , post a package , or write or speak words in State A , but the effects of each action are felt in State B.
Some states claim a public policy justification to exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed by , or crimes committed against their citizens , even though these crimes are committed outside their borders .
Thus , one of the classifications of crime is " crimes against the state " .
These are crimes that affect the interests of the state or its administration .
In extreme cases , a state may wish to prosecute one of its own citizens for treason even though all the relevant acts and omissions took place in another state .
Similarly , if a citizen of State A is acting in a way that interferes with the friendly relations between State A and State B , it may be expedient to prosecute this citizen no matter where the relevant acts have been committed .
Jurisdiction may also be claimed over crimes on board the ships and aircraft operated by corporations based in the given state , no matter where these craft may be located at the relevant time .
In English law , where murder and manslaughter are concerned , the English court has jurisdiction over offences committed abroad , if it was committed by a British citizen ( see section 9 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 and section 3 of the British Nationality Act 1948 ) .
In R v Cheong ( 2006 ) AER ( D ) 385
the appellant was living in Guyana in 1983 .
He shot and killed a man who had just robbed his wife and sister - in - law .
Under local law he was charged only with the unlicensed possession of a firearm ; but as a British citizen , section 9 of the 1861 Act applied 19 years after he returned to England and he was charged with murder .
On appeal , a conviction for manslaughter was upheld .
At a level of conventional policy , there are two main theories to justify the exercise of jurisdiction : THE INITIATORY OR SUBJECTIVE
THEORY Section::::The initiatory or subjective theory .
The state in which the sequence of events begins , claims jurisdiction because the accused did everything in his or her power to commit the offence within its territory .
Intending to deceive Y into parting with money , X writes a begging letter claiming to be a penniless widow with ten starving children and posts it in State
A. X must then rely on the postal workers to carry the letter to Y in State B.
No matter how hard X tries , X can not take any further action to promote the scheme , and whether it succeeds or fails is entirely outside his or her ability to control .
There are three theoretical issues to consider : *
the definition of the actus reus elements of the crime must be wide enough to include a continuing sequence of events .
Some offences are either frozen in time or geography because they are defined either as activities being undertaken when the harm occurs ( e.g. driving offences ) , or in terms of their consequences .
For example , the definition of a " deception " is some form of dishonest representation that induces the victim to do or refrain from doing something that causes him or her loss .
Anything else is preparatory or anticipatory to this key intellectual event .
Thus , to facilitate a prosecution of X , the definition of the offence in State A must include writing and posting the letter in State A as well as the operation of the letter upon the mind of the recipient in the State
B.
* State A would be prosecuting conduct occurring within its borders that does not constitute the complete actus reus , i.e. unless and until the letter is read by the recipient , the deception can not operate or fail .
The alternative would be to consider X 's actions of writing and posting the letter as preparatory acts and so an attempt .
This would be sensible if the letter fails to convince Y , but a nonsense if the letter actually induces Y into sending a cheque back to X. * the policy that caused State A to criminalise the given actus reus must justify a prosecution even though no actual injury or damage has been sustained to a person resident within the territory of State A.
The usual justification for criminalising any set of acts or omissions is as a deterrent to protect local citizens .
It is not usually the policy of State A to protect the citizens of State B from harm : that duty arises out of the social contract between State B and its own citizens .
In English law , see the definition of a deception which must be the operative cause of the " obtaining " in the deception offences and under the Theft Act 1978 , and note that all the inchoate offencess move in time and across borders so that an attempt continues from the proximate act until failure , a conspiracy agreement is not limited to a particular place , and the encouragement by a secondary party as an accessory continues until the principal commits the substantive offence .
THE TERMINATORY OR
OBJECTIVE THEORY Section::::The terminatory or objective theory .
If the injury or damage affects a citizen within the territory of a state , it would be usual for that state to claim jurisdiction to protect the interests of those who are present within its borders .
But X would not have taken any action within State B 's borders , so the wording of the actus reus must permit a prosecution in this situation .
The theoretical justification for this jurisdiction may be that X has intended to cause the loss or injury and so should not escape liability through the device of only seeking to deceive those resident outside State A ( a strategy that would be very simple given the internet ) .
The justification is less clear when the place of injury is an accident .
Within a single state , the doctrine of transferred intent would apply to criminalise accidental departures from a planned attack , but if X 's letter is redirected out of State A by one of Y 's helpful relatives , the receipt of the letter by Y on holiday in State B is entirely outside X 's actual intention ( just it might be irrelevant to a sender where the recipient of an e - mail is resident ) .
Alternatively , suppose that X physically attacks Y in State A , intending to kill him .
Both are nationals of State A. Y is seriously injured and , because the hospitals in State B have a superior track record for treating injuries of this type , Y arranges to be transferred to State B where he later dies .
Again , there is no causal connection between X 's initial criminal acts and the territory of State B , and seeking to found jurisdiction simply on the ground that Y died within its borders , is not wholly convincing given that Y is not a national of State B and
so neither owes allegiance nor is owed any duty of protection as a part of State B 's social contract .
IN THE UNITED STATES Section::::In the United States .
The United States is a federation of states .
The U.S. Constitution creates a federal government and legislature which has general powers over the territory of the whole and over foreign policy , whereas the individual states have their own governments that , within the scope allowed by the federal constitution , have local territorial jurisdiction .
There is a system of federal courts which have jurisdiction to hear charges alleging federal crimes , and state courts have jurisdiction to hear charges alleging violations of local state law .
U.S. FEDERAL COURTS Section::::U.S. federal courts .
Under the U.S. Constitution , the power of Congress to enact criminal statutes is limited ; the federal government lacks " plenary criminal jurisdiction .
" The powers of Congress to enact criminal laws " are not boundless .
"
The U.S. Constitution mentions explicit authority for Congress in three areas : ( 1 ) counterfeiting , ( 2 ) piracy and felony on the high seas and offenses against the law of nations , and ( 3 ) treason .
However , the " necessary and proper " clause of the Constitution gives Congress " broad power to enact laws that are ' convenient or useful ' or ' conductive ' to the authority 's ' beneficial exercise ' " .
The United States district courts have original , exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over " all offenses against the laws of the United States . "
Some crimes are related to areas owned by or under the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government .
Examples of these crimes include those committed in the District of Columbia , in U.S. Territories , in U.S. National Parks , in federal courthouses and federal prisons , and aboard airplanes ( regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration ) and ocean - going vessels .
The United States military has its own criminal justice system applicable to its members , and civilians may be charged with a federal crime for acts committed on military bases .
Federal courts also have jurisdiction to hear cases brought against U.S. citizens based on their illegal activities in other countries .
The Sixth Amendment calls for trial " by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed . "
Within the federal court system , Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure specifies which federal court may hear a particular criminal case : Anderson , 328 U.S. , at 703 holds : " [ T]he locus delicti must be determined from the nature of the crime alleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it . "
In Hyde v. United States , 225 U.S. 347 ( 1912 ) although none of the defendants had entered the District of Columbia as part of their conspiracy to defraud the United States , they were convicted because one co - conspirator had committed overt acts in Columbia ( 225 U.S. , at 363 ) .
So conspiracy is a continuing offense committed in all the districts where a co - conspirator acts on the agreement .
Similarly , In re Palliser , 136 U.S. 257 ( 1890 ) the sending of letters from New York to postmasters in Connecticut in an attempt to gain postage on credit , made Connecticut , where the mail he addressed and dispatched was received , an appropriate venue ( 136 U.S. , at 266—268 ) .
See 18 U.S.C. § 3237(a ) :
This was applied in United States v. Johnson , 323 U.S. 273 , 275 ( 1944 ) so that " an illegal use of the mails … may subject the user to prosecution in the district where he sent the goods , or in the district of their arrival , or in any intervening district . "
PROBLEMS Section::::Problems .
This system works well when there is a clear line of demarcation between the two state jurisdictions , or between a state and federal jurisdictions , and prosecutions may be initiated in the appropriate court .
But laws and rules are not always so clear .
CONCURRENT JURISDICTION
Section::::Concurrent jurisdiction .
Some crimes have national significance and , to reflect the public interest , their investigation and prosecution will fall to the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Department of Justice .
This creates tensions between the two systems because the individual states in which aspects of the criminal activity have taken place may wish to assert jurisdiction over that part , whereas the federal authorities will wish to consolidate the wrongdoing across several states into a single trial .
One significant result of the concurrent jurisdiction between state and federal courts ( and in some cases between different state courts ) is that an individual who violates both state and federal law , or the laws of multiple states , can be separately charged and tried in each jurisdiction .
Thus , a resident of Virginia who defrauds a Florida resident through the mail may be tried in Virginia state court and in a Florida state court , and in a federal court in either Florida or Virginia .
A famous example of dual state and federal sovereignty is the Rodney King case .
Police officers who beat motorist Rodney King were acquitted of assault charges in the California state court , but were convicted of violating King 's civil rights - based on the same events - in a federal court in California .
