THE LION SLEEPS TONIGHT
" The Lion Sleeps Tonight " is a song originally recorded by Solomon Linda under the title " Mbube " for the South African Gallo Record Company in 1939 .
Linda 's version was written in Zulu , while the English lyrics were written by George David Weiss .
The song was adapted and covered internationally by many pop and folk revival artists in the 1950s and 1960s , including the Weavers , Jimmy Dorsey , Yma Sumac , Miriam Makeba , and the Kingston Trio .
In 1961 , it became a number one hit in the United States as adapted in English with the best - known version by the doo - wop group the Tokens .
It went on to earn millions in royalties from cover versions and film licensing .
The pop group Tight Fit had a number one hit in the UK with the song in 1982 .
HISTORY Section::::History .
" Mbube " ( Zulu for " lion " ) was written in the 1920s by Solomon Linda , a South African singer of Zulu origin , who later worked for the Gallo Record Company in Johannesburg as a cleaner and record packer .
He spent his weekends performing with the Evening Birds , a musical ensemble , and it was at Gallo Records , under the direction of producer Griffiths Motsieloa , that Linda and his fellow musicians recorded several songs , including " Mbube " , which incorporated a call - response pattern common among many Sub - Saharan African ethnic groups , including the Zulu .
According to journalist Rian Malan:"Mbube " was n't the most remarkable tune , but there was something compelling about the underlying chant , a dense meshing of low male voices above which Solomon yodelled and howled for two exhilarating minutes , improvising occasionally .
The third take was the best , achieving immortality when Solly took a deep breath , opened his mouth , and improvised the melody that the world now associates with these words : Issued by Gallo as a 78-rpm phonograph record in 1939 , and marketed to black audiences , " Mbube " became a hit and Linda a star throughout South Africa .
By 1948 , the song had sold over 100,000 copies in Africa and among black South African immigrants in Great Britain .
Linda also lent its name to a style of African a cappella music that evolved into isicathamiya ( also called mbube ) , popularized by Ladysmith Black Mambazo .
In 1949 , Alan Lomax , then working as folk music director for Decca Records , brought Solomon Linda 's 78 recording to the attention of his friend Pete Seeger of the folk group The Weavers .
In November 1951 , after having performed the song for at least a year in their concerts , The Weavers recorded an adapted version with brass and string orchestra and chorus and released it as a 78 single titled " Wimoweh " , a mishearing of the original song 's chorus of " Uyimbube " , .
Their version contained the chanting chorus " Wimoweh " and Linda 's improvised melodic line .
The Weavers credited the song as " Traditional " , with arrangement by " Paul Campbell " , later found to be a pseudonym used by the Weavers in order to claim royalties .
It reached Billboard 's top ten and became a staple of The Weavers ' live repertoire , achieving further exposure on their best - selling The Weavers at Carnegie Hall LP album , recorded in 1955 and issued in 1957 .
The song was also covered extensively by other folk revival groups such as The Kingston Trio , and exotica singer Yma Sumac .
However , Miriam Makeba , in 1960 , recorded the same song as " Mbube " , with the writing credit given to " J. Linda " .
In 1961 , two RCA Records producers , Hugo Peretti and Luigi Creatore , hired Juilliard - trained musician and lyricist George David Weiss to arrange a pop music cover of " Wimoweh " for the B - side of a 45-rpm single called " Tina " , sung by the teenage doo - wop group The Tokens .
Weiss wrote the English lyrics : " In the jungle , the mighty jungle , The lion sleeps tonight ... " and " Hush , my darling , do n't fear , my darling ... "
Weiss also brought in soprano Anita Darian to reprise Yma Sumac 's version , before , during and after the soprano saxophone solo .
"
The Lion Sleeps Tonight " was issued by RCA in 1961 , and it rocketed to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 .
Weiss ' Abilene Music Inc. , was the publisher of this arrangement , and listed " Albert Stanton " ( a pseudonym for Al Brackman , the business partner of Pete Seeger 's music publisher , Howie Richmond ) as one of the song 's writers or arrangers .
COPYRIGHT ISSUES Section::::Copyright issues .
Social historian Ronald D. Cohen writes , " Howie Richmond copyrighted many songs originally in the public domain [ sic ] but now slightly revised to satisfy Decca and also to reap profits . "
Canadian writer Mark Steyn , on the other hand , attributes the invention of the pseudonym " Paul Campbell " to Pete Seeger .
Howie Richmond 's claim of author 's copyright could secure both the songwriter 's royalties and his company 's publishing share of the song 's earnings .
Although Linda was listed as a performer on the record itself , the Weavers thought he had recorded a traditional Zulu song .
Their managers , publisher , and their attorneys knew otherwise because they had been contacted by — and had reached an agreement with — Eric Gallo of Gallo Records in South Africa .
The Americans maintained , however , that South African copyrights were not valid because South Africa was not a signatory to U.S. copyright law .
In the 1950s , after Linda 's authorship was made clear , Seeger sent Linda $ 1000 .
Seeger also instructed TRO / Folkways to henceforth pay his share of authors ' earnings to Linda .
The folksinger apparently trusted his publisher 's word of honor and either saw no need , or was unable to make sure these instructions were carried out .
In 2000 , South African journalist Rian Malan wrote a feature article for Rolling Stone magazine in which he recounted Linda 's story and estimated that the song had earned $ 15 million for its use in the Disney movie The Lion King alone .
The piece prompted filmmaker François Verster to create the Emmy - winning documentary A Lion 's Trail , that told Linda 's story while incidentally exposing the workings of the multi - million dollar corporate music publishing industry .
In July 2004 , as a result of the publicity generated by Malan 's article and the subsequent documentary , the song became the subject of a lawsuit between Linda 's estate and Disney , claiming that Disney owed $ 1.6 million in royalties for the use of " The Lion Sleeps Tonight " in the film and musical stage productions of The Lion King .
At the same time , the Richmond Organization began to pay $ 3,000 annually into Linda 's estate .
In February 2006 , Linda 's descendants reached a legal settlement with Abilene Music Publishers , who held the worldwide rights and had licensed the song to Disney , to place the earnings of the song in a trust .
In 2012 , Mbue fell into the public domain due to Copyright law of South Africa .
