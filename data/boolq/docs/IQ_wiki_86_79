PRODUCTION
CREW
Section::::Production .
Section::::Crew .
The writing staff for the sixth season includes executive producers and showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss , producer Bryan Cogman and Dave Hill .
Author George R. R. Martin , who had written one episode for each of the first four seasons , did not write an episode for the sixth season , as he was working to finish writing the sixth A Song of Ice and Fire novel , The Winds of Winter .
The directing staff for the sixth season was Jeremy Podeswa ( episodes 1 and 2 ) , Daniel Sackheim ( episodes 3 and 4 ) , Jack Bender ( episodes 5 and 6 ) , Mark Mylod ( episodes 7 and 8) , and Miguel Sapochnik ( episodes 9 and 10 ) .
Sackheim and Bender were first - time Game of Thrones directors , with the rest each having directed two episodes in the previous season .
WRITING Section::::Writing .
With the end of the fifth season , the content of the show has reached the plot of the latest novel in Martin 's A Song of Ice and Fire series , A Dance with Dragons .
Season 6 director Jeremy Podeswa said in August 2015 :
" Right now in season six , what we 're shooting currently is n't based on anything in the book .
It 's fully based on discussions the writers have had with George Martin , because the series has now surpassed the books in terms of what 's available . "
Actress Natalie Dormer , who plays Margaery Tyrell , later added that the show 's writers " know where it 's got to go and what [ George Martin ] 's intentions for the characters are .
But they are just filling in the gaps . "
The season premiere starts off right where the fifth season ended .
A plot from The Winds of Winter regarding a traveling theater troupe located in Braavos that stages a play called " The Bloody Hand " , about the events that have taken place in King 's Landing since the beginning of the series , is included in the sixth season .
FILMING
Section::::Filming .
Filming for season six began in July 2015 , and ended on December 17 , 2015 .
The budget for the sixth season increased compared to the previous seasons as each episode did cost over $ 10 million per episode , totaling over $ 100 million for the full season and setting a new high for the series .
The season filmed in five different countries , Northern Ireland , Spain , Croatia , Iceland and Canada .
Like the previous seasons , a large amount of production took place in Northern Ireland , mainly in Belfast and on the Causeway Coast , including film locations in the Binevenagh , Magilligan area which was used to film scenes for the Dothraki Grasslands , and Larrybane Quarry and Ballintoy Harbour , both used for scenes in the Iron Islands .
The small village of Corbet was also used , for the siege of Riverrun .

In August 2015 , HBO announced that for the first time since season 1 , the show would not be filming any scenes in Croatia .
The Croatian city of Dubrovnik has stood in for King 's Landing since the beginning of season 2 ; nearby cities such as Klis , Split and Šibenik have been used to depict various other locations .
Contradicting the statement by HBO , cast of the show were seen in costume in Dubrovnik in October 2015 .
Only a very small portion of the season was filmed in Canada ( north of Calgary , Alberta ) : the scenes featuring Jon Snow 's wolf Ghost ( played by animal actor Quigly ) .
