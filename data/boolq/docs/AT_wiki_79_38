RUN BATTED IN
A run batted in ( RBI ) , plural runs batted in ( RBI or RBIs ) , is a statistic in baseball and softball that credits a batter for making a play that allows a run to be scored ( except in certain situations such as when an error is made on the play ) .
For example , if the batter bats a base hit , then another player on a higher base can head home to score a run , and the batter gets credited with batting in that run .
Before the 1920 Major League Baseball season , runs batted in were not an official baseball statistic .
Nevertheless , the RBI statistic was tabulated — unofficially — from 1907 through 1919 by baseball writer Ernie Lanigan , according to the Society for American Baseball Research .
Common nicknames for an RBI include " ribby " ( or " ribbie " ) , " rib " , and " ribeye " .
The plural of RBI is generally " RBIs " , although some commentators use " RBI " as both singular and plural , as it can also stand for " runs batted in " .

The 2018 edition of the Official Baseball Rules of Major League Baseball , Rule 9.04 Runs Batted In , reads CRITICISM Section::::Criticism .
The perceived significance of the RBI is displayed by the fact that it is one of the three categories that compose the triple crown .
In addition , career RBIs are often cited in debates over who should be elected to the Hall of Fame .
However , critics , particularly within the field of sabermetrics , argue that RBIs measure the quality of the lineup more than it does the player himself since an RBI can only be credited to a player if one or more batters preceding him in the batting order reached base ( the exception to this being a home run , in which the batter is credited with driving himself in , not just those already on base ) .
This implies that better offensive teams — and therefore , the teams in which the most players get on base — tend to produce hitters with higher RBI totals than equivalent hitters on lesser - hitting teams .
