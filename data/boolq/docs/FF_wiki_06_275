MACBOOK AIR
The MacBook Air is a line of Macintosh subnotebook computers developed and manufactured by
Apple Inc. It consists of a full - size keyboard , a machined aluminum case , and a thin light structure .
The Air is available with a screen size of ( measured diagonally ) 13.3-inch ( 33.782 cm ) , with different specifications produced by Apple .
Since 2010 , all MacBook Air models have used solid - state drive storage and Intel Core i5 or i7 CPUs .
A MacBook Air with an 11.6-inch ( 29.46 cm ) screen was made available in 2010 .
In the current product line , the MacBook Air sits below the performance - range of the MacBook Pro and compared to the MacBook .
However , its features reflect different priorities .
The Air was originally released as a premium ultraportable positioned above the previous MacBook .
Since then , the Air has become Apple 's entry - level laptop due to the MacBook 's discontinuation in 2011 , as well as lowered prices on subsequent iterations .
FIRST GENERATION Section::::First generation .
Steve Jobs introduced the first MacBook Air during a speech at his keynote at the 2008 Macworld conference held on January 15 , 2008 .
The first - generation MacBook Air was a 13.3"-only model , initially promoted as the world 's thinnest notebook ( 1.94 cm MacBook may be compared with 1.98 cm for a previous record model , 2005 's Toshiba Portege R200 ) .
It featured a custom Intel Merom CPU and Intel GMA graphics .
In late 2008 , the CPU was updated to a faster , non - custom Penryn CPU and integrated Nvidia GeForce graphics while the hard drive capacity was increased and the micro - DVI video port was replaced by the Mini DisplayPort .
A mid-2009 refresh , introduced alongside the MacBook Pro family , featured a slightly higher - capacity battery , and a faster Penryn CPU .
DESIGN Section::::Design .
The MacBook Air features an anti - glare LED backlit display and a full - size keyboard , as well as a large trackpad that responds to multi - touch gestures such as pinching , swiping , and rotating .
Since the release of Snow Leopard , the Air 's trackpad has supported handwriting recognition of Chinese characters .
The MacBook Air was the first subcompact laptop offered by Apple since the full - featured 12 " PowerBook G4 was discontinued in 2006 .
It was also Apple 's first computer with an optional solid - state drive .
ArsTechnica found " moderate " performance improvements of the 64 GB solid - state drive of the first - generation Air over the standard 80 GB hard drive in tests .
On October 14 , 2008 , new models were announced with improved capacities of 128 GB SSD and 120 GB hard drive .
The CPU was a custom Intel Core 2 Duo Merom that was 40 % of the size of the standard chip package .
For models of late 2008 , the CPU was replaced with a low - voltage Penryn chip with 6 MB of cache , running on a 1066 MHz bus .
RECEPTION Section::::Reception .
Following its introduction , the MacBook Air was greeted with a mixed reception .
The portability of the MacBook Air was praised in reviews , but the compromise in features was criticized .
The full - sized keyboard , weight , thinness , and Multi - Touch trackpad were appreciated in reviews , while the limited configuration options and ports , slow speed ( in non - SSD models ) , non - user - replaceable battery , small hard drive , and price were criticized .
The flip - down hatch on the side of the original MacBook Air is a tight fit for some headphone plugs and USB devices , requiring users to purchase an extension cable .
Apple removed the flip - down hatch on the late 2010 model in favor of open connection ports , as is the case with most other laptops .
Some users have complained of CPU lockup caused by overheating .
Apple released a software update in early March 2008 to fix the problem with mixed results : the deactivation of one CPU core was corrected ; however , the runaway kernel problem remained for some users .
The problem is aggravated by system - intensive tasks such as video playback or video chatting .
" THINNEST LAPTOP " Section::::"Thinnest laptop " .
At the launch of the MacBook Air in January 2008 , Apple claimed it to be the thinnest laptop in the world .
While this was true of laptops on sale at the time , the 2003 Sharp Actius MM10 Muramasas was thinner at some points than the Macbook Air , being thick at its minimum .
It , like the MacBook Air , was a tapered design , with a maximum height of — slightly thicker than the MacBook Air — shown above as .
The Sony Vaio X505 , released in 2004 , had a minimum thickness of and a maximum of .
Since the release of the MacBook Air , other thinner laptops have been released , such as the Dell Adamo , launched in March 2009 , which is a constant thick .
Apple subsequently removed " The world 's thinnest notebook " from their marketing materials .

Dimensions SECOND GENERATION ( TAPERED PROFILE )
Section::::Second generation ( Tapered profile ) .
On October 20 , 2010 , Apple released a redesigned 13.3 " model with a tapered enclosure , higher screen resolution , improved battery , and flash storage instead of a hard drive .
In addition , a new 11.6 " model was introduced , offering reduced cost , weight , battery life , and performance relative to the 13.3 " model , but better performance than typical netbooks of the time .
On July 20 , 2011 , Apple released updates to the 11.6 " and 13.3 " models of the MacBook Air , which also became Apple 's entry - level laptops due to lowered prices and the discontinuation of the white MacBook around the same time .
The mid-2011 MacBook Airs were powered by the new Sandy Bridge 1.6 or 1.7 GHz dual - core Intel Core i5 , or 1.8 GHz dual - core Intel Core i7 processors , that came with an Intel HD Graphics 3000 processor , and with a backlit keyboard , two USB 2.0 ports , FaceTime camera , a standard of 2 GB of RAM ( configurable up to 4 GB ) , Thunderbolt which shares function with Mini DisplayPort and Bluetooth was upgraded to v4.0 .
Maximum SSD flash memory storage options were increased up to 256 GB .
Both 11 " and 13 " models had an analog audio output / headphone minijack ( that also supports an iPhone / iPod touch headset with microphone ) , but only the 13 " model had an integrated SDXC - capable SD Card slot .
These models use a less expensive " Eagle Ridge " Thunderbolt controller that provides two Thunderbolt channels ( 2 × 10 Gbit / s bidirectional ) , compared to the MacBook Pro which uses a " Light Ridge " controller that provides four Thunderbolt channels ( 4 × 10 Gbit / s bidirectional ) .
A USB ethernet adapter was immediately available upon release and a Thunderbolt - to - Firewire 800 adapter became available in mid - year 2012 .
On June 11 , 2012 , Apple released an updated model in the same form factor as the prior model .
The new model is powered by the new Ivy Bridge dual - core Intel Core i5 and i7 processors , doubles the RAM and SSD speeds , has the new USB 3 ports ( with USB 2 capability ) in place of the USB 2 ports and the new MagSafe 2 charging port .
The camera was upgraded to 720p FaceTime HD .
On June 10 , 2013 , Apple released another update in the same form factor as the 2012 model during the company 's Worldwide Developer Conference ( WWDC ) .
The 11 " and 13 " models have a minimum standard 4 GB RAM , with a maximum configuration of 8 GB .
Both models are powered by the Haswell ULT 1.3 GHz dual - core Intel Core i5 processors , with Turbo Boost up to 2.6 GHz , while a 1.7 GHz Dual - Core i7 , with Turbo Boost up to 3.3 GHz , option is also available .
Each model 's storage standard is 128 GB SSD , upgradeable to 256 GB and 512 GB SSD .
Due to Haswell CPUs , battery life has considerably improved from the previous generation , and the mid-2013 models are capable of 9 hours on the 11 " model and 12 hours on the 13 " model ; a team of reviewers exceeded expected battery life ratings during their test .
DESIGN Section::::Design .
MacBook Air components are officially non - user - replaceable , though third - parties do sell upgrade kits for the SSDs .
The flash memory and battery are enclosed within the casing , with RAM soldered onto the motherboard .
The flash memory , difficult to access , has a 128 MB cache and a mSATA connection ( updated to a proprietary PCIe interface ) to the motherboard .
On the 11 " Air , the left side of the computer has a MagSafe power connector , a USB port , a headphone jack , and a microphone .
The right side of the computer has a USB port and a Mini DisplayPort , now sharing Thunderbolt function beginning with the 2011 model .
On top of the screen bezel there is a webcam , first dubbed iSight and now the FaceTime camera .
Apple incorporated several features in the design of the MacBook Air , such as the reduction of lead to make it more environmentally friendly .
The MacBook Air contains no BFRs and PVC wiring , meets Energy Star 5.0 requirements , has a recyclable enclosure , and is rated EPEAT Gold .
Its display is made from arsenic - free glass , and contains no mercury .
To reduce the computer 's size and weight , several features were sacrificed .
It was Apple 's first notebook since the PowerBook 2400c without a built - in removable media drive .
It also omits a FireWire port , Ethernet port , line - in , media card slots ( except the 13 " 2010 through 2015 models , which have an SD card slot ) , and a Kensington Security Slot .
To gain optical drive features , users could either purchase an external USB SuperDrive or other brand , or the bundled Remote Disc software , only for browsing or software installation to access the drive of another computer wirelessly that has the program installed .
It can also be used to reinstall the system software from the included installation DVD .
Remote Disc supports NetBooting , so the Air can boot from its installation DVD in another computer 's drive , which requires Remote Install Mac OS X to be running on that computer .
The software does not allow playback or information of DVDs , CDs or installing Windows .
For these features , an external USB drive is required .
More recent versions of OS X replaced the installation DVD with a USB flash drive containing the software , eliminating remote installation .
The 2010 models include two speakers for stereo sound while earlier versions have one speaker located under the keyboard .
The 2011 model replaces DisplayPort with a Thunderbolt 1 port , and also has a 1280×720 FaceTime HD Camera , replacing the previous 640×480 iSight camera .
The 2012 model replaces USB 2 with USB 3 , and uses the MagSafe 2 instead of the MagSafe connector for charging .
The 2015 model updated the Thunderbolt port to Thunderbolt 2 .
ISSUES Section::::Issues .
Due to a more mature manufacturing process , the CPUs in the second - generation MacBook Air perform better under load , as the first generation chips ran at a higher temperature — the processor needed to be throttled to avoid overheating and this further degraded performance .
On October 17 , 2013 , Apple announced a replacement program for the 64 GB and 128 GB MacBook Air flash storage drives that are installed in Air systems purchased between June 2012 and June 2013 .
RECEPTION COMPARISON WITH IPAD AND NETBOOKS Section::::Reception .
Section::::Comparison with iPad and netbooks .
Although the 11 " Air is only slightly lighter than the 13 " Air , the biggest difference is the footprint which gives each model a distinct category ; the 13 " Air is much closer in size to most other conventional laptops , while the 11 " Air is almost small enough to fit in a space that can hold an iPad .
The 11 " MacBook Air carried the desirable essential attributes of a netbook , but without the drawbacks of a slower processor and less capable operating system , albeit at a higher price .
At the low end , Apple introduced the iPad — a different form factor than the netbook , but with improved computing capabilities and lower production cost .
Both of these led to a decline in netbook sales , and most PC manufacturers have consequently discontinued their netbook lines in response .
Capitalizing on the success of the MacBook Air , Intel promoted Ultrabook as a new high - mobility standard , which has been hailed by some analysts as succeeding where netbooks failed .
ULTRABOOK COMPETITION Section::::Ultrabook competition .
Intel developed a set of specifications for the Ultrabook , a higher - end type of subnotebook produced by various PC manufacturers and usually running Windows .
Competing directly with the Air , the Ultrabook is intended to reduce size and weight , and extend battery life without compromising performance .
Through July 1 , 2013 , the MacBook Air took in 56 percent of all Ultrabook sales in the United States , despite being one of the higher - priced competitors .
While several Ultrabooks were able to claim individual distinctions such as being the lightest or thinnest , the MacBook Air was regarded by reviewers as the best all - around Ultrabook in regard to " OS X experience , full keyboard , superior trackpad , Thunderbolt connector and the higher - quality , all - aluminum unibody construction " .
The Microsoft Surface Pro has a similar size and price to the 11 " MacBook Air ; Apple CEO Tim Cook has criticized the Surface Pro and other Ultrabook hybrids running the touch - based Windows 8 , that attempt to combine laptop and tablet functionality in one device , saying that such devices were confusing like trying to " combine a fridge and a toaster " .
When released in October 2010 , the 13 " model 's screen resolution was higher than the average 1366x768 screens of similar sized laptops .
However , by mid-2013 , with many premium Ultrabooks having high resolution screens ( 1080p or greater ) as standard or upgrades , the MacBook Air has been increasingly criticized for sticking with a low - resolution screen .
Many in the tech community had expected Apple to release a MacBook Air with Retina Display by mid-2013 , similar to the MacBook Pro Retina which came out in 2012 .
The October 2013 refresh of the 13 " MacBook Pro Retina , with a slimmer chassis and a lower price point , was mentioned as a potential MacBook Air alternative as the battery life is not much shorter while not being considerably bulkier .
Apple released an entry - level version of the 13 " MacBook Pro on October 27 , 2016 , which was specifically targeted towards MacBook Air users .
The 11.6 " MacBook Air , introduced in October 2010 , is only slightly larger and heavier ( when closed ) than the iPad 2 .
The 11.6 " Air has been regarded as thin and light compared to other ultraportables , such as the Sony VAIO Z and the 11 " Samsung Series 9 .
As of 2013 , several Ultrabooks such as the Sony VAIO Pro have managed smaller dimensions than the MacBook Air by using carbon fiber construction .
