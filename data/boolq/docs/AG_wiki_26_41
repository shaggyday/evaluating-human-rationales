NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR ( UNITED STATES )
The Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs ( APNSA ) , commonly referred to as the National Security Advisor ( NSA ) or at times informally termed the NSC Advisor , is a senior aide in the Executive Office of the President , based at the West Wing of the White House , who serves as the chief in - house advisor to the President of the United States on national security issues .
The National Security Advisor is appointed by the President and does not require confirmation by the Senate , but an appointment of a three or four - star general to the role requires Senate reconfirmation of military rank .
The National Security Advisor participates in meetings of the National Security Council ( NSC ) and usually chairs meetings of the Principals Committee of the NSC with the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense ( the meetings not attended by the President ) .
The National Security Advisor is supported by NSC staff who produce research and briefings for the National Security Advisor to review and present , either to the National Security Council or directly to the President .
ROLE Section::::Role .
The influence and role of the National Security Advisor varies from administration to administration and depends not only on the qualities of the person appointed to the position , but also on the style and management philosophy of the incumbent President .
Ideally , the National Security Advisor serves as an honest broker of policy options for the President in the field of national security , rather than as an advocate for his or her own policy agenda .
However , the National Security Advisor is a staff position in the Executive Office of the President and does not have line or budget authority over either the Department of State or the Department of Defense , unlike the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense , who are Senate - confirmed officials with statutory authority over their departments ; but the National Security Advisor is able to offer daily advice ( due to the proximity ) to the President independently of the vested interests of the large bureaucracies and clientele of those departments .
In times of crisis , the National Security Advisor is likely to operate from the White House Situation Room or the Presidential Emergency Operations Center ( as on September 11 , 2001 ) , updating the President on the latest events in a crisis situation .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The National Security Council was created at the start of the Cold War under the National Security Act of 1947 to coordinate defense , foreign affairs , international economic policy , and intelligence ; this was part of a large reorganization that saw the creation of the Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency .
The Act did not create the position of the National Security Advisor per se , but it did create an executive secretary in charge of the staff .
In 1949 , the NSC became part of the Executive Office of the President .
Robert Cutler was the first National Security Advisor in 1953 .
The system has remained largely unchanged since then , particularly since President John Kennedy , with powerful National Security Advisors and strong staff but a lower importance given to formal NSC meetings .
This continuity persists despite the tendency of each new president to replace the advisor and senior NSC staff .
President Richard Nixon 's National Security Advisor , Henry Kissinger , enhanced the importance of the role , controlling the flow of information to the President and meeting him multiple times per day .
Kissinger also holds the distinction of serving as National Security Advisor and Secretary of State at the same time from September 22 , 1973 , until November 3 , 1975 .
