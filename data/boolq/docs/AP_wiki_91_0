GLYCOGEN Glycogen is a multibranched polysaccharide of glucose that serves as a form of energy storage in humans , animals , fungi , and bacteria .
The polysaccharide structure represents the main storage form of glucose in the body .
Glycogen functions as one of two forms of long - term energy reserves , with the other form being triglyceride stores in adipose tissue ( i.e. , body fat ) .
In humans , glycogen is made and stored primarily in the cells of the liver and skeletal muscle .
In the liver , glycogen can make up from 5–6 % of the organ 's fresh weight and the liver of an adult weighing 70 kg can store roughly 100–120 grams of glycogen .
In skeletal muscle , glycogen is found in a low concentration ( 1–2 % of the muscle mass ) and the skeletal muscle of an adult weighing 70 kg stores roughly 400 grams of glycogen .
The amount of glycogen stored in the body — particularly within the muscles and liver — mostly depends on physical training , basal metabolic rate , and eating habits .
Small amounts of glycogen are also found in other tissues and cells , including the kidneys , red blood cells , white blood cells , and glial cells in the brain .
The uterus also stores glycogen during pregnancy to nourish the embryo .
Approximately 4 grams of glucose are present in the blood of humans at all times ; in fasted individuals , blood glucose is maintained constant at this level at the expense of glycogen stores in the liver and skeletal muscle .
Glycogen stores in skeletal muscle serve as a form of energy storage for the muscle itself ; however , the breakdown of muscle glycogen impedes muscle glucose uptake , thereby increasing the amount of blood glucose available for use in other tissues .
Liver glycogen stores serve as a store of glucose for use throughout the body , particularly the central nervous system .
The human brain consumes approximately 60 % of blood glucose in fasted , sedentary individuals .
Glycogen is the analogue of starch , a glucose polymer that functions as energy storage in plants .
It has a structure similar to amylopectin ( a component of starch ) , but is more extensively branched and compact than starch .
Both are white powders in their dry state .
Glycogen is found in the form of granules in the cytosol / cytoplasm in many cell types , and plays an important role in the glucose cycle .
Glycogen forms an energy reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a sudden need for glucose , but one that is less compact than the energy reserves of triglycerides ( lipids ) .
As such it is also found as storage reserve in many parasitic protozoa .
STRUCTURE
Section::::Structure .
Glycogen is a branched biopolymer consisting of linear chains of glucose residues with an average chain length of approximately 8–12 glucose units .
Glucose units are linked together linearly by α(1→4 ) glycosidic bonds from one glucose to the next .
Branches are linked to the chains from which they are branching off by α(1→6 ) glycosidic bonds between the first glucose of the new branch and a glucose on the stem chain .
Due to the way glycogen is synthesised , every glycogen granule has at its core a glycogenin protein .
Glycogen in muscle , liver , and fat cells is stored in a hydrated form , composed of three or four parts of water per part of glycogen associated with 0.45 millimoles ( 18 mg ) of potassium per gram of glycogen .
FUNCTIONS LIVER Section::::Functions .
Section::::Liver .
As a meal containing carbohydrates or protein is eaten and digested , blood glucose levels rise , and the pancreas secretes insulin .
Blood glucose from the portal vein enters liver cells ( hepatocytes ) .
Insulin acts on the hepatocytes to stimulate the action of several enzymes , including glycogen synthase .
Glucose molecules are added to the chains of glycogen as long as both insulin and glucose remain plentiful .
In this postprandial or " fed " state , the liver takes in more glucose from the blood than it releases .
After a meal has been digested and glucose levels begin to fall , insulin secretion is reduced , and glycogen synthesis stops .
When it is needed for energy , glycogen is broken down and converted again to glucose .
Glycogen phosphorylase is the primary enzyme of glycogen breakdown .
For the next 8–12 hours , glucose derived from liver glycogen is the primary source of blood glucose used by the rest of the body for fuel .
Glucagon , another hormone produced by the pancreas , in many respects serves as a countersignal to insulin .
In response to insulin levels being below normal ( when blood levels of glucose begin to fall below the normal range ) , glucagon is secreted in increasing amounts and stimulates both glycogenolysis ( the breakdown of glycogen ) and gluconeogenesis ( the production of glucose from other sources ) .
MUSCLE Section::::Muscle .
Muscle cell glycogen appears to function as an immediate reserve source of available glucose for muscle cells .
Other cells that contain small amounts use it locally , as well .
As muscle cells lack glucose-6-phosphatase , which is required to pass glucose into the blood , the glycogen they store is available solely for internal use and is not shared with other cells .
This is in contrast to liver cells , which , on demand , readily do break down their stored glycogen into glucose and send it through the blood stream as fuel for other organs .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Glycogen was discovered by Claude Bernard .
His experiments showed that the liver contained a substance that could give rise to reducing sugar by the action of a " ferment " in the liver .
By 1857 , he described the isolation of a substance he called " la matière glycogène " , or " sugar - forming substance " .
Soon after the discovery of glycogen in the liver , A. Sanson found that muscular tissue also contains glycogen .
The empirical formula for glycogen of ( ) was established by Kekulé in 1858 .
METABOLISM SYNTHESIS Section::::Metabolism .
Section::::Synthesis .
Glycogen synthesis is , unlike its breakdown , endergonic — it requires the input of energy .
Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from uridine triphosphate ( UTP ) , which reacts with glucose-1-phosphate , forming UDP - glucose , in a reaction catalysed by UTP — glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase .
Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of UDP - glucose initially by the protein glycogenin , which has two tyrosine anchors for the reducing end of glycogen , since glycogenin is a homodimer .
After about eight glucose molecules have been added to a tyrosine residue , the enzyme glycogen synthase progressively lengthens the glycogen chain using UDP - glucose , adding α(1→4)-bonded glucose to the reducing end of the glycogen chain .
The glycogen branching enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of six or seven glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule .
The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues , and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains .
BREAKDOWN Section::::Breakdown .
Glycogen is cleaved from the nonreducing ends of the chain by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase to produce monomers of glucose-1-phosphate :
In vivo , phosphorolysis proceeds in the direction of glycogen breakdown because the ratio of phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate is usually greater than 100 .
Glucose-1-phosphate is then converted to glucose 6-phosphate ( G6P ) by phosphoglucomutase .
A special debranching enzyme is needed to remove the α(1 - 6 ) branches in branched glycogen and reshape the chain into a linear polymer .
The G6P monomers produced have three possible fates :
* G6P can continue on the glycolysis pathway and be used as fuel .
* G6P can enter the pentose phosphate pathway via the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase to produce NADPH and 5-carbon sugars .
*
In the liver and kidney , G6P can be dephosphorylated back to glucose by the enzyme glucose
6-phosphatase .
This is the final step in the gluconeogenesis pathway .
CLINICAL RELEVANCE DISORDERS OF GLYCOGEN METABOLISM Section::::Clinical relevance .
Section::::Disorders of glycogen metabolism .
The most common disease in which glycogen metabolism becomes abnormal is diabetes , in which , because of abnormal amounts of insulin , liver glycogen can be abnormally accumulated or depleted .
Restoration of normal glucose metabolism usually normalizes glycogen metabolism , as well .
In hypoglycemia caused by excessive insulin , liver glycogen levels are high , but the high insulin levels prevent the glycogenolysis necessary to maintain normal blood sugar levels .
Glucagon is a common treatment for this type of hypoglycemia .
Various inborn errors of metabolism are caused by deficiencies of enzymes necessary for glycogen synthesis or breakdown .
These are collectively referred to as glycogen storage diseases .
GLYCOGEN DEPLETION AND ENDURANCE EXERCISE Section::::Glycogen depletion and endurance exercise .
Long - distance athletes , such as marathon runners , cross - country skiers , and cyclists , often experience glycogen depletion , where almost all of the athlete 's glycogen stores are depleted after long periods of exertion without sufficient carbohydrate consumption .
This phenomenon is referred to as " hitting the wall " .
Glycogen depletion can be forestalled in three possible ways .
First , during exercise , carbohydrates with the highest possible rate of conversion to blood glucose ( high glycemic index ) are ingested continuously .
The best possible outcome of this strategy replaces about 35 % of glucose consumed at heart rates above about 80 % of maximum .
Second , through endurance training adaptations and specialized regimens ( e.g. fasting low - intensity endurance training ) , the body can condition type I muscle fibers to improve both fuel use efficiency and workload capacity to increase the percentage of fatty acids used as fuel , sparing carbohydrate use from all sources .
Third , by consuming large quantities of carbohydrates after depleting glycogen stores as a result of exercise or diet , the body can increase storage capacity of intramuscular glycogen stores .
This process is known as carbohydrate loading .
In general , glycemic index of carbohydrate source does not matter since muscular insulin sensitivity is increased as a result of temporary glycogen depletion .
When experiencing glycogen debt , athletes often experience extreme fatigue to the point that it is difficult to move .
As a reference , the very best professional cyclists in the world will usually finish a 4- to 5-hr stage race right at the limit of glycogen depletion using the first three strategies .
When athletes ingest both carbohydrate and caffeine following exhaustive exercise , their glycogen stores tend to be replenished more rapidly ; however , the minimum dose of caffeine at which there is a clinically significant effect on glycogen repletion has not been established .
