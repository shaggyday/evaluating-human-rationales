She also enjoys casual dating and refuses to fall in love .
One day , after an appointment , she is told by Dr. Julian Goldstein that she has terminal cancer .
He is deeply impressed by the way Marley accepts the news with humour and dignity .
While under anesthetic , God appears to Marley in heaven and asks her to make three wishes .
She chooses to fly , to win a million dollars ( not tax free ) , and a third that is later revealed .
Marley tells her friends the news , including her parents who separated years earlier and do n't speak now .
Her mother is persistent and overbearing , and instantly begins to smother Marley by visiting too often and making her meals to keep her strength up .
Marley 's father is the opposite ; distant and reserved , and does n't seem bothered with reconnecting with Marley with the time she has left .
While driving through town one morning , Marley and her friend Sarah decide to take part in a radio call game where the 97th caller wins a prize .
They get through and Marley is told she 's won flying lessons - her first wish granted .
Her other friend Renee is pregnant with her second child .

One night , they see each other at a band night at their local bar and decide to spend the rest of the night by going on a date .
They start to develop feelings for one another .
Marley tells her boss about the cancer and he asks her about her life insurance plans , since their company has a policy that anybody who has a life - threatening illness can cash out , gaining a million dollars ( $ 500,000 dollars after tax ) instantly - her second wish .
After another date , Marley and Julian sleep together and begin a relationship .
However , she soon starts to feel dismayed when she comes to the realisation that they wo n't have a future together , and flees quickly one morning before he wakes .
That afternoon , they argue in the park and Marley breaks it off .
She becomes distant from and jealous of her friends who are all going through positive changes .
After visiting heaven in her dreams for a second time , God makes her realise that she needs to cherish what she has while she 's still alive and , for the first time , Marley admits to being in love .
Later that day , she visits Julian to rekindle their relationship , apologizes to the friends she has pushed away and even makes peace with her father .
At home over the following weeks , Marley is able to do nothing but lie in bed , and starts focusing on all of the things she is going to miss .
She writes cards for special occasions she wo n't be around for in the future and writes letters to her loved ones , giving them all to her mother for her to give out at the right times .
One morning , Marley and Sarah sit in the park .
Marley confesses to Sarah that she is no longer afraid to die , even though Sarah is terrified at the prospect of having to live without her .
Marley drifts off and Sarah is unable to wake her .
Knowing it 's almost time , Marley is visited by everyone in the hospital who surround her bed and wait with her until the end .
The exception is Renee , who is in labor with her son .
