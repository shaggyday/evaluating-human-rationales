PLOT Section::::Plot .
A group of friends , Amy ( Susan May Pratt ) , James ( Richard Speight , Jr. ) , Zach ( Niklaus Lange ) , Lauren ( Ali Hillis ) , Dan ( Eric Dane ) , and Dan 's new girlfriend Michelle ( Cameron Richardson ) go for a weekend cruise on Dan 's new yacht .
Amy and James also bring their infant daughter , Sarah .
Most of the friends decide to jump into the water for a swim .
Amy , who is hydrophobic after a childhood incident , refuses but Dan picks her up and dives in with her .
However , nobody thought to lower the ladder to re - board the ship , and so everyone ( except the baby ) is trapped in the water with only two masks , a dive knife , and a toy dolphin float .
Despite their efforts , the side of the yacht is too smooth to climb and the deck is too high to reach .
They see a boat of teenagers heading towards them .
The group try to grab their attention , but the teenagers think that they are just greeting them , and sail off .
During the struggle , the group try using a phone to call for help , only to hear the voices of some well wishers , unable to get the caller 's attention .
The phone accidentally gets knocked in the water .
They are left to tread water disconsolately .
The group resorts to removing and using their bathing suits to make a rope .
After a couple of attempts they manage to get one end of the rope wrapped around a railing .
Instead of having the lightest person climb up , Zach attempts to climb .
He pulls himself up and his fingers brush the gunwale but the makeshift rope rips apart as he is too heavy .
The group are now mostly naked and have only a partial rope .
Meanwhile , James goes underwater , and is fooling around with the prop , in an attempt to remove it and use it as a grappling hook , but he drops the knife .
He swims down after it and manages to catch it , and desperately tries to swim for the surface .
As he swims back up he crashes into the bottom of the boat , and is knocked unconscious .
He resurfaces motionlessly and slightly bloodied with an apparent skull fracture .
Zach gets the knife from James and starts stabbing the boat to climb back up .
Dan tries to stop Zach , but accidentally stabs him , causing Zach to drop the knife .
In a fit of hysteria and fearing that sharks will be attracted by the blood , Michelle begins to swim away , but sinks underwater .
Dan swims after her and sees her lifeless body drifting underwater .
He dives after her , but he ca n't reach her , and her body disappears into the depths .
After some time , Zach dies from blood loss in Lauren 's arms .
She reluctantly lets go of his body which floats away , face down .
After much waiting , Lauren says she refuses to die treading water and attempts to swim back to shore to find help .
Her fate after this is unknown .
Later that night , during a rainstorm , James dies from his head injury .
Dan unsuccessfully searches underwater for the knife .
He slams his mask on the hull in frustration and the lens pops out .
Remembering Zach 's attempt with the knife , Dan uses it to wedge in the crevice of the side door for the ladder , giving him a handhold .
Amy climbs over his shoulders , finally stepping onto his hand wrapped around the lens , causing him to yell as his hand bleeds more and manages to grab the gunwale and pull herself back on board .
Once on board , she lowers the ladder for Dan and tends to her baby , Sarah .
Amy notices Dan swimming away to drown out of guilt .
She jumps back in to save him , reminding her of when she attempted to save her father in the same manner , at a young age .
The next morning , a fishing boat approaches the yacht , and notices the lowered ladder and life ring still floating in the water - no one had pulled them in .
The yacht appears empty except for the sound of Sarah crying on the lower deck .
The film cuts to Amy standing on the boat in the sun , looking around appearing heartbroken .
Dan is shown lying face down on the boat with a towel covering his lower half , seemingly sleeping .
