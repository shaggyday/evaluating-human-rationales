PLOT Section::::Plot .
Cole Carter ( Zac Efron ) , a former track star , college dropout , and struggling 23-year - old DJ in the electronic dance music ( EDM ) scene , dreams of becoming a major record producer .
He constantly reminds himself that his plan to rise to the top consists of three things : a laptop , some talent , and one track .
Cole finally books a gig to DJ at a local nightclub , where he meets the headliner , a once - innovative DJ , James Reed ( Wes Bentley ) .
James invites Cole to a party where Cole starts to hallucinate because a joint they shared contained Phencyclidine ( PCP ) .
The morning after , Cole wakes up at James ' house where he is introduced to Sophie ( Emily Ratajkowski ) , James ' girlfriend and personal assistant , who voluntarily drives him home to his shack .
Later , James calls Cole to serve as a DJ at his house party , a paid gig .
James sees potential in Cole and takes him as his student .
After listening to Cole 's original song , James criticizes Cole for imitating other well - known producers , like Skrillex , and he openly suggests to use organic sounds for an original vibe .
The two then co - create a song together using that technique , along with vocals from Sophie , which is met with success at the local nightclub .
Cole and his friends head to Las Vegas for a music festival , where he strays away from his group to meet up with Sophie , who James ditched .
Sophie then gives Cole MDMA , and they quickly fall for each other .
Back in San Fernando , James invites Cole over to watch an MMA fight with him and Sophie .
An awkward moment ends up with Sophie telling Cole to accept what happened and to leave it alone , and James gives Cole a new MacBook Pro and the opportunity to open for him at Summer Fest , a popular music festival .
One day , Cole and Paige ( Jon Bernthal ) meet up with Tanya Romero ( Alicia Coppola ) , whose house is undergoing foreclosure .
During the negotiation , Paige buys her house and rents it back to her , with the intention to sell it quickly for a substantial price , which angers Cole .
While James ' alcoholism begins to affect Sophie , he and Cole go to a strip club for his birthday .
Cole falls ill and James finds out about Cole 's relationship with Sophie , severing ties with him .
Returning to his three friends , it is revealed that Squirrel has been looking for better jobs due to his intellect and Mason has rented a house for all of them .
After intense partying with drugs and alcohol , Squirrel is found unconscious that morning , and later dies from an overdose .
After the funeral , the remaining friends begin to question their future , ending up going their separate ways when Mason blames Ollie for the drugs that Squirrel overdosed on .
Cole visits James , whose alcoholism has completely consumed him , to let him know of Squirrel 's death and that it could have possibly have been his fault , to which James consoles him and also tells him that Sophie moved to the San Fernando Valley and works at a local coffee shop , where he later visits her .
While taking a run , the battery of Cole 's phone goes dead , causing his music to stop playing .
Upon closer observation , he listens to his surroundings , which inspires him to record samples and integrate it into his long - awaited track .
Cole then calls and tells James that he has something for Summer Fest , and James gives him another chance .
The festival is set outside the American Apparel building in Los Angeles .
Cole releases his track , which contains snippets of his conversations with Sophie and Squirrel , and he later uses Squirrel 's quote " Are We Ever Going To Be Better Than This ? " as a hook before the beat drop .
When the song ends , Cole is met with enthusiastic acclaim from the audience and James .
The film concludes with Sophie going back to college , Ollie reading for an audition , Mason handling the nightclub , and Cole remaining positive about his future and creating a proper relationship with Sophie .
In the mid - credits scene , Tanya opens her front door to an Adidas box that Cole has been saving all of his earnings in throughout the film .
