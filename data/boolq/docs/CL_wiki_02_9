LIST OF MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL NO - HITTERS
This is a list of no - hitters in Major League Baseball history .
In addition , all no - hitters that were broken up in extra innings or were in shortened games are listed , although they are not currently considered official no - hitters .
( Prior to 1991 , a performance in which no hits were surrendered through nine innings or in a shortened game was considered an official no - hit game . )
The names of those pitchers who threw a perfect game no - hitter are italicized .
For combined no - hitters by two or more pitchers on the same team , each is listed with his number of innings pitched .
Games which were part of a doubleheader are noted as either the first game or second game .
The most recent no - hitter was pitched by James Paxton of the Seattle Mariners on May 8 , 2018 .
An official no - hit game occurs when a pitcher ( or pitchers ) allows no hits during the entire course of a game , which consists of at least nine innings thrown by the pitcher(s ) .
In a no - hit game , a batter may still reach base via a walk , an error , a fielder 's choice , an intentional walk , a hit by pitch , a passed ball or wild pitch on strike three , or catcher 's interference .
Also , due to these methods of reaching base , it is possible for a team to score runs without getting any hits .
While the vast majority of no - hitters are shutouts , no - hit teams have managed to score runs in their respective games a number of times .
Five times a team has been no - hit and still won the game : two notable victories occurred when the Cincinnati Reds defeated the Houston Colt .45s
( now called the Houston Astros ) 1–0 on April 23 , 1964 even though they were no - hit by Houston starter Ken Johnson , and the Detroit Tigers defeated the Baltimore Orioles 2–1 on April 30 , 1967 even though they were no - hit by Baltimore starter Steve Barber and reliever Stu Miller .
In another four games , the home team won despite gaining no hits through eight innings , but these are near no - hitters under the 1991 rule that nine no - hit innings must be completed in order for a no - hitter to be credited .
The pitcher who holds the record for the shortest time between no - hitters is Johnny Vander Meer , the only pitcher in history to throw no - hitters in consecutive starts , while playing for the Cincinnati Reds in 1938 .
Besides Vander Meer , Allie Reynolds ( in 1951 ) , Virgil Trucks ( in 1952 ) , Nolan Ryan ( in 1973 ) , and Max Scherzer ( in 2015 ) are the only other major leaguers to throw two no - hitters in the same regular season .
Jim Maloney technically threw two no - hitters in the 1965 season , but his first one ended after he allowed a home run in the top of the 11th inning .
According to the rules interpretation of the time , this was considered a no - hitter .
Later that season , Maloney once again took a no - hitter into extra innings , but this time he managed to preserve the no - hitter after the Reds scored in the top half of the tenth , becoming the first pitcher to throw a complete game extra inning no - hitter since Fred Toney in 1917 .
Roy Halladay threw two no - hitters in 2010 : a perfect game during the regular season and a no - hitter in the 2010 National League Division Series .
He is the only major leaguer to have thrown no - hitters in regular season and postseason play .
The first black pitcher to toss a no - hitter was Sam Jones who did it for the Chicago Cubs in 1955 .
The first Latin pitcher to throw one was San Francisco Giant Juan Marichal in 1963 .
The first Asian pitcher to throw one was Los Angeles Dodger Hideo Nomo in 1996 .
Through May 8 , 2018 , there have been 299 no - hitters officially recognized by Major League Baseball , 256 of them in the modern era ( starting in 1901 , with the formation of the American League ) .
Joe Borden 's no - hitter in 1875 is also noted , but is not recognized by Major League Baseball ( see note in the chart ) .

NEAR
NO - HITTERS Section::::Near no - hitters .
Regulation games in which a pitcher or staff pitches less than nine full innings , or in which a hit is allowed in extra innings , do not qualify as no - hitters .
However , before the rules were tightened in 1991 , such games did count as official no - hitters .
REGULATION NO - HIT LOSSES ENDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NINTH Section::::Regulation no - hit losses ending in the middle of the ninth .
Owing to the fact that the home team does not bat in the bottom of the ninth inning if they are leading after the top , a visiting pitcher ( or pitchers ) may complete a full game without allowing a hit but not be credited with an official no - hitter .
If the visiting team allows a sufficient number of runs for the home team to win after the top of the ninth , whether by walks , errors , or anything else not involving hits , the pitcher(s ) will not be credited with an official no - hitter because they only pitched eight innings ( though such no - hitters were counted before 1991 ) .
This has happened only four times in major - league history .
