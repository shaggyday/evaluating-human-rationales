Section::::Technical specifications .
Section::::Physical .
The GBA SP is slightly more than half the size of the GBA when closed and roughly the height of Nintendo 's Game Boy Color when open .
This model of the Game Boy can play all Game Boy cartridges including Game Boy , Game Boy Color , and Game Boy Advance carts .
The clamshell ( or laptop design ) protects the screen from scratches and dust , reminiscent of two - screen Game & Watch units .
However , the casing is made from a different material , making it more prone to scratches than previous Game Boy systems .
The slot for cartridges has been moved to the bottom of the system , facing down .
This makes using special cartridges , such as the Game Boy Camera and Kirby : Tilt and Tumble , very difficult .
The GBA SP AC adapter comes with the package to recharge its lithium ion battery , something previous Game Boys did not have ( they usually used commercially available batteries ) .
This adapter is also compatible with the original version of the DS .
The software library and general hardware specifications are identical to those of the Game Boy Advance .
In Japan it was released in a variety of standard colors and special packages .
In most other regions it was released in Platinum Silver and Charcoal Black .
Later , a Flame Red version was released .
Six special editions have also been released : a NES Classics model with the same color scheme as a classic NES controller ( and designed to resemble a NES deck when closed ) , a SpongeBob SquarePants model , a Pikachu model , and a silver model with a tattoo design printed on it , known as the ' Tribal Edition ' .
In other regions , such as Europe , Asia , and the Middle East , additional colors have been released , such as Pearl Green and Starlight Gold .
Additionally , two new special versions have been released in Asia exclusive to that region .
Nintendo was planning to have the SP be 3D - compatible , but the resolution of LCD was too low , resulting in Nintendo scrapping it .

HEADPHONE JACK
Section::::Headphone jack .
Nintendo removed the TRS headphone jack from the SP , which had been included on all previous Game Boy models .
Headphones designed specifically for the GBA SP can be purchased , or standard headphones can be attached with an optional , stereophonic adapter that plugs into the same port as the AC adapter .
As both AC adapter and headphones use the same port , it is not possible to charge the SP and listen to headphones at the same time with the Nintendo brand adapter .
There are , however , third - party solutions , such as an adapter that " splits " into two different cords ; the power jack on one side , and a TS headphone jack on the other .
BACKLIT MODEL ( AGS-101 )
Section::::Backlit Model ( AGS-101 ) .
In September 2005 , around the time of the Game Boy Micro 's release , Nintendo released an improved version of the Game Boy Advance SP in North America , featuring a brighter backlit screen instead of the previous version 's frontlit screen .
The new model can be distinguished by the following features :
* The box states " Now with a BRIGHTER backlit screen ! " to distinguish the new model from the older , frontlit models .
*
The backlit SP has the Model Number AGS-101 on the label on the bottom of the unit , whereas the original frontlit SP has the Model Number AGS-001
* The mini button at the top center of the console 's lower face is now referred to in the manual as the " Brightness Switch " and selects between two levels of brightness , " Normal " ( Low ) and " Bright " ( High ) with no off setting .
On the frontlit models this button turned the frontlight on or off only .
With the backlight set to " Normal " ( Low ) the brightness still surpasses the original AGS-001 with the frontlight on .
*
When powered off , the backlit model 's screen is completely black , but the frontlit model 's screen is noticeably lighter .
The North American backlit version comes in three standard colors : " Pearl Blue " , " Pearl Pink " and " Graphite " ( a greyer version of Onyx Black ) .
There were also two Toys " R " Us exclusive backlit models ; a " SpongeBob SquarePants " model and a " Limited Edition Pikachu " model .
In 2006 , the AGS-101 backlit model also saw a very limited release in Europe .
Few models made it to market , likely due to the release of the Game Boy Advance - compatible Nintendo DS one year prior .
The European version was released in " Surf Blue " as well as re - issued in " Pink " and " Tribal " editions .
Unlike the North American release , the European box does not feature any prominent text to distinguish the backlit models from the older frontlit models .
In addition , only the " Surf Blue " color was unique to the AGS-101 , the other two colors " Pink " and " Tribal " had already been released as frontlit models - for these reasons it can be very difficult to identify a European backlit SP .
Apart from the AGS-101 model number on the base of the unit , the only other obvious distinguishing feature of the European backlit model is the large picture of the Game Boy Advance SP featured on the front of the box .
( The European frontlit models of " Pink " and " Tribal " only feature small pictures of the Game Boy Advance SP on the sides of the box and Flower / Tattoo patterns on the front respectively . )
RECEPTION Section::::Reception .
" M. Wiley " of IGN called the Game Boy Advance SP " a step in the right direction for Nintendo " , praising the system 's new redesign over the original GBA and highlighting its inclusion of a backlit screen and rechargeable battery , although minor criticism went towards the system 's omission of a headphone jack .
Engadget gave it a global score of 84 out of 100 , also praising the new features of the redesign while noting the system 's lack of a headphone jack .
Matthew D. Sarrel of PC Magazine suggested it to consumers as an improvement over the original model , praising the backlight and integration of a charger as well as improved visual quality , though he noted that players with larger hands may find difficulty with the system 's design .
