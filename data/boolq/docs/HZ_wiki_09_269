Section::::Kingdom Hearts Final Mix .
Kingdom Hearts follows the adventures of Sora , a cheerful teenager who fights against the forces of darkness .
He is joined by Donald Duck , Goofy and other Disney characters who help him on his quest .
In the original and Final Mix versions of Kingdom Hearts , the command menu had four commands : Attack , Magic , Items , and a fourth context - sensitive slot that varied depending on what the player had targeted , where they were , etc .
The command menu has been updated to include " Attack " , " Magic " , " Items " , and " Summons " in the fourth slot , which was originally located as a sub - category beneath the " Magic " menu .
The original fourth command has been replaced by the introduction of Reaction Commands from Kingdom Hearts II and are triggered by pressing the Triangle Button .
The camera works more similarly to that of Kingdom Hearts II , utilizing the right thumb stick to move the camera and allowing the player to click the R3 button to reset the camera behind Sora , as opposed to the original game which made use of the shoulder triggers L2 and R2 to position the camera .

The other two lowly offerings are inessential bonus features .
"
Joystiq gave a positive , unscored review , saying the collection " captures that early era of the franchise at its purest simplicity .

"

1.5 Remix presents a couple of the earliest games in the beloved series in their best light and makes a revealing cinematic experience out of a third one .
The three experiences complement one another with unique elements and welcome context that is a treat for longtime fans and newcomers alike . "
Giving the game a 7.5 out of 10 , GameTrailers felt that , " While Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 ReMIX certainly lives up to the HD part of its name , the collection is not without its shortcomings .
The original game 's inclusion with all the new revisions and the addition of Final Mix content is a worthy investment on its own , and the inclusion of Chain of Memories is a nice gesture .
The card - based battle system might be off - putting , but it 's a unique experiment that deviates from the norm of the series .
However , despite the overhauled visuals and new voice work , it 's hard to excuse the reduction of 358/2 Days to a lengthy film rather than an actual game .
" IGN felt that the collection was " an excellent way to replay the series ' first two games in crisp , high - definition splendor " but was disappointed that the box art did not properly distinguish 358/2 Days as a non - playable game .
They awarded the collection an 8.5 out of 10 .
Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the collection an 8 out of 10 , stating the collection " brings a PS2 classic to the modern age with a noticeably impressive visual update , improved camera controls , and , for added fun , secondary and tertiary Kingdom Hearts content all contained on one disc .
