WRESTLING
AT
THE SUMMER OLYMPICS Wrestling had been contested at the Summer Olympic Games since the sport was introduced in the ancient Olympic Games in 708 BC .
When the modern Olympic Games resumed in Athens in 1896 , wrestling ( in the form of Greco - Roman wrestling ) became a focus of the Games , with the exception of the 1900 Summer Olympics when wrestling did not appear on the program .
Freestyle wrestling and weight classes both made their first appearance in 1904 .
The women 's competition was introduced in 2004 .
In February 2013 , the IOC voted to drop wrestling from the Summer Olympic programme , effective 2020 ; the president of the sport 's governing body FILA ( now United World Wrestling ) resigned after a subsequent motion of no confidence .
Following changes in leadership , and revisions to the programme for 2016 ( including rule changes and additional women 's competitions ) , wrestling successfully campaigned to be readmitted to the Summer Olympic programme .
REMOVAL AND REINSTATEMENT Section::::Removal and reinstatement .
In an effort to control the size and costs of the Summer Olympics , and make the Games " relevant to sports fans of all generations " , the IOC evaluated the Olympic event programme in place for the 2016 Summer Olympics , and voted on 25 " core " sports that would comprise the programme of the 2020 Summer Olympics .
One vacancy was to be left open for a new sport .
In February 2013 , IOC members voted to remove wrestling from the Olympic programme ; The New York Times cited several potential factors in the decision , including the lack of universally - known talent unlike other sports , and concern for the lack of women 's competitions in wrestling ( having only introduced women 's freestyle competitions in 2004 ) .
FILA ( now United World Wrestling ) , the governing body of Olympic wrestling , immediately criticized the decision .
The organization cited wrestling 's long - standing history as an Olympic event , which dates as far back as the ancient Olympic Games .
The decision resulted in immediate backlash ; Armen Nazaryan and Sagid Murtazaliev both returned gold medals to the IOC in protest , while Nazaryan also staged a hunger strike until the 2013 European Wrestling Championships .
FILA president Raphaël Martinetti resigned after a vote of non - confidence by the organization 's staff .
Martinetti was replaced as acting president by Nenad Lalovic .
Under his leadership , the organization began to make changes to its Olympic programme for 2016 , including rule changes designed to make bouts faster and encourage more aggression , as well as additional women 's weight classes .
These changes were intended to help improve audience interest , and address the shortcomings that likely led to the removal of the sport ; wrestling joined baseball / softball , as well as squash , on a final shortlist of three sports to be included in the core Olympic programme for 2020 .
On 8 September 2013 , at the 125th IOC Session , the IOC selected wrestling to be reinstated in the Olympic program for 2020 and 2024 .
Lalović was largely credited for his role in the reinstatement ; he remarked that " normally this is done in a few years , we did it in a few months .
It was a question of our survival . "
