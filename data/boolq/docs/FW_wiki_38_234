LEGAL STATUS OF TATTOOING IN THE UNITED STATES
In the United States , there is no federal law regulating the practice of tattooing .
However , all 50 states and the District of Columbia have statutory laws requiring a person receiving a tattoo be 18 years or older .
This is partially based on the legal principle that a minor can not enter into a legal contract or otherwise render informed consent for a procedure .
Most states permit a person under the age of 18 to receive a tattoo with permission of a parent or guardian , but some states outright prohibit tattooing under a certain age regardless of permission , with the exception of medical necessity ( such as markings placed for radiation therapy ) .
In all jurisdictions , individual tattooists may also choose to place additional restrictions based on their own moral feelings , such as refusing any clients under a specific age even with parental consent despite it being legal , or limiting the type and/or location of where they are willing to tattoo ( such as refusing any work around intimate parts of the body ) .
They may additionally refuse to perform specific artwork , including if they merely find it inappropriate or offensive , or refuse to work on a client that they suspect may be intoxicated .
Artists sometimes claim their personal business restrictions are a matter of law even when it is not true , so as to avoid arguments with clients .
