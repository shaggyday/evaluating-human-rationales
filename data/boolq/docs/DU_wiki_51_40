NEW YORK LOTTERY
The New York Lottery began in 1967 as the third modern U.S. lottery , after Puerto Rico 's began in 1934 , and New Hampshire 's in 1964 .
As part of the New York State Gaming Commission , it provides revenue for public education and is based in Schenectady .
OVERVIEW Section::::Overview .
Players must be at least 18 ( including video lottery ) ; however , the minimum is 21 for Quick Draw ( a keno game drawn four minutes apart ) where alcohol is served .
Lottery winnings are subject to state and Federal income taxes .
New York City and Yonkers residents also are subject to local income taxes .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Prior to the 20th century , lotteries were used in New York to raise revenue for non - educational needs .
New York City Hall was built in part with lottery proceeds .
Other lotteries helped build and repair canals , roads , ferries , and bridges .
Lotteries also were held for non - public needs .
They helped develop New York City 's manufacturing industries .
Churches were built , rebuilt , or improved with lottery funds .
On November 8 , 1966 , New Yorkers voted to approve a constitutional amendment authorizing a government - run lottery .
The referendum passed with over 60 % in favor .
The proceeds of the Lottery were to be " applied exclusively to , or in aid or support of education . "
In 1967 , the New York Legislature created a Division of the Lottery and a Lottery Commission within the Department of Taxation and Finance .
The Lottery later became an autonomous unit within the Department of Taxation and Finance .
Under the New York State Lottery for Education Law , the director of the Division of the Lottery has full authority over the administration of the Lottery .
The Lottery began in 1967 ; its first slogan was " Your Chance of a Lifetime to Help Education " .
It has generated over $ 34 billion in aid to education revenue .
The original intent of the lottery was to provide funds for education .
New York governor Hugh Carey suspended sales for about nine months in 1975 - 76 due to a scandal involving unsold tickets being selected as winners .
Another scandal in 1986 involved state employees manipulating mail - in tickets in a mail room to result in over $ 40,000 in winning to friends and family .
The first big winner of the Lottery was Lou Eisenberg , who won $ 5 million in 1981 ; in that era , winners could not choose cash in lieu of annuity payments .
An agreement between Mega Millions and Powerball was reached in October 2009 .
All lotteries then with either game were allowed to sell tickets for both games beginning January 31 , 2010 ; New York was among those which joined the " other " game on that date .
On February 1 , 2013 , the Lottery 's operations were merged with that of the New York State Racing and Wagering Board to form the New York State Gaming Commission .
CRITICISM Section::::Criticism .
Despite it being the lottery with the highest sales in the United States of traditional draw games , the New York Lottery has been increasingly criticized for offering low payout percentages ; and , until 2013 , not allowing scratch - game winners of annuitized prizes to choose cash in lieu of periodic payments .
New York Lotto , begun in 1978 , which has the lowest payout ( of each dollar wagered no more than 40 cents are paid to players ) of a U.S. lottery game .
( In the 2011 - 12 fiscal year , sales of New York Lotto were down almost 15 % from the previous 12 months ; its minimum rollovers are now only $ 300,000 annuity . )
A claim on or after May 1 , 2013 of an annuitized scratch - game prize ( including " lifetime " prizes ) allows the winner to choose lump sum in lieu of the periodic payments ; the New York Lottery had been phasing in scratch games with all - cash prizes of at least $ 1,000,000 .
