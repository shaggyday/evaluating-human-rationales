STRONG ELECTROLYTE
A strong electrolyte is a solution / solute that completely , or almost completely , ionizes or dissociates in a solution .
These ions are good conductors of electric current in the solution .
Originally , a " strong electrolyte " was defined as a chemical that , when in aqueous solution , is a good conductor of electricity .
With greater understanding of the properties of ions in solution its definition was replaced by the present one .
A concentrated solution of this strong electrolyte has a lower vapor pressure than that of pure water at the same temperature .
Strong acids , strong bases and soluble ionic salts that are not weak acids or weak bases are strong electrolytes .
A substance whose aqueous solution or molten state decomposed into ions by passing electricity is known as electrolytes .
WRITING REACTIONS
Section::::Writing reactions .
For strong electrolytes , a single reaction arrow shows that the reaction occurs completely in one direction , in contrast to the dissociation of weak electrolytes , which both ionize and re - bond in significant quantities .
Strong electrolytes conduct electricity only when molten or in aqueous solutions .
Strong electrolytes break apart into ions completely .
The stronger an electrolyte the greater the voltage produced when used in a galvanic cell .
