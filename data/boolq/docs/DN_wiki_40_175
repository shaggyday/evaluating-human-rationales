ROCKY STEPS
The 72 stone steps before the entrance of the Philadelphia Museum of Art , in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , have become known as the " Rocky Steps " as a result of the scene from the film Rocky .
Tourists often mimic Rocky 's famous climb , a metaphor for an underdog or an everyman rising to a challenge .
A bronze Rocky statue was briefly situated at the top of the steps for the filming of Rocky III .
This statue , now located at the bottom right of the steps , is a popular photo opportunity for visitors .
The top of the steps offers a commanding view of Eakins Oval , the Benjamin Franklin Parkway , and Philadelphia City Hall .
In 2006 , Rocky creator Sylvester Stallone recounted the genesis of the iconic scene : ( while filming the 1976 movie ) the film crew , bound by a tight budget , identified the steps one night while searching for filming locations around the city .
Stallone first thought Rocky should carry his dog Butkus up the steps , but the big bull mastiff proved too heavy for the scene to work .
Still , the view from the top of the stairs inspired him to reshoot the scene without the dog .
Also in Rocky Balboa , Rocky lifts his dog Punchy when he reaches the top of the steps .
The closing credits of Rocky Balboa show a montage of dozens of people running up the steps .
This scene was one of the first uses in a major film of the Steadicam , a stabilized camera mount that allows its operator to walk and even climb steps while smoothly filming .
BRONZE ROCKY STATUE Section::::Bronze Rocky statue .
Before Rocky III , released in 1982 , Stallone commissioned A. Thomas Schomberg to create a bronze statue of Rocky .
Three 2-ton , 10-foot - tall copies were to be cast .
One was installed atop the steps for the filming of Rocky III , and was ultimately relocated at the bottom of the steps .
The second Rocky is in the San Diego Hall of Champions Sports Museum in San Diego , California .
The third was planned , but was not cast at the time .
A third casting of the statue was put up for auction to raise funds for charities .
The third was listed on eBay three separate times between 2002 - 2005 , with a starting bid of US$ 5,000,000 , then US$ 3,000,000 , and finally US$ 1,000,000 to raise funds for the International Institute for Sport and Olympic History .
In 2006 , Schomberg studios realized the casting mold for the statue was beginning to decay , and had a third and final edition of the statue cast in bronze .
The third statue is currently exhibited at the Schomberg 's gallery in Colorado After filming was complete , a debate arose between the Art Museum and Philadelphia 's Art Commission over the meaning of " art " .
City officials , who argued that the Rocky statue was not " art " but a " movie prop " , eventually moved it to the front of the Philadelphia Spectrum .
It was later returned to the Art Museum for the filming of Rocky V , then brought back to the Spectrum .
The statue was replaced with a bronze inlay of Converse sneaker footprints with the name " Rocky " above them .
On September 8 , 2006 , the Rocky statue was returned to the Art Museum and placed on a pedestal in a grassy area near the foot of the steps to the right of the Museum .
The unveiling ceremony included live music , the debut of the first full trailer for Rocky Balboa , and a free showing of the first Rocky movie .
At the ceremony , Philadelphia Mayor John Street said that the steps were one of Philly 's biggest tourist attractions , and that Stallone , a native New Yorker , had become " the city 's favorite adopted son " .
