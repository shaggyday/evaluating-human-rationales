HISTORY Section::::History .
First introduced as " Peppo " to compete against Dr Pepper , the name was changed to " Mr. Pibb " after Dr Pepper sued The Coca - Cola Company for trademark infringement .
The original test markets for Mr. Pibb in 1972 were located in Waco , Texas , the birthplace of Dr Pepper , before the company moved to Dallas , Texas .
In 1980 , Mr. Pibb was reformulated and marketed with the words " New Taste " printed prominently on the products .
In 2001 , a new formula called Pibb Xtra added cinnamon flavor , replacing the original formula in many parts of the United States .
Today Pibb Xtra is labeled as " artificially flavored spicy cherry soda " .
