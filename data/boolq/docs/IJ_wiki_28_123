BOOK Section::::Book .
The book describes how Maxwell brought a smooth - coated otter back from Iraq and raised it at " Camusfe√†rna " ( the name he used for his house at Sandaig near Glenelg ) , on the west coast of Scotland .
He took the otter , called Mijbil , to the London Zoological Society , where it was decided that this was a previously unknown subspecies , and it was named after him :
Lutrogale perspicillata maxwelli ( or colloquially , " Maxwell 's otter " ) .
The book 's title was taken from a poem by Kathleen Raine , who claimed in her autobiography that Maxwell had been the love of her life .
Her relationship with Maxwell deteriorated after 1956 when she indirectly caused the death of Mijbil .
RECEPTION Section::::Reception .
A reviewer in the Sunday Herald described the book as having " inspired a generation of naturalists " and referred to it as a " classic account of man and wildlife " .
The review calls Ring of Bright Water " one of the most popular wildlife books ever written " , as over two million copies had been sold worldwide by 1999 .
LEGACY Section::::Legacy .
Two sequels were published : The Rocks Remain ( 1963 ) and
Raven Seek Thy Brother ( 1968 ) , which were less idyllic than the first , chronicling accidents and misfortunes involving both the otters and Maxwell 's life .
All three books were republished as Ring of Bright Water :
A Trilogy in 2011 by Nonpareil Books .
The trilogy does not include the full text of the latter two volumes , but removes the tangential travel sections which take place outside Scotland .
