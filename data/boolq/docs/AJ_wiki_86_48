BLOOD – BRAIN BARRIER
The blood – brain barrier ( BBB ) is a highly selective semipermeable border that separates the circulating blood from the brain and extracellular fluid in the central nervous system ( CNS ) .
The blood – brain barrier is formed by endothelial cells of the capillary wall , astrocyte end - feet ensheathing the capillary , and pericytes embedded in the capillary basement membrane .
This system allows the passage of water , some gases , and lipid - soluble molecules by passive diffusion , as well as the selective transport of molecules such as glucose and amino acids that are crucial to neural function .
Specialized structures participating in sensory and secretory integration within neural circuits – the circumventricular organs and choroid plexus – do not have a blood – brain barrier .
The blood – brain barrier restricts the diffusion of solutes in the blood ( e.g. , bacteria ) and large or hydrophilic molecules into the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , while allowing the diffusion of hydrophobic molecules ( O , CO , hormones ) and small polar molecules .
Cells of the barrier actively transport metabolic products such as glucose across the barrier using specific transport proteins .
STRUCTURE
Section::::Structure .
This " barrier " results from the selectivity of the tight junctions between endothelial cells in CNS vessels , which restricts the passage of solutes .
At the interface between blood and the brain , endothelial cells are stitched together by these tight junctions , which are composed of smaller subunits , frequently biochemical dimers , that are transmembrane proteins such as occludin , claudins , junctional adhesion molecule ( JAM ) , or ESAM , for example .
Each of these transmembrane proteins is anchored into the endothelial cells by another protein complex that includes ZO-1 and associated proteins .
The blood – brain barrier is composed of high - density cells restricting passage of substances from the bloodstream much more than do the endothelial cells in capillaries elsewhere in the body .
Astrocyte cell projections called astrocytic feet ( also known as " glia limitans " ) surround the endothelial cells of the BBB , providing biochemical support to those cells .
The BBB is distinct from the quite similar blood – cerebrospinal fluid barrier , which is a function of the choroidal cells of the choroid plexus , and from the blood – retinal barrier , which can be considered a part of the whole realm of such barriers .
Several areas of the human brain are not on the brain side of the BBB .
Some examples of this include the circumventricular organs , the roof of the third and fourth ventricles , capillaries in the pineal gland on the roof of the diencephalon and the pineal gland .
The pineal gland secretes the hormone melatonin " directly into the systemic circulation " , thus melatonin is not affected by the blood – brain barrier .
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Development .
Originally , experiments in the 1920s seemed to ( wrongly ) show that the blood – brain barrier ( BBB ) was still immature in newborns .
This was due to an error in methodology ( the osmotic pressure was too high and the delicate embryonal capillary vessels were partially damaged ) .
It was later shown in experiments with a reduced volume of the injected liquids that the markers under investigation could not pass the BBB .
It was reported that those natural substances such as albumin , α-1-fetoprotein or transferrin with elevated plasma concentration in the newborn could not be detected outside of cells in the brain .
The transporter P - glycoprotein exists already in the embryonal endothelium .
The measurement of brain uptake of acetamide , antipyrine , benzyl alcohol , butanol , caffeine , cytosine , phenytoin , ethanol , ethylene glycol , heroin , mannitol , methanol , phenobarbital , propylene glycol , thiourea , and urea in ether - anesthetized newborn vs. adult rabbits shows that newborn rabbit and adult rabbit brain endothelia are functionally similar with respect to lipid - mediated permeability .
These data confirmed that no differences in permeability could be detected between newborn and adult BBB capillaries .
No difference in brain uptake of glucose , amino acids , organic acids , purines , nucleosides , or choline was observed between adult and newborn rabbits .
These experiments indicate that the newborn BBB has restrictive properties similar to that of the adult .
In contrast to suggestions of an immature barrier in young animals , these studies indicate that a sophisticated , selective BBB is operative at birth .
FUNCTION Section::::Function .
The blood – brain barrier acts effectively to protect the brain from circulating pathogens .
Accordingly , blood - borne infections of the brain are rare .
Infections of the brain that do occur are often difficult to treat .
Antibodies are too large to cross the blood – brain barrier , and only certain antibiotics are able to pass .
In some cases , a drug has to be administered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) where it can enter the brain by crossing the blood – cerebrospinal fluid barrier .
The blood – brain barrier may become leaky in select neurological diseases , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , epilepsy , brain trauma and edema , and in systemic diseases , such as liver failure .
The blood – brain barrier becomes more permeable during inflammation , allowing antibiotics and phagocytes to move across the BBB .
However , this also allows bacteria and viruses to infiltrate the blood – brain barrier .
Examples of pathogens that can traverse the blood – brain barrier include Toxoplasma gondii which causes toxoplasmosis , spirochetes like Borrelia ( Lyme disease ) , Group B streptococci which causes meningitis in newborns , and Treponema pallidum which causes syphilis .
Some of these harmful bacteria gain access by releasing cytotoxins like pneumolysin which have a direct toxic effect on brain microvascular endothelium and tight junctions .
CIRCUMVENTRICULAR
ORGANS Section::::Circumventricular organs .
Circumventricular organs ( CVOs ) are individual structures located adjacent to the fourth ventricle or third ventricle in the brain , and are characterized by dense capillary beds with permeable endothelial cells unlike those of the blood – brain barrier .
Included among CVOs having highly permeable capillaries are the area postrema , subfornical organ , vascular organ of the lamina terminalis , median eminence , pineal gland , and three lobes of the pituitary gland .
Permeable capillaries of the sensory CVOs ( area postrema , subfornical organ , vascular organ of the lamina terminalis ) enable rapid detection of circulating signals in systemic blood , while those of the secretory CVOs ( median eminence , pineal gland , pituitary lobes ) facilitate transport of brain - derived signals into the circulating blood .
Consequently , the CVO permeable capillaries are the point of bidirectional blood – brain communication for neuroendocrine function .
SPECIALIZED PERMEABLE
ZONES Section::::Specialized permeable zones .
The border zones between brain tissue " behind " the blood – brain barrier and zones " open " to blood signals in certain CVOs contain specialized hybrid capillaries that are leakier than typical brain capillaries , but not as permeable as CVO capillaries .
Such zones exist at the border of the area postrema – nucleus tractus solitarii ( NTS ) , and median eminence – hypothalamic arcuate nucleus .
These zones appear to function as rapid transit regions for brain structures involved in diverse neural circuits – like the NTS and arcuate nucleus – to rapidly control neurohumoral integration .
The permeable capillary zone shared between the median eminence and hypothalamic arcuate nucleus is augmented by wide pericapillary spaces , facilitating bidirectional flow of solutes between the two structures , and indicating that the median eminence is not only a secretory organ , but may also be a sensory CVO .
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
AS A DRUG TARGET Section::::Clinical significance .
Section::::As
a drug target .
The blood – brain barrier ( BBB ) is formed by the brain capillary endothelium and excludes from the brain ∼100 % of large - molecule neurotherapeutics and more than 98 % of all small - molecule drugs .
Overcoming the difficulty of delivering therapeutic agents to specific regions of the brain presents a major challenge to treatment of most brain disorders .
In its neuroprotective role , the blood – brain barrier functions to hinder the delivery of many potentially important diagnostic and therapeutic agents to the brain .
Therapeutic molecules and antibodies that might otherwise be effective in diagnosis and therapy do not cross the BBB in adequate amounts .
Mechanisms for drug targeting in the brain involve going either " through " or " behind " the BBB .
Modalities for drug delivery in unit doses through the BBB entail its disruption by osmotic means ; biochemically by the use of vasoactive substances such as bradykinin ; or even by localized exposure to high - intensity focused ultrasound ( HIFU ) .
Other methods used to get through the BBB may entail the use of endogenous transport systems , including carrier - mediated transporters such as glucose and amino acid carriers ; receptor - mediated transcytosis for insulin or transferrin ; and the blocking of active efflux transporters such as p - glycoprotein .
However , vectors targeting BBB transporters , such as the transferrin receptor , have been found to remain entrapped in brain endothelial cells of capillaries , instead of being ferried across the BBB into the cerebral parenchyma .
Methods for drug delivery behind the BBB include intracerebral implantation ( such as with needles ) and convection - enhanced distribution .
Mannitol can be used in bypassing the BBB .
NANOPARTICLES Section::::Nanoparticles .
Nanotechnology may also help in the transfer of drugs across the BBB .
Recently , researchers have been trying to build liposomes loaded with nanoparticles to gain access through the BBB .
More research is needed to determine which strategies will be most effective and how they can be improved for patients with brain tumors .
The potential for using BBB opening to target specific agents to brain tumors has just begun to be explored .
Delivering drugs across the blood – brain barrier is one of the most promising applications of nanotechnology in clinical neuroscience .
Nanoparticles could potentially carry out multiple tasks in a predefined sequence , which is very important in the delivery of drugs across the blood – brain barrier .
A significant amount of research in this area has been spent exploring methods of nanoparticle - mediated delivery of antineoplastic drugs to tumors in the central nervous system .
For example , radiolabeled polyethylene glycol coated hexadecylcyanoacrylate nanospheres targeted and accumulated in a rat gliosarcoma .
However , this method is not yet ready for clinical trials , due to the accumulation of the nanospheres in surrounding healthy tissue .
Another , more promising approach , is the coating of polyalkylcyanoacrylate or poly - lactic - co - glycolic acid ( PLGA ) nanoparticles with polysorbate 80 or poloxamer 188 .
Due to this coating the particles adsorb apolipoproteins E or A-1 from the blood and thus interact with the LRP1 or with the scavenger receptor followed by transcytosis across the blood – brain barrier into the brain .
These particles loaded with doxorubicin for the treatment of glioblastomas are presently in
Clinical Phase I. Recently , a novel class of multifunctional nanoparticles known as magneto - electric nanoparticles ( MENs ) has been discovered for externally controlled targeted delivery and release of drug(s ) across BBB as well as wireless stimulation of cells deep in the brain .
This approach depends more on the field control and less on the cellular microenvironment .
In vitro and in vivo ( on mice ) experiments to prove the feasibility of using MENs to release a drug across BBB on demand and wirelessly stimulate the brain have been conducted by the research group of Prof. Sakhrat Khizroev at Florida International University ( FIU ) .
Vascular endothelial cells and associated pericytes are often abnormal in tumors and the blood – brain barrier may not always be intact in brain tumors .
Also , the basement membrane is sometimes incomplete .
Other factors , such as astrocytes , may contribute to the resistance of brain tumors to therapy .
PEPTIDES
Section::::Peptides .
Peptides are able to cross the blood – brain barrier ( BBB ) through various mechanisms , opening new diagnostic and therapeutic avenues .
However , their BBB transport data are scattered in the literature over different disciplines , using different methodologies reporting different influx or efflux aspects .
Therefore , a comprehensive BBB peptide database ( Brainpeps ) was constructed to collect the BBB data available in the literature .
Brainpeps currently contains BBB transport information with positive as well as negative results .
The database is a useful tool to prioritize peptide choices for evaluating different BBB responses or studying quantitative structure - property ( BBB behaviour ) relationships of peptides .
Because a multitude of methods have been used to assess the BBB behaviour of compounds , we classified these methods and their responses .
Moreover , the relationships between the different BBB transport methods have been clarified and visualized .
Casomorphin is a heptapeptide and could be able to pass the BBB .
DISEASE
MENINGITIS Section::::Disease .
Section::::Meningitis .
Meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord ( these membranes are known as meninges ) .
Meningitis is most commonly caused by infections with various pathogens , examples of which are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae .
When the meninges are inflamed , the blood – brain barrier may be disrupted .
This disruption may increase the penetration of various substances ( including either toxins or antibiotics ) into the brain .
Antibiotics used to treat meningitis may aggravate the inflammatory response of the central nervous system by releasing neurotoxins from the cell walls of bacteria - like lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .
Depending on the causative pathogen , whether it is bacterial , fungal , or protozoan , treatment with third - generation or fourth - generation cephalosporin or amphotericin B is usually prescribed .
BRAIN ABSCESS
Section::::Brain abscess .
A brain or cerebral abscess , like other abscesses , is caused by inflammation and collection of lymphatic cells and infected material originating from a local or remote infection .
A brain abscess is a rare , life - threatening condition .
Local sources may include infections of the ear , the oral cavity and teeth , the paranasal sinuses , or an epidural abscess .
Remote sources may include infections in the lung , heart or kidney .
A brain abscess may also be caused by head trauma or as a complication of surgery .
In children cerebral abscesses are usually linked to congenital heart disease .
In most cases , 8–12 weeks of antibacterial therapy is required .
EPILEPSY Section::::Epilepsy .
Epilepsy is a common neurological disease that is characterized by recurrent and sometimes untreatable seizures .
Several clinical and experimental data have implicated the failure of blood – brain barrier function in triggering chronic or acute seizures .
Some studies implicate the interactions between a common blood protein ( albumin ) and astrocytes .
These findings suggest that acute seizures are a predictable consequence of disruption of the BBB by either artificial or inflammatory mechanisms .
In addition , expression of drug resistance molecules and transporters at the BBB are a significant mechanism of resistance to commonly used anti - epileptic drugs .
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Section::::Multiple sclerosis .
Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) is considered to be an auto - immune and neurodegenerative disorder in which the immune system attacks the myelin that protects and electrically insulates the neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems .
Normally , a person 's nervous system would be inaccessible to the white blood cells due to the blood – brain barrier .
However , magnetic resonance imaging has shown that when a person is undergoing an MS " attack , " the blood – brain barrier has broken down in a section of the brain or spinal cord , allowing white blood cells called T lymphocytes to cross over and attack the myelin .
It has sometimes been suggested that , rather than being a disease of the immune system , MS is a disease of the blood – brain barrier .
The weakening of the blood – brain barrier may be a result of a disturbance in the endothelial cells on the inside of the blood vessel , due to which the production of the protein P - glycoprotein is not working well .
There are currently active investigations into treatments for a compromised blood – brain barrier .
It is believed that oxidative stress plays an important role into the breakdown of the barrier .
Anti - oxidants such as lipoic acid may be able to stabilize a weakening blood – brain barrier .
NEUROMYELITIS OPTICA Section::::Neuromyelitis optica .
Neuromyelitis optica , also known as Devic 's disease , is similar to and is often confused with multiple sclerosis .
Among other differences from MS , a different target of the autoimmune response has been identified .
Patients with neuromyelitis optica have high levels of antibodies against a protein called aquaporin 4 ( a component of the astrocytic foot processes in the blood – brain barrier ) .
LATE - STAGE NEUROLOGICAL TRYPANOSOMIASIS ( SLEEPING SICKNESS ) Section::::Late - stage neurological trypanosomiasis ( sleeping sickness ) .
Late - stage neurological trypanosomiasis , or sleeping sickness , is a condition in which trypanosoma protozoa are found in brain tissue .
It is not yet known how the parasites infect the brain from the blood , but it is suspected that they cross through the choroid plexus , a circumventricular organ .
PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY ( PML )
Section::::Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) .
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that is caused by reactivation of a latent papovavirus ( the JC polyomavirus ) infection , that can cross the BBB .
It affects immune - compromised patients and it is usually seen with patients suffering from AIDS .
DE VIVO DISEASE Section::::De Vivo disease .
De Vivo disease ( also known as GLUT1 deficiency syndrome ) is a rare condition caused by inadequate transportation of the sugar glucose across the blood – brain barrier , resulting in developmental delays and other neurological problems .
Genetic defects in glucose transporter type 1
( GLUT1 ) appears to be the primary cause of De Vivo disease .
ALZHEIMER 'S
DISEASE Section::::Alzheimer 's disease .
Some evidence indicates that disruption of the blood – brain barrier in Alzheimer 's disease patients allows blood plasma containing amyloid beta ( Aβ ) to enter the brain where the Aβ adheres preferentially to the surface of astrocytes .
These findings have led to the hypotheses that ( 1 ) breakdown of the blood – brain barrier allows access of neuron - binding autoantibodies and soluble exogenous Aβ42 to brain neurons and ( 2 ) binding of these autoantibodies to neurons triggers and/or facilitates the internalization and accumulation of cell surface - bound Aβ42 in vulnerable neurons through their natural tendency to clear surface - bound autoantibodies via endocytosis .
Eventually the astrocyte is overwhelmed , dies , ruptures , and disintegrates , leaving behind the insoluble Aβ42 plaque .
Thus , in some patients , Alzheimer 's disease may be caused ( or more likely , aggravated ) by a breakdown in the blood – brain barrier .
CEREBRAL EDEMA
Section::::Cerebral edema .
Cerebral edema is the accumulation of excess water in the extracellular space of the brain , which can result when hypoxia causes the blood – brain barrier to open .
PRION AND PRION - LIKE DISEASES Section::::Prion and prion - like diseases .
Many neurodegenerative diseases including synucleinopathies such as Parkinson 's , and tauopathies such as Alzheimer 's are thought to result from seeded misfolding from pathological extracellular protein variants known as prions .
This prion - like hypothesis is gaining support in numerous studies in vitro and involving in vivo intracerebral injection of brain lysates , extracted protein ( tau , alpha - synuclein ) and synthetically generated fibers in alpha - synucleinopathies .
These proteins are also detectable in increasing amounts in the plasma of patients suffering from these conditions ( particularly total alpha - synuclein in Parkinson 's disease patients ) .
The extent to which and the mechanisms by which these prion - like proteins can penetrate the blood – brain barrier is currently unknown .
HIV ENCEPHALITIS Section::::HIV encephalitis .
It is believed that latent HIV can cross the blood – brain barrier inside circulating monocytes in the bloodstream ( " Trojan horse theory " )
within the first 14 days of infection .
Once inside , these monocytes become activated and are transformed into macrophages .
Activated macrophages release virions into the brain tissue proximate to brain microvessels .
These viral particles likely attract the attention of sentinel brain microglia and perivascular macrophages initiating an inflammatory cascade that may cause a series of intracellular signaling in brain microvascular endothelial cells and damage the functional and structural integrity of the BBB .
This inflammation is HIV encephalitis ( HIVE ) .
Instances of HIVE probably occur throughout the course of AIDS and are a precursor for HIV - associated dementia ( HAD ) .
The premier model for studying HIV and HIVE is the simian model .
RABIES Section::::Rabies .
During lethal rabies infection of mice , the blood – brain barrier ( BBB ) does not allow anti - viral immune cells to enter the brain , the primary site of rabies virus replication .
This aspect contributes to the pathogenicity of the virus and artificially increasing BBB permeability promotes viral clearance .
Opening the BBB during rabies infection has been suggested as a possible novel approach to treating the disease , even though no attempts have yet been made to determine whether or not this treatment could be successful .
SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION Section::::Systemic inflammation .
Inflammation in the body may lead to effects on the brain via the blood – brain barrier .
During systemic inflammation , whether in the form of infection or sterile inflammation , the BBB may undergo changes which may be disruptive or non - disruptive .
Such changes may be part of a productive host response to systemic inflammation , or may lead to deleterious consequences within the central nervous system .
These BBB changes likely play a role in the generation of sickness behaviour during systemic infection .
These changes may also induce or accelerate disease within the brain , for example in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer 's disease , and may be part of the reason why patients with these conditions can deteriorate during an infection .
Also , in patients with neurological disease the BBB may be abnormally sensitive to the effects of systemic inflammation .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Paul Ehrlich was a bacteriologist studying staining , a procedure that is used in many microscopy studies to make fine biological structures visible using chemical dyes .
As Ehrlich injected some of these dyes ( notably the aniline dyes that were then widely used ) , the dye stained all of the organs of some kinds of animals except for their brains .
At that time , Ehrlich attributed this lack of staining to the brain simply not picking up as much of the dye .
However , in a later experiment in 1913 , ( one of Ehrlich 's students ) injected the dye directly into the cerebrospinal fluids of animal brains .
He found then the brains did become dyed , but the rest of the body did not , demonstrating the existence of a compartmentalization between the two .
At that time , it was thought that the blood vessels themselves were responsible for the barrier , since no obvious membrane could be found .
The concept of the blood – brain barrier ( then termed hematoencephalic barrier ) was proposed by a Berlin physician , Lewandowsky , in 1900 .
