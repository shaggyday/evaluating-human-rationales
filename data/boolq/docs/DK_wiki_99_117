This statement aptly describes Bridget 's pursuit of Eric , despite the fact that relationships between the coaches and the campers are forbidden .
She flirts with Eric and shows off for him during games .
When Bridget 's turn with the Traveling Pants finally comes , she puts them on that night and walks around outside Eric 's cabin , leading him to the beach .
