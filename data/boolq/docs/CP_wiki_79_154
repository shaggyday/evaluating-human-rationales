CARRYING ( BASKETBALL )
Carrying , also colloquially referred to as palming , is a violation in the game of basketball .
It occurs when the dribbling player continues to dribble after allowing the ball to come to rest in one or both hands .
Carrying is similar to a double dribble because the player momentarily stops dribbling and then resumes dribbling .
If the player is in motion while carrying the ball , then it is similar to traveling ( 3 + steps ) .
Players can avoid a carrying violation by keeping their palms facing the floor while dribbling .
Most basketball players slide their hand to one side of the ball when dribbling to better control the ball , directing it from left to right and vice versa .
So long as the ball does not come to rest , not only this is legal , but it also allows more control and easier ball - handling .
The problem arises when the ball - handler slides their hand too far down the side of the ball and has their hand below it .
A carrying violation is called once the player 's hand is below the ball 's plane of 90 Â° and the ball 's motion significantly stops .
