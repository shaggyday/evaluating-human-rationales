ATTORNEY GENERAL
In most common law jurisdictions , the attorney general or attorney - general ( sometimes abbreviated AG ) is the main legal advisor to the government .
The plural is attorneys general ( traditional ) or attorney generals .
In some jurisdictions , attorneys general also have executive responsibility for law enforcement , prosecutions or even responsibility for legal affairs generally .
In practice , the extent to which the attorney general personally provides legal advice to the government varies between jurisdictions , and even between individual office - holders within the same jurisdiction , often depending on the level and nature of the office - holder 's prior legal experience .
Where the attorney general has ministerial responsibility for legal affairs in general ( as is the case , for example , with the United States Attorney General or the Attorney - General for Australia , and the respective attorneys general of the states in each country ) , the ministerial portfolio is largely equivalent to that of a Minister of Justice in some other countries .
The term was originally used to refer to any person who holds a general power of attorney to represent a principal in all matters .
In the common law tradition , anyone who represents the state , especially in criminal prosecutions , is such an attorney .
Although a government may designate some official as the permanent attorney general , anyone who came to represent the state in the same way could , in the past , be referred to as such , even if only for a particular case .
Today , however , in most jurisdictions , the term is largely reserved as a title of the permanently appointed attorney general of the state , sovereign or other member of the royal family .
Civil law jurisdictions have similar offices , which may be variously called " public prosecutor general " , " procurators " , " advocates general " , " public attorneys " , and other titles .
Many of these offices also use " attorney general " or " attorney - general " as the English translation of the title , although because of different historical provenance , the nature of such offices is usually different from that of attorneys - general in common law jurisdictions .
ETYMOLOGY Section::::Etymology .
In regard to the etymology of the phrase Attorney General , Steven Pinker writes that the earliest citation in the Oxford English Dictionary is from 1292 : " Tous attorneyz general purrount lever fins et cirrographer "
( All general attorneys may levy fines and make legal documents ) .
The phrase was borrowed from Anglo - Norman French when England was ruled by Normans after the conquest of England in the 11th - century .
As a variety of French , which was spoken in the law courts , schools , universities and in sections of the gentry and the bourgeoisie , the term relating to government got introduced into English .
The phrase attorney general is composed of a noun followed by the postpositive adjective general and as other French compounds its plural form also appears as " attorneys generals " .
As compared to major generals , a term that also originates from French ( " " ) and also has a postpositive adjective , it also appears as " attorney generals " .
Steven Pinker writes : " So if you are ever challenged for saying attorney - generals , mother - in - laws , passerbys ... you can reply , ' They are the very model of the modern major general .

NETHERLANDS
Section::::Netherlands .
In the Netherlands , there are two types of attorneys - general , that are only historically related .
The first type of attorney - general ( " advocaat - generaal " in Dutch ) is the public prosecutor in criminal cases at appellate courts .
The second type of attorney - general ( " procureur - generaal " , while their replacements are called " advocaat - generaal " ) is an independent advisor to the Supreme Court .
These people give an opinion on cases ( called " conclusies " ) in any field of law ( not just criminal law ) , supported by a scientific staff .
The Supreme Court may either follow or reject the opinion of the attorney - general ( which is published together with the eventual decision ) .
In a way , an attorney - general acts as yet another judge , but in the Dutch system that does not allow dissenting opinions to be published , it is the only way to reflect different perceptions on a case .
The Procureur - Generaal also prosecutes members of parliament in the case of misfeance .
Dutch attorneys - general do not normally advise the government .
