LOUIS BLUES
The St. Louis Blues are a professional ice hockey team in St. Louis , Missouri .
They are members of the Central Division of the Western Conference of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) .
The Blues play their home games at the 19,150-seat Enterprise Center in downtown St. Louis .
Enterprise Center is the second home arena of the Blues , with the team first playing at St. Louis Arena from 1967 to 1994 .
The team is named after the famous W. C. Handy song " Saint Louis Blues " .
The franchise was founded in 1967 as an expansion team during the league 's 1967 NHL Expansion , which expanded the NHL from 6 teams to 12 .
The Blues are the oldest active NHL team never to have won the Stanley Cup , although they played in the Stanley Cup Finals three times , in 1968 , 1969 and 1970 .
The Blues share a rivalry with the Chicago Blackhawks , contesting the same division since 1970 .
The team has two minor league affiliates : the San Antonio Rampage of the American Hockey League ( AHL ) and the Tulsa Oilers of the ECHL .
FRANCHISE HISTORY
BEGINNINGS AND STANLEY CUP FINALS ' APPEARANCES ( 1967–1970 ) Section::::Franchise history .
Section::::Beginnings and Stanley Cup Finals ' appearances ( 1967–1970 ) .
The Blues were one of the six teams added to the NHL in the 1967 expansion , along with the Minnesota North Stars , Los Angeles Kings , Philadelphia Flyers , Pittsburgh Penguins and California Seals .
St. Louis was the last of the six expansion teams to gain entry into the League , chosen over Baltimore at the insistence of the Chicago Black Hawks .
The Black Hawks were owned by the influential Wirtz family of Chicago , which also owned the decrepit St. Louis Arena .
The Wirtzes sought to unload the arena , which had not been well - maintained since the 1940s , and thus pressed the NHL to give the franchise to St. Louis , which had not submitted a formal expansion bid .
NHL president Clarence Campbell said during the 1967 expansion meetings that , " We want a team in St. Louis because of the city 's geographical location and the fact that it has an adequate building . "
The team 's first owners were insurance tycoon Sid Salomon Jr. , his son , Sid Salomon III , and Robert L. Wolfson , who were granted the franchise in 1966 .
Sid Salomon III convinced his initially wary father to make a bid for the team .
Former St. Louis Cardinals great Stan Musial and Musial 's business partner
Julius " Biggie " Garagnani were also members of the 16-man investment group that made the initial formal application for the franchise .
Garagnani would never see the Blues franchise take the ice , as he died from a heart attack on June 19 , 1967 , less than three months before the Blues played their first preseason game .
Upon acquiring the franchise in 1966 , Salomon then spent several million dollars on extensive renovations for the 38-year - old arena , which increased the number of seats from 12,000 to 15,000 .
The Blues were originally coached by Lynn Patrick , who resigned in late November after recording a 4–13–2 record .
He was replaced by assistant coach Scotty Bowman , who thereafter led the team to a winning record for the rest of the season .
Although the League 's rules effectively kept star players with the original six teams , the Blues managed to stand out in the inferior Western Division .
Capitalizing on a playoff format that required an expansion team to make it to the Stanley Cup Finals , the Blues reached the Stanley Cup Finals in each of their first three seasons , though they were swept first by the Montreal Canadiens in 1968 and 1969 , then by the Boston Bruins in 1970 .
While the first Blues teams included aging and fading veterans like Doug Harvey , Don McKenney and Dickie Moore , the goaltending tandem of veterans Glenn Hall and Jacques Plante proved more durable , winning a Vezina Trophy in 1969 behind a sterling defense that featured players like skilled defensive forward Jim Roberts , team captain Al Arbour and hardrock brothers
Bob and Barclay Plager .
Phil Goyette won the Lady Byng Trophy for the Blues in 1970 and New York Rangers castoff Red Berenson became the expansion team 's first major star at center .
The arena quickly became one of the loudest buildings in the NHL , a reputation it maintained throughout its tenure as the Blues ' home .
During that time , Salomon gained a reputation throughout the NHL as the top players ' owner .
He gave his players cars , signed them to deferred contracts and treated them to vacations in Florida .
The players , used to being treated like mere commodities , felt the only way they could pay him back was to give their best on the ice every night .
FINANCIAL PROBLEMS , NEAR - RELOCATION , AND PLAYOFF STREAK (
1970–1987 )
Section::::Financial problems , near - relocation , and playoff streak ( 1970–1987 ) .
The Blues ' successes in the late 1960s , however , did not continue into the 1970s , as the Stanley Cup playoff format changed and the Chicago Black Hawks were moved into the Western Division .
The Blues lost Bowman , who joined the Montreal Canadiens following a power - sharing dispute with Sid Salomon III ( who was taking an increasing role in team affairs ) , as well as Hall , Plante , Goyette and ultimately Berenson , who were all lost to retirement or trade .
The Berenson trade , however , did bring then - Detroit Red Wings star center Garry Unger , who ultimately scored 30 goals in eight consecutive seasons while breaking the NHL 's consecutive games played record .
Defensively , however , the Blues were less than stellar and saw Chicago and the Philadelphia Flyers overtake the Division .
After missing the playoffs for the first time in 1973–74 , the Blues ended up in the Smythe Division after a League realignment .
This division was particularly weak , and in 1976–77 , the Blues won it while finishing five games below .500 , though this would be their last playoff appearance in the decade .
In the meantime , the franchise was on the brink of financial collapse .
This was partly due to the pressures of the World Hockey Association ( WHA ) , but mostly the result of financial decisions made when the Salomons first acquired the franchise .
Deferred contracts came due just as the Blues ' performance began to slip .
At one point , the Salomons cut the team 's staff down to three employees .
One of them was Emile Francis , who served as team president , general manager and head coach , who convinced then - chairman R. Hal Dean of the St. Louis - based pet food giant Ralston Purina to buy the team , arena and the $ 8.8 million debt .
The Salomons followed suit as they sold the team to that company on July 27 , 1977 .
However , Ralston said that this was only temporary until they found a stable owner in St. Louis .
Ralston renamed the arena the " Checkerdome . "
After two awful years including finishing with a franchise low 18–50–12 record with 48 points ( still the worst season in franchise history ) in 1979 , the Blues made the playoffs the following year , the first of 25 consecutive postseason appearances .
After being one of the worst teams a couple years ago , they were one of the best in 1981 , as they finished with a then franchise best record of 45–18–17 record which translated to 107 points and the second - best record in the League .
10 players reached at least 20 goals including Wayne Babych , future Hall of Famer Bernie Federko , and team captain Brian Sutter .
They also had strong goal tending led by Mike Liut .
As of the result , they would get rewarded as Red Berenson won the Jack Adams Award , Mike Liut finished a close second to Wayne Gretzky in the Hart Trophy voting , and earned the top spot on the NHL All - Star Team , Larry Patey finished third in the Frank J. Selke Trophy voting , and Blake Dunlop won the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy .
Their regular season success , however , did not transfer into the playoffs , as they were eliminated by the New York Rangers in the second round 2–4 after beating the Pittsburgh Penguins in the first round 3–2 .
The Blues would underachieve greatly the following year as they posted a 32–40–8 but they beat the Winnipeg Jets 3–1 in the Norris Division Semi - Finals before dropping to the Chicago Black Hawks in the Norris Division 2–4 .
While the Blues were somewhat succeeding on - ice , they were struggling off the ice , as Purina lost an estimated $ 1.8 million a year during its six - year ownership of the Blues , but took the losses philosophically , having taken over out of a sense of civic responsibility .
In 1981 , Purina 's longtime chairman , R. Hal Dean , retired .
His successor , William Stiritz , wanted to refocus on the core pet food business , and had no interest in hockey .
He saw the Blues as just another money - bleeding division , and put the team on the market and although companies were interested in buying the team and made plans , they did not have the cash to do it .
On January 12 , 1983 , Batoni - Hunter Enterprises , Ltd led by WHA and Edmonton Oilers founder Bill Hunter would make an offer purchase as he had a $ 43 million 18,000 seat stadium ready for the 1984 season in Saskatoon , Saskatchewan .
While the fan base was stunned , the players were aware of this as there were being dealt brochures on December 7 , 1982 as the Blues faced the Oilers that said " Saskatchewan in the NHL " .
These distractions would greatly affect their performance as they entered to the playoffs with a 25–40–15 record in the 1983 season , good enough for 65 points .
This led to a Norris Division semi - finals exit against the Chicago Black Hawks .
Following their playoff exit , Ralston authorized the deal to Hunter 's renamed company Coliseum Holdings , Ltd for $ 12 million on April 21st .
Emile Francis would call it quits on May 2 as he left for the Hartford Whalers to become president and general manager .
The Blues then managed to fire 60 % of its organization .
The remaining staff included the accounting department , scouting staff and coach Barclay Plager .
They waited for an authorization by 75 % of the NHL Board of Governors for the sale and transfer of the club .
However , the NHL Board of Governors rejected the deal by a 15–3 vote on May 18 .
The NHL felt that the market was too small and it would not be financially stable .
Ralston would then file a $ 60 million anti - trust lawsuit in US District Court against the NHL .
They claimed that they broke federal anti - trust laws and breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing by voting to reject the sale and transfer of the Blues to Coliseum Holdings ,
Ltd. They also requested to the court that they do not continue operating the team and the defendants to interfere with the sale of the team .
On June 3 , Ralston announced that they had no interest in running the team anymore .
Because they were not required to participate in the 1983 NHL Entry Draft they did not send a representative , which led the Blues to forfeiting their picks .
The following day after the draft , the NHL would file a $ 78 million counter - suit against Ralston , accusing that " damaging the league by willfully , wantonly and maliciously collapsing its St. Louis Blues hockey operation . "
NHL also said that Ralston broke a league rule that an owner had to give two years notice before dissolving a franchise .
Ralston called the counter - suit " ridiculous " and threatened the league that if they did not accept the offer by June 14 , they would disestablish the team and sell off players and assets to other teams .
The Board of Governors would reject the offer and " terminated " the team on June 13 one day before Ralston 's supposed deadline , which the league took over control of the franchise and began searching for a new owner as Then - NHL president John Ziegler said they would try to keep the team in St. Louis .
But , the league had a deadline , that if no owner was found by August 6 , they would disestablish the team by holding a special player draft .
On July 27 , 1983 , ten days before the deadline , the NHL would approve the purchase of Harry Ornest and a group of St. Louis - based investors for the team and the arena , who was making plans in late - March to buy the team , and he built up his efforts in late June to have enough money .
Ornest immediately reverted the name of the team 's home to the St. Louis Arena .
Ornest ran the Blues on a shoestring budget , though the players did not mind .
According to Sutter , they wanted to stay in St. Louis because it reminded them of the rural Canadian towns where many of them grew up .
For instance , Ornest asked many players to defer their salaries to help meet operating costs , but the players always got paid in the end .
During most of his tenure , the Blues had only 26 players under contract – 23 in St. Louis , plus three on their farm team , the Montana Magic .
Most NHL teams during the mid-1980s had over 60 players under contract .
Despite being run on the cheap , the Blues remained competitive even though they never finished more than six games over .500 in Ornest 's three years as owner .
During this time , Doug Gilmour , drafted by St. Louis in 1982 , emerged as a star .
While the Blues remained competitive , they were unable to keep many of their young players .
More often than not , several of the Blues ' emerging stars ended up as Calgary Flames , and the sight of Flames executive Al MacNeil was always greeted with dread .
In fact , several of the Blues ' young stars , such as Rob Ramage , Joe Mullen and Gilmour , were main cogs in the Flames ' 1989 Stanley Cup win .
Sutter and Federko were the only untouchables on the Blues .
By 1986 , the team reached the Campbell Conference Finals against the Flames .
Doug Wickenheiser 's overtime goal in Game 6 to cap a furious comeback remains one of the greatest moments in team history ( known locally as the " Monday Night Miracle " ) , but the Blues lost Game 7 , 2–1 .
After that season , Ornest sold the team to a group led by St. Louis businessman Michael Shanahan .
BRETT HULL ERA ( 1988–1998 )
Section::::Brett Hull era ( 1988–1998 ) .
St. Louis kept chugging along through the late 1980s and early 1990s .
General manager Ron Caron made astute moves , landing forwards
Brett Hull , Adam Oates and Brendan Shanahan , defenseman Al MacInnis and goaltender Curtis Joseph , among others .
While the Blues contended during this time period , they never passed the second round of the playoffs .
Nonetheless , their on - ice success was enough for a consortium of 19 companies to buy the team .
They also provided the capital to build the Kiel Center ( now the Enterprise Center ) , which opened in 1994 .
Hull , nicknamed the " Golden Brett " ( a reference to his father , NHL legend Bobby Hull , who was nicknamed the " Golden Jet " ) , became one of the League 's top stars and a scoring sensation , netting 86 goals in 1990–91 en route to earning the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league 's most valuable player .
Hull 's 86 goals set the record for most goals in a single season by a right - winger ( and the third - most overall at the time ) .
Only Wayne Gretzky found the net more than Hull during any given three - year period .
Despite posting the second - best regular season record in the entire league in 1990–91 , the Blues were upset in the second round of the playoffs to the Minnesota North Stars , a defeat that was symbolic of St. Louis ' playoff struggles .
Mike Keenan was hired as both general manager and coach prior to the abbreviated 1995 season , with the hope that he could cure the postseason turmoil Blues fans had endured for years .
Keenan instituted major changes , including trades that sent away fan favorites Brendan Shanahan and Curtis Joseph , as well as the acquisition of the legendary - but - aging Wayne Gretzky and goaltender Grant Fuhr , both from the declining Los Angeles Kings ( due to public criticism from Keenan , Gretzky left for the New York Rangers as an unrestricted free agent following the season , in spite of a more lucrative contract offer from the Blues ) .
In spite of all he was prophesied to accomplish , Keenan 's playoff resume with St. Louis included a first - round exit in 1995 and a second - round exit in 1996 , and he was subsequently fired on December 19 , 1996 .
Caron was reinstated as interim general manager for the rest of season , and general manager Larry Pleau was hired on June 9 , 1997 .
However , this did not stop Hull , who had a lengthy feud with Keenan , from leaving for the Dallas Stars in 1998 .
He went on to win the Stanley Cup with the Stars the next year , scoring a controversial goal on the Buffalo Sabres ' Dominik Hasek to clinch the Cup for Dallas .
By the time the decade ended , the Blues were the only NHL team to make the playoffs in all ten years of the 90s .
END OF THE PLAYOFF STREAK , LOCKOUT , AND REBUILD ( 1998–2011 ) Section::::End of the playoff streak , lockout , and rebuild ( 1998–2011 ) .
Defenseman Chris Pronger ( acquired from the Hartford Whalers in 1995 for Brendan Shanahan , Keith Tkachuk , Pavol Demitra , Pierre Turgeon , Al MacInnis and goaltender Roman Turek kept the Blues a contender in the NHL .
In 1999–2000 , the team notched a franchise - record 114 points during the regular season , earning the Presidents ' Trophy for the League 's best record .
However , they were stunned by the San Jose Sharks in the first round of the 2000 playoffs in seven games .
In 2001 , the Blues advanced to the Western Conference Finals before bowing out in five games to the eventual champions , the Colorado Avalanche .
Nonetheless , the team remained competitive for the next three years , despite never reaching past the second round in the playoffs .
Despite years of mediocrity and the stigma of never being able to " take the next step , " the Blues were a playoff presence every year from 1980 to 2004 – the third longest streak in North American professional sports history ( all three of which being held by NHL teams ) , but they never won Stanley Cup Championships , nor made a finals appearances .
In fact , they made it to the conference finals only two times in their streak ( 1986 and 2001 ) .
Amid several questionable personnel moves and an unstable ownership situation , the Blues finished the 2005–06 season with their worst record in 27 years .
They missed the playoffs for only the fourth time in franchise history .
Moreover , for the first time in club history , the normally excellent support seen by St. Louisans began to fade away , with crowds normally numbering around 12,000 , a far cry from the team 's normal high ( about 18,000 in a 19,500 seat arena ) .
Wal - Mart heir Nancy Walton Laurie and her husband Bill purchased the Blues in 1999 .
On June 17 , 2005 , the Lauries announced that they would sell the team .
Bill Laurie , a former point guard at Memphis State University , had long desired to buy and move a National Basketball Association ( NBA ) team to St. Louis ( coming close to achieving this in 1999 , with an unsuccessful attempt to purchase the then - Vancouver Grizzlies ) , and it was thought that this desire caused him to neglect the Blues .
On September 29 , 2005 , it was announced that the Lauries had signed an agreement to sell the Blues to SCP Worldwide , a consulting and investment group headed by former Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts .
On November 14 , 2005 , the Blues announced that SCP Worldwide had officially withdrawn from negotiations to buy the team .
On December 27 , 2005 , it was announced that the Blues had signed a letter of intent to exclusively negotiate with General Sports and Entertainment , LLC .
However , after the period of exclusivity , SCP entered the picture again .
On March 24 , 2006 , the Lauries completed the sale of the Blues and the lease to the Savvis Center to SCP and TowerBrook Capital Partners , L.P. , a private equity firm .
The Blues are currently the only team in the four major North American sports ( ice hockey , basketball , baseball , and American football ) to be owned by a private equity firm .
Following the disappointing 2005–06 season , which saw the Blues with the worst record in the NHL , the new management focused on rebuilding the franchise .
Under new management , the Blues promptly installed John Davidson as president of hockey operations , moving Pleau to a mostly advisory role .
The former New York Rangers goaltender promptly made multiple blockbuster deals , picking up Jay McKee , Bill Guerin and Manny Legace from free agency , and bringing Doug Weight back to St. Louis after a brief ( and productive ) stopover in Carolina .
Weight was again traded in December 2007 to the Anaheim Ducks , along with a minor league player , in exchange for Andy McDonald .
At the beginning of the 2006–07 season , the Blues looked to be competitive in the Central Division .
However , injuries plagued the team all season , and the lack of a bona fide scorer hampered them as well .
Fan support was sluggish during the first half of the campaign , and the end of the calendar year was capped by an 11-game losing streak .
On December 11 , 2006 , the Blues fired Head coach Mike Kitchen and replaced him with former Los Angeles Kings head coach Andy Murray .
Davidson also installed a strong development program under Head Scout Jarmo Kekalainen , using the team 's raft of high draft picks in 2006 and 2007 to select highly touted prospects such as T. J. Oshie , Erik Johnson and David Perron .
On January 4 , 2007 , the Blues had a record of 6–1–3 in their previous ten games , which was the best in the NHL during that stretch .
Despite a healthy 24-point jump from the previous season , the strain of playing in a conference where seven teams finished with more than 100 points kept them out of the playoffs for the second year in a row .
Immediately prior to the 2007 NHL trade deadline , the Blues traded several key players , including as Bill Guerin , Keith Tkachuk and Dennis Wideman , in exchange for draft picks , though they later re - signed Tkachuk during the subsequent off - season .
Brad Boyes , picked up from the Boston Bruins in exchange for Wideman , became the fastest Blues player to reach 40 goals since Brett Hull , doing so during the 2007–08 season .
During the 2007 off - season , the Blues signed free agent Paul Kariya to a three - year contract worth $ 18 million , re - signed defenseman Barret Jackman to a one - year contract , lost their captain Dallas Drake to the Detroit Red Wings , and traded prospect Carl Soderberg to the Bruins in exchange for yet more depth in the goal crease , Hannu Toivonen .
On October 2 , 2007 , the Blues finalized the season - starting roster , which included rookies David Perron , Steven Wagner and Erik Johnson .
On October 10 , 2007 , the Blues introduced a new mascot , Louie .
Two months later , they traded Doug Weight , a 38-year - old four - time All - Star center , to the Anaheim Ducks as part of a package to acquire 30-year - old center Andy McDonald .
On February 8 , 2008 , it was announced that , after going much of the season without a captain , defenseman Eric Brewer was chosen as the team 's 19th captain .
The team later traded veteran defenseman Bryce Salvador to the New Jersey Devils for enforcer , and St. Louis native , Cam Janssen .
He made his debut two days later , wearing number 55 against the Phoenix Coyotes .
After spending the first half of the 2008–09 season at or near the bottom of the Western Conference standings , the Blues began to turn things around behind the solid goaltending of Chris Mason .
After a strong second half run , the Blues made the 2009 playoffs on April 10 , 2009 , after defeating the Columbus Blue Jackets 3–1 .
On April 12 , the Blues clinched the sixth seed in the West with a 1–0 win against the Colorado Avalanche .
For the first time in five years ( that is , since the lockout ) , the Blues were in the playoffs .
They faced the third - seeded Vancouver Canucks in the first round , but despite the team 's tremendous run to end the season , the Blues would ultimately lose the series in a quick four - game sweep .
The Blues fired head coach Andy Murray on January 2 , 2010 , after a disappointing record ( 17–17–6 , 40 points ) , sitting in 12th place in the Conference .
Especially galling were the frequent blown leads after two periods , and with the worst home record ( 6–13–3 ) posted in the entire NHL .
After his duties as interim coach for the rest of the 2009–10 season , Davis Payne was named the 23rd head coach in the Blues ' history on April 14 .
Payne was previously the head coach of the Blues top minor league affiliate , the Peoria Rivermen of the American Hockey League ( AHL ) .
TURNING POINT ( 2011–PRESENT )
Section::::Turning point ( 2011–present ) .
On March 17 , 2011 , it was announced that the St. Louis Blues were for sale .
During the 2011 NHL off - season , the team signed many key free agents , including Brian Elliott , Scott Nichol , Kent Huskins , Jason Arnott and Jamie Langenbrunner .
They fired their head coach , Davis Payne , and named Ken Hitchcock as his replacement on November 6 , 2011 .
David Backes was also announced as the new team captain .
On March 17 , 2012 , the Blues became the first team to reach 100 points and clinch a playoff berth in the 2011–12 season under Hitchcock , qualifying for their first playoffs since 2008–09 .
They would finish second in the Western Conference , behind the Vancouver Canucks .
During the 2012 playoffs , they won their first playoff series since 2002 , eliminating the San Jose Sharks in five games .
The Blues were swept by the eventual Stanley Cup champions , the Los Angeles Kings , in the following round .
In 2012–13 , the Blues completed the lockout - shortened season in fourth place in the Western Conference .
They were again eliminated by Los Angeles , however , this time in six games in the first round of the playoffs , despite taking an initial 2–0 series lead .
The following season , 2013–14 , the team hit the 100-point mark for the sixth time in franchise history , and gained a franchise record of 52 wins .
Their chance on winning the Central Division title , the top seed in the West , and the Presidents ' Trophy would all evaporate , after they lost their final six games and wound up in second place in the Division , this time to the Colorado Avalanche .
The slump haunted them , as they blew a 2–0 series lead to the defending champion Chicago Blackhawks , losing the first round series in six games .
This marked the second - straight year the Blues lost in the first round of the playoffs to the reigning champions in six games after leading the series 2–0 .
In 2014–15 , the Blues won their second Central Division championship in four years and faced the Minnesota Wild in round one of the 2015 playoffs .
However , for the third - straight year , they lost in the first round and in six games .
During the off - season , forward T. J. Oshie was traded to the Washington Capitals in exchange for Troy Brouwer .
In 2015–16 , the Blues finished in second place in the Central Division to the Dallas Stars .
The Blues took on the defending champion Chicago Blackhawks in the first round series .
The Blues jumped to a 3–1 series lead , but struggled in games 5 and 6 .
However , St. Louis ended their first round losing streak by beating Chicago 3–2 in game 7 of the series .
The moved on to the next round , where they defeated the Dallas Stars in another seven - game series to advance to their first Western Conference Final since 2001 .
The Blues season would come to an end at the hands of the San Jose Sharks , who eliminated them in six games .
On June 13 , 2016 , it was announced that Mike Yeo would replace Hitchcock as head coach of the Blues following the 2016–17 season .
The 2016 off - season saw big changes for the Blues , as team captain David Backes left the team to sign with the Boston Bruins , and goaltender Brian Elliott was traded to the Calgary Flames , while veteran forward Troy Brouwer also signed with Calgary as a free agent .
Steve Ott also left the team , signing a free agent deal with the Red Wings .
Jake Allen was now the starting goaltender for the Blues , while the team also signed former Nashville Predators backup Carter Hutton .
Former Blues forward David Perron was brought back on a free agent deal , while defenseman Alex Pietrangelo was named team captain .
The team started the season by posting a record of 10–1–2 in their first 13 home games .
However , they only won three games on the road during the first two months of the season .
Despite defeating the Blackhawks in the 2017 NHL Winter Classic by the score of 4–1 , the Blues fired Hitchcock and promoted Yeo to head coach on February 1 , 2017 .
Despite an impressive run into the end of the season , when they gained most points in the league from February 1 , when Hitchcock was fired , to the end of the season , the Blues were eliminated in the second round by the Nashville Predators in six games .
In the off - season for the 2017–18 season , the Blues would lose David Perron to the Vegas Golden Knights via Expansion Draft .
They would also pick up Brayden Schenn from the Philadelphia Flyers by giving away Jori Lehtera .
Before the season began , the Blues were hit hard with injuries as they lost Robby Fabbri before the season began .
Other players like Patrik Berglund , and Alex Steen did not return for the season in time .
Despite these losses , the Blues raced out to a 21–8–2 start in their first 31 games .
The Blues lost more players as Jay Bouwmeester suffered a season ending injury , and Jaden Schwartz missed a large portion of the season .
The Blues also dealt away Paul Stastny to the Winnipeg Jets at the trade deadline for their 1st round pick as they won only 23 games of their remaining 51 , but they still had a chance to get into the playoffs on the last day of their season against the Colorado Avalanche .
After losing Vladimir Tarasenko to injury during the game , the Blues lost to the Avalanche 5–2 as they missed the playoffs for the first time in seven years .
During the 2018 NHL off - season , the Blues acquired forwards Ryan O'Reilly from the Buffalo Sabres and Pat Maroon from the New Jersey Devils .
On November 19 , 2018 , the Blues fired head coach Yeo and replaced him with Craig Berube on an interim basis .

Buck elected to leave the booth after one season , though , and was replaced by another famed announcer in Dan Kelly .
This setup — Kelly as commentator , with either Kyle , Bob Plager or Noel Picard ( whose heavy French - Canadian accent became famous , such as pronouncing owner Sid Salomon III
"
Sid the Turd " instead of " Third " ) joining as an analyst , simulcast on KMOX and KPLR — continued through the 1975–76 season , then simulcast on KMOX and KDNL - TV for the next three seasons .
KMOX is a 50,000-watt clear - channel station that reaches almost all of North America at night , allowing Kelly to become a celebrity in both the United States and Canada .
Indeed , many of the Blues ' players liked the fact that their families could hear the games on KMOX .
From 1979 to 1981 , the radio and television broadcasts were separated for the first time since the inaugural season , with Kelly doing the radio broadcasts and Eli Gold hired to do the television .
Following the 1980–81 season , the television broadcasts moved from KDNL to NBC affiliate KSD - TV for the 1981–82 season , produced by Sports Network Incorporated ( SNI ) , owned and operated by Greg Maracek who did the broadcasts with Channel 5 sportscaster Ron Jacober .
The broadcasts failed to produce a profit and then returned to KPLR for the 1982 NHL playoffs and the 1982–83 season before returning to KDNL ( currently St. Louis ' ABC affiliate ) for the 1983–84 season , the first under the ownership of Harry Ornest .
The Blues skated back to KPLR three years later .
In 1985 , Ornest , wanting more broadcast revenue , put the radio rights up for bid .
A new company who had purchased KXOK won the bid for a three - year contract and Kelly moved over from KMOX to do the games on KXOK .
However , the station was never financially competitive in the market .
Additionally , fans complained they could not hear the station at night
( it had to readjust its coverage due to a glut of clear - channels on adjacent frequencies ) .
KXOK backed out of the contract after just two years , and the Blues immediately went back to KMOX , who held the rights until 2000 .
Dan Kelly continued to broadcast the games on radio but was diagnosed in the summer of 1988 with lung cancer and died on February 10 , 1989 .
After his death , Ron Jacober ( who had left Channel 5 to be KXOK 's sports director in 1985 then left for KMOX in 1987 ) finished the season as the radio play - by - play announcer and was succeeded in that position by John Kelly .
Ken Wilson continued the television broadcasts after Kelly 's death with former Blues ' players Joe Micheletti and Bruce Affleck .
During this time , from 1989 to 2000 , more games began to be aired on Prime Sports Midwest , the forerunner to today 's Fox Sports Midwest ( branded FSBLUES in games ) .
The long - term partnership between KMOX and the Blues had its problems , however , namely during spring when the ever - popular St. Louis Cardinals began their season .
Blues games , many of which were crucial to playoff berths , would often be pre - empted for spring training coverage .
Angry at having to play " second fiddle " , the Blues elected to leave for KTRS in 2000 .
However , in an ironic twist the Cards purchased a controlling interest in KTRS in 2005 , and once again preferred to air preseason baseball over regular season hockey .
In response , the Blues moved back to KMOX starting in the 2006–07 season .
The season of 2008–09 saw the Blues play their last game on KPLR , which had the rights since the 1986–87 season ( except for the 1996–97 season on CBS affiliate KMOV ) , electing to move all their games to FS Midwest , starting with the 2009–10 season .
The Cardinals moved back to KMOX in the 2011 season , with conflicting games moved to KYKY , an FM station owned by the same group as KMOX : under the current radio agreement , KYKY will be the flagship station for all Blues playoff games up until the conference finals , with games from then on being aired on KMOX .
Currently , Chris Kerber and Joe Vitale are the radio broadcast team .
John Kelly ( son of Dan ) and Darren Pang handle television coverage , along with Bernie Federko ( on - ice analyst ) and Scott Warmann , Terry Yake and Jamie Rivers ( pre - game and post - game shows ) .
TRADITIONS Section::::Traditions .
The Blues have a tradition of live organ music .
Jeremy Boyer , the Blues organist , plays a Glenn Miller arrangement of W. C. Handy 's " St. Louis Blues " in its entirety before games and a short version at the end of every period , followed by " When the Saints Go Marching In . "
Boyer also plays the latter song on the organ after Blues goals , with fans replacing the word " Saints " with " Blues . "
At the end of the national anthem before every home game , the words " the home of the brave " are drowned out by fans with " the home of the Blues . "
Starting in 2014 , the team introduced a win song in the form of Pitbull 's " Do n't Stop The Party " , but from 2016 on , the win song has been " Song 2 " by Blur after public backlash against using a Pitbull song .
The Blues were one of the last teams to add a goal horn , doing so during the 1992–93 season at the St. Louis Arena .
All of these traditions carried over to the Kiel Center ( now known as Enterprise Center ) in 1994 .
After each goal , a bell is rung and each of the goals are counted by the crowd .
Since 1990 , Ron Baechle , also known as the " Towel Man " or " Towel Guy , " has celebrated each goal by counting with the bell and throwing a towel into the crowd from section 314 .
The team also has a long tradition of fan - produced programs , sold outside the arena and providing an often biting , sarcastic , humor - filled alternative to team- and League - produced periodicals .
The longest - running fan publication , Game Night Revue , was created by a group of fans in the mold of the Chicago Blackhawks ' Blue Line Magazine .
It operated for over 10 years , from 1994 to 2005 , when its owner decided not to resume the magazine after the 2004–05 NHL lockout ( one final oversized " goodbye " issue was distributed the first two home games of the 2005–06 season ) .
After hockey resumed in 2005 , a few months after GNR 's final issue , a new publication , St. Louis Game Time , was formed by several former GNR staffers .
