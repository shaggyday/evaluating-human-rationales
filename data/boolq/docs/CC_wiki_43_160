COURSE CREDIT
A credit is the recognition for having taken a course at school or university , used as measure if enough hours have been made for graduation .
UNIVERSITY CREDITS UNITED STATES CREDIT HOURS Section::::University credits .

Section::::Credit hours .
In a college or university in the United States , students generally receive credit hours based on the number of " contact hours " per week in class , for one term ; more well known as Semester Credit Hours .
A contact hour includes any lecture or lab time when the professor is teaching the student or coaching the student while they apply the course information to an activity .
Regardless of the duration of the course ( i.e. a short semester like summer or intersession ) and depending on the state or jurisdiction , a semester credit hour ( SCH ) is 15 - 16 contact hours per semester .
Most college and university courses are 3 Semester Credit Hours ( SCH ) or 45 - 48 contact hours , so they usually meet for three hours per week over a 15-week semester .
Homework is time the student spends applying the class material without supervision of the professor : this includes studying notes , supplementary reading , writing papers , or other unsupervised activities such as labwork or field work .
Because students are generally expected to spend three hours outside class studying and doing homework for every hour spent in class , 15 SCH is the typical full course load , although many colleges consider 12 SCH a minimum full - time load for financial aid and other purposes .
Some schools set a flat rate for full - time students , such that a student taking over 12 or 15 credit hours will pay the same amount as a student taking exactly 12 ( or 15 ) .
A part - time student taking less than 12 hours pays per credit hour , on top of matriculation and student fees .
Credit for laboratory and studio courses as well as physical education courses , internships and practica is usually less than for lectures - typically one credit for every two to three hours spent in lab or studio , depending on the amount of actual instruction necessary prior to lab .
However , for some field experiences such as student teaching as a requirement for earning one 's teaching license , a student may only earn 8 - 10 credits for the semester for doing 40 hours a week of work .
To figure a grade - point average ( GPA ) , the grade received in each course is subject to weighting , by multiplying it by the number of credit hours .
Thus , a " B " ( three grade points ) in a four - credit class yields 12 " quality points " .
It is these which are added together , then divided by the total number of credits a student has taken , to get the GPA .
Transfer credits are not necessarily counted in the GPA .
Some courses may require a grade higher than that which is considered passing .
In this case , a grade of " D " will still add to the total number of credits earned ( unlike an " F " ) Various types of student aid and certain student visas require students to take and complete a minimum number of course credits each term .
Schools often require a minimum number or percentage of credits be taken at the school to qualify for a diploma from that school â€” this is known as a residency requirement .
CREDIT BY EXAMINATION Section::::Credit by examination .
Credit by examination , also known as credit by exam , is a way of receiving course credit without taking the course .
This grade often shows as a " K " on a transcript , however it carries no credit hours , and therefore has no effect on the GPA .
This also means that a student often must take other classes instead , to meet minimum hour requirements .
This still benefits the student , because he or she can learn something new and useful , instead of repeating what is already known .
DANTES and College Level Examination Program ( CLEP ) are two programs that offer college bound students credit by examination .
FACULTY HOURS Section::::Faculty hours .
Faculty in comprehensive or baccalaureate colleges and universities typically have 12 SCH per semester .
Faculty teaching significant graduate work or large classes ( 100 or more students in a section ) may have " load lifts " or " course reductions .
" Faculty at research universities typically have an official teaching load of 12 SCH per semester , but their actual load is reduced because of the requirement for significant peer reviewed published research .
While faculty workloads are almost universally based on the number of SCH taught , faculty teaching in technical " clock hour " programs in technical and community colleges have workloads that more closely resemble high school teaching , so that Faculty in community colleges typically teach 15 SCH or more per semester ( 5 days per week at 3 hours per day ) .
CANADA Section::::Canada .
In Canada , the term college often refers to a community college or trade school , whilst the more formal and inclusive term for post - high school education is post - secondary education .
Most university courses run from September to April with 13 weeks before Christmas and 13 weeks after .
Classes that meet three hours a week are generally awarded 6 credit hours .
3rd and 4th year classes are more specialized so some facilities may offer half courses that run from September to December or January to April .
These courses are awarded 3 credit hours .
In some provinces , such as Ontario , a different system is used .
The school year is often broken into two semesters .
A single semester class is worth 1/2 a credit , and a full year course is worth a full credit .
A normal class load consists of five to six classes a semester , which leads to five - six credits being accumulated each school year .
BRAZIL AND URUGUAY Section::::Brazil and Uruguay .
There is no unified academic credit system in Brazil .
The regulating bodies of the Ministry of Education and the legislation count the hours of instruction .
A full - time year of higher education takes between 800 and 1200 instruction - hours in Brazil , which would be equivalent to 30 US credits and 60 European ECTS .
In Uruguay 's University of the Republic , a credit stands for 15 hours of work , including classes , personally studying and task activities .
Since semesters last 15 weeks , a credit corresponds to one hour of work a week .
INDIA Section::::India .
In India , most engineering colleges follow the course credit system .
The number of ' Contact Hours ' in a week of a particular course determines its credit value .
Typically , courses vary from 2 to 5 credits .
The GPA is calculated on a 10-point scale , with weighted average of the grades received in the respective course .
The grades awarded are ; A+ , A , B+ , B , C+ , C , D and E(Fail ) .
This GPA is also known as CGPA ( Cumulative Grade Point Average ) .
The thesis submitted at the end of the four - year degree is generally given 20 credits .
On an average , students in India need to complete 195 - 200 credits after their 4-year engineering course to be awarded the degree B.Tech / B.E. with a summer internship ( 6 weeks minimum ) & a one - year - long thesis project .
A new CBCS ( Choice Based Credit System )
scoring system was devised by UGC for undergraduate students from the academic year 2016 - 17 .
The system provides an opportunity for students to pick courses from core , elective or skill - based courses .
EUROPE Section::::Europe .
In Europe , a common credit system has been introduced .
The European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System ( ECTS ) is in some European countries used as the principal credit and grading system in universities , while other countries use the ECTS as a secondary credit system for exchange students .
In ECTS , a full study year normally consists of 60 credits .
ECTS grades are given in the A - E range , where F is failing .
Schools are also allowed to use a pass / fail evaluation in the ECTS system .
UNITED KINGDOM Section::::United Kingdom .
In the United Kingdom , the common credit system is the Credit Accumulation and Transfer Scheme ( CATS ) .
A full study year normally consists of 120 CATS credits and grades are usually recorded as percentages ( i.e. 0 - 100 ) .
Most UK Universities also use the European ECTS system in addition to CATS .
HIGH SCHOOL CREDITS UNITED STATES Section::::High school credits .
Section::::United States .
In high schools in the United States , where all courses are usually the same number of hours , often meeting every day , students earn one credit for a course that lasts all year , or a half credit per course per semester .
This credit is formally known as a Carnegie Unit .
After a typical four - year run , the student needs 26 credits to graduate ( an average of 6 to 7 at any time ) .
Some high schools have only three years of school because 9th grade is part of their middle schools , with 18 to 21 credits required .
CANADA Section::::Canada .
In Canada , credits can be earned at the end of a course in high school .
Earning a credit depends whether a person passes the course or not .
A certain number of credits are required to graduate high school .
A minimum of 30 credits are needed in order to graduate in specifically Ontario , those being 18 compulsory credits and 12 elective credits .
1 credit is equal to 1 completed course per semester , with the maximum credits earned per semester being 4 - 5 .
Each school year is separated into 2 semesters , or 4 terms ; while it takes 1 semester for 1 credit , there are two compulsory courses taken in Grade 10 that each take up 1 term , earning half a credit upon completion , adding up to 1 credit , and being considered as one course that has merely been separated .
The course credit system is similar to the one used in the United States .
