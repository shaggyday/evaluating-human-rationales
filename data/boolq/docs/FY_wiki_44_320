BLACK DEATH IN ENGLAND
The Black Death was a bubonic plague pandemic , which reached England in June 1348 .
It was the first and most severe manifestation of the Second Pandemic , caused by Yersinia pestis bacteria .
The term " Black Death " was not used until the late 17th century .
Originating in China , it spread west along the trade routes across Europe and arrived on the British Isles from the English province of Gascony .
The plague seems to have been spread by flea - infected rats , as well as individuals who had been infected on the continent .
Rats were the reservoir hosts of the Y. pestis bacteria and the Oriental rat flea was the primary vector .
The first known case in England was a seaman who arrived at Weymouth , Dorset , from Gascony in June 1348 .
By autumn , the plague had reached London , and by summer 1349 it covered the entire country , before dying down by December .
Low estimates of mortality in the early twentieth century have been revised upwards due to re - examination of data and new information , and a figure of 40–60 percent of the population is widely accepted .
The English government handled the crisis well , and the country did not experience the extreme reactions that were seen elsewhere in Europe .
The most immediate consequence was a halt to the campaigns of the Hundred Years ' War .
In the long term , the decrease in population caused a shortage of labour , with subsequent rise in wages , resisted by the landowners , which caused deep resentment among the lower classes .
The Peasants ' Revolt of 1381 was largely a result of this resentment , and even though the rebellion was suppressed , in the long term serfdom was ended in England .
The Black Death also affected artistic and cultural efforts , and may have helped advance the use of the vernacular .
In 1361–62 the plague returned to England , this time causing the death of around 20 percent of the population .
After this the plague continued to return intermittently throughout the 14th and 15th centuries , in local or national outbreaks .
From this point on its effect became less severe , and one of the last outbreaks of the plague in England was the Great Plague of London in 1665–66 .
BACKGROUND
ENGLAND IN THE MID-14TH CENTURY Section::::Background .
Section::::England in the mid-14th century .
It is impossible to establish with any certainty the exact number of inhabitants in England at the eve of the Black Death , and estimates range from 3 to 7 million .
The number is probably in the higher end , and an estimate of around 6 million inhabitants seems likely .
Earlier demographic crises − in particular the Great Famine of 1315–1317 − had resulted in great numbers of deaths , but there is no evidence of any significant decrease in the population prior to 1348 .
England was still a predominantly rural and agrarian society ; close to 90 percent of the population lived on the countryside .
Of the major cities , London was in a class of its own , with perhaps as many as 70,000 inhabitants .
Further down the scale were Norwich , with around 12,000 people , and York with around 10,000 .
The main export , and the source of the nation 's wealth , was wool .
Until the middle of the century the export had consisted primarily of raw wool to cloth makers in Flanders .
Gradually though , the technology for cloth making used on the Continent was appropriated by English manufacturers , who started an export of cloths around mid - century that would boom over the following decades .
Politically , the kingdom was evolving into a major European power , through the youthful and energetic kingship of Edward III .
In 1346 , the English had won a decisive battle over the Scots at the Battle of Neville 's Cross , and it seemed that Edward III would realise his grandfather Edward
I 's ambition of bringing the Scots under the suzerainty of the English crown .
The English were also experiencing military success on the continent .
Less than two months before the Battle of Neville 's Cross , a numerically inferior English army led by the king himself won a spectacular victory over the French royal forces at the Battle of Crécy .
The victory was immediately followed by Edward laying siege to the port city of Calais .
When the city fell the next year , this provided the English with a strategically important enclave that would remain in their possession for over two centuries .
THE BLACK DEATH Section::::The Black Death .
The term " Black Death " which refers to the first and most serious outbreak of the Second Pandemic was not used by contemporaries , who preferred such names as the " Great Pestilence " or the " Great Mortality " .
It was not until the 17th century that the term under which we know the outbreak today became common , probably derived from Scandinavian languages .
It is generally agreed today that the disease in question was plague , caused by Yersinia pestis bacteria .
These bacteria are carried by fleas , which can be transferred to humans through contact with rats .
Flea bites carry the disease into the lymphatic system , through which it makes its way to the lymph nodes .
Here the bacteria multiply and form swellings called buboes , from which the term bubonic plague is derived .
After three or four days the bacteria enter the bloodstream , and infect organs such as the spleen and the lungs .
The patient will then normally die after a few days .
A different strain of the disease is pneumonic plague , where the bacteria become airborne and enter directly into the patient 's lungs .
This strain is far more virulent , as it spreads directly from person to person .
These types of infection probably both played a significant part in the Black Death , while a third strain was more rare .
This is the septicaemic plague , where the flea bite carries the bacteria directly into the blood stream , and death occurs very rapidly .
A study reported in 2011 of skeletons exhumed from the Black Death cemetery in East Smithfield London found Yersinia pestis DNA .
An archaeological dig in the vicinity of Thornton Abbey in Lincolnshire was reported in the science section of The Guardian for November 30 , 2016 ,
not only confirming evidence of the Y. pestis DNA in the human remains exhumed there but also dating the remains to mid-1349 .
Genotyping showed that it was [ at that time ] a newly evolved strain , ancestor of all modern strains and proved the Black Death was bubonic plague .
Modern medical knowledge suggests that because it was a new strain , the human immune system would have had little or no defence against it , helping to explain the plague 's virulence and high death rates .
The Black Death seems to have originated in Central Asia , where the Y. pestis bacterium is endemic in the rodent population .
It is unknown exactly what caused the outbreak , but a series of natural occurrences likely brought humans into contact with the infected rodents .
The epidemic reached Constantinople in the late spring of 1347 , through Genoese merchants trading in the Black Sea .
From here it reached Sicily in October that same year , and by early 1348 it had spread over the entire Italian mainland .
It spread rapidly through France , and had reached as far north as Paris by June 1348 .
Moving simultaneously westward , it arrived in the English province of Gascony around the same time .
PROGRESS OF THE PLAGUE Section::::Progress of the plague .
According to the chronicle of the grey friars at King 's Lynn , the plague arrived by ship from Gascony to Melcombe in Dorset today normally referred to as Weymouth shortly before the Feast of St. John The Baptist on 24 June 1348 .
Other sources mention different points of arrival , including Bristol and Southampton .
Though the plague might have arrived independently at Bristol at a later point , the Grey Friars ' Chronicle is considered the most authoritative account .
If it is assumed that the chronicle reports the first outbreak of the plague , rather than its actual arrival , then the arrival most likely happened around 8 May. From Weymouth
the disease spread rapidly across the south - west .
The first major city to be struck was Bristol .
The disease reached London in the autumn of 1348 , before most of the surrounding countryside .
This had certainly happened by November , though according to some accounts as early as 29 September .
Arrival in London happened by three principal roads : overland from Weymouth through Salisbury and Winchester overland from Gloucester , and along the coast by ship .
The full effect of the plague was felt in the capital early the next year .
Conditions in London were ideal for the plague : the streets were narrow and flowing with sewage , and houses were overcrowded and poorly ventilated .
By March 1349 the disease was spreading haphazardly across all of southern England .
During the first half of 1349 the Black Death spread northwards .
A second front opened up when the plague arrived by ship at the Humber , after which it spread both south and north .
In May it reached York , and during the summer months of June , July and August , it ravaged the north .
Certain northern counties , like Durham and Cumberland , had been the victim of violent incursions from the Scots , and were therefore left particularly vulnerable to the devastations of the plague .
Pestilence is less virulent during the winter months , and spreads less rapidly .
The Black Death in England had survived the winter of 1348–49 , but during the following winter it gave in , and by December 1349 conditions were returning to relative normalcy .
It had taken the disease approximately 500 days to traverse the entire country .
MEDICAL PRACTICE Section::::Medical practice .
Various methods were used including sweating , bloodletting , forced vomiting , and urinating to treat patients infected with the plague .
Several symptoms of the illness included blotches , hardening of the glands under the groin and underarms , and dementia .
Within the initial phase of the disease , bloodletting was performed on the same side of where the physical manifestations of the buboes or risings appeared .
For instance , if a rising appeared on the right side of the groin the physician would bleed a vein in the ankle on the same side .
In the case of sweating , it was achieved with such medicines as Mithridate , Venice - Treacle , Matthiolus , Bezoar - Water , Serpentary Roots and Electuarium de Ovo .
Sweating was used when measures were desperate ; if a patient had tokens , a severe version of risings , the physician would wrap the naked patient in a blanket drenched in cold water .
This measure was only performed while the patient still had natural heat in his system .
The desired effect was to make the patient sweat violently and thus purge all corruption from the blood which was caused by the disease .
Another practice was the use of pigeons when treating swellings .
Swellings which were white in appearance and deep were unlikely to break and were anointed with Oil of Lillies or Camomil .
Once the swelling rose to a head and was red in appearance and not deep in the flesh , it was broken with the use of a feather from a young pigeon 's tail .
The feather 's fundament was held to the swelling and would draw out the venom .
However , if the swelling dropped and became black in appearance , the physician had to be cautious when drawing the cold from the swelling .
If it was too late to prevent , the physician would take the young pigeon , cut it open from breast to back , break it open and apply the pigeon ( while still alive ) over the cold swelling .
The cupping therapy was an alternative method which was heated and then placed over the swellings .
Once the sore was broken , the physician would apply Mellilot Plaister with Linimentum Arcei and heal the sore with digence .
VICTIMS DEATH TOLL Section::::Victims .
Section::::Death toll .
Although historical records for England were more extensive than those of any other European country , it is still extremely difficult to establish the death toll with any degree of certainty .
Difficulties involve uncertainty about the size of the total population , as described above , but also issues regarding the proportion of the population that died from the plague .
Contemporary accounts are often grossly inflated , stating numbers as high as 90 percent .
Modern historians give estimates of death rates ranging from around 25 percent to more than 60 percent of the total population .
The pioneering work in the field was made by Josiah William Russell in his 1948 British Medieval Population .
Russell looked at inquisitions post mortem ( IPMs ) taken by the crown to assess the wealth of the greatest landowners after their death to assess the mortality caused by the Black Death , and from this arrived at an estimate of 23.6 percent of the entire population .
He also looked at episcopal registers for the death toll among the clergy , where the result was between 30–40 percent .
Russell believed the clergy was at particular risk of contagion , and eventually concluded with a low mortality level of only 20 percent .
Several of Russell 's assumptions have been challenged , and the tendency since has been to adjust the assessment upwards .
Philip Ziegler , in 1969 , estimated the death rate to be at around one third of the population .
Jeremy Goldberg , in 1996 , believed a number closer to 45 percent would be more realistic .
A 2004 study by Ole Jørgen Benedictow suggests the exceptionally high mortality level of 62.5 percent .
Assuming a population of 6 million , this estimate would correspond to 3,750,000 deaths .
Such a high percentage would place England above the average that Benedictow estimates for Western Europe as a whole , of 60 percent .
A death rate at such a high level has not been universally accepted in the historical community .
In 2016 , Carenza Lewis reported the results of a new method of assessing the death toll .
She argued that pottery before and after the Black Death is datable because there was a change at that time from the high medieval to the late medieval style , and that counts of pottery of each type therefore provide a useful proxy for long term changes in population .
She and her colleagues analysed pottery sherds from test pits in more than 50 continuously occupied rural settlements in eastern England , and found a decline in the number of pottery producing pits of 45 percent .
Norfolk had the greatest drop of 65 percent , while there was no drop in 10 percent of settlements , mostly commercial centres .
IMPACT OF THE BLACK DEATH : 1349 Section::::Impact of the Black Death : 1349 .
Archbishop Zouche of York issued a warning throughout the diocese in July 1348 ( when the epidemic was raging further south ) of ' great mortalities , pestilences and infections of the air ' .
The Great Mortality , as it was then known , entered Yorkshire around February 1349 and quickly spread through the diocese .
The clergy were on the front line of the disease , bringing comfort to the dying , hearing final confessions and organising burials .
This , almost by necessity , put them at a greater risk of infection .
Estimates suggest that the death rate of clergy in some parts of the archdiocese could have been as high as 48 percent .
This is reflected in the Ordination Register , which shows a massive rise in ordained clergy over the period – some being recruited before the arrival of plague in a clerical recruitment drive , but many once plague had arrived , replacing those who had been killed .
The nation 's population decreased by a third causing a labour shortage and giving the lower class negotiating power against their overlords .
In 1346 , 111 priests and 337 acolytes were recruited .
In 1349 , 299 priests and 683 acolytes are named , with 166 priests being ordained in one session alone in February 1350 . "
SOCIAL DISTRIBUTION Section::::Social distribution .
Russell trusted the IPMs to give a true picture of the national average , because he assumed death rates to be relatively equal across the social spectrum .
This assumption has later been proven wrong , and studies of peasant plague mortality from manor rolls have returned much higher rates .
This could be a consequence of the elite 's ability to avoid infection by escaping plague - infected areas .
It could also result from lower post - infection mortality among those more affluent , due to better access to care and nursing .
If so , this would also mean that the mortality rates for the clergy who were normally better off than the general population were no higher than the average .
The manorial records offer a good opportunity to study the geographical distribution of the plague .
Its effect seems to have been about the same all over England , though a place like East Anglia , which had frequent contact with the Continent , was severely affected .
On a local level , however , there were great variations .
A study of the Bishop of Worcester 's estates reveal that , while his manors of Hartlebury and Hambury had a mortality of only 19 percent , the manor of Aston lost as much as 80 percent of its population .
The manor rolls are less useful for studying the demographic distribution of the mortality , since the rolls only record the heads of households , normally an adult male .
Here the IPMs show us that the most vulnerable to the disease were infants and the elderly .
There seem to have been very few victims of the Black Death at higher levels of society .
The only member of the royal family who can be said with any certainty to have died from the Black Death was in France at the time of her infection .
Edward III 's daughter Joan was residing in Bordeaux on her way to marry Pedro of Castile in the summer of 1348 .
When the plague broke out in her household she was moved to a small village nearby , but she could not avoid infection , and died there on 2 September .
It is possible that the popular religious author Richard Rolle , who died on 30 September 1349 , was another victim of the Black Death .
The English philosopher William of Ockham has been mentioned as a plague victim .
This , however , is an impossibility .
Ockham was living in Munich at the time of his death , on 10 April 1347 , two years before the Black Death reached that city .
CONSEQUENCES ECONOMIC , SOCIAL AND POLITICAL EFFECTS
Section::::Consequences .
Section::::Economic , social and political effects .
Among the most immediate consequences of the Black Death in England was a shortage of farm labour , and a corresponding rise in wages .
The medieval world - view was unable to interpret these changes in terms of socio - economic development , and it became common to blame degrading morals instead .
The landowning classes saw the rise in wage levels as a sign of social upheaval and insubordination , and reacted with coercion .
In 1349 , King Edward III passed the Ordinance of Labourers , fixing wages at pre - plague levels .
The ordinance was reinforced by Parliament 's passing of the Statute of Labourers in 1351 .
The labour laws were enforced with ruthless determination over the following decades .
These legislative measures proved largely inefficient at regulating the market , but the government 's repressive measures to enforce them caused public resentment .
These conditions were contributing factors to the Peasants ' Revolt in 1381 .
The revolt started in Kent and Essex in late May , and once the rebels reached London they burnt down John of Gaunt 's Savoy Palace , and killed both the Chancellor and the Treasurer .
They then demanded the complete abolition of serfdom , and were not pacified until the young King Richard II personally intervened .
The rebellion was eventually suppressed , but the social changes it promoted were already irreversible .
By around 1400 serfdom was virtually extinct in England , replaced by the form of tenure called copyhold .
It is conspicuous how well the English government handled the crisis of the mid - fourteenth century , without descending into chaos and total collapse in the manner of the Valois government of France .
To a large extent this was the accomplishment of administrators such as Treasurer William de Shareshull and Chief Justice William Edington , whose highly competent leadership guided the governance of the nation through the crisis .
The plague 's greatest effect on the government was probably in the field of war , where no major campaigns were launched in France until 1355 .
Another notable consequence of the Black Death was the raising of the real wage of England ( due to the shortage of labour as a result of the reduction in population ) , a trait shared across Western Europe , which in general led to a real wage in 1450 that was unmatched in most countries until the 19th or 20th century .
The higher wages for workers combined with sinking prices on grain products led to a problematic economic situation for the gentry .
As a result , they started to show an increased interest for offices like justice of the peace , sheriff and member of parliament .
The gentry took advantage of their new positions and a more systematic corruption than before spread .
A result of this was that the gentry as a group became highly disliked by commoners .
RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL CONSEQUENCES Section::::Religious and cultural consequences .
The omnipresence of death also inspired greater piety in the upper classes , which can be seen in the fact that three Cambridge colleges were founded during or shortly after the Black Death .
England did not experience the same trend of roving bands of flagellants , common on the continent .
Neither were there any pogroms against the Jews , since the Jews had been expelled by Edward I in 1290 .
In the long run , however , the increase in public participation may have served to challenge the absolute authority of the church hierarchy , and thus possibly helped pave the way for the Protestant Reformation .
The high rate of mortality among the clergy naturally led to a shortage of priests in many parts of the country .
The clergy were seen to have an elevated status among ordinary people and this was partly due to their closeness with God , being his envoys on earth .
However , as the church itself had given the cause of the Black Death to be the impropriety of the behaviour of men , the higher death rate among the clergy led the people to lose faith in the Church as an institution − it had proved as ineffectual against the horror of Y. pestis as every other medieval institution .
The corruption within the Catholic priesthood also angered the English people .
Many priests abandoned the terrified people .
Others sought benefits from the rich families who needed burials .
The dissatisfaction led to anti - clericalism and the rise of John Wycliffe , an English priest .
His ideas paved a path for the Christian reformation in England .
Some people did n't lose their Christian faith , if anything it was renewed ; they began to long for a more personal relationship with God − around the time after the Black Death many chantries ( private chapels ) began to spread in use from not just the nobility , but to among the well to do .
This change in the power of the papacy in England is demonstrated by the statutes of Praemunire .
The Black Death also affected arts and culture significantly .
It was inevitable that a catastrophe of such proportions would affect some of the greater building projects , as the amount of available labour fell sharply .
The building of the cathedrals of Ely and Exeter was temporarily halted in the years immediately following the first outbreak of the plague .
The shortage of labour also helped advance the transition from the Decorated style of building to the less elaborate Perpendicular style .
The Black Death may also have promoted the use of vernacular English , as the number of teachers proficient in French dwindled , contributing to the late 14th century flowering of English literature , represented by writers such as Geoffrey Chaucer and John Gower .
RECURRENCES Section::::Recurrences .
The Black Death was the first occurrence of the Second Pandemic , which continued to strike England and the rest of Europe more or less regularly until the 18th century .
The first serious recurrence in England came in the years 1361−62 .
Little is known about the death rates caused by these later outbreaks , but the so - called pestis secunda may have had a mortality of around 20 percent .
This epidemic was also particularly devastating for the population 's ability to recover , since it disproportionately affected infants and young men .
This was also the case with the next occurrence , in 1369 , where the death rate was around 10−15 percent .
Over the following decades the plague would return on a national or a regional level at intervals of five to 12 years , with gradually dwindling death tolls .
Then , in the decades from 1430 to 1480 , the disease returned in force .
An outbreak in 1471 took as much as 10–15 percent of the population , while the death rate of the plague of 1479–80 could have been as high as 20 percent .
From that point outbreaks became fewer and more manageable , due largely to conscious efforts by central and local governments from the late 15th century onward to curtail the disease .
By the 17th century the Second Pandemic was over .
One of its last occurrences in England was the famous Great Plague of London in 1665–66 .
