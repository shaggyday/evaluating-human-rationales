The hold is not an official Major League Baseball statistic .
DESCRIPTION Section::::Description .
Unlike saves , wins , and losses , more than one pitcher per team can earn a hold for a game , though it is not possible for a pitcher to receive more than one hold in a given game .
A pitcher can receive a hold by protecting a lead even if that lead is lost by a later pitcher after his exit .
The hold was invented in by John Dewan and Mike O'Donnell to give a statistical measure of the effectiveness of the vast majority of relief pitchers who are afforded few opportunities to close a game .
While middle relievers earn their share , holds are most often credited to setup pitchers .
In 1994 , PA SportsTicker created an alternate definition for a hold , removing the requirement that a pitcher needs to make an out in order to record a hold .
In 2009 , STATS LLC purchased PA SportsTicker , and the alternate definition is no longer in use .
While holds are not an official MLB statistic , they are increasingly visible in many box scores , including espn.com and MLB.com .
Many fantasy baseball providers also include holds as an optional category which can be included in customized leagues .
