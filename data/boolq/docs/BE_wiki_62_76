SLAVE STATES AND FREE STATES
In the history of the United States , a slave state was a U.S. state in which the practice of slavery was legal , and a free state was one in which slavery was prohibited or being legally phased out .
Historically , in the 17th century , slavery was established in a number of English overseas possessions .
In the 18th century , it existed in all the British colonies of North America .
In the Thirteen Colonies , the distinction between slave and free states began during the American Revolutionary War ( 1775–1783 ) .
Slavery became a divisive issue and was the primary cause of the American Civil War .
The Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , ratified in 1865 , abolished slavery throughout the United States , and the distinction between free and slave states ended .
EARLY HISTORY
Section::::Early history .
Historically , slavery in Eastern North America in the 17th and 18th century began in the English colonies .
Slavery in the colonial US was established in each of the Thirteen Colonies .
During British colonization , the number of people in slavery expanded , primarily drawn from the Atlantic slave trade .
Organized political and social movements to end slavery began in the mid-18th century .
The sentiments of the American Revolution ( 1775 - 1783 ) and the equality evoked by the Declaration of Independence stood in contrast to the status of most black Americans .
Despite this , thousands of black Americans fought against the British in hopes of a new order .
Thousands also joined the British army , encouraged by British offers of freedom in exchange for military service .
( See Black Patriot and Black Loyalist ) .
In the 1770s , blacks throughout New England began sending petitions to northern legislatures demanding freedom .
Five of the Northern self - declared states adopted policies to at least gradually abolish slavery : Pennsylvania ( 1780 ) , New Hampshire and Massachusetts ( 1783 ) , Connecticut and Rhode Island ( 1784 ) .
Vermont had abolished slavery in 1777 , while it was still independent , and when it joined the United States as the 14th state in 1791 , it was the first state to join untainted by slavery .
These state jurisdictions thus enacted the first abolition laws in the Americas .
By 1804 ( including , New York ( 1799 ) , New Jersey ( 1804 ) ) , all of the northern states had abolished slavery or set measures in place to gradually abolish it .
In the south , Kentucky was created a slave state from Virginia ( 1792 ) , and Tennessee was created a slave state from North Carolina ( 1796 ) .
By 1804 , before the creation of new states from the federal western territories , the number of slave and free states was eight each .
In popular usage , the geographic divide between the slave and free states was called the Mason - Dixon line ( between Maryland and Pennsylvania or Delaware ) .
The 1787 , United States Constitutional Convention debated slavery , and for a time slavery was a major impediment to passage of the new constitution .
As a compromise , the institution was acknowledged though never mentioned directly in the constitution , as in the case of the Fugitive Slave Clause .
In 1808 , the United States outlawed the international slave import trade , but the domestic trade in half the states continued .
NEW TERRITORIES Section::::New territories .
The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 , passed just before the U.S. Constitution was ratified , had prohibited slavery in the federal Northwest Territory .
The southern boundary of the territory was the Ohio River , which was regarded as a westward extension of the Mason - Dixon line .
The territory was generally settled by New Englanders and American Revolutionary War veterans granted land there .
The 6 states created from the territory were all free states : Ohio ( 1803 ) , Indiana ( 1816 ) , Illinois ( 1818 ) , Michigan ( 1837 ) , Wisconsin ( 1848 ) , and Minnesota ( 1858 ) .
During the War of 1812 , the British accepted as free all slaves who came into their hands , with no conditions as to military service such as had been made in Dunmore 's Proclamation in the Revolutionary War .
By the end of the War of 1812 , the momentum for antislavery reform , state by state , appeared to run out of steam , with half of the states having already abolished slavery ( Northeast ) , prohibited from the start ( Midwest ) or committed to eliminating slavery , and half committed to continuing the institution indefinitely ( South ) .
The potential for political conflict over slavery at a federal level made politicians concerned about the balance of power in the United States Senate , where each State was represented by two Senators .
With an equal number of slave states and free states , the Senate was equally divided on issues important to the South .
As the population of the free states began to outstrip the population of the slave states , leading to control of the House of Representatives by free states , the Senate became the preoccupation of slave - state politicians interested in maintaining a Congressional veto over federal policy in regard to slavery and other issues important to the South .
As a result of this preoccupation , slave states and free states were often admitted into the Union in opposite pairs to maintain the existing Senate balance between slave and free states .
MISSOURI COMPROMISE Section::::Missouri Compromise .
Controversy over whether Missouri should be admitted as a slave state resulted in the Missouri Compromise of 1820 , which specified that Louisiana Purchase territory north of latitude 36 ° 30 ' , which described most of Missouri 's southern boundary , would be organized as free states and territory south of that line would be reserved for organization as slave states .
As part of the compromise , the admission of Maine ( 1820 ) as a free state was secured to balance Missouri 's admission as a slave state ( 1820 ) .
TEXAS AND THE MEXICAN CESSION Section::::Texas and the Mexican Cession .
The admission of Texas ( 1845 ) and the acquisition of the vast new Mexican Cession territories ( 1848 ) , after the Mexican – American War , created further North - South conflict .
Although the settled portion of Texas was an area rich in cotton plantations and dependent on slave labor , the territory acquired in the Mountain West did not seem hospitable to cotton or slavery .
As part of the Compromise of 1850 , California was admitted as a free state ( 1850 ) , without a slave state pair .
To avoid creating a free state majority in the Senate , California agreed to send one pro - slavery and one anti - slavery senator to Congress .
LAST BATTLES Section::::Last battles .
The difficulty of identifying territory that could be organized into additional slave states stalled the process of opening the western territories to settlement , while slave state politicians sought a solution , with efforts being made to acquire Cuba ( see : Ostend Manifesto , 1852 ) and to annex Nicaragua ( see : Walker affair , 1856–57 ) , both to be slave states .
In 1854 , the Missouri Compromise of 1820 was superseded by the Kansas – Nebraska Act , which allowed white male settlers in the new territories to determine through popular sovereignty whether they would allow slavery within each territory .
The result was that pro- and anti - slavery elements flooded into Kansas with the goal of voting slavery up or down , leading to bloody fighting .
An effort was initiated to organize Kansas for admission as a slave state , paired with Minnesota , but the admission of Kansas as a slave state was blocked because of questions over the legitimacy of its slave state constitution .
Anti - slavery settlers in " Bleeding Kansas " in the 1850s were called Free - Staters and Free - Soilers , because they fought ( successfully ) to include Kansas in the Union as a free state in 1861 .
When the admission of Minnesota proceeded unimpeded in 1858 , the balance in the Senate was lost ; a loss that was compounded by the subsequent admission of Oregon as a free state in 1859 . SLAVE AND FREE STATE PAIRS Section::::Slave and free state pairs .
Before 1812 , the concern about balancing slave - states and free states was not profound .
This is how the states lined up in 1812 .

WEST VIRGINIA
Section::::West Virginia .
During the Civil War , a Unionist government in Wheeling , Virginia , presented a statehood bill to Congress in order to create a new state from 48 counties in western Virginia .
The new state would eventually incorporate 50 counties .
The issue of slavery in the new state delayed approval of the bill .
In the Senate Charles Sumner objected to the admission of a new slave state , while Benjamin Wade defended statehood as long as a gradual emancipation clause would be included in the new state constitution .
Two senators represented the Unionist Virginia government , John S. Carlile and Waitman T. Willey .
Senator Carlile objected that Congress had no right to impose emancipation on West Virginia , while Willey proposed a compromise amendment to the state constitution for gradual abolition .
Sumner attempted to add his own amendment to the bill , which was defeated , and the statehood bill passed both houses of Congress with the addition of what became known as the Willey Amendment .
President Lincoln signed the bill on December 31 , 1862 .
Voters in western Virginia approved the Willey Amendment on March 26 , 1863 .
President Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1 , 1863 , which exempted from emancipation the border states ( four slave states loyal to the Union ) as well as some territories occupied by Union forces within Confederate states .
Two additional counties were added to West Virginia in late 1863 , Berkeley and Jefferson .
The slaves in Berkeley were also under exemption but not those in Jefferson County .
As of the census of 1860 , the 49 exempted counties held some 6000 slaves over 21 years of age who would not have been emancipated , about 40 % of the total slave population .
The terms of the Willey Amendment only freed children , at birth or as they came of age , and prohibited the importation of slaves .
West Virginia became the 35th state on June 20 , 1863 , and the last slave state admitted to the Union .
Eighteen months later , the West Virginia legislature completely abolished slavery , and also ratified the 13th Amendment on February 3 , 1865 .
END OF SLAVERY Section::::End of slavery .
At the start of the Civil War , there were 34 states in the United States , 15 of which were slave states .
Eleven of these slave states issued various emergency declarations of secession from the United States to form the Confederacy and were represented in the Confederate Congress .
The slave states that stayed in the Union , Maryland , Missouri , Delaware , and Kentucky ( called , border states ) were seated in the U.S. Congress .
By the time the Emancipation Proclamation was issued in 1863 , Tennessee was already in Union control .
Accordingly , the Proclamation applied only to the 10 remaining Confederate states .
Abolition of slavery became a condition of the return of local rule and restoration in those states that had declared their secession .
The border states of Maryland ( November 1864 ) and Missouri ( January 1865 ) , one of the Confederate states , Tennessee ( January 1865 ) , and the new state of West Virginia ( February 1865 ) , abolished slavery just prior to the end of the Civil War ( May 1865 ) .
In the District of Columbia , slavery was abolished in 1862 .
However , slavery persisted in Delaware , Kentucky , and 10 of the 11 of the former Confederate states , until the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution abolished slavery throughout the United States on December 6 , 1865 , ending the distinction between slave and free states .
