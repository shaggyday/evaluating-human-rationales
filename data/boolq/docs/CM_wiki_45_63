PASILLA
The pasilla chile or chile negro is the dried form of the chilaca chili pepper , a long and narrow member of species Capsicum annuum .
Named for its dark , wrinkled skin and pronounced pah - SEE - yah ( literally " little raisin " ) , it is a mild to medium - hot , rich - flavored chile .
As dried , it is generally 6 to 8 in ( 15 to 20 cm ) long and 1.0 to 1.5 in ( 2.5 to 4 cm ) in diameter .
The fresh narrow chilaca can measure up to 9.0 in ( 22 cm )
long and often has a twisted shape , which is seldom apparent after drying .
It turns from dark green to dark brown when fully mature .
In the United States , producers and grocers sometimes incorrectly use " pasilla " to describe the poblano , a different , wider variety of pepper , the dried form of which is called an ancho .
