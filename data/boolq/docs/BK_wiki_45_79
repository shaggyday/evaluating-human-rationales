PLOT Section::::Plot .
A Game of Thrones follows three principal storylines simultaneously .
IN THE SEVEN KINGDOMS Section::::In the Seven Kingdoms .
At the beginning of the story , Lord Eddard " Ned " Stark executes a deserter from the Night 's Watch , who has betrayed his vows and fled from the Wall .
On the way back , his children adopt six direwolf pups , the animal of his sigil .
There are three male and two female direwolf pups , as well as an albino runt , which align with his three trueborn sons , two trueborn daughters , and one bastard son .
That night , Ned receives word of the death of his mentor , Lord Jon Arryn , the principal advisor to Ned 's childhood friend , King Robert Baratheon .
During his own visit to Ned 's castle of Winterfell , Robert recruits Ned to replace Arryn as the King 's Hand .
Ned is reluctant , but agrees to go when he learns that Arryn 's widow Lysa believes Queen Cersei Lannister and her family poisoned Arryn .
Shortly thereafter , Ned 's son Bran inadvertently discovers Cersei having sex with her twin brother Jaime Lannister , who throws Bran from the tower to conceal their affair .
Ned and his daughters Sansa and
Arya depart for the royal capital of King 's Landing , while his wife Catelyn , a comatose Bran , and their other sons Robb and Rickon remain at Winterfell .
During the journey south , a physical altercation between Arya and Robert 's son , Prince Joffrey , to whom Sansa has been betrothed , increases both the tension between the Starks and the Lannisters and the sibling rivalry between Arya and Sansa .
Arya 's direwolf Nymeria attacks Joffrey to protect her , and Arya chases Nymeria away to protect her from the Lannisters ' wrath , therefore Sansa 's direwolf Lady is executed in Nymeria 's place .
Upon arriving in King 's Landing to take his post as Hand , Ned finds that Robert is an ineffective king whose only interests are hunting , drinking and womanizing with the realm being governed by his Small Council .
Robert tells Ned of his wish to abdicate as he is bored by his kingly duties , but does not as he fears what his heir Joffrey might do as king .
At Winterfell , an assassin attempts to kill Bran , thwarted only by his direwolf Summer .
Catelyn departs for King 's Landing to bring word of this to Ned .
Shortly after that , Bran awakens as a paraplegic , with no memory of the cause of his fall .
Upon Catelyn 's arrival in King 's Landing , she is brought to her childhood friend , Petyr " Littlefinger " Baelish , who identifies Tyrion Lannister , the dwarf brother of Cersei and Jaime , as the owner of the dagger used against Bran , and agrees to help Ned investigate the possibility of Lannister treason .
During her return to Winterfell , Catelyn meets Tyrion by chance on the Kingsroad , arrests him , and takes him to her sister Lysa Arryn 's stronghold in the Vale , where Tyrion demands trial by combat and regains his freedom when his champion , a mercenary named Bronn , is victorious .
Tyrion recruits a force of tribesmen from the Vale as his private army with the aim of seeking revenge on Arryn for her mistreatment of him .
In retaliation for Tyrion 's abduction , his father Lord Tywin Lannister sends soldiers led by his brutish bannerman Gregor " The Mountain " Clegane to raid Catelyn 's homeland , the Riverlands .
In King 's Landing , Ned finds Robert 's eldest brother Stannis Baratheon left the city after Jon Arryn 's death for his island of Dragonstone .
Ned begins to investigate into Jon Arryn 's affairs , which leads him to visiting locations where Jon Arryn visited with Stannis - including places where Robert 's bastard children are found .
On the way back from one such place , Ned and his soldiers are waylaid by Jaime Lannister , who demands Tyrion 's return , and when he does not get what he wants he orders Ned 's men be killed - in the ensuing skirmish , Ned is crippled in one leg when his horse collapses on top of him .
Even afterwards , Ned continues to investigate and eventually discovers that Robert 's legal heirs , including Joffrey , are in fact Cersei 's children by Jaime and that Jon Arryn was killed to conceal his discovery of their incest .
Ned offers Cersei a chance to flee before he informs Robert , but she uses this chance to arrange Robert 's death in a hunting accident .
Ned , made lord - regent by Robert 's will , enlists Littlefinger 's help to secure the loyalty and assistance of the city guards to challenge Joffrey 's claim on the throne and place Stannis on the throne ; but Littlefinger betrays him , resulting in Ned 's arrest , and the death of his men .
The spymaster on the Small Council , the eunuch Varys , accuses Ned of " madness " in revealing to Cersei his knowledge of her incestuous relationship .
Whilst Joffrey is crowned King of the Seven Kingdoms , Ned eventually agrees to falsely confess to high treason and join the Night 's Watch in exchange for Sansa and Arya 's safety , but Joffrey has him beheaded anyway .
Whilst Sansa is retained into custody , Arya escapes with the help of her fencing instructor , Syrio Forel , and Yoren , a recruiting agent for the Night 's Watch .
Robb Stark has gathered an army and marched south in response to his father 's arrest ; and upon learning of Ned 's death , attempts to raise further support from and to aid his maternal grandfather , Lord Hoster Tully .
To reach the Tully lands , he agrees to a marital alliance with the notoriously unreliable House Frey , who control the intervening territory but declined to assist the Tullys despite being sworn to Riverrun .
Tywin confronts a Northern - Riverlands force commanded by Roose Bolton and assigns Tyrion and his tribesmen to his vanguard out of the hope he will be killed in the coming battle .
Tyrion begins a relationship with the prostitute Shae and survives the battle , which ends in a Lannister victory .
However , the force commanded by Bolton was merely a feint and Robb commands his main force to the relief of Riverrun .
Robb proves victorious against Jaime Lannister at the Battle of the Whispering Wood , who is captured and taken prisoner , while his father Tywin decides to withdraw to the southern border of the Tully lands , sending Tyrion to King 's Landing to keep Joffrey under control .
When Robb elects not to ally himself with Robert 's brothers Renly and Stannis , who have both made claims to the throne , the Riverlands and Northern lords hail him as " King in the North " : his family 's ancestral title .
ON THE WALL Section::::On
the Wall .
The prologue of the novel introduces the Wall : an ancient barrier of stone , ice , and magic , hundreds of feet high and hundreds of miles long , shielding the Seven Kingdoms from the Northern wilderness .
The Wall is manned by the Night 's Watch : an order of warriors sworn to serve there for life , forgoing marriage , titles , property , and children .
North of the Wall , a small patrol of Rangers from the Night 's Watch encounter the Others , an ancient and hostile race of superhumans .
All of the Rangers are killed except the single survivor later executed by Eddard Stark for desertion .
Jon Snow , the bastard son of Eddard Stark , is inspired by his uncle , Benjen Stark , to join the Night 's Watch , but becomes disillusioned when he discovers that its primary use is that of a penal colony for criminals , meant to keep " wildlings " , human tribesmen in relative anarchy north of the Wall , in check .
Tyrion , who comes to the Wall with Jon for a visit , talks with the Lord Commander , Jeor Mormont who tells him that a long winter is coming , the Wall is undermanned , and there is evidence that the Others have returned .
At the Wall , Jon unites the recruits against their harsh instructor and protects the cowardly but good - natured and intelligent Samwell Tarly .
Jon hopes that his combat skills will earn him assignment to the Rangers , the military arm of the Night 's Watch , but instead is made a steward to the leader of the Watch , Lord Commander Jeor Mormont , potentially making Jon the successor to Mormont .
Benjen , who had led a small party of Rangers beyond the Wall , fails to return , and six months later , the dead bodies of two of the Rangers from his party are recovered beyond the Wall , but soon re - animate as wights , which kill six men and threaten Mormont before being dispatched by Jon .
Out of gratitude , Mormont awards Jon his family 's sword of Valyrian Steel , named " Longclaw " .
When word of his father 's execution reaches Jon , he attempts to join Robb against the Lannisters but is prevented by his comrades and persuaded by Mormont to remain loyal to the Watch .
Mormont then declares his intention to find Benjen — dead or alive — and to investigate the disappearance of many wildlings and the dark rumors surrounding " the King - Beyond - the - Wall " : a deserter from the Night 's Watch known as Mance Rayder .
ACROSS THE NARROW SEA Section::::Across the narrow sea .
In Pentos , a city - state of Essos , a continent to the east of Westeros , Viserys Targaryen , son of the king overthrown by Robert Baratheon , betroths his sister Daenerys to Khal Drogo , a warlord of the nomadic Dothraki , in exchange for the use of Drogo 's army to reclaim the throne of Westeros .
Illyrio , a wealthy merchant who has been supporting the penniless Targaryens and brokered the marriage , gives Daenerys three petrified dragon eggs as a wedding gift .
Jorah Mormont ( son of Jeor Mormont ) , a knight exiled from Westeros , joins Viserys as an adviser .
Daenerys is a 13 year old , dominated by her older brother , and is surprised when Jorah describes Viserys as a future tyrant .
Jorah further tells Daenerys that the " common folk " do not long for a Targaryen restoration as believed by Viserys and are indifferent to the " game of thrones " played by the elite , just wanting to live in peace .
Initially terrified of her new husband and his people , Daenerys eventually embraces the role of Drogo 's queen .
When Drogo shows little interest in conquering Westeros , Viserys tries to browbeat his sister into coercing Drogo , but she refuses .
When Viserys publicly threatens Daenerys , Drogo executes him by pouring molten gold on his head .
After that , an assassin seeking King Robert 's favor attempts to poison Daenerys and her unborn child , and Drogo agrees to help her conquer Westeros .
It is implied that Jorah , who is secretly a spy for Robert , was aware of the plans for Daenerys ' murder , which he foils .
While sacking villages to fund the invasion , Drogo is wounded , and Daenerys commands a captive folk healer to save him .
When he is beyond saving , the healer , angered by the Dothraki raids , sacrifices Daenerys ' unborn child to power the spell to save Drogo 's life , which restores Drogo 's health but leaves him in a vegetative state .
Daenerys has a prophetic dream , which she learns she is the " last dragon " , which gives her strength .
Most of the Dothraki army departs to follow a new leader after Drogo is incapacitated .
Daenerys smothers Drogo with a pillow and orders the healer tied to Drogo 's funeral pyre .
She places her three dragon eggs on the pyre , enters it herself , and emerges unscathed with three newly hatched dragons suckling at her breasts .
The remaining Dothraki and Jorah Mormont , awe - struck , swear allegiance to her .
THEMES Section::::Themes .
Throughout the novel , characters are often faced with decisions that match one redeemable trait against another .
The Guardian outlines characters who are frequently " forced to choose between their love for those close to them and the greater interests of honour , duty and the realm . "
In Westeros , Ned ultimately decides to venture south with Robert , leaving much of his family in Winterfell .
At the Wall , Jon wrestles with the predicament of joining his half - brother Robb in rebellion or staying with his sworn brothers in the Night 's Watch .
Daenerys has issue with the Dothraki treatment of those they conquered in Essos .
These conflicts characters encounter oftentimes reflect inconsistent decision making .
Catelyn initially is overwhelmed by grief and does not leave Bran 's bedside while he is comatose , ignoring her political responsibilities , choosing family over duty .
But soon after , Catelyn leaves Bran and her family for Kings Landing to inform Ned of potential Lannister treason , effectively displaying a more duty fulfilling role .
Family , duty , and honor play major roles in conflicts that arise in the story arc , and qualities traditionally categorized as noble oppose each other in resolution .
Character decision conflicts and consequence analysis are particular to how Martin wants to portray fantasy .
Martin characteristically deviates from the traditional fantasy model and clear - cut lines of good versus evil .
Martin reflects : " I think the battle between good and evil is fought largely within the individual human heart , by the decisions that we make .
It 's not like evil dresses up in black clothing
and you know , they 're really ugly " .
This viewpoint characterizes the book and is evident in the actions of several different families which frequently have conflicts with each other .
The Starks ' and Lannisters ' conflict is a central component of the novel , and the reader receives points of view from both sides .
Likewise , Daenerys ' storyline develops around the Targaryen 's upheaval in Westeros , in which the Starks played a significant role .
Martin argues :
Having multiple viewpoints is crucial to the grayness of the characters .
You have to be able to see the struggle from both sides , because real human beings in a war have all these processes of self - justification , telling ourselves why what we 're doing is the right thing .

A Game of Thrones has received critical acclaim .
Lauren K. Nathan of the Associated Press wrote that the book " grip[s ] the reader from Page One " and is set in a " magnificent " fantasy world that is " mystical , but still believable . "
Steve Perry told readers of The Oregonian that the plot is " complex and fascinating " and the book is " rich and colorful " with " all the elements of a great fantasy novel " .
Writing in The Washington Post , John H. Riskind commented that " many fans of sword - and - sorcery will enjoy the epic scope of this book " but felt that the book " suffers from one - dimensional characters and less than memorable imagery . "
Phyllis Eisenstein of the Chicago Sun - Times wrote that , although the book uses many generic fantasy tropes , Martin 's approach is " so refreshingly human and intimate that it transcends them . "
She described it as " an absorbing combination of the mythic , the sweepingly historical , and the intensely personal . "
John Prior , writing in the San Diego Union - Tribune , called Martin 's writing " strong and imaginative , with plenty of Byzantine intrigue and dynastic struggle " , and compared it to Robert Jordan 's Wheel of Time books , " though much darker , with no comedy or romance to relieve the nastiness .
