INTERNATIONAL STUDIES International Studies ( IS ) generally refers to the specific university degrees and courses which are concerned with the study of ' the major political , economic , social , and cultural issues that dominate the international agenda ' .
Predominant topics are politics , economics and law on a global level .
The term itself can be more specifically defined as ' the contemporary and historical understanding of global societies , cultures , languages and systems of government and of the complex relationships between them that shape the world we live in ' .
The terms and concepts of International Studies and international relations are strongly related ; however , International relations focus more directly on the relationship between countries , whereas International Studies can encompass all phenomena which are globally oriented .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The history of the discipline of International Studies is strongly linked with the history of the study of international relations , as described in the International Relations entry .
However , the study of International Studies as a separate entity to International Relations emerged throughout the 20th century , as an increasingly complex world began to be influenced by globalization , and a greater number of issues emerged ( rather than only inter - country relations ) .
The discipline was greatly influenced by the establishment of the International Studies Association , which was established in 1959 by a ' group of academics and practitioners ' with the aim of ' seeking to pursue mutual interests in world affairs through the organization of a professional association ' .
The establishment of the association reflected the increasing interest in global issues and reflected the need for international academic dialogue .
In 2008 , the third OCIS conference ( Oceanic Conference on International Studies ) was held at the University of Queensland ' .
The conference brought together over 200 academics , with the keynote speaker Andrew Linklater ( the Woodrow Wilson Professor of International Politics at the University of Aberystwyth in Wales ) noting ' how vibrant and intellectually stimulating International Studies now is in Australia ' ' .
The increasing popularity of the discipline in Australia led to the International Studies Association to establish an Asia - Pacific Regional Section of the ISA at the University of Queensland in 2009 ' , which was seen as an ' indication of the growth of this area ' ' in Australia .
ETYMOLOGY Section::::Etymology .
International Studies is sometimes also known as global studies .
The terms can be used interchangeably and may be influenced by left vs right inclinations .
PURPOSE / AIM OF STUDY
Section::::Purpose / aim of study .
Many educational institutions have developed International Studies degrees and courses in order to engage students with the increasing number of issues and phenomena which have arisen in an increasingly globalized world .
As such , most education providers justify the need for the degrees by relating the increasing importance of the discipline with real - world situations and employment opportunities .
For example , the University of Technology Sydney states that the purpose of their International Studies degree is to ' prepare graduates for careers and contributions in a world of social and cultural diversity being transformed by globalisation , allowing students to draw connections between global phenomena and local practices in work and life ' .
Often , universities will relate the study of International studies with other industries .
Monash University describes the relevance for International Studies ; ' as the world globalizes and nations and economies become more integrated , it is important to understand our world and the ideas and beliefs of our neighbors and trading partners .
In order to compete in the international marketplaces of products , ideas and knowledge we need to understand and respect the cultures and beliefs of others .
