DOUBLES QUALIFICATION Section::::Qualification .
The Badminton World Federation 's ranking list is used to determine qualification for the Olympic tournament .
For singles , 29 competitors are selected .
For doubles , 19 pairs are selected .
The general method of selection is by ranking , though the selection process stops once all qualification positions are filled .
All players or pairs from the top 16 places on that list qualify , though each National Olympic Committee can send a maximum of three players / pairs .
Players and pairs through the 64th place on that ranking qualify , with the caveat that each NOC can send only two players / pairs from that portion of the list .
Players and pairs ranked below that only qualify if they are the highest ranked competitor from their nation .
In addition , one place in each of the singles events is awarded by the Tripartite Commission .
There are also regulations on minimum representation .
Each continent must have at least one player / pair .
This is the highest ranked player / pair from that continent if none have qualified through the standard selection process .
The host nation , if it has not already qualified two competitors , receives two slots as well , either two singles players or one pair .
COMPETITION Section::::Competition .
Olympic badminton consists of a single - elimination tournament .
Each match is played to the best of three games .
Games are to 21 points .
Rally scoring is used , meaning a player does not need to be serving to score .
A player must win by two points or be the first player to 30 points .
