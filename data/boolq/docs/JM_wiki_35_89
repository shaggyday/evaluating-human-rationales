Matt Youngberg and Francisco Angones grew up watching the original series , and had always wanted to develop an updated version for a newer generation .
Youngberg said , " We 're hoping that in thirty years , the kids who watch our show will then be bringing back the next version of DuckTales because they loved what we did so much . "
In May 2015 , Terry McGovern , the original voice of Launchpad McQuack , stated in an interview that the entire voice cast from the original series would not be returning for the reboot , which made him " heartsick " at the news .
The new voice cast for the series was revealed on December 16 , 2016 in a video where they sing an a cappella version of the original theme song in promotion of the news .
The following May , Lin - Manuel Miranda was announced as the voice of Fenton Crackshell - Cabrera / Gizmoduck .
The character was changed to being Latino due to Lin - Manuel 's heritage and because Angones felt that there were not enough positive Latino superheroes .
In June , more cast members , including Tony Anselmo reprising his role as Donald Duck , were announced , and during the 2017 San Diego Comic - Con , Disney announced that Darkwing Duck would also make an appearance in the TV series .
The art style of the show is heavily influenced not just by Carl Barks ' original Uncle Scrooge comics , but also some of Barks ' paintings .
The theme song , written by Mark Mueller for the 1987 series , was re - recorded for the 2017 reboot .
It was arranged by Michael " Smidi " Smithand and TJ Stafford and sung by Felicia Barton .
