THE OPEN CHAMPIONSHIP
The Open Championship , often referred to as The Open or the British Open , is an annual golf tournament conducted by The R&A.
It is one of the four major championships in professional golf , and is the oldest of the four .
The Open is traditionally played in mid - July ; beginning 2019 , with the rescheduling of the PGA Championship to May , the tournament will be the final major of the golf season .
It was first played in 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club in Scotland .
The Open has always been held in the United Kingdom and is the only major played outside the United States .
The current champion is Francesco Molinari , who won the 147th Open at Carnoustie in 2018 with a score of 276 .
The 2019 Open Championship will be held at Royal Portrush Golf Club in Northern Ireland .
It was held at Portrush in 1951 , the only occasion that it has not been held in Scotland or England .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The Open was first played on 17 October 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club in Scotland .
The inaugural tournament was restricted to professionals and attracted a field of eight golfers who played three rounds of Prestwick 's twelve - hole course in a single day .
Willie Park Sr . won with a score of 174 , beating Old Tom Morris , by two strokes .
The following year the tournament was opened to amateurs ; eight of them joined ten professionals in the field .
James Ogilvie Fairlie was the principal organiser of the first Open Championship held at Prestwick in 1860 .
With the untimely death of Allan Robertson , aged 43 in 1859 , Prestwick members decided to conduct a challenge the following year that would determine the land 's greatest golfer .
In a proposed competition for a " Challenge Belt " , Fairlie sent out a series of letters to Blackheath , Perth , Edinburgh , Musselburgh and St Andrews , inviting a player known as a " respectable caddie " to represent each of the clubs in a tournament to be held on 17 October 1860 .
Originally , the trophy presented to the event 's winner was the Challenge Belt , a red leather belt with a silver buckle .
The Challenge Belt was retired in 1870 , when Young Tom Morris was allowed to keep it for winning the tournament three consecutive times .
Because no trophy was available , the tournament was cancelled in 1871 .
In 1872 , after Young Tom Morris won again for a fourth time in a row , he was awarded a medal .
The present trophy , The Golf Champion Trophy , better known by its popular name of the Claret Jug , was then created .
Prestwick administered The Open from 1860 to 1870 .
In 1871 , it agreed to organise it jointly with The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews and The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers .
In 1892 the event was doubled in length from 36 to 72 holes , four rounds of what was by then the standard complement of 18 holes .
The 1894 Open was the first held outside Scotland , at the Royal St George 's Golf Club in England .
Because of an increasing number of entrants , a cut was introduced after two rounds in 1898 .
In 1920 full responsibility for The Open Championship was handed over to The Royal & Ancient Golf Club .
The early winners were all Scottish professionals , who in those days worked as greenkeepers , clubmakers , and caddies to supplement their modest winnings from championships and challenge matches .
The Open has always been dominated by professionals , with only six victories by amateurs , all of which occurred between 1890 and 1930 .
The last of these was Bobby Jones ' third Open and part of his celebrated Grand Slam .
Jones was one of six Americans who won The Open between the First and Second World Wars , the first of whom had been Walter Hagen in 1922 .
These Americans and the French winner of the 1907 Open , Arnaud Massy , were the only winners from outside Scotland and England up to 1939 .
The first post - World War II winner was the American Sam Snead , in 1946 .
In 1947 , Northern Ireland 's Fred Daly was victorious .
While there have been many English and Scottish champions , Daly was the only winner from Ireland until the 2007 victory by Pádraig Harrington .
There has never been a Welsh champion .
In the early postwar years The Open was dominated by golfers from the Commonwealth , with South African Bobby Locke and Australian Peter Thomson winning the Claret Jug in eight of the 11 championships from 1948 and 1958 between them .
During this period , The Open often had a schedule conflict with the match - play PGA Championship , which meant that Ben Hogan , the best American golfer at this time , competed in The Open just once , in 1953 at Carnoustie , a tournament he won .
Another South African , Gary Player was Champion in 1959 .
This was at the beginning of the " Big Three " era in professional golf , the three players in question being Player , Arnold Palmer , and Jack Nicklaus .
Palmer first competed in 1960 , when he came second to the little - known Australian Kel Nagle , but he won the next two years .
While he was far from being the first American to become Open Champion , he was the first that many Americans saw win the tournament on television , and his charismatic success is often credited with persuading leading American golfers to make The Open an integral part of their schedule , rather than an optional extra .
The improvement of trans - Atlantic travel also increased American participation .
Nicklaus ' victories came in 1966 , 1970 , and 1978 .
Although his tally of three wins is the least of his majors , it greatly understates how prominent Nicklaus was at the Open throughout the 1960s and 1970s .
He finished runner - up seven times , which is the record and had a total of sixteen top-5 finishes , which is tied most in Open history with John Henry Taylor and easily the most in the postwar era .
Nicklaus also holds the records for most rounds under par ( 61 ) and most aggregates under par ( 14 ) .
At Turnberry in 1977 he was involved in one of the most celebrated contests in golf history , when his duel with Tom Watson went to the final shot before Watson emerged as the champion for the second time with a record score of 268 ( 12 under par ) .
Watson won five Opens , more than anyone else has since the 1950s , but his final win in 1983 brought down the curtain on an era of U.S. domination .
In the next 11 years there was only one American winner , with the others coming from Europe and the Commonwealth .
The European winners of this era , Spaniard Seve Ballesteros , Sandy Lyle , who was the first Scottish winner in over half a century , and the Englishman Nick Faldo , were also leading lights among the group of players who began to get the better of the Americans in the Ryder Cup during this period .
In 1995 , John Daly 's playoff win over Italian Costantino Rocca began another era of American domination .
Tiger Woods won three Championships , two at St Andrews in 2000 and 2005 , and one at Hoylake in 2006 .
There was a dramatic moment at St Andrews in 2000 , as the ageing Jack Nicklaus waved farewell to the crowds , while the young challenger to his crown watched from a nearby tee .
Nicklaus later decided to play in The Open for one final time in 2005 , when the R&A announced St Andrews as the venue , giving his final farewell to the fans at the Home of Golf .
There have also been wins by previously little known golfers , including Paul Lawrie 's playoff win after the 72nd - hole collapse of Jean van de Velde in 1999 , Ben Curtis in 2003 and Todd Hamilton in 2004 .
In 2007 , the Europeans finally broke an eight - year drought in the majors when Pádraig Harrington of Ireland defeated Sergio García by one stroke in a four - hole playoff at Carnoustie .
Harrington retained the Championship in 2008 .
In 2009 , 59-year - old Tom Watson turned in one of the most remarkable performances ever seen at The Open .
Leading the tournament through 71 holes and needing just a par on the last hole to become the oldest ever winner of a major championship , Watson bogeyed , setting up a four - hole playoff , which he would lose to Stewart Cink .
In 2013 , Phil Mickelson won his first Open Championship at Muirfield .
His victory meant that he had won 3 of the 4 majors in pursuit of the career grand slam , just needing the U.S. Open , where he has finished runner - up six times .
In 2015 , Zach Johnson denied Jordan Spieth his chance of winning the Grand Slam by winning an aggregate playoff over Louis Oosthuizen and Marc Leishman at the Old Course at St Andrews .
FORMAT Section::::Format .
The Open is a 72-hole stroke play tournament contested over four days , Thursday through Sunday .
Since 1979 it has been played in the week which includes the 3rd Friday in July .
Currently , 156 players are in the field , mostly made up of the world 's leading professionals , who are given exemptions , along with winners of the top amateur championships .
Further places are given to players , amateurs and professionals , who are successful in a number of qualifying events .
There is a cut after 36 holes after which only the leading 70 players ( and ties ) play in the final 36 holes on the weekend .
In the event of a tie after 72 holes , a four - hole aggregate playoff is held ; if two or more players are still tied , it continues as sudden - death until there is a winner .

HOST COURSES
Section::::Host courses .
The common factor in the venues is links courses .
The Open has always been played in Scotland , northwest England , and southeast England , along with one course in Northern Ireland which will again stage the competition in 2019 .
From 1860 to 1870 The Open was organised by and played at Prestwick Golf Club .
From its revival in 1872 until 1891 it was played on three courses in rotation :
Prestwick , The Old Course at St Andrews , and Musselburgh Links .
In 1892 the newly built Muirfield replaced Musselburgh in the rotation .
In 1893 two English courses , Royal St George 's and Royal Liverpool Golf Club , Hoylake , were invited to join the rotation with Royal St George 's being allocated the 1894 Open and Royal Liverpool having the 1897 event .
At a meeting in 1907 Royal Cinque Ports Golf Club became the sixth course on the rota , being allocated the 1909 Open .
With three courses in both England and Scotland , the meeting also agreed that the Championship was to be played in England and Scotland alternately .
The alternation of venues in England and Scotland continued until the Second World War .
The rotation of the six courses was reinstated after the First World War with Royal Cinque Ports hosting the first post - war Open in 1920 .
It had been chosen as the venue for the cancelled 1915 Open .
In 1923 Troon was used instead of Muirfield when " some doubts exists as to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers being desirous of their course being used for the event " .
Muirfield returned as the venue in 1929 .
Serious overcrowding problems at Prestwick in 1925 meant that the course was never again used for the Open and was replaced by Carnoustie as the third Scottish course .
While Royal St George 's and Royal Liverpool continued to be used at six - year intervals the third English course varied .
After Royal Cinque Ports in 1920 , Royal Lytham was used in 1926 and
then Prince 's in 1932 .
Royal Cinque Ports was intended as the venue in 1938 but in February of that year abnormal high tides caused severe flooding to the course leaving it like " an inland sea several feet deep " and the venue was switched to Royal St George 's .
Birkdale was chosen as the venue for 1940 , although the event was cancelled because of the Second World War .
There are ten courses in the current rota , five in Scotland , four in England and one in Northern Ireland .
In recent times the Old Course has hosted the Open every five years .
The remaining courses host the Open roughly every 10 years but the gaps between hosting Opens may be longer or shorter than this .
In 2014 , it was announced by The R&A that Royal Portrush was returning to the active rota and in October 2015 Portrush was confirmed as the venue for the 2019 Open .
The most recent course to be removed from the active rota was Muirfield in May 2016 , following The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers refusal to permit female members to join their club .
On 14 March 2017 , the members voted to admit females ; the R&A subsequently stated that Muirfield would be welcomed back to the Open rota .
From 1894 ( when it was first played in England ) to 2018 , it has been played 63 times in Scotland , 50 times in England and once in Northern Ireland .
It was not until 2011 and 2012 that England hosted consecutive Opens .

Ref QUALIFICATION Section::::Qualification .
The field for the Open is 156 , and golfers gain a place in a number of ways .
Most of the field is made up of leading players who are given exemptions .
Further places are given to players who are successful in The Open Qualifying Series and in Final Qualifying .
Any remaining places , and places made available because qualified players are not competing , are made available to the highest ranked players in the Official World Golf Ranking .
There are currently 27 exemption categories .
Among the more significant are : * The top 50 on the Official World Golf Ranking .
This category means that no member of the current elite of world golf will be excluded .
*
The top 30 in the previous season 's European Tour Race to Dubai and the 30 qualifiers for Tour Championship .
Most of these players will also be in the World top 50 .
*
All previous Open Champions who will be age 60 or under on the final day of the tournament .
Each year a number of past champions choose not to compete .
*
All players who have won one of the other three majors in the previous five years .
* The top 10 from the previous year 's Open Championship .
*
The winners of The Amateur Championship and the U.S. Amateur ( provided the winners maintain their amateur status prior to the tournament ) .
International qualifying is through the " Open Qualifying Series " .
About ten tournaments are selected each year .
These currently consist of one event from the PGA Tour of Australasia , the Asian Tour , the Sunshine Tour , the Japan Golf Tour and the Korean Tour and three from the European Tour and the PGA Tour .
A pre - allocated number of places are made available at these tournaments ( from 1 to 4 ) which are given to the leading players in those events who are not , at that point , qualified for the Open , provided they finish in a high - enough position .
In 2018 a total of 34 places were available .
Local qualifying was the traditional way for non - exempt players to win a place at The Open .
In recent years it has comprised a number of " Regional Qualifying " competitions around Britain and Ireland with successful competitors , joined by those players exempt from regional qualifying , playing in 36-hole " Final Qualifying " tournaments .
In 2018 there were 12 places available through Final Qualifying , three at each of the four venues .
TIMELINE OF QUALIFICATION CHANGES Section::::Timeline of qualification changes .

Open Qualifying Series introduced replacing International Final Qualifying TOURNAMENT NAME Section::::Tournament name .
In Britain , the tournament is best known by its official title , The Open Championship , or simply the Open .
Outside of the United Kingdom , the tournament is often referred to as the " British Open " to disambiguate the tournament from other national open golf tournaments , such as the U.S. Open .
Likewise , the Masters and PGA Championship are often referred to as the " U.S. Masters " and " U.S. PGA Championship " outside of the United States , the latter being distinguished in the UK from the European Tour 's BMW PGA Championship .
Although it is not the official title of the men 's championship , the Open 's women 's counterpart is officially titled the Women 's British Open .
The R&A has contractually required its media rightsholders to refer to the event as The Open Championship ; NBC presenter Johnny Miller admitted that during the network 's first year as U.S. broadcaster , he sometimes had to correct himself on - air after accidentally referring to the event as the " British Open " .
Some U.S. critics have argued that the insistence of referring to the tournament as " The Open " is an expression of exceptionalism for the event by the R&A in comparison to other open golf tournaments , albeit one that is justified due to its history .
Alastair Johnston of IMG , who markets the tournament and its media rights internationally , remarked that negotiations in some regions had been complicated by local executives who did not believe it was appropriate to refer to the event as simply " The Open Championship " .
TOUR
STATUS Section::::Tour status .
The Open Championship has been an official event on the PGA Tour since 1995 .
Because of this , the prize money won in The Open by PGA Tour members is included on the official money list .
In addition , all Open Championships before 1995 have been retroactively classified as PGA Tour wins , and the list of players with the most wins on the PGA Tour has been adjusted to reflect this .
The European Tour has recognised The Open as an official event since its first official season in 1972 , and it is also an official money event on the Japan Golf Tour .
PRIZE MONEY Section::::Prize money .
The 2015 edition had a total prize money fund of £ 6.3 million and a first prize of £ 1.15 million , which equated to about $ 9.8 million and $ 1.8 million , respectively .
The other three major championships in 2015 had prize money of $ 10.0 million and first prizes of $ 1.8 million , so that all four majors had similar prize money .
Prize money is given to all professionals who make the cut and , since the number of professionals making the cut changes from year to year , the total prize money varies somewhat from the advertised number .
The prize fund in 2016 was £ 6.5 million , with a winner 's share of £ 1.175 million ; about $ 8.6 million and $ 1.55 million .
The other majors had prize money of at least $ 10.0 million and first prizes of at least $ 1.8 million .
The relative decline in prize money , in dollar terms , was attributable to a fall in the £ /$ exchange rate .
For the first time in 2017 , the prize money was denominated in U.S. dollars .
With total prize money of $ 10.25 million ( £ 7.89 million ) , it was somewhat lower than the other major championships , $ 11 million at the Masters , $ 12 million for the U.S. Open and $ 10.5 million at the PGA Championship .
There was no prize money in the first three Opens .
In 1863 , a prize fund of ten pounds was introduced , which was shared between the second- , third- , and fourth - placed professionals , with the champion keeping the belt for a year .
Old Tom Morris won the first champion 's cash prize of six pounds in 1864 .
Until the late 1990s , The Open prize fund was significantly lower than the other three majors ; by 2002 , it was the highest .

As of 2016 , European Tour Productions serves as the host broadcaster for the Open Championship .
The host broadcaster , as well as British and American broadcasters Sky Sports and NBC Sports , utilized a total of 175 cameras during the 2016 tournament .
UNITED KINGDOM Section::::United Kingdom .
In the United Kingdom , the Open Championship was historically broadcast by the BBC — a relationship which lasted from 1955 to 2015 .
The BBC 's rights to the Open had been threatened by the event 's removal from Category A of Ofcom 's " listed " events , a status which legally mandated that the Open be broadcast in its entirety by a terrestrial broadcaster .
It had since been moved to Category B , meaning that television rights to the tournament could now be acquired by a pay television outlet , such as BT Sport or Sky Sports , as long as rights to broadcast a highlights programme or otherwise delayed coverage are sub - licensed to either the BBC , ITV , Channel 4 , or Channel 5 .
Former R&A chief executive Peter Dawson had become critical of the quality of the BBC 's television coverage , stating alongside its final renewal in 2010 that " They know we 've got our eye on them .

The Guardian felt that the R&A was being " pressured " to negotiate a more lucrative broadcast deal , as the other three majors have in the United States , but also argued that viewer interest in golf could face further declines in the UK without widely available coverage .
On 3 February 2015 , the R&A announced that Sky Sports had acquired broadcast rights to the Open beginning in 2017 , under a five - year contract valued at £ 15 million per - year , doubling the value of the previous BBC contract .
As required by broadcasting regulations , rights to broadcast a nightly highlights programme were also sold : the BBC acquired this highlights package .
Dawson praised Sky Sports ' past involvement with televised golf , explaining that " the way people consume live sport is changing significantly and this new agreement ensures fans have a range of options for enjoying the championship on television and through digital channels " .
The BBC chose to opt out of the final year of its existing contract , making Sky Sports ' broadcast rights begin one year early , in 2016 .
UNITED STATES Section::::United States .
In the United States , ABC had historically held rights to the Open .
Beginning in 2010 under an eight - year agreement , the Open moved exclusively to ABC 's sister pay television channel ESPN , with only tape - delayed highlights shown on ABC .
In June 2015 , it was announced that NBC Sports would acquire rights to the Open Championship under a 12-year deal beginning in 2017 ; early round coverage airs on Golf Channel , with the main NBC network broadcasting live weekend coverage .
The R&A cited NBC 's successful broadcasts of Premier League football , which also primarily airs on weekend mornings in U.S. time zones , as an advantage of NBC 's acquisition of The Open .
Similarly to the BBC , ESPN chose to opt out of its final year of Open rights , causing NBC 's rights to begin in 2016 instead .
NBC promoted plans to provide 140 hours of coverage for the Open , including ancillary programming throughout tournament week on Golf Channel , and 49-and - a - half hours of broadcasts of the tournament itself .
