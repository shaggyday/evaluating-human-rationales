FORMAT Section::::Format .
Love Island involves a group of contestants , referred to as Islanders , living in isolation from the outside world in a villa in Mallorca , Spain , constantly under video surveillance .
To survive in the villa the Islanders must be coupled up with another Islander , whether it be for love , friendship or money , as the overall winning couple receives $ 50,000 .
On the first day , the Islanders couple up for the first time based on first impressions , but over the duration of the series , they are forced to " re - couple " where they can choose to remain in their current couple or swap and change .
Any Islander who remains single after the coupling is eliminated and dumped from the island .
Islanders can also be eliminated via public vote , as during the series the public vote through the Love Island app available on smartphones for their favourite couple , or who they think is the most compatible .
Couples who receive the fewest votes risk being eliminated .
Often a twist has occurred where it has been up to the Islanders to vote one of their own off the island .
During the final week , the public vote for which couple they want to win the series and therefore take home $ 50,000 .
