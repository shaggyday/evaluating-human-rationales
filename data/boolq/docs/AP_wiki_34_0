NATIONAL PARK SERVICE
The National Park Service ( NPS ) is an agency of the United States federal government that manages all national parks , many national monuments , and other conservation and historical properties with various title designations .
It was created on August 25 , 1916 , by Congress through the National Park Service Organic Act and is an agency of the United States Department of the Interior .
The NPS is charged with a dual role of preserving the ecological and historical integrity of the places entrusted to its management , while also making them available and accessible for public use and enjoyment . , the NPS employs approximately 27,000 employees who oversee units , of which 60 are designated national parks .
HISTORY Section::::History .
National parks and national monuments in the United States were originally individually managed under the auspices of the Department of the Interior .
The movement for an independent agency to oversee these federal lands was spearheaded by business magnate and conservationist Stephen Mather , as well as J. Horace McFarland .
With the help of journalist Robert Sterling Yard , Mather ran a publicity campaign for the Department of the Interior .
They wrote numerous articles that praised the scenic and historic qualities of the parks and their possibilities for educational , inspirational , and recreational benefits .
This campaign resulted in the creation of a National Park Service .
On August 25 , 1916 , President Woodrow Wilson signed a bill that mandated the agency " to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein , and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations .
" Mather became the first director of the newly formed NPS .
On March 3 , 1933 , President Herbert Hoover signed the Reorganization Act of 1933 .
The act would allow the President to reorganize the executive branch of the United States government .
It was n't until later that summer when the new President , Franklin D. Roosevelt , made use of this power .
Deputy Director Horace M. Albright had suggested to President Roosevelt that the historic sites from the American Civil War should be managed by the National Park Service , rather than the War Department .
President Roosevelt agreed and issued two Executive orders to make it happen .
These two executive orders not only transferred to the National Park Service all the War Department historic sites , but also the national monuments managed by the Department of Agriculture and the parks in and around the capital , which had been run by an independent office .
In 1951 , Conrad Wirth became director of the National Park Service and went to work on bringing park facilities up to the standards that the public expected .
The demand for parks after the end of the World War II had left the parks overburdened with demands that could not be met .
In 1952 , with the support of President Dwight D. Eisenhower , he began Mission 66 , a ten - year effort to upgrade and expand park facilities for the 50th anniversary of the Park Service .
New parks were added to preserve unique resources and existing park facilities were upgraded and expanded .
In 1966 , as the Park Service turned 50 years old , emphasis began to turn from just saving great and wonderful scenery and unique natural features to making parks accessible to the public .
Director George Hartzog began the process with the creation of the National Lakeshores and then National Recreation Areas .
NATIONAL PARK SERVICE Section::::National Park Service .
Since its inception in 1916 , the National Park Service has managed each of the United States ' national parks , which have grown in number over the years to 60 .
Yellowstone National Park was the first national park in the United States .
In 1872 , there was no state government to manage it , so the federal government assumed direct control .
Yosemite National Park began as a state park ; the land for the park was donated by the federal government to the state of California in 1864 for perpetual conservation .
Yosemite was later returned to federal ownership .
At first , each national park was managed independently , with varying degrees of success .
In Yellowstone , the civilian staff was replaced by the U.S. Army in 1886 .
Due to the irregularities in managing these national treasures , Stephen Mather petitioned the federal government to improve the situation .
In response , Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane challenged him to lobby for creating a new agency , the National Park Service , to manage all national parks and some national monuments .
Mather was successful with the ratification of the National Park Service Organic Act in 1916 .
Later , the agency was given authority over other protected areas , many with varying designations as Congress created them .

End NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM Section::::National Park System .
The National Park System ( NPS ) includes all properties managed by the National Park Service ( also , confusingly , " NPS " ) .
The title or designation of a unit need not include the term park ; indeed , most do not .
The System as a whole is considered to be a national treasure of the United States , and some of the more famous national parks and monuments are sometimes referred to metaphorically as " crown jewels " .
The system encompasses approximately 84.4 million acres ( 338,000 km² ) , of which more than 4.3 million acres ( 17,000 km² ) remain in private ownership .
The largest unit is Wrangell - St .
Elias National Park and Preserve , Alaska .
At 13,200,000 acres ( 53,000 km² ) , it is over 16 percent of the entire system .
The smallest unit in the system is Thaddeus Kosciuszko National Memorial , Pennsylvania , at 0.02 acre ( 80 m² ) .
In addition to administering its units and other properties , the National Park Service also provides technical and financial assistance to several " affiliated areas " authorized by Congress .
The largest affiliated area is New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve at 1,164,025 acres ( 4711 km² ) .
The smallest is Benjamin Franklin National Memorial at less than .
Although all units of the National Park System in the United States are the responsibility of a single agency , they are all managed under individual pieces of authorizing legislation or , in the case of national monuments created under the Antiquities Act , presidential proclamation .
For example , because of provisions within their enabling legislation , Congaree National Park is almost entirely wilderness area devoid of development , yet Yosemite allows unique developments such as the Badger Pass Ski Area and the O'Shaughnessy Dam within its boundaries .
Death Valley National Park has an active mine legislated within its boundaries .
Such irregularities would not be found in other parks unless specifically provided for with exceptions by the legislation that created them .
HOLDINGS Section::::Holdings .
For current specifics and a multitude of information , see the Quick Facts section of the NPS website . !

Amount CRITERIA Section::::Criteria .
Most units of the National Park Service have been established by an act of Congress , with the president confirming the action by signing the act into law .
The exception , under the Antiquities Act , allows the president to designate and protect areas as National Monuments by executive order .
Regardless of the method used , all parks are to be of national importance .
A potential park should meet all four of the following standards :
*
It is an outstanding example of a particular type of resource .
*
It possesses exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the natural or cultural themes of our Nation 's heritage .
*
It offers superlative opportunities for recreation , for public use and enjoyment , or for scientific study .
*
It retains a high degree of integrity as a true , accurate , and relatively unspoiled example of the resource .

Controversy
Regarding Accessibility
On October 24 , 2017 , Secretary of the Interior Zinke proposed large fee hikes at seventeen of the most visited national parks in order to address a backlog of maintenance at all national parks .
The National Park Service felt that these changes , which would increase entrance fees from $ 25 to $ 75 , were appropriate because they only targeted the most popular parks , which already have entrance fees .
However , there was a nearly unanimous public backlash against this proposal ; many families felt this would prohibit them from being able to visit the parks .
Further , there was concern that this hike would disproportionately affect low - income families , who are already underrepresented in visitation to national parks .
Additionally , many organizations working to increase access to nature for families of color , such as Latino Outdoors and African American Nature and Parks Experience , spoke out against these proposed fee hikes .
Altogether , more than 110,000 comments were posted on the National Park Service website , with 98 % of them protesting this change .
Representative Raul Grijalva commented , " This is a prime example that activism works . "
In response to this strong public reaction , on April 12 , 2018 , Secretary Zinke released a statement replacing this plan with a more moderate proposal to raise prices incrementally across all parks with entrance fees .
CONCESSIONS Section::::Concessions .
In an effort to increase visitation and allow for a larger audience to enjoy national park land , the National Park Service has numerous concession contracts with private businesses to bring recreation , resorts and other compatible amenities to their parks .
NPS lodging opportunities exist at places such as the Wawona Hotel in Yosemite National Park and the Fort Baker Retreat and Conference Center in Golden Gate National Recreation Area .
Adaptive reuses like those at Fort Baker , have raised some controversy from concerns about the historical integrity of these buildings , after extensive renovations and whether such alterations fall within the spirit and/or the letter of the preservation laws they are protected by .
* Delaware North Corporation at Yosemite National Park , Yellowstone National Park , South Rim Grand Canyon National Park .
* Forever Resorts at Big Bend National Park , Blue Ridge Parkway , Badlands National Park , North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park , Olympic National Park , Lake Mead National Recreation Area , Mammoth Cave National Park , Isle Royale National Park , and Rocky Mountain National Park .
* Xanterra Parks & Resorts at Bryce Canyon National Park , Crater Lake National Park , Death Valley National Park , South Rim Grand Canyon National Park , Mount Rushmore National Memorial , Painted Desert at Petrified Forest National Park , Yellowstone National Park , and Zion National Park .
LITIGATION WITH DELAWARE NORTH Section::::Litigation with Delaware North .
In 2015 , Delaware North sued the NPS in the United States Court of Claims for breach of contract , alleging that the NPS had undervalued its trademarks of the names of iconic Yosemite National Park concession facilities .
When it offered for bid the contract to operate these facilities , the National Park Service estimated the value of the intangible assets including the names " Ahwahnee , " " Badger Pass , " " Curry Village , " and " Yosemite Lodge " at $ 3.5 million .
Delaware North lost the contract , and asserted that the historic names were worth $ 51 million and maintained that the incoming concessioner had to be paid that amount .
The Justice Department and the NPS asserted that this was an " improper and wildly inflated " value .
Rather than pay Delaware North 's demanded valuation , in January 2016 the NPS instead opted to rename the famous landmarks , effective in March .
The Ahwahnee Hotel is slated to become The Majestic Yosemite Hotel , Curry Village will become Half Dome Village , and the Wawona Hotel will become Big Trees Lodge .
Widespread public outcry focused on Delaware North 's decision to claim ownership of names within a national park .

Jurisdiction is set by the enabling legislation for each individual unit of the NPS and is considered part of the Special Maritime and Territorial Jurisdiction of the United States .
Law enforcement on NPS lands with exclusive jurisdiction is solely conducted by NPS Law Enforcement Rangers ( field officers ) or the US Park Police .
Many NPS units have concurrent jurisdiction and share law enforcement authority with their state and/or local county law enforcement agencies .
Some National Park Service units have proprietary or partial jurisdiction where law enforcement authority for certain serious incidents lies with the state or county .
Most NPS units have memorandums of understanding with outside law enforcement agencies , so that policies are in place when and if outside agency assistance is needed .
LAW ENFORCEMENT RANGERS Section::::Law Enforcement Rangers .
Uniformed Law Enforcement Rangers , Park Police Officers and Special Agents enforce Federal laws and regulations governing NPS lands and resources .
These personnel can also enforce some or all state laws on NPS lands .
As part of that mission , LEOs carry firearms , defensive equipment , make arrests , execute search warrants , complete reports and testify in court .
They establish a regular and recurring presence on a vast amount of public lands , roads , and recreation sites .
The primary focus of their jobs is the protection of natural resources , protection of NPS employees and the protection of visitors .
To cover the vast and varied terrain under their jurisdiction , NPS employees use numerous types of vehicles , horses , aircraft , UTV / ATV 's , snowmobiles , dirt bikes and boats .
SPECIAL AGENTS Section::::Special Agents .
Special Agents are criminal investigators who plan and conduct investigations as part of the Investigative Services Branch ( ISB ) concerning possible violations of criminal and administrative provisions of the NPS and other statues under the United States Code and/or Code of Federal Regulations .
Special agents can be uniformed or plain clothes officers .
Special Agents often carry concealed firearms , and other defensive equipment , make arrests , carry out complex criminal investigations , present cases for prosecution to U.S. Attorneys , and prepare investigative reports .
Field agents travel a great deal and typically cover several NPS units and several states .
Criminal investigators occasionally conduct internal and civil claim investigations .
LAWS ENFORCED Section::::Laws enforced .
Generally speaking the laws enforced on NPS lands are covered in Title 36 Code of Federal Regulations .
The NPS also enforces United States Code .
Title 16 of the United States Code , Title 18 of the United States Code and Title 21 of the United States Code are enforced most commonly .
The National Park Service generally also has the authority to enforce any state law not covered already by federal laws under the Assimilative Crimes Act , 18 U.S.C. § 13 .
However , by policy the National Park Service can not charge violators with a state offense that has a harsher penalty than an equivalent federal law already on the books .
Commissioned National Park Service employees must follow all policies outlined in DOI reference manuals and directors orders in performance of their duties .
UNITED STATES PARK
POLICE Section::::United States Park Police .
The United States Park Police ( USPP ) is the oldest uniformed federal law enforcement agency in the United States .
It functions as a full service law enforcement agency with responsibilities and jurisdiction in those National Park Service areas primarily located in the Washington , D.C. , San Francisco , and New York City areas .
In addition to performing the normal crime prevention , investigation , and apprehension functions of an urban police force , the Park Police are responsible for policing many of the famous monuments in the United States and share law enforcement jurisdiction in all lands administered by the Service with a force of National Park Rangers tasked with the same law enforcement powers and responsibilities .
SPECIAL DIVISIONS
Section::::Special divisions .
Other special NPS divisions include the Archeology Program , Historic American Buildings Survey , National Register of Historic Places , National Natural Landmarks , the Rivers , Trails and Conservation Assistance Program , the Challenge Cost Share Program , the Federal Lands to Parks , the Hydropower Relicensing Program , the Land and Water Conservation Fund , the National Trails System , the Partnership Wild and Scenic Rivers Program , and the Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division .
Centers
The National Park Service operates four archeology - related centers : Harpers Ferry Center in Harpers Ferry , West Virginia , the Midwest Archeological Center in Lincoln , Nebraska , the Southeast Archeological Center in Tallahassee , Florida and the Western Archeological and Conservation Center in Tucson , Arizona .
The Harpers Ferry Center specializes in interpretive media development and object conservation .
The other three focus to various degrees on archaeological research and museum object curation and conservation .
National Park Service training centers include : Horace Albright Training Center , Grand Canyon ; Stephen Mather Training Center , Harpers Ferry , West Virginia ; Historic Preservation Training Center , Frederick , Maryland and Capital Training Center , Washington ,
D.C. The Submerged Resources Center is the unit responsible for inventory and evaluation of submerged resources throughout the National Park system .
The SRC is based out of the Intermountain Region 's headquarters in Lakewood , Colorado .
The National Center for Preservation Technology and Training , located in Natchitoches , Louisiana , conducts research and training in the fields of archeology , architecture , landscape architecture and materials conservation .
Preservation programs ( HABS / HAER )
The oldest federal preservation program , the Historic American Buildings Survey / Historic American Engineering Record ( HABS / HAER ) , produces graphic and written documentation of historically significant architectural , engineering and industrial sites and structures .
Dating from 1934 , the Historic American Buildings Survey ( HABS ) was chartered to document historic architecture — primarily houses and public buildings — of national or regional significance .
Originally a New Deal employment / preservation program , after World War II , HABS employed summer teams of advanced undergraduate and graduate students to carry out the documentation , a tradition followed to this day .
Many of the structures they documented no longer exist .
HABS / HAER produces measured drawings , large - format photographs and written histories of historic sites , structures and objects , that are significant to the architectural , engineering and industrial heritage of the U.S.
Its 25,000 records are part of the Library of Congress .
HABS / HAER is administered by the NPS Washington office and five regional offices .
Historic American Buildings SurveyIn 1933 , the National Park Service , Department of the Interior , established the Historic American Buildings Survey ( HABS ) , based on a proposal by Charles E. Peterson , Park Service landscape architect .
It was founded as a make - work program for architects , draftsmen and photographers left jobless by the Great Depression .
Guided by field instructions from Washington , D.C. , the first recorders were tasked with documenting a representative sampling of America 's architectural heritage .
After 70 years , there is now an archive of historic architecture .
HABS provided a database of primary source material for the then fledgling historic preservation movement .
Historic American Engineering RecordRecognizing a similar fragility in our national industrial and engineering heritage , the National Park Service , the Library of Congress and the American Society of Civil Engineers ( ASCE ) formed the HAER program in 1969 , to document nationally and regionally significant engineering and industrial sites .
A short while later , HAER was ratified by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers ( ASME ) , the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers ( IEEE ) , the American Institute of Chemical Engineers ( AIChE ) and the American Institute of Mining , Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers ( AIME ) .
HAER documentation , in the forms of measured and interpretive drawings , large - format photographs and written histories , is archivally preserved in the Prints and Photographs Division of the Library of Congress , where it is readily available to the public .
Rivers , Trails and Conservation Assistance
ProgramThe RTCA program of the National Park Service is designed to assist local communities and the public in preservation of rivers , trails and greenways .
Unlike the mainline National Park Programs , these programs take place on non - federal property at the request of the local community .
One of their better known programs is Rails to Trails , where unused railroad right - of - ways are converted into public hiking and biking trails .
National Trails System
The National Trails System is a joint mission of the National Park Service , the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service .
It was created in 1968 to establish a system of long - distance National Scenic and National Historic Trails , as well as to recognize existing trails in the states as National Recreation Trails .
Several additional trails have been established since 1968 , and in 2009 Congress established the first National Geologic Trail .
National Heritage Areas National Heritage Areas are a unique blend of natural , cultural , historic , and scenic resources .
Having developed out of a shared historic , they create a unique whole .
Currently ( 2015 ) there are 49 designated heritage areas .
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS World Heritage Sites Section::::International affairs .
World Heritage Sites have enough universally recognized natural and cultural features that they are considered to merit the protection of all the peoples in the world .
The National Park Service is responsible for 16 of the 19 World Heritage Sites in the United States .
* Carlsbad Caverns National Park , New Mexico
* Chaco Culture National Historical Park , New Mexico
* Everglades National Park , Florida * Grand Canyon National Park , Arizona * Great Smoky Mountains National Park , Tennessee and North Carolina

* 24-hr
all Taxa BioBlitz :
A joint venture of the National Geographic Society and the National Park Service .
Beginning in 2004 , at Rock Creek Parkway , the National Geographic Society and the National Park Service began a 10-year program of hosting a major biological survey of ten selected national park units .
The intent is to develop public interest in the nations natural resources , develop scientific interest in America 's youth and to create citizen scientist .
* 2007 :
Rock Creek Park , Washington D.C.
661 species * 2008 : Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area , Los Angeles , California .
1,700 species and more pending .
* 2009 :
Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore , near Chicago in northern Indiana .
1,716 species and still counting .
* 2010 :
Biscayne National Park , Miami , Florida .
810 species were identified during this 24-hr event .
As classification continues , more species will be added to the list .
* 2011 :
Saguaro National Park , Tucson , Arizona .
During the 24-hours , 859 different species were identified , of which more than 400 were previously unknown in the park .
* 2012 : Rocky Mountain National Park , in Estes Park , In August 2012 489 species were identified .
* 2013 :
Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve , in New Orleans .
The BioBlitz will occur on May 17 and 18 , 2013 in the park 's Barataria Preserve .
* Biological Diversity : Biological Diversity is the vast variety of life as identified through species and genetics .
This variety is decreasing as people spread across the globe , altering areas to better meet their needs .
* Climate Change :
Warming of the climate system is unequivocal , as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures , widespread melting of snow and ice , and rising global sea levels .
( Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , 2007 ) .
* South Florida Restoration Initiative :
Rescuing an Ecosystem in Peril :
In partnership with the State of Florida , and the Army Corps of Engineers , the National Park Service is restoring the physical and biological processes of the South Florida ecosystem .
Historically , this ecosystem contained some of the most diverse habitats on earth .
* Vanishing Treasures Initiative :
Ruins Preservation in the American Southwest :
The Vanishing Treasures Initiative began in FY 1998 to reduce threats to prehistoric and historic sites and structures in 44 parks of the Intermountain Region .
In 2002 , the program expanded to include three parks in the Pacific West Region .
The goal is to reduce backlogged work and to bring sites and structures up to a condition where routine maintenance activities can preserve them .
*
Wetlands : Wetlands includes marshes , swamps , and bogs .
These areas and the plants and animals adapted to these conditions spread from the arctic to the equator .
The shrinking wetlands provide habitat for fish and wildlife , help clean water and reduce the impact of storms and floods on the surrounding communities .
* Wildland Fire : Fires have been a natural part of park eco - systems .
Many plants and some animals require a cycle of fire or flooding to be successful and productive .
With the advent of human intervention and public access to parks , there are safety concerns for the visiting public .
GREEN PARK PLAN Section::::Initiatives .
Section::::Green Park Plan .
In September 2010 , the NPS released its Climate Change Response Strategy , followed in April 2012 by the Green Parks Plan .
CLIMATE FRIENDLY PARKS PROGRAM Section::::Climate Friendly Parks Program .
The Climate Friendly Parks Program is a subset of the Green Parks plan .
It was created in collaboration between the National Park Service and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .
The program is meant to measure and reduce greenhouse gases to help slow the effects of climate change .
Parks in the CFP program create and implement plans to reduce greenhouse gases through reducing energy and water use .
Facilities are designed and retrofitted using sustainable materials .
Alternative transportation systems are developed to reduce dependency on fossil fuels .
Parks in the program offer public education programs about how the parks are already affected .
The program provides climate friendly solutions to the visiting public , like using clean energy , reducing waste , and making smart transportation choices .
The CFP program can provide technical assistance , tools and resources for the parks and their neighboring communities to protect the natural and cultural resources .
The large , isolated parks typically generate their own electricity and heat and must do so without spoiling the values that the visitors have come to experience .
Pollution is emitted by the vehicles used to transport visitors around the often - vast expanses of the parks .
Many parks have converted vehicles to electric hybrids , and substitute diesel / electric hybrid buses for private automobiles .
In 2001 it was estimated that replacement with electric vehicles would eliminate 25 TPY emissions entirely .
In 2010 , the National Park Service estimated that reducing bottled water could eliminate 6,000 tons of carbon emissions and 8 million kilowatt hours of electricity every year .
The NPS Concessions office voiced concerns about concessions impacts .
By 2014 , 23 parks had banned disposable water bottles .
In 2015 , the International Bottled Water Association stated the NPS was " leaving sugary drinks as a primary alternative " , even though the Park Service provides water stations to refill bottles , " encouraging visitors to hydrate for free .
"
The Water Association made the national parks one of its top lobbying targets and in July 2015
Rep. Keith Rothfus added a " last - minute " amendment into Congress 's appropriations bill , blocking the National Park Service from funding or enforcing the program .
The National Park Service discontinued its ban on disposable water bottles in August 2017 .
