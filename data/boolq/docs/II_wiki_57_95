PRODUCTION
Section::::Production .
The brothers Vegard and Bård Ylvisåker , members of the Norwegian comedy group Ylvis , produced the song and music video " The Fox " to promote their upcoming third season of I kveld med Ylvis on TVNorge .
In an interview with Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten , the brothers stated that the idea of a song about a fox was originally conceived in 2012 , but then shelved .
Half a year later , in 2013 , Bård and lyricist Christian Løchstøer began to play with the idea once again .
Vegard was initially skeptical about making a song about a fox , but soon relented .
In an interview on the Norwegian - Swedish talk show Skavlan , the brothers mentioned that given the opportunity to collaborate with Stargate , they originally wanted to make a dance song about men who can not dance or dread dancing and named it " The Dancing Stick " , but felt that the idea was " too clever " , and that they would appear to be trying to make a hit .
The idea was therefore scrapped and " The Fox " got produced instead .
Bård described the writing process for " The Fox " in an interview with Billboard in the United States : " The way we work is we just sit around and talk about things and get ideas and take some notes .
I guess we must have been talking about what sound a fox makes .
And then we had a chance to work with Stargate , a Norwegian production company based in New York City ...
We actually did a favor for them and we asked them if they could produce a song for the new season in exchange " .
Tor Erik Hermansen of Stargate recalled in an interview with Spin that the favor was actually a mockumentary done by the Ylvisåker brothers to celebrate Mikkel Storleer Eriksen 40th birthday , in which they pretended to be the Stargate duo .
Australian producer M4SONIC was also involved in the production .
Bård , being interviewed by Entertainment Weekly , talked about their intention of making " The Fox " : M4SONIC described producing " The Fox " : MUSIC VIDEO AND COMPOSITION Section::::Music video and composition .
The video was released on 3 September 2013 .
It is performed in the style of a typical electronic dance pop song , and the lyrics are sung " with deadpan seriousness " .
The video was originally created to promote the brand - new season of Ylvis ' talk show I kveld med Ylvis on TVNorge but after being released on the TVNorge YouTube channel went viral .
The video was directed by Ole Martin Hafsmo with cinematography by Magnus Flåto .
The choreography was done by Thea Bay .
The video is produced by Fredrik Kvåle Dørum and Jørgen Thue ( Concorde TV ) .
The forest scenes were filmed in Nittedal municipality , from Oslo downtown .
The video begins with Bård singing at a costume party where other participants are dressed as different animals , whose appearances follow the progression of the lyrics .
He gives a summary of animal sounds ( " Dog goes woof / cat goes meow " ,
etc . )
that " could have been lifted straight from a preschool primer " and asks " what does the fox say ?
" The group then transitions into a synchronized dance scene in a forest with Bård in a bear costume and Vegard a squirrel costume ( as they failed to find any fox costume in the Norwegian Film Institute the day before filming to make up for their melted spray - painted plastic costumes ) , complete with face - paint and giant , bushy tails .
During each chorus , the song offers several increasingly absurd possibilities for the fox 's sound such as " gering - ding - ding - ding - dingeringeding ! "
and in the second chorus where Vegard sings " fraka - kaka - kaka - kaka - kow ! "
Among the dancers , an elderly man ( Bernhard Ramstad ) is shown reading the lyrics from a book to a boy sitting on his lap .
The song then describes the fox and the singer 's admiration for it , and asks whether it would communicate with a horse using morse code .
In the end , the singers float in the air , continuing to wonder what sound the fox makes , while failing to notice a computer - animated fox behind them , which stands on its hind legs and scat sings ( voiced by Vegard ) , answering their question .
Bård finishes the song with a melancholy falsetto and the fox leaves without being seen .
With the chord progression of C♯m — B — F♯ , the song is written in the key of C♯ dorian , with lead vocal range spanning from C♯3 to F♯5 .

ANALYSIS Section::::Analysis .
Tris McCall of The Star - Ledger describes " The Fox " as " a parody of the excesses and absurdities of contemporary club music " : the brothers " take turns singing preposterous lyrics about animal noises " over " typically vainglorious synthpop " , with the proposed fox sounds " mimic[king ] the car - alarm synthesizers of contemporary dubstep " .
He compares it to Ylvis ' " Someone Like Me " which mocked the insertion of dubstep breaks into pop songs .
Danielle Seamon of The Lantern acknowledges that while some may be " extremely perplexed by the attention stupidity and bizarreness collects in 2013 " displayed by the song , it is in fact " meant to be a funny and almost satirical to pop music " , and Ylvis has " pushed everybody 's buttons by breaking and manipulating every rule of a Top 40 pop song " .
Evan Sawdey of PopMatters , who names " The Fox " one of the best songs of the year , calls it " a concept that 's so stupid
it 's smart " by bending " the very fabric of pop culture in such a memorable , ridiculous way " with simple lines of " utter comic brilliance " .
Caitlin Carter of online music site Music Times echoes the comments above , adding that " The Fox " becoming the first song to get serious recognition " makes [ the staff at Music Times ] wonder " , as the duo 's other songs and videos prior to the release of " The Fox " " are just about as random and melodramatic " , such as " from contemplating the meaning of Stonehenge " ( ' Stonehenge ' ) , to scientifically examining the inner - workings of the female reproductive organ ( ' Work It ' ) , to honoring a United Nations Human Rights hero ( ' Jan Egeland ' ) .
"
Jonathan Ore of CBC News , although calling " The Fox " a " catchy tune [ ... ] paired with the most absurd lyrics this side of the theme song to DuckTales " , also gives the comedy duo credit for " the arguably better " " Stonehenge " .
Both brothers have commented on the " absurdity " of " The Fox " .
Bård called the song " a stupid thing " and that " even though people find it interesting , it 's still a stupid fox song , and when people start to get over this , it gets even worse , because it is so stupid " .
In response to the negative feedback of the song , Vegard has made the following remark : Speaking of the meaning of the song , Vegard characterizes it as coming from " a genuine wonder of what the fox says , because we did n't know " .
Although interpreted by some commentators as a reference to the furry fandom , the brothers have stated they did not know about its existence when producing " The Fox " .
