However , he never had a game without an interception , bringing his 8-game TD – INT ratio to 9–13 , and the Broncos needed a hardworking defense to contribute for victories .
In Week 10 , in the second divisional game against Kansas City , the game 's biggest highlight was Manning breaking Brett Favre 's record for career passing yards with a four - yard pass to running back Ronnie Hillman in the first quarter .
Despite the accomplishment , however , Manning went 5-for-20 for 35 yards and four interceptions with a 0.0 passer rating before head coach Gary Kubiak benched him during the third quarter .
Brock Osweiler filled in for Manning for the rest of the game as the Broncos lost 29–13 .
A day later , sources said that Manning had suffered a bout of plantar fasciitis .
It was later announced that this injury would keep him out of Week 11 , marking the first time Peyton had missed a game in a season he played .
Osweiler replaced Manning and performed well in a 17–15 win over the Chicago Bears , leading to questions about whether Manning would retain his role when healthy in a Week 12 showdown against the New England Patriots .
The next day , head coach Gary Kubiak , citing Manning 's injuries , announced that Osweiler would start against New England .
On December 15 , it was announced that Osweiler would make his fifth consecutive start , against the Pittsburgh Steelers , even though Manning had returned to practice and the Broncos had gone seven straight quarters without scoring a touchdown on offense .
Overall , the Broncos went 4–2 in six games without Manning , giving them an 11–4 record heading into the final week of the regular season .
On December 27 , 2015 , Al Jazeera America released conducted by the Al Jazeera Investigative Unit investigating professional athletes ' use of Performance - enhancing drugs ( PEDs ) which named Manning , among other prominent athletes , as having received illegal drugs from Charles Sly , a pharmacist who had worked at the Guyer Anti - Aging Clinic in Indianapolis during the fall of 2011 .
In July 2016 , the NFL cleared Manning of the allegations and announced that it had found no evidence to support the claims .
Manning was listed as active for the Week 17 regular season finale against the San Diego Chargers , but for the first time since his freshman year at college , he was listed as a backup .
In the third quarter , with the Broncos down 13–7 , Manning entered the game in relief of Osweiler , who had been intercepted twice and fumbled once .
The Broncos went on to beat the Chargers , 27–20 , and secure the AFC West and the top seed in the AFC .
Despite the Broncos ' 12–4 record ( and Manning 's 8–2 record in games that he played in ) , Manning had the worst season statistically of his career , as he threw a career - low nine touchdown passes and 17 interceptions in just 10 games , and posting a quarterback rating of 67.9 , the lowest rating of his career , and first time he had a rating below 84 since his rookie season .
Manning 's 59.8 completion percentage was the second lowest of his career , only behind his rookie season .
Manning 's 17 interceptions were second to Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles , who threw 18 interceptions but started all 16 games .
The Broncos , by virtue of having the AFC 's # 1 seed , earned home field advantage throughout the NFL playoffs .
The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Divisional Round to advance to the AFC Championship game to host the defending Super Bowl champions , the New England Patriots .
Manning was 21-of-37 for 222 with no touchdowns or interceptions .
It was the 17th , and ultimately final , meeting between Manning and his longtime rival Tom Brady .
Despite a late comeback attempt from the Patriots , the Broncos won 20–18 to advance to Super Bowl 50 .
Manning threw for 176 passing yards , two touchdowns , and no interceptions in the win .
On February 7 , 2016 , the Broncos defeated the Carolina Panthers 24–10 in Super Bowl 50 as the Broncos ' defense shut down the heavily favored Panthers ' top - ranked offense and regular season MVP Cam Newton .
Manning finished the game 13-of-23 for 141 yards with one interception while being sacked five times , scoring his only passing points with 3:08 left in the fourth quarter when he connected with wide receiver Bennie Fowler for a two - point conversion , which ended up being the final pass of his career .
Manning became the oldest starting quarterback to both play in and win a Super Bowl .
Manning also became the first quarterback to start two Super Bowls with multiple franchises , with different head coaches each time ( Dungy , Caldwell , Fox , and Kubiak ) and the first quarterback to lead two franchises to a Super Bowl victory .
The victory gave Manning his 200th overall win including regular season and playoffs , making him at the time the starting quarterback with the most combined regular season and postseason wins in NFL history .
" THE MANNING BOWL " Section::::"The Manning Bowl " .
Peyton and Eli Manning played against each other three times in their professional careers , not counting Pro Bowls or the preseason .
These encounters were colloquially dubbed " The Manning Bowl " , and Peyton 's teams ( twice with the Colts , once with the Broncos ) held a 3–0 record over Eli 's team ( three games with the New York Giants ) .
The first Manning Bowl was held on September 10 , 2006 , and Peyton 's Colts defeated Eli 's Giants by a score of 26–21 .

PERSONAL LIFE Section::::Personal life .
Manning was born in New Orleans , Louisiana , the son of Olivia ( née Williams ) and former NFL quarterback Archie Manning .
He is the brother of two - time Super Bowl Champion , Eli Manning .
Some have described the Mannings as football 's " royal family " .
Manning married his wife , Ashley , in Memphis on St. Patrick 's Day , 2001 .
A graduate of the University of Virginia , Ashley was introduced to him by her parents ' next - door neighbor the summer before Manning 's freshman year in college .
Peyton and wife Ashley have twins , a son , Marshal Williams , and a daughter , Mosley Thompson , born on March 31 , 2011 .
Manning is a Christian .
At age 13 , he said , " I committed my life to Christ , and that faith has been most important to me ever since . "
Manning said his priorities ranked in order are " ... faith , family , friends , and football . "
Manning said he prays every night and before games and added , " I hope ( and pray )
I do n't do too many things that displease Him before I get to Heaven myself .
I believe , too , that life is much better and freer when you 're committed to God in that way . "
Manning reportedly memorized the Colts ' playbook within a week after being drafted , and in 2012 was able to precisely recall the details and timing of a specific play he had used at Tennessee 16 years earlier .
During the summer , Archie , Peyton , Eli , and eldest sibling Cooper run the Manning Passing Academy , a five - day camp which aims to improve the offensive skills of quarterbacks , wide receivers , tight ends , and running backs .
In addition to the Mannings , the camp has included many prominent players from football as coaches , such as Colts wide receivers Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne .
Manning , along with his father Archie , co - authored a book titled , Manning :
A Father , His Sons , and a Football Legacy , which was released in 2000 .
The book covers Archie 's and Cooper 's lives and careers , and Manning 's life and career up to the time that the book was released , and examines football from both Archie 's and Manning 's points - of - view .
Manning wrote about Jamie Ann Naughright , who had accused him of sexual harassment , stating that she had a " vulgar mouth " .
He described his conduct towards her as " crude , maybe , but harmless " .
The trainer sued for defamation , resulting in an undisclosed settlement in 2003 and a court - ordered gag on Manning and Naughright from ever talking about the settlement or each other again .
Mark Kiszla , a sports columnist for the Denver Post , in a column about Manning 's future plans , said that Manning 's net worth " is estimated to be in excess of $ 150 million " and " That 's not enough money to buy an NFL franchise by himself , although an ownership group that included Manning as president with a financial stake in the team would be led by a brilliant football mind . "
He has donated over $ 8,000 to Republican politicians , among them Fred Thompson , Bob Corker and former President George W. Bush .
During the 2016 presidential race , Manning contributed to the campaign of Jeb Bush .
On October 26 , 2012 , Manning purchased 21 Papa John 's Pizza stores , all in Colorado .
He sold his stakes in the stores in February 2018 .
