TAHR
Tahrs are species of large Asian artiodactyl ungulates related to the wild goat .
Until recently the three species were believed to be closely related and were placed in a single genus , Hemitragus .
Genetic studies have proven that the three tahrs are not as closely related as previously thought .
Now they are considered as members of three separate monotypic genera ; Hemitragus is now reserved for the Himalayan Tahr ; Nilgiritragus for the Nilgiri Tahr ; and Arabitragus for the Arabian Tahr .
RANGES Section::::Ranges .
While the Arabian Tahr of Oman and the Nilgiri Tahr of South India both have small ranges and are considered endangered , the Himalayan Tahr remains relatively widespread in the Himalayas , and has been introduced to the Southern Alps of New Zealand where it is hunted recreationally .
There is also a population on Table Mountain in South Africa , descended from a pair of tahrs which escaped from a zoo in 1936 , but most of these have been culled .
BEHAVIOR Section::::Behavior .
A routine of feeding during the morning followed by a long rest period , then feeding in the evening , constitutes the tahrs daily routine .
Tahrs are not generally active or feed at night and can be found at the same location morning and evening .
