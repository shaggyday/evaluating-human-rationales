NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR
The New Zealand dollar ( sign : $ ; code : NZD , also abbreviated NZ$ )
( ) is the official currency and legal tender of New Zealand , the Cook Islands , Niue , the Ross Dependency , Tokelau , and a British territory , the Pitcairn Islands .
Within New Zealand , it is almost always abbreviated with the dollar sign ( $ ) , with " NZ$ " sometimes used to distinguish it from other dollar - denominated currencies .
In the context of currency trading , it is often informally called the " Kiwi " or " Kiwi dollar " , since New Zealand is commonly associated with the indigenous bird and the one - dollar coin depicts a kiwi .
Introduced in 1967 , the dollar is subdivided into 100 cents .
Altogether there are ten denominations — five coins and five banknotes — with the smallest being the 10-cent coin .
Formerly there were lower denominations , but those were discontinued due to inflation and production costs .
The New Zealand dollar is consistently one of the 10 most traded currencies in the world , being approximately 2.0 % of global foreign exchange market daily turnover in 2013 .
HISTORY INTRODUCTION Section::::History .
Section::::Introduction .
Prior to the introduction of the New Zealand dollar in 1967 , the New Zealand pound was the currency of New Zealand , which had been distinct from the pound sterling since 1933 .
The pound used the £ sd system , in which the pound was divided into 20 shillings and one shilling was divided into 12 pence , which by the 1950s was considered complicated and cumbersome .
Switching to decimal currency had been proposed in New Zealand since the 1930s , although only in the 1950s did any plans come to fruition .
In 1957 , a committee was set up by the Government to investigate decimal currency .
The idea fell on fertile ground , and in 1963 , the Government decided to decimalise New Zealand currency .
The Decimal Currency Act was passed in 1964 , setting the date of transition to 10 July 1967 .
Words such as " fern " , " kiwi " and " zeal " were proposed to avoid confusion with the word " dollar " , which many people at the time associated with the United States dollar .
In the end , the word " dollar " was chosen anyway , and an anthropomorphic dollar note cartoon character called " Mr. Dollar " became the symbol of transition in a huge publicity campaign .
On Monday 10 July 1967 ( " Decimal Currency Day " ) , the New Zealand dollar was introduced to replace the pound at a rate of two dollars to one pound ( one dollar to ten shillings , ten cents to one shilling , cent to a penny ) .
Some 27 million new banknotes were printed and 165 million new coins were minted for the changeover .
EXCHANGE RATE Section::::Exchange rate .
The New Zealand dollar was initially pegged to the US dollar at US$ 1.43 = NZ$1 .
This rate changed on 21 November of the same year to US$ 1.12 = NZ$1 after the devaluation of the British pound ( see Bretton Woods system ) , although New Zealand devalued more than the UK .
In 1971 the US devalued its dollar relative to gold , leading New Zealand on 23 December to peg its dollar at US$ 1.216 with a 4.5 % fluctuation range , keeping the same gold value .
From 9 July 1973 to 4 March 1985
the dollar 's value was determined from a trade - weighted basket of currencies .
The NZ$ was floated on 4 March 1985 at the initial rate of US$ 0.4444 .
Since then the dollar 's value has been determined by the financial markets , and has been in the range of about US$ 0.39 to 0.88 .
The dollar 's post - float low was US$ 0.3922 on 22 November 2000 , and it reached a post - float high on 9 July 2014 of US$ 0.8821 .
Much of this medium - term variation in the exchange rate has been attributed to differences in interest rates .
The New Zealand dollar 's value is often strongly affected by currency trading , and is among the 10 most - traded currencies .
On 11 June 2007
the Reserve Bank sold an unknown worth of New Zealand dollars for nine billion USD in an attempt to drive down its value .
This is the first intervention in the markets by the Bank since the float in 1985 .
Two suspected interventions followed , but they were not as successful as the first : the first appeared to be initially effective , with the dollar dropping to approximately US$ 0.7490 from near US$ 0.7620 .
However , within little more than a month it had risen to new post - float highs , reaching US$ 0.8103 on 23 July 2007 .
After reaching its post - float record high in early 2008 , the value of the NZ$ plummeted throughout much of the 2nd half of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 as a response to the global economic downturn and flight by investors away from " riskier " currencies such as the NZ$.
The NZ$ bottomed out at approximately US$ 0.50 on 6 March 2009 .
However , it rebounded strongly as the year progressed , reaching the US$ 0.75 range by November 2009 .
By late 2012 , the dollar was holding above 80 US cents , occasionally reaching 85¢ , prompting calls from the Green Party for quantitative easing .
Unions also called on the Government and the Reserve Bank to take action , but as of February 2013 both had declined .
As of early June 2017 , the NZD was trading at approximately US$ 0.71 .
COINS HISTORY Section::::Coins .
Section::::History .
On the introduction of the dollar , coins came in denominations of 1c , 2c , 5c , 10c , 20c , and 50c .
The 1c and 2c coins were bronze , the others were cupro - nickel .
To ease transition , the 5c , 10c , and 20c were the same size as the sixpence , shilling and florin that they respectively replaced .
Until 1970 the ten - cent coin bore the additional legend " One Shilling " .
The obverse designs of all the coins featured Arnold Machin 's portrait of Queen Elizabeth II , with the legend ELIZABETH II NEW ZEALAND [ date ] .
The reverse sides of coins introduced in 1967 did not follow the designs that were originally intended for them .
Those modern art and sculpture themed designs were leaked to a newspaper and met a very negative public reaction .
The final releases were given more conservative designs in line with public expectations .
In 1986 , New Zealand adopted Raphael Maklouf 's new portrait of the Queen .
The 1c and 2c coins were last minted for circulation in 1987 , with collector coins being made for 1988 .
The coins were demonetised on 30 April 1990 .
The lack of 1c and 2c coins meant that cash transactions were normally rounded to the nearest 5c ( 10c from 2006 ) , a process known as Swedish rounding .
On 11 February 1991 , aluminium - bronze $ 1 and $ 2 coins were introduced to replace existing $ 1 and $ 2 notes .
In 1999 , Ian Rank - Broadley 's portrait of the Queen was introduced and the legend rearranged to read NEW ZEALAND ELIZABETH II .
On 11 November 2004
the Reserve Bank announced that it proposed to take the 5c coin out of circulation and to make the 50c , 20c and 10c coins smaller and use plated steel to make them lighter .
After a three - month public submission period that ended on 4 February 2005 , the Reserve Bank announced on 31 March that it would go ahead with the proposed changes .
The changeover period started on 31 July 2006 , with the old coins usable until 31 October 2006 .
The old 50c , 20c , 10c and 5c pieces are now no longer legal tender , but are still redeemable at the Reserve Bank .
Prior to the change over , these coins were similar , same for the legend and reverse artwork , to international ( mainly Commonwealth ) coins of the same British - derived sizes , which led to coins from other currencies , particularly older coins , being accepted by vending machines and many retailers .
On 23 March 2015 , the Reserve Bank of New Zealand issued its first commemorative circulating coin to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli landings .
The coin was also New Zealand 's first colour circulating coin .
1 million coins , with a denomination of 50c , were minted .
On 1 October 2018 the Reserve Bank of New Zealand issued its second commemorative circulating coin to mark the centenary of Armistice day .
The coin was also New Zealand 's second colour circulating coin .
2 million coins , with a denomination of 50c , were minted .

BANKNOTES HISTORY Section::::Banknotes .
Section::::History .
In 1967 , notes were introduced in denominations of $ 1 , $ 2 , $ 5 , $ 10 , $ 20 and $ 100 , with all except the $ 5 replacing their pound predecessors .
The original series of dollar notes featured on the obverse a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II wearing Queen Alexandra 's Kokoshnik tiara , King George 's VI festoon necklace , and Queen Mary 's floret earrings , while the reverse featured native birds and plants .
The notes were changed slightly in 1981 due to a change of printer ( from De La Rue to Bradbury , Wilkinson & Co.)—the most noticeable difference being the portrait based upon a photograph by Peter Grugeon , in which Queen Elizabeth II is wearing Grand Duchess Vladimir 's tiara and Queen Victoria 's golden jubilee necklace .
The $ 50 note was added in 1983 to fill the long gap between the $ 20 and the $ 100 notes .
$ 1 and $ 2 notes were discontinued in 1991 after being replaced with coins .
A new series of notes was introduced in 1992 .
The obverse of each note featured a notable New Zealander , while the reverse featured a native New Zealand bird and New Zealand scenery .
In 1999 , polymer notes replaced the paper notes .
The designs remained much the same , but were changed slightly to accommodate new security features , with the most obvious changes being the two transparent windows .
New banknotes are being printed in New Zealand at the moment .
The new notes are the same sizes and denominations as the older banknotes , and they will continue to be made of the same flexible plastic material .
The themes of the notes remain the same , with the same respected New Zealanders , the Queen , and flora and fauna remaining central to the designs .
The $ 5 and $ 10 notes were released in October 2015 , with the $ 20 , $ 50 and $ 100 notes set to release in April 2016 .
The old New Zealand banknotes and the new ' Brighter Money ' banknotes can be used interchangeably for the time being .
Since the older banknotes were first issued in 1999 , security features and the technology for designing and printing banknotes have all advanced considerably .
And while counterfeiting rates in New Zealand are low compared to the rest of the world , the New Zealand public and government agree that it is in the best interest to " stay one step ahead of the game " , hence the new notes .
CURRENT CIRCULATING BANKNOTES Section::::Current circulating banknotes .
New Zealand 's five - dollar note was named the banknote of the year for 2015 , a " clear winner " among nearly 40 eligible designs from a record 20 countries .
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand released the new $ 5 and $ 10 notes in October as part of its Brighter Money range .
The $ 5 shows mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary facing the South Island 's Aoraki / Mount Cook , and , on the other side , a rare yellow - eyed penguin and local flora . !

Watermark HISTORY OF NZ$ FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES
Section::::History of NZ$ foreign exchange rates in foreign countries .
With the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in 1971 , both Australia and New Zealand converted the mostly - fixed foreign exchange regimes to a moving peg against the US dollar .
In September 1974 , Australia moved to a peg against a basket of currencies called the trade weighted index ( TWI ) in an effort to reduce fluctuations associated with its peg to the US dollar .
The peg to the TWI was changed to a moving peg in November 1976 , causing the actual value of the peg to be periodically adjusted .
Since the late 1990s , and certainly since the end of the Cold War the US dollar has had less and less overall influence over the value of both the NZ$ and A$ against other currencies .
GLOBAL
FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET Section::::Global foreign exchange market .
The New Zealand dollar contributes greatly to the total global exchange market — far in excess of New Zealand 's relative share of population or global GDP .
According to the Bank for International Settlements , the New Zealand dollar 's share of global foreign exchange market daily turnover in 2016 was 2.1 % ( up from 1.6 % in 2010 ) giving it a rank of 11th .
Trading in the currency has climbed steadily since the same survey in 1998 when the NZD 's ranking was 17th and the share of turnover was just 0.2 % .
