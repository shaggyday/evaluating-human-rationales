POLAR ROUTE
A polar route is an aircraft route across the uninhabited polar ice cap regions .
The term " polar route " was originally applied to great circle routes between Europe and the west coast of North America in the 1950s .
THE ARCTIC HISTORY Section::::The Arctic . Section::::History .
The Soviet pilot Valery Chkalov was the first to fly non - stop from Europe to the American Pacific Coast .
His flight from Moscow , Soviet Union to Vancouver , Washington , United States , via the North Pole on a Tupolev ANT-25 single - engine plane ( June 18–20 , 1937 ) took 63 hours to complete .
The distance covered was .
In September 1945 , a long - distance flight was undertaken for public relations purposes : generals Barney M. Giles , Curtis LeMay and Emmett O'Donnell , Jr. piloted three specially modified B-29s from Chitose Air Base in Hokkaidō to Chicago Municipal Airport , continuing to Washington , D.C. , the farthest nonstop distance to that date flown by U.S. Army Air Forces aircraft and the first - ever nonstop flight from Japan to the U.S ..
The distance covered was approximately 5,839 miles , or 9,397 kilometers .
Two months later , Colonel Clarence S. Irvine commanded another modified B-29 , Pacusan Dreamboat , in a world - record - breaking long - distance flight from Guam to Washington , D.C. , traveling 7,916 miles ( 12,740 km ) in 35 hours , with a gross takeoff weight of 155,000 pounds ( 70,000 kg ) .
Almost a year later , in October 1946 , the same B-29 flew 9,422 miles ( 15,162 km ) nonstop from Oahu , Hawaii , to Cairo , Egypt , in less than 40 hours , further proving the capability of routing airlines over the polar icecap .
Of the commercial airlines , SAS was first : their Douglas DC-6B flights between Los Angeles and Copenhagen , via Sondre Stromfjord and Winnipeg , started on November 15 , 1954 .
Canadian Pacific DC-6Bs started Vancouver – Amsterdam in 1955 , then Pan Am and TWA started West Coast to Paris / London in 1957 .
SAS was first again , flying Europe to Tokyo via Anchorage with Douglas DC-7Cs in February 1957 ; Air France Lockheed L-1649 Starliner ( which was the final version of the Lockheed Constellation ) and KLM DC-7C aircraft followed in 1958 .
During much of the Cold War , the Arctic region was a buffer zone between the Soviet Union and North America ; civilian flights from Europe to the Asian Far East were unable to cross the Soviet Union or China and had to use a Middle East route or connect through Alaska across the Arctic region .
These Cold War tracks extended from the northern Alaskan coast across Greenland to Europe .
Korean Air Lines Flight 902 operated with a Boeing 707 was shot down over the USSR by a Soviet Air Force fighter aircraft in 1978 after the flight crew made gross navigational errors attempting to fly the assigned polar route .
Prior to the advent of today 's modern long range jetliners , Anchorage International Airport ( ANC ) in Alaska was a technical stop for a number of airlines flying the polar route between western Europe and Tokyo .
According to the July 1 , 1983 edition of the Worldwide Official Airline Guide ( OAG ) , Air France , British Airways , Japan Air Lines ( JAL ) , KLM Royal Dutch Airlines , Lufthansa , Sabena and Scandinavian Airlines ( SAS ) were all operating flights between Japan and western Europe which included a stop in Anchorage .
Most of these international airlines were operating earlier model Boeing 747 aircraft on the route at this time , although Sabena and SAS were instead operating McDonnell Douglas DC-10 - 30 aircraft on their respective polar route services via Anchorage .
U.S. based air carrier Western Airlines also flew a polar route during the early 1980s between London Gatwick Airport and Honolulu using DC-10 - 30 aircraft , with these flights also making a stop in Anchorage .
Following the end of the Cold War , the main obstacle to flights across Russia was the inadequate Russian air traffic control system and a lack of English communication .
To solve these issues , RACGAT ( Russian - American Coordinating Group for Air Traffic ) was formed in 1993 .
By summer 1998 , the Russian government gave permission to open four cross - polar routes , named Polar 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 .
Finnair was the first airline to fly non - stop over the polar region between Europe and Japan .
This service began in 1983 and was flown with a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 - 30 wide body jetliner between Tokyo and Helsinki .
Cathay Pacific Flight 889 from New York John F. Kennedy International Airport , piloted by Captain Paul Horsting on 7 July 1998 — the first arrival to the new Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok west of Hong Kong — appears to be the first non - stop flight over the Arctic polar region and over Russian airspace .
It was the world 's first nonstop transpolar flight from New York to Hong Kong , dubbed Polar One .
It took 16 hours to complete , and it was and still is one of the longest flight Cathay Pacific operates .
TODAY Section::::Today .
The American Federal Aviation Administration now defines the North Polar area of operations as the area north of 78 deg north latitude , which is north of Alaska and most of Siberia .
Aircraft like the Boeing 747 - 400 , 747 - 8 , 777 - 200ER , 777 - 200LR , 777 - 300ER and Boeing 787 - 8 and 787 - 9 as well as the Airbus A340 , A350 and A380 , with ranges of around or more , are required in order to travel the long distances nonstop between suitable airports .
Arctic polar routes are now common on airlines connecting Asian cities to North American cities .
Emirates flies nonstop from Dubai to the US West Coast
( San Francisco , Seattle and Los Angeles ) , coming within a few degrees of latitude of the North Pole .
ANTARCTICA
Section::::Antarctica .
Few airlines fly between cities having a great circle route over Antarctica .
Nonstop flights between South Africa and New Zealand , or between Perth , Australia and certain destinations in South America ( including Buenos Aires and São Paulo ) , would overfly Antarctica , but no airline has scheduled such flights .
Flights between Australia and South America and between Australia and South Africa pass near the Antarctic coastline .
Depending on the winds , the Qantas flight QF 63 from Sydney to Johannesburg - O. R. Tambo sometimes flies over the Antarctic Circle to latitude 71 degrees as well and allowing views of the icecap .
Qantas also flies nonstop between Sydney and Santiago de Chile , the most southerly polar route .
Depending on winds , this flight may reach 55 degrees south latitude , but other times 71 degrees , which is enough to cross the polar ice cap .
The polar route across the remote southern Pacific Ocean between South America and Oceania was pioneered by Aerolineas Argentinas , which began service between Buenos Aires via Rio Gallegos to Auckland in the 1980s with a Boeing 747 - 200 aircraft .
Aerolineas Argentinas later operated to Sydney , but ended its flights to New Zealand and Australia in 2014 .
Because of ETOPS limitations on twin - engined aircraft — the maximum distance the aircraft can operate from an airport for emergency landings — only 4-engined aircraft such as the Boeing 747 , Airbus A340 , and Airbus A380 can or could operate routes near Antarctica .
Twin - engined aircraft must fly further north , closer to potential diversion airports ; for example , when Virgin Australia operated a flight from Melbourne to Johannesburg on twin - engined Boeing 777 aircraft with a 180-minute ETOPS rating , the flight was two hours longer than a Qantas flight from Sydney to Johannesburg .
Air New Zealand flies nonstop between Auckland and Buenos Aires - Ezeiza ; in 2015 , government regulators approved its twin - engined Boeing 777 - 200ER aircraft that operate the route for a 330-minute ETOPS rating
( i.e. its 777 aircraft can fly a maximum 330 minutes away from the nearest diversion airport ) , an increase from its previous 240-minute ETOPS rating .
LATAM Airlines began a nonstop flight between Santiago de Chile and Sydney via Auckland in April 2015 with twin - engined Boeing 787 aircraft with a 330-minute ETOPS rating .
LATAM has announced a nonstop flight between Santiago de Chile and Melbourne to begin in October 2017 .
The southernmost flight route with plausible airports would be between Buenos Aires and Perth .
With a 175 ° ( S ) heading , the route 's great circle exceeds 85 ° S and would be within from the South Pole .
Currently , no commercial airliners operates this route .
However , in February , 2018 , it was stated that Norwegian Air Argentina is considering this " less than 15 hours " trans - polar flight between South America and Asia , with a stop - over in Perth enroute Singapore .
They will not fly over the South Pole , but around Antarctica taking advantage of the strong winds which circle that continent in an easterly direction .
Hence , the " westbound " flight from Buenos Aires would actually travel south - east south of Cape Town , over the southern Indian Ocean and on to Perth , while the true " eastbound " flight would also head south - east south of Tasmania and New Zealand , over the South Pacific and on to South America .
If this route becomes operational , a Buenos Aires - Singapore return flight would possibly be the fastest circumnavigation available with commercial airliners , although Perth - Buenos Aires return would be faster but without passing the Equator .
OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS Section::::Operational considerations .
The FAA 's policy letter Guidance for Polar Operations ( March 5 , 2001 ) outlines a number of special requirements for polar flight , which includes two cold - weather suits , special communication capability , designation of Arctic diversion airports and firm recovery plans for stranded passengers , and fuel freeze strategy and monitoring requirements .
Jet fuel freeze temperatures range between .
These temperatures are frequently encountered at cruise altitude throughout the world with no effect since the fuel retains heat from lower elevations , but the intense cold and extended duration of polar flights may cause fuel temperature to approach its freezing point .
Jet A grade with a maximum freeze point of is used in the U.S. , while Jet A1 grade with a maximum freeze point of is used elsewhere .
Modern long - distance airliners are equipped to alert flight crew when fuel temperatures reach above these levels .
The crew must then change altitude , though in some cases due to the low stratosphere over polar regions and its inversion properties the air may actually be somewhat warmer at higher altitudes .
The alerts are typically set at above the specified maximum freeze point .
This provides a safety margin from the solidification temperature .
However , fuels produced at the refineries are often better than the spec values ; for example , it is not uncommon to find Jet A fuels that have measured freeze point better ( colder ) than the specified maximum of .
In that way , the safety margin is even larger than .
On the other hand , the temperature probe that delivers fuel temperature information to the flight deck is not located in the coldest part of the fuel tanks .
The difference between the recorded and the coldest fuel temperature varies depending on a variety of factors , especially the circulation of fuel in the tanks and duration of cold soak .
It is , therefore , prudent to have a safety margin .
For polar flights , FAA allows , under certain conditions , the measured freeze point be used instead of assuming the spec value in ASTM D1655 .
This gives the airlines more flexibility in flight planning .
