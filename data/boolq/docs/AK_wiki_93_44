JUGHEAD JONES Forsythe Pendleton " Jughead " Jones III is one of the fictional characters created by Bob Montana and John L. Goldwater in Archie Comics who first appeared in the first Archie story , from Pep Comics # 22 ( December 1941 ) .
He is the son of John Jones II ; in one of the early Archie newspaper comic strips , he himself is identified as John Jugworth Jones III ( and in one strip , likely due to continuity error , as Forsythe Van Jones ) .
He has a white sheepdog named Hot Dog and a younger sister , Forsythia " Jellybean " Jones .
Jughead ( sometimes shortened to Jug or Juggie ) is the best friend of Archie Andrews .
Jughead is a smart , sharp - tongued , laid - back , easy going and eccentric high school student .
He is obsessed with eating food and in some storylines is asexual .
Most see him as being lazy .
He can be identified by his long nose , half - closed eyes , " S " sweatshirt , and crown - like button beanie hat , called a whoopee cap .
Jughead is portrayed by Cole Sprouse in the live action series Riverdale .
CONCEPT AND CREATION Section::::Concept and creation .
Bob Montana stated that Jughead was a character he imagined , unlike other characters in the series who were based on people he knew .
Montana 's widow , Peg Bertholet , stated that high school friend of Montana 's named Skinny Linehan supposedly had some of Jughead 's peculiar traits .
Bertholet has stated that the " S " insignia refers to a location called Skunk Hill in Haverhill , Massachusetts which Montana turned into Squirrel Hill .
The " S " alludes to a combination of the location and Montana 's elementary school athletic team near Haverhill called the Tigers .
Bertholet has stated that " S " stands for " ' Squirrel Hill Independent Tigers , ' and you could n't abbreviate it any other way . "
HISTORY AND CHARACTER Section::::History and character .
Jughead generally has a characteristic wry and sarcastic sense of humor .
He is considered a bit of an oddity , but prefers his nonconformism as opposed to going along with others ' styles .
His many quirks make him the butt of teasing and abuse from Reggie , Veronica , and even other classmates and teachers .
Many episodes involve Reggie and Jughead trying to outdo one another with pranks and bets , and Jughead almost always comes out the victor .
He is revealed to be extremely clever and creative when necessary and he often takes advantage of Reggie 's and his other tormentors ' weaknesses ( and has fun all the while ) .
In the earlier comics , a running gag involved various characters trying to discover Jughead 's real name , while Jughead thwarted their efforts .
In one story , Archie Andrews and Reggie Mantle go to the school office , where a woman tells them that Jughead 's real first name is Steve .
After Archie and Reggie leave the office , the audience learns that the woman is actually Jughead 's aunt who has just lied as a favor to Jughead to help keep his real first name ( Forsythe ) hidden .
In another story ( issue # 1 of " The Jughead Jones Comics Digest , " June 1977 )
we find out he is named after his ancestor who is an American hero .
For a brief time , Jughead started to use his given name in honor of his ancestor .
After learning that this ancestor was married nine times , Jughead reverted to his nickname .
In the Little Archie series , his real name is revealed by Miss Grundy at the start of class .
He also believes his name attracts girls as in a strip , his name was mentioned and it made the girls crazed for him .
Another mystery that follows Jughead 's character is the meaning of the " S " on his sweatshirt .
This remains a mystery to this day , although many stories have hinted at a meaning .
In Jughead # 30 ( 1992 ) , when his psychiatrist , Sara , asked him " why an ' S ' ?
" he replied " I dunno !
My third cousin was called skinny ...
" The triangular banner on the cover of issue 140 of Archie & Friends shows that the " S " stands for Silby , as in Silby High School , which he attended for a few months as a freshman .
At one time after his sweater was filled with holes due to what he thought was a moth when it was actually a chemical accident caused in lab class , he reveals that he simply likes the letter S and finds it " compatible , " because the letter can stand for " soup , sandwich , steak and all kinds of goodies ! "
after his friends ask him .
Betty rolls her eyes at the explanation and adds , " S stands for " sorry I asked " ! "
Another theory is that he is a non - conformist so when everyone wears " R " which stands for Riverdale he just goes with the next letter " S " .
FOOD OBSESSION Section::::Food obsession .
Jughead is known for his love of food , especially hamburgers , and his ability to consume absurdly large quantities in a single sitting without getting sick or gaining weight , although he often sports a pot - belly immediately after a particularly large meal .
Jughead is a preferred customer of most of Riverdale 's food establishments , especially Pop Tate 's Chock'lit Shoppe , except when he is behind on paying his usually lengthy tab .
In one story , he was given a " Restaurant Club Card " and ate out at high - class restaurants until he found out how much interest the card charged , and Pop Tate loaned him the money on the condition that he eat exclusively at the Chok'lit Shoppe .
His ability to eat so much food without gaining weight is attributed to a very rare and implausibly high metabolism .
He once claimed that he weighed 300 pounds after a meal , although he is usually portrayed as slim and healthy .
Jughead 's special abilities concerning food extend to being able to identify food in a sealed can by smell , and being able to detect the slightest flaws in food preparation by taste .
As such , he is a respected food critic , as well as a gourmet chef himself .
One time , when he sought out Miss Grundy 's help with his creative writing , she suggested that he write about a subject he knew , leading to the " Forsythe P. Jones Cookbook " .
Jughead often participates in eating contests , usually winning outright , or else easily coming from behind after comic distractions , and often with room to spare while the competitor retires unwell .
In a citywide eating contest , he ate a colossal burger made up of sixteen different burgers .
Jughead also set two world records for eating pizza ; one for speed - eating a pizza , and another for eating the most pizzas in one sitting : twelve .
Jughead 's appetite is so large that even if he eats shortly before such contests , it does not affect his performance .
For example , a rival high school once sent a girl , Jane Dough , to take Jughead to various restaurants and feed him as much as possible .
Amazingly , Jughead still managed to win the contest .
He explained to Jane that top athletes need to train constantly in order to stay in shape , and she actually helped him " train " for the contest .
One running gag depicts Jughead visiting restaurants that promise " all you can eat " special deals , with the devastated restaurateur closing down as Jughead leaves .
Despite his appetite , Jughead is not known to be stingy with food , or to let others go hungry .
When a store selling penny candy opened in Riverdale , he spent his whole allowance on a huge bag of candy , only to meet a penniless young boy outside the shop .
Jughead wrestled with his desire , but he chose to give the candy to the boy .
In a similar story , Jughead met a homeless person who liked the same kind of pizza as he did , and decided to give him the pizza he had just purchased .
In another story , after winning three pizzas a week for six months for being a pizzeria 's one - millionth customer , he donated them all to a soup kitchen where he volunteered .
Because of his well - known food obsession , Jughead was shown eating a hamburger on the facades of the short - lived Archie 's Family Restaurants .
JUGHEAD 'S
HAT
Section::::Jughead 's hat .
Jughead is almost always seen wearing his trademark beanie with both a round and square pin .
This type of crown - shaped cap , called a whoopee cap , sometimes a " jughead cap " or " crown " , was popular among boys in the 1930s and 1940s .
It was made from a man 's felt fedora hat with the brim trimmed in a zig - zag and turned up .
Bottle caps could be " pinned " in place using the cap 's removable cork lining .
In the 1920s and 1930s , college freshmen were sometimes required to wear them for initiation purposes , and such caps were often worn by mechanics .
Similar caps have appeared on other comic book / strip , cartoon , and children 's book characters such as Eddie Stimson in Little Lulu , Melvin Wisenheimer in Little Audrey , Skuzz in The Berenstain Bears , and Bugs Meany in Encyclopedia Brown as well as on Goober Pyle on The Andy Griffith Show and Jeff Goldblum 's character "
Freak # 1 " in Death Wish .
Jughead 's hat was recolored in black in the Filmation cartoons and pink in The New Archies .
Over the course of the character 's publication , Jughead 's hat has evolved from a modified fedora to its more recognisable " crown " appearance .
Though some view the hat as strange and immature , Jughead considers it a good luck charm and when it is taken from him , misfortune comes his way .
While on the school baseball team , Jughead was pulled aside and reprimanded by school principal Mr. Weatherbee for wearing the hat instead of a proper baseball uniform cap .
Jughead complied , but then started performing so badly that Weatherbee was forced to relent .
In the " Time Police " comic , there is a double of his beanie given to him by an unknown benefactor ( later revealed to be himself ) that allows him to travel in time .
Some stories showed him wear a unique pin on his hat which attracts many girls to him , so he hid it to avoid the crowd of girls rushing him .
The hat also seems to define part of Jughead 's personality .
One story has the gang try to convince him to try a different hat , but it 's revealed that whatever hat he tried on changed his personality to suit the hat .
When they had him try on a detective hat , he zeroed in on clues that would have gotten Archie in trouble with Betty and Veronica , and took a hair from Reggie 's sweater that implied that he sneaked a date with Midge behind Moose 's back ( the look on both of their faces imply he was on to something ) .
Jughead also stated that he felt naked without a hat .
Finally , Veronica gave him a special hat to try on .
When he did , everyone said it suited him
( it was an ugly thing but looked comical .
She said she was saving it for a Mad Hatter party ) .
Jughead tried wearing it for a day at school , but scared several students , teachers , and even Miss Beazly the cafeteria lady )
they begged him to go back to his trademark hat .
When he asked what they 'd do if he did , they offered him a platter of hamburgers and he happily agreed .
In Jughead and Friends Digest # 25 story " The Secret of Jughead 's Hat "
his cap is destroyed in a laundry accident .
Wendy Weatherbee ( Principal Weatherbee 's niece ) replaces the lost hat by doing exactly as explained above when she takes an old Fedora and cuts it and shapes it to remake the whoopee cap or crown .
FAMILY AND FRIENDS Section::::Family and friends .
Jughead 's best friend is Archie Andrews , despite their personality difference .
Archie was the first person that Jughead met upon moving to Riverdale , and he is often dragged into Archie 's schemes and antics .
Jughead is usually the first one to bail Archie out of trouble ( though some times he only makes things worse ) .
Jughead , extremely loyal , is willing to do almost anything to help his friend , something that Archie occasionally takes for granted .
Reggie Mantel is another one of Jughead 's close friends , though his and Jughead 's relationship is defined by their constant competition .
Reggie never loses an opportunity to insult Jughead ( " needle - nose " being his favorite nickname ) and Jughead often responds with tricks to aggravate Reggie .
Though it often appears they hate each other , and neither will admit otherwise , they really do care for one another .
Jughead will even help Reggie escape being injured when Moose Mason is angry with him .
Alongside Archie , Betty Cooper slips into the best friend role for Jughead in the comics .
Their mutual love and appreciation for food ( she cooks , he eats ) , and continuously going to bat for each other have made their friendship a stronghold in the comics .
While generally disinterested in matters of the heart , Jughead frequently stands up for Betty when Archie breaks her heart .
In the show Riverdale , Betty and Jughead are dating .
Writers and fans of Archie Comics sometimes comment that if they were to pair Jughead up with one of the girls , it would be Betty .
In one comic , Jughead tells Betty that if he were to ever kiss a girl willingly , it would be her . "
Cyrano Jones " is one of the more modern arcs in Archie Comics that alludes to some hidden feelings Jughead harbors for Betty .
Jughead and Veronica Lodge are constantly arguing .
Veronica can not stand his laid - back attitude witticisms , and Jughead enjoys teasing her and making her lose her temper with clever insults .
Their relationship would be considered that of " frenemies " .
Although at times , he relishes causing her to get angry because sometimes he sees her as an uncaring selfish snob .
He once told Veronica he was " mad with passion " for her , and began popping up wherever she went , to get her off his back after she criticized him publicly .
They were once cast together in a school play , which required them to kiss .
Due to the way Jughead kissed her , she was caught up in the moment and fell in love with him for a while .
However , Jughead managed to get her over her crush , with the help of a garlic and onion sandwich .
Jughead 's other friends include Dilton Doiley and Moose Mason .
Other than Dilton , Jughead probably gets along with Moose better than the other boys because of his non - confrontational attitude ( and his lack of interest in Moose 's girlfriend Midge ) .
Jughead 's nerdy ways and lack of interest in sports and girls probably account for how well he gets along with Dilton .
Jughead 's family includes his father , also named Forsythe , his mother Gladys , and in later comics , his younger sister Jellybean .
He also has many eccentric relatives including slightly - addled Uncle Herman , or " Doc Jones " , a daffy and slightly pompous inventor whose creations usually wreak havoc on Jughead and/or his friends and his lookalike younger cousin , Souphead .
Other one - time relatives appear frequently .
Jughead also tells many stories of his ancestors , who prove to be quite as interesting as himself .
A 1970s " Archie " cartoon episode featured Jughead 's paternal grandparents — both of whom resemble Jughead .
Another acquaintance of Jughead 's is Trula Twyst , Riverdale High 's budding pop psychologist , who is constantly trying to analyze Jughead to determine what makes him so odd .
The two share a strange love / hate relationship that would have gone much smoother had they not met the way they did-
Trula tricked Jughead into dating her in order to become more popular .
In one story , Jughead claimed his great - grandmother was a Native American " from the Pawtuxet tribe , " despite the fact that the Patuxet were killed off by 1622 .
In another story from the same era , he claimed his great - great - grandfather was " an eskimo , " who was " the only cop north of Nome ...
'Ol ' Bluenose Jones '
they called him !
"
It is likely that neither of these claims are meant to be taken seriously .
In both stories he also used his claims to make fun of Veronica , which suggests more that his comments were meant as jokes , since Jughead has a history of making up fibs to tease Veronica and other opponents .
In the " Mad Magazine " universe , Jughead 's doppelgänger is nicknamed Bottleneck .
Bottleneck wears a beanie that resembles a broken bottleneck .
His best friend ( and fellow juvenile delinquent ) is Starchie .
MINISERIES Section::::Miniseries .
Jughead 's Time Police was a series that began in 1990 featuring Jughead as a hero of the 29th century and a member of the Time Police , an organization that ensures history to remain the same for the future 's sake .
In this series , the beanie gives Jughead the ability to time travel by thinking .
With his supervisor , Marshal January McAndrews , Jughead repairs disturbances in the past .
Other spin - offs include Jughead 's Diner in 1990 , where he ran a diner with an eclectic cast of patrons ; and Jughead 's Fantasy , resulting from Jughead 's Folly , lasted for three issues and featured Jughead 's dreams of various alter - egos , including " Sir Jugalot " , " Peter Goon -- Private Eye " , and " Son of Hercules " .
Jughead also featured in Explorers of the Unknown , playing Squint , a daredevil escape artist .
SEXUALITY Section::::Sexuality .
Jughead is known for his uninterest in romantic relationships with girls , setting him apart from Archie and Reggie .
Jughead 's philosophy on romantic relationships , gained from observing Archie 's romantic entanglements , is that dating complicates a guy 's life and deprives him of cash that could be used to buy burgers .
This often attracts girls rather than repels them .
His most ardent admirer is Ethel Muggs , an awkward but very friendly girl who chases after Jughead at every opportunity , despite Jughead 's constant and blunt refusals .
Recent story - lines have shown a decrease in her obsession with him , and even show her dating other guys , surprisingly making Jughead jealous .
Jughead secretly enjoys the attention , although he claims he puts up with Ethel 's company only if she cooks for him .
He has shown romantic interest in her on rare occasions , and eventually fell in love with her in the Life With Archie :
The Married Life series where the " Archie Marries Veronica " stories ended with Jughead and Ethel 's wedding .
In 2016 , Jughead 's orientation was confirmed to be asexual in the stories of Chip Zdarsky ( and later Ryan North and Mark Waid ) for the Jughead comics as part of the New Riverdale line .
Zdarsky said of his run on the book that " the next writer could make him discover girls or boys or both
and that 's totally fine .
There have been iterations of Jughead over the decades where he HAS been interested in girls , so there 's room to play around if someone was inclined .
For me though , I like an asexual Jughead . "
He later tweeted that he viewed Jughead as " ace and probably demi - romantic , but for the purposes of his teen years , aro . "
Both Riverdale fans in the asexual community and Cole Sprouse , who portrays Jughead in The CW 's Riverdale , have complained of asexual erasure in mainstream television and expressed desire to see the character 's asexuality explored .
However , Sprouse later noted that the Jughead Zdarsky created is the only asexual version so far .
At the same time , he said that Jughead is aromantic in the classic Archie stories , " a different thing [ from asexuality ] but deserves attention as well . "
A group of girls formed the UGAJ ( United Girls Against Jughead ) in an effort to get him interested in romance , using methods such as computers or food , though ultimately failing .
For his first forty years or so , Jughead often claimed girls were despicable , and even as late as the 1990s .
A shift in societal attitudes has caused later writers and fans to try different ways of explaining this , such as past heartbreak from childhood romance , bad impressions from Veronica and Ethel , and most recently in the 2015 reboot , asexuality .
There has never been one consistent canon explanation for Jughead 's avoidance of girls and dating .
In one story , Jughead declares , " I do n't hate girls — I just love food more ! "
In the story " Phood Phobia " , Archie and Dilton Doiley discover a hidden layer to this : it turns out that Jughead is actually nervous around girls , and he turns to food for comfort .
When confronted with this , Jughead is stunned ; finding out that girls are the reason he enjoys food so much makes him lose his appetite .
In another story , when Jughead saw that Miss Grundy was upset on her birthday , he rallied the other students to cheer her up .
In " A Lass From The Past " , written by Nate Butler and first appearing in Jughead # 5 ( April 1988 ) , Jughead explains the reason he does not chase after girls is because of a childhood heartbreak , sustained before he moved to Riverdale .
Little Jughead befriended Joani and they had a puppy love relationship .
Jughead 's family moved to Riverdale and he had to leave Joani behind .
Determined to not endure heartbreak again , he swore off girls , keeping little Joani 's picture in his wallet as a reminder .
That changed when Debbie moved to town ( in " Jughead 's Journal , " written by Rod Ollerenshaw and also first appearing in Jughead # 5 ) , and Jughead began to overcome his old heartbreak as they started dating .
However , Joani suddenly visits town .
Now a young woman , she tells Jughead that she never forgot him and still has a crush on him , and they share their first kiss .
Before Jughead decides whether he wants to pursue a relationship with Joani , she leaves him , but with a promise that they will be together again .
The comic even had Jughead say , " Sometimes , life is just more interesting than burgers and shakes .
" For a while , Debbie and Joani formed Jughead 's own love triangle , but fans did not like it , so both girls disappeared and Jughead reverted to his classic independent lifestyle .
A few years later , a girl named Trula Twyst appeared .
She tends to drive Jughead crazy with her ability to predict his next moves , and they developed a love - hate relationship .
Another thread that has run through stories in recent years involves a psychic experience he is supposed to have had , caused by an odd pin he wears on his hat .
In the early 1990s , Jughead had three girlfriends : Debbie , Joani , and January McAndrews .
The latter is Archie 's descendant in the future , who starred with Jughead in Jughead 's Time Police , a short - lived spinoff comic about their adventures traveling through time .
Archie Comics trademarked the term " Bughead " , the name created by fans of the relationship between Betty and Jughead in both comics and the CW Riverdale .
Betty and Jughead are canon , romantically , so far only in the Riverdale universe , though Archie Comics has introduced their sleuthing relationship and subsequent ship name ( # bughead ) into their run of Riverdale tie - in comics .
MUSICAL INTERESTS
Section::::Musical interests .
Jughead was the drummer for The Archies .
In one four - part story , which included many flashbacks of Jughead 's life , Archie had commented that the reason he 'd chosen the position of drummer was that he was too introverted to play at the front of the stage .
Another reason was that he could put food in his drums to eat while he played .
He has also professed a love for jazz music , once detailed in an issue of Jughead Magazine where he develops an obsession with an obscure jazz drummer named " Crazy " Willie Jim .
After collecting his records , Jughead finally met Jim , who was now very old , ailing and reclusive , playing on a street corner .
Jughead convinced Jim that he was trustworthy and they became fast friends .
Jim even played with The Archies at one of their gigs .
Jim died very soon after , so Jughead sat in with Jim 's friends on the corner to play one last , mournful version of " St. James Infirmary Blues " .
SPECIAL ABILITIES
Section::::Special abilities .
In spite of his reputation as slow and lazy , Jughead is frequently shown to be extremely intelligent , and often surprises his skeptical friends ( notably Reggie Mantle and Veronica Lodge ) with his vast knowledge on a wide variety of subjects , including history , Shakespeare , sports , and science .
In several issues , Jughead has demonstrated that his IQ is well above average .
He is an extremely good student , which exasperates his teachers when he sometimes pays them no attention .
His intelligence varies from story to story .
In many cases , he has trouble keeping decent grades , but was once given an award for being the best student in the school .
Once , in Little Archie , it was revealed that as a student , Jughead was second only to Dilton Doiley .
His intelligence is displayed by his sharp wit , the occasional deep insight , and the odd chance he gets to upstage or outsmart Reggie Mantle .
In one issue , Mr. Weatherbee tries to cut down on Jughead 's food consumption , only to realize that Jughead 's brain stops functioning without massive amounts of food .
Professor Flutesnoot implies that Jughead 's brain burns all the calories , which keeps him thin .
Jughead is also a talented artist , and refers to his works as his " Dipsy Doodles " , which feature in one - page comic strips .
Often , what he paints comes to life or becomes a real , three - dimensional object .
Another recurring gag , featured in the 1960s , was " Professor Jughead " , where he would wear a gown and mortarboard and lecture to his fellow teenagers about subjects he considered relevant .
However , the content of the lesson was often nonsensical and useless in real life .
Professor Jughead 's Loony Laws was a strip in which he presented various dumb laws .
One strip explores the fact that Jughead is seldom drawn with his eyes open by noting that Jughead has the unusual ability to " see " with his eyes completely shut , and not see with them open .
In his spare time , he enjoys playing video games , reading comic books , and skateboarding .
It was also noted in one issue that he has an interest in Japanese anime and manga as well , with titles such as Sailor Lunar ,
Dragon Tall 33 , Tech Robo , and Tragic Knight Sayearth .
In the late 1980s , Jughead became obsessed with the skateboarding subculture , and his interests and taste in fashion were revamped to fit this .
A number of short - lived characters were added to the Jughead comics , including his paraplegic African - American crush Anita ; blind rival for Ethel 's affections Jeff and his guide dog Spike ; and heavy metal band
The Potholes .
However , this makeover only lasted for a few years .
Jughead rarely takes an interest in sports , but has a few unexpected athletic talents .
These are often side effects of his other activities .
For example , he is a very fast runner due to his constant evasion of Ethel and his determination to be at the front of the lunchline every day .
Coach Kleats often tries to recruit him for various school teams , usually without longterm success .
Over the years , he has been seen as a basketball player , baseball pitcher , martial artist , swimmer , dancer and gymnast .
Many stories revolve around other characters making comments about Jughead 's appetite .
One story has Dilton Doiley making calculations to scientifically prove that it 's impossible for Jughead to eat the way that he does , and even convinces Pop Tate to cook everything Jughead ate earlier to prove it .
When the entire gang is n't paying attention , Jughead ate all the food and ended the story by saying that if they did n't believe it they could make the food and he 'd eat it again .
Another story has Jughead going against a guy from another group in an eating contest .
The rival gang sends a girl to feed Jughead to fill him up the night before in an effort to cheat but he manages to win anyway .
In still another , Archie expresses concern over Jughead 's eating and lack of exercise , which prompts Reggie to show off lifting a single crate of Pop 's bottles over his head .
Jughead helps Pop by effortlessly lifting three crates at once and carrying them to the back room , stunning Archie and Reggie .
Unnerving them even more , he rips out a stool that Pop said he could take for a souvenir ( he was replacing his counter stools later that day ) with one hand again with no effort .
In that story , he says he eats to get strong , cracking up Archie and Reggie , but they change their mind when they see he 's very strong , and even take up eating in an effort to get strong , with no success .
Often , when Jughead attempts to join a team , he ends up with an undesirable menial task , such as water - boy or equipment manager .
However , he often takes part in less strenuous school activities , such as the school newspaper , the Blue and Gold .
His reputation as a food critic and his unbiased views of the school teams make him a valuable member of the staff .
In some stories , Jughead has been shown to have supernatural abilities that are never seen again .
These include controlling weather , giving the evil - eye , learning the skills presented in any book he reads , and predicting the future .
In the " Super Teens " stories ( where several of the main Archie characters are secretly superheroes ) , Jughead could become Captain Hero , gaining a caped costume and more muscular physique ( varying from story to story ) , but retaining his crown - shaped cap .
Captain Hero appeared when Jughead recites the magic incantation ( similar to Green Lantern 's oath ) : Teeny weeny magic beanie pointing towards the sky ; give me muscle , power , vigor - form a super guy !
Captain Hero often seemed to possess just the right powers for the problem at hand .
These were never completely defined , but he maintained certain " stock " superhuman powers , such as flight , enhanced strength and resistance to injury .
Early on , Captain Hero was often the most serious and competent of the Super Teens , and the others would defer to his leadership , in contrast to Jughead 's perceived status as Archie 's sidekick and a generally lazy individual .
HOT DOG Section::::Hot Dog .
Hot Dog is a long - haired mutt who resembles a white Old English Sheepdog .
He belongs to Jughead , although when he first appeared in Pep Comics # 224 ( December 1968 ) , he belonged to Archie .
Hot Dog switched owners frequently in his early appearances , but was eventually given a permanent home with Jughead .
Hot Dog usually thinks like a human , in that his thoughts are presented in thought bubbles .
He is lazy , constantly hungry , and , much like Jughead , has a dislike for Reggie Mantle .
Hot Dog is usually considered a member of Archie 's Gang .
He tends to be attracted to Veronica Lodge 's pedigreed dogs , and even had a litter of puppies with one of them , a poodle named Lucretia .
In the 1970s series Sabrina the Teenage Witch , Hot Dog has a sidekick , Chili Dog , who is smaller and red - haired .
A running gag is the two dogs ' " battles " with Sabrina 's cat Salem Saberhagen .
In the alternate universe limited series Jughead 's Pal , Hot Dog , when Jughead 's family objects to Hot Dog living indoors because he is covered in dirt , Dilton Doiley builds Hot Dog a doghouse full of whimsical inventions .
Hot Dog 's sidekick in that short - lived series is a chihuahua named Pablito .
IN OTHER MEDIA Section::::In other media .

In the show , Jughead wears an ordinary dark gray knitted hat with points and pins , but appears in a dream sequence wearing his distinctive crown cap and " S " sweatshirt .
His mother and sister are mentioned but absent , having left due to his father 's drinking .
His father , F.P. , is leader of the Southside Serpents , and Jughead , choosing not to live with him , is homeless .
In the first season finale , the Serpents offer Jughead one of their jackets , essentially making him an honorary member .
In the second season , he undergoes an initiation that includes a brutal beating to become a full - fledged member .
Over time , he becomes a de facto leader of the teenagers in the gang , and in the second season finale , after he attempts to save the Serpents from a fight with a rival gang that badly outnumbers them by trading himself , F.P. retires and names him as his successor .
Jughead 's first act as Serpent King is to induct Cheryl Blossom into the Serpents .
