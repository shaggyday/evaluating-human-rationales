UTERUS TRANSPLANTATION
The uterine transplant is the surgical procedure whereby a healthy uterus is transplanted into an organism of which the uterus is absent or diseased .
As part of normal mammalian sexual reproduction , a diseased or absent uterus does not allow normal embryonic implantation , effectively rendering the female infertile .
This phenomenon is known as absolute uterine factor infertility ( AUFI ) .
Uterine transplant is a potential treatment for this form of infertility .
HISTORY STUDIES Section::::History .
Section::::Studies .
In 1896 , Emil Knauer , a 29-year - old Austrian working in one of Vienna 's gynecological clinics , published the first study of ovarian autotransplantation documenting normal function in a rabbit .
This led to the investigation of uterine transplantation in 1918 .
In 1964 and 1966 , Eraslan , Hamernik and Hardy , at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson , Mississippi , were the first to perform an animal ( dog ) autotransplantation of the uterus and subsequently deliver a pregnancy from that uterus .
In 2010 Diaz - Garcia and co - workers , at Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology , University of Gothenburg in Sweden , demonstrated the world 's first successful allogenic uterus transplantation , in a rat , with healthy offspring .
CASES TRANSPLANTS Section::::Cases .
Section::::Transplants .
In 1931 , in Germany , Lili Elbe , a Danish transgender woman , died from organ rejection three months after receiving one of the world 's earliest uterine transplants .
With the availability of in vitro fertilization in 1978 , uterine transplantation research was deferred .
In Saudi Arabia in 2000 , a uterine transplant was performed by Dr. Wafa Fagee , from a 46-year - old hysterectomy patient into a 26-year - old recipient whose own uterus had hemorrhaged after childbirth .
The transplanted uterus functioned for 99 days , but ultimately needed to be removed after failure due to blood clotting .
Within the medical community there was some debate as to whether or not the transplant could truly be considered to have been successful .
Post - operatively , the patient had two spontaneous menstrual cycles , followed by amenorrhoea ; exploratory laparotomy confirmed uterine necrosis .
The procedure has raised some moral and ethical concerns , which have been addressed in the literature .
In Turkey , on 9 August 2011 , the world 's first uterus transplant from a deceased donor was conducted by a team of doctors at Akdeniz University Hospital in Antalya .
The 21-year - old Turkish woman , Derya Sert , who had been born without a uterus , was the first woman in history to receive a womb from a deceased donor .
The operation , performed by Dr. Ömer Özkan , Dr. Munire Erman Akar and their team , was the world 's first uterus transplant surgery gaining long - term function , as evident by the fact that Ms. Sert has had six menstrual periods post - surgery and is said to have a fully functioning uterus .
The Turkish medical team who performed the delicate surgery , however , is still cautious about declaring the operation a complete success .
" The surgery was a success .
But we will be successful when she has her baby " , Ozkan said .
" For now , we are happy that the tissue is living " .
On 12 April 2013 , Akdeniz University announced that Derya Sert was pregnant .
The statement made by the university hospital also added that Ms Sert would give birth by C - section to prevent any complications .
On 14 May 2013 , it was announced that Ms Sert had terminated her pregnancy in its 8th week following a routine examination where doctors failed to detect a fetal heartbeat .
In Sweden in 2012 , the first mother - to - daughter womb transplant was done by Swedish doctors at Sahlgrenska University Hospital at Gothenburg University led by Mats Brännström .
The first uterine transplant performed in the United States took place on 24 February 2016 at the Cleveland Clinic .
The transplant failed due to a complication on 8 March and the uterus was removed .
In April it was disclosed that a yeast infection by Candida albicans had caused damage to the local artery compromising the blood support of the uterus and necessitating its removal .
The first uterine transplant performed in India took place on 18 May 2017 at the Galaxy Care Hospital in Pune , Maharashtra .
The 26-year - old patient had been born without a uterus , and received her mother 's womb in the transplant .
FIRST SUCCESSFUL PREGNANCY Section::::First successful pregnancy .
In October 2014 , it was announced that , for the first time , a healthy baby had been born to a uterine transplant recipient , at an undisclosed location in Sweden .
The British medical journal
The Lancet reported that the baby boy had been born in September , weighing 1.8 kg ( 3.9 lb ) and that the father had said his son was " amazing " .
The baby had been delivered prematurely at about 32 weeks , by cesarean section , after the mother had developed pre - eclampsia .
The Swedish woman , aged 36 , had received a uterus in 2013 , from a live 61-year - old donor , in an operation led by Dr. Brännström , Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Gothenburg .
The woman had healthy ovaries but was born without a uterus , a condition that affects about one in 4,500 women .
The procedure used an embryo from a laboratory , created using the woman 's ovum and her husband 's sperm , which was then implanted into the transplanted uterus .
The uterus may have been damaged in the course of the caesarian delivery and it may or may not be suitable for future pregnancies .
A regimen of triple immuno - suppression was used with tacrolimus , azathioprine , and corticosteroids .
Three mild rejection episodes occurred , one during the pregnancy , but were all successfully suppressed with medication .
Some other women were also reported to be pregnant at that time using transplanted uteri .
The unnamed mother , who received a donated womb from a friend , said that she hoped the treatment would be refined to help others in the future .
The transplant is intended to be temporary – the recipient will undergo a hysterectomy after one or two successful pregnancies .
This is to avoid the need for her to take immunosuppressive drugs for life with a consequent increased risk of infection .
The procedure remains the last resort – it is expensive and not likely to be covered by insurance and , unlike other methods of fertility assistance and treatment , is a relatively new and somewhat experimental procedure , performed only by certain specialist surgeons in select centres , in which the attendant risks of a relatively invasive organ transplant operation , including infection and organ rejection .
Some ethics specialists regard the risks to a live donor , as opposed to a post - mortem donor , as being too great , and some find the entire procedure ethically questionable , especially since the transplant is not a life - saving procedure .
THE SECOND CENTER TO SUCCEED Section::::The second center to succeed .
In November 2017 , the first baby was born after a uterus transplantation in the US .
The birth occurred at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas , TX , after a uterus donation from a non - directed living donor .
INDIA Section::::India .
India 's first uterine transplant baby , weighing 1.45 kg , was delivered through a Caesarean section at Galaxy Care Hospital in pune on Thursday .
The surgery was performed by a team of doctors at Pune 's Galaxy Care Hospital and led by the hospital 's medical director , Dr. Shailesh Puntambekar .
DESCRIPTION PROCEDURES Section::::Description .
Section::::Procedures .
Uterine transplantation starts with the uterus retrieval surgery on the donor .
Working techniques for this exist for animals , including primates and more recently humans .
The recovered uterus may need to be stored , for example for transportation to the location of the recipient .
Studies on cold - ischemia / eperfusion indicate an ischemic tolerance of more than 24 hours .
The recipient has to look at potentially three major surgeries .
First of all , there is the transplantation surgery .
If a pregnancy is established and carried to viability a cesarean section is performed .
As the recipient is treated with immuno - suppressive therapy , eventually , after completion of childbearing , a hysterectomy needs to be done so that the immuno - suppressive therapy can be terminated .
ETHICS MONTREAL CRITERIA Section::::Ethics .
Section::::Montreal criteria .
Aside from considerations of costs uterine transplantation involves complex ethical issues .
The principle of autonomy supports the procedure , while the principle of non - maleficence argues against it .
In regard to the principles of beneficence and justice the procedure appears equivocal .
To address this dilemma the " Montreal Criteria for the Ethical Feasibility of Uterine Transplantation " were developed at McGill University and published in Transplant International in 2012 .
The Montreal Criteria are a set of criteria deemed to be required for the ethical execution of the uterine transplant in humans .
These findings were presented at the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics ' 20th World Congress in Rome in October 2012 .
In 2013 an update to " The Montreal Criteria for the Ethical Feasibility of Uterine Transplantation " was published in Fertility and Sterility and has been proposed as the international standard for the ethical execution of the procedure .
The criteria set conditions for the recipient , the donor , and the health care team , specifically :
* The recipient is a cisgender female with no medical contraindications to transplantation , has uterine disease that has failed other therapy , has " a personal or legal contraindication " to other options ( surrogacy , adoption ) .
It is asked that she wants a child , is suitable for motherhood , psychologically fit , likely to be compliant with treatment , and understand the risks of the procedure .
*
* The donor is a female of reproductive age with no contraindication to the procedure who has concluded her childbearing or consented donating her uterus after her death .
It is asked that there is no coercion and the donor is responsible and sound to make informed decisions .
*
* The health care team belongs to an institution that meets Moore 's third criterion regarding institutional stability and has provided informed consent to both parties .
It is asked that there is no conflict of interests , and anonymity can be protected unless recipient or donor waive
this right .
*
It has been noted that the decision to exclude transgender women from the criteria may lack justification .
