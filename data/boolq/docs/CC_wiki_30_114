COMPANY TROUBLES Section::::Company troubles .
At the time , Rite Aid had just acquired Thrifty PayLess and was integrating the stores into the company .
As a result , Leonard Green , who ran the investment firm that had sold those stores to Rite Aid , took control of the company and installed Mary Sammons from Fred Meyer as CEO .
In July 2001 , Rite Aid agreed to improve their pharmacy complaint process by implementing a new program to respond to consumer complaints .
On July 25 , 2004 , Rite Aid agreed to pay $ 7 million to settle allegations that the company had submitted false prescription claims to United States government health insurance programs .
In August 2007 , Rite Aid acquired approximately 1,850 Brooks and Eckerd Stores throughout the United States in hopes of improving their accessibility to a wider range of consumers .
On December 21 , 2007 , The New York Times reported that Rite Aid had record - breaking losses that year , despite the acquisition of the Brooks and Eckerd chains .
The following fiscal quarter saw an increase in revenue but a sharp fall in net income as Rite Aid began the integration process .
Rite Aid shares fell over 75 % between September 2007 and September 2008 , closing at a low of $ 0.98 on September 11 , 2008 .
Rite Aid shares subsequently dropped to $ 0.20 on March 6 , 2009 , the all - time low .
Scott Cole & Associates , APC filed a class action lawsuit against Rite Aid Corporation on behalf of its salaried California Store Managers .
It was alleged that Rite Aid failed to pay overtime to these workers and denied them their meal and rest periods .
In 2009 , the action settled for $ 6.9 million .
Rite Aid had a major accounting scandal that led to the departure ( and subsequent jail time ) of several top ranking executives , including CEO Martin Grass .

Founder Alex Grass died of cancer on August 27 , 2009 .

CUSTOMER LOYALTY AND REWARDS
PROGRAMS Section::::Customer loyalty and rewards programs .
The wellness+ card is Rite Aid 's free shopping rewards card that started nationwide on April 18 , 2010 .
It became a part of the newly launched American Express - backed Plenti rewards program in May 2015 .
Rite Aid introduced wellness+ BonusCash on January 1 , 2018 .
Customers can no longer earn Plenti points ; instead , they earn BonusCash that can only be redeemed at Rite Aid .
However , Rite Aid would remain a part of the Plenti rewards program , which would end on July 10 , 2018 .
MERGER WITH ECKERD AND BROOKS Section::::Merger with Eckerd and Brooks .
On August 23 , 2006 the Wall Street Journal announced that Rite Aid would be buying the Eckerd Pharmacy and Brooks Pharmacy chains ( Brooks Eckerd Pharmacy ) from the Quebec - based Jean Coutu Group for US$ 3.4 billion , and merging the two chains into one dominant pharmacy system .
The company 's shareholders overwhelmingly approved the merger on January 18 , 2007 .
After some store closures and the conversion of the two chains was completed , Rite Aid became the dominant drug store retailer in the Eastern U.S. , and the third largest drug retailer nationwide ( behind the faster - growing Walgreens and CVS chains ) .
Similar to what CVS experienced in the Chicago metropolitan area after its purchase of Albertsons drug store chains , the deal gave Rite Aid stores that were too close to each other .
( Only 23 stores nationally were sold to Walgreens , The Medicine Shoppe , or independent owners to meet federal regulations . )
In many situations , especially in Pennsylvania , where both chains were dominant and had roots in the Commonwealth ( Rite Aid originated in Scranton ; Eckerd began in Erie , while Thrift Drug was popular in the Pittsburgh area ) , there were , in some cases , neighboring Rite Aid stores .
However , in March 2008 some of these overlapping stores were closed .
Most of these stores that closed were pre - existing Rite Aids from before the Eckerd deal , since Eckerd had built newer , more modern stores with drive - through pharmacies and larger space under ownership of both JCPenney and Jean Coutu Group ; and the " moved to " sites were converted Eckerds .
Employees at the closed stores were transferred to nearby ones , so no layoffs were necessary .
Rite Aid had sold some stores to JCPenney 's Thrift Drug chain in the mid-1990s shortly before JCPenney 's acquisition of Eckerd and had also sold all of their Massachusetts stores to Brooks in 1995 , bringing some existing Eckerd and Brooks stores that were once Rite Aids full circle .
Because Eckerd was previously owned by JCPenney , Eckerd stores accepted JCPenney charge cards .
Since the merger , all Rite Aids take JCPenney charge cards , a policy also followed by competitor CVS / pharmacy , which had earlier acquired most of the Eckerd chain in the southeastern United States .
As of 2017 , New York with 600 stores is home to the largest number of Rite Aids , followed by California and Pennsylvania with 583 and 540 respectively .
With the acquisition of Brooks Eckerd , at its peak in 2008 , Rite Aid had a total of 5,059 stores and employed 112,800 people .
MARKET EXITS
Section::::Market exits .
On January 4 , 2008 , Rite Aid Corporation announced that it would terminate operation of its 28 Rite Aid stores in the Las Vegas , Nevada , area and had signed an agreement to sell patient prescription files from that metro market to Walgreens .
The company said Las Vegas was a non - core market that had not been contributing to overall results , and it had not opened a new store there since 1999 .
One Nevada store would remain open in Gardnerville , near the California border , where Rite Aid at the time had more than 600 stores .
On February 5 , 2009 , Rite Aid announced that it would terminate operations of seven Rite Aid stores in San Francisco , along with five stores in eastern Idaho through a sale to Walgreens .
SALE OF STORES
TO WALGREENS Section::::Sale of stores to Walgreens .
On October 27 , 2015 , Walgreens announced that it would acquire Rite Aid in a deal valued at $ 9.4 billion ( $ 9 per share ) , pending regulatory and shareholder approval .
The deal would have resulted in a merger of two of the United States ' three largest pharmacy chains .
Walgreens planned to keep the Rite Aid name on existing stores when the deal went through , though the long term plans for the Rite Aid name were unknown .
On December 21 , 2016 , it was announced that Fred 's would acquire 865 Rite Aid stores as a result of the merger for $ 950 million , for antitrust reasons .
In January 2017 , Rite Aid and Walgreens cut the price of the merger to approximately $ 6.8 billion and delayed the merger by six months .
On January 31 , 2017 , it was reported that the workers ' union 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East , representing 6,000 Rite Aid Corp workers , was opposed to the sale of the Rite Aid stores to Fred 's Inc.
On June 29 , 2017 , Walgreens ( WBA ) announced the merger was cancelled , adding that it would be purchasing 2,186 stores from Rite Aid for $ 5.2 billion plus a $ 325 million penalty for cancelling .
Most experts had thought that the merger would be completed within a few weeks .
The merger would have had about 46 % of the market share .
The revised deal — now not including Fred 's at all — effectively would have seen Rite Aid exit the Southeastern United States .
On September 19 , 2017 , the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) approved a fourth deal agreement , this time allowing Walgreens to purchase only 1,932 Rite - Aid stores for $ 4.38 billion .
The sale was completed on March 27 , 2018 .
Three distribution centers and related inventory will be transferred after September 1 , 2018 , when the stores will be rebranded to Walgreens .
The 1,932 stores have banners saying " Pharmacy now operated by Walgreens " in the meantime .

BY
ALBERTSONS
Section::::Attempted acquisition by Albertsons .
On February 20 , 2018 , Albertsons announced plans to acquire the remainder of Rite - Aid , including the 2,600 stores not acquired by Walgreens , in a merger of equals , subject to shareholder and regulatory approval .
