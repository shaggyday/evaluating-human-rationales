A running plot feature of the show entails Sunday dinner around the table in Frank Reagan 's Bay Ridge home at 8070 Harbor View Terrace .
Four generations gather here to eat and discuss their week , and the rule is that no one can take a first bite before every last family member is present and seated , and grace is said .
Discussion of the week 's events then ensues , often including the adults ' current work cases , and controversies therefrom are often discussed and hashed out by the entire family .
The grandchildren have questions which adults answer sometimes to humor them , sometimes to give their viewpoints .
At times the dialogue becomes heated and emotionally charged , but the family always remains loving and united in spite of any differences they encounter .
The Sunday dinner has been a Reagan family tradition for more than a century , and is well known to their friends and neighbors .
