RIGHT TO BUY
The Right to Buy scheme is a policy in the United Kingdom ( with the exception of Scotland since 1 August 2016 ) which gives secure tenants of councils and some housing associations the legal right to buy , at a large discount , the council house they are living in .
There is also a Right to Acquire for assured tenants of housing association homes built with public subsidy after 1997 , at a smaller discount .
About 1,500,000 homes in the UK have been sold in this manner since the introduction of the scheme in 1980 .
Supporters claim that the programme has given millions of households a tangible asset , secured their families ' finances and — by releasing cash to repay local authority debt — helped improve the public finances .
Critics claim that the policy compounded a housing shortage for people of low income , initiated a national house price bubble , and led ultimately to what is commonly recognised as the displacement and social cleansing of traditional communities .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Individual local authorities have always had the ability to sell council houses to their tenants , but until the early 1970s such sales were extremely rare .
The Labour Party initially proposed the idea of the right of tenants to own the house they live in , in their manifesto for the 1959 general election which they subsequently lost .
Later , the Conservative - controlled Greater London Council ( GLC ) of the late 1960s was persuaded by Horace Cutler , its Chairman of Housing , to create a general sales scheme .
Cutler disagreed with the concept of local authorities as providers of housing , and supported a free - market approach .
GLC housing sales were not allowed during the Labour administration of the mid-1970s , but picked up again once Cutler became Leader in 1977 .
They proved extremely popular .
Cutler was close to Margaret Thatcher ( MP for Finchley ) who made the right to buy council housing a Conservative Party policy nationally .
The policy was largely in place for the 1974 Conservative manifesto , but did not prove an asset in the two general elections that year because of high interest and mortgage repayment rates , as well as the growth of negative equity as house prices fell .
In the meantime , council house sales to tenants began to increase .
Some 7,000 were sold to their tenants during 1970 ; this soared to more than 45,000 in 1972 .
THATCHER POLICIES
Section::::Thatcher policies .
After Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister in May 1979 , the legislation to implement the Right to Buy was passed in the Housing Act 1980 .
Michael Heseltine , in his role as Secretary of State for the Environment , was in charge of implementing the legislation .
Some 6,000,000 people were affected ; about one in three actually purchased their housing unit .
Heseltine noted that " no single piece of legislation has enabled the transfer of so much capital wealth from the state to the people " .
He said the right to buy had two main objectives : to give people what they wanted , and to reverse the trend of ever - increasing dominance of the state over the life of the individual .
He said : " There is in this country a deeply ingrained desire for home ownership .
The Government believe that this spirit should be fostered .
It reflects the wishes of the people , ensures the wide spread of wealth through society , encourages a personal desire to improve and modernise one 's own home , enables parents to accrue wealth for their children and stimulates the attitudes of independence and self - reliance that are the bedrock of a free society . "
The sale price of a council house was based on its market valuation but also included a discount of between 33 % and 50 % ( up to 70 % for council flats ) , to reflect the rents paid by tenants and also to encourage take - up .
According to a government survey in 1988 , the average discount that had been offered was 44 % .
Mortgages involved no downpayments .
The legislation gave council tenants the right to buy their council house at a discounted value , depending on how long they had been living in the house , with the proviso that if they sold their house before a minimum period had expired they would have to pay back a proportion of the discount .
The sales were an attractive deal for tenants ; hundreds of thousands of homes were sold .
The policy became one of the major points of Thatcherism .
The policy proved immediately popular .
Some local Labour - controlled councils were opposed , but the legislation prevented them from blocking purchases , and gave them half the proceeds .
Sales were much higher in the south and east of England than in inner London and northern England .
Sales were restricted to general - needs housing ; adapted properties and those built specifically for older people were exempted from the scheme .
Half the proceeds of the sales were paid to the local authorities , but the government restricted authorities ' use of most of the money to reducing their debt until it was cleared , rather than spending it on building more homes .
The effect was to reduce the council housing stock , especially in areas where property prices were high , such as London and the south - east of England .
200,000 council houses were sold to their tenants in 1982 .
By 1987 , more than 1,000,000 council houses in the UK had been sold to their tenants , although the number of council houses purchased by tenants declined during the 1990s .
The Labour Party was initially against the sales , and pledged to oppose them at the 1983 general election , but then dropped its official opposition to the scheme in 1985 .
However , at the 1987 general election , the Conservative government warned voters that a Labour government would still abolish the scheme .
When Labour returned to power at the 1997 general election , it reduced the discount available to tenants in local authorities which had severe pressure on their housing stock ; this included almost the whole of London .
RIGHT TO BUY RULES AFTER 2005
Section::::Right to Buy rules after 2005 .
The Right to Buy rules were changed in 2005 .
Five years ' tenancy was now required for new tenants to qualify , and properties purchased after January 2005 could no longer immediately be placed on the open market should the owner decide to sell .
Such owners now had to approach their previous landlord ( council or housing association ) and offer them " first right of refusal " .
If the previous landlord was no longer in existence , for example in cases where the former landlord was a registered social landlord that has ceased business , then the property had to first be offered to the local housing authority .
The time in which a Right to Buy conveyance should take place was reduced from 12 months to 3 months .
The Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA ) now governed and regulated most types of mortgage - selling .
The FCA 's governance of Right to Buy purchases was partly to solve the widespread problem of Right to Buy mis - selling from brokers and solicitors alike .
Each had their own agenda and many were charging excessive fees which were then taken out of their client 's discount .
The above actions that have been taken coupled with the end of the boom period seem to have brought this problem under control .
In 2009 , the Localis think tank suggested , as part of a review of principles for social housing reform , that the right to buy should be extended into equity slivers , which could be part - earned through being a good tenant .
The qualifying period changed from 5 years to 3 years ( edited rbcdd3117 in 2018 )
RECENT CHANGES Section::::Recent changes .
At the 2011 Conservative Party Conference , David Cameron proposed to increase Right to Buy discounts in order to revitalise the housing market and generate receipts which could be spent on new housing .
Social housing professionals expressed concerns over the proposal .
As of 2 April 2012 , the Right to Buy discount was increased to a maximum of £ 75,000 or 60 % of the house value ( 70 % for a flat ) depending on which is lower .
In March 2013 , the maximum discount in London was increased to £ 100,000 .
The maximum amount of discount changes annually wef April 2017
it changed to £ 78,600.00 ( edited 2018 rbc dd3117 )
The maximum right to buy discount increases each financial year in line with CPI as at the previous September ( see separate document from the Right to Buy Team , Ministry of Housing , Communities and Local Government .
As the CPI in September 2017 was 3 % the new maximum discounts for Redditch in respect of the financial year 2018/19 will be £ 80,900 and applies to all applications made by the tenant on or after 6 April 2018 .
Any applications made before then are processed using the current discounts ( £ 78,600 ) .
In summary discount is a maximum of £ 80,900.00 from April 2018 ( rbcdd3117 )
The aim of the scheme is , for every additional home sold , a new home will be built for ' affordable rent ' at up to 80 % of market rent , aimed at maintaining the level of affordable housing while also increasing the number of properties available for those on the waiting list .
The five year tenancy criterion will remain , and should the property be sold within the first five years of the original sale , part or all of the discount will be required to be paid back .
The Housing and Planning Bill 2016 will if enacted extend right - to - buy to housing association tenants .
In July 2013 , the Scottish Government confirmed that
Right to Buy would be abolished in Scotland from 2017 .
It was in the end abolished as a part of the Housing ( Scotland ) Act 2014 from 1 August 2016 .
In the summer of 2017 , the Welsh Government proposed a law to abolish Right to Buy in Wales .
This law was passed by the Welsh Assembly in December 2017 , and the scheme will effectively end on 26 January 2019 .
CRITICISMS Section::::Criticisms .
The Right to Buy scheme has been criticised for the following reasons :
* Speculating investors were able to buy up council properties through deferred transaction agreements , hastening the rise in property costs ; * Commercially and socially valuable council assets being sold at below their market value or replacement cost ; * The remaining stock of council housing was concentrated in undesirable areas with little employment opportunity , further isolating and stigmatising the tenants .
A report published in January 2013 by London Assembly member Tom Copley , From Right to Buy to Buy to Let , showed that 36 % of homes sold under Right to Buy in London ( 52,000 homes ) were being rented by councils from private landlords , leading to criticisms that the scheme " represents incredibly poor value for money to taxpayers " since it " helped to fuel the increase in the housing benefit bill , heaped more pressure on local authority waiting lists and led to more Londoners being forced into the under - regulated private rented sector " .
A survey in 2013 showed around one third of Right to Buy houses were now owned by private landlords , while the son of the late Ian Gow ( Thatcher 's sometime housing minister ) owned some 40 houses .
In 2015 , Alan Murie concluded that " the proposed extension of right - to - buy could not easily be reconciled with the independence and charitable status of housing associations " , and that " extending the right - to - buy to housing association tenants revived a previous Parliamentary debate and raised questions about the legal position of charities and the risks faced by housing associations and their funders " .
A 2017 BBC survey of council areas where waiting lists were rising showed the councils had bought back houses they had been forced to sell , sometimes at many times the original price .
Housing charities criticised the lack of investment in affordable housing .
