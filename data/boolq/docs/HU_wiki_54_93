EMMA SWAN
Emma Swan is a fictional character in ABC 's television series Once Upon a Time .
She is portrayed by Jennifer Morrison , by Abby Ross as a teenager , and Mckenna Grace as a child .
Emma first appeared in the series 's pilot as a bail bond agent in Boston , Massachusetts until she meets her biological son Henry , whom she gave up for adoption 10 years before , and learns she is the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming .
Henry urges Emma to go to the fictional town of Storybrooke , Maine , to break a curse enacted by the Evil Queen and to restore the fairy tale characters ' happy endings .
The daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming , an ex - bail bonds collector , town sheriff of Storybrooke and Henry Mills ' biological mother .
Morrison described her character at the beginning of the first season as " broken , damaged and worldly " .
During the fourth season finale , " Operation Mongoose " , Emma absorbs the power of the Dark One into herself to save Storybrooke
In order to successfully create a dark version of Emma , Morrison explained that " In order to build Dark Emma , I 've been doing a bunch of research there with some of their mythology books and old fairy tale books and just looking back through the history of swans and the etymology of ' Swan ' " and explained that Emma 's rate of evolution " challenged [ her ] on a daily basis " .
Emma became the primary antagonist of the fifth season 's first half , until the end of the season 's eighth episode when her real plans are revealed .
Morrison 's portrayal of Emma has received praise , with some reviewers noting a feminist twist in the depiction of fairy tales and a strong female lead .
She is loosely based on the title character of the fairy tale
" The Ugly Duckling " , a swan which was lost and raised by ducks , before finding its birth family and recognizing its true nature , while her Dark One side is loosely based on Odile the Black Swan from the ballet Swan Lake .
It is revealed in the Season 6 episode " Tougher Than the Rest " that she chose the last name Swan when she was young after a friend mentioned that story .
CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND CASTING Section::::Character development and casting .
In early stages of the conception of the character , Emma 's name was Anna , and she was supposed to have three children , but she ended up having just Henry .
In the original script of the Pilot , she is described as " Late 20s .
Beautiful , with great strength behind classic features .
But also not quite at home in her skin . "
It was reported that actress Katee Sackhoff auditioned five times for the role of Emma , but according to her , the producers really wanted Morrison to play the part , and she accepted a role in the television series Longmire .
In the end , Morrison was hired for the part of Emma .
Morrison explained her character as someone who " help[s ] her son Henry whom she abandoned when he was a baby and who seems like he 's a little bit emotionally dysfunctional " , but noted that Emma does not start out believing in the fairytale universe .
Morrison has described Emma as being like an overgrown teenager who does not know how to properly do certain things , like eating or taking care of herself ; this is due to Emma not growing up in a family unit .
Morrison said that when she does not know what to do with Emma , she thinks , " What a 14-year - old boy would do ? "
Morrison has also stated that Emma is loosely based on " The Ugly Duckling " , and that Emma 's last name Swan is derived from this fairy tale .
According to the creators of the series , the name Swan is " very symbolic and fairy tale name
and it just felt right for her and for the journey we are creating for Emma .
"
After Emma became the " Dark One " at the end of the fourth season of the series , Morrison began doing research with mythology books and old fairy tale books , and looking back through the history of swans and the etymology of ' Swan ' to prepare for this new trait of her character .
For Morrison , it is a great opportunity to now play a villain and it is challenging for her to portray a character that is constantly evolving .

RECEPTION Ms. reviewing Emma Swan .
Jennifer Morrison has received praise for her portrayal of Emma .
In a review from the St. Louis Post - Dispatch , TV critic Gail Pennington had high marks for Morrison .
Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times gave excellent reviews for Morrison 's character :
" Her Emma is predictably cynical and prickly ‚Äì fairy - tale princess , my Aunt Fanny ‚Äì but she 's sharp and lively enough to keep audiences begging for ' just a few more pages ' before they go to bed . "
For TVLive , " Morrison does a nice job of mirroring the viewer 's disbelief of this fantastical dilemma ‚Äì and Emma looks like she could become a worthy adversary for Regina . "
For Daniel Fienberg , " Jennifer Morrison is very good in the lead " .
On less favorable reviews , Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe was not enthusiastic of Morrison 's portrayal and called her a " wooden lead " .
Several feminist outlets were pleased with the show for its feminist twist on fairy tales and with Emma being a strong female protagonist .
Genie Leslie at Feministing commented that Emma was a " badass " , that she liked how Emma was " very adamant that women be able to make their own decisions about their lives and their children " , and how Emma was a " well - rounded " character who was " feminine , but not ' girly .
Natalie Wilson from Ms. praised the show for a strong , " kick - butt " female lead , and for dealing with the idea of what makes a mother in a more nuanced fashion .
