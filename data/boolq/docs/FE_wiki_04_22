HIGH - ALTITUDE COOKING High - altitude cooking is cooking done at altitudes that are considerably higher than sea level .
At elevated altitudes , any cooking that involves boiling or steaming generally requires compensation for lower temperatures because the boiling point of water is lower at higher altitudes due to the decreased atmospheric pressure .
The effect starts to become relevant at altitudes above approximately .
Means of compensation include extending cooking times or using a pressure cooker to provide higher pressure inside the cooking vessel and hence higher temperatures .
BOILING
Section::::Boiling .
At sea level , water boils at .
For every increase in elevation , water 's boiling point is lowered by approximately 0.5 째 C .
At in elevation , water boils at just .
Boiling as a cooking method must be adjusted or alternatives applied .
Vegetables and some starches will simply take longer to cook , while rice and legumes ( beans ) usually require a pressure cooker .
Pasta will also require a pressure cooker .
METHODS USED
AT HIGH ALTITUDES
Section::::Methods used at high altitudes .
A pressure cooker is often used to compensate for the low atmospheric pressure at very high elevations .
Under these circumstances , water boils at temperatures significantly below 100 째 C and , without the use of a pressure cooker , may leave boiled foods undercooked .
Charles Darwin commented on this phenomenon in The Voyage of the Beagle :
