ACRE
The acre is a unit of land area used in the imperial and US customary systems .
It is traditionally defined as the area of one chain by one furlong ( 66 by 660 feet ) , which is exactly equal to 10 square chains , of a square mile , or 43,560 square feet , and approximately 4,047 m , or about 40 % of a hectare .
The acre is a statute measure in the United States and was formerly one in the United Kingdom and almost all countries of the former British Empire , although informal use continues .
The international symbol of the acre is ac .
In the United States both the international acre and the US survey acre are in use , but they differ by only two parts per million : see below .
The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land .
The acre , based upon the International yard and pound agreement of 1959 , is defined as exactly square metres .
Traditionally , in the Middle Ages , an acre was defined as the area of land that could be ploughed in one day by a yoke of oxen .
DESCRIPTION Section::::Description .
One acre equals ( 0.0015625 ) square mile , 4,840 square yards , 43,560 square feet or about ( see below ) .
While all modern variants of the acre contain 4,840 square yards , there are alternative definitions of a yard , so the exact size of an acre depends on which yard it is based .
Originally , an acre was understood as a selion of land sized at forty perches ( 660 ft , or 1 furlong ) long and four perches ( 66 ft ) wide ; this may have also been understood as an approximation of the amount of land a yoke of oxen could plough in one day .
A square enclosing one acre is approximately 69.57 yards , or 208 feet 9 inches ( ) on a side .
As a unit of measure , an acre has no prescribed shape ; any area of 43,560 square feet is an acre .
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL AND US SURVEY ACRES Section::::Differences between international and US survey acres .
In the international yard and pound agreement of 1959 the United States and five countries of the Commonwealth of Nations defined the international yard to be exactly 0.9144 metres .
By inference , an " international acre " may be declared as exactly square metres but it does not have a basis in any international agreement .
Both the international acre and the US survey acre contain of a square mile or 4,840 square yards , but alternative definitions of a yard are used ( see survey foot and survey yard ) , so the exact size of an acre depends upon which yard it is based .
The US survey acre is about square metres ; its exact value ( m ) is based on an inch defined by 1 metre =
39.37 inches exactly , as established by the Mendenhall Order .
Surveyors in the United States use both international and survey feet , and consequently , both varieties of acre .
Since the difference between the US survey acre and international acre is only about a quarter of the size of an A4 sheet of paper ( 0.016 square metres , 160 square centimetres or 24.8 square inches ) , it is usually not important which one is being discussed .
Areas are seldom measured with sufficient accuracy for the different definitions to be detectable .
USE Section::::Use .
The acre is commonly used in a number of current and former Commonwealth countries by custom , and in a few it continues as a statutory measure for legal transactions .
These include Antigua and Barbuda , American Samoa , The Bahamas , Belize , the British Virgin Islands , the Cayman Islands , Canada , Dominica , the Falkland Islands , Grenada , Ghana , Guam , the Northern Mariana Islands , Jamaica , Montserrat , Samoa , Saint Lucia , St. Helena , St. Kitts and Nevis , St. Vincent and the Grenadines , Turks and Caicos , the United Kingdom , the United States and the US Virgin Islands .
SOUTH ASIA Section::::South Asia .
In India , residential plots are measured in square feet while agricultural land is measured in acres .
In Sri Lanka , the division of an acre into 160 perches or 4 roods is common .
UNITED KINGDOM Section::::United Kingdom .
Its use as a primary unit for trade in the United Kingdom ceased to be permitted from 1 October 1995 , due to the 1994 amendment of the Weights and Measures Act , where it was replaced by the hectare though its use as a supplementary unit continues to be permitted indefinitely .
This was with exemption of Land registration , which records the sale and possession of land , in 2010
HM Land Registry ended its exemption .
The measure is still used to communicate with the public , and informally ( non - contract ) by the farming and property industries .
EQUIVALENCE TO OTHER UNITS OF AREA Section::::Equivalence to other units of area .
1 international acre is equal to the following metric units : * 0.40468564224 hectare ( A square with 100 m sides has an area of 1 hectare . )
*
4,046.8564224 square metres 1 United States survey acre is equal to : * 0.404687261 hectare * 4,046.87261 square metres ( 1 square kilometre is equal to 247.105 acres ) 1 acre ( both variants ) is equal to the following customary units :
* 66 feet × 660 feet ( 43,560 square feet ) * 10 square chains ( 1 chain =
66 feet =
22 yards =
4 rods = 100 links )
* 1 acre is approximately 208.71 feet × 208.71 feet ( a square )
* 4,840 square yards * 43,560 square feet * 160 perches .
A perch is equal to a square rod ( 1 square rod is 0.00625 acre ) * 4 roods * A furlong by a chain ( furlong 220 yards , chain 22 yards )
* 40 rods by 4 rods , 160 rods ( historically fencing was often sold in 40 rod lengths )
* ( 0.0015625 ) square mile ( 1 square mile is equal to 640 acres )
Perhaps the easiest way for US residents to envision an acre is as a rectangle measuring 88 yards by 55 yards ( of 880 yards by of 880 yards ) , about the size of a standard American football field .
To be more exact , one acre is 90.75 % of a 100-yd - long by 53.33-yd - wide American football field ( without the end zone ) .
The full field , including the end zones , covers about .
For residents of other countries , the acre might be envisioned as rather more than half of a Association football ( soccer ) pitch .
It may also be remembered as 1 % short of 44,000 square feet .
HISTORICAL ORIGIN Section::::Historical origin .
The word " acre " is derived from Old English originally meaning " open field " , cognate to west coast Norwegian and Swedish , German , Dutch , Latin , Sanskrit , and Greek ( ) .
In English , it was historically spelled aker .
A possible wording of the Act on the Composition of Yards and Perches , dating from around 1300 , is : It is ordained that 3 grains of barley dry and round do make an inch , 12 inches make 1 foot , 3 feet make 1 yard , 5 yards and a half make a perch , and 40 perches in length and 4 in breadth make an acre .
The acre was roughly the amount of land tillable by a yoke of oxen in one day .
This explains one definition as the area of a rectangle with sides of length one chain and one furlong .
A long , narrow strip of land is more efficient to plough than a square plot , since the plough does not have to be turned so often .
The word " furlong " itself derives from the fact that it is one furrow long .
Before the enactment of the metric system , many countries in Europe used their own official acres .
These were differently sized in different countries : for instance , the historical French acre was 4,221 square metres , whereas in Germany there were many variants of " acre " , differing between the German states : !
Place Name Area in m² width="140
" Area in ( local)square rods Statutory values for the acre were enacted in England , and subsequently the United Kingdom , by acts of :
* Edward I
* Edward III * Henry VIII *
George IV
* Queen Victoria – the British Weights and Measures Act of 1878 defined it as containing 4,840 square yards .
Historically , the size of farms and landed estates in the United Kingdom was usually expressed in acres ( or acres , roods , and perches ) , even if the number of acres was so large that it might conveniently have been expressed in square miles .
For example , a certain landowner might have been said to own 32,000 acres of land , not 50 square miles of land .
The acre is related to the square mile , with 640 acres making up one square mile .
One mile is 5280 feet ( 1760 yards ) .
In western Canada and the western United States , divisions of land area were typically based on the square mile , and fractions thereof .
If the square mile is divided into quarters , each quarter has a side length of mile ( 880 yards ) and is square mile in area , or 160 acres .
These subunits would typically then again be divided into quarters , with each side being mile long , and being of a square mile in area , or 40 acres .
In the United States , farmland was typically divided as such , and the phrase " the back 40 " would refer to the 40-acre parcel to the back of the farm .
Most of the Canadian Prairie Provinces and the US Midwest are on square - mile grids for surveying purposes .
LEGACY ACRES
* Customary acre – The customary acre was a measure of roughly similar size to the acre described above , but it was subject to considerable local variation similar to the variation found in carucates , virgates , bovates , nooks , and farundels .
However , there were more ancient measures that were also farthingales .
These may have been multiples of the customary acre , rather than the statute acre .
* Builder 's acre –
In US construction and real estate development , an area of 40,000 square feet .
Used to simplify math and for marketing , it is nearly 10 % smaller than a survey acre .
* Scottish acre , one of a number of obsolete Scottish units of measurement
* Irish acre =
7,840 square yards
* Cheshire acre =
10,240 square yards * Stremma or Greek acre ≈ 10,000 square Greek feet , but now set at exactly 1,000 square metres ( a similar unit was the zeugarion )
* Dunam or Turkish acre ≈ 1,600 square Turkish paces , but now set at exactly 1,000 square metres ( a similar unit was the çift )
* Actus quadratus or Roman acre
≈ 14,400 square Roman feet ( about 1,260 square metres ) * God 's Acre – a synonym for a churchyard .
*
Long acre the grass strip on either side of a road that may be used for illicit grazing .
