PLOT Section::::Plot .
In the fall of 1963 in New England , Odette " Odie " Sinclair is forcibly transferred by her parents to Miss Godard 's Preparatory School for Girls after her parents find out that she has planned to have sex with her boyfriend , Dennis .
Upon arrival to the school , which is run by the stern but kind headmistress Miss McVane , Odette is introduced to her roommates , the intelligent and charismatic Verena von Stefan and the promiscuous Tinka Parker .
Verena and Tinka are the school 's primary troublemakers ; both mock an uptight hall monitor named Abigail " Abby " Sawyer , who has a penchant for tattletaling , and Verena regularly buys cigarettes from a lunch cook and is constantly late for classes .
After a brief hazing period , Odie is welcomed into the D.A.R. ( Daughters of the American Ravioli ) , a club of several girls at the school who have greater aspirations than those of their peers ; the members congregate in the school 's attic , where they have access to canned ravioli stored above the cafeteria .
The club is led by Verena , and consists of several other girls , including Theresa " Tweety " Goldberg , a bulimic who self - induces vomiting by drinking ipecac syrup and plans to be a child psychologist ; and Maureen " Momo " Haines , a well - spoken science nerd and aspiring biologist .
Verena has plans to start a fashion magazine like Vogue , while Tinka plans to be an " actress - folk singer - slut " .
Odette declares her interest in politics , but pines to finish what she started with Dennis and lose her virginity .
The D.A.R. begins planning a rendezvous for Odie and Dennis , but when it is discovered that Miss Godard 's is considering going co - ed with the nearby St. Ambrose boys ' academy , the girls become divided on the matter and ultimately the club breaks up , leaving Verena and Momo to plan a sabotage for an upcoming dance with the St. Ambrose boys .
Meanwhile , the board of trustees for the school , which include Abby 's parents , deliberates on the matter .
Miss McVane detests the merger , but can do little about it because of the school 's financial problems .
As the St. Ambrose dance arrives , Verena and Momo concoct a plan to cast the boys ' academy in a bad light , by spiking the fruit punch with alcohol from the chemistry lab and feeding them Tweety 's ipecac to induce vomiting during their choir performance ; Verena then plants empty liquor bottles in their school bus .
The same night , Dennis arrives at the academy dressed in a St. Ambrose uniform and meets Odette for their rendezvous in the attic of the school .
Tweety and Tinka have a change of heart on the co - ed integration after Tweety is humiliated by some St. Ambrose students .
With the help of a group of teenage male townies called " The Flat Critters " , led by Snake who has a crush on Tinka , they end up sending the intoxicated St. Ambrose boys home with a poor reputation .
Miss McVane recognizes Verena as the mastermind behind the sabotage .
Despite Miss McVane 's appreciation for Verena 's efforts , she is forced to expel Verena for having been caught fraternizing in her undergarments with a St. Ambrose boy .
The following week at the end of the year ceremony , the announcement of the merger is made by Mrs. Sawyer , much to the disapproval of the girls , including Abby .
The students , led by Odie , hole up inside the school dormitories and demand a student body vote count as a single vote on the board of trustees .
Meanwhile , a media circus surrounds the school , and the board of trustees agree to a student vote .
Ultimately , the votes against the integration
outnumber those for it , and the students donate their personal savings to help with the school 's debt .
In a humorous epilogue prior to the credits , the following is revealed : Verena goes on to publish Moi , one of the most - read women 's publications in the world ; Odette becomes a congresswoman and declares war on the tobacco industry ; Momo is a scientist developing the first male oral contraceptive ; Tinka , a famous actress , comes out to Barbara Walters in a 1997 interview ; Tweety became a psychologist and wrote a best - seller about bulimia ; Abby , a radical political activist , is serving a prison sentence for a 1970 bank holdup ; and Miss Godard 's is still a girls school .

CRITICAL RESPONSE
Section::::Critical response .
A.O. Scott of The New York Times noted that the film " mixes such prim old - fashioned naughtiness with more consequential misbehavior ...
All
I Wanna Do lurches between girl - power melodrama and bratty farce , but the ungainliness is part of the film 's charm . "
He also noted that the film is " surprisingly pleasant , thanks to smart , unstereotyped performances -- especially by Ms. Hoffmann and Ms. Dunst -- and the filmmaker 's evident respect and affection for her characters . "
Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club favorably reviewed the film , noting that in its final act it " gains focus and momentum , becoming less a nostalgic celebration of female bonding than a boldly feminist teen sex comedy that is n't above the occasional group - vomiting scene .
It improves steadily as it goes along , right up through an enormously satisfying ending that combines rousing rhetoric about the price of gender inequity and the power of group solidarity â€” and throws in a rowdy snobs vs. slobs setpiece worthy of Animal House . "
