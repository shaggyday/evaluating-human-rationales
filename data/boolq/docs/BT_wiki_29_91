FUN DIP Fun Dip is a candy manufactured by The Willy Wonka Candy Company , a brand owned by Nestlé .
The candy has been on the market in the United States and Canada since the 1940s and was originally called Lik - M - Aid .
It was originally manufactured by Fruzola , and then Sunline Inc. , through their Sunmark Brands division , which was purchased by Nestlé in January 1989 .
It comes in many different flavors with candy sticks that are included .
Fun Dip is similar to fellow Wonka product Pixy Stix , but sold in small pouches , rather than paper or plastic straws .
When called Lik - M - Aid , it consisted of 4 packets of flavored and colored sugar .
When rebranded in the 1970s as Fun Dip , two edible candy sticks called " Lik - A - Stix " were added .
While the original flavors consisted of lime , cherry and grape , the most common flavors are cherry , grape , and a raspberry / apple combination that turns from blue when dry to green when wet with saliva or water .
It also comes in sour flavors , including sour watermelon , sour apple , and sour lemonade .
There is also orange flavored Fun Dip .
Packets with one stick and two flavors were once the standard , and packets with only one or two flavors are still available with less prominence than the now - standard three - flavor package .
EATING STYLE
Section::::Eating style .
Fun Dip varies greatly from many other types of candy in that it is meant to be eaten over a considerable amount of time , compared to other candies that are usually bite size or consumed quickly .
The intended purpose is to wet the sticks ( called Lik - A - Stix ) , using saliva , and then collect some of the sugar and lick the sugar off of the Lik - A - Stix .
When all the sugar is gone , the Lik - A - Stix is eaten .
