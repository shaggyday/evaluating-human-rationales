Four days later , in a 114–101 win over the Nets , Curry became the seventh player in Warriors history to make 5,000 career field goals , joining Chamberlain , Barry , Mullin , Arizin , Jeff Mullins and Nate Thurmond .

Three titles ...
Wherever that puts us in the conversation in the history of the NBA ...
I 'm a three - time champ .
"
Rohan Nadkarni of Sports Illustrated argued that " the Golden State dynasty started with Stephen Curry .
He , for numerous reasons stretching from his incredible talent to his previous ankle injuries , put the Warriors in place to win their third championship in four seasons . "
2018–19 SEASON Section::::2018–19 season .

NATIONAL TEAM
CAREER Section::::National team career .
Curry 's first experience with the United States national team came at the 2007 FIBA Under-19 World Championship , where he helped Team USA capture the silver medal .
In 2010 , he was selected to the senior squad , playing limited minutes at the 2010 FIBA World Championship ( known later as FIBA Basketball World Cup ) as the United States won the gold medal in an undefeated tournament .
In 2014 , he took on a larger role with the team , helping them to another undefeated tournament at the 2014 World Cup and scoring 10 points in the final game .
On June 6 , 2016 , Curry withdrew from consideration for the 2016 Olympics in Brazil , citing ankle and knee ailments as the major reason behind the decision .
PLAYER PROFILE
Section::::Player profile .
Standing at 6 feet 3 inches tall ( 1.91 m ) and weighing 190 pounds ( 86 kg ) , Curry plays almost exclusively at the point guard position and has career averages of 23.1 points , 6.8 assists , 4.4 rebounds , and 1.8 steals per game .
He has been selected to four All - NBA Teams and voted league MVP twice .
Known for his humility and work ethic , Curry is considered to be an important leader within the Warriors organization .
He is said to have played a significant role in the recruitment of former MVP Kevin Durant to the Warriors .
Curry is known for his elite shooting ability ; he is able to score in great volume from underneath the rim all the way to near half - court .
He is considered by many to be the greatest shooter in NBA history .
Using an unorthodox jump shot , he is able to get the ball out of his hands in under half a second by releasing it on the way up , adding extra arc to his shot and making it difficult to block .
In addition to his quick release , he puts extra pressure on defenses with his long range , leading the NBA in field goals made from beyond 28 feet in 2016 .
As of April 2018 , he ranks fourth in NBA history in career three - point field goal percentage and holds four of the top five seasons in terms of total three - pointers made .
He is also the fastest player in league history to make 2,000 career three - pointers , doing so in 227 fewer games than the previous record - holder .
A clutch scorer , he often shoots at his best in high - pressure moments , and takes game - winning shots .
Curry is credited with revolutionizing the game of basketball by inspiring basketball teams , ranging from high school to the NBA , to regularly employ the three - point shot as part of their winning strategy .
Analysts have referred to him as " the Michael Jordan of the three - point era , " stating that he did for the three - point shot what Jordan did for the dunk .
The Guardian 's Robert O'Connell cites Curry 's February 27 , 2013 game against the New York Knicks , in which he made 11 of 13 shots from behind the arc en route for a 54-point performance , as the start of the three - point era .
The era has been referred to as " The Steph Effect " and " the NBA 's Three - Point Revolution .
" The increase in three - point shooting is partly due to NBA teams incorporating it in their attempts to defeat the Warriors or copy the Warriors style of play , and due to young people wanting to imitate Curry 's shooting range .
Although this has led to players becoming good at or improving their three - point shot , it has also set unrealistic standards because Curry 's range is unique .
In response to high school players imitating him , Curry stated , " I 'm pretty sure that the coaches are being put in a position where they are having to reel some guys back in and make sure that they understand that you got to work on this stuff .
It takes time . "
Jesse Dougherty of The Washington Post stated , " Coaches have to explain that while Curry 's skill set is something to aspire to , his game is built on fundamentals .
They have to explain that , while the Warriors have become the NBA 's gold standard and make all those social - media - bound plays , the root of their success is ball movement . "
NBA analysts state that Curry 's elite scoring ability creates a " gravity " effect , forcing opposing defenders to double - team him even when he does not have the ball , which creates mismatches that his teammates are able to exploit .
With Curry , the Warriors average 10.8 isolations per game ; without Curry , they average 15.3 isolations per game .
His absence slows the Warriors offense down and leads to less passing and ball movement .
With Curry , the Warriors average 1.05 points every shot that comes after an off - ball screen ; without Curry , it drops to 0.95 points per game .
His absence makes it much easier for defenders to switch on screens .
Of Curry 's success with or without other elite teammates , Tom Haberstroh of NBC Sports stated , " You can pluck All - Star after All - Star off the court like flower petals , and the Steph - led Warriors will still dominate like a champion .
He 's that transcendent of a player .
[ ... ] The Warriors go from plus-16.9 to plus-14.8 to plus-13.9 to plus-14.3 as you keep removing an All - Star from Curry .
But as these numbers show , Curry is impervious .
He 's teammate - agnostic .
For those that think Curry would struggle in another organization or in another system , it 's clear : He is the system . "
Curry is also a high - percentage free throw shooter , with a career free throw percentage of over 90 % through the 2017–18 season , the third highest in NBA history .
He is the Warriors ' all - time free - throw leader , and has led the NBA in free throw percentage four times .
Although capable of stealing the ball , having led the league in steals for the 2015–16 season , Curry is not considered to be an elite defender , and his teammates frequently take the more difficult defensive assignments .
PERSONAL LIFE Section::::Personal life .
On July 30 , 2011 , Curry married longtime girlfriend and Toronto native Ayesha Alexander in Charlotte .
Together , they have two daughters and a son , Riley ( b. 2012 ) , Ryan ( b. 2015 ) , and Canon ( b. 2018 ) .
They currently reside in Alamo , California .
Curry 's younger brother , Seth , is also a professional basketball player , and his younger sister , Sydel , played volleyball at Elon University .
Curry has been outspoken about his Christian faith .
Curry spoke about his faith during his MVP speech by saying , " People should know who I represent and why I am who I am , and that 's because of my Lord and Savior . "
He also said the reason that he pounds his chest and points up is that he has a " heart for God " and as a reminder that he plays for God .
On some of his " Curry One " basketball shoes , there is a lace loop scripted " 4:13 " .
It is a reference to the Bible verse Philippians 4:13 , which reads " I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me " .
Curry has a tattoo of First Corinthians 13:8 in Hebrew on his wrist ( " Love never fails ... " ) .
Curry is also an investor in Active Faith , a Christian sports apparel brand .
During the 1992 All - Star Weekend , Curry 's father entrusted him to Biserka Petrović , mother of future Hall of Fame player Dražen Petrović , while Dell competed in the Three - Point Contest .
Following the 2015 NBA Finals , Curry gave Biserka one of his Finals - worn jerseys , which will reportedly be added to the collection of the Dražen Petrović Memorial Center , a museum to the late player in the Croatian capital of Zagreb .
CHARITY Section::::Charity .
In 2012 , Curry started donating three insecticide - treated mosquito nets for every three - pointer he made to the United Nations Foundation 's Nothing
But Nets campaign to combat malaria .
He was first introduced to the malaria cause by Davidson teammate Bryant Barr when they were both in school .
Curry visited the White House in 2015 and delivered a five - minute speech to dignitaries as part of President Barack Obama 's launch of his President 's Malaria Initiative strategy for 2015–2020 .
In 2015 , Curry wore sneakers that had Deah Shaddy Barakat 's name on them ( one of the victims of the 2015 Chapel Hill shooting ) .
According to his sister Suzanne , Deah Barakat was known for his " love for basketball and anything Steph Curry .
" Deah 's number for his intramural basketball team at North Carolina State University was Curry 's No . 30 and he posed for a photo that was similar to one that Curry did for GQ .
Curry said that Barakat 's family " did a great job of reaching out to me and making me aware of the details of his life and personality [ ... ]
It was really kind of a cool deal to be able to use the platform yesterday to honor Deah and his family [ ... ]
I 'm going to send them the shoes I wore yesterday .
And hopefully they know that I 've been thinking about them . "
Also in 2015 , after winning the MVP award following his impressive season , Curry donated his prize vehicle — a 2016 Kia Sorento — to the East Oakland Youth Development Center , a local non - profit organization located in the backyard of Oracle Arena .

Curry is currently one of the most successful players in the NBA , and he has also become an international celebrity , on par with four - time MVP LeBron James .

ESPN has ranked Curry among the most famous international athletes , while Forbes has ranked him among the world 's highest - paid celebrities for his endorsements .
Monte Poole of NBC Sports found Curry to be " the most human of superstars , " with a childlike aura to him when he plays with success .
His fanbase ranges from very young children to the elderly , and casual or committed fans enjoy his style of play .
Poole stated that " the joy factor exponentially increases " when Curry is on the court and that " the sight of this relatively ordinary specimen sending much bigger players into silent surrender is an intoxicant for the Warriors and their fans . "
Poole added , " No NBA athlete has a larger contingent of fans at every arena , lining up
20- and 30-deep hoping for a glimpse , if not an autograph .
This crazy popularity is why his jersey sales consistently rank No . 1 , why he was voted to be the captain of the Western Conference
All - Star team and why 9-year - old girls feel comfortable enough to write letters asking for his help -- and actually get it . " BUSINESS INTERESTS
