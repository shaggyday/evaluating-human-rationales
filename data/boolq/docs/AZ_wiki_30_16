PLOT Section::::Plot .
Muriel Heslop ( Toni Collette ) , who loves the music of ABBA , is the target of ridicule by her shallow snobby friends Tania , Cheryl , Nicole and Janine , for her awkwardness , fashion sense , and embarrassing antics .
She also is a perpetual daydreamer who yearns for a glamorous wedding to a man who will help get her out of the dead - end seaside tourist town of Porpoise Spit , improve her personal life , and free her from her domineering father , Bill ( Bill Hunter ) , a corrupt politician who verbally lashes out at his subservient and depressed wife , Betty , and their unambitious children at every opportunity .
Muriel attends the wedding of Tania and Chook .
During the wedding reception Muriel sees Nicole and Chook having sex in a room .
Chook 's cousin Dianna calls the police on Muriel for stealing a dress that she is currently wearing at the wedding .
Dianna witnessed Muriel stealing the dress at a store before the wedding .
Muriel is escorted out the wedding reception by police .
Soon after , Muriel 's " friends " break off their friendship with her and plan a holiday to Hibiscus Island without her to cheer up Tania , who found out that Chook has cheated on her with another woman called Rose Biggs .
Tania does n't know that Chook had also been cheating on her with Nicole .
While out to dinner , Muriel and her family run into Bill 's rumored mistress , Deidre Chambers , who has done well in a cosmetics pyramid scheme , and she recruits Muriel .
The following day , Betty writes a blank check for Muriel to cash into the scheme .
Instead , Muriel uses the check to withdraw $ 12,000 from her parents ' bank account to follow her supposed friends to Hibiscus Island ; when they discover Muriel there , they angrily tell her to leave them alone .
Later on the island , Muriel runs into Rhonda Epinstalk ( Rachel Griffiths ) , a fellow social outcast from her high school days who is more outgoing and adventurous .
Muriel tells Rhonda that Tania and the other girls are at the resort too .
Rhonda resolves to confront them , as she was also bullied by Tania in high school .
Rhonda tells Tania that Muriel saw Nicole having sex with Chook , which later results in a physical fight between Tania and Nicole .
During the trip , Muriel lies to Rhonda about being engaged .
At the end of her holiday , Muriel returns home and is confronted by Betty over the missing money .
Muriel immediately leaves the house and moves to Sydney , where she shares a flat with Rhonda and changes her name to " Mariel . "
She also gets a job at a video store and briefly dates an awkward but kind man , Brice Nobes , whom she meets at the store .
During one wild weekend night , Rhonda suddenly falls down , apparently paralyzed .
While waiting in the emergency room in Sydney , Muriel calls her family home and learns the Australian Federal Police are investigating her father for corruption .
Rhonda discovers she has a malignant tumor pressing on her spine and requires urgent surgery .
Muriel then uses Rhonda 's health crisis as the basis of a deception to obtain a free photo shoot from a bridal shop .
During one of Rhonda 's rehab sessions , Muriel promises that she will take care of Rhonda and that they will never need to return to their hometown .
However , Rhonda later discovers that Muriel has tried on every wedding dress in Sydney and confronts her , forcing Muriel to confess the depth of her deceptions .
Rhonda 's cancer returns , necessitating more severe surgery and leaving her permanently paralyzed .
Still desperate to get married , Muriel enters into a conspiracy to commit visa fraud , marrying South African swimmer David Van Arkle so that he can stay in Australia and compete in the upcoming Olympics ; she is paid $ 5,000 by David 's parents for her part in the scheme .
At Muriel 's elaborate wedding , her former so - called friends serve as the bridesmaids with the exception of Nicole ; Muriel had asked Rhonda to be a bridesmaid but Rhonda turned her down , instead relegated to being a guest .
Tania tells Rhonda that her and Chook are Divorcing .
Bill attends with Deidre .
Betty arrives late to the wedding , missing the actual ceremony ; Muriel does n't notice her at the back of the church and walks past .
Rhonda moves back to Porpoise Spit with her mother as she can no longer live in Sydney without any help , and Muriel moves in with David .
David soon makes his contempt for Muriel known , and Muriel realizes their relationship will always be platonic .
Meanwhile , back in Porpoise Spit , a distraught Betty accidentally shoplifts a pair of sandals from a supermarket .
Dianna , who saw Betty put on the shoes , follows Betty around the store and to the cashier .
Dianna calls the police .
Bill arranges with the police for the charges to disappear and takes Betty home .
In the car Betty pleads with Bill that her actions were not intentional and that she needs help .
Bill ignores Betty 's cries and announces his intention to divorce her and marry Deidre .
Betty sets the backyard on fire ( after constantly asking one of her sons to mow it ) , then commits suicide by taking sleeping pills .
Realising her constant marginalisation broke Betty 's will to live , Muriel breaks down .
David comforts her , and they finally consummate their marriage .
Her mother 's death has forced Muriel to take a hard look at her life , and the next morning , Muriel asks David , who has decided that he likes having her around , for a divorce .
She leaves and wishes him good luck in the Olympics .
Bill asks Muriel to stay and help raise her siblings ; she refuses .
She repays $ 5,000 ( the money she was paid for marrying David ) of the $ 12,000 she stole , saying that she will repay the rest when she gets a job back in Sydney .
She also states that she will no longer put up with his rude and emotionally abusive treatment of her and her siblings .
Although a little taken aback by her new , more assertive personality , he nonetheless respects her decision and gives her his blessing to move back to Sydney .
Bill reveals to Muriel that Deidre no longer wants to marry him because she does not want to take care of his kids .
Bill also resigned from the city council after losing the campaign and being investigated .
He is now unemployed .
Muriel visits Rhonda at her mother 's house , where Muriel 's former tormentors are also condescendingly visiting , and offers to take her back to Sydney .

The critical consensus states , " Heartfelt and quirky , though at times broad , Muriel 's Wedding mixes awkward comedy , oddball Australian characters , and a nostalgia - heavy soundtrack .
"
The film also has a score of 63 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 14 critics indicating ' Generally favorable reviews ' Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun - Times said the film " is merciless in its portrait of provincial society , and yet has a huge affection for its misfit survivors ...
[ it ] has a lot of big and little laughs in it , but also a melancholy undercurrent , which reveals itself toward the end of the film in a series of surprises and unexpected developments ...
The film 's good heart keeps it from ever making fun of Muriel , although there are moments that must have been tempting . "
Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle stated , " With such recent hits as Strictly Ballroom and Priscilla , Queen of the Desert , Australia seems to be cornering the market for odd but delightful comedies laced with substance and romance .
The latest , Muriel 's Wedding , is another bright , occasionally brilliant , example ...
The movie is much meatier than its larky comic sheen leads you to think at first ...
There 's poignant drama in this brash , sometimes overstated film , and Muriel 's transformation is truly touching . "
Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called it " exuberantly funny ...
a crowd pleaser that spices a tired formula with genuine feeling ...
In the final scenes , when Hogan dares to let his humor turn edgy , Collette 's performance gains in force , and Muriel 's Wedding becomes a date you want to keep . "
