OVERTIME ( ICE HOCKEY )
Overtime is a method of determining a winner in an ice hockey game when the score is tied after regulation .
The main methods of determining a winner in a tied game are the overtime period ( commonly referred to as overtime ) , the shootout , or a combination of both .
If league rules dictate a finite time in which overtime may be played , with no penalty shoot - out to follow , the game 's winning team may or may not be necessarily determined .
OVERTIME PERIODS Section::::Overtime periods .
Overtime periods are extra periods beyond the third regulation period during a game , where normal hockey rules apply .
Although in the past , full - length overtime periods were played , overtimes today are golden goal ( a form of sudden death ) , meaning that the game ends immediately when a player scores a goal .
NORTH AMERICAN OVERTIME Section::::North American overtime .
From November 21 , 1942 , when overtime ( an extra period of 10 minutes duration ) was eliminated due to war time restrictions and continuing until the 1983–84 season , all NHL regular - season games tied after 60 minutes of play ended as ties .
On June 23 , 1983 , the NHL introduced a regular - season overtime period of five minutes .
If the five - minute overtime period ended with no scoring , the game ended as a tie .
( The World Hockey Association had used a 10-minute , sudden death regular season overtime period during its seven - year existence . )
In the first games to go to overtime , on October 5 , 1983 , the Minnesota North Stars and Los Angeles Kings skated to a 3–3 tie , and the Detroit Red Wings and Winnipeg Jets tied 6–6 .
The first regular - season game decided by overtime was on October 8 , 1983 , as the New York Islanders beat the Washington Capitals 8–7 .
In 1987–88 and since 1995 , the American Hockey League has awarded teams one point in the standings for an overtime loss ( OTL ) .
In 1998 , the AHL introduced a rule where teams will play the five - minute overtime period with four skaters and a goaltender , rather than at full strength ( five skaters ) , except in two - man advantage situations .
In a two - man advantage situation , the team with the advantage will play with five skaters against three skaters .
The rule was popular and adopted by the NHL and ECHL the next season .
Alex Ovechkin has the record for most NHL overtime goals with 20 .
In the Stanley Cup playoffs and in all one - game playoffs , overtime periods are played like regulation periods except for the golden goal rule – in an overtime period , the game ends when one team scores a goal ; the teams are at full strength ( five skaters , barring penalties ) , there is no shootout , and each overtime period is 20 minutes with full intermissions between overtime periods .
Three of the game 's legendary players , Mark Messier ( 109 playoff goals ) , Mario Lemieux ( 77 goals ) , and Gordie Howe ( 68 goals ) never scored a playoff overtime goal .
In many leagues ( including the NHL for regular - season games since the 2005–06 season ) and in international competitions , a failure to reach a decision in a single overtime may lead to a shootout .
Some leagues may eschew overtime periods altogether and end games in shootout should teams be tied at the end of regulation .
In the ECHL , the AHL , and the Southern Professional Hockey League , regular season overtime periods are played three on three for one five - minute period , with penalties resulting in the opponents skating one additional player on ice ( up to two additional players ) for each penalty .
Prior to the 2014–15 season , the AHL set the overtime period at seven minutes , but reverted to the now - standard five - minute period the following year .
The idea of using 3-on-3 skaters for the entirety of a five - minute overtime period for a regular season game was adopted by the NHL on June 24 , 2015 , for use in the 2015–16 NHL season .
INTERNATIONAL OVERTIME Section::::International overtime .
In IIHF play , rules for overtime depend on the stage of the competition .
For a round robin or preliminary round game that goes to overtime , the teams will play a maximum of five minutes of 3-on-3 hockey in the " golden goal " format .
If no one scores in the five minute overtime , a three - round shootout will decide the winner .
In the case of a playoff game or a bronze medal game , the teams will play a maximum of ten minutes of 4-on-4 hockey in the " golden goal " format .
If there is no score in the overtime , a five - round shootout will decide the winner .
If the gold medal game of a top category IIHF championship goes to overtime , the teams will play a maximum of twenty minutes of 5-on-5 hockey in the " golden goal " format .
If there is no winner after the overtime , a five - round shootout will decide the winner .
In all cases , the teams must change ends , and defend the same side that they did in the second period .
SHOOTOUT INTERNATIONAL SHOOTOUTS Section::::Shootout .
Section::::International shootouts .
In international competition , shootouts ( or more formally , game - winning shots ( GWS ) , and , in some European countries , bullets , or bullits ) , are often used .
Each coach selects three skaters from their team to take penalty shots one at a time against the opposing goaltender , with teams alternating shots .
Each team gets one shot per round .
The winner is the team with more goals after three rounds or the team that amasses an unreachable advantage before then ( ex .
a team gains a two - goal lead with only one round left ) .
If the shootout is tied after three rounds , tie - breaker rounds are played one at a time ( with each team taking one additional shot ) until there is a winner .
The IIHF first adopted the game - winning - shot procedure in 1992 when a new playoff procedure in the Winter Olympics and World Championships required a winner for each game .
At that time , the shootout was five rounds and only used for knock - out games .
In 2006 , it was reduced to three rounds and used for all games , eliminating the possibility of tied games at IIHF events .
Tie - breaker rounds are still used as needed , and the same or new players can take the tie - break shots , which is also done in reverse order .
As of May 2016 , all IIHF preliminary round games that are not decided by overtime , are decided by a three - round shootout .
However , all playoff , bronze medal games and gold medal games of IIHF top level championships ( especially the Olympics ) are decided by five round shootouts .
NORTH AMERICAN SHOOTOUTS
Section::::North American shootouts .
Most lower minor leagues ( ECHL , Central , UHL ) have featured a shootout where , at the end of regulation , a shootout similar to the international tournament format is used .
However , in 2000 , the ECHL adopted the AHL 's four - on - four overtime before the shootout .
For the 2004–05 AHL season , the AHL adopted a five - man shootout , which was first used in that league in 1986–87 .
The standard five - man shootout is used after four - on - four overtime for all minor leagues in North America .
The AHL switched to the NHL formatted three - man shootout for the 2014–15 season .
The Central Collegiate Hockey Association added the shootout as of the 2008–09 season .
Following the lead of minor leagues , as of the 2005–06 season , the NHL ends exhibition and regular season games still tied after a five - minute - length , three - skaters - per - side overtime period ( as of the 2015–16 NHL season onwards ) with a shootout .
The NHL format is a three - round shootout with tiebreaker rounds as needed .
All skaters ( except goalies ) on a team 's roster must shoot before any player can shoot a second time .
On December 16 , 2014 the longest shootout in NHL history went to 20 rounds before Nick Bjugstad of the Florida Panthers scored to defeat the Washington Capitals ; the previous record was 15 rounds .
The shootout is not used in the playoffs for any North American league .
Instead , full 20-minute overtime periods are played until one team scores a goal .
In the National Hockey League and American Hockey League All - Star Skills Competitions , the competition ends in a penalty shootout known as the Breakaway Relay .
TACTICS Section::::Tactics .
Tactics are very important during penalty shots and overtime shootouts for both the shooter and the goalie .
Both shooters and goalies commonly consult their teammates and coaches for advice on the opposing player 's style of play .
Shooters often consider the goalie 's strengths and weaknesses ( such as a fast glove or stick save ) , preferred goaltending style ( such as butterfly or stand - up ) and method of challenging the shooter .
Goaltenders often consider the shooter 's shot preference , expected angle of attack , a patented move a shooter commonly uses and even handedness of the shooter .
Most shooters attempt to out - deke the goalie in order to create a better scoring chance .
Former Detroit Red Wings forward Pavel Datsyuk and New York
Rangers forward Martin St. Louis are examples of players who commonly use this tactic .
However , it is not uncommon for a shooter to simply shoot for an opening without deking .
This is commonly referred to as sniping .
This is most commonly performed when a goalie challenges a shooter by giving them an open hole ( by keeping a glove , pad or stick out of position or being out of sound goaltending position altogether to tempt the shooter to aim for the given opening ) .
Former NHL forwards Markus Näslund and Brett
Hull are two players commonly referred to as snipers .
Very rarely a shooter may take a slapshot or wrist shot from the point or top of the slot .
This is almost exclusively performed when a shooter either has a high level of confidence in their shot or they attempt to catch the goalie by surprise .
Retired player Brian Rolston , Detroit Red Wings winger Todd Bertuzzi , Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Chris Pronger , and Vancouver Canucks winger Daniel Sedin have all used this tactic with success .
