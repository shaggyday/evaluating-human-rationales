MARRIAGE IN CANADA
The Parliament of Canada has exclusive legislative authority over marriage and divorce in Canada under section 91(26 ) of the Constitution Act , 1867 .
However section 92(12 ) of the Constitution Act , 1867 gives the provincial legislatures the power to pass laws regulating the solemnization of marriage .
In 2001 there were 146,618 marriages in Canada , down 6.8 % from 157,395 in 2000 .
Prince Edward Island had the highest crude marriage rate ( 6.5 per 1,000 people ) and Quebec had the lowest ( 3.0 ) .
Marriage ceremonies in Canada can be either civil or religious .
Marriages may be performed by members of the clergy , marriage commissioners , judges , justices of the peace or clerks of the court , depending on the laws of each province and territory regulating marriage solemnization .
In 2001 , the majority of Canadian marriages ( 76.4 % ) were religious , with the remainder ( 23.6 % ) being performed by non - clergy .
Same - sex marriage has been legal in Canada nationally since 2005 .
Court decisions , starting in 2003 , had already legalized same - sex marriage in eight out of ten provinces and one of three territories .

Section::::Consanguinity .
The federal Marriage ( Prohibited Degrees )
Act prevents the following persons from getting married : CONSENT OF THE SPOUSES Section::::Consent of the spouses .
Both parties must freely consent .
Forcing somebody to get married is a criminal offense under s. 293.1 of the Criminal Code .
In addition , s. 2.1 of the Civil Marriage Act stipulates , " Marriage requires the free and enlightened consent of two persons to be the spouse of each other . "
AGE OF THE SPOUSES Section::::Age of the spouses .
Since 2015 , federal law has set the absolute minimum marriageable age at 16 .
Provinces and territories may set a minimum age higher than that .
In Canada the age of majority is set by province / territory at 18 or 19 , so minors under this age have additional restrictions ( i.e. parental and court consent ) .
Section 293.2 of the Criminal Code also addresses marriages of individuals under the age of 16 , reading : Everyone who celebrates , aids or participates in a marriage rite or ceremony knowing that one of the persons being married is under the age of 16 years is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years .
Section 2.2 of the Civil Marriage Act also states : No person who is under the age of 16 years may contract marriage .
These provisions were enacted in 2015 .
Before 2015 , it was possible for children less than 16 years old to get married in some jurisdictions of Canada , with parental consent or a court order .
( The legal marriage age with parental consent was possibly as low as 7 in some Canadian jurisdictions . )
