RIDE LIKE THE WIND
" Ride Like the Wind " is a song written and recorded by American singer - songwriter Christopher Cross .
It was released in February 1980 as the lead single from his Grammy - winning self - titled debut album .

HISTORY Section::::History .
The song tells the story of a condemned criminal on the run to Mexico .
Told from a first - person point of view , it describes how an outlaw and convicted multiple murderer , on the run from a death - by - hanging sentence , has to " ride like the wind " to reach " the border of Mexico , " where , presumably , the posse apparently in pursuit of him will not be able to reach him .
Cross was on acid when he wrote the lyrics .
" We were living in Houston at the time , and on the way down to Austin to record the songs , it was just a beautiful Texas day .
I took acid .
So I wrote the words on the way down from Houston to Austin . "
In 1999 , the satirical newspaper The Onion published a story with the headline , " Christopher Cross Finally Reaches Mexican Border " ; the headline was a reference to the song , and the three - sentence story made several specific allusions to the lyrics .
Cross appreciated the honor .
