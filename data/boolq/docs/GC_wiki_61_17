CONGRESSIONAL BASEBALL GAME
The Congressional Baseball Game for Charity is an annual baseball game played each summer by members of the United States Congress .
The game began as a casual event among colleagues in 1909 and eventually evolved into one of Washington , D.C. 's most anticipated annual pastimes , according to the House of Representatives Office of the Historian .
In the game , Republicans and Democrats form separate teams and play against each other .
Today , the game raises money for three local charities : The Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Washington , The Washington Nationals Dream Foundation , and The Washington Literacy Center .
The game is usually attended by crowds of congressional staffers and , occasionally , even dignitaries and US Presidents .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The 1909 game was organized by Representative John Tener of Pennsylvania , a former professional baseball player .
The Boston Daily Globe observed , " The game was brewing for weeks and the members of the house were keyed up a high pitch of enthusiasm .
Deep , dark rumors were in circulation that ' ringers ' would be introduced , but when they lined up at 4 o'clock the nine Republicans were stalwart , grand old party men , while the Democrats were of the pure Jeffersonian strain . "
The Democrats beat their Republican opponents , 26–16 in the first game and continued their winning streak for the first six games .
Republicans won their first game in 1916 .
Due to its growing popularity , the Congressional Baseball Game was first covered via radio in 1928 .
The radio broadcast continued in succeeding years .
The event has at times interrupted the work flow of Congress .
In 1914 , Speaker James Beauchamp " Champ " Clark of Missouri became frustrated with the Congressional Baseball Game interfering with legislative business .
An Appropriations bill on Civil War cotton damage was to be debated on the House floor , but a quorum was not present because of the game .
Despite its appeal , the annual game occurred intermittently because of interruptions due to the Great Depression , the Second World War , and intervention by the House leadership .
For a while the game was held biennially , until the Washington Evening Star newspaper sponsored it annually from 1946 to 1958 .
Despite the sponsorship , Speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas ended the game in 1958 , saying it had become too physically straining on the members and was causing injuries .
With the new sponsor , the Roll Call Trophy was created , for the team that wins each best - of - five series .
It was first awarded in 1965—to the Republican team , which was the first team to win three games since Roll Call had begun its sponsorship .
Since 1965 , a new trophy is awarded to the next team to win three games ( over the next three , four , or five years ) , following the year in which the most recent trophy was awarded .
As of the 2017 game , 14 trophies have been awarded — ten to the Republicans ' team and four to the Democrats ' team .
On June 14 , 2017 , one day before the annual event , a gunman opened fire on Republican members of Congress who were practicing for the next day 's game .
Four people were shot including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise .
The gunman was himself shot by Capitol Police and died at a nearby hospital later that day .
Despite discussions about postponing the game , officials said the game would be held as scheduled .
The shooting resulted in a dramatic increase in interest for the game ; it was reported that revenue from ticket sales and online donations had exceeded $ 1 million , and organizers stated that 24,959 people were in attendance C - SPAN
also announced that it would televise the game .
LOCATIONS Section::::Locations .
The Game was originally played at the American League Park .
However , after the park 's destruction in a fire in March 1911 , it was played at the Griffith Stadium built on the same site in Northwest Washington ,
D.C. In 1962 , it was moved to the new District Stadium ( later renamed Robert F. Kennedy Stadium ) .
It remained there until 1972 , when the Washington Senators moved to Texas becoming the Texas Rangers as RFK did not need a long - term baseball seating layout or field .
It moved for the next two decades to the Memorial Stadium in Baltimore , Maryland , then to Langley High School in McLean , Virginia for 1977 ; and Four Mile Run Park in Alexandria , Virginia .
From 1995 to 2004 , the game was played in Prince George 's Stadium in Bowie , Maryland .
From 2005 to 2007 , the event returned to RFK Stadium when the Montreal Expos moved to Washington to become the Washington Nationals .
In 2008 , Nationals Park was completed and the Nationals moved there along with the Congressional Baseball Game .
In the late 1960s , a post - game reception for members of Congress and their staffs was organized and sponsored by Sears , Roebuck and Company .
However , attendance was very low until 1972 when Sears ' Washington office Public Information officer , Larry Horist took over the management of the event , and established the Most Valuable Player awards to be voted by each team and presented by the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader of the Senate .
He also obtained photos of the players in their hometown uniforms , producing baseball cards packaged in gum wrappers .
A limited number of autographed master sheets of the cards occasionally appear for sale on Internet auction sites .
The cards included such personalities as Senator Eugene McCarthy ( D - MN ) , Barry Goldwater , Jr. ( R - AZ ) , and professional player
" Vinegar Bend " Mizell ( R - NC ) .
The cards were publicized in the Washington Post and became part of the permanent collection of the Baseball Hall of Fame .
ROSTERS
Section::::Rosters .
While the modern Congressional Baseball Game comprises both House and Senate Members , this was not always the case .
From 1909 to 1949 , House Members exclusively filled the rosters — although there appears to have been no prohibition against Senators .
Bicameral baseball was inaugurated in 1950 , when Senator Harry P. Cain of Washington joined the Republican team and Senator - elect George Smathers of Florida , a former Representative , joined the Democratic team .
In a few cases , former professional baseball players were elected to Congress and had a large impact on the game .
In the case of Wilmer " Vinegar Bend " Mizell of North Carolina , a former professional pitcher , the Republican team was victorious for each year that he played .
Fielding a once - a - year team presented some problems for members , who often grew rusty when it came to batting .
Strong pitching proved decisive in most games but , in 1963 , neither team could field a pitcher .
As a result , relief pitcher George Susce of the Washington Senators pitched for both teams .
In 1917 , Representative Jeannette Rankin of Montana tossed out the first pitch and kept score , becoming the first woman to participate in the annual event .
More than 70 years later , in 1993 , Representatives Ileana Ros - Lehtinen of Florida , Maria Cantwell of Washington , and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas became the first women to break into the starting lineup .
In 1971 , the first African Americans joined the game .
Delegate Walter E. Fauntroy of the District of Columbia and Rep. Ron Dellums of California joined the Democratic roster .
Despite Fauntroy 's hitting prowess , the Democrats lost their eighth straight annual game , 7–3 .
In 1909 , Rep. Joseph F. O'Connell of Massachusetts hit the first home run , gaining three runs for the Democrats .
In the same year , Republican Rep. Edward B. Vreeland of New York was the first player to be withdrawn due to an injury .
In 1957 , Rep. Gerald Ford of Michigan hit the first known grand slam , while playing for the Republicans .
In 1979 , Republican Rep. Ron Paul of Texas hit what was believed to be ( at that time )
the first home run hit over the fence .
Rep. John Shimkus of Illinois is the only other player to hit an out - of - the - park home run , doing so in 1997 .
Paul was inducted into the Congressional Baseball Hall of Fame prior to the 2012 game .

In the early years of the game , each team wore a uniform that was either plain or had the words " Republicans " or " Democrats " embroidered on it .
In modern games , members typically have worn uniforms of the professional baseball teams or college baseball teams in their congressional district or home state .
In the 1920s , pomp and fanfare preceded each game .
The United States Navy Band and United States Marine Corps Band traditionally kicked off the festivities with patriotic tunes .
In 1926 , the Republicans paraded into American League Field on a live elephant , while in 1932 both teams had costumed mascots entertain the crowds .
During the 1960s , the teams had cheerleaders dressed in uniforms .
