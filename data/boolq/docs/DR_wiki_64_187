DISEASE THEORY OF ALCOHOLISM
The modern disease theory of alcoholism states that problem drinking is sometimes caused by a disease of the brain , characterized by altered brain structure and function .
The American Medical Association ( AMA ) declared that alcoholism was an illness in 1956 .
In 1991 , the AMA further endorsed the dual classification of alcoholism by the International Classification of Diseases under both psychiatric and medical sections .
THEORY Section::::Theory .
Alcoholism is a chronic problem .
However , if managed properly , damage to the brain can be stopped and to some extent reversed .
In addition to problem drinking , the disease is characterized by symptoms including an impaired control over alcohol , compulsive thoughts about alcohol , and distorted thinking .
Alcoholism can also lead indirectly , through excess consumption , to physical dependence on alcohol , and diseases such as cirrhosis of the liver .
The risk of developing alcoholism depends on many factors , such as environment .
Those with a family history of alcoholism are more likely to develop it themselves ( Enoch & Goldman , 2001 ) ; however , many individuals have developed alcoholism without a family history of the disease .
Since the consumption of alcohol is necessary to develop alcoholism , the availability of and attitudes towards alcohol in an individual 's environment affect their likelihood of developing the disease .
Current evidence indicates that in both men and women , alcoholism is 50–60 % genetically determined , leaving 40 - 50 % for environmental influences .
In a review in 2001 , McLellan et al .
compared the diagnoses , heritability , etiology ( genetic and environmental factors ) , pathophysiology , and response to treatments ( adherence and relapse ) of drug dependence vs type 2 diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and asthma .
They found that genetic heritability , personal choice , and environmental factors are comparably involved in the etiology and course of all of these disorders , providing evidence that drug ( including alcohol ) dependence is a chronic medical illness .
GENETICS AND ENVIRONMENT Section::::Genetics and environment .
According to the theory , genes play a strong role in the development of alcoholism .
Twin studies , adoption studies , and artificial selection studies have shown that a person 's genes can predispose them to developing alcoholism .
Evidence from twin studies show that concordance rates for alcoholism are higher for monozygotic twins than dizygotic twins—76 % for monozygotic twins and 61 % for dizygotic twins .
However , female twin studies demonstrate that females have much lower concordance rates than males .
Reasons for gender differences may be due to environmental factors , such as negative public attitudes towards female drinkers .
Twin studies suggest that males are more likely to have a genetic predisposition for alcoholism .
However , this does not suggest that a male who does have a genetic predisposition will become an alcoholic .
Sometimes the individual may never encounter an environmental trigger that leads to alcoholism .
Adoption studies also suggest a strong genetic tendency towards alcoholism .
Studies on children separated from their biological parents demonstrates that sons of alcoholic biological fathers were more likely to become alcoholic , even though they have been separated and raised by non alcoholic parents .
Female show similar results , but to a lesser degree .
In artificial selection studies , specific strains of rats were bred to prefer alcohol .
These rats preferred drinking alcohol over other liquids , resulting in a tolerance for alcohol and exhibited a physical dependency on alcohol .
Rats that were not bred for this preference did not have these traits .
Upon analyzing the brains of these two strains of rats , it was discovered that there were differences in chemical composition of certain areas of the brain .
This study suggests that certain brain mechanisms are more genetically prone to alcoholism .
The convergent evidence from these studies present a strong case for the genetic basis of alcoholism .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Historians debate who has primacy in arguing that habitual drinking carried the characteristics of a disease .
Some note that Scottish physician Thomas Trotter was the first to characterize excessive drinking as a disease , or medical condition .
Others point to American physician Benjamin Rush ( 1745–1813 ) , a signatory to the United States Declaration of Independence — who understood drunkenness to be what we would now call a " loss of control " — as possibly the first to use the term " addiction " in this sort of meaning .
Rush argued that " habitual drunkenness should be regarded not as a bad habit but as a disease " , describing it as " a palsy of the will " .
Rush expounded his views in a book published in 1808 .
His views are described by Valverde and by Levine :
Swedish physician Magnus Huss coined the term " alcoholism " in his book Alcoholismus chronicus ( 1849 ) .
Some argue he was the first to systematically describe the physical characteristics of habitual drinking and claim that it was a disease .
However , this came decades after Rush and Trotter wrote their works , and some historians argue that the idea that habitual drinking was a diseased state emerged earlier .
Given this controversy , the best one can say is that the idea that habitual alcohol drinking was a disease had become more acceptable by the middle of the nineteenth century , although many writers still argued it was a vice , a sin , and not the purview of medicine but of religion .
Between 1980 and 1991 , medical organizations , including the AMA , worked together to establish policies regarding their positions on the disease theory .
These policies were developed in 1987 in part because third - party reimbursement for treatment was difficult or impossible unless alcoholism were categorized as a disease .
The policies of the AMA , formed through consensus of the federation of state and specialty medical societies within their House of Delegates , state , in part : " The AMA endorses the proposition that drug dependencies , including alcoholism , are diseases and that their treatment is a legitimate part of medical practice . "
In 1991 , the AMA further endorsed the dual classification of alcoholism by the International Classification of Diseases under both psychiatric and medical sections .
CONTROLLED DRINKING
Section::::Controlled drinking .
The disease theory is often interpreted as implying that problem drinkers are incapable of returning to ' normal ' problem free drinking , and therefore that treatment should focus on total abstinence .
Some critics have used evidence of controlled drinking in formerly dependent drinkers to dispute the disease theory of alcoholism .
The first major empirical challenge to this interpretation of the disease theory followed a 1962 study by Dr. D. L. Davies .
Davies ' follow - up of 93 problem drinkers found that 7 of them were able to return to " controlled drinking " ( less than 7 drinks per day for at least 7 years ) .
Davies concluded that " the accepted view that no alcohol addict can ever again drink normally should be modified , although all patients should be advised to aim at total abstinence " ; After the Davies study , several other researchers reported cases of problem drinkers returning to controlled drinking .
In 1976 , a major study commonly referred to as the RAND report , published evidence of problem drinkers learning to consume alcohol in moderation .
The publication of the study renewed controversy over how people suffering a disease which reputedly leads to uncontrollable drinking could manage to drink controllably .
Subsequent studies also reported evidence of return to controlled drinking .
Similarly , according to a 2002 National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ( NIAAA ) study , about one of every six ( 18 % ) of alcohol dependent adults in the U.S. whose dependence began over one year previously had become " low - risk drinkers " ( less than 14 drinks per week and 5 drinks per day for men , or less than 7 per week and 4 per day for women ) .
This modern longitudinal study surveyed more than 43,000 individuals representative of the U.S. adult population , rather than focusing solely on those seeking or receiving treatment for alcohol dependence .
" Twenty years after onset of alcohol dependence , about three - fourths of individuals are in full recovery ; more than half of those who have fully recovered drink at low - risk levels without symptoms of alcohol dependence . " However , many researchers have debated the results of the smaller studies .
A 1994 followup of the original 7 cases studied by Davies suggested that he " had been substantially misled , and the paradox exists that a widely influential paper which did much to stimulate new thinking was based on faulty data .
" The most recent study , a long - term ( 60 year ) follow - up of two groups of alcoholic men by George Vaillant at Harvard Medical School concluded that " return to controlled drinking rarely persisted for much more than a decade without relapse or evolution into abstinence . "
Vaillant also noted that " return - to - controlled drinking , as reported in short - term studies , is often a mirage . "
The second RAND study , in 1980 , found that alcohol dependence represents a factor of central importance in the process of relapse .
Among people with low dependence levels at admission , the risk of relapse appears relatively low for those who later drank without problems .
But the greater the initial level of dependence , the higher the likelihood of relapse for nonproblem drinkers .
The second RAND study findings have been strengthened by subsequent research by Dawson et al .
in 2005 which found that severity was associated positively with the likelihood of abstinent recovery and associated negatively with the likelihood of non - abstinent recovery or controlled drinking .
Other factors such as a significant period of abstinence or changes in life circumstances were also identified as strong influences for success in a book on Controlled Drinking published in 1981 .
MANAGED DRINKING Section::::Managed drinking .
As part of a harm reduction strategy , provision of small amounts of alcoholic beverages to homeless alcoholics at homeless shelters in Toronto and Ottawa reduced government costs and improved health outcomes .
LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS Section::::Legal considerations .
In 1988 , the US Supreme Court upheld a regulation whereby the Veterans ' Administration was able to avoid paying benefits by presuming that primary alcoholism is always the result of the veteran 's " own willful misconduct .
"
The majority opinion written by Justice Byron R. White echoed the District of Columbia Circuit 's finding that there exists " a substantial body of medical literature that even contests the proposition that alcoholism is a disease , much less that it is a disease for which the victim bears no responsibility " .
He also wrote : " Indeed , even among many who consider alcoholism a " disease " to which its victims are genetically predisposed , the consumption of alcohol is not regarded as wholly involuntary . "
However , the majority opinion stated in conclusion that " this litigation does not require the Court to decide whether alcoholism is a disease whose course its victims can not control .
It is not our role to resolve this medical issue on which the authorities remain sharply divided . "
The dissenting opinion noted that " despite much comment in the popular press , these cases are not concerned with whether alcoholism , simplistically , is or is not a " disease . "
"
The American Bar Association " affirms the principle that dependence on alcohol or other drugs is a disease . "
CURRENT ACCEPTANCE Section::::Current acceptance .
Alcoholism is a disease with a known pathology and an established biomolecular signal transduction pathway which culminates in ΔFosB overexpression within the D1-type medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens ; when this overexpression occurs , ΔFosB induces the addictive state .
In 2004 , the World Health Organization published a detailed report on alcohol and other psychoactive substances entitled " Neuroscience of psychoactive substance use and dependence " .
It stated that this was the " first attempt by WHO to provide a comprehensive overview of the biological factors related to substance use and dependence by summarizing the vast amount of knowledge gained in the last 20 - 30 years .
The report highlights the current state of knowledge of the mechanisms of action of different types of psychoactive substances , and explains how the use of these substances can lead to the development of dependence syndrome .
" The report states that " dependence has not previously been recognized as a disorder of the brain , in the same way that psychiatric and mental illnesses were not previously viewed as being a result of a disorder of the brain .
However , with recent advances in neuroscience , it is clear that dependence is as much a disorder of the brain as any other neurological or psychiatric illness . "
The American Society of Addiction Medicine and the American Medical Association both maintain extensive policy regarding alcoholism .
The American Psychiatric Association recognizes the existence of " alcoholism " as the equivalent of alcohol dependence .
The American Hospital Association , the American Public Health Association , the National Association of Social Workers , and the American College of Physicians classify " alcoholism " as a disease .
In the US , the National Institutes of Health has a specific institute , the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ( NIAAA ) , concerned with the support and conduct of biomedical and behavioral research on the causes , consequences , treatment , and prevention of alcoholism and alcohol - related problems .
It funds approximately 90 percent of all such research in the United States .
The official NIAAA position is that " alcoholism is a disease .
The craving that an alcoholic feels for alcohol can be as strong as the need for food or water .
An alcoholic will continue to drink despite serious family , health , or legal problems .
Like many other diseases , alcoholism is chronic , meaning that it lasts a person 's lifetime ; it usually follows a predictable course ; and it has symptoms .
The risk for developing alcoholism is influenced both by a person 's genes and by his or her lifestyle . "
CRITICISM Section::::Criticism .
Some physicians , scientists and others have rejected the disease theory of alcoholism on logical , empirical and other grounds .
Indeed , some addiction experts such as Stanton Peele are outspoken in their rejection of the disease model , and other prominent alcohol researchers such as Nick Heather have authored books intending to disprove the disease model .
Some critics of the disease model argue alcoholism still involves choice , not total loss of control , and stripping alcohol abusers of their choice , by applying the disease concept , is a threat to the health of the individual ; the disease concept gives the substance abuser an excuse .
A disease can not be cured by force of will ; therefore , adding the medical label transfers the responsibility from the abuser to caregivers .
Inevitably the abusers become unwilling victims , and just as inevitably they take on that role .
They argue that the disease theory of alcoholism exists only to benefit the professionals ' and governmental agencies responsible for providing recovery services , and the disease model has not offered a solution for those attempting to stop abusive alcohol and drug use .
These critics hold that by removing some of the stigma and personal responsibility the disease concept actually increases alcoholism and drug abuse and thus the need for treatment .
This is somewhat supported by a study which found that a greater belief in the disease theory of alcoholism and higher commitment to total abstinence to be factors correlated with increased likelihood that an alcoholic would have a full - blown relapse ( substantial continued use ) following an initial lapse ( single use ) .
However , the authors noted that " the direction of causality can not be determined from these data .
It is possible that belief in alcoholism as a loss - of - control disease predisposes clients to relapse , or that repeated relapses reinforce clients ' beliefs in the disease model . "
One study found that only 25 percent of physicians believed that alcoholism is a disease .
The majority believed alcoholism to be a social or psychological problem instead of a disease .
A survey of physicians at an annual conference of the International Doctors in Alcoholics Anonymous reported that 80 percent believe that alcoholism is merely bad behavior instead of a disease .
Thomas R. Hobbs says that " Based on my experiences working in the addiction field for the past 10 years , I believe many , if not most , health care professionals still view alcohol addiction as a willpower or conduct problem and are resistant to look at it as a disease . "
Alcoholics Anonymous says that " Some professionals will tell you that alcoholism is a disease while others contend that it is a choice " and " some doctors will tell you that it is in fact a disease . "
Lynn Appleton says that " Despite all public pronouncements about alcoholism as a disease , medical practice rejects treating it as such .
Not only does alcoholism not follow the model of a ' disease , ' it is not amenable to standard medical treatment . "
She says that " Medical doctors ' rejection of the disease theory of alcoholism has a strong basis in the biomedical model underpinning most of their training " and that " medical research on alcoholism does not support the disease model .
"
" Many doctors have been loath to prescribe drugs to treat alcoholism , sometimes because of the belief that alcoholism is a moral disorder rather than a disease , " according to Dr. Bankole Johnson , Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Virginia .
Dr Johnson 's own pioneering work has made important contributions to the understanding of alcoholism as a disease .
Certain medications including opioid antagonists such as naltrexone have been shown to be effective in the treatment of alcoholism , although research has not yet demonstrated long - term efficacy .
Frequency and quantity of alcohol use are not related to the presence of the condition ; that is , people can drink a great deal without necessarily being alcoholic , and alcoholics may drink minimally or infrequently .
