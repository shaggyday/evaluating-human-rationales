AUSTRALIA Section::::Australia .
The Millennium Drought ( 1997–2009 ) led to a water supply crisis across much of the country .
A combination of increased water usage and lower rainfall / drought in Australia caused state governments to turn to desalination .
As a result , several large - scale desalination plants were constructed ( see list ) .
Large - scale seawater reverse osmosis plants ( SWRO ) now contribute to the domestic water supplies of several major Australian cities including Adelaide , Melbourne , Sydney , Perth and the Gold Coast .
While desalination helped secure water supplies , it is energy intensive ( ≈$140 / ML ) and has a high carbon footprint due to Australia 's coal - based energy supply .
In 2010 , a Seawater Greenhouse went into operation in Port Augusta .
A growing number of smaller scale SWRO plants are used by the oil and gas industry ( both on and offshore ) , by mining companies to supply slurry pipelines for the transport of ore and on offshore islands to supply tourists and residents .

Section::::Texas .
There are a dozen different desalination projects in the state of Texas , both for desalinating groundwater and desalinating seawater from the Gulf of Mexico .
However , currently there are no seawater desalination plants earmarked for municipal purposes .
* El Paso : Brackish groundwater has been treated at the El Paso , Texas , plant since around 2004 .
It produces of fresh water daily ( about 25 % of total freshwater deliveries ) by reverse osmosis .
The plant 's water cost — largely representing the cost of energy — is about 2.1 times higher than ordinary groundwater production .
CALIFORNIA Section::::California .
California has 17 desalination plants in the works , either partially constructed or through exploration and planning phases .
The list of locations includes Bay Point , in the Delta , Redwood City , seven in the Santa Cruz / Monterey Bay , Cambria , Oceaneo , Redondo Beach , Huntington Beach , Dana Point , Camp Pendleton , Oceanside and Carlsbad .
* Carlsbad : The Claude " Bud " Lewis Carlsbad Desalination Plant was constructed at a cost of $ 1 billion by Poseidon Resources and was the largest desalination plant in the United States when it went online December 14 , 2015 .
It produces 50 million gallons a day to 110,000 customers throughout San Diego County .
* Concord : Planned to open in 2020 , producing 20 million gallons a day .
* Monterey County :
Sand City , two miles north of Monterey , with a population of 334 , is the only city in California completely supplied with water from a desalination plant .
* Santa Barbara :
The Charles Meyer Desalination Facility was constructed in Santa Barbara , California , in 1991–92 as a temporary emergency water supply in response to severe drought .
While it has a high operating cost , the facility only needs to operate infrequently , allowing Santa Barbara to use its other supplies more extensively .
The plant was re - activated in the spring of 2017 .
FLORIDA Section::::Florida .
In 1977 , Cape Coral , Florida became the first municipality in the United States to use the RO process on a large scale with an initial operating capacity of 3 million gallons per day .
By 1985 , due to the rapid growth in population of Cape Coral , the city had the largest low pressure reverse osmosis plant in the world , capable of producing 15 MGD .
As of 2012 , South Florida has 33 brackish and two seawater desalination plants operating with seven brackish water plants under construction .
The brackish and seawater desalination plants have the capacity to produce 245 million gallons of potable water per day .
* Tampa Bay : The Tampa Bay Water desalination project near Tampa , Florida , was originally a private venture led by Poseidon Resources , but it was delayed by the bankruptcy of Poseidon Resources ' successive partners in the venture , Stone & Webster , then Covanta ( formerly Ogden ) and its principal subcontractor , Hydranautics .
Stone & Webster declared bankruptcy June 2000 .
Covanta and Hydranautics joined in 2001 , but Covanta failed to complete the construction bonding , and then the Tampa Bay Water agency purchased the project on May 15 , 2002 , underwriting the project .
Tampa Bay Water then contracted with Covanta Tampa Construction , which produced a project that failed performance tests .
After its parent went bankrupt , Covanta also filed for bankruptcy prior to performing renovations that would have satisfied contractual agreements .
This resulted in nearly six months of litigation .
In 2004 , Tampa Bay Water hired a renovation team , American Water / Acciona Aqua , to bring the plant to its original , anticipated design .
The plant was deemed fully operational in 2007 , and is designed to run at a maximum capacity of per day .
The plant can now produce up to per day when needed .
ARIZONA
* Yuma : The desalination plant in Yuma , Arizona , was constructed under authority of the Federal Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act of 1974 to treat saline agricultural return flows from the Wellton - Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District into the Colorado River .
The treated water is intended for inclusion in water deliveries to Mexico , thereby keeping a like amount of freshwater in Lake Mead , Arizona and Nevada .
Construction of the plant was completed in 1992 , and it has operated on two occasions since then .
The plant has been maintained , but largely not operated due to sufficient freshwater supplies from the upper Colorado River .
An agreement was reached in April 2010 between the Southern Nevada Water Authority , the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California , the Central Arizona Project , and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to underwrite the cost of running the plant in a year - long pilot project .
