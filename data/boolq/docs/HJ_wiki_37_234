FIELD MARSHAL ( UNITED KINGDOM )
Field Marshal has been the highest rank in the British Army since 1736 .
A five - star rank with NATO code OF-10 , it is equivalent to an Admiral of the Fleet in the Royal Navy or a Marshal of the Royal Air Force in the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) .
A Field Marshal 's insignia consists of two crossed batons surrounded by yellow leaves below St Edward 's Crown .
Like Marshals of the RAF and Admirals of the Fleet , Field Marshals traditionally remain officers for life , though on half - pay when not in an appointment .
The rank has been used sporadically throughout its history and was vacant during parts of the 18th and 19th centuries ( when all former holders of the rank were deceased ) .
After the Second World War , it became standard practice to appoint the Chief of the Imperial General Staff ( later renamed Chief of the General Staff ) to the rank on his last day in the post .
Army officers occupying the post of Chief of the Defence Staff , the professional head of all the British Armed Forces , were usually promoted to the rank upon their appointment .
In total , 141 men have held the rank of field marshal .
The majority led careers in the British Army or the British Indian Army , rising through the ranks to eventually become a field marshal .
Some members of the British Royal Family — most recently Prince Edward , Duke of Kent , and Charles , Prince of Wales — were promoted to the rank after shorter periods of service .
Three British monarchs — George V , Edward VIII , and George VI — assumed the rank on their accessions to the throne , while Edward VII was already a field marshal , and two British consorts — Albert , Prince Consort and Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh — were appointed by their respective queens .
Other ceremonial appointments were made as diplomatic gestures .
Twelve foreign monarchs held the honour , though three ( Wilhelm II , German Emperor ; Franz Joseph I , Austrian Emperor ; and Hirohito , Emperor of Japan ) were stripped of it when their countries became enemies of Britain and her allies in the two world wars .
Also awarded the rank were one Frenchman ( Ferdinand Foch ) and one Australian ( Sir Thomas Blamey ) , honoured for their contributions to World War I and World War II respectively , and one foreign statesman ( Jan Smuts ) .
A report commissioned by the Ministry of Defence in 1995 made a number of recommendations for financial savings in the armed forces ' budget , one of which was the abolition of the five - star ranks .
Part of the rationale was that these ranks were disproportionate to the size of the forces commanded by these officers and that none of the United Kingdom 's close allies , such as the United States ( which reserves the rank of general of the army for officers who have commanded large armies in major wars ) , used such ranks .
The recommendation was not taken up in full , but the practice of promoting service chiefs to five - star ranks was stopped and the ranks are now reserved for special circumstances .
Sir Peter Inge was , in 1994 , the last active officer to be promoted to the rank .
Inge relinquished the post of Chief of the Defence Staff ( CDS ) in 1997 and his successor , Sir Charles Guthrie , was the first officer not to be promoted upon appointment as CDS .
The most recent promotions to field marshal came in 2012 , eighteen years after the moratorium on routine promotions to the rank , when Queen Elizabeth II promoted Prince Charles , her son and heir apparent , to the five - star ranks in all three services , in recognition of support provided for her in her capacity as Commander - in - Chief of the British Armed Forces .
At the same time , Guthrie , who relinquished the post of CDS and retired from active service in 2001 , was promoted to honorary field marshal .
In June 2014 former Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Walker of Aldringham was also promoted to honorary field marshal .
Although the rank of field marshal is not used in the Royal Marines , the insignia is used on the uniform of the Captain General , the ceremonial head of the corps ( equivalent to colonel - in - chief ) .
INSIGNIA OF RANK Section::::Insignia of rank .
The rank insignia of a field marshal in the British Army comprises two crossed batons in a wreath of oak leaves , with a crown above .
In some other countries , historically under the sphere of British influence , an adapted version of the insignia is used for field marshals , often with the crown being replaced with an alternative cultural or national emblem .
On appointment , British field marshals are awarded a gold - tipped baton which they may carry on formal occasions .
LIST OF FIELD MARSHALS Section::::List of field marshals .
The vast majority of officers to hold the rank of field marshal were professional soldiers in the British Army , though eleven served as officers in the British Indian Army .
At least fifty - seven field marshals were wounded in battle earlier in their careers , of whom 24 were wounded more than once , and eight had been prisoners of war .
Fifteen future field marshals were present at the Battle of Vitoria , where the Duke of Wellington earned the rank , and ten others served under Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo .
However , only thirty - eight held independent commands in the field , and just twelve served as Commander - in - Chief of the Forces ( the pre-1904 professional head of the army ) or Chief of the Imperial General Staff during a major war .
Four field marshals — Sir Evelyn Wood , Sir George White , Earl Roberts , and Lord Gort — had previously received the Victoria Cross ( VC ) , the United Kingdom 's highest and most prestigious award for gallantry " in the face of the enemy " .
Wood , a famously injury - prone officer , was awarded the VC for two actions in 1858 in which he first attacked a group of rebels in India and later rescued an informant from another group of rebels .
White , a cavalry officer , led two charges on enemy guns in Afghanistan in 1879 , while Gort , of the Grenadier Guards , commanded a series of attacks while severely wounded during the First World War in 1918 .
Roberts received his VC for actions during the Indian Mutiny .
Wellington , 44 at the time of his promotion , was the youngest non - royal officer to earn the rank of field marshal .
Charles Moore ,
1st Marquess of Drogheda was the oldest , promoted at the age of 91 , while a further twenty - three officers were promoted to field marshal in their eighties .
Wellington was also the only field marshal to become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , though several others served as cabinet ministers .
No officer whose career was spent in the British Army has ever reached the rank of field marshal without having served in the cavalry , infantry , Royal Armoured Corps , Royal Artillery or Royal Engineers .
Two non - British officers have been appointed field marshals in the British Army — Ferdinand Foch of France and Sir Thomas Blamey of Australia , in recognition of their contributions in the First and Second World Wars respectively — while only one , Sir William RobertsonGeorge Hamilton ,
