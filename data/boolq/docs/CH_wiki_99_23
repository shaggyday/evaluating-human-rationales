MICHELIN GUIDE
Michelin Guides ( ) are a series of guide books published by the French tire company for more than a century .
The term normally refers to the annually published Michelin Red Guide , the oldest European hotel and restaurant reference guide , which awards up to three Michelin stars for excellence to a select few establishments .
The acquisition or loss of a star can have dramatic effects on the success of a restaurant .
Michelin also publishes a series of general guides to cities , regions , and countries , the Green Guides .
HISTORY Section::::History .
In 1900 , there were fewer than 3,000 cars on the roads of France .
To increase the demand for cars and , accordingly , car tires , car tire manufacturers and brothers Édouard and André Michelin published a guide for French motorists in 1900 , the Michelin Guide .
Nearly 35,000 copies of this first , free edition of the guide were distributed ; it provided useful information to motorists , such as maps , tire repair and replacement instructions , car mechanics listings , hotels , and petrol stations throughout France .
Four years later , in 1904 , the brothers published a guide to Belgium similar to the Michelin Guide .
Michelin subsequently introduced guides for Algeria and Tunisia ( 1907 ) ; the Alps and the Rhine ( northern Italy , Switzerland , Bavaria , and the Netherlands ) ( 1908 ) ; Germany , Spain , and Portugal ( 1910 ) ; Ireland and the British Isles ( 1911 ) ; and " The Countries of the Sun " ( ) ( Northern Africa , Southern Italy and Corsica ) ( 1911 ) .
In 1909 , an English - language version of the guide to France was published .
During World War I , publication of the guide was suspended .
After the war , revised editions of the guide continued to be given away until 1920 .
It is said that André Michelin , whilst visiting a tire merchant , noticed copies of the guide being used to prop up a workbench .
Based on the principle that " man only truly respects what he pays for " , Michelin decided to charge a price for the guide , which was about 750 francs or $ 2.15 in 1922 .
They also made several changes , notably listing restaurants by specific categories , adding hotel listings ( initially only for Paris ) , and removing advertisements in the guide .
Recognizing the growing popularity of the restaurant section of the guide , the brothers recruited a team of inspectors to visit and review restaurants , who were always anonymous .
Following the usage of the Murray 's and Baedeker guides , the guide began to award stars for fine dining establishments in 1926 .
Initially , there was only a single star awarded .
Then , in 1931 , the hierarchy of zero , one , two , and three stars was introduced .
Finally , in 1936 , the criteria for the starred rankings were published : * : " A very good restaurant in its category " ( ) * : " Excellent cooking , worth a detour "
( ) * : " Exceptional cuisine , worth a special journey " ( ) .
In 1931 the cover of the guide was changed from blue to red , and has remained so in all subsequent editions .
During World War II , publication was again suspended , but in 1944 , at the request of the Allied Forces , the 1939 guide to France was specially reprinted for military use ; its maps were judged the best and most up - to - date available .
Publication of the annual guide resumed on 16 May 1945 , a week after VE Day .
In the early post - war years the lingering effects of wartime shortages led Michelin to impose an upper limit of two stars ; by 1950 the French edition listed 38 establishments judged to meet this standard .
The first Michelin Guide to Italy was published in 1956 .
It awarded no stars in the first edition .
In 1974 , the first guide to Britain since 1931 was published .
Twenty - five stars were awarded .
In 2005 , Michelin published its first American guide , covering 500 restaurants in the five boroughs of New York City and 50 hotels in Manhattan .
In 2007 , a Tokyo Michelin Guide was launched .
In the same year , the guide introduced a magazine , .
In 2008 , a Hong Kong and Macau volume was added .
As of 2013 , the guide is published in 14 editions covering 23 countries .
In 2008 , the German restaurateur Juliane Caspar was appointed editor - in - chief of the French edition of the guide .
She had previously been responsible for the Michelin guides to Germany , Switzerland , and Austria .
She became the first woman and first non - French national to occupy the French position .
The German newspaper commented on the appointment , " In view of the fact German cuisine is regarded as a lethal weapon in most parts of France , this decision is like Mercedes announcing that its new director of product development is a Martian . "
METHODS AND LAYOUT Section::::Methods and layout .
Red Guides have historically listed many more restaurants than rival guides , relying on an extensive system of symbols to describe each one in as little as two lines .
Reviews of starred restaurants also include two to three culinary specialties .
Short summaries ( 2–3 lines ) were added in 2002/2003 to enhance descriptions of many establishments .
These summaries are written in the language of the country for which the guide is published ( though the Spain and Portugal volume is in Spanish only ) but the symbols are the same throughout all editions .
STARS Section::::Stars .
Michelin reviewers ( commonly called " inspectors " ) are anonymous ; they do not identify themselves , and their meals and expenses are paid for by Michelin , never by a restaurant being reviewed :
The French chef Paul Bocuse , one of the pioneers of in the 1960s , said , " Michelin is the only guide that counts . "
In France , when the guide is published each year , it sparks a media frenzy which has been compared to that for annual Academy Awards for films .
Media and others debate likely winners , speculation is rife , and TV and newspapers discuss which restaurant might lose , and who might gain a Michelin star .
The Michelin Guide also awards Rising Stars , an indication that a restaurant has the potential to qualify for a star , or an additional star .
Since 1955 , the guide has also highlighted restaurants offering " exceptionally good food at moderate prices " , a feature now called " " .
They must offer menu items priced below a maximum determined by local economic standards .
( ) is the company 's nickname for the Michelin Man , its corporate logo for over a century .

OTHER RATINGS
Section::::Other ratings .
All listed restaurants , regardless of their star- or -status , also receive a " fork and spoon " designation , as a subjective reflection of the overall comfort and quality of the restaurant .
Rankings range from one to five :
One fork and spoon represents a " comfortable restaurant " and five signifies a " luxurious restaurant " .
Forks and spoons colored red designate a restaurant that is considered " pleasant " as well .
Restaurants , independently of their other ratings in the guide , can also receive a number of other symbols next to their listing .
* Coins indicate restaurants that serve a menu for a certain price or less , depending on the local monetary standard .
In 2010 France , 2011 US and Japan Red Guides
, the maximum permitted " coin " prices were € 19 , $ 25 , and ¥ 5000 , respectively .
* Interesting view or Magnificent view , designated by a black or red symbol , are given to restaurants offering those features .
* Grapes , a sake set , or a cocktail glass indicate restaurants that offer , at minimum , a " somewhat interesting " selection of wines , sake , or cocktails , respectively .
GREEN GUIDES
Section::::Green Guides .
The Michelin Green Guides review and rate attractions other than restaurants .
There is a Green Guide for France as a whole , and a more detailed one for each of ten regions within France .
Other Green Guides cover many countries , regions , and cities outside France .
Many Green Guides are published in several languages .
They include background information and an alphabetical section describing points of interest .
Like the Red Guides , they use a three - star system for recommending sites ranging from " worth a trip " to " worth a detour " , and " interesting " .
CONTROVERSIES
ALLEGATIONS OF LAX INSPECTION STANDARDS AND BIAS Section::::Controversies .
Section::::Allegations of lax inspection standards and bias .
Pascal Rémy , a veteran France - based Michelin inspector , and also a former Gault Millau employee , wrote a tell - all book published in 2004 entitled L'Inspecteur se met à table ( literally , "
The Inspector Sits Down at the Table " ; idiomatically , " The Inspector Spills the Beans " , or
" The Inspector Lays It All on the Table " ) .
Rémy 's employment was terminated in December 2003 when he informed Michelin of his plans to publish his book .
He brought a court case for unfair dismissal , which was unsuccessful .
Rémy described the French Michelin inspector 's life as lonely , underpaid drudgery , driving around France for weeks on end , dining alone , under intense pressure to file detailed reports on strict deadlines .
He maintained that the guide had become lax in its standards .
Though Michelin states that its inspectors visited all 4,000 reviewed restaurants in France every 18 months , and all starred restaurants several times a year , Rémy said only about one visit
every 3½ years was possible because there were only 11 inspectors in France when he was hired , rather than the 50 or more hinted by Michelin .
That number , he said , had shrunk to five by the time he was fired in December 2003 .
Rémy also accused the guide of favoritism .
He alleged that Michelin treated famous and influential chefs , such as Paul Bocuse and Alain Ducasse , as " untouchable " and not subject to the same rigorous standards as lesser - known chefs .
Michelin denied Rémy 's charges , but refused to say how many inspectors it actually employed in France .
In response to Rémy 's statement that certain three - star chefs were sacrosanct , Michelin said , " There would be little sense in saying a restaurant was worth three stars if it were n't true , if for no other reason than that the customer would write and tell us . "
ALLEGATIONS OF PREJUDICE FOR FRENCH CUISINE Section::::Allegations of prejudice for French cuisine .
Some non - French food critics have alleged that the rating system is biased in favor of French cuisine or French dining standards .
In the UK
The Guardian commented in 1997 that " some people maintain the guide 's principal purpose is as a tool of Gallic cultural imperialism " .
When Michelin published its first New York City Red Guide in 2005 Steven Kurutz of The New York Times noted that Danny Meyer 's Union Square Cafe , a restaurant rated highly by The New York Times , Zagat Survey , and other prominent guides , received a no star - rating from Michelin .
( He did acknowledge that the restaurant received positive mention for its ambiance , and that two other restaurants owned by Meyer received stars ) .
Kurutz also claimed the guide appeared to favor restaurants that " emphasized formality and presentation " rather than a " casual approach to fine dining " .
He also claimed that over half of the restaurants that received one or two stars " could be considered French " .
The Michelin Guide New York 2007 included 526 restaurants , compared to 2,014 in Zagat New York 2007 ; after The Four Seasons Restaurant received no stars in that edition , co - owner Julian Niccolini said Michelin " should stay in France , and they should keep their guide there " .
The 2007 guide does , however , include menus , recipes , and photographs , and description of the atmosphere of starred restaurants .
ALLEGATIONS OF LENIENCY WITH STARS FOR JAPANESE
CUISINE Section::::Allegations of leniency with stars for Japanese cuisine .
In 2010 Michelin guides ranked Japan as the country with the most starred restaurants .
This sparked questioning over whether these high ratings were merited for Japanese restaurants , or whether the Michelin guide was too generous in giving out stars to gain an acceptance with Japanese customers and to enable the parent tire - selling company to market itself in Japan .
The Wall Street Journal reported in 2010 that some Japanese chefs were surprised at receiving a star , and were reluctant to accept one , because the publicity caused an unmanageable jump in booking , affecting their ability to serve their traditional customers without lowering their quality .
UNWANTED STARS Section::::Unwanted stars .
Some restaurateurs have asked Michelin to revoke a star , because they felt that it created undesirable customer expectations or pressure to spend more on service and decor .
Some cases : * ( , Spain ) :
After receiving a star for a perfumed cuisine in 2009 , the restaurant chef Julio Biosca felt the award was granted to dishes that he did not like and restricted his creativity , and tried to remove his star and in December 2013 , discontinued his tasting menu .
The removal took place in the 2015 guide .
* Petersham Nurseries Café ( London ) :
After receiving a star in 2011 , founder and chef Skye Gyngell received complaints from customers expecting formal dining , leading to her attempt to remove the star , and subsequent retirement from the restaurant .
She has now said she regrets her remarks and would welcome a star .
* ' t Huis van Lede ( Belgium ) :
After receiving a star in 2014 , chef Frederick Dhooge said he did not want his Michelin star or his points in the Gault - Millau restaurant guide because some customers were not interested in simple food from a Michelin - starred restaurant .
NOTABLE MISTAKES
*
In 2017 , the Bouche à Oreille café in Bourges was accidentally given a star when it was confused with a restaurant of the same name in Boutervilliers , near Paris .
