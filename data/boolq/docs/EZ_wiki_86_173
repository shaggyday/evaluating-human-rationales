VIRGINITY TEST
A virginity test is the practice and process of determining whether a person , usually a female , is a virgin ; i.e. , to determine that she has never engaged in , or been subjected to , sexual intercourse .
The test typically involves a check for the presence of an intact hymen , on the flawed assumption that it can only be torn as a result of sexual intercourse .
Virginity testing is widely considered controversial , both because of its implications for the tested girls and women and because it is viewed as unethical .
In cases of suspected rape or child sexual abuse , a detailed examination of the hymen may be performed , but the condition of the hymen alone is often inconclusive .
In October 2018 , the UN Human Rights , UN Women and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) stated that virginity testing must end as it is a painful , humiliating and traumatic practice , constituting violence against women .
TWO - FINGER TEST Section::::Two - finger test .
The process of virginity testing varies by region .
In areas where medical doctors are available , the tests would often be given in a doctor 's office .
However , in countries where doctors are not available , testers will often be older women , or whoever can be trusted to search for a hymen .
This is common among African tribes that perform the test .
Another form of virginity testing involves testing for laxity of vaginal muscles with fingers ( the " two - finger test " ) .
A doctor performs the test by inserting a finger into the female 's vagina to check the level of vaginal laxity , which is used to determine if she is " habituated to sexual intercourse " .
However , the usefulness of these criteria has been questioned by medical authorities and opponents of virginity testing because vaginal laxity and the absence of a hymen can both be caused by other factors , and the " two - finger test " is based on subjective observation .
In virginity tests , the presence of a hymen is often used to determine if a woman is a virgin .
Examinations to test for previous sexual activity used to be performed on rape victims in Bangladesh and India before it was banned .
Among the Bantu of South Africa , virginity testing or even the suturing of the labia majora ( called infibulation ) has been commonplace .
Traditionally , Kenuzi girls ( of the Sudan ) are married before puberty by adult men who inspect them manually for virginity .
EXAMPLE OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN Section::::Example of violence against women .
Even though virginity testing has been proclaimed an example of violence against women by the World Health Organization , it is still conducted in many countries .
As virginity testing is a medically unnecessary and invasive genital exam exclusively performed on women and often without their consent , it is thereby grounded in gender and power inequities and undermines women 's decision - making capabilities .
The practice of virginity testing is based on social norms that have been used historically to regulate female sexual activity and justify violence against women .
In societies around the world , especially patriarchal ones , women are often considered property of their fathers or husbands such that their bodies become objects of male control , and their perceived value becomes measured by their ' purity . '
This drives the unequal social pressures for women and girls to remain virgins until they marry .
These attitudes create a framework for men to assume control over female sexual behaviors , and has led to women 's punishment and even death .
It is clear how these discriminatory attitudes have led to violence against women .
Virginity testing perpetuates these harmful stereotyped beliefs through the discriminatory framework that women are primarily responsible for all sexual activity and misconduct .
In Iran , sixteen in - depth , semi - structured interviews were conducted with participants aged 32 to 60 years to elucidate the perceptions and experiences of Iranian examiners of virginity testing .
The perception and experience of examiners were reflected in five main themes .
The result of this study indicated that virginity testing is more than a medical examination , considering the cultural factors involved and its overt and covert consequences .
In Iran , testing is performed for both formal and informal reasons , and examiners view such testing with ambiguity about the accuracy and certainty of the diagnosis and uncertainty about ethics and reproductive rights .
Examiners are affected by the overt and covert consequences of virginity testing , beliefs and cultural values underlying virginity testing , and informal and formal reasons for virginity testing.also used to examine sexual offence .
REASONS Section::::Reasons .
Some cultures require proof of a bride 's virginity prior to her marriage .
This has traditionally been tested by the presence of an intact hymen , which was verified by either a physical examination ( usually by a physician , who would provide a certificate of virginity ) or by a " proof of blood " , which refers to vaginal bleeding that results from the tearing of the hymen .
The physical examination would normally be undertaken before the marriage ceremony , while the " proof by blood " involves an inspection for signs of bleeding as part of the consummation of marriage , after the ceremony .
ABUSE OF WOMEN
Section::::Abuse of women .
Requiring a female to undergo a virginity test is widely seen as harmful , especially when it is performed on behalf of a government .
The practice is seen as sexist , perpetuating the notion that sexual intercourse outside of marriage is acceptable for men , but not for women , and suggesting that a women 's sexual activity should be subject to public knowledge and criticism , while men 's should not .
Egypt military forces performed virginity tests on women detained during the 2011 Egyptian revolution .
After Amnesty International protested to the Egyptian government in March 2011 , the government claimed the tests were carried out in order to refute claims that the women had been raped while in detention .
Amnesty International described the virginity tests as " nothing less than torture " .
Virginity tests done by the military on detainees were banned in Egypt on 27 December 2011 , but in March 2012 , the physician who carried out the tests was acquitted of all charges .
Samira Ibrahim is the Egyptian woman who filed suit against the government , initiating public discussion of the Egyptian government 's use of the testing .
She said in response to the physician 's acquittal , " A woman 's body should not be used as a tool for intimidation , and nobody should have their dignity violated . "
Many spouses tend to engage in virginity tests based on the fact the hymen did not bleed after the first intercourse , leading to countless social problems in many middle - eastern countries .
Virginity testing was also used on women entering the United Kingdom on a so - called fiancée visa , when they said they were immigrating to marry their fiancées who were already living in the country .
The British government argued that if the women were virgins , they were more likely to be telling the truth about their reason for immigrating to the country .
In January 1979 , a woman was required by British immigration officers to undergo a virginity test when she arrived in London claiming that she was there to marry .
Such a visit did not require a visa , but as proof of her bona fides , she was required to submit to the test .
This practice was exposed by The Guardian in 1979 and the policy was quickly changed .
In August 2013 , it was announced in Prabumulih district , South Sumatra , Indonesia , by education chief Muhammad Rasyid that female teens attending high school there would be given mandatory annual virginity tests , beginning in 2014 .
The stated intent is to reduce promiscuity in the district .
In 2014 the Human Rights Watch reported that a physical virginity test is routinely performed on female candidates to the Indonesian Police force as part of the job application process .
In Iran , Atena Farghadani was charged with " illicit sexual relations falling short of adultery " for shaking hands with her lawyer in June 2015 .
She complained that Iranian prison officials and guards have made lewd gestures , sexual slurs and other insults to her , and went on a three - day " dry " hunger strike in September 2015 in protest of this ill - treatment .
However , the harassment continued .
In a note written by Farghadani leaked from prison , which has been seen by Amnesty International , Farghadani says the judicial authorities took her to a medical center outside the prison on August 12 , 2015 and forced her to submit to a virginity test , purportedly for the purpose of investigating the charge against her .
Virginity tests are common in Afghanistan .
Some women undergo multiple tests .
The tests are often done without the woman 's consent .
They have drawn widespread condemnation , with critics saying they are inhumane and hurt the dignity of women .
RELIABILITY Section::::Reliability .
Many researchers state that a broken hymen is not a reliable indicator that a female has been vaginally penetrated because the tearing of the hymen may have been the result of some other event .
Furthermore , in rare cases , some girls are born without hymens .
The hymen is a ring of fleshy tissue that sits just inside the vaginal opening .
Normal variations range from thin and stretchy to thick and somewhat rigid .
The only variation that may require medical intervention is the imperforate hymen , which either completely prevents the passage of menstrual fluid or slows it significantly .
In either case , surgical intervention may be needed to allow menstrual fluid to pass or intercourse to take place at all .
It is a misconception that the hymen always tears during first intercourse or that intercourse is required to rupture the hymen .
A female can undergo a surgical procedure , called hymenorrhaphy or hymenoplasty , to repair or replace a torn hymen , to pass a virginity test .
CRITICISM Section::::Criticism .
In May 2013 , the Supreme Court of India held that the two - finger test on a rape victim violates her right to privacy , and asked the Delhi government to provide better medical procedures to confirm sexual assault .
In 2003 , the Supreme Court of India called TFT " hypothetical " and " opinionative " .
Most countries have scrapped it as archaic , unscientific and invasive of privacy and dignity .
Quebec 's Collège des Médecins has banned members from conducting virginity tests after some were found to be doing this , as well as providing virginity certificates .
REASONS FOR TESTING PREVENTION OF DISEASE AND PREGNANCY Section::::Reasons for testing .
Section::::Prevention of disease and pregnancy .
Preventing the spread of HIV and teenage pregnancy are examples of reasons given by proponents of virginity testing .
In 2004 , a Zimbabwean village chief , Naboth Makoni , stated that he would adopt a plan to enforce virginity tests as a way of protecting his people against HIV .
He explained that he focuses on girls because he believes they are easier to control than boys .
In South Africa , where virginity testing is banned , the Zulu tribe believes that the practice prevents the spread of HIV and teenage pregnancy .
A woman interviewed by the Washington Post stated that " [ Virginity testing ] is important so that young girls become scared of boys .
Because what happens is first the boy strips you of your virginity , and the next thing you know is you are pregnant and you have HIV . " ROYAL AFFIRMATIONS Section::::Royal affirmations .
In Zulu culture , there is a tradition in which girls of a certain age can perform a dance for the king .
However , only virgins are allowed to participate .
If a girl is tested and declared a virgin , she brings honor to her family .
If a girl is found not to be a virgin , her father may have to pay a fine for ' tainting ' the community and the girl may be shunned from the ' certified ' virgins .
Because of the ramifications that being considered impure have for the girls and their families , virginity testing has the potential to be a life - changing event .
In UK royal family it was a rule that only virgins can become bride of the royal family , however this was later removed in the 21st century .
