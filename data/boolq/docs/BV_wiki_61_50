TEACHING ASSISTANT
A teaching assistant or teacher 's aide ( TA ) or education assistant ( EA ) is an individual who assists a teacher with instructional responsibilities .
TAs include : graduate teaching assistants ( GTAs ) , who are graduate students ; undergraduate teaching assistants ( UTAs ) , who are undergraduate students ; secondary school TAs , who are either high school students or adults ; and elementary school TAs , who are adults ( also known as paraprofessional educators or teacher 's aides ) .
By definition , TAs assist with classes , but many graduate students serve as the sole instructor for one or more classes each semester as a teaching fellow or graduate student instructor .
Graduate and adult TAs generally have a fixed salary determined by each contract period ( usually a semester or an academic year ) ; however , undergraduates and high school students are sometimes unpaid and , in the US and other countries with the credit system , receive course credits in return for their assistance .
Teaching assistants often help the main teacher by managing students with learning disabilities , such as ADHD , Autism , or even physical disabilities , such as blindness or deafness .
GRADUATE
Section::::Graduate .
Graduate teaching assistants ( often referred to as GTAs or simply TAs ) are graduate students employed on a temporary contract by a department at a college or university in teaching - related responsibilities .
In New Zealand , Australian , and some Canadian universities , graduate TAs are known as tutors .
North American graduate TA positions provide funding for postgraduate research — although the main purpose is to provide teaching support — and it often serves as a first career step for aspiring academics .
TA responsibilities vary greatly and may include : tutoring ; holding office hours ; invigilating tests or exams ; and assisting a professor with a large lecture class by teaching students in recitation , laboratory , or discussion sessions .
Professors may also use their teaching assistants to help teach discussions during regular class .
This gives the graduate student opportunity to use their teaching skills , as many are in pursuit of teaching careers .
Some graduate students assist in distance education courses by meeting with the students as professors are not able to .
Graduate TAs should not be confused with teaching fellows ( TFs ) or graduate student instructors ( GSIs ) , who are graduate students who serve as the primary instructors for courses .
However , at some universities the TF and TA titles are used interchangeably .
TUTORIALS Section::::Tutorials .
In British , Australian , New Zealand , South African , Italian , Irish and some Canadian universities , a tutor is often , but not always , a postgraduate student or a lecturer assigned to conduct a seminar for undergraduate students , often known as a tutorial .
The equivalent of this kind of tutor in the United States and the rest of Canada is known as a graduate teaching assistant or a graduate student instructor ( GSI ) .
UNDERGRADUATE Section::::Undergraduate .
UTAs or JTAs ( Junior Teacher Assistants ) usually serve as true assistants to a class ; they typically have taken the course with which they are assisting , often with the same professor , and have performed well in it .
This case is less common for GTAs , since many would have been undergraduates at other institutions .
Unlike professors and GTAs , UTAs generally do not have a fixed salary but instead are paid by the hour , earn credit hours , or volunteer their time .
HIGH SCHOOL Section::::High school .
The term teaching assistant is used in the high school and middle school setting for students or adults that assist a teacher with one or more classes .
The responsibilities , situations , and conditions of these individuals ' involvement differ from those in higher education .
A less formal position , a TA job in secondary education is generally determined by the supervising teacher .
Common tasks include assisting students with their work , and taking attendance .
Most of the responsibilities of Teaching Assistants do not require the academic expertise of the professor in charge .
Some teaching assistants at this level may teach portions of the class lessons , or teach lessons to small groups of students who need extra instruction .
Many TAs work " one - on - one " with special needs students ; these TAs shadow their student and assist with classwork , organization , and behavior management .
In some parts of the United States it is customary or even required that each classroom have one certified teacher and one or more co - teachers or teaching assistants .
Students attending high school and middle schools can take a course , usually an elective , and perform tasks such as grade and record scores on homework or tests .
The teacher in this setting reviews the grading to assign partial credit on tests and uses discretion .
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL Section::::Elementary school .
An elementary school teaching assistant is an adult who is hired to help a teacher with class - related duties , which are similar to those encountered in middle and high school settings .
They are sometimes referred to as paraprofessionals ( ' paras ' for short ) or teacher 's aides .
Elementary school teaching assistants are generally hired on a contract that lasts the entire academic year .
Teaching assistants aide with multiple duties within schools , and can be hired in special education as well .
