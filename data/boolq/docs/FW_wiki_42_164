LIST OF LARGE COUNCIL ESTATES IN THE UK
This list of large council estates in the United Kingdom includes estates generally considered to have a population in excess of 10,000 ( although population figures are not compiled for many estates , as they do not usually correspond to local government units ) .
Becontree in Dagenham is generally considered to be the largest council estate ( in terms of population ) , with Wythenshawe in Manchester the second largest .
Gipton in Leeds is a contender for third largest .
Some of the most infamous council estates , such as Heygate Estate ( setting of the movie Harry Brown ) in London , or Hulme Crescents ( once Europe 's largest public housing development ) in Manchester , have since been demolished .
