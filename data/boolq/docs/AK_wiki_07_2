THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY
The Partridge Family is an American musical sitcom starring Shirley Jones and featuring David Cassidy .
Jones played a widowed mother , and Cassidy played the oldest of her five children who embarked on a music career .
It ran from September 25 , 1970 , until March 23 , 1974 , on the ABC network as part of a Friday - night lineup , and had subsequent runs in syndication .
The family was loosely based on the real - life musical family The Cowsills , a popular band in the late 1960s and early 1970s .
PREMISE Section::::Premise .
In the pilot episode , a group of musical siblings in the fictitious city of San Pueblo , California ( said to be " 40 miles from Napa County " in episode 24 , " A Partridge By Any Other Name " ) convinces their widowed mother , bank teller Shirley Partridge , to help them out by singing as they record a pop song in their garage .
Through the efforts of precocious 10-year - old Danny they find a manager , Reuben Kincaid , who helps make the song a Top 40 hit .
After more persuading , Shirley agrees that the family can go on tour .
They acquire an old school bus , a 1957 Chevrolet Series 6800 Superior , for touring , paint it with Mondrian - inspired patterns , and head to Las Vegas , Nevada for their first live gig at Caesars Palace .
Subsequent episodes usually feature the band performing in various venues or in their garage .
The shows often contrast suburban life with the adventures of a show - business family on the road .
After the first season , more of the show 's action takes place in their hometown than on tour .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The Partridge Family was created for television by Bernard Slade ; the series ' executive producer was Bob Claver .
The show was inspired by and loosely based on The Cowsills , a family pop music group that was famous in the late 1960s .
In the show 's early development , the Cowsill children were considered by the producers , but because the Cowsills were not trained actors and were too old for the roles as scripted , Slade and Claver abandoned that idea .
Shirley Jones had already been signed as mother Shirley Partridge and star of the show .
The pilot was filmed in December 1969 .
This unaired pilot differs from the pilot broadcast in 1970 .
In the unaired pilot , Shirley 's name is " Connie " and she has a boyfriend played by Jones ' real - life husband at the time , Jack Cassidy , father of David Cassidy .
Laurie mentions her late father once getting drunk at a Christmas party , and the family has a different address and live in Ohio .
The show proved popular , but the fame took its toll on several , if not most , of the starring cast , particularly David Cassidy .
In the midst of his rise to fame , Cassidy soon felt stifled by the show and trapped by the mass hysteria surrounding his every move .
In May 1972 , he appeared nude on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine in a cropped Annie Leibovitz photo .
He used the article to get away from his squeaky clean image .
Among other things , the article mentions Cassidy was riding around New York in the back of a car " stoned and drunk . "
Shortly after the series ended , scriptwriter Roberta Tatum launched a lawsuit against Screen Gems concerning the creation of the show .
Tatum claimed that she had submitted a similar premise to Screen Gems prior to 1970 called Baker 's Half - Dozen .
The matter was resolved out of court , with Tatum receiving a reported $ 150,000 from Screen Gems .

EPISODES
PRODUCTION Section::::Production .
At the end of the first season , Jeremy Gelbwaks ' family moved out of the Los Angeles area , and the part of Chris was recast with actor Brian Forster .
According to David Cassidy , Gelbwaks " had a personality conflict with every person in the cast and the producers " and especially did not get along with Cassidy or Bonaduce .
A dog named Simone was featured in the first season , but it was phased out during the second season .
At the beginning of the fourth season , a four - year - old neighbor , Ricky Stevens ( Ricky Segall ) , was featured and would sing a children 's song during each episode , but the character was dropped mid - season .

Music recorded for the pilot episode was produced by Monkees ' producer Shorty Rogers .

Actor David Cassidy was originally to lip sync with the rest of the cast , but convinced Farrell that he could sing and was allowed to join the studio ensemble as the lead singer .
He and his step - mother , Shirley , are the only two show actors allowed to sing for recording .
The Partridge Family theme song , produced by Rogers , was shown over opening credits .
More than one song was used as the theme song .

" Five of us , and Mom working all day , we knew we could help her if our music would pay , Danny got Reuben to sell our song , and it really came together when Mom sang along ... "
( from " When We 're Singin ' " )
Later , under Farrell 's direction , the new version had new lyrics sung to the " When We 're Singin ' " tune .
With the new chorus finalized , " C'mon Get Happy " showcased the new verse :
" We had a dream , we 'd go travelin ' together ,
We 'd spread a little lovin'
then we 'd keep movin ' on .
Somethin' always happens whenever we 're together
We get a happy feelin ' when we 're singing a song ...

MEDIA DISCOGRAPHY Section::::Media .
Section::::Discography .
The Partridge Family was produced for ABC by Screen Gems .
The company promoted the show by releasing a series of albums featuring the family band , though David Cassidy and Shirley Jones , who sang background , were the only cast members who were actually featured on the recordings .
As the show and other associated merchandising soared , David Cassidy became a teen idol .
The producers signed Cassidy as a solo act as well .
Cassidy began touring with his own group of musicians , performing Partridge songs as well as hits from his own albums , to thousands of screaming teenagers in major stadiums across the USA , UK , Europe , Japan and Australia .
The Partridge Family 's biggest hit came in 1970 with the song "
I Think I Love You " , written by Tony Romeo ( who had previously written several of the Cowsills ' hits ) , peaked at Number 1 on the Billboard charts in December of that year .
It sold over five million copies , outselling the Beatles ' "
Let It Be " , was awarded a gold disc , and made the group the third fictional artist to have a No . 1 hit ( after The Chipmunks and The Archies ) .
The song 's companion LP , The Partridge Family Album , reached Number 4 in the Billboard 200 .
It was also awarded a gold disc by the RIAA in December 1970 , having sold over 500,000 copies .
A string of hit Partridge singles followed : " Does n't Somebody Want to Be Wanted " , " I 'll Meet You Halfway " , " I Woke Up In Love This Morning " , " It 's One of Those Nights ( Yes Love ) " , " Am I Losing You " , " Looking Through the Eyes of Love " , " Breaking Up Is Hard to Do " , and " A Friend and a Lover " .
These singles were showcased on million - selling albums including Up To Date , Sound Magazine , Shopping Bag , Notebook , Crossword Puzzle , and Bulletin Board .
Their holiday album A Partridge Family Christmas Card was the No . 1 selling Christmas record of 1971 .
Record sales success was replicated internationally , with both The Partridge Family ( group ) and David Cassidy ( solo ) achieving huge hits in Canada , Great Britain , Europe , Japan , Australia , New Zealand and South Africa .
In all , The Partridge Family released 89 songs on 9 albums between 1970 and 1973 .
DANNY BONADUCE ALBUM Section::::Danny Bonaduce album .
Though Danny Bonaduce was not part of the session band , he also got a recording contract , and released a self - titled album in 1972 , Danny Bonaduce .
Though Bonaduce was credited as lead singer on all songs , he insists that he had a weak voice and that Bruce Roberts provided most of the vocals on the album .
The first track , " I 'll Be Your Magician " , in which the 13-year - old Bonaduce seduces a woman into having sexual intercourse with him , has developed a cult following for its campy entertainment value .
The original , watered - down , version was recorded with Cassidy for the Sound Magazine album , but was discarded and never released .
In fall 2010 , Cassidy dared Bonaduce to learn how to play the bass guitar lines on the songs the Partridge Family performed .
Bonaduce learned the bass guitar line for " Does n't Somebody Want to Be Wanted " , stating that although he had no ability to read music , the song was relatively easy to learn ; Cassidy and Bonaduce subsequently performed together on rare occasions .
RICKY SEGALL
ALBUM
