From 1974 to 1997 the Capitals played their home games at the Capital Centre , in Landover , Maryland ( a suburb of Washington , D.C. ) .
In 1997 the team moved to the arena now called Capital One Arena , their present home arena in Washington ,
D.C. The Capitals were founded in as an expansion franchise , alongside the Kansas City Scouts .
Since purchasing the team in 1999 , Leonsis revitalized the franchise by drafting star players such as Alexander Ovechkin , Nicklas Backstrom , Mike Green and Braden Holtby .
The 2009–10 Capitals won the franchise 's first Presidents ' Trophy for being the team with the most points at the end of the regular season .
They won it a second time in 2015–16 , and did so for a third time the following season in 2016–17 .

The Capitals have retired the use of four numbers in honor of four players .
In addition , the team holds an association with a number of individuals inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame .
The Capitals are presently affiliated with two minor league teams , the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League , and the South Carolina Stingrays of the ECHL .
HISTORY EARLY YEARS ( 1974–1982 )
Section::::History .
Section::::Early years ( 1974–1982 ) .
Along with the Kansas City Scouts , the Capitals joined the NHL as an expansion team for the 1974–75 season ( although the city of Washington was awarded a franchise on July 8 , 1972 ) .
The team was owned by Abe Pollin ( also owner of the National Basketball Association 's Washington Bullets / Wizards until his death on November 24 , 2009 ) .
Pollin had built the Capital Centre in suburban Landover , Maryland , to house both the Bullets ( who formerly played in Baltimore ) and the Capitals .
His first act as owner was to hire Hall of Famer Milt Schmidt as general manager .
With a combined 30 teams between the NHL and the World Hockey Association ( WHA ) , the available talent was stretched thin .
The Capitals had few players with professional experience and were at a disadvantage against the long - standing teams that were stocked with veteran players .
Like the other three teams who joined the league during the WHA era — the Scouts ( later the Colorado Rockies and now the New Jersey Devils ) , Atlanta Flames ( now playing in Calgary ) , and New York Islanders — the Capitals did not factor the survival of the rival league into their plans .
The Capitals ' inaugural season was dreadful , even by expansion standards .
They finished with far and away the worst record in the league at 8–67–5 .
Their 21 points were half that of their expansion brethren , the Scouts .
The eight wins are the fewest for an NHL team playing at least 70 games , and the .131 winning percentage is still the worst in NHL history .
They also set records for most road losses ( 39 out of 40 ) , most consecutive road losses ( 37 ) , and most consecutive losses ( 17 ) .
Head coach Jim Anderson said , " I 'd rather find out my wife was cheating on me than keep losing like this .
At least I could tell my wife to cut it out . "
Schmidt himself had to take over the coaching reins late in the season .
In 1975–76 , Washington went 25-straight games without a win and allowed 394 goals en route to another horrendous record :
11–59–10 ( 32 points ) .
During the middle of the season , Max McNab was hired as the team 's general manager , and Tom McVie was hired as head coach to replace Schmidt .
For the rest of the 1970s and early 1980s , the Capitals alternated between dreadful seasons and finishing only a few points out of the Stanley Cup playoffs .
In 1980 and 1981 , for instance , they were in playoff contention until the last day of the season .
The one bright spot during these years of futility was that many of McNab 's draft picks ( e.g. Rick Green , Ryan Walter , Mike Gartner , Bengt Gustafsson , Gaetan Duchesne and Bobby Carpenter ) would impact the team for years to come , whether as important members of the roster or crucial pieces to major trades .
Pollin stuck it out through the Capitals ' first decade , even though they were usually barely competitive .
This stood in contrast to the Capitals ' expansion brethren , the Scouts ; they were forced to move to Denver after only two years because their original owners did not have the resources or patience to withstand the struggles of an expansion team .
By the summer of 1982 , however , there was serious talk of the team moving out of the U.S. capital , and a " Save the Caps " campaign was underway .
Then two significant events took place to revive the franchise .
PLAYOFFS AND EASTERN CONFERENCE CHAMPION ( 1982–1998 )
Section::::Playoffs and Eastern Conference champion ( 1982–1998 ) .
First , the team hired David Poile as general manager .
Second , as his first move , Poile pulled off one of the largest trades in franchise history on September 9 , 1982 , when he dealt longtime regulars
Ryan Walter and Rick Green to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for Rod Langway ( named captain only a few weeks later ) , Brian Engblom , Doug Jarvis and Craig Laughlin .
This move turned the franchise around , as Langway 's solid defense helped the team to dramatically reduce its goals - against , and the explosive goal - scoring of Dennis Maruk , Mike Gartner and Bobby Carpenter fueled the offensive attack .
Another significant move was the drafting of defenseman Scott Stevens during the 1982 NHL Entry Draft ( the pick was made by interim general manager Roger Crozier , prior to Poile 's hiring ) .
The result was a 29-point jump , a third - place finish in the powerful Patrick Division , and the team 's first playoff appearance in 1983 .
Although they were eliminated by the three - time - defending ( and eventual )
Stanley Cup champion New York Islanders ( three games to one ) , the Caps ' dramatic turnaround ended any talk of the club leaving Washington .
FOURTEEN - CONSECUTIVE
PLAYOFF APPEARANCES ( 1983–96 ) Section::::Fourteen - consecutive playoff appearances ( 1983–96 ) .
The Capitals would make the playoffs for each of the next 14 years in a row .
They became known for starting slow before catching fire in January and February .
However , regular - season success did not carry into the playoffs .
Despite a continuous march of stars like Gartner , Carpenter , Langway , Gustafsson , Mike Ridley , Dave Christian , Dino Ciccarelli , Larry Murphy and Kevin Hatcher , Washington was knocked out in either the first or second round eight years in a row .
In 1985–86 , for instance , the Caps finished with 107 points and won 50 games for the first time in franchise history , good enough for the third - best record in the NHL .
They defeated the Islanders in the first round but were eliminated in the second round by the New York Rangers .
The 1986–87 season brought even more heartbreak , with a loss to the Islanders in the Patrick Division Semi - final .
This series was capped off by the classic Easter Epic game , which ended at 1:56 am on Easter Sunday 1987 .
The Capitals had thoroughly dominated most of the game , outshooting the Islanders 75–52 , but lost in overtime when goaltender Bob Mason was beaten on a Pat LaFontaine shot from the blue line .
For the 1989 playoff push , Gartner and defenseman Larry Murphy were traded to the Minnesota North Stars in exchange for Ciccarelli and defenseman Bob Rouse , however the goaltending once again faltered and they were eliminated in the first round by the Philadelphia Flyers .
The Capitals finally made the Wales Conference Finals in 1990 , but went down in a four - game sweep at the hands of the first - place Boston Bruins .
RETURN TO PLAYOFFS AND
FIRST STANLEY CUP FINALS APPEARANCE
( 1996–98 ) Section::::Return to playoffs and first Stanley Cup Finals appearance ( 1996–98 ) .
From 1991 to 1996 , the Capitals would lose in either the first or the second round of the playoffs .
They would eliminate the Rangers in the first round but lost the second round to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1991 .
In 1992 and 1993 , they would lose in the first round to the Penguins and the Islanders , respectively .
In 1994 , they won their first round series against the Penguins but lost in the second round to the Rangers .
In 1995 and 1996 , they lost in the first round both times to the Penguins .
They would miss the playoffs in 1997 , but they came the close to winning their first Stanley Cup one year later .
Then in 1998 , as the Caps opened MCI Center , Peter Bondra 's 52 goals led the team , veterans Dale Hunter , Joe Juneau and Adam Oates returned to old form , and Olaf Kolzig had a solid .920 save percentage as the Caps got past the Boston Bruins , Ottawa Senators and Buffalo Sabres ( the latter on a dramatic overtime win in game six on a goal by Joe Juneau )
en route to the team 's first Stanley Cup finals appearance .
The Capitals won six overtime games , three in each of their series against the Bruins and Sabres .
However , the team was outmatched by the defending champions , the Detroit Red Wings , who won in a four - game sweep .
That same season , Oates , Phil Housley and Hunter all scored their 1,000th career point , the only time in NHL history that one team had three players reach that same milestone in a single season .
DISAPPOINTMENTS AND REBUILDING ( 1998–2004 )
Section::::Disappointments and rebuilding ( 1998–2004 ) .
After their 1998 championship run , the Capitals finished the 1998–99 season with a record of 31 - 45 - 6 and failed to qualify for the playoffs .
During the season , the team was sold to a group headed by AOL executive Ted Leonsis .
The Capitals went on to win back - to - back Southeast Division titles in 2000 and 2001 , yet both years lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Penguins .
After the 2000–01 season , Adam Oates demanded a trade but management refused and stripped him of his team captaincy .
In the summer of 2001 , the Capitals landed five - time Art Ross Trophy winner Jaromir Jagr , by trading three young prospects to the Pittsburgh Penguins .
Jagr was signed to the largest contract ever in NHL history – $ 77 million over seven years at an average salary of $ 11 million per year ( over $ 134,000 per game ) , with an option for an eighth year .
However , after Adam Oates was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers , the Capitals failed to defend their division title and missed the playoffs in 2002 despite a winning record .
Still , the 2001–02 season marked the highest attendance in franchise history , drawing in 710,990 fans and 17,341 per game .
Before the 2002–03 season , the Caps made more roster changes , including the signing of highly regarded Robert Lang as a free agent , a linemate of Jagr 's from Pittsburgh .
Washington returned to the playoffs in 2003 , but disappointed fans again by losing in six games to the Tampa Bay Lightning after starting off with a two - game lead in the best - of - seven first - round series .
The series is well - remembered for the three - overtime Game 6 at the then – MCI Center .
At the time it was the longest game in the building 's history and was eventually decided by a power - play goal by Tampa Bay .
In the 2003–04 season , the Caps unloaded much of their high - priced talent – not just a cost - cutting spree , but also an acknowledgment that their attempt to build a contender with high - priced veteran talent had failed .
Jagr had never lived up to expectations during his time with the Capitals , failing to finish among the league 's top scorers or make the post - season All - Star Team .
The Caps tried to trade Jagr , but as only one year was left on the existing NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement ( CBA ) before it expired , few teams were willing to risk $ 11 million on an underperforming player .
In 2004 , Jagr was finally sent to the New York Rangers in exchange for Anson Carter and an agreement that Washington would pay approximately $ 4 million per year of Jagr 's salary , with Jagr himself agreeing to defer ( with interest ) $ 1 million per year for the remainder of his contract to allow the trade to go ahead .
This was quickly followed by Peter Bondra departing for the Ottawa Senators .
Not long after , Robert Lang was sent to the Detroit Red Wings , as well as Sergei Gonchar to the Boston Bruins .
The Lang trade marked the first time in the history of the NHL that the league 's leading scorer was traded in the middle of the season .
The Capitals ended the year 23–46–10–3 , tied for the second - worst record , along with the Chicago Blackhawks .
ALEXANDER OVECHKIN ERA ( 2004–PRESENT )
Section::::Alexander Ovechkin era ( 2004–present ) .
In the 2004 NHL Entry Draft , the Capitals won the Draft Lottery , moving ahead of the Pittsburgh Penguins , who held the NHL 's worst record , and selected Alexander Ovechkin first overall .
During the NHL labor dispute of 2004–05 , which cost the NHL its entire season , Ovechkin stayed in Russia , playing for Dynamo Moscow .
Several other Capitals played part or all of the lost season in Europe , including Olaf Kolzig , Brendan Witt , Jeff Halpern , and Alexander Semin .
The Capitals ' 2005 off - season consisted of making D.C.-area native Halpern the team 's captain , signing Andrew Cassels , Ben Clymer , Mathieu Biron and Jamie Heward , and acquiring Chris Clark and Jeff Friesen via trade .
BUILDING
A CONTENDER
( 2005–08 ) Section::::Building a contender ( 2005–08 ) .
The Capitals finished the 2005–06 season in the cellar of the Southeastern Division again , with a 29–41–12 campaign , earning 12 more points than the 2003–04 season , good for 27th out of the 30 NHL teams .
The team , however , played close in every game , playing in 42 one - goal games , although losing two - thirds of those games .
Ovechkin 's rookie season exceeded the hype , as he led all 2005–06 NHL rookies in goals , points , power - play goals and shots .
He finished third overall in the NHL in scoring and tied for third in goals , and his 425 shots not only led the league , but also set an NHL rookie record and was the fourth - highest total in NHL history .
Ovechkin 's rookie point total was the second - best in Capitals history , and his goal total was tied for third in franchise history .
Ovechkin won the Calder Memorial Trophy , beating out Pittsburgh center Sidney Crosby and Calgary Flames defenseman Dion Phaneuf .
Many longtime Capitals had career years , with Dainius Zubrus netting 57 points , Halpern having a career - best 33 assists , Matt Pettinger putting in a career - best 20-goal , 38-point effort and seven others on the relatively young team topping 20 points for the first time .
Two notable landmarks were also hit by Capitals , as the team 's longest tenured player , Olaf Kolzig , won his 250th game in goal , and Andrew Cassels became the 204th player to play 1,000 games , although he did not finish his season with Washington .
A notable first was that Washington area native Jeff Halpern was named captain of his hometown Capitals .
At the 2006 NHL trade deadline , on March 8 , Brendan Witt was traded to the Nashville Predators .
In the 2006 off - season , Halpern left the Capitals to join the Dallas Stars ; Chris Clark subsequently became the Capitals ' new captain .
Richard Zedník returned to the Capitals in 2006–07 after a disappointing 16-goal , 14-assist season in 2005–06 with the Montreal Canadiens , but was later dealt at the trade deadline to the New York Islanders after a disappointing and injury plagued season .
The Caps also signed former Philadelphia Flyers enforcer Donald Brashear .
Despite the transactions , however , the Capitals finished with the same point total ( 70 ) in 2006–2007 as they did the year before , although they won one fewer game .
Alexander Ovechkin was the Capitals ' lone representative in the season 's All - Star Game , with Washington 's campaign also seeing the breakout of Alexander Semin , who notched 38 goals in only his second NHL season .
The Capitals signed Swedish phenom Nicklas Backstrom , the fourth overall pick in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft , to a three - year entry - level contract .
They also signed 19-year - old Semyon Varlamov to a three - year entry - level contract .
They then went on to fill needs at defense , signing puck - moving defenseman Tom Poti ; right wing , by signing Viktor Kozlov ; and center , by signing playmaker Michael Nylander .
As a result of these signings , there was much more hope for the 2007–08 season and players were looking towards the playoffs .
After starting the season 6–14–1 , the Capitals fired head coach Glen Hanlon and replaced him with Hershey Bears head coach Bruce Boudreau on Thanksgiving Day , 2007 .
On January 10 , 2008 , the Capitals signed Ovechkin to an NHL - record $ 124 million contract extension at 13 years , the second - longest term of any contract in the NHL after New York Islanders goaltender Rick DiPietro 's 15-year contract .
Despite the Capitals ' young defense and injuries to key players such as Michael Nylander and Brian Pothier , Boudreau engineered a remarkable turnaround .
Aided by key acquisitions at the trade deadline ( Matt Cooke , Sergei Fedorov and Cristobal Huet ) , Ovechkin 's NHL - leading 65 goals , and Mike Green 's league defensemen - leading 18 goals , the Capitals won the Southeast Division title for the first time since the 2000–01 season , edging out the Carolina Hurricanes for the Division title on the final game of the season .
Washington 's remarkable end - of - season run included winning 11 of the final 12 regular season games .
The Capitals became the first team in NHL history to make the playoffs after being ranked 14th or lower in their conference standings at the season 's midpoint .
For the post - season , the Capitals drew the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round and managed to force a Game 7 after being down three games to one in the series .
However , they ultimately lost to the Flyers 3–2 in overtime .
After the season concluded , Boudreau 's efforts were rewarded with a long - term contract extension .
RETURN TO PLAYOFFS AND FIRST PRESIDENT 'S
TROPHY
( 2008–14 ) Section::::Return to playoffs and first President 's Trophy ( 2008–14 ) .
The accolades for the team continued to grow after the end of the season .
Alexander Ovechkin won the Art Ross Trophy , the Maurice " Rocket " Richard Trophy , the Hart Memorial Trophy and the Lester B. Pearson Award , becoming the first player in NHL history to win all four awards in the same season .
He also was the first player to win an MVP award in any major sport in the Washington , D.C. , area since Joe Theismann won the National Football League ( NFL ) MVP award in 1983 .
Moreover , Ovechkin was also named an NHL First Team All - Star and became the first player since 1953 to be named as such in each of his first three years in the NHL .
Nicklas Backstrom was a finalist for the Calder Trophy , but ended up second to the Chicago Blackhawks ' Patrick Kane , though Backstrom was nonetheless selected to the All - Star Rookie Team .
In addition to player awards , head coach Bruce Boudreau won the Jack Adams Award for the NHL 's coach of the year .
Ovechkin and Mike Green were named to the Sporting News All - Star Team , with Ovechkin being the Sporting News Player of the Year .
The 2008–09 season was highlighted by the play of Mike Green ( who was the third of the Capitals ' three first - round selections in Ovechkin 's draft year ) and Ovechkin .
Green led all NHL defensemen in goals and points , also setting the record for the longest consecutive goal scoring streak by a defenseman with eight games .
Ovechkin won his second Hart Trophy , his second Lester B. Pearson Award and his second Maurice " Rocket " Richard Trophy .
The Capitals finished the regular season with a record of 50–24–8 and a team - record 108 points , and they won their second consecutive Southeast Division championship .

After again defeating the New York Rangers in five games in the first round , they were swept by the Tampa Bay Lightning in the Eastern Conference Semi - finals .
The Capitals started the 2011–12 season with a record of 7–0 , but they only won five of their next 15 games .
As a result , general manager George McPhee fired head coach Boudreau , hiring Capitals legend Dale Hunter as his replacement .
By the end of the 2011–12 season , the team 's top two goaltenders , Michal Neuvirth and Tomas Vokoun , were injured and the Capitals were required to lean on their goaltending prospect Braden Holtby to help the team into the 2012 playoffs .
The Capitals made a strong push and finished with the seventh overall seed in East , draining the defending champion Boston Bruins in the first round .
The Capitals shocked the NHL by defeating the heavily favored Bruins in seven games on an overtime goal by Joel Ward .
Every game in the series was decided by a one - goal margin ; previously , no single series in the Stanley Cup playoffs had ever gone as far as six or seven games while neither team ever held more than a one - goal lead .
The Capitals then advanced to the second round to face the top - seeded New York Rangers .
The series again went seven games , ending with a 2–1 Rangers victory at Madison Square Garden .
Following the season 's end , head coach Dale Hunter announced he would step down .
Adam Oates was later named permanent head coach of the team .
The lockout - shortened 2012–13 season saw the Capitals off to a rocky start , as they managed just two wins in their first ten games .
The team rebounded to win the Southeast Division , thereby earning the third seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs .
Unfortunately for Washington , the Capitals ' playoff woes continued as they again fell to the Rangers in seven games .
In the 2013–14 season , the Capitals started the season winning five of their first ten games .
The Capitals struggled to stay in a playoff spot and ultimately missed the playoffs for the first time since 2006–07 .

HISTORICAL Section::::Historical .
WTOP - TV ( channel 9 ) picked up television coverage for the Capitals ' first three seasons , covering 15 road games in the 1974–1975 season .
Legendary sportscaster Warner Wolf was the commentator for the first season , followed by a simulcast of radio coverage .
The Capitals moved to longtime home WDCA ( channel 20 ) in the 1977–1978 season .
WDCA later split games with HTS / CSN upon its founding in 1984 .
The 1991–1992 season illustrates a typical arrangement :
WDCA showed 20 road games and any road playoff games , while HTS picked up 34 home games and any home playoff games , leaving 28 regular - season games not televised .
After 19 seasons on WDCA , the Capitals moved their over - the - air broadcasts to WBDC ( channel 50 ) for the 1995–1996 season .
All 82 games were televised for the first time in the 2001–2002 season .
The Capitals have not aired any games over - the - air locally since the end of the 2005 - 2006 season .
WTOP ( 1500 AM ) was the Capitals ' first radio home through the 1986–1987 season .
After nine years on WMAL ( 630 AM ) , the games returned to 1500 AM for the 1996 - 1997 season .
Ron Weber was the first announcer , and never missed a game through his retirement at the end of the 1996–1997 season .
WJFK - FM began airing postseason games during the 2008 playoffs .
1500 AM , since renamed WFED , remained the flagship station until 2012 , when WJFK took over all coverage .
WFED continues to broadcast games as a network affiliate .
This is primarily to take advantage of its 50,000-watt clear - channel signal , which brings Capitals games to the entire eastern half of North America at night .
Weber rejoined current announcers Walton and Sabourin for the first period of Game 4 of the 2018 Stanley Cup Final .
WJFK - FM attracted controversy when it elected to drop the Capitals in the 2016–2017 season , leaving the Capitals to air solely on WFED .
However , WFED 's signal is unusable in some portions of the Washington suburbs at night , since it is directed north - south to protect co - channel KSTP .
The Washington Wizards also took priority over the Capitals on WFED in case of a conflict , leading to some games in which the only home broadcast was available via Internet streaming .
The team responded to fan complaints by reaching a temporary deal in January 2017 to place the rest of its games on WWDC - HD2 , which is available metro - wide to those with HD Radios and has a low - powered analog signal that covers the city itself .
The Capitals reached a deal to return to WJFK - FM for the 2017–2018 season .
LOGOS AND JERSEYS Section::::Logos and jerseys .
The Capitals took to the ice in red , white and blue jerseys featuring contrast - colored shoulders and stars on the chest and sleeves .
The team originally had red , white , and blue pants options , but retired the white pants only after a few games in their first season , and the red ones at season 's end .
The blue pants would eventually become the only option used .
Prior to the start of the 1995–96 season , in an attempt to modernize the look and improve merchandise sales , the team abandoned its traditional red , white and blue color scheme in favor of a blue , black , and bronze palette with an American bald eagle with five stars as its logo .
The alternate logo depicted the Capitol building with crossed hockey sticks behind .
For the 1997–98 season , the team unveiled a black alternate jersey , devoid of blue with bronze stripes on the ends of sleeves and at the waist .
Prior to the 2000–01 season , the team retired its blue road jersey in favor of this , but still kept the white jersey for home games .
The Capitals unveiled new uniforms on June 22 , 2007 , which coincided with the NHL Entry Draft and the new league - wide adaptation of the -designed uniform system for 2007–08 .
The change marked a return to the red , white and blue color scheme originally used from 1974 to 1995 .
The new primary logo is reminiscent of the original Capitals ' logo , complete with a hockey stick formed by the letter " t " ; it also includes a new feature not present in the original logo in the form of three stars representing DC , Maryland and Virginia .
More simply , the stars are a reference to the flag of Washington , D.C. , which is in turn based on the shield of George Washington 's family coat of arms .
The new alternate logo uses an eagle in the shape of a " W " with the silhouette of the United States Capitol building in the negative space below .
For the 2011 NHL Winter Classic , the Capitals wore a white jersey honoring the franchise 's past with the original logo .
The jersey resembled the one the franchise wore from 1974 to 1995 .
Instead of wearing the combination of blue pants and white helmets the team used when it played at the Capital Centre , the Capitals chose red pants and helmets for the New Year 's Day game .
The Capitals wore the same jersey , minus the NHL Winter Classic patch , on February 1 , 2011 , to honor Hockey Hall of Fame winger Dino Ciccarelli .
The Capitals announced on September 16 , 2011 , that they would wear a third jersey modeled after the Winter Classic jersey for 16 road games during the 2011–12 season .
For the 2015 Winter Classic , which took place on New Year 's Day at Nationals Park in Washington , D.C. , the Capitals wore a newly designed jersey intended to pay homage to hockey 's outdoor roots .
The primary color of the jersey was a vintage deep red .
The addition of stripes on the shoulders , waist and legs brought in elements of Washington 's professional hockey jerseys from the 1930s , predating the Capitals franchise 's formation in the 1970s .
A large " W " on the front of the jersey , topped with the common three stars , offset in blue to contrast the white " Capitals " word - mark .
Starting with the 2015–16 season , the Capitals will wear their throwback red third jerseys , replacing the white Winter Classic thirds .
Prior to the 2017–18 season , the NHL announced a new partnership with Adidas , and the Capitals unveiled new uniforms with minor changes .
There were no third jerseys during that season , but the return of the program in the 2018–19 season saw the return of the Capitals ' red throwback uniforms as their alternates .
For the 2018 Stadium Series , the Capitals used newly - designed navy uniforms , honoring the fact that the game was held at the U.S. Naval Academy .
The chest logo was based on the regular stylized " Capitals " logo , but shortened to " Caps " , the nickname commonly used for the team .
There were also features honoring various aspects of D.C. , as well as the presence of a slightly altered W logo from the 2015 Winter Classic on the pants .
