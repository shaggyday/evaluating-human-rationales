JERSEY POUND
The pound is the currency of Jersey .
Jersey is in currency union with the United Kingdom , and the Jersey pound is not a separate currency but is an issue of banknotes and coins by the States of Jersey denominated in pound sterling , in a similar way to the banknotes issued in Scotland and Northern Ireland ( see Banknotes of the pound sterling ) .
It can be exchanged at par with other sterling coinage and notes ( see also sterling zone ) .
For this reason , ISO 4217 does not include a separate currency code for the Jersey pound , but where a distinct code is desired JEP is generally used .
Both Jersey and Bank of England notes are legal tender in Jersey and circulate together , alongside the Guernsey pound and Scottish banknotes .
The Jersey notes are not legal tender in the United Kingdom but are legal currency , so creditors and traders may accept them if they so choose .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The livre was the currency of Jersey until 1834 .
It consisted of French coins which , in the early 19th century , were exchangeable for sterling at a rate of 26 livres = 1 pound .
After the livre was replaced by the franc in France in 1795 , the supply of coins in Jersey dwindled leading to difficulties in trade and payment .
In 1834 , an Order in Council adopted the pound sterling as Jersey 's sole official legal tender , although French copper coins continued to circulate alongside British silver coins , with 26 sous equal to the shilling .
Because the sous remained the chief small - change coins , when a new copper coinage was issued for Jersey in 1841 , it was based on a penny worth of a shilling , the equivalent of 2 sous .
This system continued until 1877 , when a penny of of a shilling was introduced .
Along with the rest of the British Isles , Jersey decimalised in 1971 and began issuing a full series of circulating coins from ½p to 50p .
£ 1 and £ 2 denominations followed later .
As of December 2005 , there was £ 64.7 m of Jersey currency in circulation .
A profit of £ 2.8 m earned on the issue of Jersey currency was received by the Treasurer of the States in 2005 .

Initially , each new coin featured one of the coats of arms of the 12 parishes of Jersey .
These were followed by a series of coins featuring sailing ships built in the island .
The motto round the milled edge of Jersey pound coins is :
Caesarea Insula ( " island of Jersey " in Latin ) .
Jersey £ 1 coins ceased to be legal tender in Jersey on 15 October 2017 to coincide with the withdrawal of the circular £ 1 coin in the UK .
The UK 's new 12-sided £ 1 coin is the only £ 1 coin that is legal tender in the Island .
HISTORY Section::::History .
In 1834 , an Order in Council adopted the pound sterling as Jersey 's sole official legal tender to replace the Jersey livre , although French copper coins continued to circulate alongside British silver coins , with 26 sous equal to the shilling .
Because the sous remained the chief small - change coins , when a new copper coinage was issued for Jersey in 1841 , it was based on a penny worth of a shilling , the equivalent of 2 sous .
In 1841 , copper , and shilling coins were introduced , followed by bronze and shilling in 1866 .
In 1877 a penny of of a shilling was introduced , and the system changed to 12 pence to the shilling .
Bronze , and shilling were introduced .
This was the only issue of the shilling denomination .
Between 1949 and 1952 the end of the German occupation of the Channel Islands was marked by one million commemorative Liberation pennies that were struck for Jersey .
In 1957 , a nickel - brass 3 pence coin was introduced carrying the denomination " one fourth of a shilling " .
The 1957 and 1960 issues were round , with a dodecagonal version introduced in 1964 .
In 1968 , 5 and 10 pence coins were introduced , followed by 50 pence in 1969 and ½p , 1p and 2 pence in 1971 when decimalisation took place .
All had the same composition and size as the corresponding British coins .
The reverse of the first issue of decimal coinage bore the coat of arms of Jersey as had previous coins .
The ½ penny coin was last minted in 1981 .
A square 1 pound coin was issued in circulation in 1981 to mark the bicentenary of the Battle of Jersey .
The square pound could not be accepted by vending machines and was not issued after 1981 although it remains in circulation today .
When the rest of the British Isles started to introduce a standardised pound coin in 1983 , Jersey changed to a round coin to match .
The square version although rare is still used in the islands .
Neither round nor square versions of the coin are as common in Jersey as the 1 pound note .
20 pence coins were introduced in 1982 and 2 pound coins in 1998 .
BANKNOTES Section::::Banknotes .
In 1797 Hugh Godfray and Company , a wine merchant , opened Jersey 's first bank ( later called the Jersey Old Bank ) and issued £ 1 notes .
Due to the shortage of livre tournois coinage , individuals and companies issued a large number of low value notes until in 1813 the States laid down that notes had to have a minimum value of £ 1 .
Until 1831 , a large number of bodies and individuals in Jersey issued their own banknotes .
The parishes of Jersey issued notes , as did the Vingtaine de la Ville .
Legislation in 1831 attempted to regulate such issues by requiring note issuers to be backed by two guarantors , but the parishes and the Vingtaine de la Ville were exempted from the regulatory provisions .
Most of the notes were 1 pound denominations , although at least one 5 pound issue was made .
These locally produced notes , which were often issued to fund public works , ceased to be issued after the 1890s .
During the German occupation in the Second World War , a shortage of coinage ( partly caused by occupying troops taking away coins as souvenirs ) led to the passing of the Currency Notes ( Jersey ) Law on 29 April 1941 .
A series of 2 shilling notes ( blue lettering on orange paper ) were issued .
The law was amended on 29 November 1941 to provide for further issues of notes of various denominations , and a series of banknotes designed by Edmund Blampied was issued by the States of Jersey in denominations of 6 pence , 1 , 2 and 10 shillings , and 1 pound .
The six pence note was designed by Blampied in such a way that the wording of the word six on the reverse incorporated an outsized " X " so that when the note was folded , the result was the resistance symbol " V " for victory . !
