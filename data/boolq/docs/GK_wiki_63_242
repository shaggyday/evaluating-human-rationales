ME to WE runs volunteer trips for various groups to a number of developing countries around the world , such as China , Ecuador , India , Kenya , and Nicaragua .
Participants volunteer in communities where ME to WE 's charity partner WE Charity ( formerly known as Free The Children ) has longstanding relationships , and they contribute to the advancement of those projects â€“ by helping with construction of schools or water wells .
Many practitioners and experts view this as voluntourism , an activity that helps affluent individuals across the North feel better about themselves .
Many children reveal that they have become " good people " through these efforts , but viewing poverty first hand .
