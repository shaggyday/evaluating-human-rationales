EUROCARD ( PAYMENT CARD )
Eurocard was a credit card , introduced in 1964 by a Swedish banker in the Wallenberg family as an alternative to American Express .
In 1968 it signed a deal with the Interbank Card Association ( today 's MasterCard ) so that their cards were accepted by each other 's networks ; this eventually led to a joint venture known as Maestro International in 1992 and merger in 2002 .
Its operations were relocated to Belgium in the late 1960s , and the card became the dominant brand in North and Central Europe between 1970 and 2002 .
It was eventually replaced by the Mastercard brand in most locations , but its logo is still used in some countries .
HISTORY Section::::History .
In 1965 , Eurocard International N.V. was established , based in Brussels , as a not - for - profit membership association of European banks .
Its operational entity was established as European Payment System Services ( EPSS ) .
In 1968 , Eurocard International and the Interbank Card Association entered into a strategic alliance , in which both issuer 's cards would be accepted on either network .
This allowed the ICA to get an instant European acceptance network , and Eurocard to get accepted worldwide .
Eurocard International got the sole license to issue the ICA 's Master Charge ( later MasterCard ) cards in Europe .
In 1992 , Eurocard International N.V. , Eurocheque International C.V. and Eurocheque International Holding N.V. merged into a single company , Europay International S.A. , and were relocated to Waterloo , Belgium .
This location also housed the Europe , Middle - East and Africa region of MasterCard International , and the seat of the Eurocard - MasterCard joint - venture , Maestro International .
In 2002 , Europay International and MasterCard International merged .
The name Europay disappeared , and the new organisation was later renamed MasterCard Worldwide , with the headquarters in Waterloo renamed MasterCard Europe .
In 2008 , Eurocard was taken over by the Swedish Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken .
Eurocard has always been the dominant brand in Central European countries , more specifically in Germany , the Netherlands and Austria .
It lagged behind Visa in Southern European countries , such as Spain and France .
ACCEPTANCE MARK
Section::::Acceptance mark .
Today , the Eurocard name exists in combination with the MasterCard acceptance mark as a product name .
This means that the Eurocard name is still used on a card , although only the MasterCard logo is displayed at locations which accept MasterCard cards .
The Eurocard logo is not used any more , as the acceptance mark is discontinued and merged into MasterCard .
However , the use of Eurocard as a brand for MasterCard credit cards is limited to Scandinavian countries and the Baltic countries .
In other former Eurocard markets , such as the German speaking countries , this brand was fully replaced by the MasterCard brand .
