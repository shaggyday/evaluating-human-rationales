GOOGLE PAY SEND
Google Pay Send ( formerly Google Wallet ) is a peer - to - peer payments service developed by Google that allows people to send and receive money from a mobile device or desktop computer at no cost to either sender or receiver .
When set up , a Google Pay account must be linked to an existing debit card or bank account in the United States or United Kingdom .
Google Pay Send can be used through the Google Pay Send app and Gmail .
The app is available for Android devices running Android 4.0 and above , and for iOS devices running iOS 7.0 and above .
Since 2018 , Android Pay and Google Wallet has unified into a single pay system called Google Pay .
Google Pay Send , a feature included inside Google Pay , has replaced the Google Wallet service .
SERVICE Section::::Service .
Google Pay is structured to allow its patrons to send money to each other .
To send money , a Google Pay user enters the email address or phone number of the recipient .
The recipient must then link that phone number or email address to a bank account in order to access those funds .
If the recipient also has a Google Pay account , the funds will post to that account directly .
Users can link up to two bank accounts when the Wallet account is created .
Received money goes to the Google Pay Balance and stays there until the user decides to cash out to a linked account .
The Google Pay app is available for free from either Google Play or the App Store .
After downloading the app , the user creates a four - digit personal identification number ( PIN ) for managing everything within their Google Pay account .
The PIN verifies access to the Wallet app on the user 's mobile device .
Before it was discontinued on June 30 , 2016 , the Google Wallet Card was recognized by the Cirrus network operated by MasterCard ( rather than the Plus network operated by Visa ) .
In September 2017 , Google launched its first major payments service outside the United States , in Tez , India .
REGIONAL AVAILABILITY Section::::Regional Availability .
Google Pay Send is available only in the US and the UK .
HISTORY EARLY HISTORY Section::::History .
Section::::Early history .
Google demonstrated the original version of the service at a press conference on May 26 , 2011 .
The first app was released in the US only on September 19 , 2011 .
On May 15 , 2013 , Google announced the integration of Google Wallet and Gmail , allowing users to send money through Gmail attachments .
While Google Wallet is available only in the United States , the Gmail integration is currently available in the U.S. and the United Kingdom .
The physical Google Wallet Card was an optional addition to the app which allowed users to make purchases at point - of - sale ( in stores or online ) drawing from funds in their Google Wallet account , attached debit card account , or bank account .
The card could also be used to withdraw cash at ATMs with no Google - associated fee , and could be used like a debit card for virtually any purpose , including such things as renting a car .
The Wallet Card was discontinued on June 30 , 2016 , and replaced with Android Pay .
The original version of Google Wallet allowed users to make point - of - sale purchases with their mobile devices using near - field communication ( NFC ) technology .
As of September 2015 , however , Google dropped NFC from Google Wallet , offering the technology only through Android Pay , which is a separate application available only to Android users .
As a result , any gift cards , loyalty programs , and promotional offers stored in an older version of Google Wallet could no longer be used .
For Android users , those outstanding offers and gift cards were automatically transferred to Android Pay .
For iOS users , instructions were provided to export the offers for alternative use .
There were no reported security problems with the NFC technology .
DISTINCTION FROM ANDROID PAY Section::::Distinction from Android Pay .
On February 23 , 2015 , Google announced that it would acquire the intellectual property of the carrier - backed competitor Softcard and integrate it into Google Wallet , and that American mobile network operators AT&T Mobility , T - Mobile US , and Verizon Wireless would bundle the Google Wallet app on their compatible devices .
The effective merger resulted in the new service known as Android Pay , a competitor to Apple Pay and similar NFC mobile payment service .
Separate from Android Pay , Google Wallet now allows peer - to - peer transactions for cases such as when people want to split the cost of shared expenses , reimburse each other , keep track of joint spending , or give money as a gift or loan .
While Android Pay is only available to Android users , Google Wallet is available on iOS and via Gmail as well .
For those using Android , the two products together ( Android Pay and Google Wallet ) offer a comprehensive payments management system , a " tool for staying in charge of the bank account .
" Users can link their bank accounts or debit cards to Android Pay and to their Google Wallet app .
With this approach , users can manage their money from one source , with the ability to : * Pay at point - of - sale by tapping their phone ( via Android Pay )
* Send and receive money to other individuals for free ( via the Google Wallet app )
* Keep track of spending ( through the optional Google Wallet Card ) BUSINESS MODEL
Section::::Business model .
Google does not charge users for access to Google Wallet .
Sending and receiving money is free , as is adding money to a Wallet Card through a linked bank account .
There are limits on how much money users can add to their Wallet Balance , withdraw from the linked account or card , or send and receive to other individuals .
These limits are set per transaction and within certain time periods .
Previously , a 2.9 % fee applied to funds added via debit card , although Google dropped that ability as of May 2 , 2016 .
Funds sent from a Wallet balance , debit card , or linked bank account are generally available to the recipient immediately , and if the recipient has his or her own Wallet account and card , he or she can make an immediate withdrawal of those funds from an ATM .
If the funds are drawn on the sender 's Wallet balance , the balance will also reflect this change immediately .
Any portion of funds drawn via a linked bank account will take two or three days to actually post to that account , though these funds will show as " pending " withdrawals on that account within 24 hours .
While Google does not have revenue coming in from the Wallet ecosystem ( the web service , app , and the Wallet Card ) , the product is part of a larger suite of e - commerce products , including Android Pay , which integrates loyalty programs and promotions from other businesses .
SECURITY Section::::Security .
Google Wallet protects payment credentials by storing user data on secure servers and encrypting all payment information with industry - standard SSL ( secure socket layer ) technology .
Full credit and debit card information is never shown in the app .
All Google Wallet users are also required to have a PIN to protect access to their Wallet account .
The payments PIN is used for :
* Gaining access to the Google Wallet app on a mobile device
* Making point - of - sale purchases with a Google Wallet Card
* Withdrawing cash with a Google Wallet Card at an ATM Google also recommends having a general passcode on mobile devices for additional security .
In some cases , users have to verify their identity in order to make certain transactions .
If prompted to do so , the user will visit the Wallet website and follow steps to ensure their accurate identity .
This is in adherence with US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation financial regulations that require payment providers to ensure customer identity .
If a Google Wallet Card is lost or stolen , users can immediately cancel access to it by signing into myaccount.google.com .
Google also offers the additional flexibility of temporarily locking the card if a user suspects that the card has simply been misplaced .
In the event of unauthorized transactions , Google Wallet Fraud Protection covers 100 % of verified unauthorized transactions made in the US reported within 120 days of the transaction .
Only US residents who have Wallet accounts associated with a US address are eligible for coverage under this policy .
CRITICISM Section::::Criticism .
Regarding an earlier version of Google Wallet ( in 2012 ) , an analysis by security company Nowsecure revealed that some card information stored by Google Wallet was accessible outside of the application .
It is suggested that hackers could create a way to intercept data by eavesdropping on Google Analytics , which monitors apps used on the Android OS .
A previous analysis by the same firm revealed a number of other exploits that have since been fixed .
PRIVACY Section::::Privacy .
Privacy concerns include the storing of data regarding payment information , transaction details , payment attempts and other information stored by Google indefinitely .
The privacy policy for Google Wallet , called the Google Payments Privacy Notice , indicates that much of the data is stored but may not be shared outside Google except under certain circumstances .
Information that may be collected upon signing up includes credit or debit card number and expiration date , address , phone number , date of birth , social security number , or taxpayer ID number .
Information that may be collected about a transaction made through Google Wallet includes date , time , and amount of transaction , merchant 's location and description , a description of goods or services purchased , any photo
the user associates with the transaction , the names and email addresses of sender and recipient , the type of payment method used , and a description of the reason for the transaction if included .
The storage of such personal information about users ' transactions is of significant financial value to a company that earns much of its revenue from data , but may be controversial to users aware of the policies .
Information collected is shared with Google 's affiliates , meaning other companies owned and controlled by Google Inc. , which can be used for their everyday business purposes .
They provide the option to opt out of certain sharing capacities with these affiliates .
Google states that it will only share personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Google in the following circumstances : *
As permitted under the Google Privacy Policy * As necessary to process your transaction and maintain your account * To complete your registration for a service provided by a third party PAYPAL LAWSUIT Section::::PayPal lawsuit .
Shortly after the launch of Google Wallet 's first iteration in 2011 , PayPal filed a lawsuit against Google and two former employees of PayPal – Osama Bedier and Stephanie Tilenius .
The complaint alleges " misappropriation of trade secrets " and " breach of fiduciary duty " .
The lawsuit revealed that Google had been negotiating with PayPal for two years to power payments on mobile devices .
But just as the deal was about to be signed , Google backed off and instead hired the PayPal executive negotiating the deal , Bedier .
The lawsuit noted that Bedier knew all of PayPal 's future plans for mobile payments , as well as an internal detailed analysis of Google 's weaknesses in the area .
Not only that , it accused him of storing " confidential information in locations such as his non - PayPal computers , non - PayPal e - mail account , and an account on the remote computing service called ' Dropbox ' . "
Google ran a competitor to PayPal , Google Checkout , from 2006 to 2013 .
In 2011 , Google Wallet replaced Checkout 's services , and development on Checkout was discontinued in 2013 .
