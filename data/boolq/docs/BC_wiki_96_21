CHECKMATE Checkmate ( often shortened to mate ) is a game position in chess and other chess - like games in which a player 's king is in check ( threatened with ) and there is no way to remove the threat .
Checkmating the opponent wins the game .
In chess , the king is never captured — the game ends as soon as the king is checkmated .
In formal games , most players an inevitably lost game before being checkmated .
It is usually considered bad etiquette to continue playing in a completely hopeless position .
If a player is not in check but has no legal move , then it is stalemate , and the game immediately ends in a draw .
A checkmating move is recorded in algebraic notation using the hash symbol " # " , for example : 34.Qg7 # . EXAMPLES Section::::Examples .
A checkmate may occur in as few as two moves on one side with all of the pieces still on the board ( as in Fool 's mate , in the opening phase of the game ) , in a middlegame position ( as in the 1956 game called the Game of the Century between Donald Byrne and Bobby Fischer ) , or after many moves with as few as three pieces in an endgame position .
ETYMOLOGY Section::::Etymology .
The term checkmate is , according to the Barnhart Etymological Dictionary , an alteration of the Persian phrase " shāh māt " ( ) which means , literally , " the King is helpless " .
Persian " māt " applies to the king but in Sanskrit " māta " ,
also pronounced " māt " , applied to his kingdom " traversed , measured across , and meted out " thoroughly by his opponent ; " māta " is the past participle of " mā " verbal root .
Others maintain that it means " the King is dead " , as chess reached Europe via the Islamic world , and Arabic māta ( ) means " died " or " is dead " .
However , in Pashto ( an Iranic language ) , the word māt ( ) still exists , meaning " destroyed , broken " .
Moghadam traced the etymology of the word mate .
It comes from a Persian verb mandan ( ) , meaning " to remain " , which is cognate with the Latin word and the Greek menō ( , which means " I remain " ) .
It means " remained " in the sense of " abandoned " and the formal translation is " surprised " , in the military sense of " ambushed " .
sheikh ( ) is the arabic word for the monarch .
Players would announce " Sheikh " when the king was in check .
" Māt " ( ) is a arabic adjective for dead " helpless " , or " defeated " .
So the king is in mate when he is ambushed , at a loss , helpless , defeated , or abandoned to his fate .
In modern Arabic , the word mate depicts a person who has died open - mouthed , staring , confused and unresponsive .
The words " stupefied " or " stunned " bear close correlation .
So a possible alternative would be to interpret mate as " unable to respond " .
A king is mate ( sheikh - mat )
then means a king is unable to respond , which would correspond to there being no response that a player 's king can make to their opponent 's final move .
This interpretation is much closer to the original intent of the game being not to kill a king but to leave him with no viable response other than surrender , which better matches the origin story detailed in the Shahnameh .
In modern parlance , the term checkmate is a metaphor for an irrefutable and strategic victory .
HISTORY Section::::History .
In early Sanskrit chess ( 500–700 ) , the king could be and this ended the game .
The Persians ( c. 700–800 ) introduced the idea of warning that the king was under attack ( announcing check in modern terminology ) .
This was done to avoid the early and accidental end of a game .
Later the Persians added the additional rule that a king could not be moved into check or left in check .
As a result , the king could not be captured , and checkmate was the only decisive way of ending a game .
Before about 1600 , the game could also be won by capturing all of the opponent 's pieces , leaving just a bare king .
This style of play is now called annihilation or robado .
In Medieval times , players began to consider it nobler to win by checkmate , so annihilation became a half - win for a while , until it was abandoned .
TWO MAJOR PIECES Section::::Two major pieces .
Two ( queens or rooks ) can easily checkmate on the edge of the board .
The process is to put the two pieces on adjacent or and gradually force the king to the side of the board , where one piece keeps the king on the edge of the board while the other delivers checkmate .
In the illustration , white checkmates by forcing the black king to the edge , one row at a time .
The same process can also be used to checkmate with two rooks , or with two queens .
BASIC CHECKMATES Section::::Basic checkmates .
There are four fundamental checkmates when one side has only his king and the other side has only the minimum needed to force checkmate , i.e. ( 1 ) one queen , ( 2 ) one rook , ( 3 ) two bishops on opposite - colored squares , or ( 4 ) a bishop and a knight .
The king must help in accomplishing all of these checkmates .
If the superior side has more material , checkmates are easier .
The checkmate with the queen is the most common , and easiest to achieve .
It often occurs after a pawn has queened .
A checkmate with the rook is also common , but a checkmate with the two bishops or with a bishop and knight only occur relatively infrequently .
The two bishop checkmate is fairly easy to accomplish , but the bishop and knight checkmate is difficult and requires precision .
KING AND QUEEN Section::::King and queen .
The first two diagrams show representatives of the basic checkmate positions with a queen , which can occur on any edge of the board .
Naturally , the exact position can vary from the diagram .
In the first of the checkmate positions , the queen is directly in front of the opposing king and the white king is protecting its queen .
In the second checkmate position , the kings are in opposition and the queen mates on the ( or ) of the king .
tleft
Outer row mate tleft
qlkl
White checkmates easily .
With the side with the queen to move , checkmate can be forced in at most ten moves from any starting position , with optimal play by both sides , but usually fewer moves are required .
In positions in which a pawn has just promoted to a queen , at most nine moves are required .
In the position diagrammed , White checkmates easily by confining the black king to a rectangle and shrinking the rectangle to { { chessglossforcing moveforce } } the king to the edge of the board :

The white queen blocks off all possible moves for Black , regardless of where the white king is placed on the board .
fen=8/2Q5 / k7/2K5/8/8/8/8 size=23 align = tleft
reverse
= false
header=
footer=
This is a stalemate if Black is to move .
The superior side must be careful to not stalemate the opposing king , whereas the defender would like to get into such a position .
There are two general types of stalemate positions that can occur , which the stronger side must avoid .
KING AND ROOK Section::::King and rook .
tleft Checkmate with the rook ( a right triangle mate )
A cornered checkmate with the rook tleft
The first diagram shows the basic checkmate position with a rook , which can occur on any edge of the board .
The black king can be on any square on the edge of the board , the white king is in opposition to it , and the rook can check from any square on the rank or file ( assuming that it can not be captured ) .
The second diagram shows a slightly different position where the kings are not in opposition but the defending king must be in a corner .
With the side with the rook to move , checkmate can be forced in at most sixteen moves from any starting position .
Again , see for a demonstration of how the king and rook versus king mate is achieved .
In the third diagram position , White checkmates by confining the black king to a rectangle and shrinking the rectangle to force the king to the edge of the board :

kd
Here are the two basic checkmate positions with two bishops ( on opposite - colored squares ) , which can occur in any corner .
( Two or more bishops on the same color , which could occur because of pawn underpromotion , can not checkmate . )
The first is a checkmate in the corner .
The second position is a checkmate in a side square next to the corner square .
With the side with the bishops to move , checkmate can be forced in at most nineteen moves , except in some very rare positions ( 0.03 % of the possible positions ) .
It is not too difficult for two bishops to force checkmate , with the aid of their king .
Two principles apply : *
The bishops are best when they are near the { { chessglosscenter } } of the board and on adjacent diagonals .
This cuts off the opposing king .
* The king must be used aggressively , in conjunction with the bishops .
{ { clear } } valign="top " tright From Seirawan Two bishops and king can force mate .
In the position from Seirawan , White wins by first forcing the black king to the side of the board , then to a corner , and then checkmates .
It can be any side of the board and any corner .
The process is : Note that this is not the shortest forced checkmate from this position .
Müller and Lamprecht give a fifteen - move solution ; however , it contains an inaccurate move by Black ( according to endgame tablebases ) .

kd 1.Kb6 would be stalemate .
One example of a stalemate is this position , where 1 . Kb6 ( marked with the x ) would be stalemate .
KING , BISHOP AND KNIGHT Section::::King , bishop and knight .
Of the basic checkmates , this is the most difficult one to { { chessglossforced mateforce } } , because these two pieces can not form a linear barrier to the enemy king from a distance .
Also , the checkmate can be forced only in a corner that the bishop controls .
valign="top
" + Checkmates with a bishop and a knight
Two basic checkmate positions are shown with a bishop and a knight , or the bishop and knight checkmate .
The first position is a checkmate by the bishop , with the black king in the corner .
The bishop can be on other squares along the diagonal , the white king and knight have to be on squares that attack g8 and h7 .
The second position is a checkmate by the knight , with the black king on a side square next to the corner .
The knight can be on other squares that check the black king .
The white king must be on a square to protect the bishop and cover a square not covered by the knight .
With the side with the bishop and knight to move , checkmate can be forced in at most thirty - three moves from any starting position , except those in which the defending king is initially forking the bishop and knight and it is not possible to defend both .
However , the mating process requires accurate play , since a few errors could result in a draw either by the fifty - move rule or stalemate .
Opinions differ as to whether or not a player should learn this checkmate procedure .
James Howell omits the checkmate with two bishops in his book because it rarely occurs but includes the bishop and knight checkmate .
Howell says that he has had it three times ( always on the defending side ) and that it occurs more often than the checkmate with two bishops .
On the other hand , Jeremy Silman includes the checkmate with two bishops but not the bishop plus knight checkmate because he has had it only once and his friend John Watson has never had it .
Silman says : ... mastering it would take a significant chunk of time .
Should the chess hopeful really spend many of his precious hours he 's put aside for chess study learning an endgame he will achieve ( at most ) only once or twice in his lifetime ?

White wins with 1.Rd8 # .
A back - rank checkmate is a checkmate delivered by a rook or queen along a back rank ( that is , the row on which the pieces [ not pawns ] stand at the start of the game ) in which the mated king is unable to move up the board because the king is blocked by friendly pieces ( usually pawns ) on the second rank .
An example of a back - rank checkmate is shown in the diagram .
It is also known as the corridor mate .

Scholar 's Mate — Black is checkmated .
Scholar 's Mate ( also known as the four - move checkmate ) is the checkmate achieved by the moves :
The moves might be played in a different order or in slight variation , but the basic idea is the same : the queen and bishop combine in a simple mating attack on f7 ( or f2 if Black is performing the mate ) .
There are also other ways to checkmate in four moves .

Final position
A smothered mate is a checkmate delivered by a knight in which the mated king is unable to move because it is surrounded ( or smothered ) by its own pieces .
The mate is usually seen in a corner of the board , since fewer pieces are needed to surround the king there .
The most common form of smothered mate is seen in the adjacent diagram .
The knight on f7 delivers mate to the king on h8 which is prevented from escaping the check by the rook on g8 and the pawns on g7 and h7 .
Similarly , White can be mated with the white king on h1 and the knight on f2 .
Analogous mates on a1 and a8 are rarer , because { { chessglosskingside } } castling is the more common as it safely places the king closer to the corner than it would had the castling occurred on the { { chessglossqueenside } } .

In some rare positions it is possible to force checkmate with a king and knight versus a king and pawn .

A similar position with the knight on d2 is more than 500 years old , identified as " Partito n. 23 " by Luca Pacioli , in his MS De ludo scachorum ( Latin for " The game of chess " ) , dated 1498 and recently reprinted ( Gli scacchi ) by Aboca Museum Edizioni .
UNUSUAL
MATES Section::::Unusual mates .
There are also positions in which a king and a knight can checkmate a king and a bishop , knight , or rook ; or a king and a bishop can checkmate a king with a bishop on the other color of squares or with a knight , but the checkmate can not be forced if there is no other material on the board ( see the diagrams for some examples ) .
Nevertheless , it keeps these { { chessglossmaterial } } combinations from being ruled a draw because of " insufficient mating material " or " impossibility of checkmate " under the FIDE rules of chess .
The U.S. Chess Federation rules are different .
In a typical position with a { { chessglossminor piece } } versus a minor piece , a player would be able to claim a draw if he has a limited amount of time left .

The defender 's task is easy — he simply has to avoid moving into a position in which he can be checkmated on the next move , and he always has another move available in such situations .
In the third diagram , one knight is guarding c1 , leaving the other knight to try to checkmate .
After 1 .

But if White plays { { nowrap2 . Nd4 } } , Black is stalemated .
Under some circumstances , two knights and a king can force checkmate against a king and pawn ( or rarely more pawns ) .
The winning plan , quite difficult to execute in practice , is to blockade the enemy pawn(s ) with one of the knights , maneuver the enemy king into a stalemated position , then bring the other knight over to checkmate .
( See two knights endgame . )
Three knights chess problems , since at least one of the knights must be a promoted piece , and there is rarely a reason to promote a pawn to a piece other than a queen ( see underpromotion ) .
