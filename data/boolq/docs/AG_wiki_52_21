FATHER 'S DAY
Father 's Day is a celebration honoring fathers and celebrating fatherhood , paternal bonds , and the influence of fathers in society .
In Catholic Europe , it has been celebrated on March 19 ( St. Joseph 's Day ) since the Middle Ages .
This celebration was brought by the Spanish and Portuguese to Latin America , where March 19 is often still used for it , though many countries in Europe and the Americas have adopted the U.S. date , which is the third Sunday of June .
It is celebrated on various days in many parts of the world , most commonly in the months of March , April and June .
It complements similar celebrations honoring family members , such as Mother 's Day , Siblings Day , and Grandparents ' Day .
HISTORY AND TRADITIONS EARLY HISTORY Section::::History and traditions .
Section::::Early history .
A customary day for the celebration of fatherhood in Catholic Europe is known to date back to at least the Middle Ages , and it is observed on 19 March , as the feast day of Saint Joseph , who is referred to as the fatherly Nutritor Domini ( " Nourisher of the Lord " ) in Catholicism and " the putative father of Jesus " in southern European tradition .
This celebration was brought to the Americas by the Spanish and Portuguese , and in Latin America , Mother 's Day is still celebrated on 19 March .
The Catholic Church actively supported the custom of a celebration of fatherhood on St. Joseph 's day from either the last years of the 14th century or from the early 15th century , apparently on the initiative of the Franciscans .
In the Coptic Church , the celebration of fatherhood is also observed on St Joseph 's Day , but the Copts observe this celebration on July 20 .
This Coptic celebration may date back to the fifth century .
IN THE UNITED STATES
BEGINNINGS Section::::In
the United States .
Section::::Beginnings .
Father 's Day was not celebrated in the US , outside Catholic traditions , until the 20th century .
As a civic celebration in the US , it was inaugurated in the early 20th century to complement Mother 's Day by celebrating fathers and male parenting .
After Anna Jarvis ' successful promotion of Mother 's Day in Grafton , West Virginia , the first observance of a " Father 's Day " was held on July 5 , 1908 , in Fairmont , West Virginia , in the Williams Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church South , now known as Central United Methodist Church .
Grace Golden Clayton was mourning the loss of her father , when in December 1907 , the Monongah Mining Disaster in nearby Monongah killed 361 men , 250 of them fathers , leaving around a thousand fatherless children .
Clayton suggested that her pastor Robert Thomas Webb honor all those fathers .
Clayton 's event did not have repercussions outside Fairmont for several reasons , among them : the city was overwhelmed by other events , the celebration was never promoted outside the town itself and no proclamation of it was made by the city council .
Also , two events overshadowed this event : the celebration of Independence Day July 4 , 1908 , with 12,000 attendants and several shows including a hot air balloon event , which took over the headlines in the following days , and the death of a 16-year - old girl on July 4 .
The local church and council were overwhelmed and they did not even think of promoting the event , and it was not celebrated again for many years .
The original sermon was not reproduced by the press and it was lost .
Finally , Clayton was a quiet person , who never promoted the event and never talked to other persons about it .
FAILED ATTEMPTS AT
ESTABLISHING
A FATHER 'S DAY Section::::Failed attempts at establishing a Father 's Day .
In 1911 , Jane Addams proposed that a citywide Father 's Day celebration be held in Chicago , but she was turned down .
In 1912 , there was a Father 's Day celebration in Vancouver , Washington , suggested by Methodist pastor J.J. Berringer of the Irvington Methodist Church .
They mistakenly believed that they had been the first to celebrate such a day .
They followed a 1911 suggestion by the Portland Oregonian .
Harry C. Meek , a member of Lions Clubs International , claimed that he had first come up with the idea for Father 's Day in 1915 .
Meek said that the third Sunday in June was chosen because it was his birthday .
The Lions Club has named him the " Originator of Father 's Day " .
Meek made many efforts to promote Father 's Day and make it an official holiday .
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HOLIDAY Section::::Establishment of the holiday .
On June 19 , 1910 , a Father 's Day celebration was held at the YMCA in Spokane , Washington by Sonora Smart Dodd .
Her father , the civil war veteran William Jackson Smart , was a single parent who raised his six children there .
She was also a member of Old Centenary Presbyterian Church ( now Knox Presbyterian Church ) , where she first proposed the idea .
After hearing a sermon about Jarvis ' Mother 's Day in 1909 at Central Methodist Episcopal Church , she told her pastor that fathers should have a similar holiday to honor them .
Although she initially suggested June 5 , her father 's birthday , the pastors did not have enough time to prepare their sermons , and the celebration was deferred to the third Sunday in June .
Several local clergymen accepted the idea , and on June 19 , 1910 , the first Father 's Day , " sermons honoring fathers were presented throughout the city " .
However , in the 1920s , Dodd stopped promoting the celebration because she was studying at the Art Institute of Chicago , and it faded into relative obscurity , even in Spokane .
In the 1930s , Dodd returned to Spokane and started promoting the celebration again , raising awareness at a national level .
She had the help of those trade groups that would benefit most from the holiday , for example the manufacturers of ties , tobacco pipes , and any traditional present for fathers .
By 1938 , she had the help of the Father 's Day Council , founded by the New York Associated Men 's Wear Retailers to consolidate and systematize the holiday 's commercial promotion .
Americans resisted the holiday for its first few decades , viewing it as nothing more than an attempt by merchants to replicate the commercial success of Mother 's Day , and newspapers frequently featured cynical and sarcastic attacks and jokes .
However , the said merchants remained resilient and even incorporated these attacks into their advertisements .
By the mid-1980s , the Father 's Day Council wrote , " ( ... )
[ Father 's Day ] has become a Second Christmas for all the men 's gift - oriented industries . "
A bill to accord national recognition of the holiday was introduced in Congress in 1913 .
In 1916 , President Woodrow Wilson went to Spokane to speak at a Father 's Day celebration and he wanted to make it an officially recognized federal holiday , but Congress resisted , fearing that it would become commercialized .
US President Calvin Coolidge recommended in 1924 that the day be observed throughout the entire nation , but he stopped short at issuing a national proclamation .
Two earlier attempts to formally recognize the holiday had been defeated by Congress .
In 1957 , Maine Senator Margaret Chase Smith wrote a Father 's Day proposal accusing Congress of ignoring fathers for 40 years while honoring mothers , thus " [ singling ] out
just one of our two parents " .
In 1966 , President Lyndon B. Johnson issued the first presidential proclamation honoring fathers , designating the third Sunday in June as Father 's Day .
Six years later , the day was made a permanent national holiday when President Richard Nixon signed it into law in 1972 .
In addition to Father 's Day , International Men 's Day is celebrated in many countries on November 19 in honor of men and boys who are not fathers .
SPELLING
Section::::Spelling .
In the United States , Dodd used the " Fathers ' Day " spelling on her original petition for the holiday , but the spelling " Father 's Day " was already used in 1913 when a bill was introduced to the U.S. Congress as the first attempt to establish the holiday , and it was still spelled the same way when its creator was commended in 2008 by the U.S. Congress .

The tradition of Father 's Day is especially prevalent in Eastern Germany .

Men would be seated in a wooden cart and carried to the village 's plaza , and the mayor would award a prize to the father who had the most children , usually a big piece of ham .
