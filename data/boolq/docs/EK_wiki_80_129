On 12 June 2006 the SAA was signed at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Luxembourg .

The Commission submitted the questionnaire on accession preparation to the Albanian government .
On 14 April 2010 Albania submitted answers to the European Commission 's questionnaire , but candidacy status was not granted by the EU in December 2010 due to the long - lasting political row in the country .

On 15 December 2010 visa - free access to the Schengen area entered into force and on 10 October 2012
the European Commission recommended that Albania be granted EU candidate status , subject to the completion of key measures in certain areas .
The parliament in August 2012 rejected a proposal to abolish immunity for parliament members , ministers and people in some other official positions .
The EU required this to be abolished along with 11 other main issues , so candidate status was further delayed .
However , in September 2012 a constitutional amendment was unanimously passed which limited the immunity of parliamentarians .
In October 2012 the European Commission evaluated the progress of Albania to comply with 12 key conditions to achieve official candidate status and start accession negotiations .
Four key priorities were found to be met , while two were well in progress and the remaining six were in moderate progress .
The report concluded that if Albania managed to hold a fair and democratic parliamentary election in June 2013 , and also implemented the remaining changes to comply with the eight key priorities still not fully met , then the Council of the European Union would recommended granting Albania official candidate status .
On 23 June 2013 Albania held a general election , generally regarded as free and fair .
The EU ambassador to Albania said on July 17 that Albania had met many of these conditions , and might be an official candidate by December 2013 .
On 16 October 2013 the European Commission released its annual reports on prospective member states which concluded that the Albanian election was held in an " orderly manner " and that progress had been made in meeting other conditions ; as such it recommended granting Albania candidate status .
On 5 December 2013 in an MEP meeting it was recommended that " ... the Council should acknowledge the progress made by Albania by granting it candidate status without undue delay . "
However , several states , including Denmark and the Netherlands , remained opposed to granting Albania candidate status until it demonstrated that its recent progress could be sustained .
Consequently , the Council of the European Union , at its meeting in December 2013 , agreed to postpone the decision on candidate status until June 2014 .
On 24 June 2014 , under the Greek EU Presidency , the Council of the European Union agreed to grant Albania candidate status , which was endorsed by the European Council a few days later .
This coincided with the 10th anniversary of the " Agenda 2014 " , proposed by the Greek Government in 2004 , as part of the EU - Western Balkans Summit in Thessaloniki , for boosting the integration of all the Western Balkan states into the European Union .
In March 2015 , at the fifth " High Level Dialogue meeting " between Albania and EU , the EU Commissioner for Enlargement ( Johannes Hahn ) notified Albania the setting of a start date for accession negotiations to begin still required the following two conditions to be met : 1 )
The government need to reopen political dialogue with the parliamentary opposition , 2 )
Albania must deliver quality reforms for all 5 earlier identified key areas not yet complied with ( public administration , rule of law , corruption , organised crime , fundamental rights ) .
This official stance , was fully supported by the European Parliament through its pass of a Resolution comment in April 2015 , which basically agreed with all conclusions drawn by the Commission 's latest 2014 Progress Report on Albania .
The Albanian Prime Minister outlined the next step of his government would be to submit a detailed progress report on the implementation of the 5 key reforms to the Commission in Autumn 2015 , and then he expected the accession negotiations should start shortly afterwards - before the end of 2015 .
The Albanian parliament approved constitutional amendments on justice reforms on 22 July 2016 .
Albania had hoped to open membership negotiations by December 2016 .
The Commission recommended the launch of negotiations on 9 November 2016 .
However , on 26 November Germany announced that it would veto the opening accession talks until 2018 .
In early 2017 , the European Parliament warned the government leaders that the parliamentary elections in June must be " free and fair " before negotiations could begin to admit the country into the Union .
The MEPs also expressed concern about the country 's selective justice , corruption , the overall length of judicial proceedings and political interference in investigations and court cases but the EU Press Release expressed some optimism : It is important for Albania to maintain today 's reform momentum and we must be ready to support it as much as possible in this process .
