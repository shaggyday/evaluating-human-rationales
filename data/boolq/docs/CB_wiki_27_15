The drink is named after London 's Buck 's Club , where it was invented as an excuse to begin drinking early ; it was first served in 1921 by a barman named Malachy McGarry ( who features in the works of P. G. Wodehouse as the barman of Buck 's Club and the Drones Club ) .
Traditionally , it is made by mixing two parts champagne and one part orange juice .
Some older recipes list grenadine as an additional ingredient , but the International Bartenders Association recipe does not include it .

Four years later , the mimosa cocktail was invented in Paris .
It also contains sparkling wine and orange juice , but in equal measures .
