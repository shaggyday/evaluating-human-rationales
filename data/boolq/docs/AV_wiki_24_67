HAZARD RATIO
In survival analysis , the hazard ratio ( HR ) is the ratio of the hazard rates corresponding to the conditions described by two levels of an explanatory variable .
For example , in a drug study , the treated population may die at twice the rate per unit time as the control population .
The hazard ratio would be 2 , indicating higher hazard of death from the treatment .
Or in another study , men receiving the same treatment may suffer a certain complication ten times more frequently per unit time than women , giving a hazard ratio of 10 .
Hazard ratios differ from relative risks and odds ratios in that RRs and ORs are cumulative over an entire study , using a defined endpoint , while HRs represent instantaneous risk over the study time period , or some subset thereof .
Hazard ratios suffer somewhat less from selection bias with respect to the endpoints chosen and can indicate risks that happen before the endpoint .
DEFINITION AND DERIVATION Section::::Definition and derivation .
Regression models are used to obtain hazard ratios and their confidence intervals .
The instantaneous hazard rate is the limit of the number of events per unit time divided by the number at risk , as the time interval approaches 0 .
where N(t ) is the number at risk at the beginning of an interval .
A hazard is the probability that a patient fails between formula_2 and formula_3 , given that he has survived up to time formula_2 , divided by formula_5 , as formula_5 approaches zero .
The hazard ratio is the effect on this hazard rate of a difference , such as group membership ( for example , treatment or control , male or female ) , as estimated by regression models that treat the log of the HR as a function of a baseline hazard formula_7 and a linear combination of explanatory variables : Such models are generally classed proportional hazards regression models ; the best known being the Cox semiparametric proportional hazards model , and the exponential , Gompertz and Weibull parametric models .
For two groups that differ only in treatment condition , the ratio of the hazard functions is given by formula_9 , where formula_10 is the estimate of treatment effect derived from the regression model .
This hazard ratio , that is , the ratio between the predicted hazard for a member of one group and that for a member of the other group , is given by holding everything else constant , i.e. assuming proportionality of the hazard functions .
For a continuous explanatory variable , the same interpretation applies to a unit difference .
Other HR models have different formulations and the interpretation of the parameter estimates differs accordingly .
INTERPRETATION Section::::Interpretation .
In its simplest form , the hazard ratio can be interpreted as the chance of an event occurring in the treatment arm divided by the chance of the event occurring in the control arm , or vice versa , of a study .
The resolution of these endpoints are usually depicted using Kaplan – Meier survival curves .
These curves relate the proportion of each group where the endpoint has not been reached .
The endpoint could be any dependent variable associated with the covariate ( independent variable ) , e.g. death , remission of disease or contraction of disease .
The curve represents the odds of an endpoint having occurred at each point in time ( the hazard ) .
The hazard ratio is simply the relationship between the instantaneous hazards in the two groups and represents , in a single number , the magnitude of distance between the Kaplan – Meier plots .
Hazard ratios do not reflect a time unit of the study .
The difference between hazard - based and time - based measures is akin to the difference between the odds of winning a race and the margin of victory .
When a study reports one hazard ratio per time period , it is assumed that difference between groups was proportional .
Hazard ratios become meaningless when this assumption of proportionality is not met .
If the proportional hazard assumption holds , a hazard ratio of one means equivalence in the hazard rate of the two groups , whereas a hazard ratio other than one indicates difference in hazard rates between groups .
The researcher indicates the probability of this sample difference being due to chance by reporting the probability associated with some test statistic .
For instance , the formula_10 from the Cox - model or the log - rank test might then be used to assess the significance of any differences observed in these survival curves .
Conventionally , probabilities lower than 0.05 are considered significant and researchers provide a 95 % confidence interval for the hazard ratio , e.g. derived from the standard deviation of the Cox - model regression coefficient ,
i.e. formula_10 .
Statistically significant hazard ratios can not include unity ( one ) in their confidence intervals .
THE PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS ASSUMPTION Section::::The proportional hazards assumption .
The proportional hazards assumption for hazard ratio estimation is strong and often unreasonable .
Complications , adverse effects and late effects are all possible causes of change in the hazard rate over time .
For instance , a surgical procedure may have high early risk , but excellent long term outcomes .
If the hazard ratio between groups remain constant , this is not a problem for interpretation .
However , interpretation of hazard ratios become impossible when selection bias exists between group .
For instance , a particularly risky surgery might result in the survival of a systematically more robust group who would have fared better under any of the competing treatment conditions , making it look as if the risky procedure was better .
Follow - up time is also important .
A cancer treatment associated with better remission rates , might on follow - up be associated with higher relapse rates .
The researchers ' decision about when to follow up is arbitrary and may lead to very different reported hazard ratios .
THE HAZARD RATIO AND SURVIVAL Section::::The hazard ratio and survival .
Hazard ratios are often treated as a ratio of death probabilities .
For example , a hazard ratio of 2 is thought to mean that a group has twice the chance of dying than a comparison group .
In the Cox - model , this can be shown to translate to the following relationship between group survival functions : formula_13 ( where r is the hazard ratio ) .
Therefore , with a hazard ratio of 2 , if formula_14 ( 20 % survived at time t ) ,
formula_15 ( 4 % survived at t ) .
The corresponding death probabilities are 0.8 and 0.96 .
It should be clear that the hazard ratio is a relative measure of effect and tells us nothing about absolute risk .
While hazard ratios allow for hypothesis testing , they should be considered alongside other measures for interpretation of the treatment effect , e.g. the ratio of median times ( median ratio ) at which treatment and control group participants are at some endpoint .
If the analogy of a race is applied , the hazard ratio is equivalent to the odds that an individual in the group with the higher hazard reaches the end of the race first .
The probability of being first can be derived from the odds , which is the probability of being first divided by the probability of not being first : * HR = P/(1 − P ) ; P = HR/(1 + HR ) .
In the previous example , a hazard ratio of 2 corresponds to a 67 % chance of an early death .
The hazard ratio does not convey information about how soon the death will occur .
THE HAZARD RATIO , TREATMENT EFFECT AND TIME - BASED ENDPOINTS Section::::The hazard ratio , treatment effect and time - based endpoints .
Treatment effect depends on the underlying disease related to survival function , not just the hazard ratio .
Since the hazard ratio does not give us direct time - to - event information , researchers have to report median endpoint times and calculate the median endpoint time ratio by dividing the control group median value by the treatment group median value .
While the median endpoint ratio is a relative speed measure , the hazard ratio is not .
The relationship between treatment effect and the hazard ratio is given as formula_9 .
A statistically important , but practically insignificant effect can produce a large hazard ratio , e.g. a treatment increasing the number of one - year survivors in a population from one in 10,000 to one in 1,000 has a hazard ratio of 10 .
It is unlikely that such a treatment would have had much impact on the median endpoint time ratio , which likely would have been close to unity , i.e. mortality was largely the same regardless of group membership and clinically insignificant .
By contrast , a treatment group in which 50 % of infections are resolved after one week ( versus 25 % in the control ) yields a hazard ratio of two .
If it takes ten weeks for all cases in the treatment group and half of cases in the control group to resolve , the ten - week hazard ratio remains at two , but the median endpoint time ratio is ten , a clinically significant difference .
