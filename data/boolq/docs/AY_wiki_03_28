MADRIGAL
A madrigal is a secular vocal music composition of the Renaissance and early Baroque eras .
Traditionally , polyphonic madrigals are unaccompanied ; the number of voices varies from two to eight , and most frequently from three to six .
It is quite distinct from the Italian Trecento madrigal of the late 13th and 14th centuries , with which it shares only the name .
Madrigals originated in Italy during the 1520s .
Unlike many strophic forms of the time , most madrigals were through - composed .
In the madrigal , the composer attempted to express the emotion contained in each line , and sometimes individual words , of a celebrated poem .
The madrigal originated in part from the frottola , in part from the resurgence in interest in vernacular Italian poetry , and also from the influence of the French chanson and polyphonic style of the motet as written by the Franco - Flemish composers who had naturalized in Italy during the period .
A frottola generally would consist of music set to stanzas of text , while madrigals were through - composed .
However , some of the same poems were used for both frottola and madrigals .
The poetry of Petrarch in particular shows up in a wide variety of genres .
In Italy , the madrigal was the most important secular form of music of its time .
The madrigal reached its formal and historical zenith by the second half of the 16th century .
English and German composers , too , took up the madrigal in its heyday .
After the 1630s , the madrigal began to merge with the cantata and the dialogue .
With the rise of opera in the early 17th century , the aria gradually displaced the madrigal .
HISTORY ORIGINS AND EARLY MADRIGALS Section::::History .
Section::::Origins and early madrigals .
In the early 16th century , several humanistic trends converged which allowed the madrigal to form .
First , there was a reawakened interest in use of Italian as a vernacular language .
Poet and literary theorist Pietro Bembo edited an edition of Petrarch , the great 14th - century poet , in 1501 , and later published his theories on how contemporary poets could attain excellence by imitating Petrarch , and by being carefully attentive to the exact sounds of words , as well as their positioning within lines .
The poetic form of the madrigal , which consisted of an irregular number of lines of usually 7 or 11 syllables , without repetition , and usually on a serious topic , came into being as a result of Bembo 's influence .
Second , Italy had long been a destination for the oltremontani ( " those from beyond the Alps " ) , superbly - trained composers of the Franco - Flemish school , who were attracted by the culture as well as the employment opportunities at the aristocratic courts and ecclesiastical institutions – Italy was , after all , the center of the Roman Catholic Church , the single most important cultural institution in Europe .
These composers had mastered a serious polyphonic style suitable for setting sacred music , and also were familiar with the secular music of their homelands , music such as the chanson , which differed considerably from the lighter Italian secular styles of the late 15th and very early 16th centuries .
Third , printed secular music had become widely available in Italy due to the recent invention of moveable type and the printing press .
The music being written and sung , principally the frottola but also the ballata , canzonetta , and mascherata , was light , and typically used verses of relatively low literary quality .
These popular music styles used repetition and soprano - dominated chordal textures , styles considerably more simple than those used by most of the resident composers of the Franco - Flemish school .
Literary tastes were changing , and the more serious verse of Bembo and his school needed a means of musical expression more flexible and open than was available in the frottola and its related forms .
The first madrigals were written in Florence , either by native Florentines or by Franco - Flemish musicians in the employment of the Medici family .
The madrigal did not replace the frottola right away ; during the transitional decade of the 1520s , both frottole and madrigals ( though not yet in name ) were written and published .
The earliest madrigals were probably those by Bernardo Pisano , in his 1520 Musica di messer Bernardo Pisano sopra le canzone del Petrarcha , which was also the first secular music collection ever printed containing only the works of a single composer .
While none of the pieces in the collection use the name " madrigal " , some of the compositions are settings of Petrarch , and the music carefully observes word placement and accent , and even contains word - painting , a feature which was to become characteristic of the later madrigal .
The first book of madrigals labeled as such was the Madrigali de diversi musici : libro primo de la Serena of Philippe Verdelot , published in 1530 in Rome .
Verdelot , a French composer , had written the pieces in the late 1520s , while he lived in Florence .
He included music by both Sebastiano and Costanzo Festa , as well as Maistre Jhan of Ferrara , in addition to his own music .
In 1533 and 1534 he published two books of four voice madrigals in Venice ; these were to become extremely popular , so much so that their 1540 reprint was one of the most widely printed and distributed music books of the first half of the 16th century .
They sold so well that Adrian Willaert made arrangements of some of these works for single voice and lute in 1536 .
Verdelot published madrigals for five and six voices as well , with the collection for six voices appearing in 1541 .
Particularly popular was the first collection of madrigals by Jacques Arcadelt .
Originally published in Venice , in 1539 , it was reprinted throughout Europe for many years after , becoming the most often reprinted madrigal book of the entire era .
Stylistically , the music in both Arcadelt 's and Verdelot 's books was more akin to the French chanson than either the Italian frottola or the sacred music of the time , such as the motet .
This may be unsurprising considering that the native language of both Arcadelt and Verdelot was French , and both had written chansons themselves when in their homeland ; however , they were carefully attentive to text setting , in keeping with the ideas of Bembo , and they through - composed the music , writing new music for each line of text , rather than using the refrain and verse constructions that were common in French secular music .
MID-16TH CENTURY Section::::Mid-16th century .
While the madrigal was born in Florence and Rome , by mid-16th century the centers of musical activity had moved to Venice and other cities .
The mercenaries of Charles V sacked Rome in 1527 , and a period of related political turmoil in Florence , culminating in the Siege of Florence ( 1529–30 ) , in which Verdelot himself may have perished , reduced that city 's significance as a musical center .
In addition , Venice was Europe 's center of music publishing ; the grand Basilica of St. Mark 's was just beginning the period in which it attracted musicians from all over Europe ; and Pietro Bembo himself had returned to Venice in 1529 .
Adrian Willaert and his associates at St. Mark 's – younger men such as Girolamo Parabosco , Jacques Buus , Baldassare Donato , Perissone Cambio , and Cipriano de Rore – were the primary representatives of madrigal composition at mid - century .
Willaert preferred more complex textures to Arcadelt and Verdelot ; often his madrigals were similar to motets , with their polyphonic language , although he varied texture between homophonic and polyphonic passages as necessary to highlight the text .
For verse he used Petrarch in preference to Petrarch 's 16th - century imitators ; many of his madrigals set Petrarch 's sonnets .
Cipriano de Rore was the most influential of the mid - century madrigalists after Willaert .
While Willaert was restrained and subtle in his text setting , striving more for homogeneity than sharp contrast , Rore was one to experiment .
He used extravagant rhetorical gestures , including word - painting and unusual chromatic relationships , a trend encouraged by visionary music theorist Nicola Vicentino .
It was from Rore 's musical language that " madrigalisms " , so distinctive of the genre , first came about ; and it was also with Rore that five - voice texture became the standard .
FROM THE 1550S TO THE 1570S Section::::From the 1550s to the 1570s .
The later history of the madrigal begins with Rore .
All of the different trends in madrigal composition , which by the early 17th century had diverged into many different forms , are present in embryonic form in Rore 's enormously influential output .
Many thousands of madrigals were written in Italy in the 1550s ; the entire repertoire has yet to be studied exhaustively .
Some famous names of the period , besides Rore , are Palestrina , who wrote some secular music early in his career ; the young Orlande de Lassus , who wrote many well - known examples , including the highly experimental and chromatic Prophetiae Sibyllarum , and who , on moving to Munich in 1556 , began the history of madrigal composition outside of Italy ; and Philippe de Monte , the most prolific of all madrigal composers , whose first publication dates from 1554 .
In style , the madrigals of the 1550s varied from the conservative and elegant style of Palestrina and some of the others working in Rome , to the highly chromatic and expressive work by Lassus , Rore , and others working in the cities of northern Italy .
Late in the 16th century , while " classic " madrigals continued to be written throughout Italy , different styles of madrigal composition developed somewhat independently in different geographic areas .
In Venice , composers such as Andrea Gabrieli continued to write madrigals in the classic tradition , but with the bright , open , polyphonic textures for which he was famous in his motets and other works .
At the court of Ferrara , the presence of three uniquely gifted female singers – the concerto delle donne – attracted a group of composers who wrote highly ornamented madrigals , often with instrumental accompaniment , to be performed by members of this group .
These composers included Luzzasco Luzzaschi , Giaches de Wert , and Lodovico Agostini , but the fame of the group was so widespread that many composers visited Ferrara both to hear and write for them , and in some cases founded similar groups of their own in other cities ( for example , the Medici attempted to imitate the group in Florence , and had Alessandro Striggio write madrigals in a style like Luzzaschi 's ) .
Rome , the ostensibly conservative center of the Roman Catholic Church , was itself the home of one of the most famous madrigal composers of the era , Luca Marenzio .
Marenzio came closest to unifying all the different stylistic currents of the time , writing madrigals which attempted to capture every nuance of emotion in the poems using every musical means then available .
Marenzio wrote over 400 madrigals during his short life .
Yet another trend in madrigal composition after mid - century was the re - incorporation of lighter elements into the form , which had been predominantly a serious genre since its inception .
Where verse by Petrarch had been the standard , and themes of love and longing and death had been typical , by the 1560s composers had begun bringing back elements of some lighter Italian forms , such as the villanella , with their dancelike rhythms and verses on carefree subjects .
Some of the composers who wrote in this manner included Marc'Antonio Ingegneri , the teacher of Monteverdi , Andrea Gabrieli , and Giovanni Ferretti .
The canzonetta was a specific offshoot of the madrigal in this vein .
Especially during the late 16th century , composers were ingenious in their use of so - called " madrigalisms " – passages in which the music assigned to a particular word expresses its meaning , for example , setting riso ( smile ) to a passage of quick , running notes which imitate laughter , or sospiro ( sigh ) to a note which falls to the note below .
This technique is also known as " word - painting . "
While it originated in secular music , it made its way into other vocal music of the period .
While this mannerism is a prominent feature of madrigals of the late 16th century , including both Italian and English , it encountered sharp criticism from some composers .
Thomas Campion , writing in the preface to his first book of lute songs 1601 , said of it : " ... where the nature of everie word is precisely expresst in the Note … such childish observing of words is altogether ridiculous . "
AT
THE END OF THE 16TH CENTURY Section::::At
the end of the 16th century .
The change in the social function of the madrigal at the end of the 16th century contributed to its development into new dramatic forms .
Since its invention , it had served two principal roles : as a pleasant private entertainment for small groups of skilled amateur musicians ; and as an adjunct to large ceremonial public performances .
The first use , the private one , was by far the most common throughout the life of the madrigal , and it was through these enthusiastic gatherings of amateurs that the madrigal acquired its fame .
However , in the last two decades of the century , virtuoso professional singers began to replace amateurs , and composers wrote music for them of greater dramatic force .
Not only was this music harder to sing , but the sentiments expressed tended to require soloists rather than equal members of an ensemble in order to be dramatically convincing .
Also during this period a division between performers and passive audiences – not the large audiences present at a public ceremonial spectacle , as seen earlier in the century , but relatively small , intimate gatherings , with performers and listeners , a situation recognizably modern – began to be seen , especially in such progressive cultural centers as Ferrara and Mantua .
Much of what was once expressed in a madrigal in 1590 , could twenty years later be expressed by an aria in the new form of opera ; however , the madrigal continued to live on into the 17th century , in several forms , including old - style madrigals for many voices ; a solo form with instrumental accompaniment ; and the concertato madrigal , of which Claudio Monteverdi was the most famous practitioner .
Naples was the home of the nobleman Carlo Gesualdo , who killed his wife and her lover in flagrante delicto and wrote some of the most extravagantly expressive and harmonically experimental music prior to the 19th century .
Gesualdo 's style followed directly from Luzzaschi 's , and he named the older composer as his mentor :
the two worked together at Ferrara in the early 1590s , giving Gesualdo ample opportunity to absorb the chromaticism and textural contrasts of the Ferrarese , including Luzzaschi and Alfonso Fontanelli .
Gesualdo published six books of madrigals during his lifetime , as well as some sacred music in madrigalian style ( for example the Tenebrae Responsories of 1611 ) .
Very few madrigalists followed Gesualdo down this path of mannerism and extreme chromaticism , although composers such as Antonio Cifra , Sigismondo d'India , and Domenico Mazzocchi selectively used some of his techniques .
Michelangelo Rossi , whose two books of unaccompanied madrigals ( written c. 1620s ) display a sustained use of extreme chromaticism , was perhaps Gesualdo 's most direct successor .
MONTEVERDI ; TRANSITION TO THE " CONCERTED " MADRIGAL Section::::Monteverdi ; transition to the " concerted " madrigal . Of all the composers of madrigals of the late 16th century , none was as central a figure as Claudio Monteverdi , who was often credited as the principal actor in the transition from Renaissance music to Baroque music .
In his long career , he wrote nine books of madrigals , which showed the transition from the late 16th - century polyphonic style to the monodic and concertato style , accompanied by basso continuo , of the early Baroque .
As expressive as Gesualdo , he avoided the extremes of chromaticism employed by that composer and instead focused on the dramatic possibilities inherent in the form .
His fifth and sixth books include not only polyphonic madrigals for equal voices in the manner of the late 16th century , but also madrigals with parts for solo voice accompanied by continuo ; additionally these works make use of unprepared dissonances and recitative - like passages , foreshadowing the eventual absorption of the solo madrigal into the aria .
These madrigals also show the influence of monody , developing at the same time :
Manfred Bukofzer called the development of the recitative - like ' stile rappresentativo ' around 1600 as " the most important turning point in the entire history of music . "
To Monteverdi , the words must be " the mistress of the harmony " , and he explained this doctrine in his preface to his Fifth Book of Madrigals with his coinage of the term seconda pratica , in response to the fierce criticism of Giovanni Artusi , who defended the polyphonic style of the 16th century with its controlled dissonance and equal voice parts , and attacked the " barbaric " new style .
Arnold /
Wakelin AFTER 1600
: THE " CONCERTED MADRIGAL " Section::::After 1600 : the " concerted madrigal " .
During the first decade of the 17th century the madrigal moved away from the old ideal of an a cappella vocal composition for equally balanced voices , into a piece for one or more voices with instrumental accompaniment .
The soprano and bass line became more important to the texture than the inner voices , if they existed at all as independent parts ; functional tonality began to develop ; composers treated dissonance more freely than before ; and dramatic contrasts between groupings of voices and instruments became increasingly common .
In the 17th century madrigal , two separate trends can be identified : the solo madrigal , which involved a solo voice with basso continuo , and madrigals for two or more voices , also with basso continuo .
In addition , some composers continued to write ensemble madrigals in the older style , especially in England .
While the harmonic and dramatic changes in the madrigal around 1600 may seem abrupt , the addition of instruments was not a new development .
Instrumental performance of madrigals had already been widespread for much of the 16th century , either in arrangements or in performances mixed with singers .
As madrigals had originally been largely designed for performance by groups of talented amateurs , without a passive audience , instruments were also commonly used to fill in for missing parts .
Instrumentation during the period was rarely specified ; indeed Monteverdi indicated in his fifth and sixth book of madrigals that the basso seguente , the instrumental bass part , was optional in the ensemble madrigals .
The most commonly used instruments for playing the bass line and filling in any inner parts , at this time , were the lute , theorbo ( chitarrone ) , and harpsichord .
One of the prominent composers of madrigals in the solo with continuo style , related to monody and descended directly from the experimental music of the Florentine Camerata , was Giulio Caccini , who published the first collection of solo madrigals with his Le nuove musiche in 1601/2 .
The point was anti - contrapuntal :
Caccini and the Camerata believed that the words needed to be heard above all else , and polyphonic , evenly balanced voices easily obscured intelligibility .
After Caccini , composers such as Marco da Gagliano , Sigismondo d'India , and Claudio Saracini published collections of their own ; while Caccini 's music was almost entirely diatonic , some of these later composers , particular d'India , wrote their solo madrigals in a more experimental chromatic idiom .
Monteverdi himself wrote only one solo madrigal , which he published in his Seventh Book of Madrigals in 1619 .
While it uses only one singing voice , it employs three separate groups of instruments – a considerable advance from the simple voice and basso continuo compositions of Caccini around 1600 .
Solo madrigals in the monodic style began to go out of fashion shortly before 1620 , to be replaced by the aria .
The last book of solo madrigals which did not contain any arias appeared in 1618 ; that was also the first year in which a group of arias was published which contained no madrigals .
After that date arias outnumbered madrigals , and both Saracini and d'India , previously prolific composers of solo madrigals , ceased publishing them in the early 1620s .
Two collections of the late 1630s serve as a summation of late madrigal practice .
Domenico Mazzocchi 's 1638 book splits madrigals into continuo and ensemble works specifically intended to be performed a cappella ; Mazzocchi 's instructions are precise , and he even includes , for the first time in any printed music collection , symbols for crescendo and decrescendo .
However , these madrigals were not intended for performance so much as study , and as such show that the form was being viewed in retrospect .
Monteverdi 's Book Eight , of the same year , contains some of the most famous madrigals of the entire epoch , including the enormous Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda , a dramatic composition much like a secular oratorio .
Among other innovations in this work is the stile concitato – the " agitated style " , which uses , among other things , string tremolo .
The pieces in Monteverdi 's Book Eight , written over at least two decades , show just about every development in the madrigal since 1600 .
Eventually the madrigal vanished as an independent form .
The solo madrigal was supplanted by the aria and solo cantata ; the ensemble madrigal by the cantata and dialogue .
By 1640 few madrigals were still being published , and opera had become the predominant dramatic musical form .
ENGLISH MADRIGAL SCHOOL Section::::English madrigal school .
In England , the madrigal became hugely popular after the publication of Nicholas Yonge 's Musica Transalpina in 1588 , a collection of Italian madrigals fitted with English translations ; this publication initiated an entire school of madrigal composition in England .
The unaccompanied madrigal survived longer in England than in the rest of Europe .
There , composers continued to produce works in the late-16th century style of the genre after the form had gone out of fashion on the Continent .
ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE
Section::::Elsewhere in Europe .
Madrigals influenced secular music in many other parts of Europe , and in some areas composers wrote actual madrigals , either in Italian or in their own languages .
The amount of influence was roughly inversely proportional to the strength of the local secular musical tradition : for example France , which had the robust and sophisticated form of the chanson during the 16th century , never adopted the madrigal – they did not need it .
However some French composers , especially those who had been to Italy , used madrigalian techniques in their writing .
These composers included cosmopolitan figures such as Orlande de Lassus , who wrote in at least four languages , as well as Frenchmen such as Claude Le Jeune .
The Netherlands was a major center of music publishing , and since Italian madrigals were easily available from publishing houses , some native composers wrote works either in influence or imitation .
Cornelis Verdonck , Hubert Waelrant , and Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck all composed madrigals in Italian .
Germany was the home of several prolific composers of madrigals , including Lassus ( in Munich ) and Philippe de Monte ( Vienna ) , the most prolific madrigal composer of all .
Many Germans had gone south to study in Italy , particularly with the Venetians ; Hans Leo Hassler studied with Andrea Gabrieli , and Heinrich Schütz with Monteverdi .
Each brought back to Germany what they learned , and wrote madrigals or madrigalian pieces both in Italian and German .
Musicians from the courts of Denmark and Poland also studied the Italian style either in their home countries or in Italy ; Marenzio himself had worked in Poland near the end of his life .
Caspar Ziegler from the University of Wittenberg , who collaborated with Schütz , wrote a treatise Von den Madrigalen , published in 1653 .
AFTER THE 17TH CENTURY Section::::After the 17th century .
In early 18th century England , singing of madrigals was revived by catch and glee clubs , and later by the formation of institutions such as the Madrigal Society in London formed in 1741 .
As a result of the printing and singing of madrigals , particularly English ones , the madrigal became the best - known form of Renaissance secular music in England in the 19th century , even before the rediscovery of works by composers such as Palestrina .
Choral groups continue to sing madrigals to the present day .
The Philippine Madrigal Singers , which specializes in this genre , is an internationally awarded choir .
The King 's Singers is an award - winning all - male madrigal group performing internationally .
It specializes both in traditional madrigal pieces as well as contemporary music .
The Elizabethan Madrigal Singers , a madrigal choir based in Aberystwyth , Wales , is the university chamber choir for Aberystwyth University , as well as being the oldest society at the university .
In the United States madrigal choirs are particularly popular with high school and college groups , and often sing in the context of a madrigal dinner .
This may also include a play , Renaissance costumes , and instrumental chamber music .
The focus is generally on the repertoire of the English Madrigal School .
The first composer trying to revive the art of madrigal singing in the 20th century , was Paul Hindemith .
He wrote 12 pieces for 5 voices on poems by Josef Weinheber .
