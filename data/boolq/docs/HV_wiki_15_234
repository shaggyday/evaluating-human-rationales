Section::::Interference with business practices .
In October 2012 , A&E Network and the History Channel , along with Harrison and the rest of the show 's cast , were sued in Clark County District Court in Las Vegas for interference with business practices by Wayne F. Jefferies , a Las Vegas promoter and the Harrisons ' manager , who represented them and " Chumlee " Russell in their television business dealings .
Jefferies , who managed and operated the Las Vegas world cuisine restaurant Seven in 2001 , and who , as an event promoter , put up to $ 75,000 in support of the 2005 and 2006 Las Vegas Red , White and Boom Independence Day event , was instrumental in helping to launch the series .
Jefferies stated that after the show premiered , his influence in the show was increasingly reduced , and that he was ultimately fired and left without his promised share of fees and merchandising royalties from the series , purportedly due to network executives after a January 2012 report on TMZ that indicated that the Pawn Stars cast were taken aback by the History Channel 's launch of the spinoff Cajun Pawn Stars , of which the cast had been unaware .
