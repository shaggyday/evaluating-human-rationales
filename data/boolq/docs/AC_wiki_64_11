LITRE
The litre ( international spelling ) or liter ( American spelling ) ( symbols L or l ) is an SI accepted metric system unit of volume equal to 1 cubic decimetre ( dm ) , 1,000 cubic centimetres ( cm ) or 1/1,000 cubic metre .
A cubic decimetre ( or litre ) occupies a volume of 10 cm×10 cm×10 cm ( see figure ) and is thus equal to one - thousandth of a cubic metre .
The original French metric system used the litre as a base unit .
The word litre is derived from an older French unit , the litron , whose name came from Greek — where it was a unit of weight , not volume — via Latin , and which equalled approximately 0.831 litres .
The litre was also used in several subsequent versions of the metric system and is accepted for use with the SI , although not an SI unit — the SI unit of volume is the cubic metre ( m ) .
The spelling used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures is " litre " , a spelling which is shared by almost all English - speaking countries .
The spelling " liter " is predominantly used in American English .
One litre of liquid water has a mass of almost exactly one kilogram , because the kilogram was originally defined in 1795 as the mass of one cubic decimetre of water at the temperature of melting ice .
Subsequent redefinitions of the metre and kilogram mean that this relationship is no longer exact .
DEFINITION Section::::Definition .
A litre is defined as a special name for a cubic decimetre or 10 centimetres × 10 centimetres × 10 centimetres , ( 1 L ≡ 1 dm ≡ 1000 cm ) .
Hence 1 L ≡ 0.001 m ≡ 1000 cm , and 1 m ( i.e. a cubic metre , which is the SI unit for volume ) is exactly 1000 L. From 1901 to 1964 , the litre was defined as the volume of one kilogram of pure water at maximum density and standard pressure .
The kilogram was in turn specified as the mass of a platinum / iridium cylinder held at Sèvres in France and was intended to be of the same mass as the 1 litre of water referred to above .
It was subsequently discovered that the cylinder was around 28 parts per million too large and thus , during this time , a litre was about 1.000028 dm .
Additionally , the mass - volume relationship of water ( as with any fluid ) depends on temperature , pressure , purity and isotopic uniformity .
In 1964 , the definition relating the litre to mass was abandoned in favour of the current one .
Although the litre is not an SI unit , it is accepted by the CGPM ( the standards body that defines the SI ) for use with the SI .
CGPM defines the litre and its acceptable symbols .
A litre is equal in volume to the millistere , an obsolete non - SI metric unit customarily used for dry measure .
EXPLANATION Section::::Explanation .
Litres are most commonly used for items ( such as fluids and solids that can be poured ) , which are measured by the capacity or size of their container , whereas cubic metres ( and derived units ) are most commonly used for items measured either by their dimensions or their displacements .
The litre is often also used in some calculated measurements , such as density ( kg / L ) , allowing an easy comparison with the density of water .
One litre of water has a mass of almost exactly one kilogram when measured at its maximal density , which occurs at about 4 ° C .
Similarly : one millilitre ( 1 mL ) of water has a mass of about 1 g ; 1,000 litres of water has a mass of about 1,000 kg ( 1 tonne ) .
This relationship holds because the gram was originally defined as the mass of 1 mL of water ; however , this definition was abandoned in 1799 because the density of water changes with temperature and , very slightly , with pressure .
It is now known that the density of water also depends on the isotopic ratios of the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in a particular sample .
Modern measurements of Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water , which is pure distilled water with an isotopic composition representative of the average of the world 's oceans , show it has a density of at its point of maximum density ( 3.984 ° C ) under one standard atmosphere ( 760 Torr , 101.325 kPa ) of pressure .
SI PREFIXES APPLIED TO THE LITRE Section::::SI prefixes applied to the litre .
The litre , though not an official SI unit , may be used with SI prefixes .
The most commonly used derived unit is the millilitre , defined as one - thousandth of a litre , and also often referred to by the SI derived unit name " cubic centimetre " .
It is a commonly used measure , especially in medicine , cooking and automotive engineering .
Other units may be found in the table below , where the more often used terms are in bold .
However , some authorities advise against some of them ; for example , in the United States , NIST advocates using the millilitre or litre instead of the centilitre . !

One litre is slightly more than one US liquid quart and slightly less than one imperial quart or one US dry quart .
A mnemonic for its volume relative to the imperial pint is ' a litre of water is a pint and three quarters ' .
A litre is the volume of a cube with sides of 10 cm , which is slightly less than a cube of sides 4 inches ( or one - third of a foot ) .
One cubic foot would contain exactly 27 such cubes ( four inches on each side ) , making one cubic foot approximately equal to 27 litres .
One cubic foot has an exact volume of 28.316846592 litres , which is within 5 % of the 27-litre approximation .
A litre of liquid water has a mass almost exactly equal to one kilogram .
An early definition of the kilogram was set as the mass of one litre of water .
Because volume changes with temperature and pressure , and pressure uses units of mass , the definition of a kilogram was changed .
At standard pressure , one litre of water has a mass of 0.999975 kg at , and 0.997 kg at .
SYMBOL Section::::Symbol .
Originally , the only symbol for the litre was l ( lowercase letter L ) , following the SI convention that only those unit symbols that abbreviate the name of a person start with a capital letter .
In many English - speaking countries , however , the most common shape of a handwritten Arabic digit 1 is just a vertical stroke ; that is , it lacks the upstroke added in many other cultures .
Therefore , the digit " 1 " may easily be confused with the letter " l " .
Further , on some typewriters , particularly older ones , the unshifted L key had to be used to type the numeral 1 .
Even in some computer typefaces , the two characters are barely distinguishable .
This caused some concern , especially in the medical community .
As a result , L ( uppercase letter L ) was adopted as an alternative symbol for litre in 1979 .
The United States National Institute of Standards and Technology now recommends the use of the uppercase letter L , a practice that is also widely followed in Canada and Australia .
In these countries , the symbol L is also used with prefixes , as in mL and μL , instead of the traditional ml and μl used in Europe .
In the UK and Ireland as well as the rest of Europe , lowercase l is used with prefixes , though whole litres are often written in full ( so , " 750 ml " on a wine bottle , but often " 1 litre " on a juice carton ) .
In 1990 , the CIPM stated that it was too early to choose a single symbol for the litre .
Prior to 1979 , the symbol ( script small l , U+2113 ) , came into common use in some countries ; for example , it was recommended by South African Bureau of Standards publication M33 and Canada in the 1970s .
This symbol can still be encountered occasionally in some English - speaking and European countries like Germany , and its use is ubiquitous in Japan and South Korea .
Fonts covering the CJK characters usually include not only the script small but also four precomposed characters :
㎕ , ㎖ , ㎗ and ㎘
( U+3395 to U+3398 ) for the microlitre , millilitre , decilitre and kilolitre .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The first name of the litre was " cadil " ; standards are shown at the Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris .
The litre was introduced in France in 1795 as one of the new " republican units of measurement " and defined as one cubic decimetre .
One litre of liquid water has a mass of almost exactly one kilogram , due to the gram being defined in 1795 as one cubic centimetre of water at the temperature of melting ice .
The original decimetre length was 44.344 lignes , which was revised in 1798 to 44.3296 lignes .
This made the original litre of today 's cubic decimetre .
It was against this litre that the kilogram was constructed .
In 1879 , the CIPM adopted the definition of the litre , with the symbol l ( lowercase letter L ) .
In 1901 , at the 3rd CGPM conference , the litre was redefined as the space occupied by 1 kg of pure water at the temperature of its maximum density ( 3.98 ° C ) under a pressure of 1 atm .
This made the litre equal to about ( earlier reference works usually put it at ) .
In 1964 , at the 12th CGPM conference , the original definition was reverted to , and thus the litre was once again defined in exact relation to the metre , as another name for the cubic decimetre , that is , exactly 1 dm .
In 1979 , at the 16th CGPM conference , the alternative symbol L ( uppercase letter L ) was adopted .
It also expressed a preference that in the future only one of these two symbols should be retained , but in 1990 said it was still too early to do so .
COLLOQUIAL AND PRACTICAL USAGE Section::::Colloquial and practical usage .
In spoken English , the symbol " mL " ( for millilitre ) is sometimes pronounced as " mil " , which is potentially confusing as this could also be interpreted as : * millimetre , a unit of length equal to one - thousandth of a metre * * thousandth of an inch
* * mil , a Scandinavian unit of length equal to 10 kilometres
*
* angular mil , unit of angular measurement * Generally , these various meanings do not create confusion because the context is usually sufficient — one being a volume , the others linear or angular measurement .
The abbreviation cc ( for cubic centimetre , equal to a millilitre or mL ) is a unit of the cgs system , that preceded the MKS system , that later evolved into the SI system .
The abbreviation cc is still commonly used in many fields including medical dosage and sizing for small combustion engine displacement , such as those used in motorcycles .
The microlitre ( μL ) has been known in the past as the lambda ( λ ) , but this usage is now discouraged .
In the medical field the microlitre is sometimes abbreviated as mcL on test results .
In the SI system , use of prefixes for powers of 1,000 is preferred and all other multiples discouraged .
However , in countries where the metric system was established well before the adoption of the SI standard other multiples were already established , their use remains common .
In particular , use of the centi ( 10 ) , deci ( 10 ) , deca ( 10 ) and hecto ( 10 ) prefixes are still common .
For example , in many European countries , the hectolitre is the typical unit for production and export volumes of beverages ( milk , beer , soft drinks , wine , etc . )
and for measuring the size of the catch and quotas for fishing boats ; decilitres are common in Switzerland and Scandinavia and sometimes found in cookbooks ; centilitres indicate the capacity of drinking glasses and of small bottles .
In colloquial Dutch in Belgium , a " vijfentwintiger " and a " drieëndertiger " ( literally " twenty - fiver " and " thirty - threer " ) are the common beer glasses , the corresponding bottles mention 25 cL or 33 cL.
Bottles may also be 75 cL or half size at 37.5 cL for ' artisanal ' brews or 70 cL for wines or spirits .
Cans come in 25 cL , 33 cL and 50 cL.
In countries where the metric system was adopted as the official measuring system after the SI standard was established , common usage more closely follow contemporary SI conventions .
For example , in Canada , Australia , and New Zealand , consumer beverages are labelled almost exclusively using litres and millilitres .
Hectolitres sometimes appear in industry , but centilitres and decilitres are rarely , if ever , used .
An exception is in pathology , where for instance blood lead level may be measured in micrograms per decilitre .
Larger volumes are usually given in cubic metres ( equivalent to 1 kL ) , or thousands or millions of cubic metres .
Although kilolitres , megalitres , and gigalitres are commonly used for measuring water consumption , reservoir capacities and river flows , for larger volumes of fluids , such as annual consumption of tap water , lorry ( truck ) tanks , or swimming pools , the cubic metre is the general unit .
It is also generally for all volumes of a non - liquid nature .
