UNCLE Uncle ( from the diminutive of avus " grandfather " ) is a male family relationship or kinship within an extended or immediate family .
An uncle is the brother , half - brother , step - brother , or brother - in - law of one 's parent , or the husband of one 's aunt or uncle .
The specific terms for the last three respectively are half - uncle , stepuncle and uncle - in - law which can refer also to the husband of one 's aunt .
A biological uncle is a second degree male relative and shares 25 % genetic overlap .
However people who are not a biological uncle , are sometimes affectionately called as an uncle , as a title of admiration and respect .
A woman with the equivalent relationship of an uncle is an aunt .
The reciprocal relationship to both of these is that of a nephew or niece .
A great - uncle ( sometimes written as great uncle , grand - uncle or granduncle ) is the brother or brother - in - law of one 's grandparent .
A male cousin of one 's parent is often addressed as " uncle " instead of " cousin " .
CULTURAL VARIATIONS
Section::::Cultural variations .
In some cultures and families , children may refer to the cousins of their parents as " aunt " or " uncle " .
It is also a title of respect for elders ( for example older cousins , neighbors , acquaintances , close family friends , and even sometimes total strangers ) .
Using the term in this way is a form of fictive kinship .
ALBANIAN , SLAVIC AND PERSIAN Section::::Albanian , Slavic and Persian .
In some cultures , like Albanian , Slavic , or Persian , no single inclusive term describing both a person 's kinship to their parental male sibling or parental male in - law exists .
Instead , there are specific terms describing a person 's kinship to their mother 's brother ( " dajë " in Albanian language , " daiyee " in Persian , " wuj " ( diminutive : " wujek " ) in Polish ) or a person 's kinship to their father 's brother ( " xhajë " in Albanian , " amou " in Persian , " stryj " ( diminutive : " stryjek " ) in Polish ) .
An analogous differentiation exists using separate terms to describe a person 's kinship to their mother 's female sibling , ( " teze " in Albanian , " khaleh " in Persian , " ciotka " ( diminutive : " ciocia " ) in Polish ) , and a person 's kinship to their father 's female sibling , ( " hallë " in Albanian , " ammeh " in Persian , " stryjna " ( diminutive : " stryjenka " ) in Polish ) .
Furthermore , in Persian culture the terms used to describe a person 's kinship to their maternal or paternal in - laws bear clear and unambiguous descriptions of that relationship , differentiating the parental in - laws from blood - relatives .
For example , there is a specific term describing a person 's kinship to the spouse of their paternal uncle ( i.e. " zan - amou " , literally ' wife - of- ' amou ) .
This clarifies that kinship is to the spouse of the person 's paternal male sibling , as opposed to a blood - relationship . IRISH Section::::Irish .
Uncles and aunts are considered important in modern Irish culture and are usually chosen to be godfather or godmother of children during Catholic baptism .
A young Irish person might seek the counsel of their favourite aunt or uncle before making an important decision , and the opinion of the respective aunt or uncle is treated seriously .
