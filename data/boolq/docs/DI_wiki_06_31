ARTIFICIAL URINARY BLADDER
The two main methods for replacing bladder function involve either redirecting urine flow or replacing the bladder in situ .
Replacement can be done with an artificial urinary bladder , an artificial organ .
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Development .
On January 30 , 1999 , scientists announced that a lab - grown bladder had been successfully transplanted into dogs .
These artificial bladders worked well for almost a year in the dogs .
In 2000 , a new procedure for creating artificial bladders for humans was developed .
This procedure is called an orthotopic neobladder procedure .
This procedure involves shaping a part ( usually 35 to 40 inches ) of a patient 's small intestine to form a new bladder ; however , these bladders made of intestinal tissues produced unpleasant side - effects .
In 2006 , the first publication of experimental transplantation of bioengineered bladders appeared in The Lancet .
The trial involved seven people with spina bifida between the ages of four and nineteen who had been followed for up to five years after surgery to determine long - term effects .
The bladders were prepared and the trial run by a team of biologists at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine and Boston Children 's Hospital led by Professor Anthony Atala .
BENEFITS Section::::Benefits .
Bioengineered organs which rely on a patient 's own cells , autologous constructs , are not subject to transplant rejection , unlike transplants from human or animal donors .
The current standard for repairing a damaged urinary bladder involves partial or complete replacement using tissue from the small intestine .
