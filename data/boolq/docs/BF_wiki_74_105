HISTORY Section::::History .
Brothers Dr. John Harvey and Will Keith Kellogg founded a health food company , the Battle Creek Sanitarium Health Food Company in 1898 .
This company produced foodstuffs for current and former patients at Dr. J. H. Kellogg 's Battle Creek Sanitarium .
The company later became known as the Battle Creek Sanitarium Food Company in 1901 .
During this time , the company produced and marketed health foods such as corn flakes , Granola and Caramel Cereal Coffee .
The company merged with the Sanitas Nut Food Company ( founded in 1899 by Dr. J. H. Kellogg ) to become the Kellogg Food Company in July 1908 , and sold nut butters and meat substitutes , and it was then that the company 's products all began to be sold under the trade name , " Kellogg 's " .
At this time , Dr. J. H. Kellogg owned all but 2 of its 15,000 shares of stock .
In 1921 , it changed its name back to Battle Creek Food Company .
However , Dr. John Harvey forbade his brother Will from distributing cereal beyond his patients .
As a result , the brothers fell out , and W. K. launched the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company on February 19 , 1906 .
Convincing his brother to relinquish Sanitas 's rights to the product , Will 's company produced and marketed the hugely successful Kellogg 's Toasted Corn Flakes and was renamed the Kellogg Toasted Corn Flake Company in 1909 , taking on the current name of the Kellogg Company in 1922 .
In 1930 , the Kellogg Company announced that most of its factories would shift towards 30-hour work weeks , from the usual 40 .
W.K. Kellogg stated that he did this so that an additional shift of workers would be employed in an effort to support people through the depression era .
This practice remained until World War II , and continued briefly after the war , although some departments and factories remained locked into 30-hour work weeks until 1980 .
From 1968 to 1970 , the slogan " Kellogg 's puts more into your morning " was used on Saturday morning tv shows .
From 1969 to 1977 , Kellogg 's acquired various small businesses including Salada Foods , Fearn International , Mrs. Smith 's Pies , Eggo , and Pure Packed Foods ; however , it was later criticized for not diversifying further like General Mills and Quaker Oats were .
After underspending its competition in marketing and product development , Kellogg 's U.S. market share hit a low 36.7 % in 1983 .
A prominent Wall Street analyst called it " a fine company that 's past its prime " and the cereal market was being regarded as " mature " .
Such comments stimulated Kellogg chairman William E. LaMothe to improve , which primarily involved approaching the demographic of 80 million baby boomers rather than marketing children - oriented cereals .
In emphasizing cereal 's convenience and nutritional value , Kellogg 's helped persuade U.S. consumers age 25 to 49 to eat 26 % more cereal than people of that age ate five years prior .
The U.S. ready - to - eat cereal market , worth $ 3.7 billion at retail in 1983 , totaled $ 5.4 billion by 1988 and had expanded three times as fast as the average grocery category .
Kellogg 's also introduced new products including Crispix , Raisin Squares , and Nutri - Grain Biscuits and reached out internationally with Just Right aimed at Australians and Genmai Flakes for Japan .
During this time , the company maintained success over its top competitors : General Mills , which largely marketed children 's cereals , and Post , which had difficulty in the adult cereal market .
In March 2001 , Kellogg 's made its largest acquisition , the Keebler Company .
Over the years , it has also gone on to acquire Morningstar Farms and Kashi divisions or subsidiaries .
Kellogg 's also owns the Bear Naked , Natural Touch , Cheez - It , Murray , Austin cookies and crackers , Famous Amos , Gardenburger ( acquired 2007 ) , and Plantation brands .
Presently , Kellogg 's is a member of the World Cocoa Foundation .
In 2012 , Kellogg 's became the world 's second - largest snack food company ( after PepsiCo ) by acquiring the potato crisps brand Pringles from Procter & Gamble for $ 2.7 billion in a cash deal .
In 2017 , Kellogg 's acquired Chicago - based food company Rxbar for $ 600 million .
Earlier that year , Kellogg 's also opened new corporate office space in Chicago 's Merchandise Mart for its global growth and IT departments .
In the UK , Kellogg 's also released the W. K. Kellogg brand of organic , vegan and plant - based cereals ( such as granolas , organic wholegrain wheat , and " super grains " ) with no added sugars .
In 2018 , Kellogg decided to cease their operations in Venezuela due to the economic crisis the country is facing .

MARKETING Section::::Marketing .
Various methods have been used in the company 's history to promote the company and its brands .
Foremost among these is the design of the Kellogg 's logo by Ferris Crane under the art direction of famed type guru Y. Ames .
Another was the well - remembered jingle " K E double - L , O double - good , Kellogg 's best to you ! "
With the rising popularity of patent medicine in early 20th century advertising , The Kellogg Company of Canada published a book named A New Way of Living that showed readers " how to achieve a new way of living ; how to preserve vitality ; how to maintain enthusiasm and energy ; how to get the most out of life because of a physical ability to enjoy it .
" It touted the All - Bran cereal as the secret to leading " normal " lives free of constipation .
Kellogg 's was a major sponsor throughout the run of the hit CBS panel
show What 's My Line ?
It and its associated products Frosted Flakes and Rice Krispies were also major sponsors for the PBS Kids children 's animated series Dragon Tales .

CHILDREN 'S PREMIUMS Section::::Children 's premiums .
Kellogg 's Corn Flakes had the first cereal premium with The Funny Jungleland Moving Pictures Book .
The book was originally available as a prize that was given to the customer in the store with the purchase of two packages of the cereal .
But in 1909 , Kellogg 's changed the book giveaway to a premium mail - in offer for the cost of a dime .
Over 2.5 million copies of the book were distributed in different editions over a period of 23 years .
CEREAL BOX PRIZES Section::::Cereal box prizes .
In 1945 , Kellogg 's inserted a prize in the form of pin - back buttons into each box of Pep cereal .

There were five series of comic characters and 18 different buttons in each set , with a total of 90 in the collection .

It played in a similar fashion as Donkey Kong Country ; users could play as Tony the Tiger , Coco the Monkey , or Snap , Crackle , and Pop .
Kellogg 's has also released " Talking " games .
The two current versions are Talking Tony and Talking Sam .
In these games , a microphone is used to play games and create voice commands for their computers .
In Talking Tony , Tony the Tiger , one of Kellogg 's most famous mascots , would be the main and only character in the game .
In Talking Sam , Toucan Sam , another famous mascot , would be in the game , instead .
Some [ toy cars ] have the Kellogg 's logo on them , and occasionally their mascots .
There was also a Talking Snap Crackle and Pop software .

In 2017 , the company announced its marketing campaign for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games featuring American athletes Nathan Chen , Kelly Clark , Meghan Duggan and Mike Schultz .
CONTROVERSIES
QUESTIONABLE NUTRITIONAL VALUE Section::::Controversies .
Section::::Questionable nutritional value .
Some of Kellogg 's marketing has been questioned in the press , prompted by an increase in consumer awareness of the mismatch between the marketing messages and the products themselves .
Food bloggers are also questioning the marketing methods used by cereal manufacturing companies such as Kellogg 's , due to their high sugar content and use of ingredients such as high - fructose corn syrup .
2010
CEREAL RECALL Section::::2010 cereal recall .
On June 25 , the company voluntarily began to recall about 28 million boxes of Apple Jacks , Corn Pops , Froot Loops and Honey Smacks because of an unusual smell and flavor from the packages ' liners that could make people ill .
Kellogg 's said about 20 people complained about the cereals , including five who reported nausea and vomiting .
Consumers reported the cereal smelled or tasted waxy or like metal or soap .
Company spokeswoman J. Adaire Putnam said some described it as tasting stale .
However , no serious health problems had been reported .
The suspected chemical that caused the illnesses was 2-methylnaphthalene , used in the cereal packaging process .
Little is known about 2-methylnaphthalene 's impact on human health as the Food and Drug Administration has no scientific data on its impact on humans , and the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) also does not have health and safety data .
This is despite the EPA having sought information on it from the chemical industry for 16 years .
2-Methylnaphthalene is a component of crude oil and is " structurally related to naphthalene , an ingredient in mothballs and toilet - deodorant blocks " that the EPA considers a possible human carcinogen .
Kellogg 's offered consumers refunds in the meantime .
Only products with the letters " KN " following the use - by date were included in the recall .
The products were distributed throughout the U.S. and began arriving in stores in late March 2010 .
Products in Canada were not affected .
2012
CEREAL RECALL Section::::2012 cereal recall .
Kellogg 's issued a voluntary recall of some of its " Frosted Mini - Wheats Bite Size Original " and " Mini - Wheats Unfrosted Bite Size " products due to the possibility of flexible metal mesh fragments in the food .
The affected products varied in size from single - serving bowls to large 70-ounce cartons .
Use - by dates printed on the recalled packages ranged from April 1 , 2013 , to September 21 , 2013 , and were accompanied by the letters KB , AP or FK .
ADVERTISING CLAIMS
Section::::Advertising claims .
On June 3 , 2010 , Kellogg 's was found to be making unsubstantiated and misleading claims in advertising their cereal products by the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) .
Kellogg 's responded by stating " We stand behind the validity of our product claims and research , so we agreed to an order that covers those claims .
We believe that the revisions to the existing consent agreement satisfied any remaining concerns . "
The FTC had previously found fault with Kellogg 's claims that Frosted Mini - Wheats cereal improved kids ' attentiveness by nearly 20 % .
The Children 's Advertising Review Unit of the Council of Better Business Bureaus has also suggested that the language on Kellogg Pop - Tarts packages saying the pastries are " Made with Real Fruit " should be taken off the products .
In July 2012 , the UK banned a " Special K " advertisement due to its citing caloric values that did not take into account the caloric value of milk consumed with the cereal .
In 2016 an ad telling UK consumers that Special K is " full of goodness " and " nutritious " was banned .
HUMAN RIGHT VIOLATIONS OF PALM OIL IN 2016
Section::::Human
right violations of palm oil in 2016 .
According to Amnesty International in 2016 , Kellogg 's palm oil provider Wilmar International profited from 8 to 14-year - old child labor and forced labor .
Some workers were extorted , threatened or not paid for work .
Some workers suffered severe injuries from chemicals such as Paraquat .
Kellogg 's alleged not being aware of the child abuses due to traceability ; Amnesty 's human rights director replied that " Using mealy - mouthed excuses about ' traceability ' is a total cop - out . "
POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT Section::::Political involvement . Kellogg 's donated around US$ 2 million opposing California Proposition 37 , a 2012 ballot initiative that , if enacted , would have required compulsory labeling of genetically engineered food products .
In March 2016 , though , they vowed to label all of their products with genetically modified organisms as such by 2020 .
In January 2012 , Kellogg 's gave the Calhoun School a $ 250,000 grant for a " three - part youth - based project on issues of white privilege and institutionalized racism " .
In August 2014 , Kellogg 's called on the President to support the Paris Agreement on climate change .
In 2016 , Kellogg Company urged President - elect Donald Trump to " continue the Paris Climate Agreement " .
Kellogg 's has donated to notable groups opposing voter - ID laws , such as the Applied Research Center ( now RaceForward ) .
The company also decided to remove their advertisements from the Breitbart News website .
Breitbart News in turn called for a boycott of Kellogg 's products .
