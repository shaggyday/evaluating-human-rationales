ESPN COLLEGE BASKETBALL ON ABC ESPN College Basketball on ABC ( originally College Basketball on ABC ) is the branding formerly used for broadcasts of NCAA Division I college basketball games produced by ESPN , and televised on the American Broadcasting Company ( ABC ) .
ABC broadcast select college basketball games during the 1960s and 1970s , before it began televising them on a regular basis on January 18 , 1987 ( involving a game between the LSU Tigers and Kentucky Wildcats ) .
As CBS and NBC were also broadcasting college games at the time , this put the sport on all three major broadcast television networks .
ABC 's final regular college basketball broadcast aired on March 7 , 2009 ( between the Oklahoma State Cowboys and Oklahoma Sooners ) .
COVERAGE OVERVIEW 1962 , 1973 , 1978 Section::::Coverage overview .
Section::::1962 , 1973 , 1978 .
ABC first broadcast college basketball games in 1962 , when the network aired the NCAA Championship Game on a day - behind delayed basis , as part of its Wide World of Sports anthology series .
On December 15 , 1973 , ABC aired what is considered to be the first telecast of a regular season college basketball game by a major broadcast network ( between UCLA and North Carolina State in St. Louis ) .
ABC ( which had recently lost the NBA rights to CBS ) televised this game using its former NBA announcing crew of Keith Jackson and Bill Russell .
In the 1977–78 season , C.D. Chesley ( who controlled the rights to the Atlantic Coast Conference ( ACC ) at the time ) wanted NBC to televise select ACC games as part of its national package as it had done the previous few years .
However , NBC wanted to feature intersectional games .
This action greatly upset Chesley , who wound up selling the rights to the ACC Tournament final to ABC .
ABC would televise the 1978 ACC Tournament final as part of Wide World of Sports .
The game , called by Jim Lampley and Bill Russell , marked the first time Duke University 's Blue Devils basketball team played on national television .
1987–2014
Section::::1987–2014 .
When ABC 's coverage began in 1987 , the network primarily covered the Big Ten , Big 8 and Pac-10 Conferences .
By 1991 ( around the time NBC was phasing out their own college basketball coverage ) , ABC ramped up its basketball coverage in an effort to fill the void .
As a result , the network also started to cover games focusing on teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference ( ACC ) and Southeastern Conference ( SEC ) .
Otherwise , it was essentially , a considerable hodge - podge with an ACC game one week , or a Pac-10 or Big 10 game the next .
The games that were broadcast were a hodge - podge of conference matchups even after the ESPN on ABC brand change , with SEC and Big East match - ups occasionally being shown alongside frequent ACC , Big 12 and Pac-10 match - ups .
ABC 's early regular season broadcasts were , for the most part , technically time buys from organizations such as Raycom ( particularly , around 1990–91 ) or sister network ESPN .
This in return , was a way to avoid union contracts which require that 100 % of network shows had to use crew staff who were network union members .
During the early 1990s , Raycom paid ABC US$ 1.8 million for six weeks of network airtime of 26 regional games .
The format allowed Raycom to control the games and sell the advertising .
In the 1987–88 season , ABC did not air any college basketball games during the last three weekends of February due to the network 's coverage of the Winter Olympics .
Coverage by ABC steadily increased during the early 1990s ; by the 1991–92 season , ABC was carrying regional games in many timeslots on Saturday and Sunday afternoons .
By 1997 , ABC 's presenting sponsor was Paine Webber .
Starting in 1997 , coverage of the PGA Tour limited the number of games that the network showed ; this continued through 2006 .
Coverage of the NBA further decreased college basketball coverage on the network when ABC Sports acquired the broadcast rights to the league ( through a production arrangement with ESPN ) beginning in 2002 .
Beginning with the 2007 season , all games were rebranded as part of the integration of ABC Sports into ESPN as ESPN on ABC ( meaning that all sports telecasts on ABC would exclusively feature ESPN 's graphics , music and announcers ) and Sunday games were discontinued .
From 2007 to 2009 , all games began at 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time , which was a departure from the differing broadcast times that were previously assigned to the game telecasts .
From 2010 to 2013 , ABC broadcast the semi - finals and finals of the SEC Men 's Basketball Tournament .
In 2014 , ABC only broadcast the semi - final round of the tournament .

In the early years of ABC 's regular college basketball coverage , Keith Jackson and Dick Vitale were the primary announcing crew , while Gary Bender was the secondary play - by - play announcer behind Jackson .
Meanwhile , Al Michaels did regional games during this period .
When Brent Musburger came over from CBS in late 1990 , he started working with Dick Vitale on the main team .
Jim Valvano did color commentary on games for ABC for a few years until his death in 1993 ; Vitale and Valvano were paired as co - analysts on ABC 's college basketball broadcasts a few times during the 1991–92 season .
In the 1992–93 season , Terry Gannon filled in on a few games for Valvano , who at the time was battling cancer , which would ultimately claim his life in April 1993 .
Many of the announcers worked for ABC and ESPN , and ABC continued to use ESPN announcers , reporters and commentators until 2009 , never quite establishing firm ABC broadcasting teams even after the ESPN on ABC brand switch .
