DRAMATURGY ( SOCIOLOGY )
Dramaturgy is a sociological perspective commonly used in microsociological accounts of social interaction in everyday life .
The term was first adapted into sociology from the theatre by Erving Goffman , who developed most of the related terminology and ideas in his 1959 book , The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life .
Kenneth Burke , whom Goffman would later acknowledge as an influence , had earlier presented his notions of dramatism in 1945 , which in turn derives from Shakespeare .
However , the fundamental difference between Burke 's and Goffman 's view is that Burke believed that life was in fact theatre , whereas Goffman viewed theatre as a metaphor .
If we imagine ourselves as directors observing what goes on in the theatre of everyday life , we are doing what Goffman called dramaturgical analysis , the study of social interaction in terms of theatrical performance .
In dramaturgical sociology it is argued that the elements of human interactions are dependent upon time , place , and audience .
In other words , to Goffman , the self is a sense of who one is , a dramatic effect emerging from the immediate scene being presented .
Goffman forms a theatrical metaphor in defining the method in which one human being presents itself to another based on cultural values , norms , and beliefs .
Performances can have disruptions ( actors are aware of such ) , but most are successful .
The goal of this presentation of self is acceptance from the audience through carefully conducted performance .
If the actor succeeds , the audience will view the actor as he or she wants to be viewed .
A dramaturgical action is a social action that is designed to be seen by others and to improve one 's public self - image .
In addition to Erving Goffman , this concept has been used by JÃ¼rgen Habermas and Harold Garfinkel , among others .
DRAMATURGICAL PERSPECTIVE
Section::::Dramaturgical perspective .
Dramaturgical perspective is one of several sociological paradigms separated from other sociological theories because it does not examine the cause of human behavior but it analyzes the context .
This is , however , debatable within Sociology .
There are those sociologists who consider Dramaturgy a theory or theoretical framework , while others consider it a sociological paradigm .
In Frame Analysis , Goffman writes , " What is important is the sense he [ a person or actor ] provides them [ the others or audience ] through his dealing with them of what sort of person he is behind the role he is in " ( p. 298 ) .
The dramaturgical perspective can be seen as an anchor to this perspective , where the individual 's identity is performed through role(s ) , and consensus between the actor and the audience .
Because of this dependence on consensus to define social situations , the perspective argues that there is no concrete meaning to any interaction that could not be redefined .
Dramaturgy emphasizes expressiveness as the main component of interactions .
It is termed as the " fully two - sided view of human interaction " .
Dramaturgical theory suggests that a person 's identity is not a stable and independent psychological entity , but rather , it is constantly remade as the person interacts with others .
In a dramaturgical model , social interaction is analyzed in terms of how people live their lives like actors performing on a stage .
This analysis offers a look at the concepts of status and role .
A status is like a part in a play , and a role serves as a script , supplying dialogue and action for the characters .
As on the stage , people in their everyday lives manage settings , clothing , words , and nonverbal actions to give a particular impression to others .
Goffman described each individual 's " performance " as the presentation of self , a person 's efforts to create specific impressions in the minds of others .
This process is sometimes called " impression management " .
Goffman makes an important distinction between " front stage " and " back stage " behavior .
As the term / concept implies , " front stage " actions are visible to the audience and are part of the performance .
People engage in " back stage " behaviors when no audience is present .
For example , a server in a restaurant is likely to perform one way in front of customers but might be much more casual in the kitchen .
It is likely that he or she does things in the kitchen that might seem unseemly in front of customers .
Before an interaction with another , an individual prepares a role , or impression , that he or she wants to make on the other .
These roles are subject to what is in theater termed " breaking character " .
Inopportune intrusions may occur , in which a backstage performance is interrupted by someone who is not meant to see it .
In addition , there are examples of how the audience for any personal performance plays a part in determining the course it takes : how typically we ignore many performance flaws out of tact , such as if someone trips or spits as they speak .
PERFORMANCE Section::::Performance .
There are seven important elements Goffman identifies with respect to the performance : * Belief in the part one is playing is important , even if it can not be judged by others .
The audience can only try to guess whether the performer is sincere or cynical .
*
* The front or ' the mask ' is a standardized , generalizable and transferable technique for the performer to control the manner in which the audience perceives him or her .
*
* Dramatic realization is a portrayal of aspects of the performer that s / he wants the audience to know .
When the performer wants to stress something , s / he will carry on the dramatic realization .
* * Idealization .
A performance often presents an idealized view of the situation to avoid confusion ( misrepresentation ) and strengthen other elements ( fronts , dramatic realization ) .
Audiences often have an ' idea ' of what a given situation ( performance ) should look like and performers will try to carry out the performance according to that idea .
*
* Maintenance of expressive control refers to the need to stay ' in character ' .
The performance has to make sure that s / he sends out the correct signals and quiets the occasional compulsion to convey misleading ones that might detract from the performance .
*
* Misrepresentation refers to the danger of conveying a wrong message .
The audience tends to think of a performance as genuine or false , and performers generally wish to avoid having an audience disbelieve them ( whether they are being truly genuine or not ) .
*
* Mystification refers to the concealment of certain information from the audience , whether to increase the audience 's interest in the user or to avoid divulging information which could be damaging to the performer .
* TEAMS Section::::Teams .
Within this analysis , teams are groups of individuals who cooperate with each other in order to share the ' party line ' .
Team members must share information as mistakes reflect on everyone .
Team members also have inside knowledge and are not fooled by one another 's performances .
STAGES
Section::::Stages .
Stages or regions refer to the three distinct areas where different individuals with different roles and information can be found .
There are three stages : front , back and outside .
FRONT STAGE
Section::::Front stage .
Within society we are expected to present ourselves in a certain way , however , when a person goes against the norm society tends to notice .
Therefore , we are expected to put on a costume and act different when in front of the audience .
Goffman noticed this habit of society and developed the idea of front stage .
In his book The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life , Goffman defines front as " that part of the individual 's performance which regularly functions in a general and fixed fashion we define the situation for those who observe the performance .
Front , then , is the expressive equipment of a standard kind intentionally or unwittingly employed by the individual during his performance " ( 486 ) .
During the front stage , the actor formally performs and adheres to conventions that have meaning to the audience .
It is a part of the dramaturgical performance that is consistent and contains generalized ways to explain the situation or role the actor is playing to the audience that observes it .
The actor knows he or she is being watched and acts accordingly .
This is a fixed presentation .
This concept can be seen in the 2005 film Waiting .
The servers have to act much more proper and presentable in the dining room than they do in the kitchen .
Goffman says that the front stage involves a differentiation between setting and personal front .
These two concepts are necessary for the actor to have a successful performance .
Setting is the scene that must be present in order for the actor to perform ; if it is gone , the actor can not perform .
Personal front consists of items or equipment needed in order to perform .
These items are usually identifiable by the audience as a constant representation of the performance and actor .
The personal front is divided into two different aspects , appearance and manners .
Appearance refers to the items of the personal front that are a reflection of the actor 's social status .
Manner refers to the way an actor conducts themselves .
The actor 's manner tells the audience what to expect from his performance .
BACK STAGE Section::::Back stage .
Goffman 's definition of backstage from his book The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life states that the back stage is where " the performer can relax ; he can drop his front , forgo speaking in his lines , and step out of character " ( 488 ) .
When all is said and done , and the individual returns to the back stage , they feel such a sense of relief that they know the actions that would not be condoned upon in the front stage are free to be expressed .
All their actions are not to please anyone but their self in the backstage .
Back stage is where performers are present but audience is not , and the performers can step out of character without fear of disrupting the performance .
It is where facts suppressed in the front stage or various kinds of informal actions may appear .
Simply put , the back stage is completely separate from the front stage .
No members of the audience can appear in the back .
The actor takes many methods to ensure this .
Back region is a relative term , it exists only in regards to a specific audience : where two or more people are present , there will almost never be a true ' back region ' .
OUTSIDE Section::::Outside .
Outside , or off - stage , is the place where individuals are not involved in the performance ( although they may not be aware of it ) .
The off - stage is where individual actors meet the audience members independently of the team performance on the front stage .
Specific performances may be given when the audience is segmented as such .
BORDERS / REGIONS Section::::Borders / regions .
Borders or boundaries are important as they prevent or restrict movement of individuals between various regions .
Performers need to be able to maneuver boundaries to manage who has the access to the performance , when and how .
The border phenomenon is highlighted by Victor Turner 's liminality - concept , and thus prolonged in the imaginable field : semiotics of ritual .
The management of thresholds may be operated on several axes ; the most crude is exclusion - inclusion , similar to the basic digital on - off ( 1 â 0 ) ; to be a part or not may be seen as the fundamental asset in a society ; but as far society is perceived as a rhizomatic conglomerate ; rather such than a unitary , or arborescent whole ; border - control , so to speak , becomes in a paradoxical fashion the central issue .
Thus the study of liminality in sociology , ritual and theatre reveals the fictional elements underpinning society .
Rites of passage seem to reflect this as the enactments of exclusion , and dissociation seem to be an essential feature of such .
The enactment of exclusion from a society seem to be essential for the formation of an imaginary central governing ( cf .
dMichel Foucault ) .
DISCREPANT ROLES Section::::Discrepant roles .
Many performances need to prevent the audience from getting some information ( secrets ) .
For that , several specialized roles are created .
SECRETS Section::::Secrets .
There are different types of secrets which have to be concealed for various reasons : * Dark secrets .
Those represent information about the performing team which could contradict the image the team is presenting to the audience .
* Strategic secrets .
Those represent the team 's goals , capabilities and know - hows which allows the team to control the audience and lead it in the direction the team desires * Inside secrets .
Those represent information known by the team and are seen as something that is shared only with other teammates to increase team bonding .
* Entrusted secrets .
Those secrets have to be kept in order to maintain the role and team integrity ; keeping them demonstrates trustworthiness .
* Free secret .
Another 's secret , not related to oneself and one that can be disclosed while still maintaining the role .
Disclosure of such secrets should not affect the performance .
ROLES Section::::Roles .
There are three basic roles in Goffman 's scheme , each centered on who has access to what information .
Performers are most knowledgeable .
Audiences know only what the performers disclosed and what they have observed themselves .
Outsiders have little if any relevant information .
The roles can be divided into three groups and include : Roles dealing with manipulation information and team borders : * The " informer " : a pretender to the role of a team member who gains teams trust , is allowed backstage , but then joins the audience and discloses information on the performance .
Examples : spies or traitors .
* The " Shill " :
this role is an opposite of the informer ; the shill pretends to be a member of the audience but is a member of the performing team .
His role is to manipulate the audience reactions .
* The " Spotter " : a member of the audience who has much information about the performance in general .
The spotter analyzes the performers and may reveal information to the audience .
Example : food critic in a restaurant .
Roles dealing with facilitating interactions between two other teams :
* The " go - between " or " mediator " : usually acts with the permission of both sides , acting as a mediator and/or messenger , facilitating communication between various teams .
Go - between learn many secrets , and may not be neutral .
Roles that mix front and back region up :
* The " non - person " : individuals who are present during the performance , may even be allowed in the back stage but are not part of the " show " .
Their role is usually obvious and thus they are usually ignored by the performers and the audience .
Example : a waiter , cleaning lady .
* The " service specialist " : individuals whose specialized services are required , usually by the performers .
They are often invited by the performers to the back region .
Example : hairdresser , plumbers , bankers with tax knowledge .
* The " colleague " : individuals who are similar to the performers but are not members of the team in question .
Example : coworkers .
*
* The " confidant " : individuals to whom the performer reveals details of the performance .
* COMMUNICATION OUT OF CHARACTER Section::::Communication out of character .
Performers may communicate out of character on purpose , to signal to others on their team , or by accident .
Common backstage communications out of character include : * Treatment of the absent : derogatory discussion of the absent audience or performers affecting team cohesion .
*
Staging talk : discussion of technical aspects of the performance , gossip .
Common frontstage communications out of character include : *
Team collusion :
between team members , during the performance but not endangering it .
Example : staging cues , kicking a friend under a table .
* Realigning actions : between members of opposing teams .
For example : unofficial grumbling .
IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT Section::::Impression management .
Impression management refers to work on maintaining the desired impression .
It is composed of defensive and protective techniques .
Defensive techniques are employed before an interaction starts and involve :
* Dramaturgical loyalty :
work to keep the team members loyal to the team members and to the performance itself .
* Dramaturgical discipline : dedicating oneself to the performance but without losing oneself in it .
Self - control , making sure one can play the part properly , rehearsal .
* Dramaturgical circumspection : minimizing risk by preparing for expected problems .
Being careful to avoid situations where a mistake or a potential problem can occur , choosing the right audience , length and venue of performance .
Protective techniques are used once the interaction begins in order to cover mistakes .
For example , relying on audience to use tact and overlook mistakes of the performers .
CRITIQUE Section::::Critique .
It has been argued that dramaturgy should only be applied in instances that involve people associated with a total institution .
The theory was designed for total institutions and some believe that theories should not be applied where they have not been tested .
In addition to this , it also has been said that dramaturgy does not contribute to sociology 's goal of understanding the legitimacy of society .
It is claimed to be drafting on positivism , which does not offer an interest in both reason and rationality ; John Welsh called it a " commodity " .
APPLICATION
Section::::Application .
Research on this is best done through fieldwork such as participant observation .
For one , dramaturgy has been used to depict how social movements communicate power .
Robert D. Benford and Scott A. Hunt argued that " social movements can be described as dramas in which protagonists and antagonists compete to affect audiences ' interpretations of power relations in a variety of domains " .
The people seeking power present their front stage self in order to captivate attention .
However , the back stage self is still present , though undetectable .
This is a competition of power , a prime example of dramaturgy .
A useful , and everyday way of understanding dramaturgy ( specifically front stage and back stage ) is to think of a waiter or waitress at a restaurant .
Their main avenue of concern for him or her is " customer service " .
Even if a customer is rude , waiters and/or waitresses are expected to be polite ( " the customer is always right " ) as part of their job responsibilities .
That same waiter or waitress speaks differently when going out to her / his break room .
s / he may complain , mimic and discuss with their fellow peers how irritating and rude the customer is .
In this example , the waiter / waitress acts a certain way when dealing with customers and acts a completely different way when with her / his fellow employees .
Dramaturgy has also been applied to the emerging interdisciplinary domain of scholarly research known as technoself studies ; which deals with human identity in a technological society .
In terms of blogging , ( specifically in fashion blogging ) bloggers ad their readers share a social setting in the form of an online platform .
The blogger can build up his or her own persona and create an image of themselves that may be far removed from who they actually are in the real world â in other words , fashion blogging is an " authoritative performance " for one 's style .
A relationship is created between the blogger and the audience where the blogger is in control of how and what represents them , while the audience are spectators to this presentation of the blogger 's self .
