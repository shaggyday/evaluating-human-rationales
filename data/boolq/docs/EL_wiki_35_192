GOVERNOR ( UNITED STATES )
In the United States , a governor serves as the chief executive officer and commander - in - chief in each of the fifty states and in the five permanently inhabited territories , functioning as both head of state and head of government therein .
As such , governors are responsible for implementing state laws and overseeing the operation of the state executive branch .
As state leaders , governors advance and pursue new and revised policies and programs using a variety of tools , among them executive orders , executive budgets , and legislative proposals and vetoes .
Governors carry out their management and leadership responsibilities and objectives with the support and assistance of department and agency heads , many of whom they are empowered to appoint .
A majority of governors have the authority to appoint state court judges as well , in most cases from a list of names submitted by a nominations committee .
All but five states ( Arizona , Maine , New Hampshire , Oregon , and Wyoming ) have a lieutenant governor .
The lieutenant governor succeeds to the gubernatorial office ( the powers and duties but not the office , in Massachusetts and West Virginia ) , if vacated by the removal from office , death , or resignation of the previous governor .
Lieutenant governors also serve as unofficial acting state governors in case the incumbent governors are unable to fulfill their duties , and they often serve as presiding officers of the upper houses of state legislatures .
But in such cases , they can not participate in political debates , and they have no vote whenever these houses are not equally divided .
ROLE AND POWERS Section::::Role and powers .
States are the primary subdivisions of the United States , and possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution , such as regulating intrastate commerce , running elections , creating local governments , and ratifying constitutional amendments .
Each state has its own constitution , grounded in republican principles , and government , consisting of three branches : executive , legislative , and judicial .
Also , due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government , Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside .
The governor heads the government 's executive branch in each state or territory and , depending on the individual jurisdiction , may have considerable control over government budgeting , the power of appointment of many officials ( including many judges ) , and a considerable role in legislation .
The governor may also have additional roles , such as that of commander - in - chief of the state 's National Guard ( when not federalized ) and of that state 's respective defense force ( which is not subject to federalization ) .
In many states and territories the governor also has partial or absolute power to commute or pardon a criminal sentence .
All U.S. governors serve four - year terms except those in New Hampshire and Vermont , who serve two - year terms .
In all states , the governor is directly elected , and in most cases has considerable practical powers , though this may be moderated by the state legislature and in some cases by other elected executive officials .
In the five extant U.S. territories , all governors are now directly elected as well , though in the past many territorial governors were historically appointed by the President of the United States .
Governors can veto state bills , and in all but seven states they have the power of the line - item veto on appropriations bills ( a power the President does not have ) .
In some cases legislatures can override a gubernatorial veto by a two - thirds vote , in others by three - fifths .
In Alabama , Indiana , Kentucky , and Tennessee , the governor 's veto can be overridden by a simple majority vote , making it virtually useless .
In Arkansas , a gubernatorial veto may be overridden by an absolute majority .
The Governor of North Carolina had no veto power until a 1996 referendum .
In 47 of the 50 states , whenever there is a vacancy of one of the state 's U.S. Senate seats , that state 's governor has the power to appoint someone to fill the vacancy until a special election is held ; the governors of Oregon , Alaska , and Wisconsin do not have this power .
A state governor may give an annual State of the State address in order to satisfy a constitutional stipulation that a governor must report annually ( or in older constitutions described as being " from time to time " ) on the state or condition of the state .
Governors of states may also perform ceremonial roles , such as greeting dignitaries , conferring state decorations , issuing symbolic proclamations or attending the state fair .
The governor may also have an official residence ( see Governor 's Mansion ) .
In a ranking of the power of the governorship in all 50 states , University of North Carolina political scientist Thad Beyle makes the distinction between " personal powers " of governors , which are factors that vary from person to person , season to season - and the " institutional powers " that are set in place by law .
Examples of measurable personal factors are how large a governor 's margin of victory was on election day , and where he or she stands in public opinion polls .
Whether a governor has strong budget controls , appointment authority , and veto powers are examples of institutional powers .
HISTORY Section::::History .
In colonial North America , governors were chosen in a variety of ways , depending on how the colony was organized .
In the crown colonies of Great Britain , France , and Spain , the governor was chosen by the ruling monarch of the colonizing power , or his designees ; in British colonies , the Board of Trade was often the primary decision maker .
Colonies based on a corporate charter , such as the Connecticut Colony and the Massachusetts Bay Colony , elected their own governors based on rules spelled out in the charter or other colonial legislation .
In proprietary colonies , such as the Province of Carolina before it became a crown colony ( and was divided into North and South ) , governors were chosen by the Lords Proprietor who controlled the colony .
In the early years of the American Revolutionary War , eleven of the Thirteen Colonies evicted ( with varying levels of violence ) royal and proprietary governors .
The other two colonies ( Connecticut and Rhode Island ) had corporate charters ; Connecticut Governor Jonathan Trumbull was governor before and during the war period , while in Rhode Island , Governor Joseph Wanton was removed from office in 1775 for failing to support the rebel war effort .
Before achieving statehood , many of the 50 states were territories or parts of territories .
Administered by the federal government , they had governors who were appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate rather than elected by the resident population .
Election of territorial governors began in Puerto Rico in 1948 .
The last appointed territorial governor , Hyrum Rex Lee in American Samoa , left office in 1978 .

SALARY Section::::Salary .
The average salary of a state governor in 2009 was $ 124,398 .

TERM LIMITS RELATIONSHIP WITH LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR
Section::::Relationship with lieutenant governor .
The type of relationship between the governor and the lieutenant governor greatly varies by state .
In some states the governor and lieutenant governor are completely independent of each other , while in others the governor gets to choose ( prior to the election ) who would be his or her lieutenant governor .
* Five states do not have a lieutenant governor .
In those states , a different constitutional officer assumes the office of the governor should there be a vacancy in the office .
Those states are Arizona ( Sec . of State ) , Maine ( Pres . of Senate ) , New Hampshire ( Pres . of Senate ) , Oregon ( Sec . of State ) , and Wyoming ( Sec . of State ) .
* Seventeen states have separate elections for the governor and the lieutenant governor , which may lead to the governor and the lieutenant governor being from different parties .
Those states are Alabama , Arkansas , California , Delaware , Georgia , Idaho , Louisiana , Mississippi , Missouri , Nevada , North Carolina , Oklahoma , Rhode Island , Texas , Vermont , Virginia , and Washington .
* Two states have the State Senate appoint the lieutenant governor , which may mean that the governor and the lieutenant governor are from different parties .
Those states are Tennessee and West Virginia .
* Eight states have the governor and lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket , but the governor does not get to choose his / her running mate .
In those states , the winners of the governor primaries and the winners of the lieutenant governor primaries run together as joint tickets in the general election .
The governor and lieutenant governor would therefore be from the same party , but may not necessarily be political allies .
Those states are Alaska , Hawaii , Massachusetts , Michigan , New York , Pennsylvania , New Mexico , Connecticut , and Wisconsin .
* Eighteen states have the governor and lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket similar to the President and Vice President of the United States .
