RANGE ROVER
The Land Rover Range Rover ( generally known simply as a Range Rover ) is a full - sized luxury sport utility vehicle ( SUV ) from Land Rover , a marque of Jaguar Land Rover .
The Range Rover was launched in 1970 by British Leyland .
This flagship model is now in its fourth generation .
Jaguar Land Rover has also extended the use of the Land Rover Range Rover sub - brand with the introduction of Range Rover Evoque , the Range Rover Velar and the Range Rover Sport .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The Rover Company ( originator of the Land Rover marque ) was experimenting with a larger model than the Land Rover Series in 1951 , when the Rover P4-based two - wheel - drive " Road Rover " project was developed by Gordon Bashford .
This was shelved in 1958 , and the idea lay dormant until 1966 , when engineers Spen King and Bashford set to work on a new model .
In 1967 , the first Range Rover prototype was built ( number plate SYE 157F ) , with the classic Range Rover shape discernible , but with a different front grille and headlight configuration .
The design of the Range Rover was finalised in 1969 .
Twenty - six Velar engineering development vehicles were built between 1969 and 1970 and were road registered with the number plates YVB151H through to YVB177H.
Though being chassis no . 3 , the vehicle YVB 153H is believed to have been the first off the production line as a vehicle in that colour was urgently required for marketing .
The Velar name was derived from the Italian " velare " meaning to veil or to cover .
Range Rover development engineer Geof Miller used the name as a decoy for registering pre - production Range Rovers .
The Velar company was registered in London and produced 40 pre - production vehicles that were built between 1967 and 1970 .
Most of these Velar pre - production vehicles are accounted for and have survived into preservation .
The Range Rover was launched in 1970 .
In the early 1970s , the Musée du Louvre in Paris exhibited a Range Rover as an " exemplary work of industrial design " .
In 1972 , the British Trans - Americas Expedition became the first vehicle - based expedition to traverse the Americas from north - to - south , including traversing the roadless Darién Gap .
The specially modified Range Rovers used for this expedition are now on display in the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust collection at Gaydon , Warwickshire .
Between 1974 and 1987 , Land Rover vehicles were only sold in the United States through the grey market .
The Land Rover company began selling the Range Rover officially in the U.S. on 16 March 1987 .
From that time until 1993 , the U.S. marketing was all in the name of Range Rover , because it was the only model offered in the American market .
In 1993 , with the arrival of the Defender 110 and the imminent arrival of the Land Rover Discovery , the company 's U.S. sales were under the name " Land Rover North America " .
In 2004 , Land Rover launched another model under the Range Rover brand – the Range Rover Sport , which was based on the Land Rover Discovery platform , but
the new Range Rover Sport has the latest Range Rover platform .
In 2011 , the Range Rover Evoque was launched .
FIRST GENERATION ( 1970–1996 )
Section::::First generation ( 1970–1996 ) .
The first - generation Range Rover was produced between 1970 and 1996 .
It was available only in a 2-door body until 1981 , though prior to this 4-door models were produced by specialist firms .
Unlike other 4x4s such as the Jeep Wagoneer , the original Range Rover was not designed as a luxury - type vehicle .
While certainly up - market compared to preceding Land Rover models , the early Range Rovers had fairly basic , utilitarian interiors with vinyl seats and plastic dashboards that were designed to be washed down with a hose .
Convenience features such as power steering , carpeted floors , air conditioning , cloth / leather seats , and wooden interior trim were fitted later .
The Range Rover was a body - on - frame design with a box section ladder type chassis , like the contemporary Series Land Rovers .
The Range Rover used coil springs as opposed to leaf springs , permanent four - wheel drive , and four - wheel disc brakes .
The Range Rover was originally powered by various Rover V8 engines and diesel engines .
Originally , the Range Rover was fitted with a detuned version of the Buick - derived Rover V8 engine .
In 1984 , the engine was fitted with Lucas fuel injection , boosting power to .
The 3.5-litre ( 3,528 cc ) engine was bored out to a displacement of 3.9 litres ( 3,947 cc ) for the 1990 model year , and 4.2-litre ( 4,215 cc ) in 1992 ( 1993 model year ) for the 108-inch Long Wheelbase Vogue LSE ( County LWB [ long wheelbase ] in North America ) .
One of the first significant changes came in 1981 , with the introduction of a four - door body .
Shortly after twin thermo fan technology was introduced to reduce significant overheating problems 1970s models experienced in Australia .
In 1988 , LR introduced a 2.4-litre turbodiesel ( badged Vogue Turbo D ) arrived with , manufactured by Italian VM Motori .
The same engine was also available in the Rover SD1 passenger car .
The diesel project was codenamed project Beaver .
During the project , 12 world records were broken , including the fastest diesel SUV to reach , and the furthest a diesel SUV has travelled in 24 hours .
In 1990 project Otter was unveiled .
This was a mildly tuned 2.5-litre , version of the ' Beaver ' 2.4 .
In 1992 , Land Rover finally introduced their own diesel engines in the Range Rover , beginning with the 200TDi , first released in the Land Rover Discovery and following in 1994 , the 300 TDi , again with 111 bhp .
The Range Rover with chassis no . 1 was a green model with the registration " YVB 151H " , and is now on exhibition at Huddersfield Land Rover Centre , Huddersfield , West Yorkshire .
The first generation model was known as the Range Rover until almost the end of its run , when Land Rover introduced the name Range Rover Classic to distinguish it from its successors .
AUSTRALIAN ASSEMBLY Section::::Australian assembly .
Jaguar - Rover - Australia began assembly of the Range Rover from CKD kits at its Enfield plant , in New South Wales , Australia in 1979 .
Government increases in the tariff on parts led to Australian assembly being discontinued in 1983 .
UTILITY VEHICLES Section::::Utility vehicles .
The first - generation Range Rover served as the base for specialist utility vehicles .
These included the Carmichaels International six - wheel Fire Tender .
This was a two - door model with an extended chassis and a third " lazy " axle added .
Designed for small airfield use , it had a water - pump mounted on the front bumper driven directly by the V8 's crankshaft .
The MoD purchased them for the RAF , this version was called the TACR2 .
Carmichaels was contracted to supply the modified chassis and the fire - fighting body was supplied and mounted by Gloster - Saro .
These were four - door versions using an internally mounted water - pump driven by a gearbox PTO .
At least one of these ( at Duxford IWM ) has been converted into a full 6x6 by linking a drive - through unit to the two rear axles ' differentials .
SECOND GENERATION ( 1994–2002 )
Section::::Second generation ( 1994–2002 ) .
25 years from the introduction of the first - generation Range Rover , the second - generation Range Rover — model - designation P38A — was introduced for the 1995 model year , with an updated version of the Rover V8 engine .
There was also the option of a 2.5-litre BMW six - cylinder turbo - diesel with a Bosch injection pump .
This was the first diesel injection with electronic controls in a Land Rover , before common rails were introduced .
This was a result of BMW 's subsequent ownership of Rover Group and hence the Land Rover brand .
The new model offered more equipment and premium trims , positioning the vehicle above the Land Rover Discovery to face the increased competition in the SUV marketplace .
This model was the last to feature the Rover V8 and interior leather supplied by Connolly who went out of business in 2002 .
It was the first model to feature Satellite Navigation as an option .
THIRD GENERATION ( 2002–2012 )
Section::::Third generation ( 2002–2012 ) .
In 2002 , the third - generation model was introduced , which saw the model move further up - market .
Planned and developed under BMW ownership the third generation was to share components and systems ( electronics , core power units etc . )
with the BMW 7 Series ( E38 ) .
It was designed to accommodate BMW 's 4.4 litre M62 V8 engines for future models .
The manual transmission was dropped entirely , leaving only the automatic .
The 7 Series electronics system was being phased out during the development of the third - generation Range Rover and being replaced with the electronics from the BMW 5 Series ( E39 ) .
Note that there were three " Generations " of the L322 , from 2002 until 2005 was the aforementioned M62 BMW V8 with ZF 5HP-24 transmission , going along to 2006 until 2009 a 4.4-litre Jaguar derived engine alongside a 4.2-litre supercharged variant of the Jaguar engine partnered with the ZF 6HP-26 transmission .
In 2010 Land Rover fitted the newly designed 5.0 N / A and Supercharged engine with ZF 6HP-26 until the 2012 model year , which saw the end of the L322 production .
This list does not give diesel options .
From 2002 - 2004 the L322 saw a standard BMW E39 electrics system .
From 2005 - 2009 the L322 saw an updated Jaguar derived electrics system with fibre optics and Bluetooth .
From 2010 - 2012 the L322 saw an updated ( different from 05 - 09 )
Jaguar derived electrics , the first " modern feeling " system .
In MY06 the first exterior update was applied with a slight face - lift of front fascia , tail lamps .
Some other slight differences can be found on the " Supercharged " variant .
The second exterior update was in 2010 , bringing a true modern feel to the L322 with new fascia , tail lamps , side grills , and clear side markers .
The interiors stayed relatively the same with exclusions i.e. Supercharged trim black piano finish until 2006.5 , ( NAS 2007 )
where an updated interior was released .
Another major change was in 2010 .

SPORT
Section::::Expanded line .
Section::::Range Rover Sport .
On 26 November 2004 , Land Rover released the first photographs of the Range Rover Sport , a new model it planned to show to the public for the first time at the 2004 North American International Auto Show .
The Range Rover Sport is a production car development of the Range Stormer concept vehicle the company showcased in the 2004 North American International Auto Show .
Though called the Range Rover Sport " L320 " , it was not merely a new specification within the Range Rover line - up , but rather an adapted Discovery " L319 " , or T5 Platform Discovery / LR3 with Range Rover exterior styling and Range Rover interior seating and dash forms , a shortened wheelbase , smaller luggage capacity and a single rather than split tailgate which was angled back for styling improvements .
With entry model pricing close to upper Discovery models , the Sport became the biggest seller of all the Land Rover products .
This model was released for sale in late 2004 as a 2004 model .
In 2013 a redesigned version was released for sale as a 2014 model year " L494 " .
Unlike the original and current Discovery , it does not have a steel chassis rails but is based on the new D7u alloy Platform , which much more resembles current flagship Range Rover with closer equipment levels and capabilities in a smaller body style .
Hence the L494 Range Rover Sport is around 400 kg lighter than the previous generation and benefits in performance due to its weight reduction .
RANGE ROVER EVOQUE Section::::Range Rover Evoque .
The Range Rover Evoque , which went into production in July 2011 , has its roots in the Land Rover LRX concept car ; with which it bears an almost identical resemblance .
It is available with either a three - door or five - door hatchback body , front - wheel drive or four - wheel drive and with a 2-litre turbocharged petrol engine or one of two different power output 2.0-litre turbo - diesel engines .
In 2012 , at the Geneva Motor Show , Land Rover unveiled a convertible concept , which featured four seats and a drop - down tailgate .
RANGE ROVER VELAR Section::::Range Rover Velar .
Land Rover unveiled a mid - size crossover using the Range Rover name in March 2017 .
Named the Range Rover Velar , it has a roof line running away on its bodywork and uses the same platform as the Jaguar F - Pace , which serves as the basis for its design .
CRITICISM Section::::Criticism .
The Range Rover brand has attracted some controversy , particularly from those concerned with the potential negative environmental impact of large , luxury vehicles .
In 2005 , members of Greenpeace temporarily disrupted Range Rover production at the Land Rover plant in Solihull .
In 2004 , Spen King criticised SUV owners who drove their vehicles in urban areas , saying that vehicles like the Range Rover he created were " never intended as a status symbol but later incarnations of my design seem to be intended for that purpose . "
In 2014 it was reported that Range Rovers could be opened and started using hand - held equipment readily available from eBay .
High levels of theft rendered Range Rovers not insurable .
Range Rovers , according to AutoTrader , " can be complicated , costly vehicles , and are loaded with very expensive parts .
"
Reliability issues are common complaints .
J.D. Power rankings for the Land Rover are in the lowest category - known as " The Rest " - for quality overall , dependability , sales satisfaction , and customer service , with the cars only earning a " Better than Most " rank in the performance and design overall category .
The Land Rover brand has " a legacy of quality problems " and ranks " at the bottom of the J.D. Power reliability ratings for three - year - old vehicles " .
The JD Power 2014 U.S. Customer Service Index ( CSI ) study ranked Land Rover last in overall customer satisfaction .
However , one Motor Trend review of a 2014 Range Rover after turned up only two things that went wrong with the car .
According to an automotive journalist , " Land Rover does n't care about JD Power ratings because it does n't need to care " since people " still line up for months to pay full sticker . "
