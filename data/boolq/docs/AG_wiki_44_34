HISTORY Section::::History .
The office , in one form or another , is older than both the United States Constitution and the United States Declaration of Independence .
Benjamin Franklin was appointed by the Continental Congress as the first Postmaster General in 1775 , serving just over 15 months .
Until 1971 , the postmaster general was the head of the Post Office Department ( or simply " Post Office " until the 1820s ) .
During that era , the postmaster general was appointed by the President of the United States , with the advice and consent of the United States Senate .
From 1829 to 1971 , the postmaster general was a member of the President 's Cabinet .
The Cabinet post of Postmaster General was often given to a new President 's campaign manager or other key political supporter , and was considered something of a sinecure .
The Postmaster General was in charge of the governing party 's patronage , and was a powerful position which held much influence within the party .
In 1971 , the Post Office Department was re - organized into the United States Postal Service , an independent agency of the executive branch .
Therefore , the Postmaster General is no longer a member of the Cabinet and is no longer in the line of presidential succession .
The postmaster general is now appointed by nine " governors , " appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate .
The governors , along with the postmaster general and the deputy postmaster general , constitute the full Postal Service Board of Governors .
The Postmaster General is the second - highest paid U.S. government official , based on publicly available salary information , after the President of the United States .
