PYRAMID LAKE
( LOS ANGELES COUNTY , CALIFORNIA ) Pyramid Lake is a reservoir formed by Pyramid Dam on Piru Creek in the eastern San Emigdio Mountains , near Castaic , Southern California .
It is a part of the West Branch California Aqueduct , which is a part of the California State Water Project .
Its water is fed by the system after being pumped up from the San Joaquin Valley and through the Tehachapi Mountains .
HISTORY Section::::History .
In 1843 , gold was discovered near what is now Pyramid Lake , in the Santa Feliciana Canyon , just south of what is now Pyramid Dam .
The small find failed to trigger a rush to the mountainous countryside .
Only Francisco Lopes , owner of Rancho Temescal , a Mexican land grant , and a handful of ranchers attempted to settle the region .
This lake was created in 1972 , and completed in 1973 , as a holding reservoir for the California State Water Project .
The lake was named after a pyramid - shaped rock carved out by engineers building U.S. Route 99 .
Travelers between Los Angeles and Bakersfield christened the landmark " Pyramid Rock , " which still stands just adjacent to the dam .
GEOGRAPHY
Section::::Geography .
Pyramid Lake is the deepest lake in the California Water Project system , built up along the steep canyon walls surrounding Piru Creek .
The reservoir lies on the border between the Angeles National Forest and the Los Padres National Forest , in the northwestern portion of Los Angeles County .
It is to the west of Interstate 5 ( I-5 ) south of Tejon Pass .
The former alignment of US 99 is below the waters here , replaced by I-5 . Just below the dam , Piru Creek returns to its natural state as it winds down through the Topatopa Mountains to feed into the Lake Piru reservoir and later the Santa Clara River .
Pumps carry water from Pyramid Lake to Castaic Lake , which is the terminus of the west branch of the aqueduct .
Pyramid and Castaic act as the upper and lower reservoirs for a 1,495-megawatt pumped storage hydroelectric plant .
