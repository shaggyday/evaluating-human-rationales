The railroad line that now hosts the Blue Water arrived from Port Huron in 1871 and originally a wooden structure served as the passenger station .
A 1905 stone and brick station replaced it but was moved to Muskegon in 1927 .
The third GTW depot , located at 120 East 14th Street near Downtown Flint , was used by Amtrak until 1989 and demolished thereafter .
The current station on M-54 ( Dort Highway ) provides easy access to I-69 . From 1982â€“2004 , the station was served by the International Limited , which was operated jointly by Via Rail and Amtrak and ran between Chicago and Toronto .
