PYRAMIDAL TRACTS
The pyramidal tracts include both the corticobulbar tract and the corticospinal tract .
These are aggregations of efferent nerve fibers from the upper motor neurons that travel from the cerebral cortex and terminate either in the brainstem ( corticobulbar ) or spinal cord ( corticospinal ) and are involved in the control of motor functions of the body .
The corticobulbar tract conducts impulses from the brain to the cranial nerves .
These nerves control the muscles of the face and neck and are involved in facial expression , mastication , swallowing , and other functions .
The corticospinal tract conducts impulses from the brain to the spinal cord .
It is made up of a lateral and anterior tract .
The corticospinal tract is involved in voluntary movement .
The majority of fibres of the corticospinal tract cross over in the medulla oblongata , resulting in muscles being controlled by the opposite side of the brain .
The corticospinal tract also contains Betz cells ( the largest pyramidal cells ) , which are not found in any other region of the body .
The pyramidal tracts are named because they pass through the pyramids of the medulla oblongata .
The corticospinal fibers when descending from the internal capsule to the brain stem , converge to a point from multiple directions giving the impression of an inverted pyramid .
The myelination of the pyramidal fibres is incomplete at birth and gradually progresses in cranio - caudal direction and thereby progressively gaining functionality .
Most of the myelination is complete by two years of age and thereafter it progresses very slowly in cranio - caudal direction up to twelve years of age .
STRUCTURE
Section::::Structure .
The term pyramidal tracts refers to upper motor neurons that originate in the cerebral cortex and terminate in the spinal cord ( corticospinal ) or brainstem ( corticobulbar ) .
Nerves emerge in the cerebral cortex , pass down and may cross sides in the medulla oblongata , and travel as part of the spinal cord until they synapse with interneurons in the grey column of the spinal cord .
There is some variation in terminology .
The pyramidal tracts definitively encompass the corticospinal tracts , and many authors also include the corticobulbar tracts .
CORTICOSPINAL TRACT
Section::::Corticospinal tract .
Nerve fibres in the corticospinal tract originate from pyramidal cells in layer V of the cerebral cortex .
Fibres arise from the primary motor cortex ( about 30 % ) , supplementary motor area and the premotor cortex ( together also about 30 % ) , and the somatosensory cortex , parietal lobe , and cingulate gyrus supplies the rest .
The cells have their bodies in the cerebral cortex , and the axons form the bulk of the pyramidal tracts .
The nerve axons travel from the cortex through the posterior limb of internal capsule , through the cerebral peduncle and into the brainstem and anterior medulla oblongata .
Here they form two prominences called the medulla oblongatary pyramids .
Below the prominences , the majority of axons cross over to the opposite side from which they originated , known as decussation .
The axons that cross over move to the outer part of the medulla oblongata and form the lateral corticospinal tract , whereas the fibres that remain form the anterior corticospinal tract .
About 80 % of axons cross over and form the lateral corticospinal tract ; 10 % do not cross over and join the tract , and 10 % of fibres travel in the anterior corticospinal tract .
The nerve axons traveling down the tract are the efferent nerve fibers of the upper motor neurons .
These axons travel down the tracts in the white matter of the spinal cord until they reach the vertebral level of the muscle that they will innervate .
At this point , the axons synapse with lower motor neurons .
The majority of axons do not directly synapse with lower motor neurons , but instead synapse with an interneuron that then synapses with a lower motor neuron .
This generally occurs in the anterior grey column .
Nerve axons of the lateral corticospinal tract that did not cross over in the medulla oblongata do so at the level of the spinal cord they terminate in .
These tracts contain more than 1 million axons and the majority of the axons are myelinated .
The corticospinal tracts myelinate largely during the first and second years after birth .
The majority of nerve axons are small ( < 4μm ) in diameter .
About 3 % of nerve axons have a much larger diameter ( 16μm ) and arise from Betz cells , mostly in the leg area of the primary motor cortex .
These cells are notable because of their rapid conduction rate , over 70m / sec , the fastest conduction of any signals from the brain to the spinal cord .
CORTICOBULBAR TRACT Section::::Corticobulbar tract .
Fibres from the ventral motor cortex travel with the corticospinal tract through the internal capsule , but terminate in a number of locations in the midbrain ( cortico - mesencephalic tract ) , pons ( Corticopontine tract ) , and medulla oblongata ( cortico - bulbar tract ) .
The upper motor neurons of the corticobulbar tract synapse with interneurons or directly with the lower motor neurons located in the motor cranial nerve nuclei , namely oculomotor , trochlear , motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve , abducens , facial nerve and accessory and in the nucleus ambiguus to the hypoglossal , vagus and accessory nerves .
These nuclei are supplied by nerves from both sides of the brain , with the exception of the parts of the facial nerve that control muscles of the lower face .
These muscles are only innervated by nerves from the contralateral ( opposite ) side of the cortex .
FUNCTION Section::::Function .
The nerves within the corticospinal tract are involved in movement of muscles of the body .
Because of the crossing - over of fibres , muscles are supplied by the side of the brain opposite to that of the muscle .
The nerves within the corticobulbar tract are involved in movement in muscles of the head .
They are involved in swallowing , phonation , and movements of the tongue .
By virtue of involvement with the facial nerve , the corticobulbar tract is also responsible for transmitting facial expression .
With the exception of lower muscles of facial expression , all functions of the corticobulbar tract involve inputs from both sides of the brain .
The term extrapyramidal motor system is used to refer to tracts within the spinal cord involved in involuntary movement but not part of the pyramidal tracts .
Their functions include the control of posture and muscle tone .
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Section::::Clinical significance .
If fibres of the corticospinal tracts are damaged anywhere along their course from the cerebral cortex to the lower end of the spinal cord , this will give rise to an upper motor neuron syndrome .
A few days after the injury to the upper motor neurons , a pattern of motor signs and symptoms appears , including spasticity , hyperactive reflexes , a loss of the ability to perform fine movements , and an extensor plantar response known as the Babinski sign .
Symptoms generally occur alongside other sensory problems .
Causes of damage may include masses such as strokes , subdural hemorrhage , abscesses and tumours , inflammation such as meningitis and multiple sclerosis , and trauma to the spinal cord , including from slipped discs .
If the corticobulbar tract is damaged on only one side , then only the lower face will be affected , however if there is involvement of both the left and right tracts , then the result is pseudobulbar palsy .
This causes problems with swallowing , speaking , and emotional lability .
Severe disabling involuntary movements such as hemiballismus or severe chorea might exhaust the patient and become a life threatening situation .
In the past , this condition was treated by partial section of the pyramidal tract either at the primary motor cortex or at the cruz cerebri ( pedunculotomy ) .
