PLOT Section::::Plot .
In 2005 , before Hurricane Katrina strikes New Orleans , Nolan Hayes rushes his wife Abigail Hayes to the emergency room as she is in labor five weeks early .
The doctor explains to Nolan that his wife gave birth to a baby girl but lost her life in the process due to liver failure .
Nolan refuses to accept her death and is in grief .
He then learns that his newborn baby needs to be kept in a ventilator for the next two days before she can breathe on her own .
The only problem is that the hurricane is beginning to flood the hospital and the ventilator ca n't be moved .
When the hurricane becomes too strong , everyone in the hospital , including the doctors and nurses , evacuate the building , leaving only Nolan and his baby ( who he names Abigail , after her mother ) in the empty hospital .
One of the nurses promises to bring back help and leaves , because Nolan is unwilling to abandon his baby .
The power then goes out and Nolan is forced to find a way to keep his baby alive .
He finds a hand - cranked generator in a storeroom and is able to manually charge the ventilator battery , but it only holds a charge for three minutes .
He also finds some more I.V.s for the baby to keep her nourished , and some food and drinks for him to stay alive as well .
With each charge the battery life gets shorter .
Using only that amount of time , Nolan tries to juggle trying to get help outside of the hospital and rushing to help his baby before her timer runs out .
Sometimes , Nolan sits down with his baby and tells the story about how he met her mother , to help keep himself preoccupied .
( The two met after stopping a bank robbery together . )
After this , Nolan finds a stray dog hiding in the hospital and takes care of it .
He names the dog Sherlock while also having illusions of talking with his late wife .
Nolan goes to the rooftop to find helicopters flying around the building .
When he tries to signal one , criminals distract it by shooting at it , demanding to be rescued first .
This leaves Nolan furious , but he has to return to his daughter to charge the battery before he can do more .
Nolan manages to also find an ambulance on a flooded street outside .
He calls for help using the ambulance 's radio , but ca n't wait for a reply when he has to return to the room to charge the battery .
Nolan attempts to find a spare battery , but has no luck .
After running back upstairs and charging the battery , he returns and finds a generator in a flooded basement room , but it is ruined from water , and almost electrocutes him .
Nolan barely returns to the room in time to charge the battery again .
Despite being awake for over 36 hours without power and running low on food , ( his hand cut from cranking the generator ) , Nolan continues to come up with more clever ways to charge the battery ( i.e. using his foot and later a rod ) .
He also plays games with Sherlock , like playing fetch with him and sharing his lunch meat given to him by one of the hospital cooks .
Looters soon start to break into the hospital and steal food , drug and saline water for the baby .
One comes in Nolan 's room and tries to steal food but gets attacked by Sherlock , who runs him off .
Nolan later realizes that this man had robbed and killed the nurse who was bringing back supplies ( as she promised earlier ) .
Since he has n't slept in almost two days , Nolan takes a shot of some adrenaline to keep himself awake .
Two more looters later break in the hospital and try to steal drugs to get high with and sell .
When Nolan finds that they are both armed with guns , Nolan takes two shots of the adrenaline and sneaks up on one , injecting him with it and giving him a fatal overdose .
Nolan takes his Marlin 336 lever - action rifle and surprises the other thug , who has discovered his baby .
Nolan shakes his head " no " while holding the rifle on him , trying to get him to leave them alone .
However , the man tries to shoot Nolan in revenge so Nolan shoots him in the head , vowing to his daughter that he will let no one hurt her .
Nolan is now so exhausted he can not crank it with his hand any longer .
Nolan has to use both his hands to slowly crank the handle , but breaks it off accidentally .
Nolan 's attempts to fix the crank generator fails , so he gives his child mouth - to - mouth resuscitation to keep her alive .
Before he can do any more , Nolan passes out from shock , stress , and exhaustion .
Nolan then hears the ventilator beeping ; it is running out of power .
However , he is too weak to get back up .
Nolan accepts that he has failed his child .
But Sherlock comes to his aid and brings two paramedics with him to save Nolan , and drag him out .
When Nolan wakes up , the paramedics hear his baby crying and run off to find her .
Abigail has finally learned to breathe on her own .
The paramedics give Nolan his baby and the two embrace , with Nolan crying tears of joy as they are brought to safety .
