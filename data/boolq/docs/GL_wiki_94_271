PLOT Section::::Plot .
In Toms River , New Jersey , the Marshalls — Rob ( Urich ) and Maria ( Kerns ) , and their three sons , 18-year - old Roby ( Barry Gray ) ,
17-year - old Chris ( Jay Underwood ) and 12-year - old John ( Johnny Galecki ) — are an apparently happy family living the American Dream .
But in September 1984 , Maria is shot and killed , and Rob claims she was murdered by a robber while he was changing a flat tire .
When the police commence their investigations , however , they discover unsettling truths about the Marshalls : Rob has secretly accumulated an enormous debt and has secured a second mortgage of $ 100,000 in Maria 's name , and is having an affair with a married neighbor , Felice Richmond ( Robin Strasser ) .
Maria had known of the affair , and had considered divorce but decided to work on their marriage shortly before she was killed .
Felice gives the police a statement that Rob wanted to get rid of his wife to collect on her life insurance , and he immediately becomes the prime suspect .
At first , Rob 's friends and sons support him .
But they begin to notice that he does not seem to be in mourning over Maria 's death , and Rob 's best friend Sal ( Joe Spano ) is angry that he is more interested in building a future with Felice .
Rob is advised by his lawyer not to contact Felice because it could influence his image ; this troubles Rob , who is deeply in love with her .
Meanwhile , the police have expanded their list of suspects to include Andrew Meyers ( Jake Dengel ) , a Louisiana shop clerk who had contact with Rob concerning his financial problems , and Arnie Eggers , a rumored hitman .
As all evidence seems to point to Rob , Felice breaks off their relationship , which leads him to unsuccessfully attempt suicide in a motel .
By this point , Chris admits for the first time that he suspects his father might in fact be guilty .
Roby and John are both shocked to hear this , strongly believing in their father 's innocence .
Rob admits to Sal that he hired Ferlin L'Heureux ( William Forsythe ) , a private detective , on the night his wife was killed to find out how he lost all of his money .
Roby has trouble coping with a recent newspaper article in which his mother 's personal life has been attacked .
Upset , he is almost involved in a car accident .
The police find an audio tape which Rob recorded shortly before he attempted to kill himself .
On tape , he speaks about L'Hereux , who in turn claims that Ricky Dunlap ( David Andrews ) was the man hired to murder Maria .
On Christmas Eve , Rob is arrested .
Roby visits him in jail and is assured by his father that he is not guilty .
The trial begins at the Atlantic Courthouse in 1986 .
L'Hereux gives detailed testimony in which he claims that Rob hired him to murder Maria so that Marshall could collect on her insurance .
L'Hereux states that he found her too beautiful to kill , and contacted Ricky Dunlap to finish the job .
Under extreme pressure from the trial , Roby and John are unable to hide their emotions , and Chris turns into an angry young man wanting justice to be served .
When the moment comes that Rob asks Roby to give false testimony which would provide him an alibi , it becomes clear to Roby that his father is not the person he thought him to be .
Dunlap is found not guilty .
The entire blame goes to Rob , disparaged by prosecuting attorney Kelly ( Dennis Farina ) as " a legend in his own mind " whom he considers many times worse than Dunlap , even if he was not the one who performed the actual murder .
Rob is sentenced to death by lethal injection .
The narration reveals that , in 1990 , Rob is on death row , waiting for appeal ; Roby finished college ; Chris became a varsity swim coach ; and John , who married at age 17 , never stopped believing in his father 's innocence .
