MASTODON Mastodons ( Greek : μαστός " breast " and ὀδούς , " tooth " ) are any species of extinct proboscideans in the genus Mammut ( family Mammutidae ) , distantly related to elephants , that inhabited North and Central America during the late Miocene or late Pliocene up to their extinction at the end of the Pleistocene 10,000 to 11,000 years ago .
Mastodons lived in herds and were predominantly forest dwelling animals that fed on a mixed diet obtained by browsing and grazing with a seasonal preference for browsing , similar to living elephants .
M. americanum , the American mastodon , is the youngest and best - known species of the genus .
They disappeared from North America as part of a mass extinction of most of the Pleistocene megafauna , widely believed to have been caused by overexploitation by Clovis hunters , and possibly also by climate change .
TAXONOMY Section::::Taxonomy .
The first remnant of Mammut , a tooth some in weight , was discovered in the village of Claverack , New York , in 1705 .
The mystery animal became known as the " incognitum " .
The first bones to be collected and studied scientifically were found in 1739 at Big Bone Lick State Park , Kentucky , by French soldiers , who carried them to the Mississippi River , from where they were transported to the National Museum of Natural History in Paris .
Some time later , similar teeth were found in South Carolina , which , according to the slaves , looked remarkably similar to those of African elephants .
This was soon followed by discoveries of complete bones and tusks in Ohio ; people started referring to the " incognitum " as a mammoth , like the ones that were being dug out in Siberia .
Anatomists noted that the teeth of mammoth and elephants were different from those of the " incognitum " , which possessed rows of large conical cusps , indicating that they were dealing with a distinct species .
In 1806 the French anatomist Georges Cuvier named the incognitum " mastodon " .
The name mastodon ( or mastodont ) means " breast tooth " ( Ancient Greek : μαστός " breast " and ὀδούς , " tooth " ) , and was assigned by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1817 , for the nipple - like projections on the crowns of its molars .
Mastodon as a genus name is obsolete ; the valid name is Mammut , a name that preceded Cuvier 's description , making Mastodon a junior synonym .
The change was met with resistance , and authors sometimes applied " Mastodon " as an informal name ; consequently it became the common term for members of the genus .
Species include : * M. americanum , the American mastodon , the best known and the last species of Mammut .
Its earliest occurrences date from the early - middle Pliocene ( early Blancan stage ) .
It had a continent - wide distribution , especially during the Pleistocene epoch , known from fossil sites ranging from present - day Alaska and New England in the north , to Florida , southern California , and as far south as Honduras .
The American mastodon resembled a woolly mammoth in appearance , with a thick coat of shaggy hair .
It had tusks that sometimes exceeded in length ; they curved upwards , but less dramatically than those of the woolly mammoth .
Its main habitat was cold spruce woodlands , and it is believed to have browsed in herds .
It became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene approximately 11,000 years ago .
* M. matthewi — found in the Snake Creek Formation of Nebraska , dating from the late Hemphillian .
Some authors consider it practically indistinguishable from M. americanum .
There is one report of it in China .
* M. raki —
Its remains were found in the Palomas Formation , near Truth or Consequences , New Mexico , dating from the early - middle Pliocene , between 4.5 and 3.6 Ma .
It coexisted with Equus simplicidens and Gigantocamelus and differs from M. americanum in having a relatively longer and narrower third molar , similar to the description of the defunct genus Pliomastodon , which supports its arrangement as an early species of Mammut .
However , like M. matthewi , some authors do not consider it sufficiently distinct from M. americanum to warrant its own species .
* M. cosoensis — found in the Coso Formation of California , dating from the late Pliocene , originally a species of Pliomastodon , it was later assigned to Mammut .
Since a tentative 1977 report of M. matthewi in China , there have been no reports of currently recognized Mammut species outside of North America according to Paleobiology database ( which does not recognize M. borsoni ) .
However , the status of Mammut or Zygolophodon borsoni in the literature appears equivocal .
EVOLUTION Section::::Evolution .
Mammut is a genus of the extinct family Mammutidae , related to the proboscidean family Elephantidae ( mammoths and elephants ) , from which it originally diverged approximately 27 million years ago .
The following cladogram shows the placement of the American mastodon among other proboscideans , based on hyoid characteristics : Over the years , several fossils from localities in North America , Africa and Asia have been attributed to Mammut , but only the North American remains have been named and described , one of them being M. furlongi , named from remains found in the Juntura Formation of Oregon , dating from the late Miocene .
However , it is no longer considered valid , leaving only four valid species .
A complete mtDNA sequence has been obtained from the tooth of an M. americanum skeleton found in permafrost in northern Alaska .
The remains are thought to be 50,000 to 130,000 years old .
This sequence has been used as an outgroup to refine divergence dates in the evolution of the Elephantidae .
The rate of mtDNA sequence change in proboscideans was found to be significantly lower than in primates .
DESCRIPTION Section::::Description .
Modern reconstructions based on partial and skeletal remains reveal that mastodons were very similar in appearance to elephants and , to a lesser degree , mammoths , though not closely related to either one .
Compared to mammoths , mastodons had shorter legs , a longer body and were more heavily muscled , a build similar to that of the current Asian elephants .
The average body size of the species M. americanum was around in height at the shoulders , corresponding to a large female or a small male ; large males were up to in height .
Among the largest male specimens , the 35-year - old AMNH 9950 was tall and weighed , while another was tall and weighed .
Like modern elephants , the females were smaller than the males .
They had a low and long skull with long curved tusks , with those of the males being more massive and more strongly curved .
Mastodons had cusp - shaped teeth , very different from mammoth and elephant teeth ( which have a series of enamel plates ) , well - suited for chewing leaves and branches of trees and shrubs .
PALEOBIOLOGY SOCIAL BEHAVIOR Section::::Paleobiology .
Section::::Social behavior .
Based on the characteristics of mastodon bone sites , it can be inferred that , as in modern proboscideans , the mastodon social group consisted of adult females and young , living in bonded groups called mixed herds .
The males abandoned the mixed herds once reaching sexual maturity and lived either alone or in male bond groupings .
As in modern elephants , there probably was no seasonal synchrony of mating activity , with both males and females seeking out each other for mating when sexually active .
DIET Section::::Diet .
Mastodons have been characterized as predominantly browsing animals .
Most accounts of gut contents have identified coniferous twigs as the dominant element in their diet .
Other accounts ( Burning tree mastodon ) have reported no coniferous content and suggest selective feeding on low , herbaceous vegetation , implying a mixed browsing and grazing diet , with evidence provided by studies of isotopic bone chemistry indicating a seasonal preference for browsing .
Study of mastodon teeth microwear patterns indicates that mastodons could adjust their diet according to the ecosystem , with regionally specific feeding patterns corresponding to boreal forest versus cypress swamps , while a population at a given location was sometimes able to maintain its dietary niche through changes in climate and browse species availability .
DISTRIBUTION AND HABITAT Section::::Distribution and habitat .
The range of most species of Mammut is unknown as their occurrences are restricted to few localities , the exception being the American mastodon ( M. americanum ) , which is one of the most widely distributed Pleistocene proboscideans in North America .
M. americanum fossil sites range in time from the faunal stages of Blancan to Rancholabrean and in locations from as far north as Alaska , as far east as Florida , and as far south as the state of Puebla in central Mexico , with an isolated record from Honduras , probably reflecting the results of the maximum expansion achieved by the American mastodon during the Late Pleistocene .
A few isolated reports tell of mastodons being found along the east coast up to the New England region , with high concentrations in the Mid - Atlantic region .
There is strong evidence indicating that the members of Mammut were forest dwelling proboscideans , predominating in woodlands and forests , and browsed on trees and shrubs .
They apparently did not disperse southward to South America , it being speculated that this was because of a dietary specialization on a particular type of vegetation .
EXTINCTION Section::::Extinction .
Fossil evidence indicates that mastodons probably disappeared from North America about 10,500 years ago as part of a mass extinction of most of the Pleistocene megafauna that is widely believed to have been a result of human hunting pressure .
The latest Paleo - Indians entered the Americas and expanded to relatively large numbers 13,000 years ago , and their hunting may have caused a gradual attrition of the mastodon population .
Analysis of tusks of mastodons from the American Great Lakes region over a span of several thousand years prior to their extinction in the area shows a trend of declining age at maturation ; this is contrary to what one would expect if they were experiencing stresses from an unfavorable environment , but is consistent with a reduction in intraspecific competition that would result from a population being reduced by human hunting .
