HISTORY FOUNDING AND GROWTH Section::::History .
Section::::Founding and growth .
The area now known as Reseda , like much of Los Angeles County , originally was inhabited by Native Americans of the Tongva tribe who lived close to what is now known as the Los Angeles River .
In 1909 the Suburban Homes Company , a syndicate led by H. J. Whitley , general manager of the Board of Control , along with Harry Chandler , H. G. Otis , M. H. Sherman and O. F. Brandt purchased 48,000 acres of the Farming and Milling Company for $ 2,500,000 .
Henry E. Huntington , extended his Pacific Electric Railway ( Red Cars ) through the Valley to Owensmouth ( now Canoga Park ) .
The Suburban Home Company laid out plans for roads and the towns of Van Nuys , Reseda ( Marian ) and Canoga Park ( Owensmouth ) .
The rural areas were annexed into the city of Los Angeles in 1915 .
On April 2 , 1915 H. J. Whitley purchased the Suburban Home Company so that he would have complete control for finishing the development .
On land that was originally part of the San Fernando Mission , Reseda originated in 1912 as the town of Marian .
It was named after Marian Otis Chandler , the daughter of the Los Angeles Times publisher , Harrison Gray Otis and wife of Harry Chandler .
The name Reseda itself refers to the fragrant plant Reseda odorata ( English name is mignonette ) which was commonly found in gardens of the time and is native to many areas with a Mediterranean climate .
The geographic name " Reseda " was first used for a siding on a branch of the Southern Pacific Railroad , which ran between the cities of Burbank and Chatsworth in the San Fernando Valley .
In the 1920s , the name Reseda was transferred from the Southern Pacific Railroad to the Western Division of the Pacific Electric Railway " Red Cars Line " , which had expedited development after the building of the Los Angeles Aqueduct .
Later , it was used as the name of a stop on the Pacific Electric interurban railway running along Sherman Way .
Throughout this time the town 's name of Marian remained ; then in 1921 , when a Fourth Class Post Office was found to be necessary , the town 's name had to be changed .
As the Zelzah Tribune reported : The Marian territory has made application for a post office to serve that district .
To avoid confusion in mail distribution it is necessary that the name of the town be changed and the people of that community have decided upon the name Reseda , and if the application is granted it will be the only post office in the United States by that name .
Mrs. Turner , we are told , who has taken an active interest in the canvass and to create a sentiment for post office advantages , will possibly be the postmistress .
Ninety - two residents convened and agreed to rename the town Reseda .
The central business district began in 1915 , at what is now the intersection of Reseda Boulevard and Sherman Way , with the construction of a hardware store .
Soon a blacksmith shop and an auto repair garage were built nearby .
Within a short time , these were followed by a grocery store and a drug store .
There were no sidewalks or pavement yet , most were beginning to be added during the 1918 to early 1920s time period .
On the southwest corner of Sherman Way a wooden building housed the volunteer Fire Department until 1922 , when the present brick building was erected as was the Reseda Bank .
The wooden building , housing the Fire Department , was then moved to the southeast side of Sherman Way , where it remained until 1933 .
In May 1929 , the city 's namesake roadway , Reseda Avenue , was renamed Reseda Boulevard by a Los Angeles City ordinance .
Parts of the original 1920s and 1930s residential neighborhood remain and are found to the southwest of Sherman Way and Reseda Boulevard .
Reseda grew slowly .
The stock market crash of 1929 and subsequent Great Depression further slowed expansion .
During the late 1920s and 1930s , the area became widely known for its production of lettuce , lima beans , sugar beets , and walnuts ; in the late 1930s , Reseda became known as was one of the largest producers of lettuce in the United States .
The Southern Pacific Railroad trains came up the middle of Sherman Way to pick up freight cars of lettuce on a daily basis during the lettuce harvest season .
Around that time , manufacturing roof tile , canning poultry products , and processing walnuts began to emerge as viable businesses as well .
POSTWAR SUBURB Section::::Postwar suburb .
Reseda remained primarily an agricultural community with a population of 1,805 in 1930 .
However , by 1940 the population had increased to 4,147 residents .
The mid to later 1940 's saw a large increase in the numbers of single - family dwellings in Reseda and the loss of numerous acres of agriculture , and the addition of First Class Postal Service .
Reseda was one of the first suburbs in the San Fernando Valley .
The large ranches were subdivided , and the area was developed by realtors just as the veterans of World War II were returning home .
The familiar orange groves were successively plowed under in favor of housing .
At the time , most of the jobs were in the Los Angeles Basin and to the south , over the Santa Monica mountains .
By 1950 , Reseda had over 16,000 residents and in the early 1950s , a population explosion took place , making Reseda one of the most popular and populated of all Valley communities .
Because of this , Reseda 's merchants provided bus service to transport shoppers throughout the busy downtown Reseda areas .
In the early 1950s , the Valley 's population reached 400,000 .
The average new Valley home , in 1949 , cost $ 9,000 .
By 1955 , that same house could be resold for nearly $ 15,000 .
Even at that price , though , a household income was about $ 6,000 a year , making Valley incomes higher than the national average .
By 1960 , the average market value of a Valley home reached $ 18,850 .
During the 1970s , the above - average residential real estate values and income patterns compared to the rest of the country began to reverse .
Land and housing costs shot upward , while most incomes only crept .
By the beginning of the 1980s , the average price of a home in the Valley reached $ 110,000 .
According to a 2004 study by the U.S. Bureau of the Census , it has tripled that of the early 1980s .
