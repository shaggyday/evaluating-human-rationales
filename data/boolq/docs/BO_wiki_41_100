HISTORY Section::::History .
The community of Corolla began as a European development on American Indian hunting grounds .
Tribes including the Chowanoke and Poteskeet hunted along the barrier island .
The European - American town of Corolla was first called Jones Hill , after an early settler .
It was also known as Whalehead or Currituck Beach .
Early settlers made a living from fishing and hunting , as well as from salvage from shipwrecks and serving as guides to hunters .
Construction of the Currituck Beach Lighthouse resulted in a stabilization of the economy with a new influx of jobs .
Currituck was derived from an American Indian term , Carotank , meaning land of the wild geese .
On the Atlantic migratory flyway , the area at the time had a large wild geese population .
Over hunting in the late 19th century caused numbers to severely drop .
The town officially took the name Corolla in 1895 when a post office opened in the community .
The name was chosen to refer to the botanic term for the petals of a flower .
Development of Currituck 's Northern Outer Banks began in 1967 when investors from Sandbridge , Virginia , put together an investment group to purchase undeveloped land .
The first subdivision plotted was Carova with 1,993 lots .
The lots were originally priced in the early 1970s at $ 8,000 ; as of 2006 , some of these lots are worth up to $ 500,000 .
The investors planned for a road to come through from Virginia Beach , Virginia , to allow access to the lots ; however , these plans were abandoned in 1973 when the Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge south of Sandbridge was closed to all vehicular traffic , except by permit .
Development pushed south through the 1970s , creating well over 1,000 additional lots in several subdivisions .
In 1984 the residents of Corolla succeeded in their attempts to gain a public access road from the south .
The state began paving the extension of NC-12 toward the north .
In addition to the Currituck Beach Light , the Currituck Shooting Club and Whalehead Club are listed on the National Register of Historic Places .
