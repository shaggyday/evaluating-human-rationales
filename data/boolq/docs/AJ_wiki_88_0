LAGOS Lagos initially emerged as a port city that originated on a collection of islands , which are contained in the present day Local Government Areas ( LGAs ) of Lagos Island , Eti - Osa , Amuwo - Odofin and Apapa ; the islands are separated by creeks , fringing the southwest mouth of Lagos Lagoon , while protected from the Atlantic Ocean by barrier islands and long sand spits such as Bar Beach , which stretch up to east and west of the mouth .
Due to rapid urbanization , the city expanded to the west of the lagoon to include areas in the present day Lagos Mainland , Ajeromi - Ifelodun and Surulere .
This led to the classification of Lagos into two main areas : the Island , which was the initial city of Lagos , before it expanded into the area known as the Mainland .
This city area was governed directly by the Federal Government through the Lagos City Council , until the creation of Lagos State in 1967 , which led to the splitting of Lagos city into the present day seven Local Government Areas ( LGAs ) , and an addition of other towns ( which now make up 13 LGAs ) from the then Western Region , to form the state .
Lagos , the capital of Nigeria since its amalgamation in 1914 , went on to become the capital of Lagos State after its creation .
However , the state capital was later moved to Ikeja in 1976 , and the federal capital moved to Abuja in 1991 .
Even though Lagos is still widely referred to as a city , the present day Lagos , also known as " Metropolitan Lagos " , and officially as " Lagos Metropolitan Area " is an urban agglomeration or conurbation , consisting of 20 LGAs,32 LCDAs including Ikeja , the state capital of Lagos State .
This conurbation makes up 37 % of Lagos State 's total land area , but houses about 85 % of the state 's total population .
The exact population of Metropolitan Lagos is disputed .
In the 2006 federal census data , the conurbation had a population of about 8 million people .
However , the figure was disputed by the Lagos State Government , which later released its own population data , putting the population of Lagos Metropolitan Area at approximately 16 million .
As at 2015 , unofficial figures put the population of " Greater Metropolitan Lagos " , which includes Lagos and its surrounding metro area , extending as far as into Ogun State , at approximately 21 million .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Lagos was originally inhabited by the Awori subgroup of the Yoruba people in the 15th century .
Under the leadership of the Oloye Olofin , the Awori moved to an island now called Iddo and then to the larger Lagos Island .
In the 16th century , the Awori settlement was conquered by the Benin Empire and the island became a Benin war - camp called " Eko " under Oba Orhogbua , the Oba of Benin at the time .
Eko is still the native name for Lagos .
Lagos , which means " lakes " , was a name given to the settlement by the Portuguese .
The present - day Lagos state has a high percentage of Awori clan , who migrated to the area from Isheri along the Ogun river .
Throughout history , it was home to a number of warring ethnic groups who had settled in the area .
Following its early settlement by the Awori nobility , and its conquest by the Bini warlords of Benin , the state first came to the attention of the Portuguese in the 15th century .
Portuguese explorer Rui de Sequeira visited the area in 1472 , naming the area around the city Lago de Curamo .
Another explanation is that Lagos was named for Lagos , Portugal — a maritime town that , at the time , was the main centre of Portuguese expeditions down the African coast .
In Britain 's early 19th century fight against the transatlantic slave trade , its West Africa Squadron or Preventative Squadron as it was also known , continued to pursue Portuguese , American , French and Cuban slave ships and to impose anti - slavery treaties with West African coastal chiefs with so much doggedness that they created a strong presence along the West African coast from Sierra Leone all the way to the Niger Delta ( today 's Nigeria ) and as far south as Congo .
In 1849 , Britain appointed John Beecroft Consul of the Bights of Benin and Biafra , a position he held ( along with his governorship of Fernando Po ) until his death in 1854 .
John Duncan was appointed Vice Consul and was located at Wydah .
At the time of Beecroft 's appointment , the Kingdom of Lagos ( under Oba Kosoko ) was in the western part of the Consulate of the Bights of Benin and Biafra and was a key slave trading port .
In 1851 and with pressure from liberated slaves who now wielded political and business influence , Britain intervened in Lagos in what is now known as the Bombardment of Lagos or Capture of Lagos resulting in the installation of Oba Akitoye and the ouster of Oba Kosoko .
Oba Akitoye then signed the Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos abolishing slavery .
The signing of the 1852 treaty ushered in the Consular Period in Lagos ' history wherein Britain provided military protection to Lagos .
Following threats from Kosoko and the French who were positioned at Wydah , a decision was made by Lord Palmerston ( British Prime Minister ) who noted in 1861 , " the expediency of losing no time in assuming the formal Protectorate of Lagos " .
William McCoskry , the Acting Consul in Lagos with Commander Bedingfield convened a meeting with Oba Dosunmu on 30 July 1861 aboard HMS Prometheus where Britain 's intent was explained and a response to the terms were required by August 1861 .
Dosunmu resisted the terms of the treaty but under the threat to unleash violence on Lagos by Commander Bedingfield , Dosunmu relented and signed the Lagos Treaty of Cession on 6 August 1861 .
Lagos was declared a colony on 5 March 1862 .
The remainder of modern - day Nigeria was seized in 1887 , and when the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria was established in 1914 , Lagos became its capital , continuing as such after the country 's independence from Britain in 1960 .
Along with migrants from all over Nigeria and other West African nations were the returnee ex - slaves known as Creoles , who came from Freetown , Sierra Leone , Brazil and the West Indies to Lagos .
The Creoles contributed to Lagos ' modernisation and their knowledge of Portuguese architecture can still be seen from the architecture on Lagos Island .
Since the 19th century , Lagos gradually transformed to a melting pot of Africans and Europeans .
Railway links and telephone cables connecting Lagos to London had been established by 1886 .
Electric street lighting was introduced in the city in 1898 .
Lagos experienced rapid growth throughout the 1960s and 1970s as a result of Nigeria 's economic boom .
Before the creation of Lagos State on 27 May 1967 , Lagos , which was the country 's capital had been administered directly by the Federal Government as a Federal Territory through the Federal Ministry of Lagos Affairs , while the Lagos City Council ( LCC ) governed the city .
Lagos , along with the towns from the then Western region ( Ikeja , Agege , Mushin , Ikorodu , Epe and Badagry ) , were eventually captured to create Lagos State .
Lagos city was split into the present day seven Local Government Areas ( LGAs ) , while the other towns now make up 13 LGAs in the state .
Lagos played the dual role of being the State and Federal Capital until 1976 when the state capital was moved to Ikeja .
Lagos was adversely affected during Nigeria 's military rule .
Also , on 12 December 1991 , the seat of the Federal Government was also formally relocated to Abuja .
However , Lagos still remains the financial centre of the country , and also grew to become the most populous conurbation in the country .
GEOGRAPHY
Section::::Geography .
Lagos is loosely classified into two main geographical areas — the " Island " and the " Mainland " .
CITYSCAPE ISLAND Section::::Cityscape .
Section::::Island .
The Island is a loose geographical term that is used to define the area of Lagos that is separated from the " mainland " by the main channel draining the lagoon into the Atlantic Ocean , which forms Lagos Harbour .
The Island is mainly a collection of islands that are separated from each other by creeks of varying sizes and are connected together by bridges .
The smaller sections of some creeks have been dredged and built over .
This part of Lagos is the area where most business activities and entertainment events in Lagos takes place .
It also houses most of the upscale residential areas in Lagos .
The Local Government areas that are considered to be in the Island include Lagos Island , Amuwo - Odofin , Apapa ( sometimes also regarded as being on the mainland ) , and Eti - Osa .
The major upscale island neighbourhoods within these LGAs include Ikoyi and Victoria Island .
Three major bridges join the island to the mainland .
They are the Carter Bridge , which starts from Iddo ; the Eko Bridge ( formerly called the Second Mainland Bridge ) ; and the Third Mainland Bridge , which passes through densely populated mainland suburbs to the Lagos Lagoon .
LAGOS ISLAND Section::::Lagos Island .
Lagos Island contains a central business district .
This district is characterised by high - rise buildings .
The island also contains many of the city 's largest wholesale marketplaces ( such as the popular Idumota and Balogun Markets ) .
It also has the National Museum of Nigeria , the Central Mosque , the Glover Memorial Hall , Christ 's Church Cathedral ( CMS ) and the Oba 's Palace ( Iga Idunganran ) .
Another major part of Lagos Island is Marina .
It borders around the idumota and Balogun markets and houses major Banking institutions .
Though formerly in a derelict condition , Lagos Island 's Tinubu Square is a site of historical importance ; it was here that the Amalgamation Ceremony that unified the North and South protectorate to form Nigeria took place in 1914 .
IKOYI
Section::::Ikoyi .
Ikoyi is situated on the eastern half of Lagos Island and joined to it by a land fill .
Ikoyi is also connected to Victoria Island by Falomo bridge , which carries a main road over Five Cowrie creek .
Ikoyi housed the headquarters of the federal government of Nigeria and other buildings owned by the government , including the old federal secretariat complex .
The complex today is on reestablishment .
In Ikoyi there are military and police barracks , a top - security prison and a federal high court of Nigeria .
Ikoyi also has a number of hotels , night clubs , a recreational park and one of Africa 's largest golf courses .
Originally a middle class neighbourhood , in recent years , it has become a fashionable residential enclave for the upper middle class to the upper class .
There are also commercial activities in Ikoyi , which is spotted in increasing number of offices , banks , and shopping complexes .
The commercial section is concentrated in the South - West .
VICTORIA ISLAND Section::::Victoria Island .
Victoria Island with its annexe is situated to the south of Lagos Island .
It has expensive real estate properties and for that reason , many new luxury condos and apartments are blooming up everywhere .
Along with Ikoyi , Victoria Island occupies a major area in Lagos that boasts of several sizeable shopping districts .
On its sea shore along the Atlantic front , there is environmentally reconstructed Bar Beach .
IDDO Section::::Iddo .
Across the main channel of the lagoon from Lagos Island , there is a smaller settlement called Iddo .
Iddo is also a railroad terminus and it is now situated in the Lagos Mainland local government area after it was connected to the mainland like a peninsula .
MAINLAND Section::::Mainland .
A huge population of Lagosians also live on the Lagos mainland , and most industries are located there .
The mainland is known for its music and nightlife , which used to be located in areas around Yaba and Surulere .
However , in recent years more night clubs have sprung up on the Island , making the Island ( particularly Victoria Island and Lekki Phase 1 ) the main nightlife attractions .
Mainland LGAs include Surulere , Ajeromi - Ifelodun and Lagos Mainland .
Metropolitan Lagos suburban LGAs include : Agege , Apapa , Mushin , Oshodi - Isolo and Ikeja ( site of Murtala Muhammed International Airport and the capital of Lagos State ) .
Major Areas on the mainland include Ebute Metta , Yaba and Ejigbo .
Some rivers , like Badagry Creek , flow parallel to the coast for some distance before exiting through the sand bars to the sea .
ARCHITECTURE
Section::::Architecture .
Lagos has the tallest skyline in Nigeria .
The architectural styles in Lagos are diverse and ranges from tropical , vernacular to colonial European and ultramodern buildings or a mixture .
Brazilian style architecture brought by the creoles is evident in buildings such as Water House and Shitta Bey Mosque .
Skyscrapers and most high rise buildings are centered on the islands while the mainland has some high rise buildings .
In recent years , the Lagos State government has renovated existing parks and green areas , with a long term goal of expansion .
Many good quality buildings are interspersed across the city .
CLIMATE Section::::Climate .
Lagos experiences a tropical savanna climate ( Aw ) according to the Köppen climate classification , as there 's a significant precipitation difference between the wet season and the dry season .
The wet season starts in April and ends in October , while the dry season starts in November and ends in March .
The wettest month is June with precipitation total , while the driest month is January with precipitation total .
Located near the equator , Lagos has only a slight seasonal temperature variation , with high temperatures ranging .
Lagos shares the seasons of the Southern Hemisphere , with summer highs in March , daily range , and warm winters in August , ranging as the daily average .
ADMINISTRATION AND DEMOGRAPHICS Section::::Administration and demographics .
In terms of administration , Lagos is not a single municipality and therefore has no overall city administration .
The geographical city limits of Metropolitan Lagos comprises 16 of the 20 Local Government Areas , which together comprise Lagos State .
The latter entity provides overall government for the metropolitan region .
The Municipality of Lagos , which covered Lagos Island , Ikoyi , and Victoria Island as well as some mainland territory , was managed by the Lagos City Council ( LCC ) , but it was disbanded in 1976 and divided into several Local Government Areas ( most notably Lagos Island LGA , Lagos Mainland LGA and Eti - Osa LGA ) .
The mainland beyond the Municipality of Lagos , on the other hand , comprised several separate towns and settlements such as Mushin , Ikeja and Agege .
In the wake of the 1970s Nigerian oil boom , Lagos experienced a population explosion , untamed economic growth , and unmitigated rural migration .
This caused the outlying towns and settlements to develop rapidly , thus forming the present day " Lagos Metropolitan Area " , also known as " Metropolitan Lagos " .
The history of Lagos is still evidenced in the layout of the LGAs that display the unique identities of the cultures that created them .
By 2006 , the metro area around Lagos had extended beyond Lagos State 's boundaries and attained a megacity status .
This much larger area is referred to as " Greater Metropolitan Lagos " or " Lagos Megacity Region " , which is a continuous built up land area of additional , comprising sprawls in LGAs situated next to Lagos ' eastern and western city limits in Lagos State , and beyond northern limits , spilling into the LGAs in adjoining Ogun State .
Ogun State LGAs within Greater Metropolitan Lagos majorly include :
Obafemi Owode , Sagamu , Ifo , Ado - Odo / Ota and part of EwekoroAbuja .
Abuja officially gained its status as the capital of Nigeria on 12 December 1991 , although the decision to move the federal capital had been made in now Act no . 6 of 1976 .
Lagos is also home to the High Court of the Lagos State Judiciary , housed in an old colonial building on Lagos Island .
CENSUS DATA FOR LAGOS
Section::::Census data for Lagos .
Although the 2006 National Population Census of Nigeria credited the metropolitan area with a population figure of 7,937,932 , the figure is at variance with some projections by the UN and other population agencies and groups worldwide .
The population figure of Lagos State given by the Lagos State Government is 17,553,924 .
It was based on claimed conducted enumeration for social planning by the Lagos State Government " parallel census " and it believes that since the inhabitants of the metropolitan area of Lagos constitute 88 % of the Lagos State population , the population of metropolitan Lagos is about 15.5 million .
A rejoinder to Lagos State Government views concluded that Lagos State concealed the fact that the population projection , for Lagos Urban Agglomeration by the UN agencies had been revised downwards substantially as early as 2003 .
It failed to interpret the two most important and fairly representative and reliable secondary data sets already in public domain , the National Identity Card Scheme and the 2003 Voters Registration figures from INEC .
The figures for 2007 Voters Registration by INEC were an act subsequent to the release of the provisional census results and comprehensively corroborate , vindicate and validate the population figures in no uncertain terms .
According to the official results of the 2006 census , there were 8,048,430 inhabitants in Metropolitan Lagos .
This figure was lower than anticipated , and has created controversy in Nigeria .
Lagos Island , the central Local Government Area and historic centre of Metropolitan Lagos , had a population of 212,700 at the 2006 Census .
Authorities of Lagos State have attacked the results of the 2006 census , accusing the Nigerian National Population Commission of having undercounted the population of the state .
This accusation is denied by the National Population Commission .
A study found that research carried out by Africapolis ( the African subsidiary of e - Geopolis backed by the Agence française de développement ) , in addition to the cross - referencing of official figures with more scientific independent research concluded that the 2006 census figures for Lagos State of about 9 million were valid and that the state 's own assessments are inflated .
Lagos is , by most estimates , one of the fastest - growing cities in the world .
Lagos is currently experiencing a population increase of about 275,000 persons per annum .
In 1999 the United Nations predicted that the city 's metropolitan area , which had only about 290,000 inhabitants in 1950 , would exceed 20 million by 2010 and thus become one of the ten most populated cities in the world .
There is a huge spectrum of wealth distribution among the people that reside in Lagos .
It ranges from the very wealthy to the very poor .
Lagos has attracted many young people and families seeking a better life from all other parts of Nigeria and beyond and this has also contributed to its cosmopolitan status .

Lagos is also the major Information Communications and Telecommunications ( ICT ) hub of West Africa and potentially , the biggest ICT market in the continent .
Lagos is developing a 24-hour economy and has also been ranked as one of the most expensive cities in the world .
In some parts of Lagos , residents have one of the highest standards of living in Nigeria and in Africa .
At the same time , a sizable proportion of the residents live in slums without access to piped water and sanitation .
The Port of Lagos is Nigeria 's leading port and one of the largest and busiest in Africa .
It is administered by the Nigerian Ports Authority and it is split into three main sections : Lagos port , in the main channel next to Lagos Island , Apapa Port ( site of the container terminal ) and Tin Can Port , both located in Badagry Creek , which flows into Lagos Harbour from the west .
The port features a railhead .
The port has seen growing amounts of crude oil exported , with export figures rising between 1997 and 2000 .
Oil and petroleum products provide 14 % of GDP and 90 % of foreign exchange earnings in Nigeria as a whole .

The Lagos healthcare system is generally divided into public and private sectors that provide medical services at the primary , secondary , and tertiary levels .
Although the private hospitals are usually more expensive , it does not necessarily translate to better health - care delivery .
TRANSPORTATION HIGHWAYS Section::::Transportation .
Section::::Highways .
Lagos has one of the largest and most extensive road networks in West Africa .
It also has suburban trains and some ferry services .
Highways are usually congested in peak hours , due in part to the geography of the city , as well as to its explosive population growth .
Lagos is also linked by many highways and bridges .
A new rail system that is supposed to span the length of the Badagry expressway is currently under construction .
The Lagos – Ibadan Expressway and the Lagos –
Abeokuta Expressway are the major controlled - access highways in the north of the city and serve as inter - state highways to Oyo State and Ogun State respectively .
To the west the congested Lagos – Badagry Expressway serves outlying towns such as Festival Town , which was the location for the 1977 Festival of Black Arts and Culture 77 .
Lagos 's importance as a commercial centre and port and its strategic location have led to it being the end - point of three Trans - African Highway routes using Nigeria 's national roads .
The Trans – West African Coastal Highway leaves the city as the Badagry Expressway to Benin and beyond as far as Dakar and Nouakchott ; the Trans - Sahara Highway to Algiers , which is close to completion , leaves the city as the Lagos - Ibadan Expressway .
Lagos State has a bus rapid transit ( BRT ) system ; the first phase was completed in February 2008 .
It is expected to operate along eight routes using specially designated bus rapid transit lanes running through the city , with the aim of expanding to other routes in the future .
The first phase of the Lagos BRT runs through Ikorodu Road and Funsho Williams Avenue up to CMS .
After weeks of test runs , operations started on 17 March 2008 , six months earlier than planned .
Also , the signature color of Lagos state 14-seater bus ( known as Danfo ) is yellow with a touch of black .
It has been estimated that the system will transport about 10,000 passengers in each direction per hour during peak travel times .
At these times traffic congestion , called " Go Slow " , by Lagosians , can be extreme .
The LAMATA bus rapid transit corridor covers a distance of about .
The system is run by two operators , NURTW Cooperative ( Nigerian Union of Road Transport Workers ) and Lagbus , a Lagos State Government owned Asset Management Company that contributes about 180 high - capacity buses for the implementation of the first phase Mile 12 to CMS BRT Lite system .

The airport had been known simply as the Lagos International Airport .
It was however , re - named for the late Nigerian Head of State , General Murtala Muhammed , who died in 1976 .
The airport terminal has been renovated several times since the 1970s but its most radical make over began in 2013 , following the launch of the Federal government 's multi - billion naira Remodelling/ Rehabilitation Programme for its airports nationwide .
Under the re - modelling work there , by late in 2014 , the MMlA lounge area had been expanded to four times its previous size and new passenger handling conveyor systems installed which can handle over 1,000 passengers per hour .
