RESTAURANTS Section::::History .
Section::::Tricon Global Restaurants .
Yum ! was created on May 30 , 1997 , as Tricon Global Restaurants , Inc. from PepsiCo 's fast food division as the parent corporation of KFC , Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurant companies .
Tricon Global was spun out in October 1997 .
Tricon selected Louisville as its headquarters , moving near the KFC Restaurant Support Centers from the Pepsi HQ in Purchase , New York , by early 1998 .
In 2000 , Tricon Global agreed to test multi - branded locations with Lexington , Kentucky - based Yorkshire Global Restaurants , owner of the Long John Silver 's and A&W chains .
By March 2002 , the Tricon - Yorkshire multibranding test consisted of 83 KFC / A&Ws , six KFC / Long John Silver 's and three Taco
Bell / Long John Silver 's and was considered successful by the companies .
In 2001 , KFC started test restaurants in Austin , Texas , called " Wing Works " , which is a chicken wing line sold with one of a few flavored sauces .

In March 2002 , Tricon announced the acquisition of Yorkshire and its intention to change the company 's name to Yum !
Brands , Inc. to match its NYSE ticker symbol .
The name change became effective after a vote during the company 's annual shareholders meeting by May 22 , 2002 while the acquisition was finalized on May 8th .
On June 6 , 2002 , Yum ! executed a two - for - one stock split .
Shortly afterwards , due to Yum ! 's lifetime contract with Pepsi , Long John Silver 's and A&W ( both of which previously served Coca - Cola products ) began switching to Pepsi products , with A&W Restaurants retaining A&W Root Beer from a separate deal with Dr Pepper / Seven Up ( now Dr Pepper Snapple Group ) .
In 2002 , Yum ! began testing co - branding locations pairing Pizza Hut with Pasta Bravo , Back Yard Burgers and A&W. The Pasta Bravo concept was acquired in 2003 from Pasta Bravo , Inc. of Aliso Viejo , California for $ 5 million to pair with Pizza Hut .
In 2003 , Yum ! launched WingStreet as a hybrid combo unit with an existing Pizza Hut franchise .
In 2007 and 2008 , a thousand WingStreet stores a year were opened .
An East Dawning test cafeteria - style restaurant was opened in Shanghai in 2004 .
After initially failing , Yum !
Brands chose the KFC business model ( KFC is the most successful Western chain in China ) and found greater success .
As of September 30 , 2007 , eight East Dawning restaurants were in operation .
INTERNATIONAL FOCUS Section::::International focus .
In January 2011 , Yum ! announced its intentions to divest itself of its Long John Silver 's and A&W brands to focus on its core brands of KFC , Pizza Hut , Taco Bell , and WingStreet .
For the decade leading up to the company 's announcement , major growth had relied on international expansion .
With little presence outside North America , the two chains no longer fit in the company 's long - term growth plans .
The foreign expansion — particularly that of WingStreet , Taco Bell , Pizza Hut , and KFC — was cited in the firm 's January 18 , 2011 , announcement of its intention to sell the A&W and Long John Silver 's chains .
Both of those chains also suffered from poor sales , and had fewer locations compared to the other chains in the Yum !
Brands portfolio .
In September 2011 , Yum ! announced they had found buyers for the A&W and LJS chains .
A Great American Brand will buy A&W , and LJS will be acquired by LJS Partners LLC .
In 2009 , Yum ! paid approximately $ 103 million to purchase 27 % stake in Chinese hot pot chain Little Sheep .
On May 12 , 2011,Yum made a pre - conditional cash offer to acquire additional 66 % of Little Sheep for approximately $ 570 million .
The deal spent more than 4 months in anti - trust review by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce , to determine whether or not the transaction would result in a monopolistic positioning of Yum !
in the country 's restaurant industry .
The Ministry approved the deal in November 2011 , according to Little Sheep representatives .
In 2012 , a KFC opened in Ramallah and became the first American fast food restaurant to operate in the West Bank ; a Pizza Hut is also planned .
In 2013 , a few KFC locations in China supplied chicken found to contain " excess levels of chemical residue " .
Yum ! has lost 6 % of sales from publicity in China as of January 25 .
The company opened its first restaurant in Ulaanbaatar , Mongolia , in May 2013 .
For Mongolia , KFC is the first western fast food to open its doors in the country .
The company is planning to open 15 more restaurants in Ulaanbaatar in the next 5 years , including the country 's first drive - thru service .

Brands has also opened Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurants in newer Target stores .
Yum !
Brands opened its 40,000th store in Calangute , Goa , India in October 2013 .
In 2013 , its KFC subsidiary opened a fast casual version , KFC eleven , test location in Louisville on Bardstown Road .
In the third quarter of 2013 , Yum !
Brands had to book an impairment of the goodwill resulting from the takeover of Little Sheep in 2011 in the amount of $ 222 million , which reduced profits for 2013 .
In 2014 , Yum ! launched a number of additional restaurant test concepts , Super Chix , U.S. Taco Co. and Banh Shop .
Yum !
opened Super Chix in Central Arlington , Texas that is similar in format to Chick - fil - A on April 9 , 2014 .
In the summer of 2014 , Yum ! 's Taco Bell subsidiary launched its U.S. Taco Co and Urban Tap Room fast - casual taco concept restaurant in Huntington Beach , California , to take on fast casual restaurants like Chipotle and Panera .
In the first quarter of 2015 , Third Point Management and Corvex Management separately acquired an unspecified stake in the company .
