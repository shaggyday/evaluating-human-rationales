SYNOPSIS
Section::::Synopsis .
The book narrates Cahalan 's issues with anti - NMDA receptor encephalitis and the process by which she was diagnosed with this form of encephalitis .
She wakes up in a hospital with no memory of the events of the previous month , during which time she would have violent episodes and delusions .
Her eventual diagnosis is made more difficult by various physicians misdiagnosing her with several theories such as " partying too much " and schizoaffective disorder .
Eventually several physicians , including Dr. Souhel Najjar , began to suspect that Cahalan was suffering from an autoimmune disease .
Najjar diagnosed Cahalan using a test that involved her drawing a clock , a test normally given to people suspected of having dementia or Alzheimer 's disease .
Rather than drawing the clock face normally , the disease caused Cahalan to draw all of the numbers 1 through 12 on the right face of the clock , because the right side of her brain , which regulates the left side of the body , was inflamed .
Najjar used this to help diagnose Cahalan and start her road to recovery .
The book also covers Cahalan 's life after her recovery , including her reactions to watching videotapes of her psychotic episodes while in the hospital .
Cahalan also discusses her symptoms prior to her hospitalization , as she had previously been diagnosed by a psychiatrist with bipolar disorder .
While researching , she learned that the disease had only been discovered three years before she became ill .
Her research indicated that in 2009 most people with the disease were either misdiagnosed or undiagnosed .
Cahalan was fortunate to be correctly diagnosed because , according to Najjar 's estimates , only 10 percent of people with the disease were properly diagnosed at that time .
Since then , a better understanding of the disease and its symptoms has resulted in more frequent diagnosis and treatment .
RECEPTION Section::::Reception .
Critical reception for Brain on Fire has been mostly positive .
