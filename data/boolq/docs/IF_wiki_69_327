POUNDWORLD
Poundworld was a British value variety store that sold most of its items for £ 1 .
The chain was founded in 1974 by Yorkshire - based father - and - son team Chris Edwards Sr . and
Chris Edwards Jr. In contrast to many high street retailers , Poundworld maintained strong sales and growth during the global recession that started in 2007 .
Poundworld 's product range consisted of over 6,000 items including groceries , health and beauty , toiletries , cleaning products and pet care , some of them known brands .
At its peak it had 335 stores in England , Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland .
In 2014 , it was planning to open 150 new stores within three years .
Its larger rival in the market was Poundland .
A series on BBC One entitled Pound Shop Wars , broadcast between 2012 and 2015 , concerned Poundworld and its rivals .
As well as all of its £ 1 lines , Poundworld introduced a range of multi - price products across its estate of stores in 2017 to offer customers ' More Choice , More Savings ' .
Suffering intense competition from the addition of multi - price products , combined with difficulties arising from the weak pound , Poundworld entered administration in June 2018 .
Closing sales began in stores late that month .
In July 2018 , Poundworld confirmed that all stores were to close by 10 August 2018 after rescue talks with original founder Chris Edwards failed .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The chain originated in 1974 , when Chris Edwards Sr . set up a market stall in his home town of Wakefield .
He initially set up a multi - price store called " Bargain Centre " , before switching to a single - price format in 1997 , trading as " Everything 's £ 1 " .
Since the recession that started in 2007 , Poundworld has expanded rapidly .
Its sales grew by 42 % between 2010 and 2011 , and increased by 55 % , with revenues of £ 200 m , in 2012 .
Its expansion meant that the company required larger premises , and it relocated its head offices to the largest unit in Yorkshire 's main warehousing and distribution base .
It also opened an overseas office in Shanghai during this period .
In October 2013 , Poundworld partnered with the Marie Curie Cancer Care charity , which it had already supported during 2013 's Great Daffodil Appeal .
To date , the company has raised in excess of £ 900,000 to help care for those ( and their families ) living with a terminal illness .
In November 2013 , Poundworld opened its first multi - price retail store , in Walsall , under the name Bargain Buys .
Bargain Buys was originally named ( and briefly traded as ) Discount UK , with the name change allowing the chain to compete more closely with its rivals in the market .
The company planned to open a further 100 stores in the next three years .
In July 2014 , the store secured a £ 26 m loan from Santander to finance its stated aim of increasing its approximately 240 stores by 40 or 50 a year for the next three years , and to strengthen its overseas supply chain from where about 30 % of its supplies are sourced .
The Edwards ( father and son ) were placed at Number 12 in Management Todays annual list of Britain 's Top 100 Entrepreneurs in October 2014 .
In the same month , Poundworld Retail was named one of the United Kingdom 's fastest growing retailers in the Sunday Times Grant Thornton Top Track 250 .
On 15 May 2015 , the company announced that it had sold a majority stake in the business to private equity firm TPG Capital for £ 150 million , with Christopher Edwards , his son , and other senior executives retaining a substantial minority holding , allowing the family to retain the day - to - day running of the business .
Poundworld announced that the investment from TPG would allow the business to grow , with further plans for store expansion .
Shortly after the deal , the company announced that it had begun construction of a new distribution centre in Normanton as part of a plan to create 4,000 jobs , and hoped to open a further 200 new stores in the next three years .
In early 2018 TPG proposed to put the company through a Company Voluntary Arrangement ( CVA ) to restructure the business by closing around 100 of its existing 355 stores .
However , during the process , TPG was approached by third parties interested in buying the company ; it agreed in May 2018 to put the CVA process on hold , and to look at a sale .
In June 2018 Alteri Investors pulled out of talks to buy Poundworld .
On 20 July 2018 , it was confirmed that all Poundworld stores were to close by 10 August .

In May 2012 , the company launched a wholesale website , targeted at market traders , eBay sellers and independent retailers .

The company followed this in February 2014 by launching a retail online pound store named poundshop.com .
Poundworld supplied stock and product images for the single price website – the first of its kind .
However , Poundworld decided to leave the project after six months , citing " a failure to reach a shared vision " with Smith .
It launched another online shop in April 2015 :
Poundworld Plus , offering over 4,000 products , all at £ 1 .
It later changed the website name to Poundworld.co.uk .

In November 2014 , the company started selling a range of merchandise relating to Disney 's film Frozen .
At Poundworld 's new store opening in Merthyr Tydfil in October , people waited for over an hour before it opened ; fights broke out as stocks ran low .
There were similar crowds at the new Nottingham store in November .
ASA RULING
ON SLOGAN Section::::ASA ruling on slogan .
In October 2014 , The Advertising Standards Authority ( ASA ) ruled that Poundworld 's " Everything £ 1 " slogan was misleading , as some items were priced at up to £ 8.99 .

POUND SHOP WARS
Section::::Pound Shop Wars .
In 2012 , the company was the subject of a BBC documentary series , Pound Shop Wars , that focused on the competition between Poundworld and its rivals .
After the initial hour - long pilot , the four - episode series was broadcast at the beginning of 2014 .
A second series of eight episodes was screened in autumn 2015 .
ADMINISTRATION Section::::Administration .
After rescue talks with potential buyer R Capital failed , the company entered administration on 11 June 2018 , the same day that electrical retailer Maplin became defunct .
The administrators , Deloitte , continued to run the business as normal .
On 19 June 2018 , one hundred staff from the company 's head office were made redundant .
A day later , the company began closing down sales at all of its over 300 stores , although they stated that no stores were " definitely " closing .
A further 20 head office staff were made redundant on 29 June 2018 .
After much speculation in the media , it emerged that the founder , Chris Edwards , was in talks to rescue the struggling business , but that there were bitter divisions between Edwards and the administrators , Deloitte .
The discussions appeared to come to a sudden conclusion on 5 July 2018 , when it was reported that Edwards ' bid had been rejected , placing the future of the business in fresh doubt .
On 10 July 2018 , Deloitte confirmed that 25 of the troubled retailer 's stores would formally close .
The last day of trading for these stores was to be 15 July 2018 , resulting in the loss of a reported 242 jobs .
A few days after this announcement , it was confirmed that another 80 stores would close , resulting in the loss of around 1,024 jobs .
The 80 affected stores were to close on 22 July 2018 .
On 17 July 2018 , it was revealed a further 40 stores would be closing costing another 531 jobs ; the affected 40 stores were to close on 24 July 2018 .
It was revealed on 19 July 2018 that the remaining 190 stores were to close on 10 August 2018 , costing 2,339 jobs ; after this date all 335 stores would be closed and Poundworld would cease to exist in the UK .
