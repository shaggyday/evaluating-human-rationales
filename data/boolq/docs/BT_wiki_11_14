HISTORY Section::::History .
' Project ' was an MS - DOS software application originally written in Microsoft ' C ' ( and some assembly ) language for the IBM PC .
The idea originated from the vision of Ron Bredehoeft , a former IBM S / E and PC - enthusiast in the early 1980s , to express the recipe and all preparation for a breakfast of eggs Benedict in project management terms .
Mr. Bredehoeft formed Microsoft Application Services ( MAS ) during the birth of the application and the company later entered an OEM agreement with Microsoft Corporation .
Alan M. Boyd , Microsoft 's Manager of Product Development , introduced the application as an internal tool to help manage the huge number of software projects that were in development at any time inside the company .
Boyd wrote the specification and engaged a local Seattle company to develop the prototype .
The first commercial version of Project was released for DOS in 1984 .
Microsoft bought all rights to the software in 1985 and released version 2 .
Version 3 for DOS was released in 1986 .
Version 4 for DOS was the final DOS version , released in 1986 .
The first Windows version was released in 1990 , and was labelled version 1 for Windows .
In 1991 a Macintosh version was released .
Development continued until Microsoft Project 4.0 for Mac in 1993 .
Microsoft Project 4 for the Mac included both 68k and PowerMac versions , Visual Basic for Applications and integration with Microsoft office 4.2 for the Mac .
In 1994 , Microsoft stopped development of most of its Mac applications and did not offer a new version of Office until 1998 , after the creation of the new Microsoft Macintosh Business Unit the year prior .
The Mac Business Unit never released an updated version of Project , and the last version does not run natively on Mac OS X. Microsoft Project 1.0 was the only version to support Windows 2.x .
Microsoft Project 3.0 was the last to support Windows 3.0 .
Microsoft Project 4.0 was the first to use common Office menus , and the last to support Windows 3.1x , Windows NT 3.1 and 3.5 .
It was the last 16-bit version .
Microsoft Project 95 was the first 32-bit version and it was designed for Windows 95 , hence the name .
Microsoft Project 98 was the first to use Tahoma font in the menu bars and to contain Office Assistant , like all Office 97 applications .
Additionally it was the first version to use VBA macro language .
It was the last version to run on Windows NT 3.51 .
Project 98 SR-1 was a major service release addressing several issues in Project 98 .
Microsoft Project 2000 was the first to use personalized menus and to use Windows Installer - based setup interface , like all Office 2000 applications , and introduced Microsoft Project Central ( later renamed Microsoft Project Server ) .
Project 2000 was also the last version to run on Windows 95 .
Project 2000 SR-1 fixed several bugs .
Microsoft Project 2002 was the first to contain mandatory product activation , like Office XP and Windows XP .
It was also the last version to run on Windows NT 4.0 , 98 ( SE ) and ME .
It was available in two editions for the first time , Standard and Professional .
Microsoft Project 2003 was the first to contain Windows XP - style icons , like all Office 2003 applications , and the last to contain Office Assistant and to run on Windows 2000 .
Microsoft Project 2007 was the last to contain the menu bar and toolbars .
Office Assistant was removed entirely .

Microsoft Project 2016 is the last to support Windows 7 and Windows 8(.1 )
Microsoft Project 2019 runs only on Windows 10 , and it contains features carried over from Office 365 .
Versions for Windows were released in 1990 ( v1.0 ) , 1992 ( v3.0 ) , 1993 ( v4.0 ) , 1995
( Project 95 , v4.1a ) ,
Project 98 ( v8.0 ) , Project 98
SR-1 ( 1999 ) ,

There was no Version 2 on the Windows platform ; the original design spec was augmented with the addition of macro capabilities and the extra work required to support a macro language pushed the development schedule out to early 1992 ( Version 3 ) .
FEATURES Section::::Features .
Project creates budgets based on assignment work and resource rates .
As resources are assigned to tasks and assignment work estimated , the program calculates the cost , equal to the work times the rate , which rolls up to the task level and then to any summary tasks and finally to the project level .
Resource definitions ( people , equipment and materials ) can be shared between projects using a shared resource pool .
Each resource can have its own calendar , which defines what days and shifts a resource is available .
Resource rates are used to calculate resource assignment costs which are rolled up and summarized at the resource level .
Each resource can be assigned to multiple tasks in multiple plans and each task can be assigned multiple resources , and the application schedules task work based on the resource availability as defined in the resource calendars .
All resources can be defined in label without limit .
Therefore , it can not determine how many finished products can be produced with a given amount of raw materials .
This makes Microsoft Project unsuitable for solving problems of available materials constrained production .
Additional software is necessary to manage a complex facility that produces physical goods .
The application creates critical path schedules , and critical chain and event chain methodology third - party add - ons also are available .
Schedules can be resource leveled , and chains are visualized in a Gantt chart .
Additionally , Microsoft Project can recognize different classes of users .
These different classes of users can have differing access levels to projects , views , and other data .
Custom objects such as calendars , views , tables , filters , and fields are stored in an enterprise global which is shared by all users .
EDITIONS
