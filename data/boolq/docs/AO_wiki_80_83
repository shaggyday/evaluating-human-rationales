PROCYONIDAE Procyonidae is a New World family of the order Carnivora .
It comprises the raccoons , coatis , kinkajous , olingos , olinguitos , ringtails , and cacomistles .
Procyonids inhabit a wide range of environments and are generally omnivorous .
CHARACTERISTICS Section::::Characteristics .
Procyonids are relatively small animals , with generally slender bodies and long tails ( though the common raccoon tends to be bulky ) .
Because of their general build , the Procyonidae are often popularly viewed as smaller cousins of the bear family .
This is apparent in their German names : a raccoon is called a Waschbär ( washing bear , as he " washes " his food before eating ) , a coati is a Nasenbär ( nose - bear ) , while a kinkajou is a Honigbär ( honey - bear ) .
Dutch follows suit , calling the animals wasbeer , neusbeer and rolstaartbeer respectively .
However , it is now believed that procyonids are more closely related to mustelids than to bears .
Due to their omnivorous diet , procyonids have lost some of the adaptations for flesh - eating found in their carnivorous relatives .
While they do have carnassial teeth , these are poorly developed in most species , especially the raccoons .
Apart from the kinkajou , procyonids have the dental formula : for a total of 40 teeth .
The kinkajou has one less premolar in each row : for a total of 36 teeth .
While coatis are diurnal , all other procyonids are nocturnal .
They are mostly solitary animals ; mothers generally raises litters of up to four young on their own .
EVOLUTION Section::::Evolution .
Procyonid fossils once believed to belong to the genus Bassariscus , which includes the modern ringtail and cacomistle , have been identified from the Miocene epoch , around 20 million years ( Ma ) ago .
It has been suggested that early procyonids were an offshoot of the canids that adapted to a more omnivorous diet .
The recent evolution of procyonids has been centered on Central America ( where their diversity is greatest ) ; they invaded the formerly isolated South America as part of the Great American Interchange , beginning about 7.3 Ma ago in the late Miocene , with the appearance there of Cyonasua .
Genetic studies have shown that kinkajous are a sister group to all other extant procyonids ; they split off about 22.6 Ma ago .
The clades leading to coatis and olingos on one hand , and to ringtails and raccoons on the other , separated about 17.7 Ma ago .
The divergence between olingos and coatis is estimated to have occurred about 10.2 Ma ago , at about the same time that ringtails and raccoons parted ways .
CLASSIFICATION Section::::Classification .
There has been considerable historical uncertainty over the correct classification of several members .
The red panda was previously classified in this family , but it is now classified in its own family , the Ailuridae , based on molecular biology studies .
The status of the various olingos was disputed : some regarded them all as subspecies of Bassaricyon gabbii before DNA sequence data demonstrated otherwise .
The traditional classification scheme shown below on the left predates the recent revolution in our understanding of procyonid phylogeny based on genetic sequence analysis .
This outdated classification groups kinkajous and olingos together on the basis of similarities in morphology that are now known to be an example of parallel evolution ; similarly , coatis are shown as being most closely related to raccoons , when in fact they are closest to olingos .
Below right is a cladogram showing the results of the recent molecular studies .
Genus Nasuella was not included in these studies , but in a separate study was found to nest within Nasua .
