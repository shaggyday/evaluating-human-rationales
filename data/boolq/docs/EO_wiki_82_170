DOUBLE DUTY Double Duty also referred to as the Indy - Charlotte Double or Memorial Day Double , refers to an accomplishment in automobile racing in which a driver competes in the Indianapolis 500 and Coca - Cola 600 in the same day .
The feat was first attempted by John Andretti on May 29 , 1994 .
In 2001 , Tony Stewart became the first and only driver to date to successfully complete all 1,100 miles of both races in the same day .
The two races , organized by separate sanctioning bodies — IndyCar and NASCAR respectively — are held on Memorial Day weekend , and are considered two of the biggest annual events on the U.S. motorsports calendar .
The " Double Duty " calls for a driver to compete at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway , Indiana in the early afternoon , then take an airplane to Concord , North Carolina to race at Charlotte Motor Speedway in the evening .
The feat is considered difficult on face , as well as physically demanding and mentally draining .
It is somewhat similar in concept to the established discipline of endurance racing , however , the driver is expected to drive both races in their entirety without the help of a relief driver .
Considerable media attention usually spotlights a driver who attempts the " Double Duty .
" The concept dates back specifically to 1994 , but as far back as the 1960s , other drivers attempted to compete in both events when they were held on different days of the week , an effort known as " crossover . "
During the 1960s and 1970s , a handful of drivers raced at the Indianapolis 500 while maintaining a full - time schedule in Formula One .
This would require them to travel between Indianapolis and Europe during the month of May , usually between Indy and Monaco , on an equally as demanding schedule .
The last driver to do so was Teo Fabi in 1984 , going from the Indy 500 to Monaco .
Due to the scheduling of Monaco on the same day as Indy , in 2017 , Fernando Alonso chose to skip Monaco to compete at the Indy 500 .
Four drivers ( John Andretti , Robby Gordon , Tony Stewart and Kurt Busch ) have attempted the Indianapolis / Charlotte " Double Duty " feat .
Of these , Tony Stewart 's 2001 effort stands as the best combined result .
He finished 6th at Indianapolis and 3rd at Charlotte , completing all 1,100 miles .
Among the handful of drivers in the 1960s and 1970s that attempted " crossovers , " Donnie Allison competed in both events in a year in which they were held on successive days .
To date , the most recent attempt was made by Busch in 2014 .
He finished in 6th place at the Indianapolis 500 , and was the fastest rookie .
However , he dropped out of the Coca Cola 600 with a blown engine mid - race .
He completed 906 miles .
LOGISTICS Section::::Logistics .
The Indianapolis 500 is part of the Verizon IndyCar Series , and the Coca - Cola 600 is part of the NASCAR Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series .
Both races are held , weather permitting , on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend .
The Indy 500 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is traditionally scheduled in the afternoon , while the Coca - Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway is held as a night race .
Since the events are not scheduled to overlap , this allows a driver a small window to travel between venues .
Such an accomplishment can be grueling and physically exhausting .
It calls for a driver to race for over seven hours in two entirely different disciplines of racing cars .
Along with a 430-mile airplane flight , and severe time constraints , the driver has time for only a brief rest aboard the aircraft where he normally takes on IV fluids , and is checked out by a physician .
Weather plays a significant factor in the logistics of " Double Duty .
" If weather cooperates and there is no rain at either venue , delays are usually minimal .
However , if rain delays one of the races ( particularly Indianapolis ) , it can significantly disrupt or completely cancel the opportunity for the attempt .
According to NASCAR rules all drivers are required , without exception , to attend in person the pre - race drivers ' meeting or suffer a grid penalty .
If a driver misses the meeting for any reason , he is forced to start from last position on the grid .
The meeting normally takes place approximately two hours before the start of the race ( Coca - Cola 600 ) , and under the circumstances of " Double Duty , " the driver would have little or no opportunity to attend in - person .
Despite attempts over the years to lobby the officials , including garage area petitions , and use of a video - conference device , drivers attempting " Double Duty " have all been required to start at the back of the grid for the Coca - Cola 600 .
MONTH OF MAY
EVENTS Section::::Month of May events .
When a driver attempts " Double Duty , " his complicated schedule is not just limited to race day .
Additional flights back - and - forth between the venues are required in the two weeks leading up to the races in order to participate in practice and qualifying for the respective events .
Time trials for the Indy 500 are held on Saturday and Sunday one week before the race .
This potentially creates conflicts with the Monster Energy NASCAR All - Star Race .
Qualifying for the Coca - Cola 600 is held on Thursday night , while Carb Day , the final practice session at Indy , is held on Friday .
Typically drivers are also obligated to make appearances for sponsors and event marketing in the days leading up to the races , which can add to the travel burdens .
ITINERARY Section::::Itinerary .
A driver attempting the " Double Duty " has an extremely busy and tight schedule , particularly for race day .
The morning begins in Indianapolis , and at the conclusion of the Indy 500 ( or when the drivers drops out of the race ) , he immediately travels from the Speedway ( via helicopter or police escort ) to a nearby airport - Eagle Creek , Indianapolis International , or another in the vicinity .
The flight from Indianapolis to Concord Regional Airport aboard a private jet takes approximately 55 minutes .
From there , the driver will swiftly board a helicopter to Charlotte Motor Speedway , and land in the infield .
Upon arriving at the Coca - Cola 600 , the driver is escorted to his machine , in time for the start , if all goes as planned .
The schedule and the logistics are planned well in advance , and even the slightest deviation can cause significant delay and force the driver to miss the second race .
Weather can cause unexpected delay , and even force the effort to be aborted .
Due to the complex nature of the scheduling , it is standard practice for the driver 's respective teams to have back - up relief drivers standing by at both events , in case the schedule is compromised .
Depending upon which of the two events is considered the top priority , a " drop dead " departure time may be assigned at Indy .
According to NASCAR rules , the driver who starts the race in the car receives full championship points for that entry .
If the driver is a full - time competitor on the Cup Series circuit ( and only part - time in IndyCar ) , the team may require the driver to leave Indy before that race is over in order to arrive at Charlotte on - time and receive full points .
Conversely , if the Indy 500 is the top priority , and that race is running long , the driver may chose to forgo or delay the trip to Charlotte , and assign the back - up driver to start the 600 instead .

" CROSS - OVER " HISTORY ( 1960–1993 ) Section::::"Cross - over " history ( 1960–1993 ) .
The Indianapolis 500 debuted in 1911 , and from its onset , was scheduled in conjunction with Memorial Day .
In 1960 , Charlotte Motor Speedway was completed , and the inaugural World 600 was scheduled for Memorial Day weekend as well .
However , for 1960 , it was postponed until June 19 in order to ready the facility .
Starting in 1961 , both Indy and Charlotte were scheduled around Memorial Day .
Through the 1960s , the Indy 500 was normally scheduled for Memorial Day proper ( May 30 ) regardless of the day of the week .
When May 30 fell on a Sunday , the Indy 500 was moved to Monday May 31 .
At Charlotte , the World 600 was to be scheduled for the Sunday closest to Memorial Day .
Thus for more than a decade , the two races were held on different days of the week .
This prompted a handful of NASCAR regulars to attempt to race in the Indy 500 .
On a few occasions , drivers were able to " cross - over " and compete in both events , or skip the race at Charlotte in favor of Indy .
The NASCAR points system utilized at the time , as well as the structure of the schedule itself , differed substantially from modern times .
The system was much more forgiving of drivers who missed a single race , which is why some drivers chose to skip Charlotte altogether .
In 1971 , the Uniform Monday Holiday Act took effect , and began to alter the respective schedules for the races .
Starting in 1974 , the Indy 500 was permanently moved to the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend .
Thus from 1974 to 1992 , the races were scheduled for the same day , and at roughly the same starting time .
Therefore , drivers were not able to compete in both events .
Furthermore , in 1975 , the NASCAR points system was overhauled , and became much more unforgiving to drivers missing individual races .
Very few NASCAR regulars would choose to skip Charlotte , which was emerging as one of the crown jewels on the Winston Cup calendar .
Starting in 1985 , the World 600 secured the sponsorship of The Coca - Cola Company , and henceforth became known as the Coca - Cola 600 . 1963

In 1993 , the start time for the Coca - Cola 600 was moved to 4:30 p.m. eastern , which eliminated overlap with the Indy 500 , and the race became an evening / night race .
The 4:30 p.m. start time did not yet allow adequate time for a competitor to complete both , but the idea was planted , and subsequent years , the start time for the 600 was moved later , and a travel window would open up . 1994 Section::::1994 .
IndyCar veteran John Andretti switched full - time to the NASCAR Winston Cup Series starting in 1994 , but desired to also compete in the Indy 500 .

2005–2012
Section::::2005–2012 .
In 2005 , the start time for the Indy 500 was moved to 12 p.m. EST ( 1 p.m. EDT ) , which significantly reduced the amount of time available for travel between the events .
From 2005 - 2010 , the time frame was deemed insufficient , and despite various rumors of possible attempts over the years , the opportunity to perform " Double Duty " was effectively on hiatus .
During this period , while no drivers attempted to compete in both races , some drivers and owners attended both races in whole or in part .
In 2006 , Penske Racing 's Kurt Busch was in attendance at Indianapolis the morning of the race and watched the start of the 500 as a guest of Team Penske .
Shortly after , he flew to Charlotte to arrive in time for the drivers meeting , and raced in the 600 .
In 2007 , Richard Petty watched the start of the Indy 500 , along with Robbie Loomis and Dale Inman .
They then flew to Charlotte to attend the 600 .
Car owner Chip Ganassi was also scheduled to attend both races , but due to a mid - race rain delay , remained at Indy .
In 2010 , Ganassi won at Indy with driver Dario Franchitti , then later flew to Charlotte to take in the second half of the 600 .
His driver Jamie McMurray finished second in the 600 .
For 2011 , the start time for the Indy 500 was moved back to 12 noon EDT , which effectively re - opened the travel window and made it possible to attempt " Double Duty " once again .
Rumors began to surface that drivers ( namely Robby Gordon ) were interested in making the attempt .
NASCAR regulars Jimmie Johnson and Kasey Kahne also reportedly expressed interest , and a rumor of a $ 20 million award for winning both races circulated .
No plans ever materialized .
A year later , despite some rumors about possibly doing the double in 2012 , Danica Patrick also nixed plans to compete in both races .
2013 Section::::2013 .
In early May 2013 , 2004 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series champion Kurt Busch tested for Andretti Autosport at Indianapolis , opening up the possibility of a " Double Duty " attempt in 2014 .
During the private test , Busch reached a top lap of 218 mph .
Busch successfully passed his initial rookie test for the Indianapolis 500 . 2014 Section::::2014 .
On March 4 , 2014 , it was announced that Kurt Busch would attempt " Double Duty " with Andretti Autosport .
The effort was done in - part to help raise awareness for military veterans with PTSD and TBI .
Busch took part in a refresher test on April 29 , and a week later participated in the annual Rookie Orientation Program .
Busch led the speed chart on Rookie Orientation day , then posted the second - fastest speed on May 13 .
On May 17 , the first day of time trials , Busch made two qualifying attempts , and posted the 10th - fastest speed , just missing the Fast Nine Shootout .
Just moments after his second attempt , he boarded a helicopter and then flew to Charlotte to compete in the NASCAR Sprint All - Star Race .
Busch finished 11th in the All - Star Race , then flew back to Indianapolis for the second day of time trials .
On May 18 , Busch qualified for the 12th starting position for the Indy 500 .
On Monday , Busch participated in the post - qualifying practice session at Indy .
About an hour and a half into the session , he suffered a hard crash in the exit of turn two .
He was uninjured but forced to switch to a backup car for Carb Day and race day .
On race day at Indianapolis , Busch started 12th , and fell back to as low as 20th .
Although he was not a factor for the win , he finished on the lead lap in 6th and was the highest - finishing rookie .
He tied with Robby Gordon and Tony Stewart as the three drivers to finish 6th , the best Indianapolis finish for Double Duty drivers .
Busch arrived in Charlotte with time to spare , but was still required to start at the rear of the field due to missing the mandatory pre - race driver 's meeting .
He ran as high as the top 15 , but ultimately failed to finish with a mid - race engine failure .
He completed a total of of racing .
Busch was named the Indy 500 Rookie of the Year .
Busch 's effort was documented on the NBCSN series 36 .
2015–2018
Section::::2015–2018 .
Indiana native Jeff Gordon , during his last NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season , drove the pace car at the start of the 2015 Indianapolis 500 before flying to Charlotte for the Coca Cola 600 .
He has never competed in the Indy 500 , although he did win the Brickyard 400 five times .
Doug Rice , the anchor of the Performance Racing Network , as well as the anchor for the Brickyard 400 on the IMS Radio Network , joined the broadcast crew as a pit reporter for the Indy 500 .
Rice performed broadcasting " double duty " , working the pits for the Indy 500 , then flying to Charlotte Motor Speedway to call the Coca - Cola 600 later that evening .
He is believed to be the first broadcaster to cover both races in - person on the same day .
For 2016 , 2017 and 2018 , despite some very early rumors , no drivers attempted double duty at Indy and Charlotte .
In 2017 , however , a highly publicized " crossover " type effort saw Formula One champion Fernando Alonso skip the Monaco Grand Prix and compete at Indianapolis ; despite leading laps , he failed to finish when his nemesis of the past three F1 seasons ( Honda engines ) struck again while suspension damage took his McLaren MCL32 out of the Monaco GP ( sustained when substitute driver Jenson Button tried a dive - bomb pass on the Sauber of Pascal Wehrlein at Portier only to punt Wehrlein into the barrier on his side ) .
RACE RESULTS Section::::Race results .

Section::::Other uses of the term .
Section::::Indianapolis 500 and Grand Prix of Monaco .
During the 1960s and 1970s , a handful of drivers raced at the Indianapolis 500 while maintaining a full - time schedule in Formula One .
This would require them to travel between Indianapolis and Europe during the month of May , usually between Indy and the Monaco Grand Prix at Monte Carlo , two of the three components of the Triple Crown of Motorsport .
For many years , Indy and Monaco were not held on the same day .
Furthermore , prior to 1971 , the Indy 500 was held on May 30 regardless of the day of the week ( unless it fell on a Sunday , in which case it was scheduled for Monday May 31 ) .
With the Indy 500 often falling on a weekday , and Monaco usually held on a Sunday a week or two prior , travel burdens were relatively workable .
Racing at both Indy and Monaco in the same year became mostly impossible after Indy was moved to race on Sunday starting in 1974 , and Monaco likewise was eventually moved to the last Sunday in May ( same day as Indy ) , ending just a couple hours before the green flag dropped at Indianapolis .
SAME WEEKEND RACES Section::::Same weekend races .
There are other lesser , informal uses of the term " Double Duty " in context to motorsports .
Namely instances where a driver competes in two major races on the same day or on successive days .
This occurs in a fairly regular fashion in NASCAR , where a driver ( often numerous drivers ) compete in the Xfinity Series and Sprint Cup Series events , or even Camping World Truck Series races ; this practice is widely known as " Buschwhacking " .
However , in most cases , the multiple events take place at the same venue , diminishing the complexity of the feat .
At times , some drivers even raced the entire Sprint Cup and entire Nationwide schedule , which included some travel between cities for a handful of weekends where the two series were at different venues .
On rare occasions , there have been situations in which a Nationwide Series race became rained out , and was rescheduled for the day of the Sprint Cup race .
This occurred the weekend of the 2007 Winn - Dixie 250 and Pepsi 400 at Daytona , and the 2010 spring weekend at Talladega , with the Aaron 's 312 happening after the Aaron 's 499 .
In the later case , the resulting distance was over 851 miles distance traveled , as both races were extended by green - white - checkered finishes .
Ironically , in the latter , Kevin Harvick and Jamie McMurray were the top two cars at the white flag for both races ; Harvick won the Cup race by a bumper over McMurray , and McMurray started the big one as Brad Keselowski snuck by Harvick for the win during the Nationwide Series race .
Similarly , double duty has occurred in instances where a NASCAR driver also takes part in a support race ( namely Grand Am ) , but seldom attempted when the races were at different tracks .
This is more prevalent at road courses such as Watkins Glen or Sonoma .
Another example of this is at Daytona , where the Paul Revere 250 was held the same day as the Firecracker 400 numerous times , and several drivers competed in both .
Another short - lived " double duty " occurred between the Indianapolis 500 and IMSA .
A few drivers , Geoff Brabham , Kevin Cogan , and Rocky Moran , competed at Indy on Sunday , and at Lime Rock on Monday .
