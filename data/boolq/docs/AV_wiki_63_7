WOLF SPIDER Wolf spiders are members of the family Lycosidae , from the Ancient Greek word " " meaning " wolf " .
They are robust and agile hunters with excellent eyesight .
They live mostly in solitude and hunt alone , and do not spin webs .
Some are opportunistic hunters pouncing upon prey as they find it or even chasing it over short distances .
Some wait for passing prey in or near the mouth of a burrow .
Wolf spiders resemble nursery web spiders ( family Pisauridae ) , but wolf spiders carry their egg sacs by attaching them to their spinnerets .
( the Pisauridae carry their egg sacs with their chelicerae and pedipalps ) .
Two of the wolf spider 's eight eyes are large and prominent , which distinguishes them from the nursery web spiders whose eyes are all of roughly equal size .
This can also help distinguish them from grass spiders .
DESCRIPTION Section::::Description .
The many genera of wolf spiders range in body size ( legs not included ) from less than .
They have eight eyes arranged in three rows .
The bottom row consists of four small eyes , the middle row has two very large eyes ( which distinguishes them from the Pisauridae ) , and the top row has two medium - sized eyes .
Unlike most other arachnids , which are generally blind or have poor vision , wolf spiders have excellent eyesight with their large eyes .
The sensory hairs on their legs and bodies give them an acute sense of touch .
Flashing a beam of light over the spider produces eyeshine .
The light from the flashlight has been reflected from the spider 's eyes directly back toward its source , producing a " glow " that is easily noticed .
This is also especially helpful because when the nocturnal wolf spiders are out hunting for food it makes it easier to find them .
Wolf spiders possess the third - best eyesight of all spider groups , bested by jumping spiders of the family Salticidae ( which can distinguish colors ) and the huntsman spiders .
Wolf spiders are unique in the way that they carry their eggs .
The egg sac , a round , silken globe , is attached to the spinnerets at the end of the abdomen , allowing the spider to carry her unborn young with her .
The abdomen must be held in a raised position to keep the egg case from dragging on the ground .
However , despite this handicap , they are still capable of hunting .
Another aspect unique to wolf spiders is their method of care of young .
Immediately after the spiderlings emerge from their protective silken case , they clamber up their mother 's legs and crowd onto the dorsal side of her abdomen .
The mother carries the spiderlings for several weeks before they are large enough to disperse and fend for themselves .
No other spiders are currently known to carry their young on their backs for any period of time .
Because they depend on camouflage for protection , they do not have the flashy appearance of some other kinds of spiders .
In general , their coloration is appropriate to their favorite habitat .
Hogna is the genus with the largest of the wolf spiders .
Among the Hogna species in the U.S. , the nearly solid dark brown H. carolinensis ( Carolina wolf spider ) is the largest , with a body that can be more than long .
It is sometimes confused with H. helluo , which is somewhat smaller and different in coloration .
The underside of H. carolinensis is solid black , but the underside of H. helluo is variegated and has reds , oranges , and yellows with shades of black .
Some members of the Lycosidae , such as H. carolinensis , make deep , tubular burrows in which they lurk much of the time .
Others , such as H. helluo , seek shelter under rocks and other shelters as nature may provide .
They may wander from place to place , so are likely to be attracted into human habitation when the weather starts to turn colder in autumn .
As with spiders in general , males of almost any species can sometimes be found inside homes and buildings as they wander in search for females during the autumn .
Many smaller genera of wolf spiders are found in the United Kingdom .
They live in pastures and fields and feed on smaller prey , playing an important role in natural population control that keeps insect numbers in the wolf spiders ' vicinity within acceptable levels .
VENOM Section::::Venom .
Wolf spiders inject venom if continually provoked .
Symptoms of their bites include swelling , mild pain , and itching .
In the past , necrotic bites have been attributed to some South American species , but further investigation has indicated that those problems that did occur were probably actually due to bites by members of other genera .
Australian wolf spiders have also been associated with necrotic wounds , but careful study has likewise shown them not to produce such results .

Wolf spiders can be found in a wide range of habitats both coastal and inland .
These include shrublands , woodland , wet coastal forest , alpine meadows , suburban gardens , and homes .
Spiderlings disperse aerially ; consequently , wolf spiders have wide distributions .
Although some species have very specific microhabitat needs ( such as stream - side gravel beds or montane herb - fields ) , most are wanderers without permanent homes .
Some build burrows which can be left open or have a trap door ( depending on species ) .
Arid - zone species construct turrets or plug their holes with leaves and pebbles during the rainy season to protect themselves from flood waters .
Often they are found in man - made locations such as sheds and other outdoor equipment .
HONORARIA Section::::Honoraria .
The Carolina wolf spider ( H. carolinensis ) is the official state spider of South Carolina , designated as such in 2000 .
South Carolina is the only U.S. state that recognizes a state spider .
