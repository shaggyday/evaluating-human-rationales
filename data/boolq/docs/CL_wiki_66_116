THE TIME " Party All the Time " is a 1985 single by comedian and actor Eddie Murphy , written and produced by Rick James and Kevin Johnston .

How Could It Be .
The single was recorded at James ' home studio in Buffalo , New York .
It reached # 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks , behind " Say You , Say Me " by Lionel Richie .
Rick James also provided vocals for the song .
The song is a lament by the singer that despite the expensive things he gives her , his girlfriend prefers to spend her time out dancing and flirting with other men , rather than staying at home and showing affection for him .
Since 2014 , the song has enjoyed a mini resurgence in Scotland thanks largely to the supporters of St Johnstone F.C. , who now have adopted it as an unofficial club anthem .
