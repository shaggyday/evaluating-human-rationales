When her mother Jocelyn goes missing , Clary learns that the event is connected to the conflict between the Shadowhunters and their enemies .
She then enters the Shadowhunter fold , ther she finds that she also is a Shadowhunter .

Clary learns that Valentine Morgenstern , who is supposed to be long dead , but truly is not , the main antagonist of the series , is her biological father and her mother 's husband .

In the second book of the series , City of Ashes , Clary dates her best friend Simon , who has for a long time had a crush on her , in order to forget Jace during the torturous time of believing him to be her brother .
She is told by the Seelie Queen that she and Jace are Valentine 's experiments but mysteriously does not explain further .
She finds out later that she was exposed to powdered Angel blood through her mother who consumed it unknowingly by Valentine when she was pregnant with Clary .
This angelic blood granted her the ability to create runes that do not exist ; and amplify the power of existing runes for herself .
In the end of the second novel , Clary finds that an old friend of her mother , Madeleine , knows how to wake her mother , who has been in a magical coma since the first book .
In City of Glass , it is discovered that Jocelyn had taken a potion , made by a warlock named Ragnor Fell , to induce a comatose state and prevent her from being interrogated by Valentine .
Before she dies , Madeleine tells Clary she needs to find Fell , who will help her cure her mother .
Clary , using her power to create runes , creates a rune with the ability to create a Portal a magic and conveys herself and Luke to Idris , and falls into Lake Lyn and drinks some of the water by accident ; this causes her to hallucinate and then to become lucid , because the lake 's water is poisonous to Shadowhunters .
Luke then takes her to his sister Amatis for healing .
During her stay in Alicante , Clary ventures to find Ragnor Fell , who will be able to help her with the potion .
She is escorted there by Sebastian Verlac , whom she recently met , in an attempt to make contact with Fell .
Instead she finds Magnus Bane .
He tells her of Ragnor 's death and how he was called as a replacement , and requests that she find him the Book of White in return for his help .
She returns to Alicante , where Sebastian kisses her .
She rejects him after having feelings of " wrong " while he kissed her , and they continue back to Alicante .
She then learns that something called the Book of White has been hidden in Wayland Manor , and travels with Jace to retrieve it .
Inside the Manor , they find the angel Ithuriel tied up and left for dead in the basement .
He gives both Shadowhunters visions of Valentine experimenting on his children with demon and his angel blood in an attempt to make a stronger warrior .
They escape from Wayland Manor , after freeing Ithuriel so that he can finally die ; the two then share a moment of passionate romance .
They return to Alicante to see it burning from the first assault on the city , and after things are in order , Clary meets with the others and they go to free Simon who was taken to a Conclave prison called The Guard .
They return to see the Clave , and Clary uses her rune ability to create a binding rune , enabling Shadowhunters and Downworlders to share powers .
All those of age go to the battle on Brocelind Plains , and Clary has to give Simon the Mark of Cain so that the vampires will join the fight .
At last , Magnus wakes Clary 's mother Jocelyn , who informs Clary that Jace is not her brother .
Her real brother is Sebastian ( Jonathan Morgenstern ) .
It is soon revealed that Sebastian is a spy for Valentine and that he tried to seduce Clary into teaming up with him .
Clary then tries to locate Jace to help him .
She runs into Valentine , who ties her down in order to complete his summoning of the Angel Raziel by using her blood .
Then , when Jace arrives to rescue her , Valentine forces her to watch as he fatally stabs Jace in the chest .
Upon summoning the angel , Clary changes the marks on Valentine 's summoning circle , giving her the ability to control the Angel , and after Valentine is slain , she wishes to have Jace back .
After Jace is brought back to life , the two get together .
In the fourth book , City of Fallen Angels , Clary and Jace are happily in love .
But soon , Jace starts to behave strangely and avoids her , leading Clary to assume he wants to break up with her .
In truth , he has been influenced by Lilith , mother of all demons and former wife of Adam before Eve , who sent him dreams in which he kills or hurts Clary , because when he was raised from the dead by Raziel , all of his protections placed on him at birth were stripped away , leaving him vulnerable to demonic influence .
During the party , when Lucian 's pack celebrated his engagement with Clary 's mother Jocelyn , she is kidnapped by a fully possessed Jace and taken to Lilith .
There , she learns her brother Jonathan Christopher Morgenstern / Sebastian Verlac is going to be raised from the dead by Simon , who is blackmailed by Lilith for the life of Clary , and she was brought just to make him do that .
Using Jace 's affection for her ( which remains undiminished because his possession has no effect on that part of him ) , she cuts the rune which enabled Lilith to control him .
Jace and Lilith fight fiercely , until Lilith stops him by torturing Clary .
Seeing his chance , Simon comes in the way of Liliths blow to Clary , the Mark of Cain possessed by him returns the blow sevenfold to Lilith , destroying her .
After Lilith 's destruction , Isabelle and Alec appear on the scene , but Jace shoos them away since he does n't want to be consoled as he feels terrible for hurting Clary , in spite of the fact that he was n't himself .
Alec then shoves Clary back to the room as they get into the elevator , feeling that only she can help him .
Clary and Jace reaffirm their love after she convinces him he is not a horrible person .
The last words Clary says to him before going down are , " I 'll be back .
Five minutes , " and they share a kiss before she leaves and comes back to find him gone , unaware his rune has healed and he is possessed once again .
In the fifth book of the series , City of Lost Souls , Clary has realized that Jace has gone away with Sebastian Verlac ( Jonathan Morgenstern ) .
The Clave was alarmed by the sudden disappearance of Jonathan and Jace and started to search for any signs of them , after two weeks of repeating the same statement about what happened at the rooftop , before Clary left him with Sebastian , alive by Simon 's blood .
But other problems come to the Clave and it has to set aside the search for Jonathan .
Clary is outraged by the news .
Using the bell given to her by Kaelie Whitewillow , a waitress and subject of the Queen 's , she goes to the Seelie Queen 's palace where she has to beg for help due to the limited resources .
The Seelie Queen has requested that Clary be allowed to steal the faerie rings kept inside the Institute .
Clary steals the rings but does n't give them to the Queen because of the appearance of Jace and Sebastian at the library , all healthy looking and safe .
Afterward , Clary accepts their offer of coming to them .
When the plan of Sebastian was finally revealed to her , she could n't believe what could happen .
At the enchantment ceremony , she was surprised when Amatis was turned into a dark Shadowhunter by the blood of Lilith .
At the same time , Magnus , Alec , Maryse , Isabelle , and Simon arrived , with Glorious in hand .
When Glorious was handed to her , she struck Jace , the mark of Lilith burning , making him cry out in pain .
In the epilogue , she was concerned why she could n't visit Jace because of her thoughts telling her she almost killed Jace , but reassured by Isabelle she did n't do anything to make Jace mad .
She visited Jace , but she almost thought she was n't going to be allowed to go in due to Brother Zachariah .
By the consent of Brother Zachariah , she entered , hugging Jace and reaffirming their relationship .
Finally in City of Heavenly Fire , Sebastian has taken many shadowhunters and turned them into his endarkened .
The remaining shadowhunters retreat to Idris for safety .
Sebastian offers to leave them alone if he is given Clary and Jace .
Before the Clave can make a decision Clary , Jace , Simon , Isabelle and Alec sneak off to Edom , the demon realm Sebastian is hiding in ; he has Jocelyn , Luke , Magnus and Raphael prisoner .
After spending days trying to find him they come upon his castle , a dark version of Alicante .
Sebastian offers Clary a place next to him , in exchange for leaving everyone she knows and all of the Shadowhunters alone .
She accepts it , knowing that she has to keep everyone safe .
When Sebastian is momentarily distracted she stabs him with the Morgenstern blade , containing heavenly fire .
He is returned to the brother that she could have had , before he then dies .
The group manage to escape after Simon gives up his immortality and memories of the Shadow World to Magnus Banes 's father , Asmodeus .

but he does n't remember her .

- HERONDALE Section::::Jace Lightwood - Herondale .
Jace Lightwood - Herondale is a Shadowhunter living at the New York Institute with his adopted family .
Jace 's legal name changes throughout the series , from Jace Wayland ( when his father is thought to be Michael Wayland ) , to Jonathan Morgenstern ( Valentine 's son ) , to Jace Lightwood for the family that has taken him in , to Jace Herondale ( when his true father is revealed to be Stephen Herondale ) .
His mother was the young CelinÃ© Herondale , a member of Valentine 's inner circle with Stephen Herondale , his father .
The nickname " Jace " was given to him by Maryse Lightwood after his ( fake ) initials J.C. ( Jonathan Christopher , because no one but Valentine and Jocelyn knew Jace was not his real son ) , when he first began living with Maryse Lightwood and her family , because of his dislike for his name .
Jace was given the blood of an angel named Ithuriel by Valentine when CelinÃ© was pregnant with him .
This gave him enhanced abilities , even compared to regular Shadowhunters ( Shadowhunters hunt demons that come into this world through portals from their own worlds ) , such as the ability to jump from extreme heights and survive , run faster than any other Shadowhunter , and move with a stealth close to that of the Silent Brothers .
For most of the books , Jace 's sarcastic , cold remarks and behavior hide his tortured and angry soul .
In City of Ashes , his strong " bad - boy " personality makes Maryse Lightwood ( his adopted mother )
somewhat scared of him , worried that he is too much like Valentine , who was believed to be his real father until the assumption was proven false in City of Glass .
Jace and Clary fall in love in City of Bones , making Clary the only girl Jace has developed real genuine feelings for , but after they find out they are " siblings " , each attempts to get over the other by dating other people .
He is naturally overprotective and caring for her , although Clary does not see this due to her internal suffering .
At the end of the third novel , City of Glass , Jocelyn contradicts Valentine 's avowal that Jace and Clary are siblings , telling Clary that Jace is actually the son of Celine and Stephen Herondale .
The truth frees Jace and Clary from the torture of having seemingly incestuous feelings for each other , allowing them to accept their mutual feelings and become a " real " couple .
Physical appearance
Jace has fine , wavy dark golden - blond hair and dark gold eyes .
He has a slim , muscular build , and is about 5'11 " .
His face is described as being pretty and angular , and Clary often refers to him as beautiful and leonine , with a narrow mouth .
His eyes were much lighter in City of Bones , City of Ashes , and City of Glass ; Clary describes his eyes and hair as darker in City of Fallen Angels .
His eyes are brown with flecks of gold that lighten and darken with his moods .
Like all other Shadowhunters , he is covered in thin , pale scars from years of applying various magical runes with a stele for battle and healing purposes , as well as permanent runes .
It is said that Jace is seventeen years old , though that was assuming he was Valentine ( or Michael Wayland 's ) son , and his real age is between a few years younger than Jonathan Christopher and a year or so older than Clary .
Jace is also left - handed ( like Valentine ) .
He has often said ( and tried to prove ) that the only trait he got from his father was his attitude .
He is described to be extremely good looking .
Jace is portrayed by Jamie Campbell Bower in the film adaptation of the book and Dominic Sherwood in the television series .
Family
In City of Bones , Jace lives with his adoptive family , the Lightwoods , and is seen as the brother of the Lightwood children .
Later , he is told that he is the son of Valentine and Jocelyn Morgenstern , and not Michael Wayland as he had been told .
At this time , he is also told that Clary Fray is his sister .
In the end it is revealed that he is actually Stephen Herondale and Celine Herondale 's son and that Clary is not related to him .
He and Clary have a conversation at the end of City of Glass in which he confesses that he does n't know who he is , referring to his last name .
Clary confirms that he is a Lightwood , and Jace accepts that , correcting people throughout City of Fallen Angels when they referred to him as " Jace Herondale " .
At the end of City of Heavenly Fire , Jace chooses to take on the Herondale name .
Jace is also related to Will Herondale former leader of the London Institute and husband of Warlock Tessa Grey .

Isabelle further claims that she has never seen him act the way he does with Clary and states that Jace will never get over her .
Throughout the series , Jace continuously loves Clary even after he believes they are siblings , to the extent that he is willing to commit incest with her and have a secret relationship .

In order to protect him , Clary draws the Mark of Cain on Simon , which prevents him from being harmed by anyone and also curses him , marking him as a wanderer for eternity .
In City of Fallen Angels , a conflicted Simon tries casually dating both Isabelle and Maia .
When the girls find out , they both leave him , and he is alone once more .
However , by the end of the book it is clear that a deepening relationship is forming between Simon and Isabelle .
In City of Lost Souls , Simon loses his Mark of Cain to the Angel Raziel in exchange for the sword " Glorious " to save Jace by separating him and Sebastian .

At the end , after defeating Sebastian , they have no possible way of getting out .
Magnus calls on his father , Asmodeus , who asks to help them get out of Edom since Sebastian closed all possible ways for them to get out .
In return , Asmodeus wants Magnus ' immortal life â€“ if Magnus does this , he will die .
None of them want Magnus to sacrifice his life , so Simon steps forward .
Because Simon has only just become a vampire , his years will not catch up to him and he will return a mundane .
But to spice up the deal , Asmodeus also says he must take away all of Simon 's memory of the Shadow world and of Clary .
Everything he will remember will be a normal life , a life without Clary , or Jace , or Alec , or Magnus and Isabelle .
This devastated them all , but Simon gave it willingly to save his friends and the person he loves .

The flyer says the band 's name , " The Mortal Instruments " .
With this sliver of hope , Izzy and Magnus go to Simon and tell him what has happened .

and he can regain all of his memory .

It is mentioned by Camille Belcourt that he bears a strong resemblance to William Herondale from The Infernal Devices .
He was portrayed by Kevin Zegers in the film adaptation of the book , and Matthew Daddario in the television series .
Family Alec is the oldest child of the Lightwood family , and the first son of Maryse and Robert Lightwood .

Alec 's love interests
* Jace Herondale :
Alec is gay , and for the most part of the series , he remains convinced that he 's always been in love with Jace .
In City of Glass , however , Jace tells him that Alec thought he was in love with him because Jace was " safe , " and an excuse not to take risks and try going out with someone else , namely , Magnus Bane .
* Magnus Bane :
Alec 's boyfriend , a bisexual warlock .
Magnus had always shown interest in Alec throughout the books , openly flirting with him upon meeting him in the first novel of the series and flirtatiously telling Alec to " call him " after winking at him .
This eventually resulting in Alec starting a secret relationship with him by the end of the novel .
After Jace 's challenge , Alec kisses Magnus in front of all the Shadowhunters in front of the Clave when they were choosing partners for the battle in City of Glass , however in the TV adaptation of the novels Alec revealed this by kissing Magnus in the middle of Alec 's arranged marriage with clave representative Lydia Branwell and revealed his association to him and his sexuality .
Also , when Clary cast a Rune that made her look like the person the onlooker loved the most , it is implied that Alec saw Magnus .
Later , his mother accepts the fact that he is gay ( although his father does not completely comes to terms with it ) and in the book City of Fallen Angels , he and Magnus are on a vacation around the world , going to places like Paris , India , and other parts of Europe .
They are called back when Magnus is needed to interrogate Camille .
Alec is shocked at Magnus ' long dating history and becomes worried about their future together because of Magnus ' immortality and his mortality .
He begins to speculate that the reason Magnus wanted the Book of White was to make Alec immortal , so they could stay together forever ( although it is later revealed in the series that Magnus had actually wanted it so that he could take away his immortality and become mortal in order to be with Alec ) .
He worries that Magnus will move on soon , and that he is just another lover for him in a long line .
However , Magnus tells him he is not trivial , and that he is n't ready to lose Alec any time soon and ca n't imagine a future without him .
They agree to wait and hope for the best .
In City of Lost Souls , Alec is offered the power to shorten Magnus ' lifespan by Camille , allowing them to grow old together .
Alec does n't reveal the offer to Magnus and briefly considers it .
Despite the fact that he ultimately refuses Camille 's offer , realizing he would n't be able to go through with it , Magnus breaks up with Alec because he did not share the fact that he 'd been talking to Camille and considered shortening his life at all .
Magnus confesses that while he still loves him , they are through as a couple .
Magnus shares one final kiss with Alec before walking away from a tearful and heartbroken Alec .
In final novel , City of Heavenly Fire , Alec keeps calling Magnus after their tragic break up , but keeps hanging up whenever Magnus answers the call , resulting in Jace breaking his phone to get him to stop .
A little later in the book , Alec and Magnus briefly speak and kiss when Magnus comes to say goodbye to Alec before the Lightwoods and the Institute 's Shadowhunters leave for Idris to be protected from Sebastian 's attacks .
Magnus later follows Alec to Idris as the warlocks ' representative for the Clave 's meetings ; before he can speak to Alec , however , he is tricked into capture at a dinner hosted by the faeries .
Alec , along with his friends , travel to Edom / hell to save Magnus and defeat Sebastian .
By the end of the novel , after an emotional , tumultuous reunion in Edom , they are back together , for Magnus had time to think while broken up .
Magnus presents a journal full of stories from his past that shaped who he is in present - day ( later revealed to be " The Bane Chronicles " , the story collection written by Clare and various co - writers to accompany Clare 's novels ) ; he wrote these stories for Alec during their time apart , when he learned that he can not truly be in a loving relationship without sharing who he is .
He asks Alec for another chance , and Alec agrees .
At Jocelyn and Luke 's wedding in the Epilogue , it is revealed that Alec and Magnus have come to peace with their immortality - mortality conflict , and are now living together in Magnus ' Brooklyn loft .
As of Lady Midnight , Magnus and Alec are engaged and have two sons - Max Lightwood - Bane , a blue skinned warlock named after Alec 's younger brother Max Lightwood , who was killed in the Dark War , and Rafael Lightwood - Bane , an orphaned Shadowhunter named after Raphael Santiago .

Lady Midnight
* Lord of Shadows * Tales From the Shadowhunter Academy
* The Bane Chronicles * A History of Notable Shadowhunters & Denizens of the Downworld MAGNUS BANE Section::::Magnus Bane .
Magnus Bane is the High Warlock of Brooklyn .
He regularly tampered with the mind of Clary Fray after designing a spell that would erase her memories of the Shadow World once every two years as a favour to her mother , Jocelyn .
He first meets the other Shadowhunters at one of his Downworlder parties .
He later has Clary retrieve the Book of the White for him in City of Glass , and agrees to help revive her mother with it .
In City of Heavenly Fire , he admits to Alec that he is almost 400 years old , although he often lies about his age ( for instance , in " The Bane Chronicles " he claims to be under 300 years old , to which his friends Catarina Loss and Ragnor Fell laugh , obviously aware of the lie , and in " City of Glass " he claims to be 800 ) .
Despite his flamboyant appearance and whimsical personality , Magnus is a kind yet jaded person who yearns for love and acceptance , but has great trouble revealing his honest desires and personal secrets to others due to his long and traumatic past .
His life has frequently been entangled with the fates of certain Shadowhunters ( specifically the Herondale family during the Victorian and Edwardian eras , and the Fairchild family following the collapse of Valentine 's Circle ) , but he does n't become seriously involved with the workings of their society and their struggle for survival and reformation until he meets Alec Lightwood , who goes on to become the love of his life .
Physical appearance Magnus Bane is described as being of Asian descent , due to his human parent being half - Dutch , half - Indonesian .
He is an inch or two taller than Alec and is said to be lean , but not skinny , with lightly muscled arms .
He has brown skin and black , nearly shoulder - length hair that is usually styled and dyed .
He wears all kinds of makeup , such as glitter around his eyes and blue lipstick , and in City of Glass is also noted to own more makeup tools and accessories than even Isabelle Lightwood .
He likes to flaunt his bisexuality by wearing flashy and sometimes bizarre clothing .
Isabelle once described him as a " sexy , sexy warlock " , whereas Simon Lewis countered that Magnus " looks like a gay Sonic the Hedgehog and dresses like the Child Catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang .
" He also has gold - green eyes with vertical cat - like pupils and no belly button , both of which serve as his warlock marks .
He is portrayed by Godfrey Gao in the film adaptation of the book , and Harry Shum Jr. in the television series by Freeform .
Family Magnus ' mother and step - father began to fear him when he started nearing the age of ten , after they realised he was n't fully human .
It is revealed that his mother was in fact tricked into sleeping with a demon who disguised himself as her husband , and when she realized , some time after Magnus ' birth , that Magnus was a warlock ( in other words , someone half - human , half - demon ) and not her husband 's child , she hanged herself in her family 's barn in the novel while , in the TV show she slits her throat with a knife on her bed .
Soon after , his step - father tried to drown him in the novel but not in the TV show , and Magnus burned him alive in an attempt to save himself from his father .
He was then brought up by the Silent Brothers of Madrid , who also came up with his name .
Cassandra Clare revealed on Twitter that Magnus was born in what was once Batavia of the Dutch East Indies ( modern - day Jakarta , Indonesia ) .
Camille does state in City of Lost Souls that his biological father is a Prince of Hell , therefore implying he is a high - ranked demon .
Whenever asked who his father is , Magnus always avoids the question or changes the subject .
In City of Heavenly Fire , his father is revealed to be Asmodeus , the Greater Demon of Lust and ruler of Edom .
Because Asmodeus is also a fallen angel , Magnus is capable of interacting with witchlights â€” he can make them glow red .
Love interests
* Alexander " Alec " Lightwood ( boyfriend in City of Ashes , until their break up in City of Lost Souls ; the two reconcile and get back together in City of Heavenly Fire )
: Magnus and Alec meet during one of Magnus ' parties and Magnus openly flirts with him , eventually starting a secret relationship with him ( since Alec was not ready to come out as gay yet )
later on in the novel .
The couple 's relationship is revealed when Alec passionately kisses Magnus in front of the entire Clave right before a war is about to start in City of Glass however in the TV show
Alec kisses Magnus right in the middle of Alec 's arranged marriage to Lydia Branwell after he called of the wedding .
Alexander faces both public and private backlash ( from the Clave and his father , respectively ) because of this , but manages not to fully give in to his pain and frustration with some support from Magnus and Isabelle .
However , the couple encounter trouble when they openly face the fact that Alec is mortal and is bound to age and die , whereas Magnus , who is immortal , will remain young forever .
This , along with Magnus ' extensive sexual history and constant unwillingness to share anything about himself with Alec , causes heavy complications in their relationship , since Alec begins to believe he is trivial to Magnus , while Magnus insists this is not the case , but refuses to explain himself or give proof .
The two later break up during the epilogue of City of Lost Souls due to the fact that Alec had been visiting Camille Belcourt behind Magnus ' back after Camille suggested to Alec that Magnus had sought the Book of the White to turn him immortal , and had offered to help Alec find the Book of the White in order to turn Magnus mortal .
Alec briefly considers this but ultimately rejects it ; however , Magnus does find this out and initially accepts Camille 's " cover story " ( that Alec wanted to un - immortalise him ) as the truth .
The two part with one final kiss before Magnus reluctantly walks away , leaving a heartbroken Alec behind .
In The Infernal Devices we learn that Magnus has a thing for boys with dark hair and blue eyes , which matches Alec 's physical appearance .
In City of Heavenly Fire Alec tries to apologise to Magnus and get back together with him but Magnus refuses to talk to him or answer his texts or calls .
When all Shadowhunters are ordered to evacuate to Idris , Magnus goes to the Institute to say goodbye to Alec and kisses him .
Magnus makes it clear that he has forgiven Alec but can not resume his relationship with him due to their vastly different personal circumstances .
When Magnus is captured and sent to his father 's hell - dimension , Edom , Alexander goes on a suicide mission to rescue him and miraculously succeeds , with help from his family and friends .
The pair eventually get back together at the end of City of Heavenly Fire , with Alexander once again apologising for his mistakes and Magnus promising to be more open with Alec about himself and their relationship .
As of Lady Midnight , Magnus and Alec are engaged and have two sons â€” Max Lightwood - Bane , a blue - skinned warlock named for Alexander 's deceased brother , Maxwell Lightwood , and Rafael Lightwood - Bane , an orphaned Argentinian Shadowhunter named for the vampire Raphael Santiago .
Magnus has admitted that Alexander is the first and only Shadowhunter he has ever been in love with , as well as the only one of all his lovers with whom he has ever wanted to start a family .
* Lady Camille Belcourt ( The Infernal Devices ) is perhaps the most prominent of Magnus ' former lovers .
Their relationship and history is one of Magnus ' main plot lines in The Infernal Devices , having been lovers for many years before they eventually suffer a terrible misunderstanding that results in them severing ties .
The two meet again approximately a century after Clockwork Prince in City of Fallen Angels , when Camille is captured and refuses to talk to anyone else but Magnus .
This results in Magnus returning home , having been on a vacation with Alec at the time , and sees her for the first time in over a century .
She attempts to make amends with Magnus , saying that he must have known they would see each other again due to their immortality , but Magnus remains bitter about her abrupt departure from his life .
She begins to intentionally cause complications in his relationship with Alec by emotionally manipulating both him and Magnus , bringing up the topic of his immortality , and how since Alec was mortal , he would eventually die and leave Magnus behind .
However , Magnus firmly states that while she " can give him the past , Alec is his future " and leaves .
She then begins to meet with Alec in private in City of Lost Souls , since Alec seeks information about Magnus ' past because the warlock himself refuses to tell him anything and actively hides important details about his life from him , which makes Alexander doubt his worth in Magnus ' life .
During a later meeting , Camille informs Alec that unless he wants to use dark magic or become a vampire , there is no way to make him immortal .
She goes on to tell Alec , however , that if he really wants to be with Magnus forever , he would need to make Magnus a mortal , which she claims to be able to do .
While Alec briefly considers it , he ultimately refuses , unwilling to shorten Magnus ' life .
Despite this , she tells him to meet her at an abandoned subway station one last time , to tell her his final decision .
When Alec shows up at that meeting , ready to tell Camille he truthfully did not want to change Magnus , he instead finds Magnus there , who was told by Camille about the arrangement .
He tells Alec that Camille told him everything about the two 's private meetings , including that Alec was going to show up to accept her offer .
He says he did n't want to believe Camille , but when Alec showed up , he could no longer disregard what she told him .
This leads to the couple breaking up as a result of Camille 's deception .
* Woolsey Scott ( The Infernal Devices ) .
After leaving Camille , Magnus stayed with Woolsey for some time .
Magnus and Woolsey are not so much a romantic relationship but one of circumstance and housing as well as physical satisfaction .
* Imasu Morales ( revealed in The Bane Chronicles : What Really Happened in Peru ) .
Magnus met and fell in love with Imasu in 1890 , when he visited the city of Puno , in Peru , with Catarina and Ragnor .
As a result of their relationship , Magnus decided to learn how to play the musical instrument called charango , which he was terrible at .
They had a rather short vacation romance .
During the span of their relationship , Magnus never got around to telling Imasu about magic and his demonic origin .
Magnus had even considered offering that he and Imasu live together , before Imasu broke up with him , since he felt that Magnus as a person was too ephemeral .
Magnus laughed upon hearing this and told him that he was " the most permanent person " he would ever meet .
They never spoke to each other again after that .
* Etta ( revealed in The Bane Chronicles : Saving Raphael Santiago ) .
Magnus met Etta around 1938 at a club , where he asked her for a dance .
By the end of the song , Etta claimed to have fallen for him , while he said had fallen for her before the song had even begun .
The two started seeing each other , their relationship fairly serious , and Etta eventually learned what he really was â€” a warlock â€” and knew of the Shadow World .
It also became a tradition for the couple to dance in his room late at night when Magnus was unable to join her and dance with her at her club .
However , particularly by 1953 , Etta slowly realized that she might want a family .
When asked if she would want immortality , Etta said no , and insisted that while she would want more time with him , she is unwilling to stop time for herself to obtain that .
Eventually , Etta did leave him .
She did , however , remain a very well - remembered and cherished loved one of Magnus , and was the last person Magnus truly loved for over half a century , until Alec Lightwood .
* Kitty ( revealed in The Bane Chronicles : What Really Happened in Peru ) .
Kitty was a mundane who had a fling with Magnus in 1962 .
Presumably Latina , Kitty met Magnus at Cuzco in Peru .
Kitty was a con artist , and the couple went on a magical crime spree during the summer they were together .
* Axel von Ferson ( revealed in The Bane Chronicles : The Runaway Queen ) .
Magnus met Axel in Paris in 1791 when the count first met him , hoping to utilize his magic to help the imperilled royal family escape the country .
Magnus was instantly attracted to the man , who had his favorite physical combination â€” black hair and blue eyes .
After rescuing the queen , Marie Antoinette , Axel and his men found them .
While Axel said that his good deeds will be remembered , Magnus said that he only cared if he remembered .
Then impulsively , Axel kissed him before departing .
A few weeks later , Magnus , guilt stricken by the deaths of his loyal and kindhearted servants , received a letter from Axel 's sister , who asked for his help to stop her brother from attempting to save the king and queen , who got caught .
Magnus decided that mundane life was fleeting and chose not to involve himself any further .

Maia Roberts is a biracial teenager born and raised in a New Jersey suburban neighborhood .
Her brother , Daniel , was beautiful and abusive , though her parents never believed her , even when he broke her arm .
This treatment leads to Maia hating and fearing beautiful boys , even after her brother was killed in a hit - and - run .
In tenth - eleventh grade , Maia met Jordan Kyle and they began dating .
However , during their relationship , he soon began to become controlling and abusive and she broke up with him .
He became enraged at her break up with him and , in werewolf form , attacked her on her way home from a party .
( She was a mundane and did not know that he was a werewolf or anything about the Shadow World . )
Jordan vanished shortly afterward , and Maia soon turned into a werewolf on the next full moon .
She ran away from home and joined the wolf - pack in New York and became good friends with Luke , the leader of the pack .
She became associated with the Shadowhunters and develops a crush on Simon , and in City of Glass gets into a competition with Isabelle for his attention .
In City of Ashes , Maia leaves Luke 's apartment to apologize to Simon for her vicious reaction ( after she was attacked ) and realized he was a vampire .
On her way over to him , she is attacked by Agramon , the Demon of Fear which she interprets as her older brother Daniel who violently abused her when he was still alive .
Valentine then abducts her to drain her completely of blood so he can complete his spell .
Simon is kidnapped as well shortly after for his vampire blood .
It is learned that lycanthropes are negatively affected by all kinds of silver when Valentine sprinkles silver dust on her and she screams in pain .
At the beginning of City of Fallen Angels , Maia and Simon are casually dating , while Simon , not to her or Isabelle 's knowledge , ends up also casually dating Isabelle .
The truth of Simon 's actions comes out just as Maia runs into her ex - boyfriend Jordan Kyle .
Jordan , who had recently become acquainted with Simon , was the one who turned Maia into a werewolf .
However , Jordan 's actions were not what they seemed to be , as he had just become a new werewolf when he bit her and therefore unable to control his actions .
Maia is understandably angry to have him back in her life due to his abusiveness during their relationship and him turning her into a werewolf , but when she learns the truth behind what Jordan did , she understands and even seems to forgive him when realizing he is genuinely regretful of his past actions towards her .
Towards the end of the book , after she and Jordan have helped Isabelle and Alec look for Simon , she and Jordan kiss and eventually reaffirm their relationship .
Physical appearance
Maia is described as having curly , brown and gold hair ( her eyelashes are described as the color of toast ) , light brown skin and amber - brown eyes .

Daniel was said to be an attractive boy , but a very abusive brother to Maia
, It is said that he gave her bruises where they would n't be seen , breaking her arm , etc .
He died when he was hit by a car while at a young age , but Maia still felt afraid of him for many more years after .
Maia 's love interests *
Jordan Kyle : Maia is dating him as of City of Lost Souls .
They had dated back in high school , but when Jordan was turned into a werewolf he would , in result of the side effects on his body , constantly yell at her and became abusive towards her often slapping and hitting her , unaware of what he was doing to her .
Not knowing the cause of his sudden abusiveness , she broke it off with him , even kissing another guy to prove this to him .
Angered by this and it being the first full moon since he had been bit , Jordan turned into a werewolf for the first time and attacked and bit her during his angered emotions , which were much stronger due to the full moon , as she left a party .
Maia was never able to forgive him for what he did to her until she met him again in City of Fallen Angels after he had been to rehab ; truly regretful of his actions towards her and how he had treated her in the past and still very much in love with her .
Jordan even felt that he did not deserve a second chance with her on account of how badly he had treated her , feeling unworthy of her and that she deserved better than him .
The two , however , slowly begin to grow back together over time , eventually resulting in sharing several kisses ( and leading them to eventually sleep together on several different occasions ) and soon reaffirming their relationship on a clean slate .
In City of Heavenly Fire , he was murdered by Jonathan " Sebastian " Morgernstern .
* Simon Lewis : Maia had a crush on Simon upon meeting him and soon began to date him , though never seriously and more as a fling .
She broke up with him when she found out that he was also seeing Isabelle , although Simon did n't think things were serious between him and Maia as things never became exclusive .
This in which Maia eventually agrees on , saying it was n't " technically cheating " since she and Simon never made their relationship official .
The two eventually mend their friendship back together and remain good friends .
* Bat Velasquez : Maia had dated him for a some time after she became a werewolf .
Bat was also a part of Luke 's pack .
When Maia decides that she still needed space and was n't ready for a new relationship after her recent break up with Jordan Kyle , he accepts this and dates a witch .
It was mentioned in City of Heavenly Fire that he really did n't like the witch .
It was also shown in the ending of City of Heavenly Fire that when Bat and Maia were walking along the side of the lake in Luke 's farm that Bat held Maia 's hand which Maia did n't seem to mind .

Later in City of Lost Souls , after Luke is wounded by Sebastian and in critical condition , Jocelyn says to him how she regrets failing to have noticed his feelings for her back when they were younger and wishes he would have told her how he felt about her

Valentine Morgenstern is the main antagonist of the first half of the series , and is the former husband of Jocelyn Fairchild .
This also makes him biological father to Clarissa Morgenstern and Jonathan Christopher Morgenstern ( also known as Sebastian ) .
In his youth he was a very skilled Shadowhunter from a rich family in Alicante .
His best friend was Lucian Graymark while they were in school , among other Shadowhunters including Maryse Lightwood ( nÃ©e Trueblood ) , Robert Lightwood , Hodge Starkweather , Stephen Herondale and Michael Wayland .
Upon the death of his father , Valentine fell in love with Jocelyn Fairchild , and together he and his group of young Shadowhunters formed the infamous group known as the Circle .
With him leading the Circle , they had intended to share the gift of the Nephilim with the rest of humanity by using the Mortal Cup .
Valentine and Jocelyn married and all was well until his ideas for the Circle became more radical , as Valentine wanted to kill all Downworlders .
He infects his son with Demon blood and is betrayed by his former best friend , Lucian Graymark , and his wife at the Uprising of the Accords .
Upon fleeing the battle , Valentine is assumed to be dead and goes into hiding with his son and Jace Herondale .
Years later , when City of Bones begins , Valentine finds Jocelyn and wants her to reveal where the Mortal Cup is located .
He kidnaps her , but is unable to extract information from her due to her self - induced comatose state .
He eventually secures the Mortal Cup , and the Mortal Sword and goes to the Mortal Mirror to summon the Angel Raziel .
His arrogance , however , as well as his torturing of the angel Ithuriel , Raziel 's brother , causes the angel to slay him .

Valentine also adopts Jace Herondale as his son , training him as well as Jonathan , making him as skilled a Shadowhunter as Jonathan .
Valentine also experimented on his children .
Hoping to make a stronger and better Shadowhunter , he infused Jonathan with demon blood while in Jocelyn 's womb .
However , a side effect of the blood was that it would " burn out his [ Jonathan 's ] humanity as poison burns the life from blood .
"
This gave him a son capable of incredible feats , but with little to no compassion or ability to love .
The experimentation on Jonathan led to Jocelyn feeling sick and very depressed .
To make her feel better he gave her powdered Angel blood , not knowing that she was carrying a second child ( Clary ) , infusing Clary with Angel blood in the same way that Jonathan was with Demon blood .
With Jace , upon the failure of Jonathan to show any compassion , he gave Angel blood to Jace 's mother ( CelinÃ© Herondale ) , hoping to create a stronger warrior , without the side effects Jonathan suffered from the use Demon blood .
