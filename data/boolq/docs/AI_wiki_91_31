HAWAII ( ISLAND )
Hawaiʻi ( ; ) is the largest island located in the U.S. state of Hawaii .
It is the largest and the southeasternmost of the Hawaiian Islands , a chain of volcanic islands in the North Pacific Ocean .
With an area of , it has 63 % of the Hawaiian archipelago 's combined landmass , and is the largest island in the United States .
However , it has only 13 % of Hawaiʻi 's people .
The island of Hawaiʻi is the third largest island in Polynesia , behind the two main islands of New Zealand .
The island is often referred to as the Island of Hawaiʻi , the Big Island , or Hawaiʻi Island to distinguish it from the state .
Administratively , the whole island encompasses Hawaiʻi County .
As of the 2010 Census the population was 185,079 .
The county seat and largest city is Hilo .
There are no incorporated cities in Hawaiʻi County ( see List of counties in Hawaii ) .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Hawaiʻi is said to have been named after Hawaiʻiloa , the legendary Polynesian navigator who first discovered it .
Other accounts attribute the name to the legendary realm of Hawaiki , a place from which some Polynesian people are said to have originated , the place where they transition to in the afterlife , or the realm of the gods and goddesses .
Captain James Cook , the English explorer and navigator who was captain of the first European expedition that discovered the Hawaiian Islands , called them the " Sandwich Islands " after his patron , the Earl of Sandwich .
Cook was killed on the Big Island at Kealakekua Bay on 14 February 1779 , in a mêlée which followed the theft of a ship 's boat .
Hawaiʻi was the home island of Paiʻea Kamehameha , later known as Kamehameha the Great .
Kamehameha united most of the Hawaiian islands under his rule in 1795 , after several years of war , and gave the kingdom and the island chain the name of his native island .
GEOLOGY AND GEOGRAPHY Section::::Geology and geography .
According to the U.S. Census Bureau , the county has a total area of , of which is land and ( 20.8 % ) is water .
The county 's land area comprises 62.7 percent of the state 's land area .
It is the highest percentage by any county in the United States .
At its greatest dimension , the island is across .
It has a land area of comprising 62 % of the Hawaiian Islands ' land area .
Measured from its sea floor base to its highest peak , Mauna Kea is the world 's tallest mountain , taller than even Mount Everest , since the base of Mount Everest is above sea level .
Ka Lae , the southernmost point in the 50 states of the United States , is on Hawaii .
The nearest landfall to the south is in the Line Islands .
To the northwest of the island of Hawaii is the island of Maui , whose Haleakalā volcano is visible from Hawaii across the Alenuihaha Channel .
VOLCANISM Section::::Volcanism .
The island of Hawaiʻi is built from five separate shield volcanoes that erupted somewhat sequentially , one overlapping the other .
These are ( from oldest to youngest ) :
* Kohala – extinct * Mauna Kea – dormant * Hualālai – active * Mauna Loa – active , partly within Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park * Kīlauea – active : has been erupting continuously since 1983 ; part of Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park Geological evidence from exposures of old surfaces on the south and west flanks of Mauna Loa led to the proposal that two ancient volcanic shields ( named Ninole and Kulani ) were all but buried by the younger Mauna Loa .
Geologists now consider these " outcrops " to be part of the earlier building of Mauna Loa .
Because Mauna Loa and Kīlauea are active volcanoes , the island of Hawaii is still growing .
Between January 1983 and September 2002 , lava flows added to the island .
Lava flowing from Kīlauea has destroyed several towns , including Kapoho in 1960 , and Kalapana and Kaimū in 1990 .
In 1987 lava filled in " Queen 's Bath " , a large , L - shaped , freshwater pool in the Kalapana area .
Some geologists count seven volcanoes as building the island , which include the submarine volcanoes Māhukona and Lōʻihi as parts of the base of the island .
Māhukona off the northwest corner of the island has already disappeared below the surface of the ocean .
Approximately southeast of Hawaii lies the undersea volcano known as Lōʻihi .
It is an erupting seamount that now reaches approximately below the surface of the ocean .
Continued activity at current rates from Lōʻihi will likely cause it to break the surface of the ocean sometime between 10,000 and 100,000 years from now .
GREAT CRACK
Section::::Great Crack .
The Great Crack is an , and fissure in the island , in the district of Kau .
According to the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) , the Great Crack is the result of crustal dilation from magmatic intrusions into the southwest rift zone of Kilauea .
While neither the earthquake of 1868 nor that of 1975 caused a measurable change in the Great Crack , lava welled out of the lower of the Great Crack in 1823 .
Visitors can find trails , rock walls , and archaeological sites from as old as the 12th century around the Great Crack .
Approximately of private land were purchased during the presidency of Bill Clinton , specifically to protect various artifacts in this area , as well as the habitat of local wildlife .
HILINA SLUMP Section::::Hilina Slump .
The Hilina Slump is a section of the south slope of the Kīlauea volcano which is slipping away from the island .
Between 1990 and 1993 , Global Positioning System ( GPS ) measurements showed a southward displacement of about per year .
Undersea measurements show that a " bench " has formed a buttress and that this buttress may tend to reduce the likelihood of future catastrophic detachment .
EARTHQUAKES AND TSUNAMIS Section::::Earthquakes and tsunamis .
On 2 April 1868 , an earthquake with a magnitude estimated between 7.25 and 7.9 rocked the southeast coast of Hawaii .
This was the most destructive earthquake in the recorded history of Hawaii .
It triggered a landslide on Mauna Loa , north of Pahala , killing 31 people .
A tsunami claimed 46 more lives .
The villages of Punaluʻu , Nīnole , Kawaa , Honuapo , and Keauhou Landing were severely damaged .
The tsunami reportedly rolled over the tops of the coconut trees up to high , and it reached inland a distance of a quarter of a mile ( 400 meters ) in some places .
On 29 November 1975 , a section of the Hilina Slump dropped and slid toward the ocean .
This movement caused a 7.2 magnitude earthquake and a tsunami .
Oceanfront property was washed off its foundations in Punaluu .
Two deaths were reported at Halape , and 19 other people were injured .
The island suffered tsunami damage from earthquakes in Alaska on 1 April 1946 , and in Chile on 23 May 1960 .
Downtown Hilo was severely damaged by both tsunamis , with many lives lost .
Just north of Hilo , Laupāhoehoe lost 16 schoolchildren and five teachers in the tsunami of 1946 .
In March 2011 , a 9.0 magnitude earthquake off the east coast of Japan again created a tsunami that caused minor damage in Hawaii .
The estimated damage to public buildings alone was about US$ 3 million .
In the Kona area this tsunami washed a house into Kealakekua Bay , destroyed a yacht club and tour boat offices in Keauhou Bay , caused extensive damage in Kailua Kona , flooded the ground floor of the King Kamehameha Hotel , and permanently closed the Kona Village Resort .
In early May 2018 , hundreds of small earthquakes were detected on Kīlauea 's East rift zone , leading officials to issue evacuation warnings .
On 3 May 2018 , the volcano erupted in Puna after a 5.0 earthquake earlier in the day , causing evacuations of the Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens subdivisions .
A seemingly related 5.3 magnitude quake and a subsequent 6.9 magnitude earthquake occurred on 4 May. VOLCANIC FOG Section::::Volcanic fog .
Vog ( volcanic fog ) can envelop the island .
The gas plumes of the Kīlauea Volcano create a blanket of vog which the dominant trade winds mostly deflect toward the Kona coast on the west side of the island of Hawaiʻi .
Vog contains chemicals that can damage the environment and the health of plants , humans , and other animals .
Most of the aerosols are acidic and of a size where they can remain in the lungs to damage them and impair function .
Flu - like symptoms and general lethargy are reported , and are especially pronounced in people with respiratory conditions .

ECONOMY
Section::::Economy .
Sugarcane was the backbone of the island of Hawaiʻi 's economy for more than a century .
In the mid-20th century , sugarcane plantations began to downsize , and in 1996 the last plantation closed .
Most of the island 's economy is based on tourism , centered primarily in resort areas on the western coast of the island in the North Kona and South Kohala districts .
More recently , Hawaiʻi Island has become a focus for sustainable tourism .
Diversified agriculture is a growing sector of the economy .
Major crops include macadamia nuts , papaya , flowers , tropical and temperate vegetables , and coffee beans .
Only coffee grown in the Kona District of this island may be branded Kona coffee .
The island 's orchid agriculture is the largest in the state , and resulted in the unofficial nickname " The Orchid Isle " .
The island is home to one of the United States ' largest cattle ranches : Parker Ranch , on in Waimea .
The island is also known for astronomy , with numerous telescopes operated on the summit of Mauna Kea , where atmospheric clarity is excellent and there is little light pollution .
NELHA ( Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority ) , a state developed site , is a green economic development ocean science and technology park on the west side of the island .
It provides resources and facilities for energy and ocean - related research , education , and commercial activities in an environmentally sound and culturally sensitive manner .
Business tenants on this coastal site include microalgae farms , aquaculture , solar technology and marine biotech .
Tenants have access to three sets of pipelines delivering deep - sea water from a depth of up to , as well as pristine sea surface water and almost constant sunshine .
