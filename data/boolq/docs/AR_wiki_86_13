STYLE OF PLAY Section::::Style of play .
Rooney is a creative , energetic forward who combines technical skill with strength and physicality , while also excelling in the air despite being 5 ft 9 ins tall .
He is a versatile attacker , capable of playing anywhere along the front line ; although his preferred role is as a striker .
Rooney has also been used as a supporting forward , or even as a winger .
As his pace and movement declined as he entered his thirties , he has been deployed in a deeper , more creative role , as an attacking midfielder , or even as a central or box - to - box midfielder under former manager Louis van Gaal , due to his vision , range of passing , runs forward from midfield , and team - work .
A prolific goalscorer in his prime at Manchester United , Rooney is a powerful striker of the ball and an accurate finisher , who is capable of scoring goals both inside and outside the penalty area , as well as from volleys .
He has been praised for his work - rate and stamina by players , managers and the media , and is highly regarded for his dedication and willingness to press opponents when possession has been lost in order to win back the ball and start attacking plays .
Due to his precocious displays as a teenager , Wayne Rooney was given the nicknames " Wazza " ( a reference to former England international Paul " Gazza " Gascoigne , who was also a gifted player troubled by off - field issues ) , " The Wonder Boy " , and " the new Pelé " .
Rooney was a fast , agile player in his youth ; however , several injuries throughout his career , in addition to weight issues , affected his speed and mobility as his career progressed , which has led to some in the game accusing him of not quite living up to his full potential .
He was warned about his fitness on numerous occasions by his manager Ferguson , who said of Rooney , " He is very stocky , he is going to have to train well all the time . "
Manchester United fitness coach Mick Clegg , who believed Rooney was never as good as Cristiano Ronaldo because of the difference in their physique and application to gym work , stated , " Wayne did n't see the importance of the gym really .
He 'd say ' I 'm here to play football . "
Despite his reputation as one of the best player of his generation , and as one of England 's greatest ever players and all - time leading goalscorer , Rooney has been criticised for his behaviour and aggression on the pitch at times , which has led him to pick up unnecessary bookings .

It suggested a different church , five miles away .

However , Rooney was already with another representation firm at the time , while Stretford 's transaction went unreported to the FA , and he was thus charged with improper conduct .
Stretford alleged in his October 2004 trial that he had secretly recorded boxing promoter John Hyland and two other men threatening and attempting to blackmail him for an undisclosed percentage of Rooney 's earnings .
Stretford 's case collapsed due to evidence that conflicted with his insistence that he had not signed Rooney , and on 9 July 2008 , he was found guilty of " making of false and/or misleading witness statements to police , and giving false and/or misleading testimony " .
In addition , the contract to which Stretford had signed Rooney was two years longer than the limit allowed by the FA .
