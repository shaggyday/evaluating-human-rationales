GUN LAWS IN SWITZERLAND Firearms legislation in Switzerland allows the free purchase of semi - automatic , but not fully automatic firearms by Swiss citizens and foreigners with permanent residence .
Permits for concealed carrying in public are issued sparingly .
The acquisition of fully automatic weapons , suppressors and target lasers likewise requires special permits issued by the cantonal firearms office .
Use of hollow - point and soft - point ammunition is limited to hunting .
The applicable federal legislations are SR 514.54 Federal Law on Weapons , Weapon Equipment and Ammunition ( , , ) of 20 June 1997 ( current edition of 1 .
July 2016 , revised 01.01.1999 ) , and SR 514.541 Ordinance on Weapons , Armament Accessories and Ammunition ( , , ) of 2 July 2008 ( current edition of 1 .
July 2016 , revised 12.12.2008 ) .
The Weapons Law recognises a qualified " right to acquire , possess and carry arms " .
Swiss gun culture has emerged from a long tradition of shooting ( tirs ) , which served as a formative element of national identity in the post - Napoleonic Restoration of the Confederacy , and the long - standing practice of a militia organization of the Swiss Army in which soldiers ' service rifles are stored privately at their homes .
In addition to this , many cantons ( notably the alpine cantons of Grisons and Valais ) have strong traditions of hunting , accounting for a large but unknown number of privately held hunting rifles .
NUMBER OF GUNS IN CIRCULATION
Section::::Number of guns in circulation .
Switzerland thus has a relatively high gun ownership rate .
There are no official statistics , and estimates vary considerably .
The 2017 report from Small Arms Survey has estimated that the number of civilian - held firearms in Switzerland is of 2.332 million , which given a population of 8.4 million corresponds to a gun ownership of around 27.6 guns per 100 residents .
When Switzerland joined the Schengen Information System in 2008 , it was forced to introduce a central registry for firearms .
Only firearms which changed hands since 2008 are registered .
The number of registered firearms in this database was reported as 876,000 as of August 2017 .

27 WG / LArm ) , which in most cases is issued only to private citizens working in occupations such as security .
It is , however , quite common to see a person in military service to be en route with his rifle , albeit unloaded .
The issue of such exceptional permits are extremely selective ( see # Conditions_for_obtaining_a_Carrying_Permit ) .
However , it is permissible to carry firearms in public or outdoors if the holder ( art .

EU GUN BAN Section::::EU Gun Ban .
A 2017 amendment to the EU Firearms Directive , known as the " EU Gun Ban " , introduces new restrictions on firearms possession and acquisition , especially on semi - automatic firearms , personal defense weapons , magazine capacity , blank firing guns and historical firearms .
The restrictions must be introduced into the Swiss legal system by August 2018 due to its membership of the Schengen area .
The Directive also includes an exemption covering a specific Swiss issue โ it allows possession to a target shooter of one firearm used during the mandatory military period after leaving the army , provided it was converted to semi - automatic only ( art .
6(6 ) of the Amendment Directive ) .
This part of the Directive specifically was however challenged by the Czech Republic before the European Court of Justice due to its discriminatory nature .
The Czech Republic seeks nullification of the " Swiss exemption " as well as of other parts of the Directive .
Civil rights organizations plan to hold a referendum to reject the recent EU directive .
According to Swiss People 's Party vice - president Christoph Blocher , Switzerland should consider abandoning EU 's borderless Schengen Area if the Swiss people reject the proposed measures in a referendum .
ARMY - ISSUED ARMS AND AMMUNITION COLLECTION Section::::Army - issued arms and ammunition collection .
The Swiss army has long been a militia trained and structured to rapidly respond against foreign aggression .
Swiss males grow up expecting to undergo basic military training , usually at age 20 in the recruit school , the basic - training camp , after which Swiss men remain part of the " militia " in reserve capacity until age 30 ( age 34 for officers ) .
Prior to 2007 , members of the Swiss Militia were supplied with 50 rounds of ammunition for their military weapon in a sealed ammo box that was regularly audited by the government .
This was so that , in the case of an emergency , the militia could respond quickly .
In December 2007 , the Swiss Federal Council decided that the distribution of ammunition to soldiers would stop and that previously issued ammo would be returned .
By March 2011 , more than 99 % of the ammo has been received .
Only 2,000 specialist militia members ( who protect airports and other sites of particular sensitivity ) are permitted to keep their military - issued ammunition at home .
The rest of the militia get their ammunition from their military armory in the event of an emergency .
When their period of service has ended , militia men have the choice of keeping their personal weapon and other selected items of their equipment .
However , keeping the weapon after end of service requires a weapon acquisition permit ( art .
11 - 15 VPAA / OEPM ) .
The government sponsors training with rifles and shooting in competitions for interested adolescents , both male and female .
The sale of military - issued ammunitionincluding Gw Pat.90 rounds for army - issued assault riflesis subsidized by the Swiss government and made available at the many Federal Council licensed shooting ranges .
That ammunition sold at ranges must be immediately used there under supervision ( art .
16 WG / LArm ) .
The Swiss Army maintains tightened adherence to high standards of lawful military conduct .
In 2005 , for example , when the Swiss prosecuted recruits who had reenacted the torture scenes of Abu Ghraib , one of the charges was improper use of service weapons .
RECREATIONAL SHOOTING
Section::::Recreational shooting .
Recreational shooting is widespread in Switzerland .
Practice with guns is a popular form of recreation , and is encouraged by the government , particularly for the members of the militia .
Prior to the turn of the century , about 200,000 people used to attend the annual Eidgenรถssisches Feldschiessen , which is the largest rifle shooting competition in the world .
In 2012 they counted 130,000 participants .
For the 2015 Federal Shooting ( Eidg .
Schรผtzenfest )
37,000 shooters are registered .
In addition , there are several private shooting ranges which rent guns .
GUN CULTURE IN SWITZERLAND Section::::Gun culture in Switzerland .
Switzerland has a strong gun culture compared to other countries in the world .
Groups like ProTell lobby for the preservation of Switzerland 's gun rights .
Additionally , the Schweizerischer Schรผtzenverein , a Swiss shooting association , organizes the Eidgenรถssische Schรผtzenfeste , every five years and the Eidgenรถssisches Feldschiessen is held annually .
Every person with a swiss citizenship , aged 10 years or older , can take part at any federal ranges and will be able to shoot for free with the ordinance rifle .
Another possibility for the kids to shoot is the Young Shooters : the SAT ( lit .
shooting and off - duty activities ) oversees lessons in which Swiss children can learn how to shoot using the SIG SG 550 .
This activity is free and the Young Shooters are able to take home the rifle in - between the lessons if they are 17 .
For security reasons however , the breech has to stay at the range in which they attend the lesson .
This training takes place over a span of 6 years within a 3 - 4 month period each year and , if wanted , they can become instructors for the new generation of Young Shooters .
Traditionally liberal Swiss gun legislation has , however , been somewhat tightened in 2008 , when Switzerland has complied with European Firearms Directive .
Throughout the modern political history of Switzerland , there have been advocates for tighter gun control .
The most recent suggestion for tighter gun control was rejected in a popular referendum in February 2011 .
FIREARM - RELATED DEATHS Section::::Firearm - related deaths .
The vast majority of firearm - related deaths in Switzerland are suicides .
The suicide method of shooting oneself with a firearm accounted for 21.5 % of suicides in Switzerland in the period of 2001โ2012 ( with significant gender imbalance : 29.7 % of male suicides vs. 3.0 % of female suicides ) .
By contrast , gun crime is comparatively limited .
In 2016 , there were 187 attempted and 45 completed homicides , for a homicide rate of 0.50 per 100,000 population .
Of the recorded homicides ( attempted or completed ) , 20.3 % were committed with a gun ( 47 cases , compared to an average of 41 cases in the period of 2009โ2015 ) .
In addition , there were 7 cases of bodily harm and 233 cases of robbery committed with firearms .
There were 16 completed homicides with a firearm in 2016 .
Of these , 14 were committed with a handgun , one with a long gun and one case marked " other / unspecified " .
None of the involved weapons were ordinance weapons issued by the Swiss Armed Forces .
Similarly , out of 31 attempted homicides with firearms , 25 were committed with handguns , two with long guns and four " other / unspecified " , with no use of ordinance weapons on record .
For the period of 2009โ2016 , on average 16.5 out of 49.4 completed homicides were committed with a firearm , 13.8 with handguns , 1.9 with long guns and 0.9 " other / unspecified " ; an average 0.75 cases per year ( 6 cases in eight years ) involved ordinance weapons .
