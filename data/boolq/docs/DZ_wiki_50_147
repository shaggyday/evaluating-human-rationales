XBOX 360
The Xbox 360 is a home video game console developed by Microsoft .
As the successor to the original Xbox , it is the second console in the Xbox series .
It competed with Sony 's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo 's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles .
It was officially unveiled on MTV on May 12 , 2005 , with detailed launch and game information announced later that month at the 2005 E3 expo .
The Xbox 360 features an online service ,
Xbox Live , which was expanded from its previous iteration on the original Xbox and received regular updates during the console 's lifetime .
Available in free and subscription - based varieties , Xbox Live allows users to : play games online ; download games ( through Xbox Live Arcade ) and game demos ; purchase and stream music , television programs , and films through the Xbox Music and Xbox Video portals ; and access third - party content services through media streaming applications .
In addition to online multimedia features , it allows users to stream media from local PCs .
Several peripherals have been released , including wireless controllers , expanded hard drive storage , and the Kinect motion sensing camera .
The release of these additional services and peripherals helped the Xbox brand grow from gaming - only to encompassing all multimedia , turning it into a hub for living - room computing entertainment .
Launched worldwide across 2005–2006 , the Xbox 360 was initially in short supply in many regions , including North America and Europe .
The earliest versions of the console suffered from a high failure rate , indicated by the so - called " Red Ring of Death " , necessitating an extension of the device 's warranty period .
Microsoft released two redesigned models of the console : the Xbox 360 S in 2010 , and the Xbox 360 E in 2013 .
As of June 2014 , 84 million Xbox 360 consoles have been sold worldwide , making it the sixth - highest - selling video game console in history , and the highest - selling console made by an American company .
Although not the best - selling console of its generation , the Xbox 360 was deemed by TechRadar to be the most influential through its emphasis on digital media distribution and multiplayer gaming on Xbox Live .
The Xbox 360 's successor , the Xbox One , was released on November 22 , 2013 .
On April 20 , 2016 , Microsoft announced that it would end the production of new Xbox 360 hardware , although the company will continue to support the platform .
HISTORY DEVELOPMENT Section::::History .
Section::::Development .
Known during development as Xbox Next , Xenon , Xbox 2 , Xbox FS or NextBox , the Xbox 360 was conceived in early 2003 .
In February 2003 , planning for the Xenon software platform began , and was headed by Microsoft 's Vice President J Allard .
That month , Microsoft held an event for 400 developers in Bellevue , Washington to recruit support for the system .
Also that month , Peter Moore , former president of Sega of America , joined Microsoft .
On August 12 , 2003 , ATI signed on to produce the graphic processing unit for the new console , a deal which was publicly announced two days later .
Before the launch of the Xbox 360 , several Alpha development kits were spotted using Apple 's Power Mac G5 hardware .
This was because the system 's PowerPC 970 processor running the same PowerPC architecture that the Xbox 360 would eventually run under IBM 's Xenon processor .
The cores of the Xenon processor were developed using a slightly modified version of the PlayStation 3 's Cell Processor PPE architecture .
According to David Shippy and Mickie Phipps , the IBM employees were " hiding " their work from Sony and Toshiba , IBM 's partners in developing the Cell Processor .
Jeff Minter created the music visualization program Neon which is included with the Xbox 360 .
LAUNCH Section::::Launch .
The Xbox 360 was released on November 22 , 2005 , in the United States and Canada ; December 2 , 2005 , in Europe and December 10 , 2005 , in Japan .
It was later launched in Mexico , Brazil , Chile , Colombia , Hong Kong , Singapore , South Korea , Taiwan , Australia , New Zealand , South Africa , India , and Russia .
In its first year on the market , the system launched in 36 countries , more countries than any other console has launched in a single year .
CRITICAL RECEPTION Section::::Critical reception .
In 2009 , IGN named the Xbox 360 the sixth - greatest video game console of all time , out of a field of 25 .
Although not the best - selling console of the seventh - generation , the Xbox 360 was deemed by TechRadar to be the most influential , by emphasizing digital media distribution and online gaming through Xbox Live , and by popularizing game achievement awards .
PC Magazine considered the Xbox 360 the prototype for online gaming as it " proved that online gaming communities could thrive in the console space " .
Five years after the Xbox 360 's original debut , the well - received Kinect motion capture camera was released , which set the record of being the fastest selling consumer electronic device in history , and extended the life of the console .
Edge ranked Xbox 360 the second - best console of the 1993–2013 period , stating " It had its own social network , cross - game chat , new indie games every week , and the best version of just about every multiformat game ...
Killzone is no Halo and nowadays Gran Turismo is no Forza , but it 's not about the exclusives — there 's nothing to trump Naughty Dog 's PS3 output , after all .
Rather , it 's about the choices Microsoft made back in the original Xbox 's lifetime .
The PC - like architecture meant the early EA Sports games ran at 60fps compared to only 30 on PS3 , Xbox Live meant every dedicated player had an existing friends list , and Halo meant Microsoft had the killer next - generation exclusive .
And when developers demo games on PC now they do it with a 360 pad — another industry benchmark , and a critical one . "
SALES Section::::Sales . !

First available November 22 , 2005
The Xbox 360 began production only 69 days before launch , and Microsoft was not able to supply enough systems to meet initial consumer demand in Europe or North America , selling out completely upon release in all regions except in Japan .
Forty thousand units were offered for sale on auction site eBay during the initial week of release , 10 % of the total supply .
By year 's end , Microsoft had shipped 1.5 million units , including 900,000 in North America , 500,000 in Europe , and 100,000 in Japan .
In May 2008 Microsoft announced that 10 million Xbox 360s had been sold and that it was the " first current generation gaming console " to surpass the 10 million figure in the US .
In the US , the Xbox 360 was the leader in current - generation home console sales until June 2008 , when it was surpassed by the Wii .
The Xbox 360 has sold a total of 870,000 units in Canada as of August 1 , 2008 .
Between January 2011 and October 2013 , the Xbox 360 was the best - selling console in the United States for these 32 consecutive months .
In Europe , the Xbox 360 has sold seven million units as of November 20 , 2008 , according to Microsoft .
In the United Kingdom , the Xbox 360 has sold 3.9 million units as of June 27 , 2009 , according to GfK Chart - Track .
While the original Xbox sold poorly in Japan , selling just 450,000 by November 2011 , the Xbox 360 sold almost as poorly , selling only 1.5 million units from 2005 to 2011 .
Edge magazine reported in August 2011 that initially lackluster and subsequently falling sales in Japan , where Microsoft had been unable to make serious inroads into the dominance of domestic rivals Sony and Nintendo , had led to retailers scaling down and in some cases discontinuing sales of the Xbox 360 completely .
The significance of Japan 's poor sales might be overstated in the media in comparison to overall international sales .
LEGACY Section::::Legacy .
The Xbox 360 sold much better than its predecessor , and although not the best - selling console of the seventh generation , it is regarded as a success since it strengthened Microsoft as a major force in the console market at the expense of well - established rivals .
The inexpensive Nintendo Wii did sell the most console units but eventually saw a collapse of third - party software support in its later years , and it has been viewed by some as a fad since the succeeding Wii U had a poor debut in 2012 .
The PlayStation 3 struggled for a time due to being too expensive and initially lacking quality games , making it far less dominant than its predecessor , the PlayStation 2 , and it took until late in the PlayStation 3 's lifespan for its sales and games to reach parity with the Xbox 360 .
TechRadar proclaimed that " Xbox 360 passes the baton as the king of the hill – a position that puts all the more pressure on its successor , Xbox One " .
The Xbox 360 's advantage over its competitors was due to the release of high - profile games from both first party and third party developers .
The 2007 Game Critics Awards honored the platform with 38 nominations and 12 wins – more than any other platform .
By March 2008 , the Xbox 360 had reached a software attach rate of 7.5 games per console in the US ; the rate was 7.0 in Europe , while its competitors were 3.8 ( PS3 ) and 3.5 ( Wii ) , according to Microsoft .
At the 2008 Game Developers Conference , Microsoft announced that it expected over 1,000 games available for Xbox 360 by the end of the year .
As well as enjoying exclusives such as additions to the Halo franchise and Gears of War , the Xbox 360 has managed to gain a simultaneous release of games that were initially planned to be PS3 exclusives , including Devil May Cry 4 , Ace Combat 6 , Virtua Fighter 5 , Grand Theft Auto IV , Final Fantasy XIII , Tekken 6 , , and L.A. Noire .
In addition , Xbox 360 versions of cross - platform games were generally considered superior to their PS3 counterparts in 2006 and 2007 , due in part to the difficulties of programming for the PS3 .
TechRadar deemed the Xbox 360 as the most influential game system through its emphasis of digital media distribution , Xbox Live online gaming service , and game achievement feature .
During the console 's lifetime , the Xbox brand has grown from gaming - only to encompassing all multimedia , turning it into a hub for " living - room computing environment " .
Five years after the Xbox 360 's original debut , the well - received Kinect motion capture camera was released , which became the fastest selling consumer electronic device in history , and extended the life of the console .
Microsoft announced the Xbox One , successor to the Xbox 360 , at E3 on June 10 , 2013 .
Although succeeded as Microsoft 's main console by the Xbox One , support from publishers for the Xbox 360 is expected to continue until at least 2016 .
On April 20 , 2016 , Microsoft announced the end of production of new Xbox 360 hardware ; the company will continue to provide hardware and software support for the platform , as selected Xbox 360 games can be played on Xbox One .

It features a port on the top when vertical ( left side when horizontal ) to which a custom - housed hard disk drive unit can be attached .
On the Slim and E models , the hard drive bay is on the bottom when vertical ( right side when horizontal ) and requires the opening of a concealed door to access it .
( This does not void the warranty . )
The Xbox 360 Slim / E hard drives are standard 2.5 " SATA laptop drives , but have a custom enclosure and firmware so that the Xbox 360 can recognize it .

TECHNICAL PROBLEMS
Section::::Technical problems .
The Xbox 360 ( not Slim and E models ) has been subject to a number of technical problems .
Since the console 's release in 2005 , users have reported concerns over its reliability and failure rate .
To aid customers with defective consoles , Microsoft extended the Xbox 360 's manufacturer 's warranty to three years for hardware failure problems that generate a " General Hardware Failure " error report .
A " General Hardware Failure " is recognized on all models released before the Xbox 360 S by three quadrants of the ring around the power button flashing red .
This error is often known as the " Red Ring of Death " .
In April 2009 the warranty was extended to also cover failures related to the E74 error code .
The warranty extension is not granted for any other types of failures that do not generate these specific error codes .
Since these problems surfaced , Microsoft has attempted to modify the console to improve its reliability .
Modifications include a reduction in the number , size , and placement of components , the addition of dabs of epoxy on the corners and edges of the CPU and GPU as glue to prevent movement relative to the board during heat expansion , and a second GPU heatsink to dissipate more heat .
With the release of the redesigned Xbox 360 S , the warranty for the newer models does not include the three - year extended coverage for " General Hardware Failures " .
The newer Xbox 360 S and E models indicate system overheating when the console 's power button begins to flash red , unlike previous models where the first and third quadrant of the ring would light up red around the power button if overheating occurred .
The system will then warn the user of imminent system shutdown until the system has cooled , whereas a flashing power button that alternates between green and red is an indication of a " General Hardware Failure " unlike older models where three of the quadrants would light up red .
SOFTWARE GAMES Section::::Software .
Section::::Games .
The Xbox 360 launched with 14 games in North America and 13 in Europe .
The console 's best - selling game for 2005 , Call of Duty 2 , sold over a million copies .
Five other games sold over a million copies in the console 's first year on the market :
Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter , , Dead or Alive 4 , Saints Row , and Gears of War .
Gears of War would become the best - selling game on the console with 3 million copies in 2006 , before being surpassed in 2007 by Halo 3 with over 8 million copies .
Six games were initially available in Japan , while eagerly anticipated games such as Dead or Alive 4 and Enchanted Arms were released in the weeks following the console 's launch .
Games targeted specifically for the region , such as Chromehounds , Ninety - Nine Nights , and Phantasy Star Universe , were also released in the console 's first year .
Microsoft also had the support of Japanese developer Mistwalker , founded by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi .
Mistwalker 's first game , Blue Dragon , was released in 2006 and had a limited - edition bundle which sold out quickly with over 10,000 pre - orders .
Blue Dragon is one of three Xbox 360 games to surpass 200,000 units in Japan , along with Tales of Vesperia and .
Mistwalker 's second game , Lost Odyssey also sold over 100,000 copies .
The 2007 Game Critics Awards honored the Xbox 360 platform with 38 Nominations and 11 Wins .
INTERFACE Section::::Interface .
The Xbox 360 's original graphical user interface was the Xbox 360 Dashboard ; a tabbed interface that featured five " Blades " ( formerly four blades ) , and was designed by AKQA and Audiobrain .
It could be launched automatically when the console booted without a disc in it , or when the disc tray was ejected , but the user had the option to select what the console does if a game is in the tray on start up , or if inserted when already on .
A simplified version of it was also accessible at any time via the Xbox Guide button on the gamepad .
This simplified version showed the user 's gamercard , Xbox Live messages and friends list .
It also allowed for personal and music settings , in addition to voice or video chats , or returning to the Xbox Dashboard from the game .
On November 19 , 2008 , the Xbox 360 's dashboard was changed from the " Blade " interface , to a dashboard reminiscent of that present on the Zune and Windows Media Center , known as the " New Xbox Experience " or NXE .
Since the console 's release , Microsoft has released several updates for the Dashboard software .
These updates have included adding new features to the console , enhancing Xbox Live functionality and multimedia playback capabilities , adding compatibility for new accessories , and fixing bugs in the software .
Such updates are mandatory for users wishing to use Xbox Live , as access to Xbox Live is disabled until the update is performed .
NEW XBOX EXPERIENCE Section::::New Xbox Experience .
At E3 2008 , at Microsoft 's Show , Microsoft 's Aaron Greenberg and Marc Whitten announced the new Xbox 360 interface called the " New Xbox Experience " ( NXE ) .
The update was intended to ease console menu navigation .
Its GUI uses the Twist UI , previously used in Windows Media Center and the Zune .
Its new Xbox Guide retains all Dashboard functionality ( including the Marketplace browser and disk ejection ) and the original " Blade " interface ( although the color scheme has been changed to match that of the NXE Dashboard ) .
The NXE also provides many new features .
Users can now install games from disc to the hard drive to play them with reduced load time and less disc drive noise , but each game 's disc must remain in the system in order to run .
A new , built - in Community system allows the creation of digitized Avatars that can be used for multiple activities , such as sharing photos or playing Arcade games like 1 vs. 100 .
The update was released on November 19 , 2008 .
While previous system updates have been stored on internal memory , the NXE update was the first to require a storage device — at least a 128 MB memory card or a hard drive .
Microsoft released a further update to the Xbox 360 Dashboard starting on December 6 , 2011 .
It included a completely new user interface which utilizes Microsoft 's Metro design language , and added new features such as cloud storage for game saves and profiles , live television , Bing voice search , access to YouTube videos and better support for Kinect voice commands .
MULTIMEDIA Section::::Multimedia .
The Xbox 360 supports videos in Windows Media Video ( WMV ) format ( including high - definition and PlaysForSure videos ) , as well as H.264 and MPEG-4 media .
The December 2007 dashboard update added support for the playback of MPEG-4 ASP format videos .
The console can also display pictures and perform slideshows of photo collections with various transition effects , and supports audio playback , with music player controls accessible through the Xbox 360 Guide button .
Users may play back their own music while playing games or using the dashboard , and can play music with an interactive visual synthesizer .
Music , photos and videos can be played from standard USB mass storage devices , Xbox 360 proprietary storage devices ( such as memory cards or Xbox 360 hard drives ) , and servers or computers with Windows Media Center or Windows XP with Service pack 2 or higher within the local - area network in streaming mode .
As the Xbox 360 uses a modified version of the UPnP AV protocol , some alternative UPnP servers such as uShare ( part of the GeeXboX project ) and MythTV can also stream media to the Xbox 360 , allowing for similar functionality from non - Windows servers .
This is possible with video files up to HD - resolution and with several codecs ( MPEG-2 , MPEG-4 , WMV ) and container formats ( WMV , MOV , TS ) .
As of October 27 , 2009 , UK and Ireland users are also able to access live and on - demand streams of Sky television programming .
At the 2007 , 2008 , and 2009 Consumer Electronics Shows , Microsoft had announced that IPTV services would soon be made available to use through the Xbox 360 .
In 2007 , Microsoft chairman Bill Gates stated that IPTV on Xbox 360 was expected to be available to consumers by the holiday season , using the Microsoft TV IPTV Edition platform .
In 2008 , Gates and president of Entertainment & Devices
Robbie Bach announced a partnership with BT in the United Kingdom , in which the BT Vision advanced TV service , using the newer Microsoft Mediaroom IPTV platform , would be accessible via Xbox 360 , planned for the middle of the year .
BT Vision 's DVR - based features would not be available on Xbox 360 due to limited hard drive capacity .
In 2010 , while announcing version 2.0 of Microsoft Mediaroom , Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer mentioned that AT&T 's U - verse IPTV service would enable Xbox 360s to be used as set - top boxes later in the year .
As of January 2010 , IPTV on Xbox 360 has yet to be deployed beyond limited trials .
In 2012 , Microsoft released the Live Event Player , allowing for events such as video game shows , beauty pageants , award shows , concerts , news and sporting events to be streamed on the console via Xbox Live .
The first live events streamed on Live were the 2012 Revolver Golden Gods , Microsoft 's E3 2012 media briefing and the Miss Teen USA 2012 beauty pageant .
XNA COMMUNITY Section::::XNA community .
XNA Community is a feature whereby Xbox 360 owners can receive community - created games , made with Microsoft XNA Game Studio , from the XNA Creators Club .
The games are written , published , and distributed through a community managed portal .
XNA Community provides a channel for digital videogame delivery over Xbox Live that can be free of royalties , publishers and licenses .
XNA game sales , however , did not meet original expectations .
though Xbox Live Indie Games ( XBLIG ) has had some " hits . "
