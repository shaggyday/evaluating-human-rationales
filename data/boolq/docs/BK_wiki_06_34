The bachelor party dates back as early as the 5th century B.C.
The ancient Spartans celebrated the groom 's last night as a single man in which they held a dinner and made toasts on his behalf .
In 1896 , Herbert Barnum Seeley , a grandson of P. T. Barnum , threw a stag party ( known as the " Awful Seeley Dinner " ) for his brother at restaurant Sherry 's in New York City .
The party had a dancer , nicknamed " Little Egypt " , who allegedly danced naked in desserts .
The party was dissolved in the early morning by an officer .
Afterwards , the Seeley family brought the police officer to the police board trial for " conduct unbecoming to an officer of the law . "
At that time , that incident brought the light to the " behind closed doors " matters with bachelor parties .
The term " bachelor " , originally meaning " a young knight - in - training " , was firstly mentioned in the 14th century to refer to an unmarried man in Geoffrey Chaucer 's The Canterbury Tales .
