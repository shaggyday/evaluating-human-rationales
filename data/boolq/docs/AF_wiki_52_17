STATE OF THE UNION
The State of the Union Address is an annual message presented by the President of the United States to a joint session of the United States Congress , except in the first year of a new president 's term .
The message includes a budget message and an economic report of the nation , and also allows the President to propose a legislative agenda ( for which the cooperation of Congress is needed ) and national priorities .
The address fulfills rules in of the U.S. Constitution , requiring the President to periodically " give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union , and recommend to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient .
"
During most of the country 's first century , the President primarily only submitted a written report to Congress .
After 1913 , Woodrow Wilson , the 28th U.S. President , began the regular practice of delivering the address to Congress in person as a way to rally support for the President 's agenda .
With the advent of radio and television , the address is now broadcast live across the country on many networks .
CEREMONY Section::::Ceremony .
The practice arises from a duty given to the president in the Constitution of the United States :
Although the language of this State of the Union Clause of the Constitution is not specific , since the 1930s , the President makes this report annually in late January or early February .
Between 1934 and 2013 the date has been as early as January 3 , and as late as February 12 .
While not required to deliver a speech , every president since Woodrow Wilson , with the notable exception of Herbert Hoover , has made at least one State of the Union report as a speech delivered before a joint session of Congress .
Before that time , most presidents delivered the State of the Union as a written report .
Since Franklin Roosevelt , the State of the Union is given typically each January before a joint session of the United States Congress and is held in the House of Representatives chamber of the United States Capitol .
Newly inaugurated presidents generally deliver an address to Congress in February of the first year of their term , but this speech is not officially considered to be a " State of the Union " .
What began as a communication between president and Congress has become in effect a communication between the president and the people of the United States .
Since the advent of radio , and then television , the speech has been broadcast live on most networks , preempting scheduled programming .
To reach the largest audience , the speech , once given during the day , is now typically given in the evening , after 9 pm ET ( UTC-5 ) .
HISTORY Section::::History .
George Washington delivered the first regular annual message before a joint session of Congress on January 8 , 1790 , in New York City , then the provisional U.S. capital .
In 1801 , Thomas Jefferson discontinued the practice of delivering the address in person , regarding it as too monarchical ( similar to the Speech from the Throne ) .
Instead , the address was written and then sent to Congress to be read by a clerk until 1913 when Woodrow Wilson re - established the practice despite some initial controversy .
However , there have been exceptions to this rule .
Presidents during the latter half of the 20th century have sent written State of the Union addresses .
The last President to do this was Jimmy Carter in 1981 , after his defeat by Ronald Reagan and days before his term ended .
For many years , the speech was referred to as " the President 's Annual Message to Congress " .
The actual term " State of the Union " first emerged in 1934 when Franklin D. Roosevelt used the phrase , becoming its generally accepted name since 1947 .
Prior to 1934 , the annual message was delivered at the end of the calendar year , in December .
The ratification of the 20th Amendment on January 23 , 1933 , changed the opening of Congress from early March to early January , affecting the delivery of the annual message .
Since 1934 , the message or address has been delivered to Congress in January or February .
The Twentieth Amendment also established January 20 as the beginning of the presidential term .
In years when a new president is inaugurated , the outgoing president may deliver a final State of the Union message , but none has done so since Jimmy Carter sent a written message in 1981 .
In 1953 and 1961 , Congress received both a written State of the Union message from the outgoing president and a separate State of the Union speech by the incoming president .
Since 1989 , in recognition that the responsibility of reporting the State of the Union formally belongs to the president who held office during the past year , newly inaugurated Presidents have not officially called their first speech before Congress a " State of the Union " message .
In 1936 , President Roosevelt set a precedent when he delivered the address at night .
Only once before — when Woodrow Wilson asked Congress to order the U.S. into World War I —
had a sitting president addressed Congress at night .
Warren Harding 's 1922 speech was the first to be broadcast on radio , albeit to a limited audience , while Calvin Coolidge 's 1923 speech was the first to be broadcast across the nation .
Harry S. Truman 's 1947 address was the first to be broadcast on television .
Lyndon B. Johnson 's address in 1965 was the first delivered in the evening .
Three years later , in 1968 , television networks in the United States , for the first time , imposed no time limit for their coverage of a State of the Union address .
Delivered by Lyndon B. Johnson , this address was followed by extensive televised commentary by , among others , Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Milton Friedman .
Ronald Reagan 's 1986 State of the Union Address is the only one to have been postponed .
He had planned to deliver it on January 28 , 1986 but postponed it for a week after learning of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster and instead addressed the nation on the day 's events .
Bill Clinton 's 1997 address was the first broadcast available live on the World Wide Web .
DELIVERY OF THE SPEECH
Section::::Delivery of the speech .
A formal invitation is made by the Speaker of the House to the President several weeks before each State of the Union Address .
INVITATIONS Section::::Invitations .
Every member of Congress can bring one guest to the State of the Union address .
The President may invite up to 24 guests with the First Lady in her box .
The Speaker of the House may invite up to 24 guests in the Speaker 's box .
Seating for Congress on the main floor is by a first - in , first - served basis with no reservations .
The Cabinet , Supreme Court justices , members of the Diplomatic Corps , and Joint Chiefs have reserved seating .
PROTOCOL OF ENTRY INTO HOUSE CHAMBER Section::::Protocol of entry into House chamber .
By approximately 8:30 pm on the night of the address , the members of the House have gathered in their seats for the joint session .
Then , the Deputy Sergeant at Arms addresses the Speaker and loudly announces the Vice President and members of the Senate , who enter and take the seats assigned for them .
The Speaker , and then the Vice President , specify the members of the House and Senate , respectively , who will escort the President into the House chamber .
The Deputy Sergeant at Arms addresses the Speaker again and loudly announces , in order , the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps , the Chief Justice of the United States and the Associate Justices , and the Cabinet , each of whom enters and takes their seats when called .
The justices take the seats nearest to the Speaker 's rostrum and adjacent to the sections reserved for the Cabinet and the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
Just after 9 pm , as the President reaches the door to the chamber , the House Sergeant at Arms stands just inside the doors , faces the Speaker , and waits until the President is ready to enter the chamber .
When the President is ready , the Sergeant at Arms always announces the entrance , loudly stating the phrase : " Mister [ or Madam ] Speaker , the President of the United States ! "
As applause and cheering begins , the President slowly walks toward the Speaker 's rostrum , followed by members of the Congressional escort committee .
The President 's approach is slowed by pausing to shake hands , hug , kiss , and autograph copies of the speech for Members of Congress .
After taking a place at the House Clerk 's desk , the President hands two manila envelopes , previously placed on the desk and containing copies of the speech , to the Speaker and Vice President .
After continuing applause from the attendees has diminished , the Speaker introduces the President to the Representatives and Senators , stating : " Members of Congress , I have the high privilege and distinct honor of presenting to you the President of the United States .
" This leads to a further round of applause and , eventually , the beginning of the address by the President .
At close of the ceremony , attendees leave on their own accord .
The Sergeants at Arms guides the President out of the Chamber .
Some politicians stay to shake hands with and congratulate the President on the way out .
DESIGNATED SURVIVOR AND OTHER LOGISTICS Section::::Designated survivor and other logistics .
Customarily , one cabinet member ( the designated survivor ) does not attend the speech , in order to provide continuity in the line of succession in the event that a catastrophe disables the President , the Vice President , and other succeeding officers gathered in the House chamber .
Additionally , since the September 11 attacks in 2001 , a few members of Congress have been asked to relocate to undisclosed locations for the duration of the speech to form a rump Congress in the event of a disaster .
Since 2003 , each chamber of Congress has formally named a separate designated survivor .
Both the Speaker and the Vice President sit at the Speaker 's desk , behind the President for the duration of the speech .
If either is unavailable , the next highest - ranking member of the respective house substitutes .
Once the chamber settles down from the President 's arrival , the Speaker officially presents the President to the joint session of Congress .
The President then delivers the speech from the podium at the front of the House Chamber .
In the State of the Union the President traditionally outlines the administration 's accomplishments over the previous year , as well as the agenda for the coming year , often in upbeat and optimistic terms .
Since the 1982 address , it has also become common for the President to honor special guests sitting in the gallery , such as American citizens or visiting heads of state .
During that 1982 address , President Ronald Reagan acknowledged Lenny Skutnik for his act of heroism following the crash of Air Florida Flight 90 .
Since then , the term " Lenny Skutniks " has been used to refer to individuals invited to sit in the gallery , and then cited by the President , during the State of the Union .
State of the Union speeches usually last a little over an hour , partly because of the large amounts of applause that occur from the audience throughout .
The applause is often political in tone , with many portions of the speech being applauded only by members of the President 's own party .
As non - political officeholders , members of the Supreme Court or the Joint Chiefs of Staff rarely applaud in order to retain the appearance of political impartiality .
In recent years , the presiding officers of the House and the Senate , the Speaker and the Vice President , respectively , have departed from the neutrality expected of presiding officers of deliberative bodies , as they , too , stand and applaud in response to the remarks of the President with which they agree .
For the 2011 address , Senator Mark Udall of Colorado proposed a break in tradition wherein all members of Congress sit together regardless of party , as well as the avoiding of standing ; this was in response to the 2011 Tucson Shooting in which Representative Gabrielle Giffords was shot and wounded in an assassination attempt .
This practice was also repeated during the 2012 address and every address after .
OPPOSITION RESPONSE Section::::Opposition response .
Since 1966 , the speech has been followed on television by a response or rebuttal by a member of the major political party opposing the President 's party .
The response is typically broadcast from a studio with no audience .
In 1970 , the Democratic Party put together a TV program with their speech to reply to President Nixon , as well as a televised response to Nixon 's written speech in 1973 .
The same was done by Democrats for President Reagan 's speeches in 1982 and 1985 .
The response is not always produced in a studio ; in 1997 , the Republicans for the first time delivered the response in front of high school students .
In 2004 , the Democratic Party 's response was also delivered in Spanish for the first time , by New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson .
In 2011 , Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann also gave a televised response for the Tea Party Express , a first for a political movement .
SIGNIFICANCE Section::::Significance .
Although much of the pomp and ceremony behind the State of the Union address is governed by tradition rather than law , in modern times , the event is seen as one of the most important in the US political calendar .
It is one of the few instances when all three branches of the US government are assembled under one roof : members of both houses of Congress constituting the legislature , the President 's Cabinet constituting the executive , and the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court constituting the judiciary .
In addition , the military is represented by the Joint Chiefs of Staff , while foreign governments are represented by the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps .
The address has also been used as an opportunity to honor the achievements of some ordinary Americans , who are typically invited by the President to sit with the First Lady .

The American people want action , and it will take both the Congress and the President to give them what they want .
Progress and solutions can be achieved , and they will be achieved . "
