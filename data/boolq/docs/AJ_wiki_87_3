APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS
The Appalachian Mountains ( ) , often called the Appalachians , are a system of mountains in eastern North America .
The Appalachians first formed roughly 480 million years ago during the Ordovician Period .
They once reached elevations similar to those of the Alps and the Rocky Mountains before experiencing natural erosion .
The Appalachian chain is a barrier to east - west travel , as it forms a series of alternating ridgelines and valleys oriented in opposition to most highways and railroads running east - west .
Definitions vary on the precise boundaries of the Appalachians .
The United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) defines the Appalachian Highlands physiographic division as consisting of thirteen provinces : the Atlantic Coast Uplands , Eastern Newfoundland Atlantic , Maritime Acadian Highlands , Maritime Plain , Notre Dame and Mégantic Mountains , Western Newfoundland Mountains , Piedmont , Blue Ridge , Valley and Ridge , Saint Lawrence Valley , Appalachian Plateaus , New England province , and the Adirondack areas .
A common variant definition does not include the Adirondack Mountains , which geologically belong to the Grenville Orogeny and have a different geological history from the rest of the Appalachians .
OVERVIEW
Section::::Overview .
The mountain range is mostly in the United States ( U.S. ) but it extends into southeastern Canada , forming a zone from wide , running from the island of Newfoundland southwestward to Central Alabama in the United States .
The range covers parts of the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon , which comprise an overseas territory of France .
The system is divided into a series of ranges , with the individual mountains averaging around .
The highest of the group is Mount Mitchell in North Carolina at , which is the highest point in the United States east of the Mississippi River .
The term Appalachian refers to several different regions associated with the mountain range .
Most broadly , it refers to the entire mountain range with its surrounding hills and the dissected plateau region .
The term is often used more restrictively to refer to regions in the central and southern Appalachian Mountains , usually including areas in the states of Kentucky , Tennessee , Virginia , Maryland , West Virginia , and North Carolina , as well as sometimes extending as far south as northern Alabama , Georgia and western South Carolina , and as far north as Pennsylvania , southern Ohio , and parts of southern upstate New York .
The Ouachita Mountains in Arkansas and Oklahoma were originally part of the Appalachians as well but became disconnected through geologic history .
ORIGIN OF THE NAME Section::::Origin of the name .
While exploring inland along the northern coast of Florida in 1528 , the members of the Narváez expedition , including Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca , found a Native American village near present - day Tallahassee , Florida whose name they transcribed as Apalchen or Apalachen .
The name was soon altered by the Spanish to Apalachee and used as a name for the tribe and region spreading well inland to the north .
Pánfilo de Narváez 's expedition first entered Apalachee territory on June 15 , 1528 , and applied the name .
Now spelled " Appalachian , " it is the fourth - oldest surviving European place - name in the US .
After the de Soto expedition in 1540 , Spanish cartographers began to apply the name of the tribe to the mountains themselves .
The first cartographic appearance of Apalchen is on Diego Gutierrez 's map of 1562 ; the first use for the mountain range is the map of Jacques le Moyne de Morgues in 1565 .
The name was not commonly used for the whole mountain range until the late 19th century .
A competing and often more popular name was the " Allegheny Mountains " , " Alleghenies " , and even " Alleghania " .
In the early 19th century , Washington Irving proposed renaming the United States either Appalachia or Alleghania .
In U.S. dialects in the southern regions of the Appalachians , the word is pronounced , with the third syllable sounding like " latch " .
In northern parts of the mountain range , it is pronounced or ; the third syllable is like " lay " , and the fourth " chins " or " shins " .
There is often great debate between the residents of the regions as to which pronunciation is the more correct one .
Elsewhere , a commonly accepted pronunciation for the adjective Appalachian is , with the last two syllables " -ian " pronounced as in the word " Romanian " .
GEOGRAPHY REGIONS Section::::Geography .
Section::::Regions .
The whole system may be divided into three great sections :
* Northern : The northern section runs from the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador to the Hudson River .
It includes the Long Range Mountains and Annieopsquotch Mountains on the island of Newfoundland , Chic - Choc Mountains and Notre Dame Range in Quebec and New Brunswick , scattered elevations and small ranges elsewhere in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick , the Longfellow Mountains in Maine , the White Mountains in New Hampshire , the Green Mountains in Vermont , and The Berkshires in Massachusetts and Connecticut .
The Metacomet Ridge Mountains in Connecticut and south - central Massachusetts , although contained within the Appalachian province , is a younger system and not geologically associated with the Appalachians .
The Monteregian Hills , which cross the Green Mountains in Quebec , are also unassociated with the Appalachians .
* Central : The central section goes from the Hudson Valley to the New River ( Great Kanawha ) running through Virginia and West Virginia .
It comprises ( excluding various minor groups )
the Valley Ridges between the Allegheny Front of the Allegheny Plateau and the Great Appalachian Valley , the New York – New Jersey Highlands , the Taconic Mountains in New York , and a large portion of the Blue Ridge .
* Southern : The southern section runs from the New River onwards .
It consists of the prolongation of the Blue Ridge , which is divided into the Western Blue Ridge ( or Unaka ) Front and the Eastern Blue Ridge Front , the Ridge - and - Valley Appalachians , and the Cumberland Plateau .
The Adirondack Mountains in New York are sometimes considered part of the Appalachian chain but , geologically speaking , are a southern extension of the Laurentian Mountains of Canada .
In addition to the true folded mountains , known as the ridge and valley province , the area of dissected plateau to the north and west of the mountains is usually grouped with the Appalachians .
This includes the Catskill Mountains of southeastern New York , the Poconos in Pennsylvania , and the Allegheny Plateau of southwestern New York , western Pennsylvania , eastern Ohio and northern West Virginia .
This same plateau is known as the Cumberland Plateau in southern West Virginia , eastern Kentucky , western Virginia , eastern Tennessee , and northern Alabama .
The dissected plateau area , while not actually made up of geological mountains , is popularly called " mountains , " especially in eastern Kentucky and West Virginia , and while the ridges are not high , the terrain is extremely rugged .
In Ohio and New York , some of the plateau has been glaciated , which has rounded off the sharp ridges and filled the valleys to some extent .
The glaciated regions are usually referred to as hill country rather than mountains .
The Appalachian region is generally considered the geographical divide between the eastern seaboard of the United States and the Midwest region of the country .
The Eastern Continental Divide follows the Appalachian Mountains from Pennsylvania to Georgia .
The Appalachian Trail is a hiking trail that runs all the way from Mount Katahdin in Maine to Springer Mountain in Georgia , passing over or past a large part of the Appalachian system .
The International Appalachian Trail is an extension of this hiking trail into the Canadian portion of the Appalachian range in New Brunswick and Quebec .
CHIEF SUMMITS Section::::Chief summits .
The Appalachian belt includes , with the ranges enumerated above , the plateaus sloping southward to the Atlantic Ocean in New England , and south - eastward to the border of the coastal plain through the central and southern Atlantic states ; and on the north - west , the Allegheny and Cumberland plateaus declining toward the Great Lakes and the interior plains .
A remarkable feature of the belt is the longitudinal chain of broad valleys , including The Great Appalachian Valley , which in the southerly sections divides the mountain system into two unequal portions , but in the northernmost lies west of all the ranges possessing typical Appalachian features , and separates them from the Adirondack group .
The mountain system has no axis of dominating altitudes , but in every portion , the summits rise to rather uniform heights , and , especially in the central section , the various ridges and intermontane valleys have the same trend as the system itself .
None of the summits reaches the region of perpetual snow .
Mountains of the Long Range in Newfoundland reach heights of nearly .
In the Chic - Choc and Notre Dame mountain ranges in Quebec , the higher summits rise above in elevation .
Isolated peaks and small ranges in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick vary from .
In Maine several peaks exceed , including Mount Katahdin at .
In New Hampshire , many summits rise above , including Mount Washington in the White Mountains at , Adams at , Jefferson at , Monroe at , Madison at , Lafayette at , and Lincoln at .
In the Green Mountains the highest point , Mt. Mansfield , is in elevation ; others include Killington Peak at , Camel 's Hump at , Mt. Abraham at , and a number of other heights exceeding .
In Pennsylvania , there are over sixty summits that rise over ; the summits of Mount Davis and Blue Knob rise over .
In Maryland , Eagle Rock and Dans Mountain are conspicuous points reaching and respectively .
On the same side of the Great Valley , south of the Potomac , are the Pinnacle and Pidgeon Roost .
In West Virginia , more than 150 peaks rise above , including Spruce Knob , the highest point in the Allegheny Mountains .
A number of other points in the state rise above .
Snowshoe Mountain at Thorny Flat and Bald Knob are among the more notable peaks in West Virginia .
The Blue Ridge Mountains , rising in southern Pennsylvania and there known as South Mountain , attain elevations of about in that state .
South Mountain achieves its highest point just below the Mason - Dixon line in Maryland at Quirauk Mountain and then diminishes in height southward to the Potomac River .
Once in Virginia the Blue Ridge again reaches and higher .
In the Virginia Blue Ridge , the following are some of the highest peaks north of the Roanoke River : Stony Man , Hawksbill Mountain , Apple Orchard Mountain and Peaks of Otter .
South of the Roanoke River , along the Blue Ridge , are Virginia 's highest peaks including Whitetop Mountain and Mount Rogers , the highest point in the Commonwealth .
Chief summits in the southern section of the Blue Ridge are located along two main crests — the Western or Unaka Front along the Tennessee - North Carolina border and the Eastern Front in North Carolina — or one of several " cross ridges " between the two main crests .
Major subranges of the Eastern Front include the Black Mountains , Great Craggy Mountains , and Great Balsam Mountains , and its chief summits include Grandfather Mountain near the Tennessee - North Carolina border , Mount Mitchell in the Blacks , and Black Balsam Knob and Cold Mountain in the Great Balsams .
The Western Blue Ridge Front is subdivided into the Unaka Range , the Bald Mountains , the Great Smoky Mountains , and the Unicoi Mountains , and its major peaks include Roan Mountain in the Unakas , Big Bald and Max Patch in the Bald Mountains , Clingmans Dome , Mount Le Conte , and Mount Guyot in the Great Smokies , and Big Frog Mountain near the Tennessee - Georgia - North Carolina border .
Prominent summits in the cross ridges include Waterrock Knob ( ) in the Plott Balsams .
Across northern Georgia , numerous peaks exceed , including Brasstown Bald , the state 's highest , at and Rabun Bald .
DRAINAGE Section::::Drainage .
There are many geological issues concerning the rivers and streams of the Appalachians .
In spite of the existence of the Great Appalachian Valley , many of the main rivers are transverse to the mountain system axis .
The drainage divide of the Appalachians follows a tortuous course which crosses the mountainous belt just north of the New River in Virginia .
South of the New River , rivers head into the Blue Ridge , cross the higher Unakas , receive important tributaries from the Great Valley , and traversing the Cumberland Plateau in spreading gorges ( water gaps ) , escape by way of the Cumberland River and the Tennessee River rivers to the Ohio River and the Mississippi River , and thence to the Gulf of Mexico .
In the central section , north of the New River , the rivers , rising in or just beyond the Valley Ridges , flow through great gorges to the Great Valley , and then across the Blue Ridge to tidal estuaries penetrating the coastal plain via the Roanoke River , James River , Potomac River , and Susquehanna River .
In the northern section the height of land lies on the inland side of the mountainous belt , and thus the main lines of drainage run from north to south , exemplified by the Hudson River .
However , the valley through which the Hudson River flows was cut by the gigantic glaciers of the Ice Ages — the same glaciers that deposited their terminal moraines in southern New York and formed the east - west Long Island . GEOLOGY Section::::Geology .
A look at rocks exposed in today 's Appalachian mountains reveals elongated belts of folded and thrust faulted marine sedimentary rocks , volcanic rocks and slivers of ancient ocean floor , which provides strong evidence that these rocks were deformed during plate collision .
The birth of the Appalachian ranges , some 480 Ma , marks the first of several mountain - building plate collisions that culminated in the construction of the supercontinent Pangaea with the Appalachians near the center .
Because North America and Africa were connected , the Appalachians formed part of the same mountain chain as the Little Atlas in Morocco .
This mountain range , known as the Central Pangean Mountains , extended into Scotland , before the Mesozoic Era opening of the Iapetus Ocean , from the North America / Europe collision ( See Caledonian orogeny ) .
During the middle Ordovician Period ( about 496–440 Ma ) , a change in plate motions set the stage for the first Paleozoic mountain - building event ( Taconic orogeny ) in North America .
The once - quiet Appalachian passive margin changed to a very active plate boundary when a neighboring oceanic plate , the Iapetus , collided with and began sinking beneath the North American craton .
With the birth of this new subduction zone , the early Appalachians were born .
Along the continental margin , volcanoes grew , coincident with the initiation of subduction .
Thrust faulting uplifted and warped older sedimentary rock laid down on the passive margin .
As the mountains rose , erosion began to wear them down .
Streams carried rock debris downslope to be deposited in nearby lowlands .
The Taconic Orogeny was just the first of a series of mountain building plate collisions that contributed to the formation of the Appalachians , culminating in the collision of North America and Africa ( see Alleghanian orogeny ) .
By the end of the Mesozoic Era , the Appalachian Mountains had been eroded to an almost flat plain .
It was not until the region was uplifted during the Cenozoic Era that the distinctive topography of the present formed .
Uplift rejuvenated the streams , which rapidly responded by cutting downward into the ancient bedrock .
Some streams flowed along weak layers that define the folds and faults created many millions of years earlier .
Other streams downcut so rapidly that they cut right across the resistant folded rocks of the mountain core , carving canyons across rock layers and geologic structures .
MINERAL RESOURCES Section::::Mineral resources .
The Appalachian Mountains contain major deposits of anthracite coal as well as bituminous coal .
In the folded mountains the coal is in metamorphosed form as anthracite , represented by the Coal Region of northeastern Pennsylvania .
The bituminous coal fields of western Pennsylvania , western Maryland , southeastern Ohio , eastern Kentucky , southwestern Virginia , and West Virginia contain the sedimentary form of coal .
The mountain top removal method of coal mining , in which entire mountain tops are removed , is currently threatening vast areas and ecosystems of the Appalachian Mountain region .
The 1859 discovery of commercial quantities of petroleum in the Appalachian Mountains of western Pennsylvania started the modern United States petroleum industry .
Recent discoveries of commercial natural gas deposits in the Marcellus Shale formation and Utica Shale formations have once again focused oil industry attention on the Appalachian Basin .
Some plateaus of the Appalachian Mountains contain metallic minerals such as iron and zinc .
ECOLOGY FLORA Section::::Ecology .
Section::::Flora .
The floras of the Appalachians are diverse and vary primarily in response to geology , latitude , elevation and moisture availability .
Geobotanically , they constitute a floristic province of the North American Atlantic Region .
The Appalachians consist primarily of deciduous broad - leaf trees and evergreen needle - leaf conifers , but also contain the evergreen broad - leaf American holly ( ' ) , and the deciduous needle - leaf conifer , the tamarack , or eastern larch ( ' ) .
The dominant northern and high elevation conifer is the red spruce ( ' ) , which grows from near sea level to above above sea level ( asl ) in northern New England and southeastern Canada .
It also grows southward along the Appalachian crest to the highest elevations of the southern Appalachians , as in North Carolina and Tennessee .
In the central Appalachians it is usually confined above asl , except for a few cold valleys in which it reaches lower elevations .
In the southern Appalachians , it is restricted to higher elevations .
Another species is the black spruce ( ' ) , which extends farthest north of any conifer in North America , is found at high elevations in the northern Appalachians , and in bogs as far south as Pennsylvania .
The Appalachians are also home to two species of fir , the boreal balsam fir ( ' ) , and the southern high elevation endemic , Fraser fir ( ' ) .
Fraser fir is confined to the highest parts of the southern Appalachian Mountains , where along with red spruce it forms a fragile ecosystem known as the Southern Appalachian spruce - fir forest .
Fraser fir rarely occurs below , and becomes the dominant tree type at .
By contrast , balsam fir is found from near sea level to the tree line in the northern Appalachians , but ranges only as far south as Virginia and West Virginia in the central Appalachians , where it is usually confined above asl , except in cold valleys .
Curiously , it is associated with oaks in Virginia .
The balsam fir of Virginia and West Virginia is thought by some to be a natural hybrid between the more northern variety and Fraser fir .
While red spruce is common in both upland and bog habitats , balsam fir , as well as black spruce and tamarack , are more characteristic of the latter .
However balsam fir also does well in soils with a pH as high as 6 .
Eastern or Canada hemlock ( ' ) is another important evergreen needle - leaf conifer that grows along the Appalachian chain from north to south but is confined to lower elevations than red spruce and the firs .
It generally occupies richer and less acidic soils than the spruce and firs and is characteristic of deep , shaded and moist mountain valleys and coves .
It is , unfortunately , subject to the hemlock woolly adelgid ( ' ) , an introduced insect , that is rapidly extirpating it as a forest tree .
Less abundant , and restricted to the southern Appalachians , is Carolina hemlock ( ) .
Like Canada hemlock , this tree suffers severely from the hemlock woolly adelgid .
Several species of pines characteristic of the Appalachians are eastern white pine ( ' ) , Virginia pine ( ' ) , pitch pine ( ' ) , Table Mountain pine ( ' ) and shortleaf pine ( ' ) .
Red pine ( ' ) is a boreal species that forms a few high elevation outliers as far south as West Virginia .
All of these species except white pine tend to occupy sandy , rocky , poor soil sites , which are mostly acidic in character .
White pine , a large species valued for its timber , tends to do best in rich , moist soil , either acidic or alkaline in character .
Pitch pine is also at home in acidic , boggy soil , and Table Mountain pine may occasionally be found in this habitat as well .
Shortleaf pine is generally found in warmer habitats and at lower elevations than the other species .
All the species listed do best in open or lightly shaded habitats , although white pine also thrives in shady coves , valleys , and on floodplains .
The Appalachians are characterized by a wealth of large , beautiful deciduous broadleaf ( hardwood ) trees .
Their occurrences are best summarized and described in E. Lucy Braun 's 1950 classic , Deciduous Forests of Eastern North America ( Macmillan , New York ) .
The most diverse and richest forests are the mixed mesophytic or medium moisture types , which are largely confined to rich , moist montane soils of the southern and central Appalachians , particularly in the Cumberland and Allegheny Mountains , but also thrive in the southern Appalachian coves .
Characteristic canopy species are white basswood ( ' ) , yellow buckeye ( ' ) , sugar maple ( ' ) , American beech ( ' ) , tuliptree ( ' ) , white ash ( ' ) and yellow birch ( ' ) .
Other common trees are red maple ( ' ) , shagbark and bitternut hickories
( ' ) and black or sweet birch
( ' ) .
Small understory trees and shrubs include flowering dogwood ( ' ) , hophornbeam ( ' ) , witch - hazel ( ' ) and spicebush ( ' ) .
There are also hundreds of perennial and annual herbs , among them such herbal and medicinal plants as American ginseng
( ' ) , goldenseal ( ' ) , bloodroot ( ' ) and black cohosh ( ' ) .
The foregoing trees , shrubs , and herbs are also more widely distributed in less rich mesic forests that generally occupy coves , stream valleys and flood plains throughout the southern and central Appalachians at low and intermediate elevations .
In the northern Appalachians and at higher elevations of the central and southern Appalachians these diverse mesic forests give way to less diverse " northern hardwoods " with canopies dominated only by American beech , sugar maple , American basswood ( ) and yellow birch and with far fewer species of shrubs and herbs .
Dryer and rockier uplands and ridges are occupied by oak - chestnut type forests dominated by a variety of oaks ( ' spp . ) , hickories ( ' spp . )
and , in the past , by the American chestnut ( ' ) .
The American chestnut was virtually eliminated as a canopy species by the introduced fungal chestnut blight ( ' ) , but lives on as sapling - sized sprouts that originate from roots , which are not killed by the fungus .
In present - day forest canopies , chestnut has been largely replaced by oaks .
The oak forests of the southern and central Appalachians consist largely of black , northern red , white , chestnut and scarlet oaks ( and ) and hickories , such as the pignut ( ) in particular .
The richest forests , which grade into mesic types , usually in coves and on gentle slopes , have dominantly white and northern red oaks , while the driest sites are dominated by chestnut oak , or sometimes by scarlet or northern red oaks .
In the northern Appalachians the oaks , except for white and northern red , drop out , while the latter extends farthest north .
The oak forests generally lack the diverse small tree , shrub and herb layers of mesic forests .
Shrubs are generally ericaceous , and include the evergreen mountain laurel ( ' ) , various species of blueberries ( ' spp . ) , black huckleberry ( ' ) , a number of deciduous rhododendrons ( azaleas ) , and smaller heaths such as teaberry ( ' ) and trailing arbutus ( ' ) .
The evergreen great rhododendron ( ' ) is characteristic of moist stream valleys .
These occurrences are in line with the prevailing acidic character of most oak forest soils .
In contrast , the much rarer chinquapin oak ( ) demands alkaline soils and generally grows where limestone rock is near the surface .
Hence no ericaceous shrubs are associated with it .
The Appalachian floras also include a diverse assemblage of bryophytes ( mosses and liverworts ) , as well as fungi .
Some species are rare and/or endemic .
As with vascular plants , these tend to be closely related to the character of the soils and thermal environment in which they are found .
Eastern deciduous forests are subject to a number of serious insect and disease outbreaks .
Among the most conspicuous is that of the introduced gypsy moth ( ' ) , which infests primarily oaks , causing severe defoliation and tree mortality .
But it also has the benefit of eliminating weak individuals , and thus improving the genetic stock , as well as creating rich habitat of a type through accumulation of dead wood .
Because hardwoods sprout so readily , this moth is not as harmful as the hemlock woolly adelgid .
Perhaps more serious is the introduced beech bark disease complex , which includes both a scale insect ( ' ) and fungal components .
During the 19th and early 20th centuries , the Appalachian forests were subject to severe and destructive logging and land clearing , which resulted in the designation of the national forests and parks as well many state protected areas .
However , these and a variety of other destructive activities continue , albeit in diminished forms ; and thus far only a few ecologically based management practices have taken hold .
Appalachian bogs are boreal ecosystems , which occur in many places in the Appalachians , particularly the Allegheny and Blue Ridge subranges .
Though popularly called bogs , many of them are technically fens .
FAUNA Section::::Fauna .
Animals that characterize the Appalachian forests include five species of tree squirrels .
The most commonly seen is the low to moderate elevation eastern gray squirrel ( ' ) .
Occupying similar habitat is the slightly larger fox squirrel ( ' ) and the much smaller southern flying squirrel ( ' ) .
More characteristic of cooler northern and high elevation habitat is the red squirrel ( ' ) , whereas the Appalachian northern flying squirrel ( ) , which closely resembles the southern flying squirrel , is confined to northern hardwood and spruce - fir forests .
As familiar as squirrels are the eastern cottontail rabbit ( ' ) and the white - tailed deer ( ' ) .
The latter in particular has greatly increased in abundance as a result of the extirpation of the eastern wolf ( ' ) and the cougar .
This has led to the overgrazing and browsing of many plants of the Appalachian forests , as well as destruction of agricultural crops .
Other deer include the moose ( ' ) , found only in the north , and the elk ( ' ) , which , although once extirpated , is now making a comeback , through transplantation , in the southern and central Appalachians .
In Quebec , the Chic - Chocs host the only population of caribou ( ' ) south of the St. Lawrence River .
An additional species that is common in the north but extends its range southward at high elevations to Virginia and West Virginia is the varying of snowshoe hare ( ) .
However , these central Appalachian populations are scattered and very small .
Another species of great interest is the beaver ( ) , which is showing a great resurgence in numbers after its near extirpation for its pelt .
This resurgence is bringing about a drastic alteration in habitat through the construction of dams and other structures throughout the mountains .
Other common forest animals are the black bear ( ' ) , striped skunk ( ' ) , raccoon ( ' ) , woodchuck ( ' ) , bobcat ( ' ) , gray fox ( ' ) , red fox ( ' ) and in recent years , the coyote ( ' ) , another species favored by the advent of Europeans and the extirpation of eastern and red wolves .
European boars were introduced in the early 20th century .
Characteristic birds of the forest are wild turkey ( ' ) , ruffed grouse ( ' ) , mourning dove ( ' ) , common raven ( ' ) , wood duck ( ' ) , great horned owl ( ' ) , barred owl ( ' ) , screech owl ( ' ) , red - tailed hawk ( ' ) , red - shouldered hawk ( ' ) , and northern goshawk ( ) , as well as a great variety of " songbirds " ( Passeriformes ) , like the warblers in particular .
Of great importance are the many species of salamanders and , in particular , the lungless species ( Family ' ) that live in great abundance concealed by leaves and debris , on the forest floor .
Most frequently seen , however , is the eastern or red - spotted newt ( ' ) , whose terrestrial eft form is often encountered on the open , dry forest floor .
It has been estimated that salamanders represent the largest class of animal biomass in the Appalachian forests .
Frogs and toads are of lesser diversity and abundance , but the wood frog ( ' ) is , like the eft , commonly encountered on the dry forest floor , while a number of species of small frogs , such as spring peepers ( ' ) , enliven the forest with their calls .
Salamanders and other amphibians contribute greatly to nutrient cycling through their consumption of small life forms on the forest floor and in aquatic habitats .
Although reptiles are less abundant and diverse than amphibians , a number of snakes are conspicuous members of the fauna .
One of the largest is the non - venomous black rat snake ( ' ) , while the common garter snake ( ' ) is among the smallest but most abundant .
The American copperhead ( ' ) and the timber rattler ( ' ) are venomous pit vipers .
There are few lizards , but the broad - headed skink ( ' ) , at up to in length , and an excellent climber and swimmer , is one of the largest and most spectacular in appearance and action .
The most common turtle is the eastern box turtle ( ' ) , which is found in both upland and lowland forests in the central and southern Appalachians .
Prominent among aquatic species is the large common snapping turtle ( ) , which occurs throughout the Appalachians .
Appalachian streams are notable for their highly diverse freshwater fish life .
Among the most abundant and diverse are those of the minnow family ( family Cyprinidae ) , while species of the colorful darters ( spp . ) are also abundant .
A characteristic fish of shaded , cool Appalachian forest streams is the wild brook or speckled trout ( ) , which is much sought after as a game fish .
However , in past years such trout waters have been much degraded by increasing temperatures due to timber cutting , pollution from various sources and potentially , global warming .
