WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT
Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a 1988 American live - action / animated comedy film directed by Robert Zemeckis , produced by Frank Marshall and Robert Watts , and written by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman .
The film is based on Gary K. Wolf 's 1981 novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit ? .
The film stars Bob Hoskins , Christopher Lloyd , Charles Fleischer , Stubby Kaye , and Joanna Cassidy .
Combining live - action and animation , the film is set in Hollywood during the late 1940s , where cartoon characters and people co - exist .
The story follows Eddie Valiant , a private detective who must exonerate " Toon " ( i.e. cartoon character )
Roger Rabbit , who is accused of murdering a wealthy businessman .
Walt Disney Pictures purchased the film rights for Who Framed Roger Rabbits story in 1981 .
Price and Seaman wrote two drafts of the script before Disney brought in executive producer Steven Spielberg , and his production company , Amblin Entertainment .
Zemeckis was brought on to direct the film , and Canadian animator Richard Williams was hired to supervise the animation sequences .
Production was moved from Los Angeles to Elstree Studios in England to accommodate Williams and his group of animators .
While filming , the production budget began to rapidly expand and the shooting schedule ran longer than expected .
Disney released the film through its Touchstone Pictures division on June 22 , 1988 , to critical and commercial success , becoming a blockbuster .
The film brought a renewed interest in the Golden Age of American animation , spearheading modern American animation and the Disney Renaissance .
In 2016 , the film was selected for the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress .
PLOT Section::::Plot .
In 1947 Los Angeles , " toons " act in theatrical cartoon shorts as with live - action films ; they regularly interact with real people and animals and reside in Toontown , a fictional place where animated cartoon characters ( toons ) reside .
Private detective Eddie Valiant and his brother , Teddy , once worked closely with the toons on several famous cases , but after Teddy was killed by a toon , Eddie lapsed into alcoholism and vowed never to work for toons again .
R.K. Maroon , head of Maroon Cartoon Studios , is concerned about the recent poor performances of one of his biggest stars , Roger Rabbit .
Maroon hires Valiant to investigate rumors about Roger 's voluptuous toon wife Jessica being romantically involved with businessman and gadget inventor Marvin Acme , owner of both Acme Corporation and Toontown .
After watching Jessica perform at the underground Ink and Paint Club , Valiant secretly photographs her and Acme playing patty - cake in her dressing room , which he shows to Roger .
Maroon suggests to Roger that he should leave Jessica , but a drunken Roger refuses and flees .
The next morning , Acme is discovered dead at his factory by the Los Angeles Police Department with a safe dropped on his head , and evidence points to Roger being responsible .
While investigating , Valiant meets Judge Doom , Toontown 's superior court judge , who has created a substance capable of killing a toon : a toxic " dip " made of turpentine , acetone , and benzene .
Valiant runs into Roger 's toon co - star , Baby Herman , who believes Roger is innocent and that Acme 's missing will , which will give the toons ownership of Toontown , may be the key to his murder .
Valiant finds Roger , who begs him to help exonerate him , hiding in his office .
Valiant reluctantly hides Roger in a local bar , where his ex - girlfriend , Dolores , works .
Jessica approaches Valiant and says that Maroon forced her to pose for the photographs so he could blackmail Acme .
Doom and his toon weasel
henchmen discover Roger , but he and Valiant escape with Benny , an anthropomorphic taxicab .
They flee to a theater , where Valiant tells Roger that a toon killed Teddy when they were investigating a bank robbery by dropping a piano on his head .
As they leave with Dolores , Valiant sees a newsreel detailing the sale of Maroon Cartoons to Cloverleaf , a mysterious corporation that bought the city 's trolley network shortly before Acme 's murder .
Valiant goes to the studio to confront Maroon , leaving Roger to guard outside , but Jessica knocks Roger out and puts him in the trunk .
Maroon tells Valiant that he blackmailed Acme into selling his company so he could sell the studio , then tearfully admits he only did so out of fear for the safety of the toons and is killed before he can explain the consequences of the missing will .
Valiant spots Jessica fleeing the scene , and assuming she is the culprit , follows her into Toontown .
Jessica reveals that Doom killed Acme and Maroon and that Acme gave her his will for safekeeping , but she discovered that the will was blank .
She and Valiant are captured by Doom and the weasels .
At the Acme factory , Doom reveals his plot to destroy Toontown with a machine loaded with dip to build a freeway , the only way past Toontown since Cloverleaf ( which Doom owns ) has bought out Los Angeles ' Pacific Electric Railway .
Roger unsuccessfully attempts to save Jessica , and the couple is tied onto a hook in front of the machine 's hose .
Valiant performs a comedic vaudeville act , causing the weasels to die of laughter ; Valiant kicks their leader into the machine 's dip vat , killing him .
Valiant fights Doom , who is flattened by a steamroller , but survives , revealing him as a toon .
Doom reveals that he killed Teddy .
Valiant uses a toon mallet with a spring - loaded boxing glove and fires it at a switch that causes the machine to empty its dip onto Doom , dissolving him to death .
The empty machine crashes through the wall into Toontown , where it is destroyed by a train .
Toons run in to regard Doom 's remains , and Roger discovers that he inadvertently wrote his love letter for Jessica on Acme 's will , which was written in disappearing / reappearing ink .
Roger shocks Valiant with a joy buzzer , and Valiant gives him a kiss , having regained his sense of humor .
Valiant happily enters Toontown with Dolores , and Roger with Jessica , followed by the other toons .

Section::::Additional voices .
Who Framed Roger Rabbit was one of the final productions in which Mel Blanc voiced his Looney Tunes characters before his death the following year .
Blanc was unable to perform some of his gruffer character voices , so they were instead given to Joe Alaskey .
An archival recording of Clarence Nash , the original voice of Donald Duck , was used at the beginning of his scene .
CHARACTERS Section::::Characters .
The main characters of the film are Roger Rabbit , a cartoon rabbit , his cartoon - human wife Jessica Rabbit , and human detective Eddie Valiant and Judge Doom .
Other characters in the film include : Baby Herman is Roger 's major co - star in the animated shorts in which they appear .
He is Roger 's best friend .
Baby Herman 's " mother " , Mrs. Herman ( voiced by April Winchell ) , makes an appearance at the beginning of Who Framed Roger Rabbit and its spin - off short films , but she is only shown from the waist down .
Baby Herman and Roger Rabbit comprised an Abbott and Costello - like comedy team for the fictitious Maroon Cartoons studio in the 1940s .
A typical Roger / Baby Herman cartoon consists of Roger being given responsibility for Baby Herman 's well - being ; Herman immediately begins crawling through a number of dangerous situations from which Roger must rescue him .
In the process , Roger suffers extravagant injuries and humiliations reminiscent of those in classic Tex Avery cartoons , while Baby Herman remains unscathed .
For both book adaptations , Baby Herman was murdered , leaving behind a doppelganger for Eddie Valiant to help solve the crime .
In the film , Baby Herman 's role was downplayed .
In one scene , he tells Eddie that Roger did not murder Marvin Acme and tips off that Acme had a will that promised to leave Toontown to the Toons , which is the reason why Acme was killed .
Baby Herman later appears at the end of the film , expressing his annoyance that Acme did not leave his will where it could easily be found .
Despite his name and appearance , " Baby " Herman is actually a middle - aged , cigar - smoking Toon who looks like an infant .
While filming " in character " , he speaks baby talk in a typical baby boy 's voice provided by Winchell ; off - camera , he has a loud , gravelly voice provided by Lou Hirsch .
Animation director Richard Williams loved the character of " adult " Baby Herman so much that he personally animated all of the scenes of the character in the film .
When he loses his cigar and finds himself unable to reach it , he starts crying like a baby ( albeit with his voice still sounding like a middle - aged man ) .
Benny the Cab is a taxicab that services the Los Angeles area in the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit .
He is voiced in all appearances by Charles Fleischer .
In the original story , Who Censored Roger Rabbit ? , a different character named Bennie is an insect who deals in second - hand items at the junkyard .
The character was expanded for the movie , as an anthropomorphized colorful yellow Volkswagen Beetle - style taxi cab .
The Toon Patrol is a group of five anthropomorphic animated tailless weasels who serve as henchmen to Judge Doom in Who Framed Roger Rabbit .
They serve as the secondary antagonists of the film .
In the film , the Toon Patrol comprises the " police officers " of Toontown , but they behave less like law enforcers and more like gangsters and crooks .
Judge Doom hires them to capture Roger Rabbit for the murder of Marvin Acme .
The Toon Patrol drives around in a black Dodge Humpback paddy wagon labeled with the Los Angeles city seal like with cruisers of the Los Angeles Police Department .
The weasels enjoy laughing at the misery of others , including each other .
Like all the other Toons in the movie , they are invincible to physical body harm except for the dip .
However , prolonged laughter is also shown to be lethal to them .
Eddie Valiant jokes around in front of them during the climax of the movie , causing all but Smartass to " die " from laughing at him , after which their Toon souls rise to heaven in angel forms .
According to Judge Doom , they once had hyena cousins that died in the same manner .
While being designed , the weasels and their fondness of weapons were modeled after the weasels in the 1949 Disney cartoon
The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad .
The weasels make an appearance in the Roger Rabbit 's Car Toon Spin attraction located at Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland .
Dolores ( Joanna Cassidy ) is Eddie Valiant 's girlfriend who works as a waitress in a bar .
She is involved in helping Eddie solve the case against Judge Doom .
R.K. Maroon ( Alan Tilvern ) is the owner of Maroon Cartoons .
He paid Eddie $ 100 to photograph Jessica and Marvin Acme , which eventually led to Acme 's murder .
Maroon later admitted that he was trying to blackmail Acme into selling Toontown to Cloverleaf Industries so that he could sell his studio as well , since Cloverleaf wanted to buy both properties at once .
Before he could reveal who was behind the plot , he was shot and killed by Judge Doom .
Marvin Acme ( Stubby Kaye ) is the owner of Acme Products and Toontown .
He is known around Hollywood as " the gag king " for the prank items he makes his living selling .
Among his top sellers are Disappearing / Reappearing Ink and a hand buzzer .
In a blackmail scheme by R.K. Maroon , he has an " affair " with Toon Jessica Rabbit which Eddie Valiant ( who briefly meets Acme ) photographs .
Acme is murdered later that night by Judge Doom , who drops a safe on his head and frames Jessica 's husband , Roger .
Lt . Santino ( Richard LeParmentier ) is a lieutenant with the LAPD , and friend of Eddie .
He accompanies Eddie to the Acme factory , where Marvin Acme has been murdered and everyone suspects Roger .
Here they are introduced to Judge Doom who explains the ingredients of the Dip .
When Doom demonstrates the Dip on a defenceless Toon shoe , Santino turns away in distress , unable to watch the Toon die .
Santino is present with several officers when Eddie discovers that it was Doom who killed Acme along with Maroon and Teddy .
Theodore " Teddy " J. Valiant is the deceased brother of Eddie .
Teddy was killed by a piano dropped onto him by a Toon later revealed to be Judge Doom while investigating a robbery in Toontown .
Due to his brother 's death , Eddie , with whom Teddy had cracked many a case and helped Toons who were in trouble , vowed never to work for a Toon again and would n't for many years .
To honor his brother , Eddie left Teddy 's desk the way it was the day he died and refuses to allow anyone to sit at it .
Eddie avenged his brother 's death when he destroyed Doom with Doom 's Dip .
Angelo ( Richard Ridings ) is a client of Dolores 's bar .
Eddie is not particularly fond of Angelo , as he makes fun of Eddie for his detective work .
Eddie regards Angelo as the kind of guy who would sell someone out at the first opportunity , but Angelo helps Roger avoid Judge Doom 's search after Roger makes him laugh .
When asked by Doom if he has seen a rabbit , Angelo mocks him by gesturing to a patch of empty space and saying , " Say hello to the Judge , Harvey . " - a reference to the 1944 play of that name by Mary Coyle Chase .
Bongo ( voiced by Morgan Deare , Roger Rabbit 's Car Toon Spin voiced by Jeff Bergman ) is a cartoon gorilla bouncer of The Ink and Paint Club .
The password that Eddie uses to get in was " Walt sent me " and Bongo lets him in .
He also tosses Eddie out of the club when he catches Eddie spying on Jessica Rabbit and Marvin P. Acme in Jessica 's dressing room .
Lena Hyena is a Toon Hag that resembles Jessica Rabbit .
When Eddie was looking for Jessica Rabbit , he saw what appeared to be her in an apartment building .
When Eddie entered the room , he encountered Lena Hyena who developed a crush on Eddie and chased him around parts of Toon Town .
Eddie was able to get rid of her by tricking her into running into the wall of a building .
The Toon Bullets are a group of six bullets with personalities similar to those of characters in Western movies .
They were a present from Yosemite Sam , thanking Eddie for " springing him from the hoosegow . "
When Eddie Valiant decides to enter Toontown in pursuit of Judge Doom , he discards his pistol in favor of an oversized Toon revolver and loads the bullets into it .
He fires at Doom , but the bullets become confused as to where he went and turn in the wrong direction .
"
Dum - dums , " Eddie says sourly .
( This is a wordplay insofar as dum - dums are a type of bullet , specifically ones which are hollow - nosed or soft - nosed . )
PRODUCTION
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Production .
Section::::Development .
Walt Disney Productions purchased the film rights to Gary K. Wolf 's novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit ?
shortly after its publication in 1981 .
Ron W. Miller , then president of Disney , saw it as a perfect opportunity to produce a blockbuster .
Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were hired to write the script , penning two drafts .
Robert Zemeckis offered his services as director in 1982 , but Disney declined as his two previous films ( I Wanna Hold Your Hand and Used Cars ) had been box - office bombs .
Between 1981 and 1983 Disney developed test footage with Darrell Van Citters as animation director , Paul Reubens voicing Roger Rabbit , Peter Renaday as Eddie Valiant , and Russi Taylor as Jessica Rabbit .
The project was revamped in 1985 by Michael Eisner , the then - new CEO of Disney .
Amblin Entertainment , which consisted of Steven Spielberg , Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy , were approached to produce Who Framed Roger Rabbit alongside Disney .
The original budget was projected at $ 50 million , which Disney felt was too expensive .
Roger Rabbit was finally green - lit when the budget decreased to $ 30 million , which at the time still made it the most expensive animated film ever green - lit .
Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg argued that the hybrid of live action and animation would " save " Disney 's animation department .
Spielberg 's contract included an extensive amount of creative control and a large percentage of the box - office profits .
Disney kept all merchandising rights .
Spielberg convinced Warner Bros. , Fleischer Studios , King Features Syndicate , Felix the Cat Productions , Turner Entertainment , and Universal Pictures / Walter Lantz Productions to " lend " their characters to appear in the film with ( in some cases ) stipulations on how those characters were portrayed ; for example , Disney 's Donald Duck and Warner 's Daffy Duck appear as equally talented dueling pianists , and Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny also share a scene .
Apart from this agreement , Warner Bros. and the various other companies were not involved in the production of Roger Rabbit .
Additionally , the producers were unable to acquire the rights to use Popeye , Tom and Jerry , Little Lulu , Casper the Friendly Ghost , or the Terrytoons for appearances from their respective owners (
King Features , Turner , Western Publishing , Harvey Comics , and Viacom ) .
Terry Gilliam was offered the chance to direct , but he found the project too technically challenging .
( " Pure laziness on my part , " he later admitted , " I completely regret that decision . " )
Robert Zemeckis was hired to direct in 1985 , based on the success of Romancing the Stone and Back to the Future .
Disney executives were continuing to suggest Darrell Van Citters to direct the animated sequences , but Spielberg and Zemeckis decided against it .
Richard Williams was eventually hired to direct the animation .
Zemeckis wanted the film to imbue " Disney 's high quality of animation , Warner Bros. ' characterization , and Tex Avery humor " .
CASTING
Section::::Casting .
Harrison Ford was Spielberg 's original choice to play Eddie Valiant , but Ford 's price was too high .
Bill Murray was also considered for the part , but due to his idiosyncratic method of receiving offers for roles , Murray missed out on it .
Eddie Murphy reportedly turned down the role of Eddie , which he later came to regret .
Several other actors were also considered for the role of Eddie Valiant , including Chevy Chase , Robert Redford , Jack Nicholson , Sylvester Stallone , Wallace Shawn , Ed Harris , Charles Grodin , and Don Lane .
To facilitate Hoskins ' performance , Charles Fleischer dressed in a Roger bunny suit and " stood in " behind camera for most scenes .
Animation director Williams explained Roger Rabbit was a combination of " Tex Avery 's cashew nut - shaped head , the swatch of red hair ... like Droopy 's , Goofy 's overalls , Porky Pig 's bow tie , Mickey Mouse 's gloves , and Bugs Bunny - like cheeks and ears . "
Kathleen Turner provided the uncredited voice of Jessica Rabbit , Roger Rabbit 's Toon wife .
Christopher Lloyd was cast because he previously worked with Zemeckis and Spielberg on Back to the Future .
Lloyd compared his part as Doom to his previous role as the Klingon commander Kruge in , both being overly evil characters which he considered being " fun to play " .
Lloyd avoided blinking his eyes while on camera to perfectly portray the character .
Tim Curry originally auditioned for the role of Judge Doom , but after his audition , the producers found him too terrifying for the role .
Christopher Lee was also considered for the role , but turned it down .
Several other actors were also considered for the role of Judge Doom , including John Cleese , Roddy McDowall , Eddie Deezen , and Sting .
Fleischer also voiced Benny the Cab and two members of Doom 's weasel gang , Psycho and Greasy .
Lou Hirsch , who supplied the voice for Baby Herman , was the original choice for Benny the Cab , but was replaced by Fleischer .
WRITING Section::::Writing .
Price and Seaman were brought aboard to continue writing the script once Spielberg and Zemeckis were hired .
For inspiration , the two writers studied the work of Walt Disney and Warner Bros. Cartoons from the Golden Age of American animation , especially Tex Avery and Bob Clampett cartoons .
The Cloverleaf streetcar subplot was inspired by Chinatown .
Price and Seaman said that " the Red Car plot , suburb expansion , urban and political corruption really did happen , " Price stated .
"
In Los Angeles , during the 1940s , car and tire companies teamed up against the Pacific Electric Railway system and bought them out of business .
Where the freeway runs in Los Angeles is where the Red Car used to be . "
In Wolf 's novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit ? , the toons were comic - strip characters rather than movie stars .
During the writing process , Price and Seaman were unsure of whom to include as the villain in the plot .
They wrote scripts that had either Jessica Rabbit or Baby Herman as the villain , but they made their final decision with newly created character Judge Doom .
Doom was supposed to have an animated vulture sit on his shoulder , but this was deleted due to the technical challenges this posed .
Doom would also have a suitcase of 12 small animated kangaroos that act as a jury , by having their joeys pop out of their pouches , each with letters , when put together would spell YOU ARE GUILTY .
This was also cut for budget and technical reasons .
Doom 's five - man weasel gang ( Stupid , Smart Ass , Greasy , Wheezy , and Psycho ) satirizes the Seven Dwarfs ( Doc , Grumpy , Happy , Sleepy , Bashful , Sneezy , and Dopey ) , who appeared in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ( 1937 ) .
Originally , seven weasels were to mimic the dwarf 's complement , but eventually , two of them , Slimey and Slezey , were written out of the script .
Further references included The " Ink and Paint Club " resembling the Harlem Cotton Club , while Zemeckis compared Judge Doom 's invention of " the dip " to eliminate all the toons as Hitler 's Final Solution .
Doom was originally the hunter who killed Bambi 's mother .
Benny the Cab was first conceived to be a Volkswagen Beetle before being changed to a taxicab .
Ideas originally conceived for the story also included a sequence set at Marvin Acme 's funeral , whose attendees included Eddie , Foghorn Leghorn , Mickey Mouse , Minnie Mouse , Tom and Jerry , Heckle and Jeckle , Chip n ' Dale , Mighty Mouse , Superman , Popeye , Olive Oyl , Bluto , Clarabelle Cow , and the Seven Dwarfs in cameo appearances .
However , the scene was cut for pacing reasons and never made it past the storyboard stage .
Before finally agreeing on Who Framed Roger Rabbit as the film 's title , working titles included Murder in Toontown , Toons , Dead Toons Do n't Pay Bills , The Toontown Trial , Trouble in Toontown , and Eddie Goes to Toontown .
FILMING
Section::::Filming .
Animation director Richard Williams admitted he was " openly disdainful of the Disney bureaucracy " and refused to work in Los Angeles .
To accommodate him and his animators , production was moved to Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire , England .
Disney and Spielberg also told Williams that in return for doing Roger Rabbit , they would help distribute his uncompleted film The Thief and the Cobbler .
Supervising animators included Dale Baer , James Baxter , David Bowers , Andreas Deja , Chris Jenkins , Phil Nibbelink , Nik Ranieri , and Simon Wells .
The animation production , headed by associate producer Don Hahn , was split between Richard Williams ' London studio and a specialized unit in Los Angeles , set up by Walt Disney Feature Animation and supervised by Dale Baer .
The production budget continued to escalate , while the shooting schedule lapsed longer than expected .
When the budget reached $ 40 million , Disney president Michael Eisner seriously considered shutting down production , but Jeffrey Katzenberg talked him out of it .
Despite the budget escalating to over $ 50 million , Disney moved forward on production because they were enthusiastic to work with Spielberg .
VistaVision cameras installed with motion - control technology were used for the photography of the live - action scenes which would be composited with animation .
Rubber mannequins of Roger Rabbit , Baby Herman , and the weasels would portray the animated characters during rehearsals to teach the actors where to look when acting with " open air and imaginative cartoon characters " .
Many of the live - action props held by cartoon characters were shot on set with either robotic arms holding the props or the props were manipulated by strings , similar to a marionette .
The actor who played the voice of Roger , Charles Fleischer , insisted on wearing a Roger Rabbit costume while on the set , to get into character .
Filming began on November 2 , 1986 , and lasted for seven and a half months at Elstree Studios , with an additional month in Los Angeles and at Industrial Light & Magic ( ILM ) for blue screen effects of Toontown .
The entrance of Desilu Studios served as the fictional Maroon Cartoon Studio lot .
ANIMATION AND POST - PRODUCTION
Section::::Animation and post - production .
Post - production lasted for 14 months .
Because the film was made before computer animation and digital compositing were widely used , all the animation was done using cels and optical compositing .
First , the animators and lay - out artists were given black - and - white printouts of the live - action scenes ( known as " photo stats " ) , and they placed their animation paper on top of them .
The artists then drew the animated characters in relationship to the live - action footage .
Due to Zemeckis ' dynamic camera moves , the animators had to confront the challenge of ensuring the characters were not " slipping and slipping all over the place .
"
After rough animation was complete , it was run through the normal process of traditional animation until the cels were shot on the rostrum camera with no background .
The animated footage was then sent to ILM for compositing , where technicians animated three lighting layers ( shadows , highlights , and tone mattes ) separately , to make the cartoon characters look three - dimensional and give the illusion of the characters being affected by the lighting on set .
Finally , the lighting effects were optically composited on to the cartoon characters , who were , in turn , composited into the live - action footage .
One of the most difficult effects in the film was Jessica 's dress in the nightclub scene , because it had flashing sequins , an effect accomplished by filtering light through a plastic bag scratched with steel wool .
MUSIC Section::::Music .
Regular Zemeckis collaborator Alan Silvestri composed the film score , performed by the London Symphony Orchestra ( LSO ) under the direction of Silvestri .
Zemeckis joked that " the British [ musicians ] could not keep up with Silvestri 's jazz tempo " .
The performances of the music themes written for Jessica Rabbit were entirely improvised by the LSO .
The work of American composer Carl Stalling heavily influenced Silvestri 's work on Who Framed Roger Rabbit .
The film 's soundtrack was originally released by Buena Vista Records on June 22 , 1988 , and reissued by Walt Disney Records on CD on April 16 , 2002 .
On January 23 , 2018 Intrada Records released a 3-CD set with complete score , alternates , remastered version of original 1988 album plus music from 3 Roger Rabbit short films , composed & conducted by Bruce Broughton and James Horner .
RELEASE
Section::::Release .
Michael Eisner , then CEO , and Roy E. Disney , Vice Chairman of the Walt Disney Company , felt Who Framed Roger Rabbit was too risqué with sexual references .
Eisner and Zemeckis disagreed over various elements of the film , but since Zemeckis had final cut privilege , he refused to make alterations .
Roy E. Disney , head of Feature Animation along with studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg , felt it was appropriate to release the film under their Touchstone Pictures banner instead of the traditional Walt Disney Pictures banner .
Who Framed Roger Rabbit opened in the United States on June 22 , 1988 , grossing $ 11,226,239 in 1,045 theaters during its opening weekend , ranking first place in the domestic box office .
The film went on to gross $ 156,452,370 in North America and $ 173,351,588 internationally , coming to a worldwide total of $ 329,803,958 .
At the time of release , Roger Rabbit was the 20th - highest - grossing film of all time .
The film was also the second - highest - grossing film of 1988 , behind only Rain Man .
Zemeckis has revealed a three - dimensional reissue could be possible .

The film also inspired a short - lived comic - book and video - game spin - offs , including two PC games , the Japanese version of The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle ( which features Roger instead of Bugs ) , a 1989 game released on the Nintendo Entertainment System , and a 1991 game released on the Game Boy .
In December 2016 , the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being " culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant " .
CONTROVERSY Section::::Controversy .
With the film 's LaserDisc release , Variety first reported in March 1994 that observers uncovered several scenes of antics from the animators that supposedly featured brief nudity of the Jessica Rabbit character .
While undetectable when played at the usual rate of 24 film frames per second , the Laserdisc player allowed the viewer to advance frame - by - frame to uncover these visuals .
Whether or not they were actually intended to depict the nudity of the character remains unknown .
Many retailers said that within minutes of the Laserdisc debut , their entire inventory was sold out .
The run was fueled by media reports about the controversy , including stories on CNN and various newspapers .
Another frequently debated scene includes one in which Baby Herman extends his middle finger as he passes under a woman 's dress and re - emerges with drool on his lip .
Also , controversy exists over the scene where Daffy Duck and Donald Duck are playing a piano duel , and during his trademark ranting gibberish , it is claimed that Donald calls Daffy a " goddamn stupid nigger " ; however , this is a misinterpretation , with the line from the script being " doggone stubborn little—. " LEGAL ISSUE
Section::::Legal issue .
Gary K. Wolf , author of the novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit ? , filed a lawsuit in 2001 against the Walt Disney Company .
Wolf claimed he was owed royalties based on the value of " gross receipts " and merchandising sales .
In 2002 , the trial court in the case ruled that these only referred to actual cash receipts Disney collected and denied Wolf 's claim .
In its January 2004 ruling , the California Court of Appeal disagreed , finding that expert testimony introduced by Wolf regarding the customary use of " gross receipts " in the entertainment business could support a broader reading of the term .
The ruling vacated the trial court 's order in favor of Disney and remanded the case for further proceedings .
In a March 2005 hearing , Wolf estimated he was owed $ 7 million .
Disney 's attorneys not only disputed the claim , but also said Wolf actually owed Disney $ 500,000–$1 million because of an accounting error discovered in preparing for the lawsuit .
Wolf won the decision in 2005 , receiving between $ 180,000 and $ 400,000 in damages .
PROPOSED SEQUEL
Section::::Proposed sequel .
Spielberg discussed a sequel in 1989 with J. J. Abrams as writer and Zemeckis as producer .
Abrams 's outline was eventually abandoned .
Nat Mauldin was hired to write a prequel titled Roger Rabbit : The Toon Platoon , set in 1941 .
Similar to the previous film , Toon Platoon featured many cameo appearances by characters from the Golden Age of American animation .
It began with Roger Rabbit 's early years , living on a farm in the midwestern United States .
With human Ritchie Davenport , Roger travels west to seek his mother , in the process meeting Jessica Krupnick ( his future wife ) , a struggling Hollywood actress .
While Roger and Ritchie are enlisting in the Army , Jessica is kidnapped and forced to make pro - Nazi Germany broadcasts .
Roger and Ritchie must save her by going into Nazi - occupied Europe accompanied by several other Toons in their Army platoon .
After their triumph , Roger and Ritchie are given a Hollywood Boulevard parade , and Roger is finally reunited with his mother , and father :
Bugs Bunny .
Mauldin later retitled his script Who Discovered Roger Rabbit .
Spielberg left the project when deciding he could not satirize Nazis after directing Schindler 's List .
Eisner commissioned a rewrite in 1997 with Sherri Stoner and Deanna Oliver .
Although they kept Roger 's search for his mother , Stoner and Oliver replaced the WWII subplot with Roger 's inadvertent rise to stardom on Broadway and Hollywood .
Disney was impressed and Alan Menken was hired to write five songs for the film and offered his services as executive producer .
One of the songs , " This Only Happens in the Movies " , was recorded in 2008 on the debut album of Broadway actress Kerry Butler .
Eric Goldberg was set to be the new animation director , and began to redesign Roger 's new character appearance .
Spielberg became busy establishing DreamWorks , while Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy decided to remain as producers .
Test footage for Who
Discovered Roger Rabbit was shot sometime in 1998 at the Disney animation unit in Lake Buena Vista , Florida ; the results were a mix of CGI , traditional animation , and live - action that did not please Disney .
A second test had the Toons completely converted to CGI ; but this was dropped as the film 's projected budget would escalate past $ 100 million .
Eisner felt it was best to cancel the film .
In March 2003 , producer Don Hahn was doubtful about a sequel being made , arguing that public tastes had changed since the 1990s with the rise of computer animation .
" There was something very special about that time when animation was not as much in the forefront as it is now . "
In December 2007 , Marshall stated that he was still " open " to the idea , and in April 2009 , Zemeckis revealed he was still interested .
According to a 2009 MTV News story , Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were writing a new script for the project , and the animated characters would be in traditional two - dimensional , while the rest would be in motion capture .
However , in 2010 , Zemeckis said that the sequel would remain hand - drawn animated and live - action sequences will be filmed , just like in the original film , but the lighting effects on the cartoon characters and some of the props that the Toons handle will be done digitally .
Also in 2010 , Don Hahn , who was the film 's original associate producer , confirmed the sequel 's development in an interview with Empire .
He stated , " Yeah , I could n't possibly comment .
I deny completely , but
yeah ...
if you 're a fan , pretty soon you 're going to be very , very , very happy . "
In 2010 , Bob Hoskins stated he was interested in the project , reprising his role as Eddie Valiant .
However , he retired from acting in 2012 after being diagnosed with Parkinson 's disease a year earlier , and died from complications in 2014 .
Marshall has confirmed that the film is a prequel , similar to earlier drafts , and that the writing was almost complete .
During an interview at the premiere of Flight , Zemeckis stated that the sequel was still possible , despite Hoskins ' absence , and the script for the sequel was sent to Disney for approval from studio executives .
In February 2013 , Gary K. Wolf , writer of the original novel , said Erik Von Wodtke
and he were working on a development proposal for an animated Disney buddy comedy starring Mickey Mouse and Roger Rabbit called The Stooge , based on the 1952 film of the same name .
The proposed film is set to a prequel , taking place five years before Who Framed Roger Rabbit and part of the story is about how Roger met Jessica , his future wife .
Wolf has stated the film is currently wending its way through Disney .
In November 2016 , while promoting his latest film , Allied , in England , Zemeckis stated that the sequel " moves the story of Roger and Jessica Rabbit into the next few years of period film , moving on from film noir to the world of the 1950s " .
He also stated that the sequel would feature a " digital Bob Hoskins " , as Eddie Valiant would return in " ghost form " .
While the director went on to state that the script is " terrific " and the film would still use hand - drawn animation , Zemeckis thinks that the chances of Disney green - lighting the sequel are " slim " .
As he explained more in detail , " The current corporate Disney culture [ the current studio management of The Walt Disney Company ] has no interest in Roger , and they certainly do n't like Jessica at all . "
ROGER RABBIT DANCE Section::::Roger Rabbit dance .
Roger Rabbit was the inspiration for a popular dance move in America in the early 1990s , called " the Roger Rabbit " due to the floppy movements of the character in the film .
