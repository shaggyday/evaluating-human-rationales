REMOTE PLAY Remote Play is a feature of Sony video game consoles that allows the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 to transmit its video and audio output to a PlayStation Portable or PlayStation Vita .
Similar functionality is provided on Nintendo 's Wii U console , using the Off - TV Play function .
This feature essentially allows compatible home console games to be played on the handheld .
In 2014 , it was expanded to include the use of PlayStation TV , Xperia smartphones and tablets ( Z2 and later ) , and PlayStation Now .
In 2016 , it was expanded to Microsoft Windows PCs and macOS .
While seldom implemented on PS3 , Remote Play is a mandatory feature on all PS4 games , except for games that utilize peripherals such as PlayStation Move .
CONCEPT
Section::::Concept .
Sony defined Remote Play as follows :
" Remote Play allows a PSP system to connect wirelessly to a PS3 system and transfers some functionality of the PS3 to the PSP system .
With remote play , a PSP system may access files that are located on the PS3 , as well as , play certain software titles ...
" Sony later amended this definition to apply between the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita as well .
The premise of Off - TV Play on the Wii U is similar in concept , in how the video game console does all of the processing , but sends the image and sound straight to the Wii U GamePad 's screen instead of a television screen .
Similarly , in the case of Remote Play , the PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 4 do all of the processing , but transmit the image and sound to the PlayStation Portable or PlayStation Vita screens and speakers .
While typically in reference to Sony consoles and handhelds , it has been used in different ways as well .
In April 2010 , a firmware update was released for the PS3 that allowed Remote Play between it and the Sony VAIO brand desktops and laptops and Sony Xperia brand smartphones and tablets as well .
BACKGROUND PS3 TO PSP Section::::Background .
Section::::PS3 to PSP .
Interactivity between Sony 's home video game consoles and handheld video game console is traced back as far as 2006 , prior to the PlayStation 3 's launch , when journalists noticed a PlayStation Portable icon , with the title " Remote Play " , on pre - release versions of their PS3 .
The functionality was officially revealed just prior to the PS3 's launch in October 2006 , at Sony 's " Gamer 's Day " event , where Sony demonstrated the ability to transfer the PS3 's output to a PSP instead of a television , through showing downloaded PlayStation games and movie films being transmitted to a PSP 's screen and speakers .
Sony announced that all original PlayStation games would support the feature , but they had to be digital , not disc - based , media from the PS3 's internal harddrive .
This later changed by the end of 2007 , when a firmware update made it so any original PlayStation game was compatible with Remote Play , even disc - based ones .
Despite Sony 's early emphasis on Remote Play and original PlayStation game support , it was used very sparingly between the PS3 and PSP , with very few PS3 titles allowing for its use .
The feature was even removed from several titles before their final release , most notably Gran Turismo HD and Formula One Championship Edition .
Most titles were small PlayStation Network - only titles .
The late 2007 PS3 title Lair was notable for being one of the few original , physical Blu - Ray disc releases
work between the PS3 and PSP .
PS3 TO PS VITA
Section::::PS3 to PS Vita .
In late 2011 , just prior to the launch of the PlayStation Vita , video game website Eurogamer published a rumor stating that a firmware update for the PS3 would provide Remote Play compatibility for all PS3 games when using Remote Play between a PS3 and Vita .
The premise seemed plausible , with websites reporting that Sony had shown working demonstrations of the concept prior to the rumor at the Tokyo Game Show , showing LittleBigPlanet 2 and Killzone 3 supporting the feature .
Despite this , the rumor was declared false by Sony , who said that the feature had to be implemented on the software side by developers on an individual basis , not on a hardware level .
PS3 to Vita Remote Play went on to be rarely implemented as well .
It retained any games supported by PS3 to PSP Remote Play support , including all original PlayStation games , but was again rarely used by actual PS3 games .
Only a few games supported it , namely HD Remasters such as The Ico & Shadow of the Colossus Collection and the God of War Collection .
President of Sony 's Worldwide Studios for
Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. Shuhei Yoshida summarized the issues with PS3 to Vita Remote Play :
" The single biggest issue , why there are not many PlayStation 3 games that support Remote Play , was that it was optional â€“ the system did n't do much .
The game has to set aside some memory or CPU to be able to do that , and usually , memory is the most precious resource that [ development ] teams fight amongst each other for .
So when it comes down to the priorities , these are features that are very easy to drop . "
Despite this , unofficial hacks to the PS3 firmware have been reported to unlock the Remote Play feature in a number of PS3 games with varying degrees of success .
Games such as Battlefield 3 and BioShock Infinite have been shown to technically be feasible , though still impossible to do without unofficially hacking the PS3 's firmware .
PS4 TO PS VITA Section::::PS4 to PS Vita .
In June 2013 , Sony announced that all PlayStation 4 games would be compatible with Remote Play with the PS Vita , with the exception of games which conceptually would not work , such as ones that heavily revolve around PlayStation Eye use .
Otherwise , contrary to PS3 to PS Vita Remote Play , PS4 to PS Vita Remote Play is designed on a hardware level , meaning that all games are automatically compatible , and it is only up to developers to make sure the controls adapt well to being played on a Vita instead of a DualShock 4 .
This iteration of Remote Play was developed by Gaikai , who also developed PlayStation Now .
Remote Play on the updated PlayStation Vita 2000 was shown at Tokyo Game Show in 2013 .
OTHER VARIANTS
Section::::Other variants .
PS4 firmware update 1.70 introduced full remote play functionality for the PlayStation TV , allowing users to play PS4 games in a separate room or house , on a television set with a PS TV device remotely connected to the PS4 .
Remote Play with the PS4 is available for Sony Xperia smartphones and tablet computers starting with the Z3 line , and requires a DualShock 4 in order to play games .
The service was made available on 28 October 2014 , and was expanded to Sony 's older Z2 series a month later .
With the release of PS4 system software 3.50 on 6 April 2016 , Remote Play was made available on Windows PCs and macOS .
A DualShock 4 controller is required to use it , and must be connected through a USB cable or wirelessly via a separate accessory .
1080p streaming is available when using a PS4 Pro model .
Cloud gaming and Remote Play are some of several Gaikai - powered streaming services announced for the PlayStation 4 through its PlayStation Now service .
Cloud gaming differs from Remote Play in that Remote Play allows games on home devices to operate remotely over a wireless network , while cloud gaming refers to a game that resides on a distant server rather than on a user 's device .
PS3 SOFTWARE COMPATIBILITY Section::::PS3 Software compatibility .
In 2007 , Sony made all original PlayStation games , when played on a PlayStation 3 , compatible with Remote Play on the PSP .
Additionally , Sony has announced that all PlayStation 4 games will be playable on the PlayStation Vita .
Beyond these two scenarios , Remote Play was a feature that was sparingly implemented in games .
