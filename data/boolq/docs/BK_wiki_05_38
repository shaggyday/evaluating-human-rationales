CAREER
Section::::Career .
While still in high school , Cassidy signed a contract with Mike Curb 's division of Warner Bros. Records and began recording music .
His debut studio album Shaun Cassidy was initially released in Europe and Australia in 1976 , and he scored a couple of hit singles in several countries , leading to an American release of that album in 1977 .
The multi - platinum album netted him a number - one U.S. single with " Da Doo Ron Ron " and a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best New Artist .
The Eric Carmen - penned " That 's Rock ' n ' Roll " ( which had already been a hit in Australia and Europe ) was the follow - up single and peaked at No . 3 .
His popularity continued with the concurrent arrival of his television series , The Hardy Boys / Nancy Drew Mysteries , which also starred Parker Stevenson .
Cassidy 's next album
Born Late peaked at No . 6 on the US Top 200 Albums chart and netted the hit " Hey Deanie " ( # 7 ) , also written by Carmen .
His label ran the same formula as before by releasing a remake of a previous hit as the second single ; this time with The Lovin' Spoonful 's " Do You Believe in Magic ? " .
It became a moderate hit for Cassidy , peaking at No . 31 .
Cassidy had released two successful albums , but by the release of his third album , 1978 's Under Wraps , his teen - star appeal had begun to fade .
The album just managed to crack the US top 40 , peaking at No . 33 , and it produced a minor hit in the song " Our Night " ( US No . 80 ) .
Cassidy 's 1979 album Room Service was also unsuccessful and it failed to appear on the US Top 200 Album chart .
Cassidy tried a different musical approach for his next release , 1980 's Wasp .
The album was more rock / pop - oriented and produced by Todd Rundgren with the group Utopia as the backing band .
It featured songs written by Rundgren , and cover versions including David Bowie 's " Rebel , Rebel " and
The Who 's "
So Sad About Us " among others .
The album , however , was unsuccessful and became Cassidy 's second album not to chart on the Billboard Album Chart .
Cassidy was eager to star in a role starring as Rogers Meyers in the ABC Friday Night Movie on April 13 , 1979 called Like Normal People .
" A Shaun Cassidy Special " aired on NBC television ; Saturday , September 26 , 1981 , which features Cassidy in concert with comedic vignettes of the singer 's life on the road .
Special guest stars are Loni Anderson with a special appearance by Jack Albertson .
Cassidy accepted a three - month part on General Hospital as Dusty Walker a musical drifter .
Cassidy concentrated on stage acting for most of the 1980s and early 1990s .
He appeared on Broadway and West End productions such as Mass Appeal and Bus Stop , as well as the American premiere of Pass / Fail at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles .
Cassidy won a Dramalogue award for his work in Mark Sheriden 's Diary of a Hunger Strike at the L.A.T.C. , and his final stage appearance was opposite his half - brother David in the Broadway production of Blood Brothers ( which successfully ran for over a year on Broadway ) .
It was during this production that Cassidy wrote his first television pilot , American Gothic , opening the door to a long - term contract with Universal Television .
From the late 1990s , Cassidy created , wrote , and produced numerous shows for network and cable including American Gothic , Roar ( starring Heath Ledger ) , Cover Me , Invasion , Ruby & the Rockits and Emerald City .
He is currently working as a consulting producer for the new series " New Amsterdam " ( starring Ryan Eggold ) and has written at least one script for the series .
