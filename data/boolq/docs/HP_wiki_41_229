DODGE DART ( PF )
The Dodge Dart is a transverse front - engine , front - wheel drive , four - door compact sedan manufactured and marketed by FCA US LLC , a subsidiary of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles .
The automobile made its debut at the 2012 North American International Auto Show in Detroit , Michigan .

Resurrecting a nameplate used by Dodge for model years 1960 - 1976 for a succession of full - size , mid - size and finally compact models , the Dart ( PF ) was the brand 's first compact sedan since 2005 , when the Neon was discontinued .
HISTORY Section::::History .
A mini MPV concept car was designed and developed by Chrysler and revealed in 2006 as the Dodge Hornet .
This was Dodge 's first attempt at building a car this small and the car was expected to be released in 2010 .
The concept was dropped because of the 2009 financial crisis and the restructuring of the Chrysler Group .
After Chrysler 's merger with Fiat in late 2010 , the small Dodge Hornet concept took on a new form to share a Fiat platform .
In December 2011 , the automaker announced the new small sedan would be called the Dodge Dart .
The Dart was scheduled for U.S. dealership sales beginning in late June 2012 .
The Aero model began production in the third quarter of 2012 .
The GT began production in the second quarter of 2013 .
On March 4 , 2014 , at the Geneva Motor Show , Sergio Marchionne commented on possible production of a hatchback model for the North American market , saying " our North American consumers will be gradually offered alternatives for same or close to expense " and that potential buyers might account for either Fiat 500X , or Jeep Renegade .
