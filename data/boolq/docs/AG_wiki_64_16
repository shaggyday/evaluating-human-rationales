CARRYING CAPACITY
The carrying capacity of a biological species in an environment is the maximum population size of the species that the environment can sustain indefinitely , given the food , habitat , water , and other necessities available in the environment .
In population biology , carrying capacity is defined as the environment 's maximal load , which is different from the concept of population equilibrium .
Its effect on population dynamics may be approximated in a logistic model , although this simplification ignores the possibility of overshoot which real systems may exhibit .
Carrying capacity was originally used to determine the number of animals that could graze on a segment of land without destroying it .
Later , the idea was expanded to more complex populations , like humans .
For the human population , more complex variables such as sanitation and medical care are sometimes considered as part of the necessary establishment .
As population density increases , birth rate often increases and death rate typically decreases .
The difference between the birth rate and the death rate is the " natural increase " .
The carrying capacity could support a positive natural increase or could require a negative natural increase .
Thus , the carrying capacity is the number of individuals an environment can support without significant negative impacts to the given organism and its environment .
Below carrying capacity , populations typically increase , while above , they typically decrease .
A factor that keeps population size at equilibrium is known as a regulating factor .
Population size decreases above carrying capacity due to a range of factors depending on the species concerned , but can include insufficient space , food supply , or sunlight .
The carrying capacity of an environment may vary for different species and may change over time due to a variety of factors including : food availability , water supply , environmental conditions and living space .
The origins of the term " carrying capacity " are uncertain , with researchers variously stating that it was used " in the context of international shipping " or that it was first used during 19th - century laboratory experiments with micro - organisms .
A recent review finds the first use of the term in an 1845 report by the US Secretary of State to the US Senate .
HUMANS Section::::Humans .
Several estimates of the carrying capacity have been made with a wide range of population numbers .
A 2001 UN report said that two - thirds of the estimates fall in the range of 4 billion to 16 billion with unspecified standard errors , with a median of about 10 billion .
More recent estimates are much lower , particularly if non - renewable resource depletion and increased consumption are considered .
Changes in habitat quality or human behavior at any time might increase or reduce carrying capacity .
In the view of Paul and Anne Ehrlich , " for earth as a whole ( including those parts of it we call Australia and the United States ) , human beings are far above carrying capacity today . "
The application of the concept of carrying capacity for the human population has been criticized for not successfully capturing the multi - layered processes between humans and the environment , which have a nature of fluidity and non - equilibrium , and for sometimes being employed in a blame - the - victim framework .
Supporters of the concept argue that the idea of a limited carrying capacity is just as valid applied to humans as when applied to any other species .
Animal population size , living standards , and resource depletion vary , but the concept of carrying capacity still applies .
The number of people is not the only factor in the carrying capacity of Earth .
Waste and over - consumption , especially by wealthy and near - wealthy people and nations , are also putting significant strain on the environment together with human overpopulation .
Population and consumption together appear to be at the core of many human problems .
Some of these issues have been studied by computer simulation models such as World3 .
When scientists talk of global change today , they are usually referring to human - caused changes in the environment of sufficient magnitude eventually to reduce the carrying capacity of much of Earth ( as opposed to local or regional areas ) to support organisms , especially Homo sapiens .
FACTORS
THAT GOVERN CARRYING CAPACITY Section::::Factors that govern carrying capacity .
Some aspects of a system 's carrying capacity may involve matters such as available supplies of food , water , raw materials , and/or other similar resources .
In addition , there are other factors that govern carrying capacity which may be less instinctive or less intuitive in nature , such as ever - increasing and/or ever - accumulating levels of wastes , damage , and/or eradication of essential components of any complex functioning system .
Eradication of , for example , large or critical portions of any complex system ( envision a space vehicle , for instance , or an airplane , or an automobile , or computer code , or the body components of a living vertebrate ) can interrupt essential processes and dynamics in ways that induce systems failures or unexpected collapse .
( As an example of these latter factors , the " carrying capacity " of a complex system such an airplane is more than a matter of available food , or water , or available seating , but also reflects total weight carried and presumes that its passengers do not damage , destroy , or eradicate parts , doors , windows , wings , engine parts , fuel , and oil , and so forth . )
Thus , on a global scale , food and similar resources may affect planetary carrying capacity to some extent so long as Earth 's human passengers do not dismantle , eradicate , or otherwise destroy critical biospheric life - support capacities for essential processes of self - maintenance , self - perpetuation , and self - repair .
Thus , carrying capacity interpretations that focus solely on resource limitations alone ( such as food ) may neglect wider functional factors .
If the humans neither gain nor lose weight in the long - term , the calculation is fairly accurate .
If the quantity of food is invariably equal to the " Y " amount , carrying capacity has been reached .
Humans , with the need to enhance their reproductive success ( see Richard Dawkins ' The Selfish Gene ) , understand that food supply can vary and also that other factors in the environment can alter humans ' need for food .
A house , for example , might mean that one does not need to eat as much to stay warm as one otherwise would .
Over time , monetary transactions have replaced barter and local production , and consequently modified local human carrying capacity .
However , purchases also impact regions thousands of miles away .
For example , carbon dioxide from an automobile travels to the upper atmosphere .
This led Paul R. Ehrlich to develop the I = PAT equation .
where : An important model related to carrying capacity ( K ) , is the logistic , growth curve .
The logistic growth curve depicts a more realistic version of how population growth rate , available resources , and the carrying capacity are inter - connected .
As illustrated in the logistic growth curve model , when the population size is small and there are many resources available , population over - time increases
and so does the growth rate .
However , as population size nears the carrying capacity and resources become limited , the growth rate decreases and population starts to level out at K.
This model is based on the assumption that carrying capacity does not change .
One thing to keep in mind , however , is that carrying capacity of a population can increase or decrease and there are various factors that affect it .
For instance , an increase in the population growth can lead to over - exploitation of necessary natural resources and therefore decrease the overall carrying capacity of that environment .
Technology can play a role in the dynamics of carrying capacity and while this can sometimes be positive , in other cases its influence can be problematic .
For example , it has been suggested that in the past that the Neolithic revolution increased the carrying capacity of the world relative to humans through the invention of agriculture .
In a similar way , viewed from the perspective of foods , the use of fossil fuels has been alleged to artificially increase the carrying capacity of the world by the use of stored sunlight , even though that food production does not guarantee the capacity of the Earth 's climatic and biospheric life - support systems to withstand the damage and wastes arising from such fossil fuels .
However , such interpretations presume the continued and uninterrupted functioning of all other critical components of the global system .
It has also been suggested that other technological advances that have increased the carrying capacity of the world relative to humans are : polders , fertilizer , composting , greenhouses , land reclamation , and fish farming .
In an adverse way , however , many technologies enable economic entities and individual humans to inflict far more damage and eradication , far more quickly and efficiently on a wider - scale than ever .
Examples include machine guns , chainsaws , earth - movers , and the capacity of industrialized fishing fleets to capture and harvest targeted fish species faster than the fish themselves can reproduce are examples of such problematic outcomes of technology .
Agricultural capability on Earth expanded in the last quarter of the 20th century .
But now there are many projections of a continuation of the decline in world agricultural capability ( and hence carrying capacity ) which began in the 1990s .
Most conspicuously , China 's food production is forecast to decline by 37 % by the last half of the 21st century , placing a strain on the entire carrying capacity of the world , as China 's population could expand to about 1.5 billion people by the year 2050 .
This reduction in China 's agricultural capability ( as in other world regions ) is largely due to the world water crisis and especially due to mining groundwater beyond sustainable yield , which has been happening in China since the mid-20th century .
Lester Brown of the Earth Policy Institute , has said : " It would take 1.5 Earths to sustain our present level of consumption .
Environmentally , the world is in an overshoot mode . "
ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT Section::::Ecological footprint .
One way to estimate human demand compared to ecosystem 's carrying capacity is " ecological footprint " accounting .
Rather than speculating about future possibilities and limitations imposed by carrying capacity constraints , Ecological Footprint accounting provides empirical , non - speculative assessments of the past .
It compares historic regeneration rates , biocapacity , against historical human demand , ecological footprint , in the same year .
One result shows that humanity 's demand footprint in 1999 exceeded the planet 's bio - capacity by > 20 % .
However , this measurement does not take into account the depletion of the actual fossil fuels , " which would result in a carbon Footprint many hundreds of times higher than the current calculation . "
There is also concern of the ability of countries around to globe to decrease and maintain their ecological footprints .
Holden and Linnerud , scholars working to provide a better framework that adequately judge sustainability development and maintenance in policy making , have generated a diagram that measures the global position of different countries around the world , which shows a linear relation between GDP PPP and ecological foot print in 2007 .
Possible answers to the question of where we are as individual countries attempting to reach sustainability and development methods to reduce ecological foot print .
According to the Figure 1 diagram , the United States had the largest ecological foot print per capita along with Norway , Sweden , and Austria , in comparison to Cuba , Bangladesh , and Korea .
