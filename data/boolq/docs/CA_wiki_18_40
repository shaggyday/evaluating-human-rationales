TOUR CHAMPIONSHIP
The Tour Championship ( stylized as the TOUR Championship ) is a golf tournament that is part of the PGA Tour .
It has historically been one of the final events of the PGA Tour season ; prior to 2007 , its field consisted exclusively of the top 30 money leaders of the past PGA Tour season .
Since 2007 , it has been the final event of the four - tournament FedEx Cup playoff , with eligibility determined by FedEx Cup points accumulated throughout the season .
While originally followed by the PGA Tour Fall Series ( for those competing for qualifying exemptions in the following season ) , a re - alignment of the PGA Tour 's season schedule in 2013 made the Tour Championship the final event of the season .
From 1987 to 1996 , several courses hosted the event .
Beginning in 1997 , the event alternated between Champions Golf Club in Houston and East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta ; since 2004 , East Lake has been the event 's permanent home .
FORMAT :
1987–2006
Section::::Format : 1987–2006 .
From its debut in 1987 through 2006 , the top 30 money winners on the PGA Tour after the penultimate event qualified for the event .
It took place in early November , the week after the comparable event in Europe , the Volvo Masters , which allowed players who are members of both the PGA Tour and the European Tour to play in both end of season events .
After the Tour Championship , the money list for the season was finalized .
There were , and still are , a number of additional events between the Tour Championship and Christmas which are recognized by the PGA Tour , but prize money won in them is unofficial .
Also , because this tournament 's field is not as large as other golf tournaments , there is no 36-hole cut ; all players who start the event are credited with making the cut and receive some prize money .
FORMAT : 2007–2018
Section::::Format : 2007–2018 .
In 2007 , the Tour Championship moved from November to mid - September , where it ends a four - tournament " Chase for the FedEx Cup " .
As in past years , 30 players qualify for the event , but the basis for qualification is no longer prize money .
Instead , FedEx Cup points accumulated during the regular PGA Tour season and then during the three preceding playoff events determine the participants .
Beginning in 2009 , the assignment and awarding of points assures that any of the top five FedEx Cup point leaders entering The Tour Championship who wins , will also win the FedEx Cup .
It still remains possible , however , for one player to win the Tour Championship and another player to win the FedEx Cup .
In 2007 , Tiger Woods won both the 2007 Tour Championship and the inaugural FedEx Cup .
In 2008 , The Tour Championship was won by Camilo Villegas , while Vijay Singh won the FedEx Cup .
In 2009 , Phil Mickelson won The Tour Championship , while Tiger Woods won the FedEx Cup .
In 2018 , Tiger Woods won the 2018 Tour Championship , while the FedEx Cup was won by Justin Rose .
2007 was also the inaugural year for the Tour 's Fall Series , which determined the rest of the top 125 players eligible for the following year 's FedEx Cup , which made the event no longer the final tournament of the season .
However , starting in 2013 , the Tour Championship was the end of the PGA Tour season ; seasons will now begin in October of the previous calendar year .
Since 2007 , those who qualified for the Tour Championship earned a Masters Tournament invitation .
Hole 18 at East Lake Golf Club is a par 3 , which has been criticized as lacking drama for fans .
The PGA Tour announced in 2016 that it would be reversing the nines at East Lake for the Tour Championship so that play would finish on a more exciting par 5 hole .
FORMAT :
2019
Section::::Format : 2019 .
Beginning in 2019 , the tournament will adopt a new format so that its winner will also be the FedEx Cup champion .
Rather than FedEx Cup points being reset for each qualifying player based on seeding , the tournament will begin with the # 1 overall seed starting at 10 under par .
The second seed will start at −8 , the third seed at −7 , and so on down to the fifth seed at −5 .
Seeds 6–10 will begin at −4 ; seeds 11–15 will begin at −3 ; and so on , down to seeds 26–30 who will start at even par .
