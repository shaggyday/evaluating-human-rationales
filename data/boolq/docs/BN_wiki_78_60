EARLY LIFE
Section::::Early life .
Dwyane Wade was born on the South Side of Chicago , Illinois , to JoLinda and Dwyane Wade Sr , whose name 's unusual spelling was decided by his own mother .
In 1977 , JoLinda , at the age of 18 , already had two children .
Wade has described his upbringing in Chicago as being very difficult .
Wade stated that " [ his ] mom was on drugs and [ his ] family was in the gang environment , so it was a rough childhood .
" At a very young age , Wade already witnessed police raids and found dead bodies several times in a nearby garbage can .
When he was only 4 months old , his parents separated – and would later divorce .
JoLinda was given custody of the two children , and she moved to her mother 's house with them .
The family struggled financially , and it was around that time when JoLinda started dealing drugs .
His mom was addicted to several substances including cigarettes , alcohol , heroin , and cocaine .
JoLinda would get high with friends at her home , even in the presence of her children .
In an interview with ESPN , Wade said " I 've seen the needles laying around the house .
I 've seen my mother shoot up before .
I 've seen a lot of things my mother did n't even know I 'd seen as a kid .
"
At the age of 6 , he recalls police – with guns drawn – raiding his home as they searched for his mother .
When Wade turned 8 years old , his older sister , Tragil , tricked him – by telling him they were going to the movies – into living with his father , a former Army sergeant , and stepmother in a nearby neighborhood .
Wade would still occasionally visit his mom .
A year later , his father moved the family to Robbins , Illinois .
After moving to Robbins , Wade did not see his mother for two years .
During this time , JoLinda was able to access a free supply of drugs by volunteering to be a tester – i.e. , someone who tests street drugs for impurities before the dealers try to sell them .
JoLinda was hospitalized and nearly died after she mistakenly injected herself with LSD .
In 1994 , JoLinda was arrested for possession of crack cocaine with intent to sell and locked up in Cook County Jail .
Wade , at the age of 10 , reunited with his mom by talking with her at Cook County Jail through a glass panel over a telephone .
JoLinda served 23 months in prison for her crimes , but while serving her second sentence in 1997 , she failed to report to prison while on work release .
Wade turned to sports , especially basketball and football , to avoid the temptations of participating in drug and gang - related activities .
Wade 's mom and dad would often take him to the park to play basketball .
He cites one of his older sisters , Tragil , as the individual most responsible for his childhood upbringing and for steering him in the proper direction .
As a child growing up in the Chicago area , Wade idolized Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan , and has said he patterns his game after him .
Wade attended Harold L. Richards High School in Oak Lawn .
Wade quickly found success as a wide receiver on the football team , but he needed to work extremely hard to earn playing time on the varsity basketball team during his junior year .
While he did not acquire much playing time during his second year , his stepbrother , Demetris McDaniel , was the star of the team .
Wade grew four inches in the summer before his junior year and saw an increase in playing time , averaging 20.7 points and 7.6 rebounds per game .
The following year , Wade averaged 27.0 points and 11.0 rebounds per game while leading his team to a 24–5 record .
It advanced to the title game of the Class AA Eisenhower Sectional .
During this season he set school records for points ( 676 ) and steals ( 106 ) in a season .
Wade has stated that his high school coach , Jack Fitzgerald , was one of the most positive influences in his life during this time .
Wade was recruited by only three college basketball teams ( Marquette University , Illinois State , and DePaul University ) due to academic problems .
During most of Wade 's time at Marquette , his mother was either eluding the law or serving time in jail for selling crack cocaine .
On October 14 , 2001 , JoLinda declared that she would change her life and get clean while attending a service at a Chicago church .
Wade , then a sophomore at Marquette , went home for Christmas to be with his mom , who he believed was clean and sober for the first time in his life .
However , JoLinda admitted to him that she was actually going back to prison .
Wade told ESPN , " I was hurt because I felt like I was just getting my mom back , and now she had to leave again . "
On January 2 , 2002 , his mother went back to prison to serve her 14-month sentence .
She says she has been clean since 2003 .
COLLEGE CAREER

On February 3 , 2007 , almost four years after Wade played in his final collegiate game , Marquette retired his jersey at halftime of a game against Providence .
Although Marquette requires student - athletes to graduate prior to receiving jersey retirement honors , the University made a special exception for Wade based on his accomplishments since leaving Marquette .

CHICAGO BULLS AND CLEVELAND CAVALIERS ( 2016–2018 ) Section::::Chicago Bulls and Cleveland Cavaliers ( 2016–2018 ) .
In July 2016 , Wade joined his hometown team , the Chicago Bulls , on a two - year deal worth approximately $ 47 million .
The Heat had a two - year , $ 40 million offer on the table for him , which Wade felt was unacceptable .
The relationship ended on bad terms with Wade , team president Pat Riley and the Heat squabbling over his contract .
Wade balked at the Heat 's initial offer as he was seeking more money and another year in a potential deal .
The Heat did not increase its initial offer to Wade , leading to Wade looking at alternative options .
Wade teamed - up with Jimmy Butler and Rajon Rondo in Chicago , with the trio being coined the " Three Alphas " .
In January 2017 , the trio were all fined for criticizing their young teammates ' effort , and in March 2017 , Wade sustained a fractured elbow .
Wade returned in time for the playoffs , but the Bulls were defeated 4–2 by the Boston Celtics in the first round despite going up 2–0 in the series .
The chemistry of the team , which was one of the biggest question marks for the Bulls all season , was strong over the first two games , but dwindled over the final four games after Rondo missed all four with an injury .
On September 24 , 2017 , three months after trading Butler and waiving Rondo , the Bulls reached an agreement on a buyout with Wade .
Three days later , Wade signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers .
Wade took a chance at teaming up with LeBron James once again , but the union took a turn for the worse almost immediately , with Wade balking at coach Tyronn Lue 's plan to bring him off the bench .
Wade started for the Cavaliers in the first three games of season but struggled mightily , shooting 7-for-25 from the field .
After a blowout loss to the Orlando Magic in the third game , Wade volunteered to demote himself to a bench role for the betterment of the team .
Wade eventually took to the bench role and became the leader of the second unit .

Cleveland wanted to " do right " by Wade , and as such , Wade was traded back to the Miami Heat in exchange for a protected 2024 second - round draft pick .
At the funeral of Wade 's long - time agent Henry Thomas in January 2018 , Wade mended relations with Heat president Pat Riley ; less than two weeks later , Wade found himself back in Miami .
Wade fully believed for many months that he would eventually return to the Heat , though he figured it would happen in a free - agent deal in the summer of 2018 .
On February 9 , in his return game for the Heat , Wade was introduced with a standing ovation from the crowd and came off the bench to score three points on 1-of-6 shooting with two assists , one rebound , a key late block , and four turnovers in 22 minutes of play in a 91–85 win over the Milwaukee Bucks .

He passed Larry Bird for 10th on the NBA 's career postseason scoring list .
The Heat lost the series in five games .

Watching Wade operate on the left block is literally like watching old footage of MJ ( Michael Jordan ) " , comments Thorpe .
