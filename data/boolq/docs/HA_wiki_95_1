LIST OF MAJOR LEAGUE
BASEBALL FRANCHISE POSTSEASON STREAKS
This is a list of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) franchise postseason and World Series streaks .
The list includes only the modern World Series between the American League ( AL ) and the National League ( NL ) , not the various 19th - century championship series .
The most successful postseason team in MLB history is the New York Yankees , who have achieved three of the four instances of a franchise winning more than two World Series championships in a row ( one streak each of durations 3 , 4 , and 5 seasons ) and five of the six instances of a franchise winning the league pennant ( i.e. , an appearance in the World Series ) more than three times in a row ( three streaks of 4 seasons and two streaks of 5 seasons ) .
The only other franchises to achieve these milestones are the Oakland Athletics , who won three consecutive championships from 1972 to 1974 , and the New York Giants , who won four consecutive pennants from 1921 to 1924 .
The Yankees also achieved a remarkable run of appearing in 15 of the 18 World Series from 1947 to 1964 .
Beginning in 1969 , MLB split into four divisions , and the winners of each competed in the League Championship Series , with the winners advancing to the World Series .
When a multi - tier playoff system was implemented in 1995 , the LCS remained the series that determined the pennant - winner .
The longest streak of consecutive LCS appearances belongs to the Atlanta Braves with 8 in a row from 1991 to 1999 ( not counting 1994 , when there were no playoffs ) , while the second - longest belongs to the Oakland Athletics with 5 in a row from 1971 to 1975 .
Further expansion of the postseason began in 1995 , with eight teams entering the playoffs each year ( further expanded to ten teams in 2012 ) .
In this era , the Braves entered the postseason 14 consecutive years from 1991 to 2005 ( again not counting 1994 ) , while the Yankees had a streak of 13 appearances from 1995 to 2007 .
However , all other postseason appearance streaks of 5 years or more predate the expanded - postseason era and are mentioned above , except for 5-year runs by the Cleveland Indians ( 1995–1999 ) , the Philadelphia Phillies ( 2007–2011 ) , the St. Louis Cardinals ( 2011–2015 ) , and an ongoing 6-year run by the Los Angeles Dodgers ( 2013–2018 ) .
