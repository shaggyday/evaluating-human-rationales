Of the 14 that have been used , 10 are currently used in the rota .
All the courses on the rota are links courses .
Prestwick Golf Club hosted the first championship in 1860 and remained the sole venue until 1873 , when the Old Course at St Andrews hosted the event .
Prestwick hosted a further 12 championships , the last in 1925 .
Musselburgh Links became the third course to host the championship in 1874 .
The three courses rotated the hosting of the championship until 1892 when Muirfield hosted the event .
The Honourable Company of Edinburgh golfers built their own course at Muirfield and Musselburgh was removed from the rota as a result .

Royal Liverpool Golf Club hosted the event for the first time in 1897 .
Royal Cinque Ports Golf Club became the next course to host the event in 1909 .
The course hosted a further championship in 1920 , but further attempts to host the Championship in 1938 and 1949 were thwarted by bad weather and the course was dropped from the rota .
Royal Troon , Royal Lytham & St Annes and Carnoustie held the Open Championship for the first time in 1923 , 1926 and 1931 respectively .
The following year Prince 's Golf Club hosted the event for the only time .
The course was requisitioned by the military during the Second World War and was extensively damaged .
Royal Birkdale was chosen as the host course in 1940 , however , due to the Second World War the event did not go ahead .
It was not until 1954 that Royal Birkdale hosted the Open .
The Old Course at St Andrews has hosted the most championships with 29 in total , most recently with the 2015 Open Championship .
