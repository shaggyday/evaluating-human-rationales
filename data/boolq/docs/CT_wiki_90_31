DEBADGING
The term debadging refers to the process of removing the manufacturer 's emblems from a vehicle .
Common emblems to be removed include the manufacturer 's logo as well as the emblems designating the model of the vehicle .
Often debadging is done to complement the smoothed - out bodywork of a modified car , or to disguise a lower - specification model .
Some people consider , when driving high - end luxury cars , to not " flaunt " the fact their car is any different from any other model and remove the badge .
It is a common request for purchasers of high - end models of cars like BMW , Mercedes , Lexus , etc .
to have the emblems removed .
Many automotive enthusiasts also believe that debadging a vehicle makes it easier to clean .
This is because manufacturer badges are notorious for trapping wax , which is difficult to remove from small crevices .
Also , sleepers sometimes are debadged to disguise any subtle evidence of a high performance vehicle .
Another common reason for debadging is to rid the car of its commercial advertising .
Drivers are not being paid to advertise the brand so some decide to remove this commercial aspect of the vehicle .
While most modern vehicle emblems are attached with adhesive and can be easily removed , some emblems require varying degrees of bodywork to fill in voids and mounting holes left behind .
Debadging can also refer to the process of removing the car manufacturer 's logo from the front grille .
The result is a car widely considered to appeal more to car enthusiasts .
The grill is often replaced by a plain grille , or a grille from another make and model of car altogether or one showing the more subtle logo of an aftermarket manufacturer such as ABT , Irmscher or Kamei .
This is a common customising technique on leadsleds and kustoms , which dates back to the 1940s .
For example , a Vauxhall Astra could have a grille swapped in from a Saab or a Jaguar E - type and be shaved of all trim .
