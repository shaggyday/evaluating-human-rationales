BATBOY A batboy or batgirl in sports is an individual who carries the baseball bats around to a baseball team .
A batboy may also lay out the equipment and mud the baseballs to be used in the game .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Mascots and batboys had both been part of baseball since the 1880s .
Perhaps the most famous mascot / batboy was Eddie Bennett , who was supposedly hired as a mascot by the Chicago White Sox at the urging of Happy Felsch in 1919 , a tale Eddie told often but no White Sox player ever corroborated .
After the 1919 World Series scandal , he was hired by the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1920 .
When the Dodgers lost the 1920 World Series to the Cleveland Indians , some suggested the four straight losses on the road were due to leaving Bennett behind .
He then served for almost 12 years as mascot / batboy for the New York Yankees .
UNIFORMS Section::::Uniforms .
Batboys typically wear the same uniform design as their associated team .
They will also usually wear a batting helmet to protect them from flying balls or bats .
During any given major league game , both the home and visiting team batboys will be drawn from the city where the game is taking place ( batboys typically do not travel on the road with their team , unless they are relatives of a player ) .
Home batboys often have regular jobs with a team , and thus may wear their first names on their uniforms ; visiting teams , on the other hand , usually do not know who will be serving as their batboys on the road , and thus will send uniforms of various sizes to accommodate batboys of varying heights and weights .
A batboy may be provided his own number , but will usually wear 00 or ' BB ' in its place .
If a batboy uniform does not have a first name on it , it will usually have the term ' BAT BOY ' or no name at all .
