GAMEPLAY
Section::::Gameplay .
Naruto :
Ultimate Ninja Storm retains many of the gameplay elements from earlier installments of the Ultimate Ninja series .
However , Ultimate Ninja Storm allows players to fight in three - dimensional environments , as opposed to the two - dimensional planes in previous games .
One of the new features introduced to the series in Ultimate Ninja Storm is " Awakening Mode " , a transformation that can be activated when a player loses a certain amount of health during a match .
The health requirement for each character differs based on how powerful the transformation is .
Once activated , the character gains new abilities , speed , and stronger attacks .
A few of the characters in the game gain entirely new movesets after transforming .
With the d - pad , players can use preset items during a match that either damage the opponent or provide various status effects like increasing attack power , or lowering the opponent 's defense .
Players are also able to customize their character 's jutsu and select two support characters to use in a match .
Returning to the game from previous installments is " jutsu clash " mode , which is initiated if both players activate their special attack at the same time .
During this mode , both players have to press the corresponding button as fast as possible in order to knock away their opponent .
Each character has an " ultimate jutsu " .
If it hits , both players either input button commands , mash a certain button , or spin the analogue stick the fastest during the time limit .
If the attacking player wins , the ultimate will hit , typically taking away around a third to a full bar of the opponent 's health .
If the defending player wins , they will escape without major damage .
Each character also has an " ultimate impact " , where if the player holds down the melee button , the character controlled will charge up a very powerful strike .
If it hits , it zooms in on the opponent 's face taking a heavy blow in a short , cinematic close - up .
The game includes 25 playable characters , each of which can also be used as a support character during battle .
Ten additional support - only characters are available as free downloadable content released over the five - month period that followed the game 's release .
Additional downloadable content include alternative costumes , and new missions .
The story mode loosely covers the events of the anime up to episode 135 .
Players are able to explore the Hidden Leaf Village between missions , which acts as a central hub for the story mode , and access more missions .
