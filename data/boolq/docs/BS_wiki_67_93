JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE
The Jeep Grand Cherokee is a range of mid - size SUVs produced by the American manufacturer Jeep .
While some other SUVs were manufactured with body - on - frame construction , the Jeep Grand Cherokee has always used a unibody chassis .
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Development .
The Grand Cherokee 's origins date back to 1983 when American Motors Corporation ( AMC ) was designing a successor to the smaller Jeep Cherokee ( XJ ) .
Three outside ( non - AMC ) designers — Larry Shinoda , Alain Clenet , and Giorgetto Giugiaro — were also under contract with AMC to create and build a clay model of the Cherokee XJ replacement , then known as the " XJC " project .
However , the basic design for the Cherokee 's replacement was well under way by AMC 's in - house designers and the 1989 Jeep Concept 1 show car foretold the basic design .
As AMC began development of the next Jeep in 1985 , management created a business process that is now known as product lifecycle management ( PLM ) .
According to François Castaing , Vice President for Product Engineering and Development , the smallest U.S. automaker was looking for a way to speed up its product development process to compete better against its larger competitors .
The XJC 's development was aided by computer - aided design ( CAD ) software systems making the engineers more productive .
Meanwhile , new communication systems allowed potential conflicts to be resolved faster , thus reducing costly engineering changes , because all drawings and documents were in a central database .
The system was so effective that after Chrysler purchased AMC in 1987 , it expanded the system throughout its enterprise , thus connecting everyone involved in designing and building products .
The Grand Cherokee thus became the first Chrysler - badged Jeep product .
Development work for the new Jeep model continued and Chrysler 's employees ( after the 1987 buyout of AMC ) were eager for a late-1980s release date ; however , CEO Lee Iacocca was pushing for redesigned Chrysler minivans , thus delaying the Grand Cherokee 's release until late-1992 as an Explorer competitor .
Unlike the Explorer , the Grand Cherokee utilized monocoque ( unibody ) construction , whereas the Explorer was a derivative of the Ranger pickup with a separate body - on - frame .
The Grand Cherokee debuted in grand fashion at the 1992 North American International Auto Show in Detroit , Michigan .
The vehicle that was driven was a Poppy Red Clear Coat 1993 Grand Cherokee ZJ Laredo with a quartz cloth interior and high - back bucket seats .
Then Chrysler president Robert Lutz drove Detroit mayor , Coleman Young , from the Jefferson North Assembly Plant on North Jefferson Avenue via a police escort to Cobo Hall , up the steps of Cobo Hall and through a plate glass window to show off the new vehicle .
Sales of the 1993 model year Grand Cherokee began in April 1992 .
Production of the Grand Cherokee started shortly afterward in the purpose - built Jefferson North Assembly in Detroit , Michigan .
European Grand Cherokees are manufactured in Austria by Magna Steyr .
The Grand Cherokee " played a significant part in reviving Chrysler 's fortunes by moving it into the then nascent market for high - margin sports utility vehicles . "
Upon its introduction , it was the first USA - manufactured automobile using HFC-134a refrigerant in place of HCFC-12 for the HVAC system .
FIRST GENERATION ( ZJ ; 1993–1998 )
Section::::First generation ( ZJ ; 1993–1998 ) .
The original Grand Cherokee was launched in 1992 as a 1993 model year vehicle in the luxury SUV segment .
The " ZJ " models , manufactured from 1992 to 1998 , originally came in three trim levels :
base ( also known as SE ) , Laredo , and Limited , subsequent trims were added , included Orvis ( MY 95–98 ) , TSI ( MY97–98 ) .
The base model included features such as full instrumentation , cloth interior , and a standard five - speed manual transmission , while gaining the moniker " SE " name for the 1994 model year .
Power windows and locks were not standard equipment on the base trim .
The minimal price tag differential resulted in low consumer demand , and as a result , the low - line model was eventually discontinued .
Additional standard features included a driver - side air bag and four - wheel anti - lock braking system ( ABS ) .
The Laredo was the mid - scale model with standard features that included power windows , power door locks , cruise control , and a leather wrapped steering wheel .
Exterior features included medium - grey plastic paneling on the lower body and five - spoke alloy wheels .
The Limited was the premium model , featuring body color lower body paneling , and gold exterior accents .
The Limited also boasted standard features such as leather seating , heated mirrors , front power seats , a keyless entry system , wood grain interior appliqué , lace style alloy wheels , a driver information center with compass , digitized climate control , and electrochromic rearview mirror , and Jensen brand stereo with multi - band equalizer .
By 1996 the option list grew to include heated seats .
Standard was the 4.0 , with the 5.2 V8 ( and 5.9 in 1998 ) being optional .
As with other models .
Package groups with the various trim levels included : fog lamps , skid plates , as well as convenience , lighting , luxury , power , security , and trailer towing packages .
When it was first introduced in April 1992 as an early 1993 model year vehicle , the Grand Cherokee only had one powertrain choice : the 4.0 L AMC - derived straight - six engine that made 190 horsepower .
This became the " volume " engine for the Grand Cherokee .
Transmission choices included a four - speed automatic transmission ( early production ZJs used the AW4 – the A500SE ( later 42RE ) replaced the AW4 during the latter half of the 1993 model year ) or an Aisin AX15 manual transmission .
Low demand for the manual transmission resulted in its discontinuation after 1994 , but European - market ZJs retained it when coupled to the diesel engine ( which was unavailable in North America ) .
The drive train choices included rear - wheel drive or four - wheel - drive .
In 1995 , the engine dropped 5 horsepower to 185 due to new EPA regulations imposed on the 1996 model year .
In 1997 , for the 1998 model year , a variant of the top - level Grand Cherokee Limited , the " 5.9 Limited " was introduced .
Jeep ads claimed it to be the " world 's fastest sport utility vehicle " , verified by third - party testing .
The primary improvements in the 5.9 Limited version included a 245-horsepower 5.9L OHV V8 engine , heavy - duty 46RE automatic transmission , functional heat - extracting hood louvers , unique wide - slot body - colored grille with mesh inserts , special rocker moldings , low - restriction exhaust with three - inch chrome tip , a low - profile roof rack , and special 16 " Ultra - Star wheels .
The 5.9 Limited also received a 150 amp alternator and a 2-speed electric cooling fan .
Other features include a standard 180-watt , 10-speaker Infinity Gold sound system with rear roof - mounted sound bar , standard sunroof , and an interior swaddled with unique " calf 's nap " soft leather and faux wood trim .
The 5.9 Limited was awarded " 4x4 of the Year " for 1998 by Petersen 's 4-Wheel & Off - Road magazine .
Production of this model was 14,286 units .
Export models produced at the plant in Graz , Austria , were given the vehicle designation of " ZG " .

2.5 L TURBO DIESEL VM Motori / Detroit Diesel Not Available in North America 1997 - 1998 5.9 L V8 360 CID SECOND GENERATION ( WJ ; 1999–2004 ) Section::::Second generation ( WJ ; 1999–2004 ) .
The redesigned WJ 1999 Grand Cherokee shared just 127 parts with its predecessor ( mostly fasteners ) .
The European model was coded WG .
The spare tire was relocated from the side of the cargo compartment to under the floor .
( Like the 1998 ZJ , the rear tailgate glass opened separately . )
The two heavy pushrod V8 engines were replaced by Chrysler 's then - new PowerTech .
The new V8 engine produced less torque than the old pushrods , but was lighter , offered better fuel economy , and provided similar on road performance figures ( the 23-gallon fuel tank was replaced with one of a 20.5-gallon capacity ) .
The straight - six engine was also updated in 1999 .
A redesign of the intake manifold added .
While other Jeep vehicles used the Mopar 5 x 4.5 bolt circle , this was the first Jeep following the 1987 Chrysler buyout to receive a wider bolt pattern : – 5 x 5 .
A notable feature available in this generation was the automatic four wheel drive option called Quadra - Drive , which employed the New Venture Gear NV247 transfer case .
This two - speed chain - driven transfer case uses a gerotor , a clutch pack coupled to a hydraulic pump , to transfer torque between the front and rear axles .
The transfer case contains three modes , 4-All Time , Neutral , and 4-Lo .
In 4-All Time , 100 % of torque is sent to the rear axle in normal conditions .
If the rear axle starts spinning at a higher rate than the front axle , hydraulic pressure builds up in the gerotor and causes the clutch pack to progressively transfer torque to the front axle until both axles return to the same speed .
Neutral mode is intended for towing the vehicle .
In 4-Lo , the front and rear axles are locked together through a 2.72 reduction gear ratio .
The NV247 transfer case is mated to front and rear axles containing Jeep 's Vari - Lok differentials .
Vari - Lok differentials also use a gerotor to transfer torque between the wheels on either side of the axle .
The major advantage of Quadra - Drive was that the combined transfer case and progressive locking differentials in each axle could automatically control traction between all four wheels .
However , only the center differential could be permanently locked , and only in 4Lo .
The Quadra - Trac II system included the NV247 transfer case with the standard open front and rear differentials .
The 45RFE and 545RFE automatic transmission in the WJ was notable .
It included three planetary gear sets rather than the two normally used in a four - speed automatic .
This gave it six theoretical speeds , and it would have been the first six - speed transmission ever produced in volume , but it was programmed to only use five of these ratios .
Four were used for upshifts , with a different second gear for downshifts .
Although five of the six ratios were used , Chrysler decided to call it a " 4-speed automatic " .
In 2001 , the programming was changed to make use of all six ratios .
Rather than have six forward gears , the transmission was programmed to act as a five - speed with the alternate second gear for downshifts .
The rpm at on a 545RFE is 2000 rpm , 200 rpm less than the 45RFE programming .
1999 and 2000 model year WJ owners can have their 45RFE transmission 's programming flashed to enable the extra gear as both transmissions are physically the same .
( Must purchase new PCM and ABS module and program them with a fake VIN to make this work . )
The 42RE 4-speed automatic remained the transmission for the Inline 6 engine .
It had slight changes from the previous model Grand Cherokee .
The interior was also completely redesigned in 1999 .
The redesign allowed for larger rear doors , and more space for rear passengers .
Controls for various items like headlights , heated seats , and rear wiper were moved to more convenient locations .
The electronic Vehicle Information center was moved from below the radio to above the windshield , and was standard on all 2000 and up models .
Limited models included automatic dual - zone climate control .
A 10 CD - Changer was also available with the Infinity Audio package .
In addition to Jeep 's UniFrame construction , Daimler Chrysler partnered with Porsche to further strengthen the frame .
This was done to reduce Noise Vibration Harshness ( NVH ) .
UniFrame is an unusual construction scheme , it incorporates all of the strength and durability of a body - on - frame construction into a unitized construction .
By adding stiffness and rigidity to the structure , they enhanced the ride and strengthened the network of steel beams , rails and pillars ( or " safety cage " ) that surround and protect occupants .
More than 70 percent of the underbody is high - strength steel .
All Jeep Grand Cherokees feature UniFrame construction .
The Grand Cherokee received a minor facelift for 2004 including round fog lamps , a lower front fascia and a new body - color matched inset grille design .
Export models produced at the plant in Graz , Austria , were given the vehicle designation of " WG " .

Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV 4WD :
Overall : Frontal Driver : Frontal Passenger : Side Driver : Side Passenger : Side Pole Driver : Rollover : RECALLS Section::::Recalls .
In 2010 , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) launched an investigation into 1993–2004 model year Jeep Grand Cherokees which involves the fuel tanks of these SUVs .
Because the gas tanks are mounted between the bumper and rear axle , a rear collision could cause the fuel tank to leak , causing a fire .
The NHTSA claims that it has reports of 157 deaths resulting from fires caused by Grand Cherokees crashing .
Also affected are 2002–2007 Jeep Liberty models and 1986–2001 Jeep Cherokee models , which totals about 5.1 million affected vehicles .
In June , 2013 , Chrysler Corporation responded to the recall , agreeing to recall 2.7 million Jeeps , though eliminating both the 1986–2001 Jeep Cherokee XJ and 1999–2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee WJ from the recall .
The recall will include 2.7 million 1993–1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee ZJ and 2002–2007 Jeep Liberty KJ vehicles .
Two weeks prior to this recall , Chrysler Corporation claimed that the affected Jeep vehicles were safe , though agreed to recall the affected vehicles later .
To remedy the problem , Jeep dealerships will install a trailer hitch onto the rear bumpers of Jeep vehicles that will protect the fuel tank if the vehicle is involved in a rear impact .
If an affected vehicle is not currently equipped with a trailer hitch , one will be installed onto it , and older Jeep and non - factory aftermarket trailer hitches will be replaced with one from Chrysler Corporation .
Despite the recall , the market for these Jeep vehicles has not suffered .
In May 2013 there was a recall of WKs with the Quadra - Drive II and Quadra - Trac II systems .
This followed cases of cars rolling away due the transfer case moving into neutral of its own accord , and the owner not having applied the parking brake .
The recall revised the Final Drive Control Module ( FDCM ) software .
However , following the recall there were widespread reports on enthusiast web sites of both the neutral and low ratio modes of the transfer case ceasing to function , and a survey showed that fewer than 10 % of respondents had experienced no issues with the recall .
Attempting to resolve these issues , some dealers subsequently replaced the transfer case actuator , FDCM , and even the transfer case itself , often at customer expense and usually to no avail .
The cause of the roll - aways was faulty soldering in the transfer case actuator .
It has been deduced that the revised software detects this by noting any deviation in resistance , and thereupon locks the transfer case in high ratio for safety ; but that it is over - reacting to minor resistance variations from other causes .
Originally Chrysler dealers claimed that the loss of neutral and low ratio following the recall was co - incidence ; then it claimed that the revised software was revealing pre - existing faults in the system , despite it occurring even with new parts .
Chrysler have also claimed that only a small fraction of cars have issues following the recall ; but most users never have occasion to use the low ratio and may never discover the fault .
Four years after this recall its issues remain unresolved .
In April 2016 , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) ordered a recall of 2014 and 2015
Jeep Grand Cherokees and other cars that use an electronic gear shifter because it sometimes does not go into ( or does not remain in )
the park position , despite the operator 's best intentions .
Consumers reported that they put the car in park and left the engine running , and then were surprised when the car rolled away under power .
An investigation by FCA US and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found some drivers have exited their vehicles without first selecting " PARK .
" Such behavior may pose a safety risk if a vehicle 's engine is still running .
The Company is aware of 41 injuries that are potentially related .
The vehicles involved in these events were inspected and no evidence of equipment failure was found .
The vehicles also deliver warning chimes and alert messages if their driver - side doors are opened while their engines are still running and " PARK " is not engaged .
However , investigation suggested these measures may be insufficient to deter some drivers from exiting their vehicles without selecting " PARK , " so FCA US will enhance the warnings and transmission - shift strategy on these vehicles .
The enhancements will combine warnings with a transmission - shift strategy to automatically prevent a vehicle from moving , under certain circumstances , even if the driver fails to select " PARK . "
Jeep has now replaced the shifter with a conventional lever which stays in position for late 2016 models .
In July 2017 , 2012 - 14 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUVs were recalled due to possible alternator failure .
If the alternator fails , the vehicle may stall and/or if the alternator has a short circuit , a fire may occur .
In October 2017 , 2011 - 14 model year Grand Cherokees were recalled due to improperly installed brake shields in some vehicles .
