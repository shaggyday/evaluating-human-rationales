.32
ACP .32 ACP ( Automatic Colt Pistol ) , also known as the .32 Automatic , is a centerfire pistol cartridge .
It is a semi - rimmed , straight - walled cartridge developed by firearms designer John Browning , initially for use in the FN M1900 semi - automatic pistol .
It was introduced in 1899 by Fabrique Nationale , and is also known as the 7.65×17mmSR Browning or 7.65 mm Browning Short .
HISTORY Section::::History .
John Browning engineered a number of modern semi - automatic pistol mechanisms and cartridges .
As his first pistol cartridge , the .32 ACP needed a straight wall for reliable blowback operation as well as a small rim for reliable feeding from a box magazine .
The cartridge headspaces on the rim .
The cartridge was a success and was adopted by dozens of countries and countless governmental agencies .
When the .32 ACP cartridge was introduced , it was immediately popular and was available in several blowback automatic pistols of the day , including the Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless , the Savage Model 1907 Automatic Pistol , the Ruby pistol and the Browning Model 1910
Automatic Pistol to name a few .
The popularity of the .32 ACP in the early half of the 20th century can not be overstated — especially in Europe .
Firearms expert Geoffrey Boothroyd of the UK informed author Ian Fleming , his countryman , that James Bond 's side arm should be a Walther PPK chambered in .32 ACP .
A significant factor in recommending this round was its near universal availability throughout the world in the 1950s .
The .32 ACP has been chambered in more handguns than any other cartridge .
Between 1899 and 1909 , Fabrique Nationale produced 500,000 guns chambered for .32 ACP .
Adolf Hitler was believed to have committed suicide with his personal .32 ACP Walther PPK , by aiming it at his right temple and pulling the trigger while simultaneously biting down on a cyanide capsule .
Heckler & Koch produced the HK 4 , their first handgun , in 1967 .
Twelve thousand HK 4 pistols were produced in .32 ACP for the German police and other government agencies .
DESIGN Section::::Design .
The .32 ACP was intended for blowback semi - automatic pistols which lacked a breech locking mechanism .
It was John Pedersen with the Remington Model 51 that delivered a true locked breech for the .32 ACP cartridge .
The relatively low power and light bullet of the cartridge allowed Browning to incorporate a practical blowback mechanism in a small Pocket Size Pistol .
It is still used today primarily in compact , inexpensive pistols , unless the pistol is used for ISSF competition where the cost then escalates .
Cartridges in .32 ACP are also sometimes used in caliber conversion sleeves , also known as supplemental chambers , for providing an alternative pistol caliber carbine function in .30-caliber
hunting and service rifles .
Some comparison of the " .32 Automatic " as defined by SAAMI and the " 7.65 Browning " as defined by CIP may be useful .
Although some of the cartridge measurements different by as much as 0.16 mm , the names are considered to be synonymous .
However , the maximum average pressure - as measured by a transducer on the test barrel - is according to SAAMI , while CIP allows up to .
This may explain why the cartridges from European manufacturers tend to chronograph at higher muzzle velocities compared to those from American manufacturers .
PERFORMANCE Section::::Performance .
The .32 ACP is compact and light .
While some believe it has marginal stopping power , it has been used effectively by military and police worldwide for the past century .
Weapons chambered in it are often valued for their compactness .
Although .32 ACP handguns were traditionally made of steel , they have been produced in light weight polymers since the 1990s .
Their light weight , very low recoil and very good
accuracy relative to larger caliber pistols make them suitable for concealed carry use .
Some popular pistols chambered in .32 ACP are the Walther PP and the Walther PPK as well as the FEG PA-63 , which is a clone of the Walther PP .
It offers more velocity and energy than the .32 S&W , which was a popular round for pocket defensive revolvers at the time of the .32 ACP 's development .
Although of lighter bullet weight , the .32 ACP also compares favorably to the .32 S&W Long in performance .
Some European 73 grain .32 ACP loads provide similar performance to the .32 H&R Magnum 77 grain lead flat point and 90 grain lead semiwadcutter .
Even though the .32 ACP is capable of killing small game , most handguns chambered for this round utilize fixed sights and are designed for use against human - sized targets at fairly close range , which greatly limits their utility as hunting handguns .
The .32 ACP is one of the most common calibers used in veterinary " humane killers " , such as the Greener Humane Killer .
Given that a .22 LR can penetrate bone , the higher power .32 ACP can easily penetrate an animal skull with a muzzle - contact shot .
As a result , the round has been found to be perfectly suited for this purpose , even where fully grown horses and bulls are concerned .
In Europe , where the round is commonly known as the 7.65 mm Browning , the .32 ACP has always been more widely accepted than it has in America , having a long history of use by civilians and police / security forces , along with limited issue by the military forces of some European countries .
During the second half of the 20th century , several European countries developed firearms for police chambered in 9×18 mm Makarov while chambering the same pistol for civilians in .32 ACP and .380 ACP .
Examples include the Vz .
82 /
CZ-83 from Czechoslovakia , FEG PA-63 / AP 765 from Hungary , SIG Sauer P230 from Switzerland , and P-83 Wanad from Poland .
Today the cartridge has an increased popularity in the United States due to modern compact concealed carry pistols chambered for it , such as the Kel - Tec P-32 , Beretta Tomcat , Seecamp LWS 32 and North American Arms Guardian
.32 .
This increase in popularity has led many ammunition manufacturers to develop new loads for the cartridge to increase performance .
However , these subcompact guns typically have barrel lengths around 2.5 " .
The traditional steel guns chambered for .32 ACP have barrel lengths around 3.5 " .
Different barrel lengths can have a significant effect on bullet performance with longer barrels providing higher muzzle velocity and energy .
For example , a Cor - Bon 60 grain .32 ACP
JHP has 130 foot pounds of energy when fired out of a 2.5 " barrel and 165 foot pounds of energy when fired out of a 3.5 " barrel .
The shorter barrel length can also reduce the range of a bullet .
