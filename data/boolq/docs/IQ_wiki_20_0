GUY 'S GROCERY GAMES EPISODE FORMAT Section::::Episode Format .
The set is laid out in the manner of a typical supermarket , whose 10 aisles are stocked with a wide range of foods that include fresh produce , meat / poultry , and frozen items .
Each chef has his / her own station for preparing and cooking food .
In each round , Fieri assigns a dish and issues one or more challenges / games that the chefs must fulfill .
The chefs usually have 30 minutes to shop for ingredients from the market , prepare , and plate their dishes , unless one of Fieri 's challenges shortens their time .
They must collect their ingredients in one trip and use a standard shopping cart , again in the absence of any restrictions imposed by Fieri .
The chefs must cook their dishes and complete four platings ( one for each member of a three - judge panel and one " beauty plate " ) before time runs out .
At the end of each round , the judges taste and evaluate the dishes and select one chef to be " checked out , " or eliminated from the game with no winnings .
On occasion , the chefs compete through only two rounds instead of the usual three and/or face two eliminations at the end of a single round .
The last remaining chef advances to the bonus round , Guy 's Shopping Spree , for a chance to win up to $ 20,000 in two minutes .
Two different formats have been employed :
* Seasons 1 - 11 :
The chef must retrieve one named item from each of the market 's 10 aisles , receiving $ 2,000 for each one placed in the shopping cart .
* Season 12 to Present : Fieri asks five questions , each of which can be answered with a particular item , and the chef receives $ 4,000 for each one placed in the cart .
On occasion , such as during tournaments or specially themed episodes , Guy 's Shopping Spree is not played and Fieri awards the full $ 20,000 to the winner .
CHALLENGES
Section::::Challenges .
A wide variety of challenges and games are used in the show with new games added as the series progresses ( and some games tweaked or changed a little ) .
Some of the following games have been played once or twice while others have become familiar game staples .
* 123 Game : Chefs must prepare a specified ingredient in two different ways and may only shop in three aisles .
* 2 for 1 Special : Played in the final round .
Each chef must select one of three unusual ingredient pairings and use both items in their dish .
* ABC Game : All ingredients must begin with the same randomly chosen letter of the alphabet .
* Aisle Down : Not announced until the contestants begin shopping ; the aisle containing one or more key ingredients for their dish is blocked off by police tape so the chefs must quickly find an alternative .
* Budget Battle : The contestants are given a set amount of money to shop for ingredients , and may take advantage of coupons or price specials throughout the market .
* Cart / Station Swap : Used mainly in the final round , the two chefs must trade shopping carts or cooking stations , thus being forced to use each other 's ingredients and/or work in progress .
* Can Can : Contestants are only allowed to use canned food items in their dish .
* The Claw : Announced mid - round , contestants have to play a claw game and grab a little plastic ball with an ingredient label on it .
Inside is an undesirable version of that ingredient , which must be used in the dish .
( E.g. a ball labeled " corn " might contain candy corn . )
* Clearance Carts : Chefs must get all their ingredients from three carts filled with assorted odd items .
* Closing Time : Mid - shopping , an announcement is made that the store is closing , limiting the time the chefs can spend in the aisles .
* Express Lane : Chefs may use no more than a specified number of ingredients .
* Flip This Dish : Contestants must use ingredients for one type of dish to create a totally different type , such as dessert ingredients being used in a savory dish .
* Food Pyramid : Like the game " Plinko " , a ball is dropped down a peg - covered pyramid to determine what ingredients , on three levels , must be featured in a dish .
* Food Wheel : One or two wheels are spun to determine the game restriction like mandatory ingredients , which aisles to use , and/or food budget .
The most common variation is the High / Low Food Wheel , in which Fieri spins one wheel consisting of expensive ingredients and a second one of low - end groceries ; the chefs must use both items in their dishes .
* Frozen Food Feud : The chefs are only allowed to use frozen items in their dishes .
* Grocery Bowl : Chefs roll melons toward soda bottles labeled with ingredients or aisle numbers , and must use whatever they leave standing or knock down , depending on Fieri 's instructions .
* Grocery List : Each chef is given a list of items that must be incorporated into that round 's dish ( a mix of specific food items and more generic suggestions such as " something from aisle 6 " or " something under $ 1.99 " ) .
A variation of this game is Emoji List , where the ingredients are represented by emojis .
* Jackpot Luck : Contestants pull a lever on a special slot machine and must use the three random ingredients that appear when the machine stops .
* Keep
It Sample : The chefs must incorporate at least two ingredients from four different sample tables located throughout the store in their dish .
* Kiddie Carts : ( Sometimes spelled " Kiddie Karts " )
The chefs must use child - size shopping carts to collect their ingredients in one trip through the market .
* Let It Roll : The chefs roll a set of dice to determine the constraints for the assigned dish such as required ingredients and equipment , budget , and shopping time .
* Lunch Rush / Dinner Rush : The chefs ' shopping / prep / cook time is reduced from 30 minutes to 20 ( or 15 , on rare occasions ) .
* Meals From The Middle : Contestants can only use groceries from the middle aisles , composed of everything except for fresh produce and frozen food .
* Menu Magnet Madness :
From three rows of refrigerator magnets , the contestants must each pick a flavor ( sweet , sour , smoky etc . ) , a protein ( chicken , tofu , fish etc . ) , and/or a style of dish ( salad , stew , stir - fry etc . ) .
Variations of this game include a player choosing a combination for their competitor , players secretly choosing one magnet each and then revealing them to form a theme that all of them must follow , or Fieri choosing the last magnet himself ( usually something that clashes with the other chosen items ) .
* Musical Carts : Played in the final round .
A song plays during the shopping phase ; when it stops , the two chefs must abandon their own carts , find another one ( usually an opponent 's cart ) , and continue shopping .
Each chef must then use some of the ingredients they did not choose in their dish , adhering to a minimum number set by Fieri .
Variations on this game include switching to abandoned carts with some undesirable ingredients .
*
No Carts Allowed : Contestants may only use the ingredients they can collect in one trip , without using a cart .
They are allowed to use large items as carrying vessels for smaller ones , but may not put any items in their pockets or aprons .
*
Odd /
Even : Based on a coin toss , the chefs may only shop in either the odd or even - numbered aisles .
A variation is Over / Under , in which the toss determines whether the chefs must only use items higher or lower than a randomly chosen price .

Chefs may only get one ingredient per trip through the market , but may make as many trips as needed .

All ingredients used by the chefs must have prices that start ( or sometimes end ) with a number randomly chosen by Fieri .
* Red Light Special : During the round , one item in the store is marked with a sign and a flashing red light , and the chefs must get that item and incorporate it into their dish .
The item is typically not associated with the assigned dish , such as beef jerky for a dessert .

They must collect a total of four items in this manner and use all of them .
