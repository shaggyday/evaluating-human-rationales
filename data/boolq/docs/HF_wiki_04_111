ICTIOBUS Ictiobus , also known as buffalo fish or simply buffalo , is a genus of freshwater fish common in the United States , but also found in Canada , Mexico , and Guatemala .
They are the largest North American suckers , reaching up to in length .
They are sometimes mistaken for carp because of the flat face and large , silver scales running along the body , though they lack the whisker - like barbels common to carp .
Buffalo fish live in most types of freshwater bodies where panfish are found , such as ponds , creeks , rivers , and lakes .
Ictiobus fish were caught by the Lewis and Clark Expedition .
From a fishermen 's point of view , the buffalo fish is not a popular game fish because it is difficult to catch .
Yet , once on the line , it can put up a good fight .
The preferred method of catch is by the use of gill nets .
These nets are set by hand during the night , when they are most effective .
