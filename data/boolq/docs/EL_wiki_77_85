ALCOHOL - RELATED DEMENTIA Alcohol - related dementia ( ARD ) is a form of dementia caused by long - term , excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages , resulting in neurological damage and impaired cognitive function .
TERMINOLOGY Section::::Terminology .
Alcohol - related dementia is a broad term currently preferred among medical professionals .
Many experts use the terms alcohol ( or alcoholic ) dementia to describe a specific form of ARD , characterized by impaired executive function ( planning , thinking , and judgment ) .
Another form of ARD is known as wet brain ( Wernicke - Korsakoff syndrome ) , characterized by short term memory loss and thiamine ( vitamin B1 ) deficiency .
ARD patients often have symptoms of both forms , i.e. impaired ability to plan , apathy , and memory loss .
ARD may occur with other forms of dementia ( mixed dementia ) .
The diagnosis of ARD is widely recognized but rarely applied , due to a lack of specific diagnostic criteria .
On many non - medical websites , the terms wet brain and alcohol - related dementia are often used interchangeably , creating significant confusion .
Additionally , the term alcohol - induced persistent dementia is another nonspecific name that is sometimes used .
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Section::::Signs and symptoms .
Alcohol - related dementia presents as a global deterioration in intellectual function with memory not being specifically affected , but it may occur with other forms of dementia , resulting in a wide range of symptoms .
Certain individuals with alcohol - related dementia present with damage to the frontal lobes of their brain causing disinhibition , loss of planning and executive functions , and a disregard for the consequences of their behavior .
Other types of alcohol - related dementia such as Korsakoff 's Syndrome cause the destruction of certain areas of the brain , where changes in memory , primarily a loss of short - term memory , are the main symptom .
Most presentations of alcohol dementia are somewhere along the spectrum between a global dementia and Korsakoff 's psychosis , and may include symptoms of both .
Individuals affected by alcohol - related dementia may develop memory problems , language impairment , and an inability to perform complex motor tasks such as getting dressed .
Heavy alcohol abuse also damages the nerves in arms and legs , i.e. peripheral neuropathy , as well as the cerebellum that controls coordination thereby leading to the development of cerebellar ataxia .
These patients frequently have problems with sensation in their extremities and may demonstrate unsteadiness on their feet .
Alcohol - related dementia can produce a variety of psychiatric problems including psychosis ( disconnection from reality ) , depression , anxiety , and personality changes .
Patients with alcoholic dementia often develop apathy , related to frontal lobe damage , that may mimic depression .
People with alcoholism are more likely to become depressed than people without alcoholism , and it may be difficult to differentiate between depression and alcohol dementia .
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Section::::Pathophysiology .
Alcohol has a direct effect on brain cells in the front part of the brain , resulting in poor judgment , difficulty making decisions , and lack of insight .
Long - term alcohol abuse can often lead to poor nutrition problems causing parts of the brain to be damaged by vitamin deficiencies .
These problems could also cause personality changes in some people .
DIAGNOSIS Section::::Diagnosis .
The signs and symptoms of alcohol - related dementia are essentially the same as the symptoms present in other types of dementia , making alcohol - related dementia difficult to diagnose .
There are very few qualitative differences between alcohol dementia and Alzheimer 's disease and it is therefore difficult to distinguish between the two .
Some of these warning signs may include memory loss , difficulty performing familiar tasks , poor or impaired judgment and problems with language .
However the biggest indicator is friends or family members reporting changes in personality .
A simple test for intellectual function , like the Folstein Mini - Mental Status Examination , is the minimum screen for dementia .
The test requires 15–20 minutes to administer and is available in mental health centers .
Diagnosing alcohol - related dementia can be difficult due to the wide range of symptoms and a lack of specific brain pathology .
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM - IV ) is a guide to aid doctors in diagnosing a range of psychiatric disorders , and may be helpful in diagnosing dementia .
DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA Section::::Diagnostic criteria .
The existence of alcohol - related dementia is widely acknowledged but not often used as a diagnosis , due to a lack of widely accepted , non - subjective diagnostic criteria ; more research is needed .
Criteria for alcohol - induced persistent dementia in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM - IV ) include the following : There are problems with DSM diagnostic criteria , however .
Firstly , they are vague and subjective .
Furthermore , the criteria for diagnosis of dementia were inspired by the clinical presentation of Alzheimer 's disease and are poorly adapted to the diagnosis of other dementias .
This has led to efforts to develop better diagnostic models .
Oslin ( Int J Geriatr Psychiatry 1998 ) proposed alternative clinical diagnostic criteria which were validated .
The criteria include a clinical diagnosis of dementia at least 60 days after last exposure to alcohol , significant alcohol use ( i.e. minimum 35 standard drinks / week for males and 28 for women ) for more than five years , and significant alcohol use occurring within three years of the initial onset of cognitive deficits .
Oslin proposed the new and refined diagnostic criteria for alcohol - related dementia because he hoped that the redefined classification system would bring more awareness and clarity to the relationship between alcohol use and dementia .
Oslin 's proposed classification of ARD :
* Definite alcohol - related dementia
At the current time there are no acceptable criteria to definitively define alcohol - related dementia .
* Probable alcohol - related dementia TREATMENT Section::::Treatment .
If the symptoms of alcohol dementia are caught early enough , the effects may be reversed .
The person must stop drinking and start on a healthy diet , replacing the lost vitamins , including , but not limited to , thiamine .
Recovery is more easily achievable for women than men , but in all cases it is necessary that they have the support of family and friends and abstain from alcohol .
EPIDEMIOLOGY Section::::Epidemiology .
The onset of alcohol dementia can occur as early as age 30 , although it is far more common that the dementia will reveal itself anywhere from age 50 to 70 .
The onset and the severity of this type of dementia is directly correlated to the amount of alcohol that a person consumes over their lifetime .
Epidemiological studies show an association between long - term alcohol intoxication and dementia .
Alcohol can damage the brain directly as a neurotoxin , or it can damage it indirectly by causing malnutrition , primarily a loss of thiamine ( vitamin B1 ) .
Alcohol abuse is common in older persons , and alcohol - related dementia is under - diagnosed .
A discredited French study , looking at other studies of thousands of subjects , found that moderate alcohol consumption ( up to four glasses of wine per week ) protected against dementia , whereas higher rates of consumption were found to increase the chances of getting it .
NOTABLE SUFFERERS Section::::Notable sufferers .
According to her family , the socialite Leonore Lemmon spent the last few years of her life with alcohol dementia , before dying in 1989 .
The Australian entertainer and " King of Comedy " Graham Kennedy was suffering from alcohol - related dementia at time of his death in 2005 .
