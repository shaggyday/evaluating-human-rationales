LIST OF CANADIAN TORNADOES AND TORNADO OUTBREAKS
This page lists tornadoes and tornado outbreaks which have touched down in Canada prior to the 21st century .
On average , there are around 80 confirmed and unconfirmed tornadoes that touch down in Canada each year , with most occurring in Southern Ontario , the southern Canadian Prairies and southern Quebec .
Canada ranks as the country with the second most tornadoes per year , after the US .
The most common types are F0 to F2 in damage intensity level and usually result in minor structural damage to barns , wood fences , roof shingles , chimneys , uprooted or snapped tree limbs and downed power lines .
Fewer than 5 % of tornadoes in Canada are rated F3 or higher in intensity , where wind speeds are in excess of .
Prior to April 1 , 2013 , Canada used a slightly modified Fujita scale , and as of that date the Enhanced Fujita scale , again slightly modified , was put into use to rate tornado intensity , based on the damage to buildings and vegetation .
Ontario , Alberta , Manitoba and Saskatchewan all average 15 tornadoes per season , followed by Quebec with fewer than 10 .
New Brunswick and the British Columbia Interior are also recognized tornado zones .
All other provinces and territories have significantly less threat from tornadoes .
The peak season in Canada is in the summer months when clashing air masses move north , as opposed to the spring season in the United States southern - central plains , although tornadoes in Canada have occurred in spring , fall and very rarely winter .
The reported increase in numbers of tornadoes in recent years may reflect more reporting by citizens and media involvement rather than an actual increase in tornado occurrence ( although some natural increase has not been ruled out ) , in addition to better detection technology i.e. Doppler weather radar and satellite imagery .
The upswing could also be attributed to other factors , such as improved aerial and ground damage assessment after the fact in sparsely populated areas ( particularly the case in remote parts of the Canadian Prairies and Northern Ontario , for example ) , better trained spotter capabilities and increased use of digital recording devices by citizens .
Tornadoes in Canada are enough of a threat for a public warning system to be in place , overseen by the national weather agency , Environment Canada ( EC ) .
For a variety of reasons , such as Canada 's lower population density and generally stronger housing construction due to the colder climate , Canadian tornadoes have historically caused far fewer fatalities than tornadoes in the United States .
The deadliest tornado in Canadian history , the Regina Cyclone of June 30 , 1912 , does not even rank in the top 25 when compared to American tornado fatalities .
Urban centres are not immune from the threat of severe tornadoes .
Nine medium to large size Canadian cities have been hit by significant strength tornadoes ( F3 or higher ) , which caused large - scale damage and fatalities : Regina ( 1912 ) ; Windsor ( 1946 and 1974 ) ; Sarnia ( 1953 ) ; Sudbury ( 1970 ) ; Woodstock ( 1979 ) ; London ( 1984 ) ; Barrie ( 1985 ) ; Edmonton ( 1987 ) Goderich ( 2011 ) , Alonsa , Manitoba ( 2018 ) and Ottawa - Gatineau ( 2018 ) .
All figures for damages are in Canadian dollars .
