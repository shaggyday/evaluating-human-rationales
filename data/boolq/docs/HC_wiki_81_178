Two days later on Boxing Day , the massive 2004 tsunami inundates the area .
Maria and Lucas eventually emerge from the swirling water and find one another , with Maria having sustained serious injuries to her leg and chest .
They help a young boy , Daniel , from the wreckage and are soon found by locals who transfer them to a local hospital in the city of
Takua Pa. Daniel is separated from them during the journey .
At the hospital , Maria encourages Lucas to help others find their family members while she goes into surgery for her chest injuries .
Meanwhile , Henry , Thomas and Simon have also survived and are together .
Henry leaves the two boys with another family who head to the mountains for safe shelter while he stays behind to search for Maria and Lucas .
While out looking , injured and alone , he is picked up by a passer - by and driven to a nearby bus shelter to wait out with other survivors .
Communication facilities are scarce but eventually a tourist named Karl ( Sönke Möhring ) , who has also been separated from his family , lends Henry his cell phone to contact his relatives .
Henry promises Maria 's father he will look everywhere for his family and that he will find them .
Karl tells the group his wife had left him a note confirming they were at the beach , their location when the wave hit .
He volunteers to accompany Henry to look for Maria and Lucas and his own family , too .
While Maria is in surgery , her medical chart is mixed - up with another patient who has died .
Lucas returns to find his mother 's bed empty and is then taken to a tent where children without families are kept safe .
The mistake is discovered when Lucas can not identify any of the dead woman 's jewelry and he is subsequently reunited with his mother who has been moved to a private room in the ICU .
In the hospital while he waits , Lucas finds Daniel who has been reunited with his father .
Henry and Karl search for their families in various places before they arrive at the hospital where Henry is given five minutes to look .
Karl gives him a piece of paper with his family members ' names on .
The vehicle carrying Thomas and Simon also stops outside the hospital and the boys get off so Simon can urinate .
From a distance , Lucas recognizes his father and while searching him out in the chaotic crowd outside , Lucas ' brothers spot him and they reunite .
Henry finds the three of them together .
He learns that Maria is in the hospital ready to undergo more surgery for her leg , which she survives .
Flashbacks reveal how she came to be badly injured and how she surfaced the water .
While in surgery , Lucas tells his father he has something really important to tell Maria .
The following day , the family boards an ambulance airplane to Singapore
so Maria may receive further medical treatment , arranged by their insurance company .
On the plane , Lucas tells his mother he knows Daniel is safe .

The film was a co - production of Spanish film companies Apaches Entertainment and Telecinco Cinema , and employed much of the crew from The Orphanage , including the director , writer , production manager , cinematographer , composer , and editor .
Principal photography began 23 August 2010 , in Alicante , Spain , and continued in October in Thailand .
Director Juan Antonio Bayona decided not to specify the nationalities of the main characters in order to create a universal film in which nationalities were irrelevant to the plot .
The tsunami was recreated with a mixture of digital effects and real water surges filmed in slow motion created in a water tank in Spain using miniatures that were destroyed by a huge wave .
Bayona committed to working with real water rather than a computer - generated wave because he wanted the story to be authentic .
This meant Watts and Holland spent five weeks filming physically and psychologically demanding scenes in a massive water tank .
Holland , aged 14 at the time of filming , later described it as a " scary environment ...
You can imagine how tiring and brutal that was . "
The Impossible is the second collaboration between Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor after appearing together in the 2005 film Stay .

RECEPTION CRITICAL RESPONSE Section::::Reception .
Section::::Critical response .
Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 81 % based on 188 reviews , with an average rating of 7.3/10 .
The site 's critical consensus reads , " The screenplay is n't quite as powerful as the direction or the acting , but with such an astonishing real - life story at its center , The Impossible is never less than compelling . "
At Metacritic , which assigns a weighted mean rating to reviews , the film had an average score of 73 out of 100 , based on 42 critics , indicating " generally favourable reviews . "
Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun - Times gave a perfect four - star rating , praising the performances of Watts and McGregor , and the direction of Bayona .
He called it " one of the best films of the year " .
Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter gave a very positive review , praising the performances of the two leading stars , stating that " Watts packs a huge charge of emotion as the battered , ever - weakening Maria whose tears of pain and fear never appear fake or idealised .
McGregor , cut and streaked with excessive blood
he seems too distraught to wash away , keeps the tension razor - sharp as he pursues his family in a vast , shattered landscape .
"
About the film she added , " The Impossible is one of the most emotionally realistic disaster movies in recent memory – and certainly one of the most frightening in its epic re - creation of the catastrophic 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami . "
Justin Chang of Variety magazine gave a positive review , praising Bayona 's directing and Sánchez 's writing : " Collaborating again after their impressive 2007 debut feature , The Orphanage , Bayona and Sanchez
get many things right here , starting with their decision to eschew a more panoramic view of the disaster to follow one family 's journey from start to finish .
"
About the performances of the main cast members he added , " Watts has few equals at conveying physical and emotional extremes , something she again demonstrates in a mostly bedridden role , and McGregor , in one of his better recent performances , manages to turn a simple phone call home into a small aria of heartbreak .
Holland , in his live - action bigscreen debut , is wonderful as a kind , somewhat short - tempered kid who still has plenty to learn , setting the tone for similarly heartrending turns by young Joslin and Pendergast . "
Damon Wise of The Guardian gave the film four stars out of five .
He also praised the performances , stating that " as Maria , Watts is both brave and vulnerable , and her scenes with the young Lucas ( the excellent Tom Holland ) are among the film 's best , with adult and child now unexpected equals , the mother humbled , the son rising to the challenge .
McGregor , meanwhile , gives one of his best performances as the sad and desperate Henry , trying to play the hero , the provider , while knowing his cause is almost certainly lost . "
About the film , he added : " Part of the appeal of this affecting and powerful drama is that it puts the viewer right in the moment at every stage , using authentic locations and tsunami survivors to hammer home the reality of this tragedy . "
Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film a " B- " grade and stated that the film " suffers from the greater problem of emphasising a feel - good plot within the context of mass destruction . "
According to The New York Times reviewer A. O. Scott , this narrowly - defined cinematic framing of the disaster through European and not Thai lenses represents " a troubling complacency and a lack of compassion in The Impossible , " a movie which he found to be " less an examination of mass destruction than the tale of a spoiled holiday . "
RESPONSE FROM VICTIMS Section::::Response from victims .
Simon Jenkins , a British survivor from Portsmouth , wrote to The Guardian , stating the film is " beautifully accurate " .
This was in response to critics commenting that the film is " overdramatic " and " whitewashed " .
He says of the comments , " As I must , I 've never been the sort of person to revisit and analyse events of the past , but some of these articles frustrated me .
Had this film been purely about the tale of a western middle class family 's ' ruined ' holiday then I would have agreed .
For me , it was the exact opposite .
Rather than concentrating on the ' privileged white visitors ' , the film portrayed the profound sense of community and unity that I experienced in Thailand , with this family at the centre of it .
Both for my ( then ) 16-year - old self and the Belón family , it was the Thai people who waded through the settled water after the first wave had struck to help individuals and families ...
The Thai people had just lost everything – homes , businesses , families – yet their instinct was to help the tourists . "
Support UK , a support group for survivors of the tsunami , lobbied to have the trailer screened with a warning notice beforehand .
A spokesman for Odeon Cinemas stated that it had no control over the content of the BBFC - approved trailer , saying , " We can only apologise for any offence caused on this occasion . "
