LIST OF FEMALE UNITED STATES PRESIDENTIAL AND VICE - PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES
The following is a list of female U.S. presidential and vice - presidential nominees and invitees .
Nominees are candidates nominated or otherwise selected by political parties for particular offices .
Listed as nominees or nomination candidates are those women who achieved ballot access in at least one state ( or , before the institution of government - printed ballots , had ballots circulated by their parties ) .
They each may have won the nomination of one of the US political parties ( either one of the two major parties or one of the third parties ) , or made the ballot as an Independent , and in either case must have votes in the election to qualify for this list .
Exception is made for those few candidates whose parties lost ballot status for additional runs .
HISTORY Section::::History .
In 1872 , Victoria Woodhull ran for president .
While many historians and authors agree that Woodhull was the first woman to run for president , some have questioned the legality of her run .
They disagree with classifying it as a true candidacy because she was younger than the constitutionally mandated age of 35 , but election coverage by contemporary newspapers does not suggest age was a significant issue .
The presidential inauguration was in March 1873 , and Woodhull 's 35th birthday was sixth months later in September .
In 1884 , Belva Lockwood followed with a run for president .
Her running mate was Marietta Stow , who became the first woman to run for vice president .
The first woman considered for a major party presidential candidacy by an incumbent president was Oveta Hobby , by Dwight D. Eisenhower .
Eisenhower encouraged Hobby to run in 1960 , but she declined .
In 1964 , Margaret Chase Smith announced her candidacy for the Republican Party nomination , becoming the first female candidate for a major party 's nomination .
She qualified for the ballot in six state primaries , and came in second in the Illinois primary , receiving 25 % of the vote .
She became the first woman to have her name placed in nomination for the presidency at a major political party 's convention .
In 1968 , Charlene Mitchell became the first African American woman to run for president , and the first to receive valid votes in a general election .
She qualified for the ballot in two states , winning 1,075 votes .
In 1972 , Shirley Chisholm became the first black candidate for a major party 's presidential nomination , and the first woman to run for the Democratic Party 's nomination .
Tonie Nathan , the Libertarian Party 's vice - presidential candidate in 1972 , became the first woman to receive an electoral vote , via faithless elector Roger MacBride .
In the 1988 presidential election , Lenora Fulani and her running mate Joyce Dattner became the first women to achieve ballot access in all fifty states .
Fulani was also the first African American to do so .
In the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries , Hillary Clinton became the first woman to win a presidential primary , and the first to be listed as a presidential candidate in every primary and caucus nationwide .
Despite losing the nomination in a close race against Barack Obama , Clinton won more votes in 2008 than any primary candidate in American history .
In 2016 , Hillary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party after winning a majority of delegates in the Democratic Party primaries , and was formally nominated at the Democratic National Convention on July 26 , 2016 .
As a major party nominee , Clinton became the first woman to participate in a presidential debate , and later the first to carry a state in a general election .
Clinton lost the election but became the first woman to win the popular vote .
Two women have won the vice - presidential nominations of major parties , Geraldine Ferraro for the Democratic Party in the 1984 , and Sarah Palin for the Republican Party in the 2008 .
The Green Party has run a female candidate three times , Cynthia McKinney in 2008 and Jill Stein in 2012 and 2016 .
Stein received more general election votes than any prior female candidate in 2012 .
