PLOT Section::::Plot .
Benjamin Mee is still grieving the loss of his wife Katherine and dealing with the expulsion of his 14-year - old son , Dylan , from school , and decides to make a fresh start by buying a new house .
He tours many houses with his 7-year - old daughter , Rosie , and his realtor , Mr. Stevens , but finds none he likes until his daughter finds a listing with what seems like the perfect house .
They drive to an old large house and Benjamin inspects the property , telling his realtor it is perfect .
When they hear a lion roar , Stevens explains that the house comes with a zoo in the back , which closed several years before ; if they want the house , they must buy the zoo .
Mee eventually decides to buy the zoo when he sees Rosie happily playing with the peacocks .
Dylan , however , hates the idea of moving away from his friends and retreats into his artwork which has grown more macabre since the death of his mother .
Benjamin 's brother , Duncan , tries to dissuade him from the purchase , but Benjamin buys it anyway .
The zoo staff , led by the 28-year - old head keeper , Kelly Foster , help to start renovating the zoo with the intent to reopen it to the public .
When Kelly confronts Benjamin about why he bought a zoo , knowing nothing about running one , Benjamin simply responds , " Why not ? "
Dylan befriends Kelly 's 13-year - old homeschooled cousin , Lily Miska , who develops a romantic interest that Dylan is oblivious to .
A strict USDA inspector , Walter Ferris , arrives for a surprise inspection and makes a list of repairs that would cost around $ 100,000 , which Benjamin does not have .
Rhonda Blair , the zoo 's accountant , gossips that Benjamin will probably sell the zoo .
The workers ' morale sinks , fearing the property will be sold to a buyer that will close it down .
When Lily tells Dylan that she heard his family might be leaving , he is overjoyed , which hurts her feelings .
Benjamin discovers that his wife bequeathed him an investment account , with instructions to use the money wisely while listening to his heart .
Duncan advises him to walk away and start over with the money , but Benjamin decides to use the money to repair the zoo .
While this lifts the zoo workers ' morale , Dylan is unhappy about having to stay ; he confronts his father , and a heated argument ensues .
They reconcile the next morning and Dylan admits he misses Lily .
Benjamin gives his son advice using his favorite principle , that you only need 20 seconds of courage to achieve great things .
Benjamin realizes that instead of trying to start over by forgetting his wife , he should accept that she will always be a part of him .
Prior to the grand opening of the zoo , the facility passes a very stringent inspection from Ferris , who grudgingly wishes them good luck .
Dylan , following his father 's advice , confesses to Lily that he loves her
and she forgives him .
The week prior to the opening , the worst rainstorm in 100 years is predicted to wash it out .
The weather clears in time , but in the morning they are disappointed when no visitors arrive .
They discover that a fallen tree has blocked the access road , with a large crowd of waiting visitors behind it .
The staff help them to climb over the tree .
There are so many people that they run out of tickets , forcing Benjamin and Kelly to look for more .
They end up face to face in a shed , where Kelly admits to Benjamin that she is romantically interested in him and since she " ca n't get a handle on it " , she kisses him , telling him that maybe they can do it again on New Year 's Eve ; Benjamin kisses her back , and tells her that he is looking forward to it .
Benjamin takes his children to the restaurant where he met their mother , explaining that it was the point where their existence became a possibility .
He takes them through that day 's encounter , where Benjamin worked up the nerve to talk to his future wife with " 20 seconds of insane courage " , and walks up to the table she was sitting .
He visualizes her sitting there , and asks her why such an amazing woman would talk to someone like him .
She responds , " Why not ? "

CRITICAL RESPONSE
Section::::Critical response .
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 66 % based on 160 reviews , with an average rating of 6.3/10 .
The website 's critical consensus reads , " We Bought a Zoo is a transparently cloying effort by director Cameron Crowe , but Matt Damon makes for a sympathetic central character .
" On Metacritic the film has a score of 58 out of 100 , based on 40 critics , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . Roger Ebert , reviewing for the Chicago Sun - Times , awarded the film 2.5 stars out of 4 , describing the film as " too much formula and not enough human interest . "
He added that the film 's " pieces go together too easily , the plot is too inevitable , and we feel little real energy between the players . "
However , he did praise Damon , whom he says " makes a sturdy and likable Benjamin Mee " .
The New York Times reviewer Manohla Dargis criticized Crowe 's direction , writing that it " makes the escalating tension between Benjamin and Dylan the story 's soft center , " while keeping " the brutality of illness and death " " safely off - screen " .
She also noted that the film uses " classic movie logic " , specifically pointing out the way that Benjamin quits his job and that he " does n't agonize about how he 'll keep his children housed , fed and clothed " .
On the other hand , Dargis wrote that " you may not buy his [ Cameron 's ] happy endings , but it 's a seductive ideal when all of God 's creatures , great and small , buxom and blond , exist in such harmony . "
The Hollywood Reporter commented that the " uplifting tale [ the film ] has heart , humanity and a warmly empathetic central performance from Matt Damon " , although it " does n't dodge the potholes of earnest sentimentality and at times overplays the whimsy " .
The reviewer also praised the cast , describing them as " solid " , and in particular praised Damon 's character , whose struggle he says " gives the movie a soulful pull , even at its most predictable " .
Overall , this reviewer summarized his review by saying that " Cameron Crowe 's film has some rough edges , but it ultimately delivers thanks to Matt Damon 's moving performance . " HOME MEDIA Section::::Home media .

ACCOLADES DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MOVIE AND IN REAL LIFE Section::::Differences between the movie and in real life .
The movie 's plot and actual events differ .
The real Benjamin Mee is British .
The story was adapted for an American audience and Mee approved the changes .
The actual zoo Mee bought is Dartmoor Zoological Park , located in Devon , England .
The fictional zoo in the film is called Rosemoor Wildlife Park and is located in California .
In real life , Benjamin 's wife , Katherine , died after they had already bought the zoo and moved in .
In the film , Benjamin bought the zoo after her death .
In real life , Benjamin 's father had died and his mother needed to move ; the farm cost the same price as his parents ' house , and his mother came too .
Benjamin and his family made a specific and informed decision to buy a zoo .
In the film , it occurred as a result of finding a house they liked .
Instead of an escaping bear , as portrayed by the film , it was a jaguar called Sovereign that had escaped .
Benjamin 's children were also younger ( aged four and six respectively ) than the children in the film .
In the film , the zoo was much easier to buy .
In real life , it took almost two years to buy .
Benjamin 's first offer to buy the zoo was rejected due to his lack of experience in the zoological world .
Finally , the real zoo opened on Saturday July 7 , 2007 .
The movie moved that event up to the same date in 2010 .
This later date fell on a Wednesday , but was identified in the script as the original Saturday .
