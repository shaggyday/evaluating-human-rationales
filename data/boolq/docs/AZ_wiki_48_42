After two unsuccessful attempts at retailing , James became a traveling dry goods salesman for a Nashville wholesale grocer .
James left the sales job after 10 years and settled his family in Scottsville , Kentucky .
During the Great Depression , he began buying and liquidating bankrupt general stores .
James ' only child Cal Turner accompanied his father to these closeouts at a young age , gaining valuable business knowledge and skills .
