DEFENSIVE THREE - SECOND VIOLATION
A defensive three - second violation , also known as illegal defense , is a basketball rules infraction in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) introduced in the 2001 - 2002 season .
It is assessed when a member of the defending team spends more than three seconds in the free throw lane ( also called the key , the 16-foot lane , or " in the paint " ) while not actively guarding an opponent .
To be considered actively guarding , a defender must be within arm 's length of an opponent and in a guarding position .
A three - second count is suspended if : * a player is in the act of shooting * there is a loss of team control *
the defender is actively guarding an opponent * the defender clears the painted area
*
it is imminent the defender will become legal
In addition , a player guarding an opponent with the ball may be in the paint without actively guarding the opponent .
The team committing a defensive three - second violation is assessed a team technical foul .
The offense receives one free throw and retains possession of the ball .
Prior to the 1983 - 1984 NBA season , any form of zone defense was considered an illegal defense violation and resulted in a warning on the first violation and then a technical foul for any subsequent violations .
However , the defensive three - second violation makes it difficult for NBA defenses to play zone , since zone defenses usually position a player in the middle of the key to stop penetration .
The Philippine Basketball Association used to follow the illegal defense rule until the 2003 PBA season when it was abolished .
The high school game does not use this rule , nor does European basketball .
The WNBA started using it in 2013 .
