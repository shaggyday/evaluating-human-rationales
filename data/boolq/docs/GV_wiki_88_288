VISAS
Section::::South Korean visas .
South Korea provides visas to cover various approved activities in country .
WORKING HOLIDAY VISA ( H-1 )
Section::::Working Holiday Visa ( H-1 ) .
The Working Holiday Visa ( H-1 ) is issued to young - adult foreigners in some countries which have reciprocal agreements with South Korea .
Holders are allowed to stay in the country for up to one year and engage in some employment activities as well as some educational activities .
However , the main purpose of the trip is intended to be vacation .
People between the ages of 18 and 25 or 30 , depending on the country , are eligible for a South Korean working holiday visa .
A working holiday visa holder can not be employed in certain jobs such as receptionist , dancer , singer , musician , acrobat , or in places of entertainment where they may endanger good morals and manners .
OVERSEAS STUDY ( D-2 )
VISA Section::::Overseas Study ( D-2 ) visa .
The Overseas Study ( D-2 ) visa is issued to a foreigner who are planning to study at the undergraduate or above level of school .
Due to the high cost of education and difficulty in attracting foreign students the government considered granting special work visas to parents of students on D-2 visas in 2006 .
Parents would have been able to remain and work in the country for up to five years .
In the same year it was noted that foreign students often taught illegally to keep up with their finances .
Immigration law allowed D-2 visa holders only to work part - time in some businesses which paid an average of 3000W per hour .
Students were allowed to work only 20 hours per week .
However , students could earn 30000 - 50000W per hour teaching languages as tutors .
In 2007 over 1800 foreigners on D-2 visas were found to be working illegally .
Foreigners who have a D-2 visa are prohibited from working full - time .
2009 saw concern raised over Chinese nationals who overstayed their visas .
There was an 11.7 times increase in overstays on the D-2 and other visas .
It was also reported that " a number " of those entering on D-2 visas from China were doing so only to find a job illegally .
In 2010 68 illegal tutors on D-2 visas were caught by the immigration department .
CORPORATE INVESTMENT ( D-8 )
VISA Section::::Corporate Investment ( D-8 ) visa .
The Corporate Investment ( D-8 ) visa is issued to foreigners who are going to own and manage a small or medium business in South Korea or who are sent as specialists to work at businesses owned by companies outside Korea .
Individuals wishing to apply for this visa on their own must invest a minimum of 50 million won .
The amount of money required as an investment by foreigners to obtain the visa has risen over the years .
In 1991 a foreign investor was required to invest only 25 million won , then in 2001 this was raised to 50 million won .
In 2010 the government announced that it was looking to increase this further to 100 million for a number of reasons .
Due to inflation , a rise in the cost of living and other costs they felt that 100 million was more representative of what was required as a minimum investment to start a business in Korea .
However , there was also concern that some foreigners were taking advantage of the visa and using it to reside permanently in Korea without actually creating any business .
Once the visa has been issued the government does n't keep track of the investment , so some foreigners were using agents who provided the investment money for a fee in order for them to obtain the visa .
Concern was raised that the increase would do nothing to deter abuse of the visa and would instead discourage foreign investment in Korea .
The regulations surrounding the visa and foreign business ownership have been criticized for requiring a Korean guarantor even though the foreigner has invested a large sum of money and been given permission to open nearly any business they wish .
FOREIGN LANGUAGE TEACHING ( E-2 ) VISA Section::::Foreign Language teaching (
E-2 ) visa .
The Foreign Language teaching ( E-2 )
visa is issued to foreign language teachers who work in South Korea .
Applicants are required to be native residents of a country whose mother tongue is the same as the language they will teach and they are also required to hold a bachelor 's degree from that country .
Applications are required to submit criminal background checks , health checks , sealed transcripts , verified copies of their degree , contracts and a fee to obtain the visa .
In 2007 the government introduced several new regulations to the E-2 visa .
Included in these were a criminal record check , health check , and consulate / embassy interview for first - time applicants .
In 2008 several English - speaking countries that were disqualified from applying for the E-2 visa denounced it as discriminatory .
The Philippines ambassador met with Korean Immigration officials to try to persuade them to change the policy and allow teachers from The Philippines to teach English in South Korea .
However , the government had already indicated earlier in the year that they planned to look at expanding E-2 visas to additional countries but it required the approval of various government agencies , so there was no timeframe for when it would come to fruition .
In the same year , foreign instructors already working in Korea also called the rules surrounding the visa discriminatory because they were subject to health criminal and other checks , unlike other foreigners on different visas , such as ethnic Koreans born abroad or foreigners who had married Koreans .
Korean Immigration responded that it was their policy to favour ethnic Koreans and that other nations and territories followed similar policies .
Increasing crime was cited as a reason for the regulations , but some teachers felt it was a knee - jerk reaction to a suspected pedophile who had taught in South Korea , but never had a criminal record in the first place .
Immigration again claimed the right to decide how and to whom it issued visas .
Later in 2009 , a challenge was filed with the National Human Rights Commission in Korea over the checks by law professor Benjamin Wagner .
RESIDENCY (
F-2 ) VISA Section::::Residency ( F-2 ) visa .
The Residency ( F-2 ) visa is issued to spouses of Korean nationals or holders of the F-5 permanent residency visa .
Applicants must provide documents proving financial ability and relationship .
The visa is also issued to refugees who gain permanent residence status in Korea .
Concern was raised in 2008 that " unqualified foreigner teachers " were using F visas like the F-2 to gain employment in Korea .
The government passed a law in 2009 that would change the visas issued to government employees of foreign countries from E7 to F2 .
In 2010 the government announced that foreigners who invested over US$ 500,000 on Jeju Island can also obtain an F-2 residency visa .
It was also announced in 2010 that foreigners already on certain visas would be given an opportunity to change their visa to an F-2 visa after meeting certain criteria and accruing a certain number of points .
