SUN - DRIED TOMATO Sun - dried tomatoes are ripe tomatoes that lose most of their water content after spending a majority of their drying time in the sun .
These tomatoes are usually pre - treated with sulfur dioxide or salt before being placed in the sun in order to improve quality .
Typically , tomatoes spend 4–10 days in the sun in order for the sun - drying process to be complete .
Cherry types of tomatoes will lose 88 % of their initial ( fresh ) weight , while larger tomatoes can lose up to 93 % during the process .
As a result , it takes anywhere from 8 to 14 kilograms of fresh tomatoes to make a single kilogram of sun - dried tomatoes .
After the procedure , the tomato fruits will keep their nutritional value .
The tomatoes are high in lycopene , antioxidants , and vitamin C.
The final products may contain up to 2–6 % of salt and could provide a significant contribution to the day 's intake .
Sun - dried tomatoes can be used in a wide variety of recipes and come in a variety of shapes , colors , and tomatoes .
Traditionally , they were made from dried red plum tomatoes , but they can be purchased in yellow varieties .
Sun - dried tomatoes are also available in the form of pastes or purées .
Sun - dried tomatoes may also be preserved in olive oil , along with other ingredients such as rosemary , basil , dried paprika , and garlic .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Tomatoes were originally salted and dried to preserve the fruit .
Salting and evaporating the moisture out of tomatoes ( as with most foods ) significantly delays the process of decomposition .
By drying ripe tomatoes , these foods could be enjoyed and provide valuable nutrition in the winter when it is difficult or impossible to grow fresh produce .
The true origin of sun - dried tomatoes is unclear .
Italians originally dried their tomatoes on their ceramic roof - tops in the summer sun .
Sun - dried tomatoes surged in popularity in the United States in the late 1980s to early 1990s , where they were often found in pasta dishes and salads , becoming a trend before losing popularity from overuse by the end of the 1990s .
