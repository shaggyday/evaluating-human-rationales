The two teams had met in 10 previous matches , most recently in 2009 in the CONCACAF – CONMEBOL play - off , won by Uruguay 2–1 on aggregate to qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup .
Uruguay led the game 1–0 at half time , through an Edinson Cavani penalty after Diego Lugano was pulled down in the box by Júnior Díaz .
Keylor Navas prevented Uruguay 's lead from doubling by tipping over Diego Forlán 's shot .
In the second half , Joel Campbell equalised when the ball fell to him in the box after a deep cross from Cristian Gamboa .
Soon afterwards , Costa Rica went into the lead when Óscar Duarte headed in a free kick from Christian Bolaños .
A pass from Campbell allowed substitute Marco Ureña to make it 3–1 from a tight angle on the right , and in injury time Maxi Pereira was given a straight red card for a kick at Campbell .
It was the first time Costa Rica scored three goals in a World Cup match , and also the first time Uruguay lost to a non - South American or non - European country in the World Cup .

Section::::Italy vs Costa Rica .
The two teams had met in one previous match , in a friendly in 1994 .
Mario Balotelli had Italy 's best chance in the first half , lobbing the ball wide from inside the penalty area .
Late in the first half , Joel Campbell had a penalty appeal denied , but Costa Rica nevertheless took the lead within a minute , as Júnior Díaz crossed from the left for Bryan Ruiz to head the ball onto the crossbar and over the line from close range .
Costa Rica was able to hold on for the win in the second half , ensuring their qualification for the knockout stage , their first since 1990 , while simultaneously ensuring England 's group stage exit , their first since 1958 .
Costa Rica became the second country to beat two World Cup champions in the group stage of one tournament , the other being Denmark , who had done it twice in 1986 ( Uruguay and West Germany ) and 2002 ( Uruguay and France ) .
Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon appeared in his fourth World Cup ( he was also in the squad for the 1998 FIFA World Cup , but did not appear in any match ) , the fifth Italian player to do so .

The two teams had met in eight previous matches , including twice in the FIFA World Cup ( 1970 , group stage :
Italy 0–0 Uruguay ; 1990 , round of 16 : Italy 2–0 Uruguay ) .
Their most recent meeting was in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup third place match , won by Italy 3–2 on penalties ( 2–2 draw after extra time ) .
After a goalless first half , Italy were reduced to 10 men in the second half when Claudio Marchisio was sent off for a studs - up challenge on Egidio Arévalo .
The only goal of the game came when Uruguay 's Gastón Ramírez delivered a corner from the right which Diego Godín rose to head with the ball going in off his back .
Uruguay 's win qualified them for the knockout stage as the group runners - up , and eliminated Italy from the tournament ; this marked the second consecutive time that Italy had been eliminated at the group stage .
SUÁREZ BITE Section::::Suárez bite .
Around the 79th minute , Uruguay forward Luis Suárez bit the left shoulder of Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini .
Chiellini showed the bite marks to Mexican referee Marco Rodríguez , who missed the incident .
As the Italian players protested to the referee for not penalising Suárez , Uruguay won a corner and Godín scored .
In the 84th minute , a member of the Italian coaching staff was dismissed from the bench by the referee after an altercation with his Uruguayan counterparts .
After the biting incident , Suárez claimed that he " had contact with [ Chiellini 's ] shoulder , nothing more " and that " these things happen " .
On the same day of the match , FIFA opened disciplinary proceedings against Suárez regarding the biting incident .
During the proceedings , FIFA confirmed that Suárez 's previous two bans due to biting incidents ( seven games for biting Otman Bakkal while playing for Ajax and 10 games for biting Branislav Ivanović while playing for Liverpool ) would be taken into account .
Two days after the match , the FIFA Disciplinary Committee banned Suárez for nine international matches , effective immediately , meaning he would take no further part in the World Cup .
It was the longest such ban in World Cup history , exceeding the eight - match ban handed to Italy 's Mauro Tassotti for breaking the nose of Spain 's Luis Enrique at the 1994 FIFA World Cup .
He was also banned from taking part in any football - related activity ( including entering any stadium ) for four months and fined CHF100,000 ( approx .
£ 65,700/€82,000 / US$119,000 ) .
The verdict would not prevent Suárez from transferring to another club .
Suárez later admitted that he had bitten Chiellini and formally apologised , while writing that the " physical result of a bite " occurred in a collision with Chiellini .
On 3 July , the Uruguayan Football Association ( AUF ) appealed against the decision to FIFA , but it was rejected on 10 July .
After an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport , Suárez was later allowed to participate in training and friendly matches with new club Barcelona .

COSTA RICA VS ENGLAND Section::::Costa Rica vs England .
The two teams had never met before .
As England could no longer advance to the knockout stage , their manager Roy Hodgson made nine changes to the starting line - up with Frank Lampard captaining the side .
The match finished goalless , and the draw was enough to confirm Costa Rica , which had already sealed their place in the knockout stage , as the group winners with seven points after three matches .
This was England 's 11th goalless draw in World Cup history , more than any other team .
