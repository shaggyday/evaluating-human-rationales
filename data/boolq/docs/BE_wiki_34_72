HISTORY SQUIBB Section::::History .
Section::::Squibb .
The Squibb corporation was founded in 1858 by Edward Robinson Squibb in Brooklyn , New York .
Squibb was known as a vigorous advocate of quality control and high purity standards within the fledgling pharmaceutical industry of his time , at one point self - publishing an alternative to the U.S. Pharmacopeia ( Squibb 's Ephemeris of Materia Medica ) after failing to convince the American Medical Association to incorporate higher purity standards .
Mentions of the Materia Medica , Squibb products , and Edward Squibb 's opinion on the utility and best method of preparation for various medicants are found in many medical papers of the late 1800s .
Squibb Corporation served as a major supplier of medical goods to the Union Army during the American Civil War , providing portable medical kits containing morphine , surgical anesthetics , and quinine for the treatment of malaria ( which was endemic in most of the eastern United States at that time ) .
BRISTOL - MYERS Section::::Bristol - Myers .
In 1887 , Hamilton College graduates William McLaren Bristol and John Ripley Myers purchased the Clinton Pharmaceutical company of Clinton , New York .
In 1898 , they decided to rename it Bristol , Myers and Company .
Following Myers ' death in 1899 , Bristol changed the name to the Bristol - Myers Corporation .
The first nationally recognized product was Sal Hepatica , a laxative mineral salt in 1903 .
Its second national success was Ipana toothpaste , from 1901 through the 1960s .
Other divisions were Clairol ( hair colors and haircare ) and Drackett ( household products such as Windex and Drano ) .
In 1943 , Bristol - Myers acquired Cheplin Biological Laboratories , a producer of acidophilus milk in East Syracuse , New York , and converted the plant to produce penicillin for the World War II Allied forces .
After the war , the company renamed the plant Bristol Laboratories in 1945 and entered the civilian antibiotics market , where it faced competition from Squibb , which had opened the world 's largest penicillin plant in 1944 in New Brunswick , New Jersey .
Penicillin production at the East Syracuse plant was ended in 2005 , when it became less expensive to produce overseas , but the facility continues to be used for the manufacturing process development and production of other biologic medicines for clinical trials and commercial use .
