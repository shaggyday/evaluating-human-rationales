CANDLELIGHT VIGIL
A candlelight vigil or candlelit vigil is an outdoor assembly of people carrying candles , held after sunset in order to show support for a specific cause .
Such events are typically held either to protest the suffering of some marginalized group of people , or in memory of the dead .
In the latter case , the event is often called a candlelight memorial .
A large candlelight vigil will usually have invited speakers with a public address system and may be covered by local or national media .
Speakers give their speech at the beginning of the vigil to explain why they are holding a vigil and what it represents .
Vigils may also have a religious or spiritual purpose .
On Christmas Eve many churches hold a candlelight vigil .
Candlelight vigils are seen as a nonviolent way to raise awareness of a cause and to motivate change , as well as uniting and supporting those attending the vigil .
