GRAND SLAM ( TENNIS )
The Grand Slam tournaments , also called majors , are the four most important annual tennis events .
They offer the most ranking points , prize money , public and media attention , the greatest strength and size of field , and greater number of " best of " sets for men .
The Grand Slam itinerary consists of the Australian Open in mid January , the French Open around late May through early June , Wimbledon in June - July , and the US Open in August - September .
Each tournament is played over a period of two weeks .
The Australian and United States tournaments are played on hard courts , the French on clay , and Wimbledon on grass .
Wimbledon is the oldest , founded in 1877 , followed by the US in 1881 , the French in 1891 , and the Australian in 1905 .
However , of these four , only Wimbledon was a major before 1924–25 , when all four became designated Grand Slam tournaments .
Skipping majors — especially the Australian Open because of the remoteness , the inconvenient dates ( around Christmas and New Year 's Day ) and the low prize money — was not unusual before 1982 .
Grand Slam tournaments are not operated by the Association of Tennis Professionals ( ATP ) or the Women 's Tennis Association ( WTA ) , but by the International Tennis Federation ( ITF ) .
However , the ATP and WTA do award ranking points based on a player 's performance at a major .
The term Grand Slam , without qualification , and also originally , refers to the achievement of winning all four major championships within a single calendar year within one of the five events : men 's and women 's singles ; men 's , women 's , and mixed doubles .
In doubles , one team may accomplish a Grand Slam playing together or one player may achieve it with different partners .
Winning the four majors in consecutive tournaments but not in the same year is known as a Non - Calendar Year Grand Slam , while winning all four majors at any point during the course of a career is known as a Career Grand Slam .
Winning the gold medal at the Summer Olympic Games in addition to the four majors in one calendar year is known as a " Golden Grand Slam " or more commonly the " Golden Slam " .

The term slam for winning all of the tricks in the ( see also whist terms ) is attested from early in the 17th century .
Grand slam for all of the tricks , in contrast to small slam or little slam for all but one , dates from early in the 19th century .
This use was inherited by contract bridge , a modern development of whist defined in 1925 that became very popular in Britain and America by 1930 .
Grand slam has been used in golf since 1930 , when Bobby Jones won the four major championships , two British and two American tournaments .
Although John F. Kieran of The New York Times is widely credited with first applying the term " grand slam " to tennis to describe the winning of all four major tennis tournaments in a calendar year , sports columnist Alan Gould had used the term in that connection almost two months before Kieran .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The possibility of being the reigning champion of all the current four majors did not exist until 1924–25 , when the International Lawn Tennis Federation designated the Australasian , French ( before 1925 only open to members of French tennis clubs ) , British and American championship tournaments as the four majors .
Before that time only three events :
Wimbledon , the World Hard Court Championships ( held in Paris & once in Brussels ) and the World Covered Court Championships ( held in various locations ) were considered the premier international tennis events by the ILTF .
Tony Wilding of New Zealand won all three of those earlier majors in one year : 1913 .
It has been possible to complete a Grand Slam in most years and most disciplines since 1925 .
It was not possible from 1940 to 1945 because of interruptions at Wimbledon , the Australian and French opens due to the Second World War , the years from 1970 to 1985 when there was no Australian tournament in mixed doubles , and 1986 when there was no Australian Open at all .
Phil Dent has pointed out that skipping majors — especially the Australian Open — was not unusual then , before counting major titles became the norm .
Thus , many players had never played the Austral(as)ian amateur or open championships : the Doherty brothers , William Larned , Maurice McLoughlin , Beals Wright , Bill Johnston , Bill Tilden , René Lacoste , Henri Cochet , Bobby Riggs , Jack Kramer , Ted Schroeder , Pancho Gonzales , Budge Patty , Manuel Santana , Jan Kodeš and others , while Brookes , Ellsworth Vines , Jaroslav Drobný , Manuel Orantes , Ilie Năstase ( at 35 years old ) and Björn Borg came just once .
Beginning in 1969 , when the first Australian Open was held on the Milton Courts at Brisbane , the tournament was open to all players , including professionals , who at that point were prohibited from playing the traditional circuit .
Nevertheless , except for the 1969 and 1971 tournaments , many of the best players missed this championship until 1982 , because of the remoteness , the inconvenient dates ( around Christmas and New Year 's Day ) and the low prize money .
In 1970 , George MacCall 's National Tennis League , which employed Rod Laver , Ken Rosewall , Andrés Gimeno , Pancho Gonzales , Roy Emerson and Fred Stolle , prevented its players from entering the tournament because the guarantees were insufficient .
The tournament was won by Arthur Ashe .
In terms of the current four majors , the first to win all four in a single year was Don Budge , who completed the feat in 1938 .
To date , 17 players have completed a Grand Slam , though only six in the most prestigious singles titles .
Of these players , three have won multiple majors :
Rod Laver accomplished the feat twice in men 's singles ; Margaret Court accomplished the feat three times , in two different disciplines – once in women 's singles and twice in mixed doubles ; and Esther Vergeer completed a grand slam twice in Women 's wheelchair doubles .
The four Junior disciplines , boys ' and girls ' singles and doubles , provide limited opportunities to achieve a Grand Slam .
Players are only eligible from age 13 to 18 , with 18-year - olds likely to hold a physical advantage .
Only Stefan Edberg has completed the Grand Slam in a Junior discipline .

GRAND SLAM CONTROVERSY
OVER TERMINOLOGY Section::::Non - calendar year Grand Slam .
Section::::Controversy over terminology .
In 1982 , the International Tennis Federation ( ITF ) began offering a $ 1 million bonus to any singles player to win four consecutive major titles , no matter the time of completion .
Although groups variously identified as the Men 's International Professional Tennis Council , " abetted primarily by some British tennis writers " , and " European tennis journalists " had advocated for the ITF to change the definition of " Grand Slam " , ITF General Secretary David Gray made it clear that this was not going to happen .
In a 1983 letter to tennis journalist Paul Fein , Gray clarified : The ITF 's plan was to offer the cash bonus for three years , apparently to encourage players to compete in all four major tournaments as much as to reward success at them .
Even before the ITF had announced their bonus , the Grand Slam controversy had taken on a life of its own .
Writing in 1982 , Neil Amdur claimed , " Now the sport spins nervously under the influence of big dollars and even bigger egos , and tradition has almost gone the way of white balls and long flannels [ ... ]
If the four major tournaments want to offer a $ 1 million incentive for any player in the future who can sweep their titles — and such talks have been rumored — that bonus would be a welcome addition .
But changing what the Grand Slam is all about is like a baseball player believing that he ' hit for the cycle ' after slugging a single , double and triple in the first game of a doubleheader and a home run in his first time at bat in the second game . "
Despite seeming clarity from the ITF , some journalists suggested that the sport 's organizing body had turned its back on history and changed the " rules " of tennis by redefining a Grand Slam .
Such confusion continued for years .
For instance , when Steffi Graf completed the Grand Slam in 1988 , George Vecsey wrote , " Even the International Tennis Federation , which should have more respect for history , ruled in 1982 that winning any four straight majors constituted a Grand Slam — and offered a $ 1 million bonus for it [ ... ]
But many tennis people , and most writers , and probably most fans , too , did not accept the new rules , and the I.T.F. has dropped the gimmick .
" Vecsey was only half right : the ITF dropped the " gimmick " of the cash bonus , but it had never changed any rules .
However , the ambiguous way the ITF described the Grand Slam in their Constitution led to journalists continuing to make the same assumption as Vecsey over two decades later .
For instance , when Rafael Nadal was on the verge of completing a non - calendar year Grand Slam at the 2011 Australian Open , one writer observed , " Most traditionalists insist that the ' Grand Slam ' should refer only to winning all four titles in a calendar year , although the constitution of the International Tennis Federation , the sports governing body , spells out that ' players who hold all four of these titles at the same time achieve the Grand Slam ' .
" This was true until later in 2011 , when the ITF edited the description to eliminate all confusion .
As it now stands , " The Grand Slam titles are the championships of Australia , France , the United States of America and Wimbledon .
Players who hold all four of these titles in one calendar year achieve the ' Grand Slam ' .
"
When Martina Navratilova won the 1984 French Open and became the reigning champion of all four women 's singles events , she was the first player to receive the bonus prize in recognition of her achievement .
Some media outlets did , indeed , say that she had won a Grand Slam .
Others simply noted the ongoing controversy : " Whether the Slam was Grand or Bland or a commercial sham tainted with an asterisk the size of a tennis ball , Martina Navratilova finally did it . "
Although the ITF recognizes what is now unofficially known as the " non - calendar year Grand Slam " on its Roll of Honour , no subsequent player to win four or more majors in a row — Steffi Graf , Serena Williams , or Novak Djokovic — has received bonus prize money .
Combining the Grand Slam and non - calendar year Grand Slam , the total number of times that players achieved the feat ( of being the reigning champion in all four majors ) expands to 18 .
ACHIEVEMENTS AND NEAR MISSES Section::::Achievements and near misses .
Three women have won four or more consecutive major titles since 1970 , with Navratilova taking six in a row in 1983–1984 .
On the men 's side , Novak Djokovic was the first singles player since Rod Laver to hold all four major titles at once , which he accomplished between Wimbledon 2015 and the 2016 French Open .
Prior to the Open Era , Don Budge received the same accolades in winning the French Championships in 1938 , but then completed the more prestigious Grand Slam at the 1938 US Championships , giving him six majors in a row , the only male to ever win more than four consecutive major tournaments .
The Bryan brothers ( Bob and Mike ) were the last to achieve a non - calendar year Grand Slam in men 's doubles .
Several players and teams came up one title short .
Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde , known collectively as The Woodies , reached the final of the 1997 French Open while holding all the other three titles , but lost to Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Daniel Vacek .
In singles , Pete Sampras lost the 1994 French Open quarterfinal to fellow countryman Jim Courier , having won the previous three majors .
Roger Federer in 2006 and 2007 , and Novak Djokovic in 2012 repeated this , both ultimately losing the French Open final to Rafael Nadal .
Nadal himself was prevented from achieving this feat by his countryman David Ferrer , who defeated him in the quarterfinal of the 2011 Australian Open , which Nadal entered holding the other three major titles .
In women 's singles , Monica Seles lost the 1992 Wimbledon final to Steffi Graf , having won the previous three majors .
Martina Hingis had a chance to achieve the feat in the 1998 , but lost to Seles in the French Open semifinal .
In women 's doubles , Virginia Ruano Pascual and Paola Suárez had won three majors from US Open 2003 to the 2004 French Open , lost at the semifinals to Cara Black and Rennae Stubbs in the 2004 Wimbledon , and Sania Mirza together with Hingis had won from Wimbledon 2015 to the 2016 Australian Open , but lost in the third round of the 2016 French Open to Barbora Krejčíková and Kateřina Siniaková .
In 2017 , Bethanie Mattek - Sands and Lucie Šafářová had the chance to win four consecutive titles at Wimbledon , but withdrew from their scheduled second round match following an acute knee injury suffered by Mattek - Sands in the second round of the Ladies ' Singles competition .
The following list is for those players who achieved a non - calendar Grand Slam by winning four or more consecutive titles , but who failed to win the Grand Slam during the same streak .

French Open CAREER GRAND SLAM Section::::Career Grand Slam .
The career achievement of all four major championships in one format is termed a Career Grand Slam in that format .
Dozens of players have accomplished that ( column two ) and 17 have doubled it : won a second championship in each of the four majors in one format ( column three ) .
Two or more career championships in all four majors is sometimes called a " Multiple Slam Set " .
Three players have Multiple Slam Sets in two formats , one in three formats , so 22 players are counted in the table ( column three ) .
Their achievements are tabulated below .

GOLDEN SLAM Section::::Golden Slam .
Tennis was an Olympic sport from the inaugural 1896 Summer Olympics through the 1924 Games , then was dropped for the next 64 years ( except as a demonstration sport in 1968 and 1984 ) before returning in 1988 .
As there were only three major championships designated by the International Lawn Tennis Federation before 1925 , none of the tennis players who participated in the Olympics between 1896 and 1924 had a chance to complete a Golden Grand Slam .
However , there was a possibility to complete a Career Golden Grand Slam by winning the 1920 Olympics or 1924 Olympics plus each of the four grand slams , all of which were present from 1925 onwards .
The term Golden Slam ( initially " Golden Grand Slam " ) was coined in 1988 .
Only one player has completed the Golden Slam : NON - CALENDAR YEAR GOLDEN SLAM Section::::Non - calendar year Golden Slam .
Winning four consecutive Grand Slam tournaments and Olympic event in the period of twelve months , although not in the same year , is called a " Non - calendar year Golden Slam " .
Only Bob and Mike Bryan have achieved this by winning the 2012 Olympics , 2012 US Open , 2013 Australian Open , 2013 French Open and 2013 Wimbledon Championships .
After they won the final at Wimbledon , this was coined the " Golden Bryan Slam " .

SUPER SLAM Section::::Super Slam .
Soon after the Open Era began in 1968 , the new professional tours each held a year - end championship ( YEC ) , which are elite tournaments involving only the top performers of the given season .
The subsequent return of tennis to the Olympics in 1988 gave rise to the notion of a Super Slam as a combination of Golden Slam and YEC title .
Eligible YECs are currently called the ATP Finals for men , WTA Finals for women , and the Wheelchair Tennis Masters .
No player has ever completed the Super Slam in a single season .

" Justine Henin 2006 TRIPLE CROWN Section::::Triple Crown .
Winning singles , doubles and mixed doubles titles at one Grand Slam event is called a Triple Crown .
It has become a rare accomplishment in tennis .
This is partly because the final match in all three disciplines often takes place concurrently in the same day if not in consecutive days .
Doris Hart for example attained her first Triple Crown after playing three Wimbledon final matches held in one single day .
Notes :
*
This list excludes the 1909 triple crown of Jeanne Matthey and the 1920 , 1921 , 1922 and 1923 triple crown wins of Suzanne Lenglen .
The French Championship tennis tournament at the time was a domestic competition not recognized as an international major .
At the time the major clay court event ( actual precursor of the French Open in its current international format ) was the World Hard Court Championships , where Suzanne Lenglen also attained triple championship in 1921 and 1922 .
* Also the 1941 triple championship of Alice Weiwers is not listed due to its disputed official status : French championships held in Vichy France from 1941 to 1945 are currently not recognized by Fédération Française de Tennis .

Another Grand Slam - related accomplishment is winning a " boxed set " of Grand Slam titles – which is at least one of every possible type of major championship available to a player : the singles , doubles , and mixed doubles at all four Grand Slam events of the year .
This has never been accomplished within a year or consecutively across two calendar years .
CAREER BOXED SET Section::::Career Boxed Set .
The Career Boxed Set refers to winning one of every possible grand slam title ( singles , doubles , mixed ) over the course of an entire career .
No male player has completed this , although Frank Sedgman only missed out on the French Open singles title .
Men who participate in top / elite level singles have played comparatively few doubles , and very few mixed doubles .
So far , only three women have completed the boxed set during their careers : * The event at which the boxed set was achieved indicated in bold below

She only needed the French Open singles , having reached the final in 1997 and 1999 .
Prior to Hingis , it was Billie Jean King who came close at completing a career boxed set .
She only needed the Australian Open women 's doubles title , having reached the final in 1965 and 1969 .
MULTIPLE CAREER
GRAND SLAMS Section::::Multiple Career Grand Slams .
Of the many players who have managed to win a full set of four majors , there is a small number who have gone on to win all four majors a second or more times .
The completion of " Multiple Career Grand Slams " or sometimes called " multiple slam sets " ( MSS ) has been achieved by only 22 unique players up to the end of the 2015 Wimbledon .
MSS players can be found in each of the five tennis disciplines : men 's or women 's singles , men 's or women 's doubles , mixed doubles .
It can also be found in women 's wheelchair doubles .
Of these , five players have completed MSS in more than one discipline : Roy Emerson , Martina Navratilova , Frank Sedgman and Serena Williams have MSS in two disciplines , Margaret Court has MSS in three disciplines .
This table shows each multiple occurrence of a complete MSS for each of the players who have accomplished multiple slams in a particular tennis discipline .
The year shown for each of the four majors is the year that particular major win was repeated as part of that player 's achievement of their second ( all 22 players ) and third ( 8 players ) and fourth ( 4 players ) and fifth through seventh ( Martina Navratilova , in women 's doubles ) complete slam set of major wins .
For example , the fourth row shows that Margaret Court completed her third career slam set in Women 's Singles — winning each of the four majors three times — during the 1970 Wimbledon Championships ( bold ) .
More specific , she won : Australian open 11 times , the third in 1962 ; French Open five times , the third in 1969 ; Wimbledon three times ( determines the maximum of sets ) , the third in 1970 and finally US Open five times , the third in 1969 .
Grey background shades lesser achievements by the same player in the same discipline ( e.g. , Court in the eighth row )
; yellow highlights the greatest achievement in the discipline ( e.g. , Graf in the third row ) .

Before the Open Era began in 1968 , only amateur players were allowed to compete in the four majors .
Many male top players " went pro " in order to win prize money legally , competing on a professional world tour comprising completely different events .
From 1927 through 1967 , the three oldest pro events were considered " majors " of the pro tour : the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships , French Pro Championship and Wembley Championships .
A player who won all three in a calendar year was considered to achieve a " Professional Grand Slam " , or " Pro Slam " .
The feat was accomplished twice : Three other players won those three major trophies during their pro careers : Ellsworth Vines , Hans Nüsslein and Don Budge .
The pro slams did not have a women 's draw .
