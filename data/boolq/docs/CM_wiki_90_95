Born in Santpedor , Barcelona , Catalonia , Guardiola joined La Masia at age 13 and rose through the ranks of Barcelona 's youth academy for six years , making his début in 1990 against Cádiz .
As Phil Ball writes in Morbo , Cruyff utilised the young midfielder in the absence of the suspended Guillermo Amor .
He became a first - team regular in the 1991–92 season , and at only 20 years old was a key component of a side that won La Liga and the European Cup .
The prestigious Italian magazine Guerin Sportivo heralded Guardiola as the finest player in the world under the age of 21 .
Cruyff 's " Dream Team " went on to retain La Liga title in the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons .
The side was strengthened by the recent signing of Romário , again reached the 1994 UEFA Champions League Final , but were beaten 4–0 by Fabio Capello 's Milan side in Athens .

and I have made many friends .
I can not ask for more .

STYLE OF PLAY Section::::Style of play .
Considered one of the best midfielders of his generation by Johan Cruyff , Guardiola was a highly creative , hard - working , and elegant player , with good anticipation , tactical awareness , and an ability to read the game ; throughout his career , he was deployed as a central or defensive midfielder in front of his team 's back - line .
Although he was competent defensively and able to press opponents to break up play and win the ball , due to his slender build he usually functioned as a deep - lying playmaker , where he excelled courtesy of his technical ability and intelligent , efficient , precise passing game .
Despite his lack of notable pace or physical attributes , Guardiola was highly regarded throughout his career for his vision , close control , passing range , positional sense , and calm composure on the ball , which enabled him to retain possession and either set the tempo of his team 's play in midfield with intricate short exchanges , or switch the play or create chances with longer passes .
Guardiola was capable of being an offensive threat , due to his ability to make attacking runs or strike accurately from distance ; he was also effective at creating chances or shooting on goal from set - pieces .
Having served as captain of both Barcelona and the Spanish national side , he also stood out for his leadership throughout his career .
Guardiola 's playing style , which relied on creativity , technique and ball movement , rather than physicality and pace , inspired several future diminutive Spanish playmaking midfielders , such as Xavi , Andrés Iniesta , and Cesc Fàbregas .

This was one draw better than the previous record holder , his former manager at Barcelona , Louis van Gaal .
Guardiola finished the season with no trophies – the only time he has finished a season without a trophy .
He stated mid - season that the coaching role at City " might be his last team " as manager and stated not winning a trophy , of the four available to City , constituted a " failure " .
However , he articulated his desire to improve the following season .
2017–18 SEASON Section::::2017–18 season .
Guardiola identified the defensive areas which required improvement for City to challenge for the league title , particularly in the goalkeeper and full back position .
He made three major acquisitions in the summer transfer window in goalkeeper Ederson Moraes and wing - backs of Benjamin Mendy and Kyle Walker , while dispensing of all the current senior full backs at the club in Aleksandar Kolarov , Gael Clichy , Bacary Sagna and Pablo Zabaleta .
Additionally , he also signed Bernardo Silva from Monaco and Danilo from Real Madrid .
On 25 February , City beat Arsenal 0–3 to win the Carabao Cup , this was Guardiola 's first trophy with City .
On 15 April , City were confirmed as Premier League champions following Manchester United 's 0–1 defeat at home to West Bromwich Albion .
After finishing the season with a record - breaking 100 points , Guardiola signed a new contract with City until 2021 .
2018–19 SEASON Section::::2018–19 season .
During Guardiola 's third season as manager , City signed Riyad Mahrez from Leicester City for a fee of £ 60 million , a club record .
On 5 August , City began the season with a 0–2 victory over Chelsea and won the 2018 FA Community Shield .
TACTICS Section::::Tactics .
Under Guardiola 's predecessor Frank Rijkaard , Barcelona were known for a 4–3–3 with plenty of flair with Ronaldinho being the centre point of the attack .
Under Guardiola , however , the team became more disciplined with a greater focus on possession and a disciplined and aggressive pressing style .
The leader in defense and Guardiola 's right arm was Rafael Márquez who created chances from the back with his long balls .
He often played a high defensive line with the full backs ( particularly Dani Alves ) pushing high up their respective sides while relying on the passing of Xavi and Andrés Iniesta to retain possession and employing a pressing style without the ball .
During striker Samuel Eto'o 's time at Barcelona , Lionel Messi was deployed on the right hand side , though following his departure Messi largely played in the centre forward role in a false nine capacity .
During the 2011–12 season , Guardiola made increasing use of the 3–4–3 system , especially when facing two attackers , using Cesc Fàbregas as an attacking midfielder and Sergio Busquets as a midfield pivot .
Johan Cruyff previously had used this system as a basic tactical approach when Guardiola played for Barcelona .
Guardiola employed this system in a 5–0 win against Villarreal with Javier Mascherano , Sergio Busquets and Éric Abidal as the back - three and Seydou Keita acting as a defensive midfield .
Of note is that throughout their careers , Mascherano , Keita and Busquets had been deployed primarily as midfielders and Abidal as a full back , meaning Guardiola did not play even one central defender in the 5–0 victory .
This he repeated four years later in Bayern Munich 's 3–0 victory over Bayer Leverkusen , when he fielded a back three consisting of David Alaba , Philip Lahm and Xabi Alonso .
Although there are some spectators who assume the primary reason for the 3–4–3 was because he was short on defenders , in a later Champions League match against Milan at the Camp Nou , he employed this tactic with most of his players available for selection .
As manager of Bayern Munich , he also employed a 3–4–3 formation during the first leg of the Champions League semifinal against old club Barça .
PRESSING AND COUNTERING OPPONENTS ' HIGH PRESS
Section::::Pressing and countering opponents ' high press .
Although much emphasis is placed on retaining possession of the ball and dictating play , Guardiola 's teams are recognised for pressing off the ball .
Players press and harry the opposition collectively in an attempt to win back possession of the ball .
This collective press is only conducted in the starting third of the opposition 's pitch where less space exists and defenders and/or the goalkeeper may not be as good dribbling or passing the ball as a midfielder .
At Barcelona , this was referred as the " six - second rule " , in that the team should aim to win back possession of the ball within six seconds as this was the time when opposition players may still be out of position following turnover of possession and most susceptible to being dispossessed or forced into a mistake .
If possession of the ball was not won back within six seconds , players would abandon the collective press to conserve energy and revert to compact positions with men behind the ball to make it hard for the opposition to break them down .
The ' six - second rule ' has largely been omitted after he left Barcelona .
However , the principle of swiftly winning the ball back following a turnover of possession remains at Bayern Munich and Manchester City .
This pressing tactic has influenced the tactical approach of other managers such as Mauricio Pochettino and Jürgen Klopp as well as those in other sports such as rugby .
As high pressing has become a greater part of football , Guardiola evolved the idea of countering an opponent 's pressing by ensuring his goalkeeper and defenders are comfortable on the ball and capable of retaining possession to counteract .
At Manchester City , he evolved this idea one step further by utilising the fact players can not be offside from a goal kick and ensured a goalkeeper with the necessary kicking force to kick the length of the pitch in signing Ederson .
If opponents pressed City high in their back third from a goal kick , it was not uncommon that Manchester City strikers would run deep into the opponent 's back third .
By doing this it forced opponents back to mark the strikers who could not be offside , thus creating large space in the middle of the pitch for the goalkeeper to chip the ball over the opposition 's aggressive high press , at the same time this would often result in City creating a scoring opportunity .
PERSONAL LIFE Section::::Personal life .
Guardiola was born to Dolors and Valentí .
He has two older sisters and a younger brother , Pere , a football agent .
He is non - religious .
Guardiola met his wife when he was 18 .
They married on 29 May 2014 .
They have three children named Maria , Màrius and Valentina .
Following his tenure as Barcelona 's manager , he stated that he would move to the United States to live in Manhattan , New York , for a year , until he decided on his future .
To prepare for his upcoming position as the manager of Bayern Munich , Guardiola practised German for four to five hours per day , responding impressively at his first press conference there .
Guardiola supports the political independence of Catalonia .
In 2015 , he confirmed that he would participate in the pro - independence coalition Junts pel Sí in that year 's regional parliamentary election .
