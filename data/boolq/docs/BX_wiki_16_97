LIST OF NFL FRANCHISE POST - SEASON DROUGHTS
This is a list of current National Football League ( NFL ) franchise post - season and Super Bowl droughts ( multiple consecutive seasons of not winning ) .
Listed here are both appearance droughts and winning droughts in almost every level of the NFL playoff system .
As of the 2017 NFL season , every active NFL team has qualified for , and won a game in , the playoffs at least once .
Teams that have never made it beyond each successive milestone are listed under the year in which they began NFL play .
Of the 12 teams that have never won the Super Bowl , four ( 4 ) are expansion franchises younger than the Super Bowl itself ( Bengals , Panthers , Jaguars , and the Texans ) .
The Falcons began playing during the season in which the Super Bowl was first played .
The seven ( 7 ) other clubs ( Cardinals , Lions , Oilers / Titans , Chargers , Browns , Bills , and Vikings ) all won an NFL or AFL championship prior to the AFL – NFL merger ; in the case of the Vikings , however , the Super Bowl existed at the time they won their league title , leaving them and the Falcons as the only two teams to have existed for as long as or longer than the Super Bowl that have never secured the highest championship available to them .
The longest drought since a championship of any kind is that of the Cardinals , at 71 seasons .
Note that for continuity purposes , the Cleveland Browns are officially considered to have suspended operations for the 1996 , 1997 and 1998 seasons , Since returning 19 years ago , they have only made the playoffs once , while the Baltimore Ravens are considered to be a separate team that began play in 1996 .
The Ravens , as a result of the Cleveland Browns relocation controversy , absorbed the Browns ' personnel upon their suspension , but not their history .
