UNITED STATES FEDERAL JUDGE
In the United States , the title of federal judge means a judge ( pursuant to Article Three of the United States Constitution ) appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate pursuant to the Appointments Clause in Article II of the United States Constitution .
In addition to the Supreme Court of the United States , whose existence and some aspects of whose jurisdiction are beyond the constitutional power of Congress to alter , Congress has established 13 courts of appeals ( also called " circuit courts " ) with appellate jurisdiction over different regions of the United States , and 94 United States district courts .
Every judge appointed to such a court may be categorized as a federal judge ; such positions include the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court , Circuit Judges of the courts of appeals , and district judges of the United States district courts .
All of these judges described thus far are referred to sometimes as " Article III judges " because they exercise the judicial power vested in the judicial branch of the federal government by Article III of the U.S. Constitution .
In addition , judges of the Court of International Trade exercise judicial power pursuant to Article III .
Other judges serving in the federal courts , including magistrate judges and bankruptcy judges , are also sometimes referred to as " federal judges " ; however , they are neither appointed by the President nor confirmed by the Senate , and their power derives from Article
I instead .
See Article I and Article III tribunals .
POWERS AND DUTIES Section::::Powers and duties .
The primary function of the federal judges is to resolve matters brought before the United States federal courts .
Most federal courts in the United States are courts of general jurisdiction , meaning that they hear both civil and criminal cases falling within their jurisdiction .
District Court judges are recognized as having such authority as is needed to dispose of matters brought before them , ranging from setting the dates for trials and hearings to holding parties in contempt or otherwise sanctioning them for improper behavior .
TENURE AND SALARY Section::::Tenure and salary .
" Article III federal judges " ( as opposed to judges of some courts with special jurisdictions ) serve " during good behavior " ( often paraphrased as appointed " for life " ) .
Judges hold their seats until they resign , die , or are removed from office .
Although the legal orthodoxy is that judges can not be removed from office except by impeachment by the House of Representatives followed by conviction by the Senate , several legal scholars , including William Rehnquist , Saikrishna Prakash , and Steven D. Smith , have argued that the Good Behaviour Clause may , in theory , permit removal by way of a writ of scire facias filed before a federal court , without resort to impeachment .
As of 2018 , federal district judges are paid $ 208,000 a year , circuit judges $ 220,600 , Associate Justices of the Supreme Court $ 255,300 and the Chief Justice of the United States $ 267,000 .
All were permitted to earn a maximum of an additional $ 21,000 a year for teaching .
Chief Justice John Roberts has repeatedly pleaded for an increase in judicial pay , calling the situation " a constitutional crisis that threatens to undermine the strength and independence of the federal judiciary " .
The problem is that the most talented associates at the largest U.S. law firms with judicial clerkship experience ( in other words , the attorneys most qualified to become the next generation of federal judges ) already earn as much as a federal judge in their first year as full - time associates .
Thus , when those attorneys eventually become experienced partners and reach the stage in life where one would normally consider switching to public service , their interest in joining the judiciary is tempered by the prospect of a giant pay cut back to what they were making 10 to 20 years earlier ( adjusted for inflation ) .
One way for attorneys to soften the financial blow is to spend only a few years on the bench and then return to private practice or go into private arbitration , but such turnover creates a risk of a revolving door judiciary subject to regulatory capture .
Thus , Chief Justice Roberts has warned that " judges are no longer drawn primarily from among the best lawyers in the practicing bar " and " If judicial appointment ceases to be the capstone of a distinguished career and instead becomes a stepping stone to a lucrative position in private practice , the Framers ' goal of a truly independent judiciary will be placed in serious jeopardy . "
DUTY STATION
Section::::Duty station .
Each federal judge serves at a particular " duty station " for the duration of his or her federal service .
This is important because of the relationship among several federal statutes .
First , 28 U.S.C. ยง 456(a ) entitles federal judges to reimbursement of transportation and " subsistence " expenses incurred while transacting official business away from their duty stations .
Section 456 also prescribes that the District of Columbia is the duty station of all members of the U.S. Supreme Court , the D.C. Circuit , the Federal Circuit , and the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia .
Second , there are several reasons for why a federal judge would need to transact official business outside of their regular courthouse .
28
U.S.C. ยง ยง 291 and 292 authorize a broad variety of temporary reassignments of circuit and district judges , both horizontally ( i.e. , to other circuits or districts ) and vertically ( so that a district judge can hear appeals and a circuit judge can try cases ) .
Many federal judges serve on administrative panels like the judicial council for their circuit or the Judicial Conference of the United States .
Some of the larger circuit courts like the Ninth Circuit hold regular sessions at multiple locations , and randomly select three - judge panels to hear appeals from all sitting circuit judges regardless of duty station .
( Videoconferencing is sometimes now used to reduce the burden of frequent travel on circuit judges . )
DISCIPLINE Section::::Discipline .
The discipline process of federal judges is initiated by the filing of a complaint by any person alleging that a judge has engaged in conduct " prejudicial to the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the courts , or alleging that such judge is unable to discharge all the duties of the office by reason of mental or physical disability .
" If the chief judge of the circuit does not dismiss the complaint or conclude the proceedings , then he or she must promptly appoint himself or herself , along with equal numbers of circuit judges and district judges , to a special committee to investigate the facts and allegations in the complaint .
The committee must conduct such investigation as it finds necessary and then expeditiously file a comprehensive written report of its investigation with the judicial council of the circuit involved .
Upon receipt of such a report , the judicial council of the circuit involved may conduct any additional investigation it deems necessary , and it may dismiss the complaint .
If a judge who is the subject of a complaint holds his or her office during good behavior , action taken by the judicial council may include certifying disability of the judge .
The judicial council may also , in its discretion , refer any complaint under 28 U.S.C. ยง 351 , along with the record of any associated proceedings and its recommendations for appropriate action , to the Judicial Conference of the United States .
The Judicial Conference may exercise its authority under the judicial discipline provisions as a conference , or through a standing committee appointed by the Chief Justice .
RETIREMENT Section::::Retirement .
Once a judge meets age and service requirements he or she may retire and will then earn his or her final salary for the remainder of his or her life , plus cost of living increases .
The " Rule of 80 " is the commonly used shorthand for the age and service requirement for a judge to retire , or assume senior status , as set forth in Title 28 of the U.S. Code , section 371(c ) .
Beginning at age 65 , a judge may retire at his or her current salary , or take senior status , after performing 15 years of active service as an Article III judge (
65 + 15 = 80 ) .
A sliding scale of increasing age and decreasing service ( 66 + 14 , 67 + 13 , 68 + 12 , 69 + 11 ) results in eligibility for retirement compensation at age 70 with a minimum of 10 years of service ( 70 + 10 = 80 ) .
Under section 376 a survivor 's annuity to benefit the widow , widower or minor child of the judge may be purchased via a deduction of 2.2 % to 3.5 % from the retirement benefit .
NUMBER OF JUDGES Section::::Number of judges .
There are currently 870 authorized Article III judgeships : nine on the Supreme Court , 179 on the courts of appeals , 673 for the district courts and nine on the Court of International Trade .
The total number of active federal judges is constantly in flux , for two reasons .
First , judges retire or die , and a lapse of time occurs before new judges are appointed to fill those positions .
Second , from time to time Congress will increase ( or , less frequently , decrease ) the number of federal judgeships in a particular judicial district , usually in response to shifting population numbers or a changing workload in that district .
Although the number of Supreme Court justices has remained the same for well over a century , the number of court of appeals judges has more than doubled since 1950 , and the number of district court judges has increased more than three - fold in that period .
As of May 2012 , a total of 3,294 individuals had been appointed to federal judgeships , including 2,758 district court judges , 714 courts of appeals judges , 95 judges to the now - extinct circuit courts , and 112 Supreme Court justices .
This adds up to 3,679 total appointments ; a substantial number of appellate judges ( including Supreme Court justices ) had previously served on the lower court bench .
NON - ARTICLE III
JUDGES Section::::Non - Article III judges .
Unlike the judges of Article III courts , non - Article III judges are appointed for specified terms of office .
Examples include United States magistrate judges and judges of the United States bankruptcy courts , United States Tax Court , United States Court of Federal Claims , and United States territorial courts .
Although the term " non - Article III judges " is used to describe the absence of tenure and salary protection , bankruptcy courts are formally designated as divisions of U.S. District Courts , whose district judges are Article III judicial officers .
Moreover , in Freytag v. Commissioner , 501 U.S. 868 ( 1991 ) , the Supreme Court concluded that the judges of the U.S. Tax Court ( and their special trial judges ) exercise a portion of " the judicial power of the United States . "
