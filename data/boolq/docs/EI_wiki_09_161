HOT TUB
FOLLICULITIS
Hot tub folliculitis ( also known as Pseudomonas aeruginosa folliculitis ) is a common type of folliculitis , a condition which causes inflammation of hair follicles .
This condition is caused by an infection of hair follicles due to the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
The bacterium is commonly found in hot tubs , water slides , and such places .
Children are more prone to this because they usually stay in the water longer than adults .
Hot tub folliculitis appears on the skin in the form of a rash , roughly resembling chicken pox and then develops further to appear as a pimple .
Hot tub folliculitis can be extremely painful and/or itchy , and left alone without scratching will go away much more quickly .
If the rash is aggravated , it can stay , worsen , and spread , lasting for months .
By that time , it is much more difficult to treat .
The dots usually go away after about 7 to 10 days but the condition leaves a hyperpigmented lesion that goes away after a few months .
Normally , the rash does not need specific treatment and will go away on its own .
Antibiotics may be prescribed in some cases .
If the rash continues to appear longer than the 7- to 10-day time period , a physician should be consulted .
Folliculitis that is not treated properly could worsen and cause abscesses .
