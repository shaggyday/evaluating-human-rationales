THE WAY ( ARIANA GRANDE SONG )
" The Way " is a song recorded by American singer Ariana Grande for her debut studio album , Yours Truly ( 2013 ) .
It was written by the song 's producer Harmony Samuels , alongside Amber Streeter , Al Sherrod Lambert , Jordin Sparks , Brenda Russell , and Mac Miller , who is featured in the song .
"
The Way " was released on March 25 , 2013 by Republic Records as the lead single from Yours Truly .
The song 's backing track is based on the piano melody from Russell 's 1979 song " A Little Bit of Love " , and the song has melodic and lyrical similarities to Big Pun 's 1998 song " Still Not a Player " , which also samples " A Little Bit of Love " .
In the United States , " The Way " debuted at No . 10 and peaked at No . 9 on US Billboard Hot 100 , becoming Grande and Miller 's first top ten song on the chart .
This also made Grande the first top ten arrival for a lead female artist making her first Hot 100 appearance since Yael Naim , who launched with " New Soul " back in 2008 .
As of April 2018 , " The Way " has sold 2.4 million copies in the United States and has been certified triple platinum .
BACKGROUND Section::::Background .
On December 12 , 2011 , Grande released her debut single " Put Your Hearts Up , " a bubblegum pop song with a vastly different style of music and target demographic than " The Way .
" Whereas the lyrics in " The Way " deal with the subject of a flirty , romantic relationship , some sections with sexual implications , " Put Your Hearts Up " was a song aimed at young audiences , with lyrics about making the world a better place .
During a radio interview on KIIS - FM on March 25 , 2013 about her debut single , Grande confessed that she had in fact " hated " both the music video for and the song itself , considering it to be " a terrible first impression . "
She added that she had wanted to " pretend it never happened before it already happened " and that she had felt no enthusiasm to promote the song at the time .
In subsequent interviews , Grande implied that in order to feel " passionate " about her music , it needed to relate to her maturing personality .
In an interview with Billboard she said , " When I do Sam & Cat , and when I act as Cat , of course I 'm still going to be there for my younger fans .
But I 'm also growing up â€“ I 'm almost 20 .
I 'm not going to do anything crazy , but I want to do music that I 'm passionate about .
I 'm finally at an age where I can do the music that I grew up loving , which was urban pop , 90s music .
I grew up listening to the divas , so I 'm very happy to finally do urban pop .
I hope that it 's received well , and it has been so far . "
" The Way " can be seen as the reboot of Grande 's singing career , steering her toward an older demographic and a different musical genre than where she originally began .
In January 2013 , she met with producer Harmony Samuels , at which point he presented her with a demo of the song that featured the vocals of co - writer Jordin Sparks , whom the song was originally intended .
The beat he 'd created for the single , samples Brenda Russell 's " A Little Bit of Love " either directly or indirectly , via Big Pun 's " Still Not a Player " .
Grande immediately connected with the sound and asked Mac Miller to feature on the song with her , to which he responded , " Sounds like a hit to me .
"
The song was recorded that same month , and caught the attention of Republic Records VP Charlie Walk when he heard it being played from Republic co - founder Monte Lipman 's office .
" It was 8:00 one night , and I heard a song coming from Monte 's office through my wall .
He called me down and I played a video , a DIY of Ariana Grande .
We heard the song and I immediately made the decision to set it up [ and ] put the song out . "

COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT

On December 11 , 2013 , Minder Music filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Grande , Sony / ATV , UMG Recording and other parties .
It claimed that the line " What we got ta do right here is go back , back into time " , which is spoken in the introduction to " The Way " , infringes its copyright in the 1972 single " Troglodyte " by The Jimmy Castor Bunch , which contains the spoken lyric , " What we 're gon na do right here is go back , way back , back into time " .
The suit argued that the songs ' similarities include " nearly identical lyrics ; similar enunciation speed with a fast and consistent pace for ' What we got ta do right ' and a slightly slower pace for ' here is go back , ' and substantially similar placement " at the beginning of both songs .
Minder Music sought a permanent injunction , statutory damages of $ 150,000 per infringement , and legal fees .
The case was settled outside of court in 2015 .
