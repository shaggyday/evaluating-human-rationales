BACKGROUND Section::::Background .
Lead singer Gary Lightbody reportedly wrote the song when he became sober after a binge of white wine , in the garden of song producer Jacknife Lee 's Kent cottage .
The song has Lightbody singing a plain melody over sparse guitars , which has an ever - building crescendo .
In an interview with Rolling Stone , he said " It 's the purest love song that I 've ever written .
There 's no knife - in - the - back twist .
When I read these lyrics back , I was like , ' Oh , that 's weird . '
All the other love songs I 've written have a dark edge .
"
The phrase " Chasing Cars " came from Lightbody 's father , in reference to a girl Lightbody was infatuated with , " You 're like a dog chasing a car .
You 'll never catch it
and you just would n't know what to do with it if you did . "

Music 's Adam Webb , however , had mixed feelings for the single , when he awarded it 5 stars out of 10 , saying it was a " misguided attempt to recreate its breast - beating slo - motion scarf - waving formula . "
Further , he made comparisons of the song to Hollywood soundtracks , which in his words are " about as subtle as a rhino and too overt to be truly affecting . "
The song was nominated for a 2007 Grammy Award for Best Rock Song as well as for a 2007 BRIT Award for Best British Single .
In 2007 , " Chasing Cars " was voted number 1 in the Top 500 Songs : The Words Behind the Music , on Bristol 's GWR FM ( and other stations in The One Network ) .
UK music licensing body PPL announced in December 2009 that " Chasing Cars " was the most played song of the decade .
COMMERCIAL PERFORMANCE Section::::Commercial performance .
" Chasing Cars " was released as an overlapping single in early June , and the video was re - edited to include clips from Grey 's Anatomy .
The video failed to catch on , regardless , so a third version was filmed for the edited single version of the song .
On 13 September 2006 , the song soared in the digital music charts to become the most - downloaded song in the U.S. iTunes Store , just one day after the DVD release of the second season of Grey 's Anatomy .
The song was used in Verbotene Liebe , a German soap opera .
The song was released as a download - only single on 17 July 2006 and entered the UK Singles Chart in the week ending 29 July at number 25 on the strength of download sales alone .
Its physical release on 24 July pushed the song up to number 15 , peaking six weeks later at number 6 .
However , seven weeks after that , in November the CD single was deleted and , under the chart rules prevailing at that time , the song was removed from the chart two weeks after that , having clocked up 17 weeks in total .
It was then absent from the chart for seven weeks , but in January 2007 , a change to the chart rules meant that all downloads , with or without a physical equivalent , were now eligible to chart . "
Chasing Cars " duly surged back in at a top 10 position ( number 9 , just three places below its peak ) , and remained on the chart for 48 consecutive weeks , entirely on downloads , only falling out again in December .
After a three - week absence , in January 2008 it was back again , for 13 weeks this time , peaking at No . 50 .
It then bowed out for a third time , re - entered the top 75 in June , August , October and November 2008 , November 2009 , January and December 2010 , and March , July and December 2011 , and re - entered again on 24 August 2013 , charting at No . 66 before climbing up to No . 60 the following week , and up to No . 47 the week after , now taking the song 's tally up to an incredible 111 weeks on the UK Top 75 , making it the 2nd longest runner of all time , bettered only by Frank Sinatra 's " My Way " ( 124 weeks ) .
Only for 14 weeks out of those 111 was a physical copy of " Chasing Cars " officially available .
It has also spent 166 weeks on the Top 100 .
It sold its millionth copy in the UK in October 2013 .
A physical release of the song did not occur at all in Australia , where the song spent 10 weeks over summer 2006/2007 at number one on the Digital Track Chart .
Under ARIA chart rules at the time , songs that had a digital - only release were ineligible to chart .
When the rules finally changed in October 2007 to include digital - only singles ( partly due to declining physical sales ) , " Chasing Cars " had dwindled in popularity and only managed to peak at number 53 .
Its sales prior to the week it began charting on the official singles chart were not counted ; regardless , it spent a further 63 weeks in the lower half of the chart and was later certified triple platinum ( for over 210,000 downloads ) .
" Chasing Cars " was voted number one in a 2006 Virgin Radio Top 500 Songs of All Time poll .
After the popularity of its association with the Grey 's Anatomy television show , the song peaked at No . 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US , the band 's first Top 10 hit in the US .
The song peaked at No . 8 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart .
It was the fourth best selling digital single of 2006 in the UK , totalling 190,000 legal downloads , and is the UK 's 26th most downloaded song of all time . "
Chasing Cars " also went to number one on the Adult Contemporary chart for two non - consecutive weeks .
As of February 2015 , the song has sold 3,900,000 copies in the US .
