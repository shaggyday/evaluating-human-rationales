QUICK RATIO
In finance , the quick ratio , also known as the acid - test ratio is a type of liquidity ratio which measures the ability of a company to use its near cash or quick assets to extinguish or retire its current liabilities immediately .
Quick assets include those current assets that presumably can be quickly converted to cash at close to their book values .
It is the ratio between quickly available or liquid assets and current liabilities .
A normal liquid ratio is considered to be 1:1 .
A company with a quick ratio of less than 1 can not currently fully pay back its current liabilities .
This ratio is considered to be much better and reliable as a tool for assessment of liquidity position of firms .
FORMULA Section::::Formula .
formula_1 or specifically : formula_2 Note that inventory is excluded from the sum of assets in the quick ratio , but included in the current ratio .
Ratios are tests of viability for business entities but do not give a complete picture of the business ' health .
If a business has large amounts in accounts receivable which are due for payment after a long period ( say 120 days ) , and essential business expenses and accounts payable due for immediate payment , the quick ratio may look healthy when the business is actually about to run out of cash .
In contrast , if the business has negotiated fast payment or cash from customers , and long terms from suppliers , it may have a very low quick ratio and yet be very healthy .
More detailed analysis of all major payables and receivables in line with market sentiments and adjusting input data accordingly shall give more sensible outcomes which shall give actionable insights .
Generally , the acid test ratio should be 1:1 or higher ; however , this varies widely by industry .
In general , the higher the ratio , the greater the company 's liquidity ( i.e. , the better able to meet current obligations using liquid assets ) . SEE ALSO * Current ratio * Financial Accounting REFERENCES
