PURPLE LINE ( LOS ANGELES METRO )
The Purple Line is a heavy rail subway line operating in Los Angeles , running between downtown and the Mid - Wilshire / Koreatown districts .
It is one of six lines on the Metro Rail System , operated by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority .
The Metro Purple Line is one of the city 's two subway lines ( along with the Metro Red Line ) .
Although they separate west of Downtown Los Angeles , the two subway lines ( Purple and Red ) were originally branded as two branches of the Red Line .
The Purple Line was instituted as its own line , separate from the Red Line , in 2006 .
, the combined Red and Purple lines averaged 169,478 boardings per weekday .
Out of the eight stations served , only two of them are exclusive to the Purple Line , with the other six shared with the Red Line .
Beginning in 2019 , the line will be renamed to the D Line while retaining its purple coloring .
SERVICE DESCRIPTION
ROUTE Section::::Service description .
Section::::Route .
The Metro Purple Line is a line that begins at Union Station .
At Union Station , passengers can connect to the Metro Silver Line bus rapid transit line , and the Metro Gold Line .
The Purple Line travels southwest through Downtown Los Angeles , passing the Civic Center , Pershing Square ( near the Historic Core ) and the Financial District .
Passengers can connect to the Metro Silver Line ( both directions ) at Civic Center Station .
At Pershing Square Station , passengers can board the northbound Metro Silver Line bus at Olive Street/5th Street .
At Station , travelers can connect to the Metro Blue Line , Metro Expo Line and the Metro Silver Line .
From here , the train travels between 7th Street and Wilshire Boulevard ( and briefly Ingraham Street ) west through Pico - Union and Westlake , arriving at in the city 's Mid - Wilshire / Koreatown district .
Up to this point , track is shared with the Metro Red Line : at Wilshire / Vermont , the two lines diverge .
The Purple Line continues west for one additional mile , and terminates at .
DUPLICATE SERVICE
ON WILSHIRE Section::::Duplicate service on Wilshire .
The Purple Line runs underground , below Wilshire Boulevard which is served on the surface by Metro Local route 20 and Metro Rapid route 720 .
Despite the duplicate service , Metro considers the redundant bus service justified because both bus routes run frequently from Downtown Los Angeles .
Unlike the Purple Line , they run along the entire Wilshire corridor , west to Beverly Hills , Westwood and Santa Monica .
HOURS OF OPERATION Section::::Hours of operation .
Trains run between approximately 4:45 a.m. and 11:30 p.m. daily , with late night weekend service running until approximately 2:00 a.m.
First and last train times are as follows : To /
From Wilshire /
Western
During the evenings Purple Line trains sometimes run as shuttles .
Passengers must transfer to a Red Line train at Wilshire / Vermont .
This will change once the Purple Line is extended to Westwood .
HEADWAYS Section::::Headways .
Trains on the Purple Line operate every ten minutes during peak hours Monday through Friday .
They operate every twelve minutes during the daytime weekdays and all day on the weekends after approximately 10 a.m. ( with a 15-minute headway early Saturday and Sunday mornings ) .
Night service can range between 20â€“30 minutes .
RIDERSHIP Section::::Ridership .
The Purple Line is utilized mostly as a downtown shuttle on its shared segment with the Red Line .
The stub between Vermont and Western has a very low ridership .
According to Metro Service Coordinator Conan Cheung , the stub is operating 11 % full during peak hours , and even lower at other times .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The current Purple Line is the product of a long - term plan to connect Downtown Los Angeles to central and western portions of the city with a heavy rail subway system .
Originally planned in the 1980s to travel west down Wilshire Boulevard to Fairfax Avenue and then north to the San Fernando Valley , a methane explosion at a Ross Dress for Less clothing store near Fairfax in 1985 , just as construction got underway , led to a legal prohibition on tunnelling in a large part of Mid - Wilshire .
Instead , after some wrangling , a new route was chosen up Vermont Avenue to Hollywood Boulevard .
However , a short one - mile branch down Wilshire from Vermont to Western was allowed to remain in the system .
The service currently designated as the Purple Line opened in two minimum operating segments : * MOS-1 , which consisted of the original five stations from to , opened on January 30 , 1993 .
* MOS-2A , including three new stations between and , opened in 1996 .
The Vermont branch began service in 1999 .
Initially , both branches were designated as part of the Red Line , but in 2006 trains travelling between Union Station and Wilshire / Western were rebranded the Purple Line for greater clarity .
CURRENT AND PROPOSED EXTENSION Section::::Current and proposed extension .
Metro is now aiming to complete the subway to the Westside .
The new project is called the Purple Line Extension ( the project was previously called the Westside Subway Extension ) and the first phase broke ground on November 7 , 2014 .
Metro released the Final Environmental Impact Report ( FEIR ) on March 19 , 2012 , and the first phase of the project ( to Wilshire / La Cienega ) was approved by Metro 's Board of Directors on April 26 , 2012 .
Notice to proceed was issued to Tutor Perini on April 26 , 2017 for phase two from Wilshire / La Cienega Station to Century City / Constellation Station .
Pre - construction has commenced .
Metro is still attempting to obtain funding for phase three .

Section::::Maintenance .
The Purple Line is operated out of the Division 20 Yard ( Santa Fe Yard ) located at 320 South Santa Fe Avenue Los Angeles .
This yard stores the fleet used on the Red and Purple Line .
It is also where heavy maintenance is done on the fleet .
Subways get to this yard by continuing on after Union Station .
Trains make a right turn before coming to surface level at Ducommun Street , and then travel south to 1st Street where they enter the yard .
ROLLING STOCK Section::::Rolling stock .
The Purple Line uses Breda A650 electric multiple unit cars built by Breda in Italy .
Trains usually run in four - car consists during peak hours and two - car consists outside of peak hours .
The acceleration for cars # 531 and up is similar to that of cars used by the Washington Metro because they both use General Electric traction motors .
The cars are maintained in a Metro yard on Santa Fe Drive near 4th Street alongside the Los Angeles River in Downtown Los Angeles .
In March 2017 , Metro ordered new CRRC HR4000 railcars , some of which will operate on the Purple Line once the extension is completed .
