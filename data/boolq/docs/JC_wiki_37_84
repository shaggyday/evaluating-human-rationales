While conceiving and writing the first series of Broadchurch in 2012 , Chris Chibnall designed his story to be told as a trilogy but , of course , the first series had to be self - contained in case the show did not do well in the ratings and a second series was not commissioned .
When he pitched series one to ITV , in the autumn of 2012 , he pitched series two and three at the same time .
On 1 December 2014 , a number of media outlets reported that ITV had commissioned a third series of Broadchurch .
The Sun first reported the news , claiming Chibnall was rushing to finish a script so that filming could begin in Dorset in July 2015 .
On 23 February 2015 , ITV confirmed that Broadchurch , as well as David Tennant and Olivia Colman , would return for a third series , repeating the use of " Broadchurch will return " after the closing credits .
Jane Featherstone and Chris Chibnall continued as executive producers of the programme in series three , with Dan Winch replacing Richard Stokes as producer for the final series .
Chibnall is the lead writer .
WRITING Section::::Writing .
Filming for the third series began in May 2016 and broadcast started on 27 February 2017 .
The final series follows Miller and Hardy as they investigate a serious sexual assault .
Creator Chris Chibnall said , " We have one last story to tell , featuring both familiar faces and new characters .
I hope it 's a compelling and emotional farewell to a world and show that means so much to me . "
The Shores and Dorset Rape Crisis have advised Chibnall throughout writing the scripts .
