CAREER BACKGROUND
Section::::Career . Section::::Background .
Pentatonix began with Kirstin " Kirstie " Maldonado ( born May 16 , 1992 ) , Mitchell " Mitch " Grassi ( born July 24 , 1992 ) , and Scott Hoying ( born September 17 , 1991 ) who grew up together and were schoolmates at Martin High School in Arlington , Texas .
For a local radio show competition to meet the cast of Glee , they arranged and submitted a trio version of " Telephone " .
Despite losing the competition , their singing sparked attention at their school , and they began performing .
Their version of " Telephone " by Lady Gaga featuring Beyoncé subsequently gained attention on YouTube .
Hoying and Maldonado both graduated from Martin High School in 2010 , Grassi in 2011 .
Hoying went off to the University of Southern California ( USC ) to pursue a bachelor 's degree in Popular Music , while Maldonado pursued a Musical Theater major at the University of Oklahoma .
While at USC , Scott Hoying joined an a cappella group called SoCal VoCals .
He found out about The Sing - Off from another member of the group , Ben Bram ( also their arranger , producer , and sound engineer ) , and was encouraged to audition for the show .
He persuaded Maldonado and Grassi to join him , but Bram suggested having a bass and beatboxer as well to support the group Through a mutual friend , Hoying met Avriel " Avi " Kaplan ( born April 17 , 1989 ) , a highly recognized vocal bass in the a cappella community .
Then , the trio found Kevin Olusola ( born October 5 , 1988 ) on YouTube , where one of his videos in which he was simultaneously beatboxing and playing the cello ( called " celloboxing " ) had gone viral .
Olusola was born in Owensboro , Kentucky , and graduated pre - med from Yale University .
He speaks fluent Mandarin after spending a year studying in China .
The group met the day before the auditions for the third season of The Sing - Off began .
The group successfully auditioned for the show and eventually went on to win the title for 2011 ( season three ) .
Pentatonix , as suggested by Scott Hoying , is named after the pentatonic scale , a musical scale or mode with five notes per octave , representing the five members of the group .
They replaced the last letter with an " x " to make it more appealing .
The quintet derives its influences from pop , dubstep , electro , reggae , hip hop , and classical music .
