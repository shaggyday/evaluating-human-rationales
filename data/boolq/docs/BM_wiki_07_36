FINANCE CHARGE
In United States law , a finance charge is any fee representing the cost of credit , or the cost of borrowing .
It is interest accrued on , and fees charged for , some forms of credit .
It includes not only interest but other charges as well , such as financial transaction fees .
Details regarding the federal definition of finance charge are found in the Truth - in - Lending Act and Regulation Z , promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board .
In personal finance , a finance charge may be considered simply the dollar amount paid to borrow money , while interest is a percentage amount paid such as annual percentage rate ( APR ) .
These definitions are narrower than the typical dictionary definitions or accounting definitions .
Creditors and lenders use different methods to calculate finance charges .
The most common formula is based on the average daily balance , in which daily outstanding balances are added together and then divided by the number of days in the month .
In financial accounting , interest is defined as any charge or cost of borrowing money .
Interest is a synonym for finance charge .
In effect , the accountant looks at the entire cost of settlement on a Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) form 1
( the HUD-1 Settlement Statement ) document as interest unless that charge can be identified as an escrow amount or an amount that is charged to current expenses or expenditures other than interest , such as payment of current or prorated real estate taxes .
