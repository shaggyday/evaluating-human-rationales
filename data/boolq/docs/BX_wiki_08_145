COUSIN Commonly , " cousin " refers to a " first cousin " , people whose most recent common ancestor is a grandparent .
A first cousin used to be known as a cousin - german , though this term is rarely used today .
More generally , cousin is a type of familial relationship in which people with a known common ancestor are both two or more generations away from their most recent common ancestor .
This distinguishes a cousin from an ancestor , descendant , sibling , aunt , uncle , niece , or nephew .
Systems of " degrees " and " removals " are used in the English - speaking world to describe the exact relationship between two cousins ( in the broad sense ) and the ancestor they have in common .
Various governmental entities have established systems for legal use that can precisely specify kinship with common ancestors any number of generations in the past .
Common usage often eliminates the degrees and removals , and refers to people with common ancestry as simply " distant cousins " or " relatives " .
BASIC DEFINITIONS Section::::Basic definitions .
People are related with a type of cousin relationship if they share a common ancestor and the most recent common ancestor is two or more generations away from both people .
This means neither person is an ancestor of the other , they do not share a parent ( siblings ) , and neither is a sibling of a common ancestor ( aunts / uncles and nieces / nephews ) .
The cousin relationship is further detailed by degree and removal .
For example , the second cousin once removed relationship is a second - degree cousin with one removal .
The removal of the cousin relationship is the number of generations the cousins are apart .
When the cousins are separated by a different number of generations from the most recent common ancestor , the cousin relationship is removed .
The difference between the number of generations for each cousin is the removal .
For example , if the most recent common ancestor is 2 generations prior for one person and 3 generations prior for the other ( one person 's grandfather is the other person 's great - grandfather ) or the most recent common ancestor is 3 generations prior for one person and 4 generations prior for the other ( one person 's great - grandfather is the other person 's great - great - grandfather )
the cousins are separated by one generation and therefore once removed .
Note that two people can be removed but be around the same age due to differences in birth dates of parents children and other relevant ancestors .
The degree of the cousin relationship is the number of generations prior to the parents before a most recent common ancestor is found .
If the cousins are removed , the smaller number of generations to the most recent common ancestor is used to determine the degree of the cousin relationship .
For example , if one of the cousins has to go back one generation beyond their parents ( the grandparents ) before finding the most recent common ancestor and the other has to go back one or more they are first cousins .
If one had to go back two generations beyond the parents ( great grandparents ) and the other had to go back two or more they would be second cousins .
MULTIPLICITIES Section::::Multiplicities .
Double cousins arise when two siblings of one family mate with two siblings of another family .
This may also be referred to as ' cousins on both sides . '
The resulting children are related to each other through both of their parents and are thus doubly related .
Double first cousins share both sets of grandparents and have twice the degree of consanguinity of ordinary first cousins .
Half cousins are descended from half siblings .
The children of two half siblings are first half cousins .
If half siblings have children with another pair of half siblings , the resulting children would be double first half cousins .
GENDERED RELATIONSHIPS Section::::Gendered relationships .
A maternal cousin is a cousin that is related to the mother 's side of the family , while a paternal cousin is a cousin that is related to the father 's side of the family .
Unlike all the other cousin relationships discussed thus far , this relationship is not necessarily reciprocal , as the maternal cousin of one person could be the paternal cousin of the other .
Parallel and cross cousins on the other hand are reciprocal relationships .
Parallel cousins are descended from same - sex siblings .
Cousins that are related to same sex siblings of their most recent common ancestor are parallel cousins .
A parallel first cousin is either the paternal cousin on the father 's side of the family or the maternal cousin on the mother 's side of the family .
Cross cousins are descendants from opposite - sex siblings .
A cross first cousin is either the maternal cousin on the father 's side of the family or the paternal cousin on the mother 's side of the family .
NON - BLOOD RELATIONS Section::::Non - blood relations .
Stepcousins are either stepchildren of an individual 's aunt or uncle , nieces and nephews of one 's stepparent , or the children of one 's parent 's stepsibling .
Cousins in law are the cousins of a person 's spouse or the spouse of a person 's cousin .
Neither of these relationships have consanguinity .

A " table of consanguinity " , is helpful in identifying the degree of cousin relationship between two people using their most recent common ancestor as the reference point .
Cousinship between two people can be specifically described in degrees and removals by determining how close , generationally , the common ancestor is to each person .
Another visual chart used in determining the legal relationship between two people who share a common ancestor is a " canon law relationship chart " .
The chart is the same as the previous chart with the exception that the chart is symmetrical and has been rotated 45 Â° so that the common progenitor ( most recent common ancestor ) is placed at the peak .
Since the graph is symmetrical the placement of either party in the relationship on either side of the graph is arbitrary .
The graph does not distinguish between parents and children , or aunts / uncles and nieces / nephews .
For these non symmetrical relationships the relationship of the person from the most recent generation is displayed ( i.e. children and nieces / nephews ) .
COUSIN MARRIAGE Section::::Cousin marriage .
Cousin marriage is important in several anthropological theories which often differentiate between matriarchal and patriarchal parallel and cross cousins .
Currently about 10 % and historically as high as 80 % of all marriages are between first or second cousins .
Cousin marriages are often arranged .
Anthropologists believe it is used as a tool to strengthen the family , conserve its wealth , protect its cultural heritage , and retain the power structure of the family and its place in the community .
Some groups encourage cousin marriage while others attach a strong social stigma to it .
In some regions in the Middle East over half of all marriages are between first and second cousins .
In some of the countries in this region this may exceed 70 % .
Just outside this region it is often legal but infrequent .
In other places it is legally prohibited and culturally equivalent to incest .
Supporters of cousin marriage often view the prohibition as discrimination , while opponents cite the potential immorality .
GENETICS Section::::Genetics .
Married couples that possess higher than normal consanguinity , shared identical DNA and genetic material , have an increased chance of sharing genes for recessive traits .
The percentage of consanguinity between any two individuals decreases fourfold as the most recent common ancestor recedes one generation .
First cousins have four times the consanguinity of second cousins , while first cousins once removed have half that of first cousins .
Double first cousins share both sets of grandparents and have twice the degree of consanguinity of ordinary first cousins ; genetically , they are as related as half - siblings .
Children of these marriages may have an increased risk of genetic disorders , particularly if their parents both carry a harmful recessive mutation .
In a scenario where two monozygotic ( identical ) twins mate with another pair of monozygotic twins , the resulting double cousins would test as genetically similar as siblings .
Scientists through multiple studies have established a substantial and consistent positive correlation between the kinship of couples and the number of children and grandchildren they have .
The 2008 deCODE study results show that couples related at the level of third cousins have the greatest number of offspring , with the greatest reproductive success observed for couples related at the level of third and fourth cousins .
This study provides the most comprehensive answer yet to the longstanding question of how kinship affects fertility in humans .
The study result was somewhat counterintuitive from an evolutionary perspective because closely related parents have a higher probability of having offspring homozygous for deleterious recessive mutations , although closer parental kinship can also decrease the likelihood of immunological incompatibility between mother and offspring , for example in rhesus factor blood type .
The study confirmed that the offspring of first and second cousins died younger and reproduced less .
