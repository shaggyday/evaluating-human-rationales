BLACK SWAN ( FILM )
Black Swan is a 2010 American psychological horror film directed by Darren Aronofsky .
The screenplay was written by Mark Heyman , John McLaughlin , and Andres Heinz , based on an original story by Heinz .
The film stars Natalie Portman , Vincent Cassel , Mila Kunis , Barbara Hershey , and Winona Ryder .
The plot revolves around a production of Tchaikovsky 's Swan Lake ballet by the prestigious New York City Ballet company .
The production requires a ballerina to play the innocent and fragile White Swan , for which the committed dancer Nina ( Portman ) is a perfect fit , as well as the dark and sensual Black Swan , which are qualities better embodied by the new arrival Lily ( Kunis ) .
Nina is overwhelmed by a feeling of immense pressure when she finds herself competing for the part , causing her to lose her tenuous grip on reality and descend into a living nightmare .
Usually described as a psychological horror film , Black Swan can be also interpreted as a metaphor for achieving artistic perfection , with all the psychological and physical challenges one might encounter , i.e. " the film can be perceived as a poetic metaphor for the birth of an artist , that is , as a visual representation of Nina 's psychic odyssey toward achieving artistic perfection and of the price to be paid for it . "
Aronofsky conceived the premise by connecting his viewings of a production of Swan Lake with an unrealized screenplay about understudies and the notion of being haunted by a double , similar to the folklore surrounding doppelgängers .
Aronofsky cites Fyodor Dostoyevsky 's The Double as another inspiration for the film .
The director also considered Black Swan a companion piece to his 2008 film
The Wrestler , with both films involving demanding performances for different kinds of art .
He and Portman first discussed the project in 2000 , and after a brief attachment to Universal Studios , Black Swan was produced in New York City in 2009 by Fox Searchlight Pictures .
Portman and Kunis trained in ballet for several months prior to filming , and notable figures from the ballet world helped with film production to shape the ballet presentation .
The film premiered as the opening film for the 67th Venice International Film Festival on September 1 , 2010 .
It had a limited release in the United States starting December 3 , 2010 and opened in wide release on December 17 .
The film upon release was a critical and commercial success .
Critics praised Portman 's performance and Aronofsky 's direction , while the film grossed over $ 329 million worldwide .
It received five nominations at the 83rd Academy Awards : Best Picture , Best Director , Best Cinematography , Best Film Editing and winning Best Actress ( for Portman ) .
PLOT Section::::Plot .
Nina Sayers is a 28-year - old dancer in a New York City ballet company , which is preparing to open its new season with Tchaikovsky 's Swan Lake .
With prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre being forced into retirement , artistic director Thomas Leroy announces he is looking for a new dancer to portray the dual role of the innocent White Swan and the sensual Black Swan .
Nina auditions for the role and gives a flawless performance as the White Swan , but fails to embody the Black Swan .
The following day , Nina asks Thomas to reconsider choosing her to play the role .
When he forcibly kisses her , she bites him before running out of his office .
Later that day , Nina sees the cast list and discovers , much to her surprise and that of her overprotective mother Erica , she will be portraying the lead .
At a gala celebrating the new season , an intoxicated Beth confronts Nina , accusing her of sleeping with Thomas to get the role .
The following day , Nina discovers that Beth was hit by a car while walking in the street and Thomas believes she did it on purpose .
During rehearsals , Thomas tells Nina to observe new dancer Lily , whom he describes as possessing an uninhibited quality that Nina lacks .
Nina also falls victim to several hallucinations of a doppelgänger following her wherever she goes and finds unexplained scratch marks on her back .
One night , Nina accepts Lily 's invitation to dinner despite Erica 's objections .
Over dinner , Lily offers Nina an ecstasy capsule to help her relax .
Nina turns it down , but later accepts a drink laced with ecstasy powder .
The two dance at a nightclub and return to Nina 's apartment late .
After fighting with her mother , Nina barricades herself in her room and has sex with Lily .
The following morning , Nina wakes up alone and realizes she is late for the dress rehearsal .
Upon arriving at Lincoln Center , she finds Lily dancing as the Black Swan and confronts her about their night together .
When Lily does n't recall , Nina realizes that their encounter never took place .
After learning that Thomas has made Lily her alternate , Nina 's hallucinations grow increasingly stronger to the point where Erica tries to prevent her from performing on opening night .
Nina forces her way out of the apartment and arrives at Lincoln Center only to discover that Lily is set to take over .
She confronts Thomas , who becomes so impressed by her confidence that he allows her to perform .
During the end of the play 's second act , Nina becomes distracted by a hallucination , causing her partner to drop her .
She returns to her dressing room and finds Lily preparing to play the Black Swan .
When Lily transforms into Nina 's doppelgänger , the two engage in a fight that ends with Nina stabbing the doppelgänger with a shard of glass , only to reveal that it had actually been Lily who had been stabbed .
She hides the corpse and returns to the stage , where she loses herself and gives a flawless performance as the Black Swan .
Nina receives a standing ovation from the audience and , after surprising Thomas with a passionate kiss , returns to her dressing room .
While changing , Nina hears a knock at the door and opens it to find Lily alive and congratulating her .
Realizing the fight never occurred , and yet the mirror is still broken , and that she had stabbed herself , Nina quietly continues changing .
After dancing the final act , in which the White Swan attempts to commit suicide by throwing herself off a cliff but instead falls onto a hidden mattress , the theater erupts in thunderous applause and Thomas , Lily , and the cast gather to congratulate Nina .
They then discover that she is bleeding profusely .
Thomas orders some of the dancers to go get help and frantically asks Nina what she did .
Nina replies to him that her performance was perfect and loses consciousness as the screen slowly fades to white .

" Tom " / Suitor PRODUCTION CONCEPTION Section::::Production .
Section::::Conception .
Darren Aronofsky first became interested in ballet when his sister studied dance at the High School of Performing Arts in New York City .
The basic idea for the film started when he hired screenwriters to rework a screenplay called The Understudy , which portrayed off - Broadway actors and explored the notion of being haunted by a double .
Aronofsky said the screenplay had elements of All About Eve , Roman Polanski 's The Tenant , and Fyodor Dostoyevsky 's novella
The Double .
The director had also seen numerous productions of Swan Lake , and he connected the duality of the White Swan and the Black Swan to the script .
When researching for the production of Black Swan , Aronofsky found ballet to be " a very insular world " whose dancers were " not impressed by movies " .
Regardless , the director found active and inactive dancers to share their experiences with him .
He also stood backstage to see the Bolshoi Ballet perform at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts .
Aronofsky called Black Swan a companion piece to his previous film
The Wrestler , recalling one of his early projects about a love affair between a wrestler and a ballerina .
He eventually separated the wrestling and the ballet worlds as " too much for one movie " .
He compared the two films : " Wrestling some consider the lowest art — if they would even call it art — and ballet some people consider the highest art .
But what was amazing to me was how similar the performers in both of these worlds are .
They both make incredible use of their bodies to express themselves . "
About the psychological thriller nature of Black Swan , actress Natalie Portman compared the film 's tone to Polanski 's 1968 film Rosemary 's Baby , while Aronofsky said Polanski 's Repulsion ( 1965 ) and The Tenant ( 1976 ) were " big influences " on the final film .
Actor Vincent Cassel also compared Black Swan to Polanski 's early works and additionally compared it to David Cronenberg 's early works .
CASTING
Section::::Casting .
Aronofsky first discussed with Portman the possibility of a ballet film in 2000 , and he found she was interested in playing a ballet dancer .
Portman explained being part of Black Swan , " I 'm trying to find roles that demand more adulthood from me because you can get stuck in a very awful cute cycle as a woman in film , especially being such a small person .
"
Portman suggested to Aronofsky that her good friend Mila Kunis would be perfect for the role .
Kunis contrasted Lily with Nina , " My character is very loose ...
She 's not as technically good as Natalie 's character , but she has more passion , naturally .
That 's what [ Nina ] lacks .
" The female characters are directed in the Swan Lake production by Thomas Leroy , played by Cassel .
He compared his character to George Balanchine , who co - founded New York City Ballet and was " a control freak , a true artist using sexuality to direct his dancers " .
Portman and Kunis started training six months before the start of filming in order to attain a body type and muscle tone more similar to those of professional dancers .
Portman worked out for five hours a day , doing ballet , cross - training , and swimming .
A few months closer to filming , she began choreography training .
Kunis engaged in cardio and Pilates , " train[ing ] seven days a week , five hours , for five , six months total , and ... was put on a very strict diet of 1,200 calories a day . "
She lost 20 pounds from her normal weight of about 117 pounds , and reported that Portman " became smaller than I did . "
Kunis said , " I did ballet as a kid like every other kid does ballet .
You wear a tutu and you stand on stage and you look cute and twirl .
But this is very different because you ca n't fake it .
You ca n't just stay in there and like pretend
you know what you 're doing .
Your whole body has to be structured differently . "
Georgina Parkinson , a ballet mistress from the American Ballet Theatre ( ABT ) , coached the actors in ballet .
ABT soloists Sarah Lane and Maria Riccetto served as " dance doubles " for Portman and Kunis respectively .
Dancer Kimberly Prosa also served as a double for Portman .
She stated : " Natalie took class , she studied for several months , from the waist up is her .
Sarah Lane a soloist at ABT , did the heavy tricks , she did the fouettés , but they only had her for a limited time , a couple of weeks , so I did the rest of whatever dance shots they needed . "
In addition to the soloist performances , members of the Pennsylvania Ballet were cast as the corps de ballet , backdrop for the main actors ' performances .
Also appearing in the film are Kristina Anapau , Toby Hemingway , Sebastian Stan , and Janet Montgomery .
DEVELOPMENT AND FILMING Section::::Development and filming .
Aronofsky and Portman first discussed a ballet film in 2000 , after the release of Requiem for a Dream , though the script had not yet been written .
He told her about a love scene between competing ballet dancers , and Portman recalled , " I thought that was very interesting because this movie is in so many ways an exploration of an artist 's ego and that narcissistic sort of attraction to yourself and also repulsion with yourself . "
On the decade 's wait before production , she said , " The fact that I had spent so much time with the idea ... allowed it to marinate a little before we shot . "
The screenplay The Understudy was written by Andres Heinz ; Aronofsky first heard about it while editing his second film Requiem for a Dream ( 2000 ) and described it as " All About Eve with a double , set in the off - Broadway world . "
After making The Fountain ( 2006 ) , Aronofsky and producer Mike Medavoy had screenwriter John McLaughlin rewrite The Understudy ; Aronofsky said McLaughlin " took my idea of Swan Lake and the ballet and put [ the story ] into the ballet world and changed the title to Black Swan .
" When Aronofsky proposed a detailed outline of Black Swan to Universal Pictures , the studio decided to fast - track development of the project in January 2007 .
The project " sort of died , again " according to Aronofsky , until after the making of The Wrestler ( 2008 ) , when he had Mark Heyman , director of development of Aronofsky 's production company Protozoa Pictures , write for Black Swan " and made it something that was workable . "
By June 2009 , Universal had placed the project in turnaround , generating attention from other studios and specialty divisions , particularly with actress Portman attached to star .
Black Swan began development under Protozoa Pictures and Overnight Productions , the latter financing the film .
In July 2009 , Kunis was cast .
Fox Searchlight Pictures distributed Black Swan and gave the film a production budget of $ 10–12 million .
Principal photography was achieved using Super 16 mm cameras and began in New York City toward the end of 2009 .
Part of filming took place at the Performing Arts Center at State University of New York at Purchase .
Aronofsky filmed Black Swan with a muted palette and a grainy style , which he intended to be similar to The Wrestler .
Aronofsky said CONTROVERSIES Section::::Controversies .
Several critics noted striking similarities between Satoshi Kon 's 1997 anime film Perfect Blue and Aronofsky 's Black Swan .
Aronofsky had previously purchased the rights for a live - action remake of Perfect Blue , but the project never got off the ground , though it later influenced the bathtub scene in his 2000 film Requiem for a Dream .
In response to comparisons between Perfect Blue and Black Swan , Aronofsky acknowledged the similarities in 2010 , but denied that Black Swan was inspired by Perfect Blue .
Kon noted in his blog that he had met with Aronofsky in 2001 .
COSTUME DESIGN
Section::::Costume design .
Amy Westcott is credited as the costume designer and received several award nominations .
A publicized controversy arose regarding the question of who had designed 40 ballet costumes for Portman and the dancers .
An article in the British newspaper
The Independent suggested those costumes had actually been created by Rodarte 's Kate and Laura Mulleavy .
Westcott challenged that view and stated that in all only 7 costumes , among them the Black and White Swan , had been created in a collaboration between Rodarte , Westcott , and Aronofsky .
Furthermore , the corps ballet 's costumes were designed by Zack Brown ( for the American Ballet Theatre ) , and slightly adapted by Westcott and her costume design department .
Westcott said : " Controversy is too complimentary a word for two people using their considerable self - publicising resources to loudly complain about their credit once they realized how good the film is . " DANCE DOUBLE Section::::Dance double .
ABT dancer Sarah Lane served as a " dance double " for Portman in the film .
In a March 3 blog entry for Dance Magazine , editor - in - chief
Wendy Perron asked : " Do people really believe that it takes only one year to make a ballerina ?
We know that Natalie Portman studied ballet as a kid and had a year of intensive training for the film , but that does n't add up to being a ballerina .
However , it seems that many people believe that Portman did her own dancing in Black Swan .
"
This led to responses from Benjamin Millepied and Aronofsky , who both defended Portman , as well as a response from Lane claiming that she has not been given due credit .
SOUNDTRACK Section::::Soundtrack .
The non - original music featured in Black Swan consists of music by Tchaikovsky featuring performances on - screen and in the soundtrack by violinist Tim Fain and a track of electronica dance music by English production duo The Chemical Brothers .
It marks the fifth consecutive collaboration between Aronofsky and English composer Clint Mansell , who composed the original score for the film .
Mansell attempted to score the film based on Tchaikovsky 's ballet but with radical changes to the music .
Because of the use of Tchaikovsky 's music , the score was deemed ineligible to be entered into the 2010 Academy Awards for Best Original Score .
The Chemical Brothers ' music , which is featured prominently during the club scene in Black Swan , is omitted from the soundtrack album .

The website 's critical consensus reads ,
" Bracingly intense , passionate , and wildly melodramatic , Black Swan glides on Darren Aronofsky 's bold direction — and a bravura performance from Natalie Portman .
"
At Metacritic , which assigns a weighted average score out to reviews , the film received an average score of 79 out of 100 , based on 42 critics , indicating " generally favorable reviews " .
In September 2010 , Entertainment Weekly reported that based on reviews from the film 's screening at the Venice Film Festival , " [ Black Swan ] is already set to be one of the year 's most love - it - or - hate -
it movies . "
Leonard Maltin , on his blog Movie Crazy , admitted that he " could n't stand " the film , despite praising Natalie Portman 's performance .
Reuters described the early response to the film as " largely positive " with Portman 's performance being highly praised .
The Sydney Morning Herald reported that " the film divided critics .
Some found its theatricality maddening , but most declared themselves ' swept away ' . " Kurt Loder of Reason magazine called the film " wonderfully creepy " , and wrote that " it 's not entirely satisfying ; but it 's infused with the director 's usual creative brio , and it has a great dark gleaming look .
"
Mike Goodridge from Screen Daily called Black Swan " alternately disturbing and exhilarating " and described the film as a hybrid of The Turning Point and Polanski 's films Repulsion and Rosemary 's Baby .
Goodridge described Portman 's performance , " [ She ] is captivating as Nina ...
she captures the confusion of a repressed young woman thrown into a world of danger and temptation with frightening veracity .
"
The critic also commended Cassel , Kunis , and Hershey in their supporting roles , particularly comparing Hershey to Ruth Gordon in the role of " the desperate , jealous mother " .
Goodridge praised Libatique 's cinematography with the dance scenes and the psychologically " unnerving " scenes : " It 's a mesmerising psychological ride that builds to a gloriously theatrical tragic finale as Nina attempts to deliver the perfect performance . "
Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a mixed review .
He wrote , " [ Black Swan ] is an instant guilty pleasure , a gorgeously shot , visually complex film whose badness is what 's so good about it .
You might howl at the sheer audacity of mixing mental illness with the body - fatiguing , mind - numbing rigors of ballet , but its lurid imagery and a hellcat competition between two rival dancers is pretty irresistible .
" Honeycutt commended Millepied 's " sumptuous " choreography and Libatique 's " darting , weaving " camera work .
The critic said of the thematic mashup , " Aronofsky ... never succeeds in wedding genre elements to the world of ballet ...
White Swan / Black Swan dynamics almost work , but the horror - movie nonsense drags everything down the rabbit hole of preposterousness . "
Similarly , in a piece for The Huffington Post , Rob Kirkpatrick praised Portman 's performance but compared the film 's story to that of Showgirls ( 1995 ) and Burlesque ( 2010 ) while concluding Black Swan is " simply higher - priced cheese , Aronofsky 's camembert to [ Burlesque director Steve ]
Antin 's cheddar .
The film has been criticized for its portrayal of ballet and ballet dancers .
Upon the film 's release in the United Kingdom , The Guardian interviewed four professional ballet dancers in the UK :
Tamara Rojo , Lauren Cuthbertson , Edward Watson , and Elena Glurjidze .
Rojo called the film " lazy ... featuring every ballet cliche going . "
Watson felt that the film " makes [ ballet ] look so naff and laughable .
It does n't show why ballet is so important to us – why we would want to try so hard . "
The Canadian Press also reported that many Canadian ballet dancers felt that the film depicted dancers negatively and exaggerated elements of their lives but gave Portman high marks for her dance technique .
In an interview with the Los Angeles Times , Gillian Murphy a principal dancer with American Ballet Theatre praised the visual elements of the film but noted that the film presentation of the ballet world was " extreme . "
ACCOLADES Section::::Accolades .
Black Swan appeared on many critics ' top ten lists of 2010 and is frequently considered to be one of the best films of the year .
