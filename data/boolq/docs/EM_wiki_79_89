Danvers later became the first incarnation of Ms. Marvel in Ms. Marvel # 1 ( cover - dated January 1977 )
after her DNA was fused with Mar - Vell 's during an explosion , giving her superhuman powers .
Debuting in the Silver Age of comics , the character was featured in a self - titled series in the late 1970s before becoming associated with the superhero teams the Avengers and the X - Men .

PUBLICATION HISTORY 1960S Section::::Publication history .
Section::::1960s .
The character debuted in the title Marvel Super - Heroes as an officer in the United States Air Force and Security Chief of a restricted military base , where Danvers meets Dr. Walter Lawson , the human alias of alien Kree hero Captain Marvel .
In a later story , Danvers is caught in the explosion of a Kree device , after trying to get close to Captain Marvel .
Although Captain Marvel manages to save her life , Danvers sustains serious injuries .
1970S Section::::1970s .
Danvers resurfaces with superhuman abilities and becomes the hero Ms. Marvel in a self - titled series in January 1977 , at first written by Gerry Conway and later by Chris Claremont .
In the series , it is revealed that the energy exposure from the explosion of a device called the " Psyche - Magnetron " caused Danvers 's genetic structure to meld with Captain Marvel 's , effectively turning her into a human - Kree hybrid .
Ms. Marvel had a series of semi - regular appearances in The Avengers , with additional appearances with the Defenders , Spider - Man , the Thing , and Iron Man .
In one of these stories , the mutant terrorist Mystique kills Michael Barnett , Ms. Marvel 's lover .
At the time of the publication of Ms. Marvel # 1 in 1977 , the title was self - consciously socially progressive for its time .
This was reflected in the use of the word " Ms. " , then associated with the feminist movement , and in Danvers fighting for equal pay for equal work in her civilian identity .
1980S
Section::::1980s .
In The Avengers # 200 ( October 1980 ) , Ms. Marvel is kidnapped by a character named Marcus ( the apparent son of Avengers foe Immortus ) and taken to an alternate dimension , where she is brainwashed , seduced , and impregnated .
She gives birth on Earth to a child that rapidly ages into another version of Marcus , who is ultimately unable to remain on Earth after Hawkeye mistakenly damages his machine , takes Ms. Marvel back to the alternate dimension with no opposition from the Avengers , who perceive Ms. Marvel and Marcus to have fallen in love .
Comic book historian Carol A. Strickland criticized the storyline in an essay titled " The Rape of Ms. Marvel " .
Citing Marcus ' line , " Finally , after relative weeks of such efforts — and admittedly , with a subtle boost from Immortus ' machines — you became mine " , Strickland posited that this constituted rape .
As a former writer of the solo title , Chris Claremont also commented on the inappropriateness of the storyline .
Claremont effectively " undid " the Marcus story in Avengers Annual # 10 ( 1981 ) .
In that story , Danvers is revealed to have returned to Earth — courtesy of Immortus 's technology after Marcus continued to age and die of old age — but is attacked by the mutant Rogue , who permanently absorbs the character 's abilities and memories .
Danvers ' memories are restored by Professor X , and an angry confrontation with the Avengers concerning their failure to realize Marcus had brainwashed her follows .
Claremont continued to develop the character in the title Uncanny X - Men .
Danvers enters the Pentagon and , while wiping the government 's files on the X - Men , also deletes all records of herself in a symbolic break with her life as Ms. Marvel .
During an adventure in space with the X - Men , Danvers is changed courtesy of experimentation by the alien race the Brood into a newly empowered character called " Binary " .
Drawing on the power of a cosmic phenomenon called a white hole , Danvers becomes capable of generating the power of a star .
As Binary , the character has a number of encounters with the X - Men , New Mutants , and the British team Excalibur , as well as a solo adventure .
Claremont expanded on the incident with the character Rogue by having the Carol Danvers persona manifest itself within Rogue 's mind , sometimes overpowering Rogue 's personality .
This happens to Rogue on several occasions , which results in an uneasy armistice between the personalities within Rogue 's mind .
After Rogue passes through the ancient supernatural gateway called the Siege Perilous , the Ms. Marvel persona is separated from her as an independent entity .
Within the same issue , the Ms. Marvel persona is killed by Magneto .
1990S Section::::1990s .
The character continued to make sporadic appearances , and two additional issues planned for the original title — prevented by cancellation — were printed in a quarterly anthology series .
The same year the character was also used extensively in the storyline " Operation Galactic Storm " .
By the conclusion of the story , the character had lost her connection to the white hole she drew her powers from , reverting to the use of the original Ms. Marvel powers , but retaining the energy manipulation and absorption powers she had as Binary , albeit on a smaller scale .
After several more team and solo appearances the character then rejoins the Avengers with the new alias Warbird .
Writer Kurt Busiek explored the character by having her develop alcoholism , struggling to come to terms with the loss of her cosmic powers and memories .
Danvers disgraces herself during the " Live Kree or Die " storyline and is soon suspended from active duty .
After a brief appearance in Marvel 's alternate universe title
What If ? , the character was featured in Iron Man , Wolverine , and The Avengers before making a cameo appearance in Mutant X. 2000S Section::::2000s .
As Warbird , the character returns to the Avengers and plays a key role in the " Kang Dynasty " plotline .
Kang 's son Marcus , the Scarlet Centurion , falls in love with her , but she rejects him , in part because he reminds her of Marcus , son of Kang 's older alter ego Immortus , who raped her .
The Scarlet Centurion nonetheless helps her to defeat the Master of the World , a supervillain whose alien technology becomes the key to defeating Kang .
In the course of the fight , Warbird kills the Master , and after the final victory over Kang
she demands a court martial to review her actions .
The court martial finds her killing justified as an act of war , and Carol continues as an Avenger .
After the Avengers disband , Warbird leaves the group , and , along with other prominent former Avengers like Wasp , Hank Pym , Falcon and Wonder Man , is not included in the New Avengers group soon formed by Iron Man and Captain America .
The character was then featured as " Captain Marvel " in a false reality created by the mutant Scarlet Witch in the 2005 miniseries House of M.
This reality pandered to Danvers ' subconscious desire to be accepted , as she proved to be the most popular superhero on Earth .
Ms. Marvel then came to prominence again when the character was launched in a second self - titled volume .
Together with fellow Avenger Iron Man , Danvers also becomes a principal advocate of the Superhuman Registration Act during the events of the 2006 - 07 " Civil War " storyline .
The story also continues in Ms. Marvel 's own title as the character battles the anti - registration heroes led by Captain America .
The storyline has major consequences for the New Avengers , which debuts in the 2007 series The Mighty Avengers , with Danvers as a member .
Danvers enters into a relationship with fellow member Wonder Man , appears in a crossover series with the Transformers , and becomes leader of the Mighty Avengers .
The character makes an agreement with Tony Stark , director of S.H.I.E.L.D. , to lead a covert strike team called Operation :
Lightning Storm , its designated mission being the elimination of supervillains before they become global threats .
Ms. Marvel is captured by the Brood on Monster Island , whereupon she found the Brood Queen .
An intense confrontation ensued during which Ms. Marvel 's powers are temporarily disabled , forcing her to fight the Brood Queen as Carol Danvers .
At one point , she is stripped of her civilian clothing and was forced to drift through space until she was able to access her powers .
Ms. Marvel also plays a significant role in the 2008 storyline " Secret Invasion " , in which members of the shapeshifting alien race , the Skrulls , are revealed to have secretly infiltrated Earth by impersonating humans .
She befriends Captain Marvel 's Skrull impostor and proves to him that she is not a Skrull by revealing intimate details about their life together .
At the conclusion of the war with the Skrulls , Norman Osborn is placed in charge of the registered Avengers team .
Refusing to serve under Osborn , Ms. Marvel flees Avengers Tower , and joins the New Avengers , becoming second - in - command .
Osborn appoints former Thunderbolt member Moonstone ( Karla Sofen ) as the " new " Ms. Marvel to his Dark Avengers team ; Moonstone wears a variation of Ms. Marvel 's original costume .
Osborn engineers a battle that results in Danvers 's powers overloading , causing her apparent death .
The character Moonstone takes over the title role in the ongoing Ms. Marvel series .
Danvers returns with the aid of the New Avengers , a group of MODOK embryos ( creations of the organization
Advanced Idea Mechanics [ AIM ] ) , and a character known as the " Storyteller " and
reclaims the title of Ms. Marvel from Karla Sofen .
The increased use of Carol Danvers as a prominent character in many story arcs throughout this decade eventually prompted one commentator to note that " she 's now the House of Ideas ' premier heroine " .
2010S Section::::2010s .
In the conclusion of the second volume of Ms. Marvel , Carol Danvers battles her old nemesis Mystique and a clone of Captain Marvel created by the Skrulls during the Secret Invasion , after they carry out a series of tragedies at temples belonging to the Church of Hala , a church dedicated to Mar - Vell .
Danvers later aids the allied forces of Steve Rogers against Iron Patriot during the Siege of Asgard .
Danvers also begins to develop a friendship with Spider - Man .
Though he infuriates her the first time they work together , the two become closer when he helps her during the " Dark Reign " storyline , and she later admits to having feelings for him .
Following the conclusion of the " Siege " storyline , Ms. Marvel returns as a regular character in the second volume of The New Avengers .
In July 2012 , Carol Danvers assumed the mantle of Captain Marvel in an ongoing series written by Kelly Sue DeConnick with art by Dexter Soy .
Danvers dons a jumpsuit and explores her own past .
When describing her pitch for the series at WonderCon 2012 DeConnick said it could be " pretty much be summed up with ' Carol Danvers as Chuck Yeager . ' "
She said the series would contemplate what Captain Marvel 's legend means to Danvers , how she will wield it , and how the rest of the Marvel Universe reacts .
Danvers also rejoined the main Avengers team as Captain Marvel in vol .
5 of The Avengers and in the spin - off series , Avengers Assemble , also written by DeConnick .
Editor Lauren Sankovitch said that Marvel editors liked DeConnick 's work and that adding her to the team would " get some lady power in the Avengers lineup " .
DeConnick said , " You might know this -- I have a certain affection for [ Carol Danvers ] .
And I decided , ' Well , if I 'm deciding , there will be a slot available for her as well . ' "
In 2013 , Carol Danvers starred in the Captain Marvel / Avengers Assemble crossover storyline , " The Enemy Within " .
In the story , Danvers and her Avenger teammates battle Yon - Rogg , the Kree commander who was responsible for the explosion that caused Danvers to receive her powers , and in defeating the Kree Danvers loses her memories .
In November 2013 , Marvel announced that Danvers would be joining the Guardians of the Galaxy beginning in Free Comic Book Day : Guardians of the Galaxy ( May 2014 ) by Brian Michael Bendis and Sara Pichelli .
In March 2014 , Marvel launched an eighth volume of Captain Marvel written again by DeConnick and starring Danvers in the title role but drawn by artist David López .
DeConnick said , " The big difference is we were grounded in New York City for the previous volume ; at least in the latter part of it .
With the new Captain Marvel # 1 we start in NYC but after that we 're letting her go cosmic .
Carol will be spending time off planet . "
During the 2015 " Secret Wars " storyline , Danvers headlined her own tie - in series , Captain Marvel and the Carol Corps co - written by DeConnick and Kelly Thompson and drawn by López .
In the series , Danvers leads an elite squadron of female fighter pilots stationed at an airbase called Hala Field , where she is the only superpowered being ; this leads the corps to help Danvers answer questions about her origin , which puts her in conflict with the controlling forces of Battleworld .
During the storyline , Danvers becomes a member of A - Force , Battleworld 's all - female team of Avengers .
The series , written by G. Willow Wilson , continued into Marvel 's " All - New , All - Different Marvel " relaunch campaign that followed " Secret Wars , " with Danvers in a key role .
Continuing with the All - New , All - Different Marvel " initiative , Danvers starred in the ninth volume of Captain Marvel , written by Agent Carter showrunners Tara Butters and Michele Fazekas , with artwork by Kris Anka , which debuted in October 2015 .
The series , set eight months after " Secret Wars " , sees Danvers taking over the responsibilities of S.W.O.R.D. , the military agency that was previously designated to protect Earth from intergalactic threats .
Editor Sana Amanat said , " This is really meant to be the next level for Captain Marvel .
Carol is really meant to be a soldier and a commander , and also a diplomat .
We 're really trying to build up this space complex and this space world .
" At this time , Danvers also joined The Ultimates .
Series writer Al Ewing said , " Carol 's currently running Alpha Flight , which is Earth 's premier space agency .
[ She has ] seen the highs and the lows of the superhero business , and come out the other side .
Right now , Carol 's in the ascendant , culturally , both in - universe and outside it ...
Carol 's story in The Ultimates is very much about her links with the ordinary super - hero world , and about trying to form a bridge between that world and the world of The Ultimates . "
In 2016 , Danvers played a predominant role in the storyline " Civil War II " , the core miniseries of which was written by Brian Michael Bendis and illustrated by David Marquez .
In the story , Danvers is the leader of a faction of superheroes who wish to use Ulysses ' precognitive power to profile people who in his visions , will commit future crimes .
About her position Bendis stated , " From Carol 's point of view , she is like , ' You 're telling me the world is still turning at the end of the day and everyone is safe ?
I do n't care ...
If it keeps us safe , that 's fine . '
" Following the conclusion of " Civil War II " , Danvers starred in The Mighty Captain Marvel , by writer Margaret Stohl and artist Ramon Rosanas , which sees Danvers become a household name .
Stohl explained , " She will be one of the most popular heroes on the planet — but that 's not something she is very comfortable with .
And of course she 's lost a lot of folks that she 's loved so she has to cope with that , too .
That being said , she still has a job to do as commander of the Alpha Flight .
Her latest mission being recruiting and training new cadets .
It 'll also bring with it a mysterious danger that will threaten everything Carol has built . "
Beginning in July 2018 , Danvers headlined a limited series titled , The Life of Captain Marvel , by Stohl and artist Carlos Pacheco .
The series is described as a " retelling " of Danvers ' origin story but Stohl insisted that it is not a " reinvention " explaining , " You look through a different lens .
It 's nothing you 'll expect and nothing you 've seen happen but there will be parts of her life that change the context of what you 've seen before , so it 's telling the other side of the story , of how she came to be . "
Stohl also said that there will be similarities with the upcoming 2019 film , but the film is " its own thing . "
The series reveals that Danvers ' mother is Kree and that the blast that was responsible for her powers only awakened her preexisting Kree genes , and did not fuse her human DNA with Mar - Vell 's Kree DNA as originally written .
Danvers is scheduled to star in the tenth volume of Captain Marvel written by Thompson and drawn by Carmen Carnero .
The story sees Danvers return to New York City after a stint in space and reconnect with allies and friends like Iron Man and Spider - Woman , as well as explore new relationships .
Thompson teased , " There will definitely be some romance and it may be someone we all know and have seen before in Marvel Comics . " CHARACTERIZATION Section::::Characterization .
With Ms. Marvel # 1 in 1977 , writer Gerry Conway played a significant role in the character 's development , writing in his introduction to the series , " you might see a parallel between her quest for identity , and the modern woman 's quest for raised consciousness , for self - liberation , for identity " .
Ms. Marvel 's uniform and abilities , however , were derived from the character 's then - contemporary male counterpart : Captain Marvel .
The Ms. Marvel letters page ( " Ms . Prints " ) featured letters debating whether or not the character was feminist .
Reader ( and frequent letterhack )
Jana C. Hollingsworth took issue with Ms. Marvel 's entire origin : Another reader had issue with the character 's outfit :
" Question : where is a woman who wears long sleeves , gloves , high boots and a scarf ( winter wear ) , and at the same time has a bare back , belly , and legs ?
The Arctic equator ?
That costume requires a few alterations .
"
These questions , and the controversial rape in Avengers # 200 , caused many readers to question the character 's portrayal , and whether she was a good role model for female readers :
It has been noted that " Danvers ' initial appearances portrayed her as a strong character , but that changed over time — even after she gained super powers .
"
When Ms. Marvel received her own title in the 2000s , Marvel Comics was " determined to have the character take center stage in the Marvel Universe " , with " Joe Quesada and the other powers [ having ] had the character play major roles in their huge ' House of M ' crossover , in the ' New Avengers ' and in the gargantuan success that is ' Civil War ' . "
" Writer Brian Reed has had Ms. Marvel overcome worthy challenges ranging from alien invasions , time - traveling sorcerers and former teammates turned enemy . "
Brian Reed 's characterization of Ms. Marvel ( in the " War of the Marvels " story arc ) has been said to be " an engaging mix of bravado and aggression juxtaposed with compassion and empathy . "
The Carol Danvers incarnation of Ms. Marvel was the top - ranked female character ( at # 11 ) on IGN 's 2012 list of the " Top 50 Avengers .
" She is listed # 29 in Comics Buyer 's Guides " 100 Sexiest Women in Comics " .
POWERS AND ABILITIES Section::::Powers and abilities .
Carol Danvers initially possessed superhuman strength , endurance , stamina , flight , physical durability , a limited precognitive " sixth sense " , and a perfectly amalgamated human / Kree physiology that rendered her resistant to most toxins and poisons .
As Binary , the character could tap the energy of a " white hole " , allowing full control and manipulation of stellar energies , and therefore control over heat , the electromagnetic spectrum and gravity .
Light speed travel and the ability to survive in the vacuum of space were also possible .
Although the link to the white hole was eventually severed , Danvers retains her Binary powers on a smaller scale , enabling her to both absorb energy and project it in photonic form .
She can also still survive in space .
While she lacks a constant source of energy to maintain the abilities at their previous cosmic level , she can temporarily assume her Binary form if empowered with a high enough infusion of energy .
Danvers possesses superhuman strength and durability , can fly at roughly six times the speed of sound , retains her sixth sense , and can discharge explosive blasts of radiant energy , which she fires from her fingertips .
She also demonstrates the ability to absorb other forms of energy , such as electricity , to further magnify her strength and energy projection , up to the force of an exploding nuclear weapon .
When sufficiently augmented , she can withstand the pressure from a 92-ton weight , and strike with a similar level of force , although Hank Pym theorized that this likely was not her limit .
Danvers can not absorb magical energy without consequence , though she aided Dr. Stephen Strange in the defeat of the mystic menace Sir Warren Traveler .

No genuine explanation is given to how her powers came to exist in the Mangaverse ( though it is implied that she somehow gained them after exposure to attacks from the Rings of the Mandarin , as she claims she can feel the power of the Rings while climbing Mt. Fuji in the final issue of the series , indicating she followed them back to their present location on foot from the air base . ) , as she appears at first as a normal human , piloting what appears to be a variant design of an F-22 while assigned to the Yokota Air Force base and survives her plane being destroyed by agents of the Hand , as well as a number of direct attacks which leave her briefly hospitalized , only to awaken with her injuries more or less fully healed and exhibiting superhuman strength as she destroys a heart monitor and needle , then lifts up a bed one handed with no effort .
She further displays this enhanced strength when she cleaves Elektra in half with a single swing after climbing Mount Fuji with little real effort , making handholds on her own due to her new strength .
ULTIMATE
MARVEL Section::::Ultimate Marvel .
The Ultimate Marvel imprint features a version of the character without superhuman abilities named Captain Carol Danvers in the " Ultimate Galactus Trilogy " storyline .

In the title Ultimate Power , the character becomes acting director of S.H.I.E.L.D. after Nick Fury 's disappearance .
Her first missions involved working with the Fantastic Four and the X - Men opposing threats like Apocalypse , and the Silver Surfer .
In Ultimate Spider - Man , she works on apprehending Norman Osborn after he escapes from the Triskelion .
Things got difficult for her when Norman lied to the press that S.H.I.E.L.D. wrongly imprisoned him for trying to make the world a safer place , putting the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents out of a job .
She receives help from Spider - Man ( Peter Parker ) after she arrests him in public , hoping that it would lure Norman to her .
She summoned a press release and had Harry Osborn tell the reporters the truth that Norman was a horrible person for experimenting on himself and killing his mother .
Outraged , Norman went to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier and attacked his son along with her , Spider - Man , and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents on board .
Norman accidentally killed Harry and , feeling guilty , tells the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to kill him .

When Loki attempted another invasion of Earth , Danvers and the women of the team ( Zarda and Valkyrie ) were placed under a spell by Amora .
Danvers , using technology , was able to resist the spell and was able to free the rest of the team to battle Loki 's forces .
After Spider - Man was captured and replaced by the Chameleon , Danvers decided that having Peter , untrained , loose in the city was doing more harm than good .
She approached May Parker and they both agreed that Peter would attend training lessons from individual members of the New Ultimates .
Danvers and her New Ultimates battled Nick Fury and his Avengers while each side accused the other of being traitors to S.H.I.E.L.D. and the United States of America .
During the fight , Danvers was hit by a Police Cruiser , leaving her in critical condition .
