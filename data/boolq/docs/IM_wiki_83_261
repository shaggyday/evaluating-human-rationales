RECORD Section::::FIFA World Cup record .
Belgian 's first five appearances at the FIFA World Cup between 1930 and 1970 were not successful , as they failed to advance beyond the first round .
After two scoreless defeats at the inaugural World Cup in 1930 , Belgium scored their first two World Cup goals in 1934 against Germany , by virtue of Bernard Voorhoof .
However , both in 1934 and 1938 the Red Devils went out with a single loss .
In 1954 they held England at a tie ( 4–4 ) and in 1970 they achieved their first World Cup win , against El Salvador ( 3–0 ) .
Belgium reached six successive World Cups from 1982 through 2002 by playing qualification rounds , a record bettered only by Spain whose 2018 World Cup is their ninth consecutive qualification ( a streak going back to 1986 ) .
Every other nation with an equal or longer string of appearances has had the streak " interrupted " by automatic qualification as the host or the defending champion ( the 2006 tournament was the first for which the defending champion does not automatically qualify ) .
On top of that , in that era the Belgian team reached the second phase five out of six times .
Their fourth place finish in the 1986 was their best placement in their World Cup history , until 2018 when they finished third after beating England ( 2 - 0 ) in Saint Petersburg .

both goals scored by football icon Diego Maradona .

In the second round they lost to title defenders
Germany ( 3–2 ) .
During this last game , the Belgians were frustrated that Swiss referee Kurt Röthlisberger had not awarded them a penalty kick when German defender Thomas Helmer brought down their striker Josip Weber in the penalty area with a bump from behind .
After the match , Röthlisberger was sent home .
Michel Preud'homme was elected as best goalkeeper of the tournament .

301229−71 2002 FIFA WORLD CUP Section::::2002 FIFA World Cup .
With two ties , the 2002 FIFA World Cup did not start well for Belgium , but the team improved during the tournament .
Captain Marc Wilmots was notable for scoring in every match of the first round .
Belgium won the decisive group match against Russia with 3–2 and in the second round they had to play against eventual champions Brazil .
In this 1/8th final , referee Peter Prendergast disallowed a headed goal by Wilmots that would have given Belgium a 0–1 lead , after a " phantom foul " on Roque Júnior .
Eventually Brazil won 2–0 , but Brazilian coach Luiz Felipe Scolari admitted after this match that Belgium was a tough edge and after the tournament he declared that the match against the Red Devils had been the hardest for Brazil to win .
With the World Cup final still to go , the team did win the tournament 's fair - play award .
Marc Wilmots equalled the record of Enzo Scifo and Franky Van der Elst by appearing in 4 World Cup squads , although he did not play in his first World Cup in 1990 .
Wilmots also scored his 5th World Cup goal against Russia , which made him Belgium 's top scorer in World Cup Finals matches until the 2018 world cup when Romelu Lukaku also scored his 5th World Cup goal .
2014 FIFA WORLD CUP Section::::2014 FIFA World Cup .
In 2014 , Belgium started as group favourites and beat all group opponents with the smallest margin .
Thereafter , they played a round of 16 match against the United States in which American goalkeeper Tim Howard made 15 saves , crowning himself man of the match .
The Red Devils needed the extra time to proceed to the next stage ( 2–1 ) , where they faced Argentina .
In a balanced quarter - final against the Albiceleste , the World Cup ended for Belgium as they failed to equalize after Gonzalo Higuaín 's early goal .
