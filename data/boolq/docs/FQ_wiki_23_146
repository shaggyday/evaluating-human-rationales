VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS Verizon Communications Inc. ( ) ( ) is an American multinational telecommunications conglomerate and a corporate component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
The company is based at 1095 Avenue of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan , New York City , but is incorporated in Delaware .
In 1984 , the Justice Department of the United States mandated AT&T Corporation to break up the Bell System and split into seven companies , called " Baby Bells " .
One of the baby bells , Bell Atlantic , came into existence in 1984 consisting of the separate operating companies New Jersey Bell , Bell of Pennsylvania , Diamond State Telephone , and C&P Telephone , with a footprint from New Jersey to Virginia .
This company would later become Verizon .
As part of a rebranding of the Baby Bells in the mid-1990s , all of Bell Atlantic 's operating companies assumed the holding company 's name .
In 1997 , Bell Atlantic expanded into New York and the New England states by merging with fellow Baby Bell NYNEX .
Although Bell Atlantic was the surviving company name , the merged company moved its headquarters from Philadelphia to NYNEX 's old headquarters in New York City .
In 2000 , Bell Atlantic acquired GTE , which operated telecommunications companies across most of the rest of the country that was not already in Bell Atlantic 's footprint .
Bell Atlantic , the surviving entity , changed its name to " Verizon " , a portmanteau of ( Latin for " truth " ) and horizon .
In 2015 , Verizon expanded its business into content ownership by acquiring AOL , and two years later it acquired Yahoo ! .
AOL and Yahoo were amalgamated into a new division named Oath Inc. , Verizon is one of three remaining companies that had their roots in the former Baby Bells .
The other two , like Verizon , exist as a result of mergers among fellow former Baby Bell members .
SBC Communications , bought out the Bells ' former parent AT&T Corporation , and assumed the AT&T name .
CenturyLink was formed initially in 2011 by the acquisition of Qwest ( formerly named US West ) .
Verizon 's subsidiary Verizon Wireless is the largest U.S. wireless communications service provider , with 147 million mobile customers .
And as of 2017 , Verizon is the only publicly - traded telecommunications company to have two stock listings in its home country , both the NYSE ( principal ) and NASDAQ ( secondary ) .
As of 2017 , it is also the second largest telecommunications company by revenue after AT&T. HISTORY BELL ATLANTIC ( 1983–2000 ) Section::::History .
Section::::Bell Atlantic ( 1983–2000 ) .
Bell Atlantic Corporation was created as one of the original Regional Bell Operating Companies ( RBOCs ) in 1984 , during the breakup of the Bell System .
Bell Atlantic 's original roster of operating companies included : * The Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania
* New Jersey Bell * Diamond State Telephone * C&P Telephone ( itself comprising four subsidiaries ) Bell Atlantic originally operated in the states of New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Delaware , Maryland , West Virginia , and Virginia , as well as Washington , DC .
In 1996 , CEO and Chairman Raymond W. Smith orchestrated Bell Atlantic 's merger with NYNEX .
When it merged , it moved its corporate headquarters from Philadelphia to New York City .
NYNEX was consolidated into this name by 1997 .
ACQUISITION OF GTE ( 2000–2002 ) Section::::Acquisition of GTE ( 2000–2002 ) .
Bell Atlantic changed its name to Verizon Communications in June 2000 when the Federal Communications Commission approved a US$ 64.7 billion acquisition of telephone company GTE , nearly two years after the deal was proposed in July 1998 .
The approval came with 25 stipulations to preserve competition between local phone carriers , including investing in new markets and broadband technologies .
The new entity was headed by co - CEOs Charles Lee , formerly the CEO of GTE , and Bell Atlantic CEO Ivan Seidenberg .
Upon the acquisition , Verizon became the largest local telephone company in the United States , operating 63 million telephone lines in 40 states .
The company also inherited 25 million mobile phone customers .
Additionally , Verizon offered internet services and long - distance calling in New York , before expanding long - distance operations to other states .
The name Verizon derives from the combination of the words , Latin for truth , and horizon .
The name was chosen from 8,500 candidates and the company spent $ 300 million on marketing the new brand .
Two months before the FCC gave final approval on the formation of Verizon Communications , Bell Atlantic formed Verizon Wireless in a joint venture with the British telecommunications company Vodafone in April 2000 .
The companies established Verizon Wireless as its own business operated by Bell Atlantic , which owned 55 % of the venture .
Vodafone retained 45 % of the company .
The deal was valued at approximately $ 70 billion and created a mobile carrier with 23 million customers .
Verizon Wireless merged Bell Atlantic 's wireless network , Vodafone 's AirTouch and PrimeCo holdings , and the wireless division of GTE .
Due to its size , Verizon Wireless was able to offer national coverage at competitive rates , giving it an advantage over regional providers typical of the time .
During its first operational year , Verizon Wireless released Mobile Web , an Internet service that allowed customers to access partner sites such as E*Trade , ABC News , ESPN , Amazon.com , Ticketmaster and MSN , as well as the " New Every Two " program , which gave customers a free phone with every two - year service contract .
In another partnership with MSN in 2002 , Verizon Wireless launched the mobile content service " VZW with MSN " and a phone that utilized the Microsoft Windows operating system .
In August 2000 , approximately 85,000 Verizon workers went on an 18-day labor strike after their union contracts expired .
The strike affected quarterly revenues , resulting in Verizon Wireless ' postponement of the company 's IPO ( the IPO was ultimately cancelled in 2003 , because the company no longer needed to raise revenue for Verizon Wireless due to increased profits ) , and created a backlog of repairs .
Verizon launched 3 G service in 2002 , which doubled the Internet speeds of the time to 144 kb a second .
In August 2002 , Verizon began offering local , long - distance , and mobile calling , as well as Internet service , in a bundle .
It was initially only available to customers in New York and Massachusetts .
2003–2005
Section::::2003–2005 .

Verizon replaced telecom competitor AT&T , which had been a part of the index since the Great Depression .

The acquisition gave the company access to MCI 's one million corporate clients and international holdings , expanding Verizon 's presence into global markets .
As a result , Verizon Business was established as a new division to serve the company 's business and government customers .
The FCC approved the deal on November 5 , 2005 , valuing it at $ 8.5 billion .

Protesters staged the National Day of Out(R)age due in part to the controversy .

Vonage later lost an appeal and was ordered to pay Verizon $ 120 million .

Verizon Wireless reversed a controversial decision in September 2007 to deny NARAL Pro - Choice America a short code through which the organization could text consumers who had signed up for messaging from the group .
They had initially refused the group access to a code by reserving the right to block " controversial or unsavory " messages .
In November 2007 , Verizon opened its networks for the first time to third party apps and devices , a decision that allowed it to participate in the FCC 's 2008 700 MHz auction of " open access " spectrum .

Verizon utilized the increased spectrum for its 4 G service .

The company stated the overcharges were accidental and only amounted to a few dollars per customer .
On February 4 , 2010 , 4chan started receiving reports from Verizon Wireless customers that they were having difficulties accessing the site 's image boards .
4chan administrators found that only traffic on port 80 to the boards.4chan.org domain was affected , leading them to believe that the block was intentional .
On February 7 , 2010 , Verizon Wireless confirmed that 4chan.org was " explicitly blocked " after Verizon 's security and external experts detected sweep attacks coming from an IP address associated with the 4chan network .
Traffic was restored several days later .
In August 2010 , the chairmen of Verizon and Google agreed that network neutrality should be defined and limited .
