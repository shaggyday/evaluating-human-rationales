PLOT Section::::Plot .
Holden Caulfield , a teenager , is living in an unspecified institution in Southern California near Hollywood in 1951 .
Caulfield intends to live with his brother D.B , an author and World War II veteran with whom Holden is angry for becoming a screenwriter , one month after his discharge .
As he waits , Holden recalls the events of the previous Christmas .
Holden begins his story at Pencey Preparatory Academy , an exclusive boarding school in Agerstown , Pennsylvania , on the Saturday afternoon of the traditional football game with a rival school .
Holden has been expelled from Pencey due to poor work and is not to return after Christmas break , which begins the following Wednesday .
He plans to return home on that day so that he will not be present when his parents receive notice of his expulsion .
After forfeiting a fencing match in New York by forgetting the equipment in the subway , he is invited to the home of his history teacher , Mr. Spencer .
Spencer is a well - meaning but long - winded old man .
Spencer greets him and offers him advice , but embarrasses Holden by further criticizing Holden 's work in his subject in a rude manner .
Holden returns to his dorm wearing the new red hunting cap he bought in New York .
His dorm neighbor Robert Ackley is one of the few students also missing the game .
Ackley , unpopular among his peers , disturbs Holden with his impolite questioning and mannerisms .
Holden , who feels sorry for Ackley , tolerates his presence .
Later , Holden agrees to write an English composition for his roommate , Ward Stradlater , who is leaving for a date .
However , Holden is distressed to learn that Stradlater 's date is an old friend , Jane Gallagher , whom Holden had romantic feelings for and feels protective of .
That night , Holden decides to go to a Cary Grant comedy with his best friend Mal Brossard and Ackley .
Since Ackley and Mal had already seen the film , they end up just playing pinball and returning to Pencey .
When Stradlater returns hours later , he fails to appreciate the deeply personal composition Holden wrote for him about the baseball glove of Holden 's late brother Allie , and refuses to reveal whether he slept with Jane .
Enraged , Holden punches him , and Stradlater easily wins the ensuing fight .
When Holden continues insulting him after the fight , Stradlater knocks him unconscious and leaves him with a bloody nose .
After leaving for Ackley 's room , Holden is disappointed when he treats him rudely .
Fed up with the so - called " phonies " at Pencey Prep , Holden impulsively decides to leave Pencey early , sells his typewriter to earn money , and catches a train to Penn Station in New York .
Holden intends to stay away from his home in a hotel until Wednesday , when his parents would have received news of his expulsion .
Aboard the train , Holden meets the mother of a wealthy , obnoxious Pencey student named Ernest Morrow , and lies to her about himself and her son .
In a taxicab , Holden inquires with the driver about whether the ducks in the Central Park lagoon migrate during winter , a subject he brings up often , but the man barely responds .
Holden checks into the dilapidated Edmont Hotel .
He spends an evening dancing with three tourist women from Seattle in the hotel lounge and enjoys dancing with one , though is disappointed that he is unable to hold a conversation with them .
Following an unpromising visit to Ernie 's Nightclub in Greenwich Village , Holden becomes preoccupied with his internal angst and agrees to have a prostitute named Sunny visit his room .
His attitude toward the girl changes the minute she enters the room ; she seems about the same age as him .
Holden becomes uncomfortable with the situation , and when he tells her all he wants to do is talk , she becomes annoyed and leaves .
Even though he still paid her the right amount for her time , she returns with her pimp Maurice and demands more money .
Holden insults Maurice , and after Sunny takes the money from Holden 's wallet , Maurice punches him in the stomach and leaves with Sunny .
Afterwards , Holden imagines that he has been shot by Maurice , and pictures murdering him with an automatic pistol .
The next morning , Holden , becoming increasingly depressed and in need of personal connection , calls Sally Hayes , a familiar date .
Although Holden claims that she is " the queen of all phonies " , they agree to meet that afternoon to attend a play at the Biltmore Theater .
Holden shops for a special record , " Little Shirley Beans " , for his 10-year - old sister Phoebe .
He spots a small boy singing " If a body catch a body coming through the rye " , which lifts his mood .
Although Holden 's date initially goes well , it soon sours after Sally introduces her friend George .
After the play , Holden and Sally go ice skating at Rockefeller Center , where Holden suddenly begins ranting against society and frightens Sally .
He impulsively invites Sally to run away with him that night to live in the wilderness of New England , but she is uninterested in his hastily conceived plan and declines .
The conversation turns sour , and the two angrily part ways .
Holden decides to meet his old classmate , a Columbia student named Carl Luce , for drinks at the Wicker Bar in the Seton Hotel .
During the meeting , Holden annoys Carl with his fixation on sex .
After Luce leaves , Holden gets drunk , awkwardly flirts with several adults , and calls an icy Sally .
Exhausted and out of money , Holden wanders over to Central Park to investigate the ducks , breaking Phoebe 's record on the way .
Nostalgically recalling his experience in elementary school and the unchanging dioramas in the Museum of Natural History that he enjoyed visiting as a child , Holden heads home to see Phoebe .
He sneaks into his parents ' apartment while they are out , and wakes up Phoebe – the only person with whom he seems to be able to communicate his true feelings .
Although Phoebe is happy to see Holden , she quickly deduces that he has been expelled , and chastises him for his aimlessness and his apparent dislikes towards everything .
When asked if he cares about anything , Holden shares a selfless fantasy he has been thinking about ( based on a mishearing of Robert Burns 's Comin ' Through the Rye ) : he pictures himself as the sole guardian of thousands of children playing in a huge rye field on the edge of a cliff .
His job is to catch the children if , in their abandon , they come close to falling off the brink ; to be , in effect , the " catcher in the rye " .
Because of this misinterpretation , Holden believes that to be the " catcher in the rye " means to save children from losing their innocence .
When his mother returns home , Holden slips out and visits his former and much - admired English teacher , Mr. Antolini , who is now a New York University professor .
Mr. Antolini expresses concern that Holden is headed for " a terrible fall " and advises him to begin applying himself .
Although Holden is exhausted , he is courteous and considers his advice .
Mr. Antolini also provides Holden with a place to sleep .
Holden is upset when he wakes up in the night to find Mr. Antolini patting his head , which he interprets as a homosexual advance .
Confused and uncertain , he leaves and spends the rest of the night in a waiting room at Grand Central Station , where he sinks further into despair and expresses regret over leaving Mr. Antolini .
He spends most of Monday morning wandering Fifth Avenue .
Losing hope of finding belonging or companionship in the city , Holden impulsively decides that he will head out west and live a reclusive lifestyle as a gas station attendant .
He decides to see Phoebe at lunchtime to explain his plan and say farewell .
While visiting Phoebe 's school to give a forged excuse note , Holden becomes quite annoyed by graffiti containing the word " fuck " , and becomes distressed by the thought of children learning the word 's meaning .
When he meets Phoebe at the Metropolitan Museum of Art , she arrives with a suitcase and asks to go with him , even though she was looking forward to acting as Benedict Arnold in a play that Friday .
Holden refuses to let her come with him , which upsets Phoebe , so Holden decides not to leave after all .
He tries to cheer her up by allowing her to skip school and taking her to the Central Park Zoo , but she remains angry with him .
They eventually reach the zoo 's carousel , where Phoebe reconciles with Holden after he buys her a ticket .
Holden is finally filled with happiness and joy at the sight of Phoebe riding in the rain .
In a short epilogue , Holden briefly alludes to encountering his parents that night and " getting sick " ( implying a tuberculosis diagnosis ) , mentioning that he will be attending another school in September .
Holden says that he does n't want to tell anything more because , surprisingly , he has found himself missing his former classmates .
He warns the reader that telling others about their own experiences will lead them to miss the people who shared them .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Various older stories by Salinger contain characters similar to those in The Catcher in the Rye .
While at Columbia University , Salinger wrote a short story called " The Young Folks " in Whit Burnett 's class ; one character from this story has been described as a " thinly penciled prototype of Sally Hayes " .
In November 1941 he sold the story " Slight Rebellion off Madison " , which featured Holden Caulfield , to The New Yorker , but it was n't published until December 21 , 1946 , due to World War II .
The story " I 'm Crazy " , which was published in the December 22 , 1945 , issue of Collier 's , contained material that was later used in The Catcher in the Rye .
In 1946 , The New Yorker accepted a 90-page manuscript about Holden Caulfield for publication , but Salinger later withdrew it .
WRITING STYLE
Section::::Writing style .
The Catcher in the Rye is narrated in a subjective style from the point of view of Holden Caulfield , following his exact thought processes .
There is flow in the seemingly disjointed ideas and episodes ; for example , as Holden sits in a chair in his dorm , minor events , such as picking up a book or looking at a table , unfold into discussions about experiences .
Critical reviews affirm that the novel accurately reflected the teenage colloquial speech of the time .
Words and phrases that appear frequently include : * " Old " – term of familiarity or endearment .
* " Phony " – superficially acting a certain way only to change others ' perceptions *
" That killed me " – one found that hilarious or astonishing * " Flit " – homosexual * " Crumbum " or " crumby " – inadequate , insufficient , disappointing
* " Snowing " – sweet - talking *
" I got a bang out of that " – one found it hilarious or exciting *
" Shoot the bull " – have a conversation containing false elements *
" Give her the time " – sexual intercourse
* " Necking " – kissing *
" Chew the fat " or " chew the rag " – small - talk
* " Rubbering " or " rubbernecks " – idle onlooking / onlookers *
" The Can " – the bathroom * " Prince of a guy " - fine fellow .
However often used sarcastically * " Prostitute " - sellout of phony .
eg .
in regards to his brother D.B. who is a writer : " Now he 's out in Hollywood being a prostitute " INTERPRETATIONS Section::::Interpretations .
Bruce Brooks held that Holden 's attitude remains unchanged at story 's end , implying no maturation , thus differentiating the novel from young adult fiction .
In contrast , Louis Menand thought that teachers assign the novel because of the optimistic ending , to teach adolescent readers that " alienation is just a phase . "
While Brooks maintained that Holden acts his age , Menand claimed that Holden thinks as an adult , given his ability to accurately perceive people and their motives .
Others highlight the dilemma of Holden 's state , in between adolescence and adulthood .
Holden is quick to become emotional .
" I felt sorry as hell for ... " is a phrase he often uses .
It is often said that Holden changes at the end , when he watches Phoebe on the carousel , and he talks about the golden ring and how it 's good for kids to try and grab it .
Peter Beidler , in his A Reader 's Companion to J. D. Salinger 's " The Catcher in the Rye " , identifies the movie that the prostitute " Sunny " refers to .
In chapter 13 she says that in the movie a boy falls off a boat .
The movie is Captains Courageous ( 1937 ) , starring Spencer Tracy .
Sunny says that Holden looks like the boy who fell off the boat .
Beidler shows ( page 28 )
a still of the boy , played by child - actor Freddie Bartholomew .
Each Caulfield child has literary talent .
D.B. writes screenplays in Hollywood ; Holden also reveres D.B. for his writing skill ( Holden 's own best subject ) , but he also despises Hollywood industry - based movies , considering them the ultimate in " phony " as the writer has no space for his own imagination , and describes D.B. 's move to Hollywood to write for films as " prostituting himself " ; Allie wrote poetry on his baseball glove ; and Phoebe is a diarist .
This " catcher in the rye " is an analogy for Holden , who admires in children attributes that he struggles to find in adults , like innocence , kindness , spontaneity , and generosity .
Falling off the cliff could be a progression into the adult world that surrounds him and that he strongly criticizes .
Later , Phoebe and Holden exchange roles as the " catcher " and the " fallen " ; he gives her his hunting hat , the catcher 's symbol , and becomes the fallen as Phoebe becomes the catcher .
In their biography of Salinger , David Shields and Shane Salerno argue that : " The Catcher in the Rye can best be understood as a disguised war novel .
" Salinger witnessed the horrors of World War II , but rather than writing a combat novel , Salinger , according to Shields and Salerno , " took the trauma of war and embedded it within what looked to the naked eye like a coming - of - age novel . " RECEPTION Section::::Reception .
The Catcher in the Rye has been listed as one of the best novels of the twentieth century .
Shortly after its publication , writing for The New York Times , Nash K. Burger called it " an unusually brilliant novel , " while James Stern wrote an admiring review of the book in a voice imitating Holden 's .
George H. W. Bush called it a " marvelous book , " listing it among the books that have inspired him .
In June 2009 , the BBC 's Finlo Rohrer wrote that , 58 years since publication , the book is still regarded " as the defining work on what it is like to be a teenager .
Holden is at various times disaffected , disgruntled , alienated , isolated , directionless , and sarcastic . "
Adam Gopnik considers it one of the " three perfect books " in American literature , along with Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Great Gatsby , and believes that " no book has ever captured a city better than Catcher in the Rye captured New York in the fifties . "
Jeff Pruchnic wrote an appraisal of The Catcher in the Rye after the death of J.D. Salinger .
In this article , Pruchnic focuses on how the novel continues to be received incredibly well , even after it has aged many generations .
Pruchnic describes Holden as a " teenage protagonist frozen midcentury but destined to be discovered by those of a similar age in every generation to come " .
Bill Gates said that The Catcher in the Rye is one of his favorite books ever .
However , not all reception has been positive ; the book has had its share of critics .
Rohrer writes , " Many of these readers are disappointed that the novel fails to meet the expectations generated by the mystique it is shrouded in .
J. D. Salinger has done his part to enhance this mystique .
That is to say , he has done nothing .
" Rohrer assessed the reasons behind both the popularity and criticism of the book , saying that it " captures existential teenage angst " and has a " complex central character " and " accessible conversational style " ; while at the same time some readers may dislike the " use of 1940s New York vernacular " and other things . CENSORSHIP AND USE IN SCHOOLS Section::::Censorship and use in schools .
In 1960 , a teacher in Tulsa , Oklahoma was fired for assigning the novel in class ; however , she was later reinstated .
Between 1961 and 1982 , The Catcher in the Rye was the most censored book in high schools and libraries in the United States .
The book was banned in the Issaquah , Washington high schools in 1978 as being part of an " overall communist plot " .
In 1981 , it was both the most censored book and the second most taught book in public schools in the United States .
According to the American Library Association , The Catcher in the Rye was the 10th most frequently challenged book from 1990 to 1999 .
It was one of the ten most challenged books of 2005 , and although it had been off the list for three years , it reappeared in the list of most challenged books of 2009 .
The challenges generally begin with Holden 's frequent use of vulgar language , with other reasons including sexual references , blasphemy , undermining of family values and moral codes , encouragement of rebellion , and promotion of drinking , smoking , lying , promiscuity , and sexual abuse .
Often the challengers have been unfamiliar with the plot itself .
Shelley Keller - Gage , a high school teacher who faced objections after assigning the novel in her class , noted that " the challengers are being just like Holden ...
They are trying to be catchers in the rye " .
A Streisand effect has been that this incident caused people to put themselves on the waiting list to borrow the novel , when there was no waiting list before .
VIOLENT REACTIONS
Section::::Violent reactions .
Several shootings have been associated with Salinger 's novel , including Robert John Bardo 's murder of Rebecca Schaeffer and John Hinckley Jr. 's assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan .
Additionally , after fatally shooting John Lennon , Mark David Chapman was arrested with a copy of the book that he had purchased that same day , inside of which he had written : " To Holden Caulfield , From Holden Caulfield , This is my statement " .
ATTEMPTED ADAPTATIONS
IN FILM Section::::Attempted adaptations .
Section::::In film .
Early in his career , Salinger expressed a willingness to have his work adapted for the screen .
In 1949 , a critically panned film version of his short story " Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut " was released ; renamed My Foolish Heart , the film took great liberties with Salinger 's plot and is widely considered to be among the reasons that Salinger refused to allow any subsequent film adaptations of his work .
The enduring popularity of The Catcher in the Rye , however , has resulted in repeated attempts to secure the novel 's screen rights .
When The Catcher in the Rye was first released , many offers were made to adapt it for the screen , including one from Samuel Goldwyn , producer of My Foolish Heart .
In a letter written in the early 1950s , Salinger spoke of mounting a play in which he would play the role of Holden Caulfield opposite Margaret O'Brien , and , if he could n't play the part himself , to " forget about it . "
Almost 50 years later , the writer Joyce Maynard definitively concluded , " The only person who might ever have played Holden Caulfield would have been J. D. Salinger . "
Salinger told Maynard in the 1970s that Jerry Lewis " tried for years to get his hands on the part of Holden , " despite Lewis not having read the novel until he was in his thirties .
Celebrities ranging from Marlon Brando and Jack Nicholson to Tobey Maguire and Leonardo DiCaprio have since tried to make a film adaptation .
In an interview with Premiere , John Cusack commented that his one regret about turning 21 was that he had become too old to play Holden Caulfield .
Writer - director Billy Wilder recounted his abortive attempts to snare the novel 's rights :
In 1961 , Salinger denied Elia Kazan permission to direct a stage adaptation of Catcher for Broadway .
More recently , Salinger 's agents received bids for the Catcher film rights from Harvey Weinstein and Steven Spielberg , neither of which was even passed on to Salinger for consideration .
In 2003 , the BBC television program The Big Read featured The Catcher in the Rye , interspersing discussions of the novel with " a series of short films that featured an actor playing J. D. Salinger 's adolescent antihero , Holden Caulfield .
"
The show defended its unlicensed adaptation of the novel by claiming to be a " literary review " , and no major charges were filed .
After Salinger 's death in 2010 , Phyllis Westberg , who was Salinger 's agent at Harold Ober Associates , stated that nothing has changed in terms of licensing film , television , or stage rights of his works .
A letter written by Salinger in 1957 revealed that he was open to an adaptation of The Catcher in the Rye released after his death .
He wrote : " Firstly , it is possible that one day the rights will be sold .
Since there 's an ever - looming possibility that I wo n't die rich , I toy very seriously with the idea of leaving the unsold rights to my wife and daughter as a kind of insurance policy .
It pleasures me no end , though , I might quickly add , to know that I wo n't have to see the results of the transaction .
" Salinger also wrote that he believed his novel was not suitable for film treatment , and that translating Holden Caulfield 's first - person narrative into voice - over and dialogue would be contrived .
BANNED FAN FICTION
Section::::Banned fan fiction .
In 2009 , a year before his death , Salinger successfully sued to stop the U.S. publication of a novel that presents Holden Caulfield as an old man .
The novel 's author , Fredrik Colting , commented : " call me an ignorant Swede , but the last thing I thought possible in the U.S. was that you banned books " .
The issue is complicated by the nature of Colting 's book , 60 Years Later : Coming Through the Rye , which has been compared to fan fiction .
Although commonly not authorized by writers , no legal action is usually taken against fan fiction , since it is rarely published commercially and thus involves no profit .
Colting , however , has published his book commercially , therefore interfering with copyright law and is not protected .
LEGACY Section::::Legacy .
The Catcher in the Rye has had significant cultural influence , and works inspired by the novel have been said to form their own genre .
Sarah Graham assessed works influenced by The Catcher in the Rye to include the novels Less Than Zero by Bret Easton Ellis , The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky , A Complicated Kindness by Miriam Toews , The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath , Ordinary People by Judith Guest , and the film Igby Goes Down by Burr Steers .
Fantasy writer Harry Turtledove has written a pastiche - parody " Catcher in the Rhine " , based on his daughter 's mishearing of Salinger 's title .
In this short story , an unnamed narrator , who is clearly meant to be Holden Caulfield but is unnamed to avoid copyright problems , goes on vacation to Germany and meets characters from the Niebelunglied .
This was first published in The Chick is in the Mail , edited by Esther Friesner , Baen 2000 and reprinted in the omnibus Chicks Ahoy !
( 2010 ) .
It was reprinted in Atlantis and Other Places also in 2010 .
In " Catcher In The Wry " former major league baseball player , Bob Uecker , recounts anecdotes of his years behind the plate and on the road , recalling the antics of his famous teammates , including Hank Aaron , Bob Gibson , Richie Allen , and Warren Spahn .
The July 1985 issue of National Lampoon included a parody of the novel , ostensibly written by Holden Caulfield 's son , entitled ' The Son of the Catcher , who Lives in Rye ' .
In Postal 2 a book by the name of " Catch her in the Rye " is present .
In December 1991 , punk rock band Green Day released their second studio album ( Kerplunk ) , containing the song Who Wrote Holden Caulfield .
The song describes said character as crazy , frustrated , and lacking motivation .
Guns and Roses album Chinese Democracy includes a song called Catcher in the Rye in which the narrator debates a violent fantasy .
" The Catcher in the Rye " deeply influenced the 2017 biographical drama film , " Rebel in the Rye " , which is about J.D. Salinger .
It is a visual about his life , before and after World War II , and gives more about the author 's life than the readers of " The Catcher in the Rye " learned from the novel .
