CHAMPS - ÉLYSÉES STAGE IN THE TOUR DE FRANCE
The Tour de France has finished on the Champs - Élysées every year since 1975 .
In the first edition of 1903 , the finish was at Ville - d'Avray ; from 1904 to 1967 at the Parc des Princes and from 1968 to 1974 at the Vélodrome de Vincennes .
The course is also used for La Course by Le Tour de France , a women 's one - day race held since 2014 .
HISTORY Section::::History .
In the first Tour of 1903 , the finish was at Ville - d'Avray .
From 1904 to 1967 it was at the Parc des Princes track and from 1968 to 1974 , during the heyday of Eddy Merckx , at the Vélodrome de Vincennes .
In 1974 , Félix Lévitan , co - director of the Tour , and reporter Yves Mourousi suggested a finish on the Champs - Élysées .
Mourousi directly contacted French President Valéry Giscard
d'Estaing to obtain permission .
The first stage took place in 1975 : this was a Paris - Paris stage of 25 laps ( 163.5 km ) .
The Belgian Walter Godefroot won the sprint and Bernard Thévenet received the yellow jersey from the hands of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing .
In 1977 , French Alain Meslet became the first rider to win alone .
Since 1978 , the Tour launched from outside the city , only the end of the stage follows the route , and the number of laps has varied between six and eight , except for 2003 , when the Tour commemorated the centenary of the event ; 2013 , to celebrate the 100th edition of the race and 2015 , to celebrate the 40th finish on the Champs - Élysées , by having riders complete 10 laps of the circuit .
ARRIVALS Section::::Arrivals .
Due to the high profile of the last day as well as its setting , the stage is prestigious .
The overall Tour placings are typically settled before the final stage so the racing is often for the glory of finishing the Tour and , at times , to settle the points classification .
Traditionally , the stage starts with champagne served by the race leader 's team , on - the - road photo opportunities and joking around .
As the riders approach Paris , the racing heats up as the sprinters and their teams begin the real racing of the day .
When the riders reach central Paris , they enter the Champs - Élysées riding up the Rue de Rivoli , on to the Place de la Concorde and then swing right on to the Champs - Élysées itself .
The riders ride now a total of 8 laps ( up towards the Arc de Triomphe , down the Champs - Élysées , round les Tuileries and the Louvre and across the Place de la Concorde back to the Champs - Élysées ) .
In past Tours , the riders would complete ten laps before the Tour was over .
When a rider has reached a significant milestone over the course of the concluding Tour , it is customary for the peloton to let him enter the Champs - Elysées section of the stage in first place .
Such an honor was bestowed upon American George Hincapie in 2012 , in recognition of his final and record setting 17th Tour de France .
While a number of riders will try to pull away from the peloton on the Champs - Elysées , chances of success are slim and these attempts are often seen as one last opportunity for teams to showcase their colors .
It is extremely hard for a small group to resist the push of chasing sprinter 's teams on the stage 's flat circuit , even more so than in a linear race , and the overwhelming majority have ended in a mass sprint .
In early years , breakaway wins did not appear uncommon .
A surprising three straight occurred between 1977 and 1979 .
However , with the advent of modern racing tactics , the feat has become very rare , lending an increasingly valued place in Tour lore to the few who have achieved it .
Those are Frenchmen Alain Meslet ( 1977 ) , Bernard Hinault ( 1979 ) and Eddy Seigneur ( 1994 ) , Dutchman Gerrie Knetemann ( 1978 ) , American Jeff Pierce ( 1987 ) , and Kazakh Alexander Vinokourov ( 2005 ) .
GENERAL CLASSIFICATION Section::::General classification .
There are a few exceptions , in which the last stage saw attacks on the leading position in the general classification .
In 1979 , Joop Zoetemelk was 3:07 behind Bernard Hinault before the final stage .
Zoetemelk attacked on the last stage , hoping to win enough time to claim the victory .
Hinault chased Zoetemelk , and beat him for the stage victory .
In 1989 , Greg LeMond beat Laurent Fignon by 58 seconds over a 24 km time trial from Versailles .
In doing so , he closed a 50-second gap to win the 1989 Tour de France by eight seconds .
It was the first ( and only ) time trial final stage on the Champs - Élysées .
The 1964 , 1965 and 1967 Tours finished with time trials to the Parc des Princes , and the 1968 to 1971 stages had time trials to the Vélodrome de Vincennes ( Cipale ) .
In 2005 , Lance Armstrong had a comfortable lead in the general classification , but behind him Alexander Vinokourov and Levi Leipheimer were only two seconds apart , on fifth and sixth place .
Vinokourov succeeded in a breakaway during the last kilometre and , because of his stage win and bonus seconds , overtook Leipheimer for fifth position overall .
As of 2018 , this is the last time the stage was not decided in a bunch sprint .
In 2015 , bad weather caused the Tour organisers to declare the overall classification neutralised upon entry to the Champs - Élysées , 70 km before the stage finished .
POINTS CLASSIFICATION Section::::Points classification .
In some years , the points classification was decided on that last stage .
In 1984 , Frank Hoste had been leading the points classification for most of the race , but Sean Kelly had taken over the lead on the penultimate stage , with a difference of 4 points .
Hoste ended third in the last stage against Kelly fifth , which made Hoste the winner by 4 points .
In the final stages of the 1987 Tour de France , the lead in the points classification switched between Jean - Paul van Poppel and Stephen Roche .
Before the final stage , Roche was leading by 17 points , but during the last stage Van Poppel won back 16 points by intermediate sprints .
Van Poppel 's ninth place in the stage was then enough to win the points classification by 16 points .
In 1991 , Djamolidine Abdoujaparov clipped his wheels on barriers .
With less than 100 m left he tumbled head - over - heels in a spectacular crash .
After he regained consciousness , he was helped across the line to clinch the sprinters ' competition .
In 2001 , Stuart O'Grady had been leading the points classification for most of the race , but Erik Zabel overtook him at the final moment .
In 2003 , the green jersey was settled by a close finish between Baden Cooke and Robbie McEwen finishing 2nd and 3rd respectively , this meant that Baden Cooke finished with 216 points to Robbie McEwen 's 214 .
