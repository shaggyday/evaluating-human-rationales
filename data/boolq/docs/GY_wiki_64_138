SPEED LIMITS IN GERMANY General speed limits in Germany are set by the federal government .
All limits are multiples of 5 km / h .
There are two default speed limits : 50 km / h ( 31 mph ) inside built - up areas and 100 km / h ( 62 mph ) outside built - up areas .
While parts of the autobahns and many other freeway - style highways have posted limits up to 130 km / h ( 81 mph ) based on accident experience , congestion and other factors , many rural sections have no general speed limit .
The German Highway Code ( Straßenverkehrsordnung ) section on speed begins with the requirement which may be rendered in English :
Any person driving a vehicle may only drive so fast that the car is under control .
Speeds must be adapted to the road , traffic , visibility and weather conditions as well as the personal skills and characteristics of the vehicle and load .
This requirement applies to all roads , and is similar to the " reasonable speed " legal obligation levied in other nations .
Speed limits are enforced with a small tolerance .
Driving merely 3 km / h ( 2 mph ) or faster above the posted or implied speed limit is considered a punishable infraction in Germany .
The speeding fines are set by federal law ( Bußgeldkatalog , schedule of fines ) .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The Nazi - era Road Traffic Act of 28 May 1934 imposed the first nationwide speed limit : maximum in urban areas , but no limit on rural highways or autobahns .
In October 1939 , the Nazis further throttled speeds in order to conserve fuel : in urban areas , elsewhere .
After the war , the four Allied occupation zones established their own speed limits until the divided East German and West German republics were constituted in 1949 ; initially , the Nazi speed limits were restored in both East and West Germany .
In December 1952 the West German legislature voted to abolish all speed limits , reverting to State - level decisions .
However , rising traffic fatalities led to a partial reversal : an urban speed limit of became effective 1 September 1957 , despite resistance by the German Auto Club .
By 1970 , fatalities had climbed to over 19,000 ; in 1972 a general rural speed limit of went into effect — except on motorways .
At 14 November 1983 the Hamburg suburb of Buxtehude had the first implementation of limits in residential areas , a concept that became popular .
East Germany 's safety efforts primarily focused on restrictive traffic regulation ; for examples , zero alcohol tolerance , on autobahns and outside cities .
Within two years after German reunification in 1990 , the availability of high - powered vehicles and a 54 % increase in motorized traffic led to a doubling of annual traffic deaths , despite interim continuation of prior speed restrictions .
An extensive program of the four Es ( enforcement , education , engineering , and emergency response ) brought the number of traffic deaths back to pre - unification levels after ten years while traffic regulations were conformed to western standards ( e.g. , 130 km / h ( 81 mph )
Autobahn advisory limit , 100 km / h ( 62 mph ) on other rural roads , and 0.5 milligrams BAC .
AUTOBAHNS Section::::Autobahns .
German autobahns are famous for having no universal motorway speed limit , although slightly more than 50 % of them have posted speed limits and about 10 % are equipped with motorway control systems that can show variable speed limits .
There is no national speed limit , either , for cars and motorcycles on any highway outside of towns if it has a central reservation or a minimum of two marked lanes per direction .
Due to this it is common to be overtaken by cars or motorcycles travelling over 200 km / h ( 125 mph ) .
On such roads , as well as motorways , a recommended speed limit ( Richtgeschwindigkeit ) of 130 km / h ( 81 mph ) applies .
While driving at higher speeds is not punishable , the increased risk induced by higher speeds ( erhöhte Betriebsgefahr ) may result in partial liability for damages .
Moreover , the law forbids travel at speeds that would extend the vehicle 's minimum halting distance beyond the driver 's line of sight .
On all German roads , there are speed limits for trucks , buses , cars towing trailers , and small motorised vehicles ( Mopeds , etc . ) .
The introduction of a national speed limit for motorways and similar roads has been on the agenda of various political and environmentalist groups for decades , but at present , there are still no definite plans on behalf of the federal government regarding the matter .
HISTORY Section::::History .
In 1973 , in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis , a federal speed limit of 100 km / h ( 62 mph ) on Autobahns was imposed to help conserve fuel for fear of impending future shortages ( not for environmental or safety reasons ) .
The measure only lasted from December 1973 to March 1974 ; while the administration and the Bundestag were in favor of keeping the speed limit , the Bundesrat pushed to repeal the law .
As a compromise , a recommended speed was introduced on Autobahns and " highways outside of built - up areas with a center divide or without a center divide and a continuous lane for overtaking in both directions " .
This law is basically still in effect today .
Unrestricted non - Autobahn highways , however , have since become virtually non - existent or replaced by Schnellstraßen , Autobahn - like expressways typically limited to 120 or 130 km / h and normally only covering a few kilometers .
The Umweltbundesamt ( Federal Environmental Agency ) repeated its recommendation of such regulation in early 2007 , but the Merkel administration saw no need for it .
Even after a 2007 party congress held by the SPD , then one of Germany 's governing parties , where a proposal to impose a blanket speed limit was approved , there was outspoken opposition within the administration .
At present , it is generally thought that a blanket speed limit would not be significantly beneficial , regarding both environmental and climate concerns and road safety .
Current estimates conclude that a speed limit would reduce Germany 's overall CO2 emission by a mere fraction of a percent , and in terms of highway safety , German Autobahns are among the world 's safest .
Legally , however , state and even local authorities have the power to enact speed limits .
The district of Köln /
( Cologne ) has posted a speed limit on the heavily frequented Kölner Autobahnring / ( Cologne Beltway ) .
Effective 9 April 2008 , the City - State of Bremen began enforcing a general 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) speed limit , citing environmental concerns .
However , Bremen 's new limit only impacted an additional 11 kilometers of Bremen 's 60 kilometers of Autobahn ; most Bremen motorways already had some speed restriction due to congestion and noise .
In 2006 , half of German motorways had no maximum speed limit at any time of day or under any traffic conditions .
Roughly one third of regulated roads have computer - controlled traffic guiding systems with variable electronic signs along carriageways showing the set speed limit , or , current road conditions and traffic density allowing , indicating that no speed limit is set at the moment .
MINIMUM SPEED
Section::::Minimum speed .
Posted minimum speeds usually only apply to specific lanes like the common configuration on 6-lane roads with a minimum speed of 110 km / h ( 68 mph ) on the left and 90 km / h ( 56 mph ) on the center lane .
Vehicles which can not sustain speeds of 60 km / h ( 37 mph ) on the flat are not allowed on the Autobahn , however .
Because of this , many European self - propelled cranes and other extra - heavy trucks which would be unsafe at much higher speeds , but similarly unsafe or impractical ( and certainly obstructive ) to drive for long distances on surface streets between job sites and depots , are engineered with maximum design speeds a little over 60 km / h -
typically 62 km / h ( 39 mph ) at governed engine speed in top gear .
ACCIDENT STATISTICS
Section::::Accident statistics .
In 2013 , autobahns carried 31 % of motorized road traffic while accounting for 13 % of Germany 's traffic deaths .
The autobahn fatality rate of 1.9 deaths per billion - travel - kilometers compared favorably with the 4.7 rate on urban streets and 6.6 rate on rural roads .
Between 1970 and 2010 , overall German road fatalities decreased by almost 80 % from 19,193 to 3,648 ; over the same time period , autobahn deaths halved from 945 to 430 deaths .
Statistics for 2013 show total German traffic deaths declined to the lowest count ever recorded : 3340 ; a representative of the Federal Statistical Office attributed the general decline to harsh winter weather that delayed the start of the motorcycle - riding season .
However , autobahn deaths increased over 2012 counts ( from 387 to 428 ) .
Nevertheless autobahn deaths with involved trucks are increased .
The reason is more truck traffic and traffic jams caused of roadworks .
Whereas accidents without involved trucks are decrasing again . !

Rural roads , except for motorways or other designated fast roads , have a speed limit of 100 km / h ( 62 mph ) , which is routinely reduced to 70 km / h ( 43 mph ) or 80 km / h ( 50 mph ) where the road approaches a junction with a significant side - road .
Tree - lined scenic routes , such as the German Avenue Road , often have 70 km / h ( 43 mph ) limits .
Lorries , some buses , and cars towing trailers have lower speed limits as well .
In 2015 , the German Safety Council recommended that the general limit be set at 80 km / h ( 50 mph ) for rural roads less than six meters wide .
The proposed speed would reduce the differential with trucks 3.5 metric tonne trucks , which generally travel at 60 km / h ( 37 mph ) .
In 2013 , rural roads spanned approximately 200,000 kilometers in length , and killed at least 1,934 people .
CITY LIMITS Section::::City limits .
There is a general speed limit within built up areas , which are marked by distinctive rectangular yellow signs showing the name of the village , town or city , of 50 km / h ( 31 mph ) but residential areas usually have a lower posted speed limit of 30 km / h ( 18 mph ) .
On arterial roads , the speed limit may be raised to 60 or 70 km / h ( 37 to 43 mph ) ; this higher speed limit will be posted in the usual way .
Motorways crossing cities count as normal Autobahns and can be used for travel within larger cities in many cases .
Minimum speeds are very rarely marked in Germany .
TRUCK SPEED LIMITS
Section::::Truck speed limits .
There is a general speed limit of 80 km / h ( 50 mph ) for trucks with a GVWR over 3,500 kg ( 7,716 lbs ) and for vehicles with trailers .
For vehicles with a GVWR of over 7,500 kg ( 16,534 lbs ) the limit is set to 60 km / h ( 37 mph ) except on autobahns ( also 80 km / h ) .
For coaches and cars with trailers the limit is increased to 100 km / h on autobahns ( under certain requirements ) .
Posted speed signs for trucks are not common , they can be seen on some dangerous curves or descents .
Trucks over 3,500 kg are required to have a built - in speed limiter for a maximum speed of 90 km / h ( 56 mph ) , and buses for a maximum speed of 100 km / h ( 62 mph ) .
There are a few exceptions for army , police , fire brigade or scientific purposes .
