WII MOTIONPLUS
The is an expansion device for the Wii Remote video game controller for the Wii that allows it to capture complex motion more accurately .
According to Nintendo , the sensor in the device supplements the accelerometer and Sensor Bar capabilities of the Wii Remote to enable actions to be rendered identically on the screen in real time .
The Wii 's successor console , the Wii U , supports the Wii MotionPlus and its peripherals in games where use of its touchscreen - built - in primary controller is not necessary .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The Wii MotionPlus was announced by Nintendo in a press release on July 14 , 2008 , and revealed the next day at a press conference at the E3 Media & Business Summit .
It was released in June 2009 .
On May 3 , 2010 , Nintendo announced that starting May 9 , 2010 , the company will include its Wii Sports Resort game and MotionPlus controller with new consoles with no price increase .
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Development .
The Wii MotionPlus was developed by Nintendo in collaboration with game development tool company AiLive .
The sensor used is an InvenSense IDG-600 or IDG-650
in later units , designed in accordance to Nintendo 's specification ; with a high dynamic range , high mechanical shock tolerance , high temperature and humidity resistance , and small physical size .
The Wii MotionPlus was conceived soon after the completion of the initial Wii Remote design , to address developer demand for more capable motion sensing , but was only announced after the sensors could be purchased in sufficient volume at a reasonable price .
During a developer roundtable discussion at E3 2008 , Wii Sports Resort producer Katsuya Eguchi discussed the potential influence of the Wii MotionPlus on the Wii 's existing market , stating that Nintendo was looking at whether the MotionPlus capability will be built into the Wii Remote in the future , or kept " as an attachment we only use for certain software . "
In November 2009 , a black Wii MotionPlus was released to coincide with the release of the black Wii console .
Bundles containing a black Wii Remote and MotionPlus attachment were also released .
In North America , all black , blue , and pink Wii remotes are bundled with a MotionPlus .
The Wii Remote Jacket accompanying each black Wii Remote is itself black , while the jacket in blue and pink bundles is the standard translucent color .
In a 2010 Nintendo Conference , the Wii Remote Plus was announced , which places the function of the MotionPlus into a regular sized Wii remote .
TECHNOLOGY AND FEATURES Section::::Technology and features .
The device incorporates a dual - axis tuning fork gyroscope , and a single - axis gyroscope which can determine rotational motion .
The information captured by the angular rate sensor can then be used to distinguish true linear motion from the accelerometer readings .
This allows for the capture of more complex movements than possible with the Wii Remote alone .
The Wii MotionPlus features a pass - through External Extension Connector , allowing other expansions such as the Nunchuk or Classic Controller to be used simultaneously with the device .
The attachment has a color - coded mechanical slide switch for locking the clip release .
When attached to the ( original , non - MotionPlus )
Wii Remote , the add - on unit extends the length of the controller body by approximately .
Each Wii MotionPlus includes a longer version of the Wii Remote Jacket to accommodate the added length , and according to Nintendo , the Wii MotionPlus is unsafe to use without it .
However , the newer Wii Remote Plus eliminates the need for such elongated jackets by integrating the MotionPlus technology into the Remote itself .
The device is only used by games that have been specifically developed to use its functionality .
It can remain attached to the Wii Remote when playing games that do not support it without causing any problems , but it will not enhance gameplay .
The add - on version of the device is incompatible with any Wii Remote accessories that snugly encase the Remote itself , such as the Wii Wheel , the Wii Zapper , guitar controllers for Guitar Hero and Rock Band games and NHL Slapshot 's hockey stick accessory .
