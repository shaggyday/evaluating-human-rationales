NEW YORK CITY SHERIFF 'S OFFICE
The New York City Sheriff 's Office ( NYSO ) , officially the Office of the Sheriff of the City of New York , is the primary civil enforcement agency for New York City .
The Sheriff 's Office is a division of the New York City Department of Finance , operating as the civil enforcement arm .
The Sheriff 's Office is headed by a sheriff , who is appointed to the position by the mayor , unlike most sheriffs in New York State who are elected officials .
The sheriff is the chief civil enforcement officer for the City of New York , and automatically ( ex officio ) holds the position of deputy commissioner in the Department of Finance .
The sheriff holds jurisdiction over all five county - boroughs within the city , with a subordinate undersheriff in charge of each one .
Deputy sheriffs and criminal investigators of various ranks carry out the daily law enforcement duties of the Sheriff 's Office .
New York City Marshals perform similar civil enforcement duties .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The New York City Sheriff 's Office originated in 1626 as the New York County Sheriff 's Office .
Originally each of the city 's five county - boroughs had their own sheriff , each of which held the widest law enforcement jurisdiction in their respective county - borough .
Like most sheriffs in the United States , these office holders were elected to their positions .
Once the city was consolidated in 1898 , the New York City Police Department took over responsibility for criminal investigations throughout the entire city , while the Sheriff 's Office continued to focus on civil law enforcement and administering the county prison systems .
Sheriffs were compensated by charging fees for enforcing civil orders in addition to keeping a monetary percentage ( known as poundage ) of what their office would seize .
By 1915 , plans were made by the Commissioner of Accounts to alter the way sheriffs were compensated to include a determined salary instead of having the office holder personally retain fees and poundage .
Although fees and poundage would still be charged by sheriffs , the monies would be retained for their respective county 's use only .
In 1938 , the first female deputy sheriff was appointed .
On January 1 , 1942 , each of the city 's five county sheriff 's offices were merged to become the Office of the Sheriff of the City of New York .
The city 's five county sheriffs were abolished and replaced with borough " chief deputies " ( later undersheriffs ) reporting to the now mayorally - appointed citywide sheriff .
A contemporary report of the changes emphasized professionalization of the office , which had become notorious for employing political patronage beneficiaries .
The new top five commanders were " all college graduates " and " lawyers like their chief , who promises to keep out politics " .
At the same time , the sheriff 's former responsibility for running prison systems was transferred to the newly established New York City Department of Correction .
In 2012 , the New York City Sheriff 's Office changed its emblems , uniforms and logos to more closely resemble those of the New York Police Department , and to avoid confusion with fire department or emergency services .
Finance Department spokesman Owen Stone said " We had red and white .
We changed it to blue and yellow , because it 's more in line with other law enforcement . "

In order to be appointed as deputies , candidates must first pass a civil service entrance examination and meet strong educational / experiential requirements .
Candidates must also pass medical and psychological examinations , physical ability tests , and a full background investigation .
In addition to deputy sheriffs , the Sheriff 's Office employs sworn criminal investigators and an assortment of civilian support personnel .
As of June 2014 , Joseph Fucito was appointed the 121st Sheriff of the City of New York .
Sheriff Fucito has over 25 years of experience in the New York City Sheriff 's Office , and came up through the ranks of deputy sheriff .
He has commanded a wide variety of units and county offices , and also served as acting sheriff two separate times before his official appointment to sheriff .
STRUCTURE
Section::::Structure .
The New York City Sheriff 's Office is composed of three sections : Operations , Intelligence , and Support .
Operations Section
The Operations Section is composed of the five county field offices and certain units working citywide .
Within the county field offices , deputy sheriffs assigned to civil enforcement duties are referenced as Enforcement Bureau ( EB ) personnel .
EB deputies perform a wide array of tasks such as evictions , warrants of arrest , orders to commit , and the seizure and sale of property pursuant to judicial mandates .
Businesses and individuals that owe the city money pursuant to unpaid city tax warrants , environmental control board summons , and fire and health code violation fines , are targeted for enforcement action .
EB deputies also serve a wide variety of legal process , with orders of protection considered a priority .
Each county field office is complemented by civilian support staff to assist in daily administrative functions and customer service .
These field offices are accessible to the public , giving citizens of the county / borough a local place to file court process in need of enforcement .
Deputies of the Operations Section may be assigned to duties separate from the EB , either within a county field office or citywide .
These duties include arrests and apprehensions on behalf of other none law enforcement city agencies such as the Human Resources Administration , the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene , and the Administration for Children 's Services .
Deputies may be assigned to scofflaw enforcement or security duties at the city treasury .
The Operations Section will also provide deputies for any other assignment as deemed necessary by the agency .
Intelligence Section
The Intelligence Section is composed of the Bureau of Criminal Investigation ( BCI ) and the Intelligence Unit .
The BCI investigates city tax violation , real property larceny / deed fraud , synthetic narcotic enforcement ( such as spice / K2 and bath salts ) and other offenses against the Department of Finance .
The Intelligence Unit collects , analyzes , and disseminates information from various sources to be readily available for agency use .
Intelligence Section personnel include criminal investigators , deputy sheriffs , and civilian support personnel .
Support Section
The Support Section handles communications , property disposition , evidence destruction and field support services for the entire agency .
Support Section personnel include deputy sheriffs and criminal investigators .
In addition to these organizational sections , the Sheriff 's Office is served by a Chaplain Support Unit and a Medical Support Unit .
POWER AND AUTHORITY Section::::Power and authority .
Deputy sheriffs and criminal investigators are New York State peace officers with authority to make warrantless arrests , issue summonses , carry and use a firearm , batons , pepper spray , handcuffs , and use physical and deadly force .
Deputy sheriffs receive their peace officer status pursuant to the New York State Criminal Procedure Law ( CPL ) § 2.10 subdivision 2 , while criminal investigators receive their peace officer status from CPL § 2.10 subdivision 5 .
Deputy sheriffs are also civil enforcement officers with authority to enforce the New York State Civil Practice Law and Rules ( CPLR ) concerning civil procedure .
DUTIES Section::::Duties .
The NYC Sheriff 's Office focuses on civil violations , such as property seizure and cigarette tax enforcement .
