VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER
A vehicle identification number ( VIN ) is a unique code , including a serial number , used by the automotive industry to identify individual motor vehicles , towed vehicles , motorcycles , scooters and mopeds , as defined in ISO 3779 ( content and structure ) and ISO 4030 ( location and attachment ) .
VINs were first used in 1954 in the United States .
From 1954 to 1981 , there was no accepted standard for these numbers , so different manufacturers used different formats .
In 1981 , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the United States standardized the format .
It required all on - road vehicles sold to contain a 17-character VIN , which does not include the letters
I ( i ) , O ( o ) , and Q ( q ) ( to avoid confusion with numerals 1 and 0 ) .
There are vehicle history services in several countries that help potential car owners use VINs to find vehicles that are defective or have been written off .
See the Used car article for a list of countries where this service is available .
CLASSIFICATION Section::::Classification .
There are at least four competing standards used to calculate the VIN .
* FMVSS 115 , Part 565 : Used in United States and Canada * ISO Standard 3779 : Used in Europe and many other parts of the world
* SAE J853 : Very similar to the ISO standard * ADR 61/2 used in Australia , referring to ISO 3779 and 3780 COMPONENTS Section::::Components .
Modern VINs are based on two related standards , originally issued by the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) in 1979 and 1980 : ISO 3779 and ISO 3780 , respectively .
Compatible but different implementations of these ISO standards have been adopted by the European Union and the United StatesWorld manufacturer

MANUFACTURER IDENTIFIER Section::::World manufacturer identifier .
The first three characters uniquely identify the manufacturer of the vehicle using the world manufacturer identifier or WMI code .
A manufacturer who builds fewer than 1000 vehicles per year uses a 9 as the third digit , and the 12th , 13th and 14th position of the VIN for a second part of the identification .
Some manufacturers use the third character as a code for a vehicle category ( e.g. , bus or truck ) , a division within a manufacturer , or both .
For example , within 1 G ( assigned to General Motors in the United States ) , 1G1 represents Chevrolet passenger cars ; 1G2 , Pontiac passenger cars ; and 1GC , Chevrolet trucks .
The Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE ) in the U.S. assigns WMIs to countries and manufacturers .
The first character of the WMI is the region in which the manufacturer is located .
In practice , each is assigned to a country of manufacture , although in Europe the country where the continental headquarters is located can assign the WMI to all vehicles produced in that region ( Example :
Opel / Vauxhall cars whether produced in Germany , Spain , the United Kingdom or Poland carry a WMI of W0L because Adam Opel AG is based in Rüsselsheim , Germany ) .
In the notation below , assume that letters precede numbers and that zero is the last number .
For example , 8X–82 denotes the range 8X , 8Y , 8Z , 81 , 82 , excluding 80 .

unassigned VEHICLE DESCRIPTOR SECTION Section::::Vehicle descriptor section .
The fourth to ninth positions in the VIN are the vehicle descriptor section or VDS .
This is used , according to local regulations , to identify the vehicle type , and may include information on the automobile platform used , the model , and the body style .
Each manufacturer has a unique system for using this field .
Most manufacturers since the 1980s have used the eighth digit to identify the engine type whenever there is more than one engine choice for the vehicle .
Example : for the 2007 Chevrolet Corvette , U is for a 6.0-liter V8 engine , and E is for a 7.0 L V8 .
NORTH AMERICAN CHECK DIGITS
Section::::North American check digits .
One element that is fairly consistent is the use of position nine as a check digit , compulsory for vehicles in North America and China , and used fairly consistently elsewhere .
VEHICLE IDENTIFIER SECTION Section::::Vehicle identifier section .
The 10th to 17th positions are used as the ' vehicle identifier section ' ( VIS ) .
This is used by the manufacturer to identify the individual vehicle in question .
This may include information on options installed or engine and transmission choices , but often is a simple sequential number .
In North America , the last five digits must be numeric .
MODEL YEAR ENCODING
Section::::Model year encoding .
One consistent element of the VIS is the 10th digit , which is required worldwide to encode the model year of the vehicle .
Besides the three letters that are not allowed in the VIN itself ( I , O and Q ) , the letters U and Z and the digit 0 are not used for the model year code .
The year code is the model year for the vehicle .
The year 1980 was encoded by some manufacturers , especially General Motors and Chrysler , as " A " ( since the 17-digit VIN was not mandatory until 1981 , and the " A " or zero was in the manufacturer 's pre-1981 placement in the VIN ) , yet Ford and AMC still used a zero for 1980 .
Subsequent years increment through the allowed letters , so that " Y " represents the year 2000 .
2001 to 2009 are encoded as the digits 1 to 9 , and subsequent years are encoded as " A " , " B " , " C " , etc . !

Year
On April 30 , 2008 , the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration adopted a final rule amending 49 CFR Part 565 , " so that the current 17 character vehicle identification number ( VIN ) system , which has been in place for almost 30 years , can continue in use for at least another 30 years " , in the process making several changes to the VIN requirements applicable to all motor vehicles manufactured for sale in the United States .
There are three notable changes to the VIN structure that affect VIN deciphering systems :
*
The make may only be identified after looking at positions one through three and another position , as determined by the manufacturer in the second section or fourth to eighth segment of the VIN .
*
In order to identify the exact year in passenger cars and multipurpose passenger vehicles with a GVWR of 10,000 or less , one must read position 7 as well as position 10 .
For passenger cars , and for multipurpose passenger vehicles and trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of or less , if position seven is numeric , the model year in position 10 of the VIN refers to a year in the range 1980–2009 .
If position seven is alphabetic , the model year in position 10 of VIN refers to a year in the range 2010–2039 .
* The model year for vehicles with a GVWR greater than , as well as buses , motorcycles , trailers and low - speed vehicles , may no longer be identified within a 30-year range .
VIN characters 1–8 and 10 that were assigned from 1980–2009 can be repeated beginning with the 2010 model year .
PLANT CODE Section::::Plant code .
Compulsory in North America and China is the use of the 11th character to identify the factory at which the vehicle was built .
Each manufacturer has its own set of plant codes .
PRODUCTION NUMBER Section::::Production number .
In the United States and China , the 12th to 17th digits are the vehicle 's serial or production number .
This is unique to each vehicle , and every manufacturer uses its own sequence .
CHECK - DIGIT CALCULATION Section::::Check - digit calculation .
Check - digit validation is compulsory for all road vehicles sold in North America .
When trying to validate a VIN with a check digit , first either ( a ) remove the check digit for the purpose of calculation or
( b ) use a weight of zero ( see below ) to cancel it out .
The original value of the check digit is then compared with the calculated value .
If the calculated value is 0–9 , the check digit must match the calculated value .
If the calculated value is 10 , the check digit must be X.
If the two values do not match ( and there was no error in the calculation ) , then there is a mistake in the VIN .
However , a match does not prove the VIN is correct , because there is still a 1/11 chance that any two distinct VINs have a matching check digit : for example , the valid VINs 5GZCZ43D13S812715 ( correct with leading five ) and SGZCZ43D13S812715 ( incorrect with leading character " S " ) .
The VINs in the Porsche image , WP0ZZZ99ZTS392124 , and the GM - T body image , KLATF08Y1VB363636 , do not pass the North American check - digit verification .
TRANSLITERATING THE NUMBERS Section::::Transliterating the numbers .
Transliteration consists of removing all of the letters , and replacing them with their appropriate numerical counterparts .
These numerical alternatives ( based on IBM 's EBCDIC ) are in the following chart .
I , O , and Q are not allowed in a valid VIN ; for this chart , they have been filled in with N / A ( not applicable ) .
Numerical digits use their own values .

WEIGHTS USED IN CALCULATION
WORKED
EXAMPLE Section::::Worked example .
Consider the hypothetical VIN 1M8GDM9A_KP042788 , where the underscore will be the check digit . !
VIN
1M8GDM9A
KP042788 !
Value 14874491027042788 !
Weight 876543210098765432 !
Products 8 284835161218100 18560 2410282416
*
The VIN 's value is calculated from the above transliteration table .
This number is used in the rest of the calculation .
*
* Copy the weights from the above weight factor table .
*
* The products row is the result of the multiplication of the vertical columns :
Value and Weight .
*
* The products ( 8 , 28 , 48 , 35 ... 24 , 16 ) are all added together to yield a sum , 351 .
*
* Find the remainder after dividing by 11351 MOD 11 = 10351 ÷ 11 = 31 /
* * The remainder is the check digit .
If the remainder is 10 , the check digit is X.
In this example , the remainder is 10 , so the check digit is transliterated as X.
* With a check digit of X , the VIN 1M8GDM9A_KP042788 is written 1M8GDM9AXKP042788 .
A VIN with straight - ones ( seventeen consecutive 1s ) has the nice feature that its check digit 1 matches the calculated value 1 .
This is because a value of one multiplied by 89 ( sum of weights ) is 89 , and 89 divided by 11 is 8 with remainder ; thus 1 is the check digit .
This is a way to test a VIN - check algorithm .
