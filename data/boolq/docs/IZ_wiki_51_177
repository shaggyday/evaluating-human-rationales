SQUARE WATERMELON Square watermelons are watermelons grown into the shape of a cube .
Square watermelons are common in Japan , but they are purely ornamental and are often very expensive , with prices as high as $ 100 .
PURPOSES AND USES Section::::Purposes and Uses .
Square watermelons were intended to fit more compactly in fridges and be able to be cut more easily ( without rolling ) .
They were invented by graphic designer Tomoyuki Ono in 1978 .
She presented the watermelons in a gallery in Ginza , Tokyo .
She also applied for and received a patent in the United States .
The melons are grown in boxes and assume the shape of the container .
They tend to appeal to wealthy or fashionable consumers because in 2001 they cost anywhere from two to three times a normal watermelon ( at about $ 83 ) .
Although square melons were originally created with practicality in mind , the cost now is prohibitive .
The cube shape of the watermelon can only be achieved at the expense of its contents .
To retain the proper shape , square melons must be harvested before they are ripe , rendering them inedible .
Since the advent of the square watermelon , other watermelon shapes have been introduced , such as hearts and pyramids .
They are also available in other countries now , such as in Germany .
