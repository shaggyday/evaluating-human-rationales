DEVIL 'S FOOD CAKE Devil 's food cake is a moist , airy , rich chocolate layer cake .
It is considered a counterpart to the white or yellow angel food cake .
Because of differing recipes and changing ingredient availability over the course of the 20th century , it is difficult to precisely qualify what distinguishes devil 's food from the more standard chocolate cake , though it traditionally has more chocolate than a regular chocolate cake , making it darker .
The cake is usually paired with a rich chocolate frosting .
OVERVIEW Section::::Overview .
Devil 's food cake is commonly a dense , rich chocolate cake .
It traditionally uses unsweetened chocolate baking squares in lieu of unsweetened cocoa powder .
However , contemporary recipes typically use cocoa powder for its convenience over the more traditional chocolate baking squares .
Also , because of its reduced amount of cocoa butter , cocoa powder has a more intense chocolate flavor than unsweetened chocolate .
Moreover , coffee is frequently added as a liquid to enhance the chocolate flavor .
Some recipes use hot or boiling water as the cake 's main liquid , rather than milk .
Its antithetical counterpart , the angel food cake , is a very light white cake that uses stiffly beaten egg whites and no dairy .
Devil 's food cake is sometimes distinguished from other chocolate cakes by the use of additional baking soda ( sodium bicarbonate ) , which raises the pH level and makes the cake a deeper and darker mahogany color .
Devil 's food cake incorporates butter ( or a substitute ) , eggs , flour , and less egg than other chocolate cakes .
Devil 's food cake was invented in the United States in the early twentieth century , with the recipe in print as early as 1905 .
