POPLITEAL LYMPH NODES
The popliteal lymph nodes , small in size and some six or seven in number , are embedded in the fat contained in the popliteal fossa , sometimes referred to as the ' knee pit ' .
One lies immediately beneath the popliteal fascia , near the terminal part of the small saphenous vein , and drains the region from which this vein derives its tributaries , such as superficial regions of the posterolateral aspect of the leg and the plantar aspect of the foot .
Another is between the popliteal artery and the posterior surface of the knee - joint .
It receives afferents from the knee - joint , together with those that accompany the genicular arteries .
The others lie at the sides of the popliteal vessels , and receive , as efferents , the trunks that accompany the anterior and posterior tibial vessels .
The efferents of the popliteal lymph nodes pass almost entirely alongside the femoral vessels to the deep inguinal lymph nodes , but a few may accompany the great saphenous vein , and end in the glands of the superficial subinguinal group .
The flow of lymph from the legs towards the heart is the result of the calf pump â€“ during walking the calf muscle contracts , squeezing lymph out of the leg via the lymphatic vessels .
When the muscle relaxes , valves in the vessels shut preventing the fluid from returning to the lower extremities .
