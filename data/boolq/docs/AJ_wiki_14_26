CANDELA PER
SQUARE METRE
The candela per square metre ( cd / m ) is the derived SI unit of luminance .
The unit is based on the candela , the SI unit of luminous intensity , and the square metre , the SI unit of area .
Nit ( nt ) is a non - SI name also used for this unit ( 1 nt = 1 cd / m ) .
The term nit is believed to come from the Latin word nitere , to shine .
As a measure of light emitted per unit area , this unit is frequently used to specify the brightness of a display device .
The sRGB spec for monitors targets 80 cd / m .
Typically , calibrated monitors should have a brightness of 120 cd / m .
Most consumer desktop liquid crystal displays have luminances of 200 to 300 cd / m .
High - definition televisions range from 450 to about 1500 cd / m .
