THE BOONDOCKS ( TV SERIES )
The Boondocks is an American adult animated sitcom on Cartoon Network 's late - night programming block , Adult Swim .
Created by Aaron McGruder , based upon his comic strip of the same name , the series premiered on November 6 , 2005 .
The show begins with a black family , the Freemans , settling into the fictional , friendly and overall white suburb of Woodcrest .
The perspective offered by this mixture of cultures , lifestyles , social classes , stereotypes , viewpoints and racialized identities provides for much of the series ' satire , comedy , and conflict .
The Boondocks ended its run on June 23 , 2014 , with a total of 55 episodes over the course of the show 's four seasons .
The fourth and final season was produced without any involvement from McGruder .
The series also airs in syndication outside the United States and has been released on various DVD sets and other forms of home media .
DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION Section::::Development and production .
The Boondocks began as a comic strip on Hitlist.com , one of the first online music websites .
The strip later found its way into The Source magazine .
Following these runs , McGruder began simultaneously pitching The Boondocks both as a syndicated comic strip and an animated television series .
The former goal was met first , and The Boondocks debuted in newspapers in April 1999 .
In the meantime , development on The Boondocks TV series continued .
McGruder and film producer / director Reginald Hudlin ( President of Entertainment for BET from 2005–08 ) created a Boondocks pilot for the Fox Network , but found great difficulty in making the series acceptable for network television .
Hudlin left the project after the Fox deal fell through , although McGruder and Sony Television are contractually bound to continue to credit him as an executive producer .
Mike Lazzo , president of Adult Swim and executive producer for Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Space Ghost Coast to Coast , stumbled across the pilot and declared it " too networky " .
He then ordered a 15-episode season and told McGruder to " just tell stories " .
The series has a loose connection with the continuity of the comic strip , though during the final year of the strip McGruder made a point to try to synchronize both .
He introduced Uncle Ruckus into the strip , and the comic - strip version of Riley 's hair was braided into cornrows to match the character 's design in the series .
During Season 1 , McGruder put the strip on a 6-month hiatus beginning in March 2006 .
He did not return to the strip the following November , and the strip 's syndicate , Universal Press Syndicate , announced that it had been cancelled .
The opening theme song used in the series ( slightly remixed for Season 2 and 3 ) is performed by hip - hop artist Asheru .
The series was produced in widescreen since the beginning ; however , the image was cropped to accommodate the aspect ratio at the time of their original broadcasts as well as reruns .
Cropping widescreen material is a practice Adult Swim rarely uses .
Since the third season , the series has been produced in high definition and is presented in its original aspect ratio and resolution .
In 2014 , it was announced that Aaron McGruder would not be involved in the show 's fourth and final season .
Adult Swim stated that " a mutually agreeable production schedule could not be determined .
" The first episode of the fourth ( and final ) season was first broadcast on April 21 , 2014 , with the series eventually concluding its run on June 23 , 2014 .
SETTING
Section::::Setting .
The series opens with the Freemans settling into the fictional , peaceful , and mostly white suburb of Woodcrest .
Evidence for the real - world location of the fictional Woodcrest is mixed .
Proponents of the Chicago 's South Side theory cite the real - life suburb of Crestwood , Illinois and the similarity of the two names .
The first season features several Chicago Landmarks : a skyline shot showing the Willis Tower , Grant Park , buildings of the Michigan Avenue Historic District , and Lake Michigan ; as well as elevated rapid transit endemic to the city , resembling the Chicago " L " .
More conclusive evidence is presented in " The Trial of Robert Kelly " , in which Riley asks Grandad , " Can you take us into the City tomorrow to watch the R. Kelly Trial ? " .
Grandad denies his request and tells him to walk , and Riley replies "
But it 's 40 miles !
"
In reality , R. Kelly is from Chicago , and this trial was in fact held in there , giving more evidence that The Boondocks is in fact set in Illinois .
Another conclusive reference to Chicago is Martin Luther King Drive , a major street running through South Chicago , being referenced for its violent activity in the 9th episode of season 1 , " Return of the King " .
Additionally , in " Let 's Nab Oprah " , Ed Wuncler III , Gin Rummy and Riley go to Oprah Winfrey 's television studio in an attempt to kidnap her .
Oprah 's television show was recorded at Harpo Studios in Near West Side Chicago .
Proponents of the Columbia , Maryland theory , however , cite other evidence , such as series creator Aaron McGruder 's own childhood growing up there , while his father worked for the National Transportation Safety Board .
In the comics , Huey 's cellphone number has a 443 area code , which belongs to the Baltimore metropolitan area .
In " Wingmen , " the Freemans fly ' home ' to Chicago , where they lived before moving to Woodcrest , to attend a funeral .
In " The Fried Chicken Flu , " a reporter on a passing television screen reports on the titular disease 's effect on the state of Maryland .
In addition , in Season 4 's first episode " Pretty Boy Flizzy , " a man references an upcoming concert at Woodcrest Post Pavilion , which may be a play on Columbia 's notable concert venue Merriweather Post Pavilion .
CHARACTERS
* Huey Freeman ( voiced by Regina King ) –
10-year - old Huey Freeman is the family 's moral compass and voice of reason .
He is an intelligent , wise - beyond - his - years avid reader who is knowledgeable about a variety of subjects .
He is heavily influenced by the theories of various left - wing social movements and social justice leaders .
His brother and grandfather constantly ridicule and underestimate him , thinking he is a fool to have goals and values that aim higher than the expectations of mainstream American culture .
It is mentioned that he has been declared a " domestic terrorist " .
While he promotes various social causes , he is openly contemptuous of Urban Gangster Rap / Hip Hop as portrayed in mainstream media for glamorizing wasteful extravagance , self - defeating lifestyles , and ignorance .
Huey , unlike the other characters , rarely smiles ; in the episode " Let 's Nab Oprah " he smiles after his duel with Riley ; he also smiles when Riley begins to win basketball games in " Ballin ' " .
He is a highly skilled kung - fu fighter , and beats Riley with ease in all of their fights .
He has only lost to a few opponents .
* Riley Freeman ( voiced by Regina King ) –
Riley Freeman is Huey 's mischievous , rebellious 8-year - old brother , an enthusiastic follower of Urban Gangster Rap / Hip Hop .
Though he is otherwise charming , clever , and artistically gifted , Riley maintains loyalty to those Gangster Rap ideals , even in the face of their self - destructive consequences .
In " The Fundraiser " Huey tries to warn him directly about the foregone conclusions of his poor decisions , but Riley offhandedly rebuffs him .
The bulk of the series focuses on Riley 's misadventures ( most of which are fueled by his love of gangsta rap and a desire to emulate other people he admires ) or on his various outlandish schemes , which his grandfather often endorses and aids .
Despite his wild nature and attempts to appear tough , Riley occasionally shows a softer , innocent side .
While his brother practices martial arts , Riley is skilled in street fighting , as shown in " Home Alone " and " Smokin ' with Cigarettes " .
* Robert Jebediah " Grandad " Freeman ( voiced by John Witherspoon ) – Robert Freeman ( AKA " Grandad " ) is the grandfather and legal guardian of Huey and Riley .
While he loves his two grandsons , he sometimes explodes in tirades of angry frustration over their wisecracking observations , constant schemes , and misadventures , although he has his own moments ; for instance , his eagerly misguided dating pursuits unwittingly attract bizarre or dangerous women .
According to Season 3 's " It 's a Black President , Huey Freeman " , " Nobody knows exactly how old Robert Freeman is -- not even himself . "
Robert often threatens to discipline his grandsons , mainly Riley with Three Stooges - style corporal punishment and has developed a remarkable degree of speed and dexterity in wielding his belt for this purpose .
EPISODES
Section::::Episodes .
Both the comic strip and the cartoon were influenced by McGruder 's love of anime and manga .
He cites Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo as sources of inspiration for the series ' fight scenes .
The opening sequence of Season 1 contains similarities to that of Samurai Champloo .
Some of the humor is based on the characters ' anime - style movements .
In 2006 , McGruder explained in an interview , " We now have a Japanese anime studio named Madhouse to help us out " , but at some point , the deal with Madhouse fell through .
Instead , MOI Animation , an Emmy Award - winning South Korean studio , handled the animation for season two onwards .
As a result , the following seasons of the series have more detailed animation , as well as minor updates for most of the character designs .
The episode " Pause " presents a thinly veiled parody of Tyler Perry , presented as using his religion to hide his cross - dressing .
The episode reportedly angered Perry , with the network responding to his complaints by saying that they should have warned him before the episode aired .
On March 21 , 2014 , it was revealed via press release from Adult Swim that The Boondocks would be renewed for a fourth and final season .
However , it was also revealed that the fourth season would also take place without the involvement of the series creator Aaron McGruder .
The reason cited for the split between the creator and the company was a disagreement over the production schedule of the fourth season .
SOCIAL CRITIQUE
POLITICAL CRITICISM Section::::Social Critique .
Section::::Political Criticism .
The Boondocks gives commentary on American politics from an African American perspective .
The series accomplishes this by using satire and controversial statements , such as one of the opening lines in the series , " Jesus was Black , Ronald Reagan was the devil , and the government is lying about 9/11 .
"
The show has also given input on subjects like the American government 's response to Hurricane Katrina , the War in Iraq , and other controversial political events that took place throughout the 2000s .
When asked about the show and the approaches taken that make it so controversial , series creator Aaron McGruder stated , " ...
I just hope to expand the dialogue and hope the show will challenge people to think about things they would n't normally think about , or think about it in a very different way . "
BLACK CULTURAL RELEVANCE AND CRITIQUE Section::::Black Cultural Relevance and Critique .
The series typically features appearances by well - known entities ( singers , rappers , public figures ) within the Black popular culture as well as parodies of these entities .
Episodes often feature many cameos , much like the episode
" Let 's Nab Oprah , " which features appearances from Oprah Winfrey , Maya Angelou , and Bill Cosby .
Other appearances and parodies within the show includes R. Kelly on trial for sexual misconduct accusations , DMX 's disbelief when told about Barack Obama running for president in an interview , and an episode that mimicked Juice .
The series also involves parodies of famous news reports including a broadcast in which a freshman in high school was called a " nigga " by his teacher , who thought the word was acceptable to use .
The Boondocks recreates this incident with Riley and his teacher .
The series often challenges the way in which African Americans behave and think within its episodes .
The show has used sardonic humor to teach lessons and get people thinking since it was a comic strip , making critiques at the behavior of famous African Americans throughout the early 2000s .
Aaron McGruder was interviewed by Nightline in early 2006 on the episode , " Return of the King " which sparked much controversy after Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. reprimanded a crowd of African Americans for being lazy and unaware of their political climate .
In the interview , McGruder said , " In the episode , King is critical of our apathy and inactivity ...
We carry the blame of our own apathy and inactivity ...
We deserve to take a look at that and be honest about it . "
THE " N " WORD Section::::The " N " Word .
The Boondocks is known for its frequent usage of the " n " word , which has been a source of controversy for the show throughout its tenure .
However , McGruder once stated about the word within the show , " I think it makes the show sincere ...
the N - word is used so commonly now , not only by myself
but people I know , that I feel it 's fake to write around it and not use it . "
He also said in a 2005 ABC News article , " This is n't the nigga show ...
I just wish we would expand the dialogue and evolve past the same conversation that we 've had over the past 30 years about race in our country . "
RECEPTION Section::::Reception .
The Boondocks has received critical acclaim .
In January 2006 , it was nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series at the 37th NAACP Image Awards alongside The Bernie Mac Show , Everybody Hates Chris , Girlfriends , and Half & Half .
The show won a Peabody Award in 2006 for the episode " Return of the King .
" The first season garnered positive reviews , having a score of 72 out of 100 on Metacritic , based on 21 reviews .
IGN named it the 94th - best animated series , describing it as a sharp satirical look at American society .
Critic Jeffrey M. Anderson of the San Francisco Examiner said , " Each episode is beautifully crafted , with an eye on lush , shadowy visuals and a pulsing , jazz - like rhythm ...
the show is almost consistently funny , consistently brilliant , and , best of all , compulsively watchable . "
Mike Hale of the New York Times has considered The Boondocks among the top television shows of 2010 , citing " Pause " as a " painfully funny " satire of Tyler Perry being portrayed as a superstar actor and a leader of a homoerotic cult .
In 2013 , IGN placed The Boondocks as number 17 on their list of Top 25 animated series for adults .
CRITICISM AND CONTROVERSY Section::::Criticism and controversy .
The Boondocks has been a frequent subject of controversy since its comic - strip debut in 1999 , with ABC News noting , " Fans and critics of The Boondocks loved and hated the strip for the same reasons : its cutting - edge humor and unapologetic , sometimes unpopular , views on various issues , including race , politics , the war on terrorism and the September 11 attacks . "
Numerous outlets predicted the show would encounter controversy prior to its November 2005 debut , due to its casual use of the word " nigger " .
According to an article in The Washington Post , references to Rosa Parks were removed from one of the series ' first completed episodes within a week of her death .
In 2006 , the Reverend Al Sharpton protested the first - season episode " Return of the King , " for Martin Luther King , Jr. 's character 's use of the word " nigga , " saying " Cartoon Network must apologize and also commit to pulling episodes that desecrate black historic figures . "
Cartoon Network released a statement in response defending McGruder : " We think Aaron McGruder came up with a thought - provoking way of not only showing Dr. King 's bravery but also of reminding us of what he stood and fought for , and why even today , it is important for all of us to remember that and to continue to take action , " the statement said .
The episode was later awarded a Peabody Award for being " an especially daring episode " .
During The Boondocks Season 2 , two episodes were removed from broadcast without any official word from the network .
Originally slated to air on November 16 and December 17 , " The Hunger Strike " and " The Uncle Ruckus Reality Show " were both heavily critical of BET .
An exclusive clip of " The Hunger Strike " was given to HipHopDX.com in late January 2008 , before both episodes were included in full on the Season 2 DVD release that summer .
An anonymous source close to the show told HipHopDX.com that they heard BET had been pressuring Sony ( the studio behind The Boondocks ) to ban the episodes and threatened legal action .
Cartoon Network publicly stated that " ... neither Turner nor Adult Swim were contacted by BET , Ms. Lee or Mr. Hudlin " .
However , BET 's parent company , Viacom , did threaten legal action against Sony if said episodes were broadcast to air in the United States .
Tyler Perry was reportedly infuriated by his depiction in the Season 3 episode " Pause " , first aired in June 2010 , although he has officially given no response .
The episode stars Winston Jerome , a parody of Perry , a " closeted , cross - dressing cult leader whose love of the Christian faith is a mask for his true sexuality , " in what the Los Angeles Times described as " one of the sharpest public criticisms of Perry " .
Soon after the episode aired , Perry got in touch with executives at Turner Broadcasting and " complained loudly " about the episode , threatening to rethink his relationship with the company .
In 2010 , Time magazine named The Boondocks as sixth out of 10 of the Most Controversial Cartoons of All Time .
