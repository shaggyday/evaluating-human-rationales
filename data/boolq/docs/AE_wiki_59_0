TITIUS –
BODE LAW
The Titius – Bode law ( sometimes termed just Bode 's law ) is a hypothesis that the bodies in some orbital systems , including the Sun 's , orbit at semi - major axes in a function of planetary sequence .
The formula suggests that , extending outward , each planet would be approximately twice as far from the Sun as the one before .
The hypothesis correctly anticipated the orbits of Ceres ( in the asteroid belt ) and Uranus , but failed as a predictor of Neptune 's orbit and was eventually superseded as a theory of Solar System formation .
It is named for Johann Daniel Titius and Johann Elert Bode .
FORMULATION Section::::Formulation .
The law relates the semi - major axis formula_1 of each planet outward from the Sun in units such that the Earth 's semi - major axis is equal to 10 : where formula_3 with the exception of the first step , each value is twice the previous value .
There is another representation of the formula :
formula_4
where formula_5 .
The resulting values can be divided by 10 to convert them into astronomical units ( AU ) , resulting in the expression for formula_7 For the outer planets , each planet is predicted to be roughly twice as far from the Sun as the previous object .
ORIGIN AND HISTORY Section::::Origin and history .
The first mention of a series approximating Bode 's law is found in David Gregory 's The Elements of Astronomy , published in 1715 .
In it , he says , " ... supposing the distance of the Earth from the Sun to be divided into ten equal Parts , of these the distance of Mercury will be about four , of Venus seven , of Mars fifteen , of Jupiter fifty two , and that of Saturn ninety five . "
A similar sentence , likely paraphrased from Gregory , appears in a work published by Christian Wolff in 1724 .
In 1764 , Charles Bonnet said in his Contemplation de la Nature that , " We know seventeen planets that enter into the composition of our solar system [ that is , major planets and their satellites ] ; but we are not sure that there are no more . "
To this , in his 1766 translation of Bonnet 's work , Johann Daniel Titius added two of his own paragraphs , at the bottom of page 7 and at the beginning of page 8 .
The new interpolated paragraph is not found in Bonnet 's original text , nor in translations of the work into Italian and English .
There are two parts to Titius 's intercalated text .
The first part explains the succession of planetary distances from the Sun : Take notice of the distances of the planets from one another , and recognize that almost all are separated from one another in a proportion which matches their bodily magnitudes .
Divide the distance from the Sun to Saturn into 100 parts ; then Mercury is separated by four such parts from the Sun , Venus by 4 + 3=7 such parts , the Earth by 4 + 6=10 , Mars by 4 + 12=16 .
But notice that from Mars to Jupiter there comes a deviation from this so exact progression .
From Mars there follows a space of 4 + 24=28 such parts , but so far no planet was sighted there .
But should the Lord Architect have left that space empty ?
Not at all .
Let us therefore assume that this space without doubt belongs to the still undiscovered satellites of Mars , let us also add that perhaps Jupiter still has around itself some smaller ones which have not been sighted yet by any telescope .
Next to this for us still unexplored space there rises Jupiter 's sphere of influence at 4 + 48=52 parts ; and that of Saturn at 4 + 96=100 parts .
In 1772 , Johann Elert Bode , aged twenty - five , completed the second edition of his astronomical compendium Anleitung zur Kenntniss des gestirnten Himmels ( " Manual for Knowing the Starry Sky " ) , into which he added the following footnote , initially unsourced , but credited to Titius in later versions ( in Bode 's memoir can be found a reference to Titius with clear recognition of his priority ) :
This latter point seems in particular to follow from the astonishing relation which the known six planets observe in their distances from the Sun .
Let the distance from the Sun to Saturn be taken as 100 , then Mercury is separated by 4 such parts from the Sun .
Venus is 4 + 3=7 .
The Earth 4 + 6=10 .
Mars 4 + 12=16 .
Now comes a gap in this so orderly progression .
After Mars there follows a space of 4 + 24=28 parts , in which no planet has yet been seen .
Can one believe that the Founder of the universe had left this space empty ?
Certainly not .
From here we come to the distance of Jupiter by 4 + 48=52 parts , and finally to that of Saturn by 4 + 96=100 parts .
These two statements , for all their particular typology and the radii of the orbits , seem to stem from an antique cossist .
Many precedents were found from before the seventeenth century .
Titius was a disciple of the German philosopher Christian Freiherr von Wolf ( 1679 - 1754 ) .
The second part of the inserted text in Bonnet 's work is founded in a von Wolf work dated 1723 , Vernünftige Gedanken von den Wirkungen der Natur .
Twentieth century literature about Titius – Bode law assigns the German philosopher authorship ; if so , Titius could have learned from him .
Another older reference was written by James Gregory in 1702 , in his Astronomiae physicae et geometricae elementa , where the succession of planetary distances 4 , 7 , 10 , 16 , 52 and 100 became a geometric progression of ratio 2 .
This is the nearest Newtonian formula , which is also contained in Benjamin Martin and Tomàs Cerdà years before the German publication of Bonnet 's book .
Titius and Bode hoped that the law would lead to the discovery of new planets , and indeed the discovery of Uranus and Ceres , both of whose distances fit well with the law , contributed to the law 's fame .
Neptune 's distance was very discrepant , however , and indeed Pluto — now discredited as a planet — is at a mean distance that roughly corresponds to that the Titus - Bode law predicted for the next planet out from Uranus .
When originally published , the law was approximately satisfied by all the known planets — Mercury through Saturn — with a gap between the fourth and fifth planets .
It was regarded as interesting , but of no great importance until the discovery of Uranus in 1781 , which happens to fit into the series .
Based on this discovery , Bode urged a search for a fifth planet .
, the largest object in the asteroid belt , was found at Bode 's predicted position in 1801 .
Bode 's law was then widely accepted until Neptune was discovered in 1846 and found not to satisfy the law .
Simultaneously , the large number of asteroids discovered in the belt removed Ceres from the list of planets .
Bode 's law was discussed by the astronomer and logician Charles Sanders Peirce in 1898 as an example of fallacious reasoning .
The discovery of Pluto in 1930 confounded the issue still further .
Although nowhere near its position as predicted by Bode 's law , it was roughly at the position the law had predicted for Neptune .
However , the subsequent discovery of the Kuiper belt , and in particular of the object , which is more massive than Pluto yet does not fit Bode 's law , further discredited the formula .
A POTENTIALLY EARLIER EXPLANATION
Section::::A
potentially earlier explanation .
The Jesuit Tomàs Cerdà ( 1715 - 1791 ) gave a famous astronomy course in Barcelona in 1760 , at the Royal Chair of Mathematics of the College of Sant Jaume de Cordelles ( Imperial and Royal Seminary of Nobles of Cordellas ) .
From the original manuscript preserved in the Royal Academy of History in Madrid , Lluís Gasiot remade Tratado de Astronomía from Cerdá , published in 1999 , based on Astronomiae physicae from James Gregory ( 1702 ) and Philosophia Britannica from Benjamin Martin ( 1747 ) .
In the Cerdàs 's Tratado appears the planetary distances obtained from the periodic times applying Kepler 's third law , with an accuracy of 10 .
Taking as reference the distance from Earth as 10 and rounding to whole , the geometric progression [ ( D x 10 ) -
4 ] /
[ ( D x 10 ) - 4 ] = 2 , from n=2 to n=8 can be expressed .
And using the circular uniform fictitious movement to Kepler 's Anomaly , R values corresponding to each planet 's ratios may be obtained as r =
( R - R ) /
( R - R )
resulting 1.82 ; 1.84 ; 1.86 ; 1.88 and 1.90 , which r = 2 - 0.02 ( 12 - n ) , the ratio between Keplerian succession and Titius - Bode Law , which would be a casual numerical coincidence .
The reason is close to 2 , but increases harmonically from 1.82 .
The planet 's average speed from n=1 to n=8 decreases moving away the Sun and differs from uniform descent in n=2 to recover from n=7 ( orbital resonance ) .

No solid theoretical explanation underlies the Titius – Bode law , but it is possible that given a combination of orbital resonance and shortage of degrees of freedom , any stable planetary system has a high probability of satisfying a Titius – Bode - type relationship .
Since it may be a mathematical coincidence rather than a " law of nature " , it is sometimes referred to as a rule instead of " law " .
However , astrophysicist Alan Boss states that it is just a coincidence , and the planetary science journal Icarus no longer accepts papers attempting to provide improved versions of the " law " .
Orbital resonance from major orbiting bodies creates regions around the Sun that are free of long - term stable orbits .
Results from simulations of planetary formation support the idea that a randomly chosen stable planetary system will likely satisfy a Titius – Bode law .
Dubrulle and Graner showed that power - law distance rules can be a consequence of collapsing - cloud models of planetary systems possessing two symmetries : rotational invariance ( the cloud and its contents are axially symmetric ) and scale invariance ( the cloud and its contents look the same on all scales ) , the latter is a feature of many phenomena considered to play a role in planetary formation , such as turbulence .
LUNAR SYSTEMS AND OTHER PLANETARY SYSTEMS Section::::Lunar systems and other planetary systems .
Only a limited number of systems are available on which Bode 's law can presently be tested .
Two solar planets have enough large moons that probably have formed in a process similar to that which formed the planets .
The four big satellites of Jupiter and the biggest inner satellite , Amalthea , cling to a regular , but non - Titius – Bode , spacing , with the four innermost locked into orbital periods that are each twice that of the next inner satellite .
The big moons of Uranus have a regular , non - Titius – Bode spacing .
However , according to Martin Harwit , " a slight new phrasing of this law permits us to include not only planetary orbits around the Sun , but also the orbits of moons around their parent planets .
" The new phrasing is known as Dermott 's law .
Of the recent discoveries of extrasolar planetary systems , few have enough known planets to test whether similar rules apply .
An attempt with 55 Cancri suggested the equation a
= 0.0142 e , and controversially predicts for n = 5 an undiscovered planet or asteroid field at 2 AU .
Furthermore , the orbital period and semimajor axis of the innermost planet in the 55 Cancri system have been significantly revised ( from 2.817 days to 0.737 days and from 0.038 AU to 0.016 AU respectively ) since the publication of these studies .
Recent astronomical research suggests that planetary systems around some other stars may follow Titius – Bode - like laws .
Bovaird and Lineweaver applied a generalized Titius – Bode relation to 68 exoplanet systems that contain four or more planets .
They showed that 96 % of these exoplanet systems adhere to a generalized Titius – Bode relation to a similar or greater extent than the Solar System does .
The locations of potentially undetected exoplanets are predicted in each system .
Subsequent research detected five planet candidates from predicted 97 planets from the 68 planetary systems .
The study showed that the actual number of planets could be larger .
The occurrence rate of Mars- and Mercury - sized planets are currently unknown , so many planets could be missed due to their small size .
Other reasons includes planets that do not transit the star or that the predicted space is occupied by circumstellar disks .
Despite this , the number of planets found with Titius – Bode law predictions were lower than expected .
In a 2018 paper , the idea of a hypothetical eighth planet around TRAPPIST-1 named " TRAPPIST-1i , " was brought up by using the Titius – Bode law .
1i had a prediction based just on the Titius – Bode law of an orbital period of 27.53 ± 0.83 days .
