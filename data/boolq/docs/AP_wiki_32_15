AMPHOTERISM
In chemistry , an amphoteric compound is a molecule or ion that can react both as an acid and as a base .
Many metals ( such as copper , zinc , tin , lead , aluminium , and beryllium ) form amphoteric oxides or hydroxides .
Amphoterism depends on the oxidation states of the oxide .
AlO is an example of an amphoteric oxide .
The prefix of the word ' amphoteric ' is derived from a Greek prefix amphi- , which means both .
In chemistry , an amphoteric substance is a substance that has the ability to act either as an acid or a base .
Remember that acids donate protons ( or accept electron pairs ) and bases accept protons .
Amphoteric substances can do either .
Metal oxides which react with both acids as well as bases to produce salts and water are known as amphoteric oxides .
Amphoteric oxides include lead oxide and zinc oxide , among many others .
One type of amphoteric species are amphiprotic molecules , which can either donate or accept a proton ( H ) .
Examples include amino acids and proteins , which have amine and carboxylic acid groups , and self - ionizable compounds such as water .
Ampholytes are amphoteric molecules that contain both acidic and basic groups and will exist mostly as zwitterions in a certain range of pH.
The pH at which the average charge is zero is known as the molecule 's isoelectric point .
Ampholytes are used to establish a stable pH gradient for use in isoelectric focusing .
ETYMOLOGY Section::::Etymology .
Amphoteric is derived from the Greek word ( ) meaning " both " .
Related words in acid - base chemistry are amphichromatic and amphichroic , both describing substances such as acid - base indicators which give one colour on reaction with an acid and another colour on reaction with a base .
AMPHIPROTIC MOLECULES Section::::Amphiprotic molecules .
According to the Brønsted - Lowry theory of acids and bases : acids are proton donors and bases are proton acceptors .
An amphiprotic molecule ( or ion ) can either donate or accept a proton , thus acting either as an acid or a base .
Water , amino acids , hydrogen carbonate ion ( bicarbonate ion ) and hydrogen sulfate ion ( bisulfate ion ) are common examples of amphiprotic species .
Since they can donate a proton , all amphiprotic substances contain a hydrogen atom .
Also , since they can act like an acid or a base , they are amphoteric .
EXAMPLES Section::::Examples .
A common example of an amphiprotic substance is the hydrogen carbonate ion , which can act as a base : or as an acid :
Thus , it can effectively accept or donate a proton .
Water is the most common example , acting as a base when reacting with an acid such as hydrogen chloride : and acting as an acid when reacting with a base such as ammonia :
NOT ALL AMPHOTERIC SUBSTANCES ARE AMPHIPROTIC Section::::Not
all amphoteric substances are amphiprotic .
Although an amphiprotic species must be amphoteric , the converse is not true .
For example , the metal oxide ZnO contains no hydrogen and can not donate a proton .
Instead it is a Lewis acid whose Zn atom accepts an electron pair from the base OH .
The other metal oxides and hydroxides mentioned above also function as Lewis acids rather than Brønsted acids .

Section::::Amphoteric oxides .
Zinc oxide ( ZnO ) reacts with both acids and with bases : *
In acid : ZnO + HSO → ZnSO + HO
*
In base : ZnO + 2 NaOH + HO → Na[Zn(OH ) ]
This reactivity can be used to separate different cations , such as zinc(II ) , which dissolves in base , from manganese(II ) , which does not dissolve in base .
Lead oxide ( PbO ) :
*
In acid : PbO + 2 HCl → PbCl +
HO
*
In base : PbO + 2 NaOH + HO → Na[Pb(OH ) ] Aluminium oxide ( AlO ) *
In acid : AlO + 6 HCl→ 2 AlCl + 3 HO
*
In base : AlO + 2 NaOH + 3 HO → 2 Na[Al(OH ) ]
( hydrated sodium aluminate )
Stannous oxide ( SnO ) *
In acid : SnO +2 HCl SnCl +
HO
*
In base : SnO +4 NaOH + HO Na[Sn(OH ) ]
Some other elements which form amphoteric oxides are gallium , indium , scandium , titanium , zirconium , vanadium , chromium , iron , cobalt , copper , silver , gold , germanium , antimony , bismuth , and tellurium .
AMPHOTERIC HYDROXIDES Section::::Amphoteric hydroxides .
Aluminium hydroxide is also amphoteric : *
As a base ( neutralizing an acid ) : Al(OH ) + 3 HCl → AlCl +
3 HO
*
As an acid ( neutralizing a base ) : Al(OH ) + NaOH → Na[Al(OH ) ]
Beryllium hydroxide * with acid : Be(OH ) + 2 HCl → BeCl + 2 HO * with base : Be(OH ) + 2 NaOH → Na[Be(OH ) ] .
