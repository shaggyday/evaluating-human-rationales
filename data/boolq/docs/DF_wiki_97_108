FICTIONAL CHARACTER
BIOGRAPHY
Section::::Fictional character biography .
Daisy Johnson is a superhuman with seismic ( earthquake - producing ) powers , and is the illegitimate daughter of Calvin Zabo , the supervillain known as Mister Hyde .
Taken in by S.H.I.E.L.D. , she is under the careful eye of its longtime executive director , Nick Fury , even after the latter 's defection from the agency during the events of the Secret War series .
Daisy herself was a participant in this incident , where Fury used trickery , lies and outright brainwashing in order to secure a superhero team to overthrow the legitimate government of Latveria .
This later resulted in a terror attack on American soil ; Daisy destroys the cyborg leader .
She possesses a " Level 10 " security clearance , the only known agent aside from Fury and the Black Widow ( Natasha Romanova ) to do so .
In her most visible action , Johnson has helped to defeat the powerful mutant leader Magneto by inducing a vibration in his brain that made him lose consciousness .
This was during a three - way confrontation with the X - Men , Avengers and the " Collective " - a powered being carrying thousands of mutant energy signatures .
Daisy states in this appearance that if she were to join the superhero team the Avengers , she would adopt the moniker " Quake " .
The Avengers had splintered due to the events of the 2006â€“2007 " Civil War " storyline and she is later seen reunited with Nick Fury , in disguise , who gives her new orders to recruit the descendants of various villains and heroes in order to assist him with the threat against the Skrulls in their Secret Invasion .
Taking on the name Quake , she and her teammates attack the Skrulls during their invasion of Manhattan .
The team becomes a part of Fury 's Secret Warriors , with Daisy acting as field leader of the Caterpillars .
While investigating Norman Osborn 's escape from the Raft , Johnson is drafted by Captain America into the Avengers under her superhero name Quake .
She is tasked with tracking down how Osborn appeared via hologram in the middle of a supposedly secure press conference .
Daisy takes over as director of S.H.I.E.L.D. when Nick Fury fully retires and his son joins as an agent .
Maria Hill is the Acting Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. , while Johnson is still considered Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Johnson was indefinitely suspended after launching an unsanctioned operation to assassinate Andrew Forson , the Scientist Supreme , leader of the supposedly legitimate A.I.M. Island .
Hill is promoted to Director in her place .
In the S.H.I.E.L.D. series , Daisy later reveals to her father that she has uncovered the origin of her abilities : she is an Inhuman whose genetic abilities were activated by her father 's unstable DNA , rather than through Terrigenesis .
The nickname " Skye " , Daisy 's original name from the show , is also introduced to comics as Coulson 's affectionate name for her , and she is redesigned with the likeness of Chloe Bennet .
POWERS AND ABILITIES Section::::Powers and abilities .
Daisy Johnson generates powerful waves of vibrations which can produce effects resembling those of earthquakes .
She is immune to any harmful effects of the vibrations .
She also has or was given a form of psychic shielding .
She is also a superb hand - to - hand combatant , skilled all - around athlete , and excellent marksman .
She was a leading espionage agent , adept at undercover assignments .
Her training under Fury enables her to target her seismic waves with pinpoint accuracy , causing targeted objects to vibrate themselves apart , from the inside out .
This is shown in her being able to prevent the detonation of an antimatter bomb implanted in the body of Lucia von Bardas by destroying its power supply , and exploding the heart of Wolverine while in his chest , to halt an enraged attack on S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury .

She was then approached by Nick Fury , who offered her superpowers in exchange for joining his West Coast version of the Ultimates .
The project was shut down and later reactivated by a corrupt California governor who sent them after the Ultimates .
