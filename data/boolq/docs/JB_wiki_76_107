RECEPTION Section::::Reception .
Vinyl received mixed - to - positive reviews from critics .
The acting ( particularly Cannavale ) and directing were generally praised , while the writing and storyline , particularly in the later half of the season , which many called " formulaic " and " familiar " , were criticized .
On Rotten Tomatoes the first five episodes ( which were given to critics in advance ) holds an approval rating of 77 % .
The site 's consensus reads : " Vinyl does n't always keep the beat , dramatically speaking , but overall , it capably honors the rock pioneers of the ' 70s with absorbing stories , a spot - on soundtrack , and rich period detail . "
On another review aggregator , Metacritic , the first five episodes holds a score of 71 out of 100 .
But as the series progressed , reviews got significantly more critical .
Alan Sepinwall of HitFix gave the first season a B , writing that " there 's an awful lot of excess in Vinyl , which perhaps makes sense for a show involving two icons of ' 70s rock in Jagger and Scorsese .
But all of Richie 's searching for the next idea , and all of the scenes involving the Nasty Bits or other rising forms of music , suggest a show that really wishes it could strip away all the glam and all the tropes and just do something simple and raw and powerful . "
Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that " what follows is a sometimes humorous , sometimes nostalgic , sometimes bumpy ride through the era , with a story that often seems to halt just when it 's picking up momentum .
Still , every time the story falters , the characters ' and the show 's obvious love for popular music in all its forms lifts it back up . "
On the other hand , Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker had a mixed response , writing that " the show improves slightly after the jankily paced pilot , but it never sheds its air of leaden nostalgia . "
Verne Gay of Newsday reacted negatively , writing that the show " is a compelling idea in search of a compelling story .
There simply is n't much of one , in fact , and -- abhorring the ever - present vacuum -- a lot of other elements rush in to fill the void .
Scenes are padded , lots of flashbacks are even more flaccid , while actors devour the helpless scenery . "
