7.62×54MMR
The 7.62×54mmR is a rimmed rifle cartridge developed by the Russian Empire and introduced as a service cartridge in 1891 .
Originally designed for the bolt - action Mosin –
Nagant rifle , it was used during the late Tsarist era and throughout the Soviet period to the present day .
The cartridge remains one of the few standard - issue rimmed cartridges still in military use and has the longest service life of all military - issued cartridges in the world .
The American Winchester Model 1895 was also chambered for this cartridge per a contract with the Russian government .
The 7.62×54mmR is still in use by the Russian military in the Dragunov and other sniper rifles , as well as some modern general - purpose machine guns like the PKM and Pecheneg machine gun .
Originally , the round was designated as " Трехлинейный патрон образца 1891 года " – ( Three - line cartridge model of 1891 ) .
It then became widely known under the designation
" 7,62 мм винтовочный патрон " ( 7.62 mm rifle cartridge ) .
The round has erroneously come to be known as the " 7.62 mm Russian " ( and is still often referred to as such colloquially ) , but , according to standards , the " R " in designation ( 7.62×54mmR ) stands for Rimmed , in line with standard C.I.P. designations .
The name is sometimes confused with the " 7.62 Soviet " round , which refers to the rimless 7.62×39 mm cartridge used in the SKS and AK - based ( AK-47 , AK-15 , AEK-973 ) rifles . BACKGROUND Section::::Background .
The 7.62×54mmR is the oldest cartridge still in regular combat service with several major armed forces in the world .
In 2011 , the cartridge reached 120 years in service .
the 7.62×54mmR is mainly used in designated marksman / sniper rifles like the Dragunov sniper rifle , SV-98 and machine guns like the PKM .
Because of performance similar to the iconic American .30 - 06 cartridge , a similarly rich military and historic heritage , and amazing longevity , the 7.62×54mmR is nicknamed " the Russian .30 - 06 " by some .
It is also one of the few ( along with the .22 Hornet , .30 - 30 Winchester , and
.303 British ) bottlenecked , rimmed centerfire rifle cartridges still in common use today .
Most of the bottleneck rimmed cartridges of the late 1880s and 1890s fell into disuse by the end of the First World War .
The .30 - 06 Springfield cartridge ( 7.62×63 mm ) , with its higher service pressure and case capacity , will outperform the 7.62×54mmR when same - length test barrels are used , though this is very uncommon as .30 - 06 Springfield firearms are generally sold with much shorter barrels than 7.62×54mmR firearms .
Commonly available 7.62×54mmR commercial ammunition chronographs around from the typical Mosin - Nagant ( 29 " ) barrel , while the heavier loads chonograph in the low range .
This is identical to .30 - 06 Springfield performance from a 24 " barrel and slightly better than .30 - 06 Springfield performance from a 22 " barrel .
The 7.62×54mmR originally had a 13.7 g ( 210 grain )
" Jager " round - nosed full metal jacket ( FMJ ) bullet .
The projectile was replaced in 1908 by the Лёгкая Пуля ( Lyogkaya pulya , " Light Bullet " )
spitzer bullet , whose basic design has remained to the present .
The Lyogkaya pulya , or " L"-bullet , had a ballistic coefficient ( G1 BC ) of approximately 0.338 and ( G7 BC ) of approximately 0.185 .
COMPARISON
WITH 7.62×51MM NATO Section::::Comparison with 7.62×51 mm NATO .
Most 7.62×54mmR loads are slightly superior compared to the much later developed 7.62×51 mm NATO , with its higher service pressure and lower case capacity .
However , due to the rimmed design of the 7.62×54mmR round , reliability compared to 7.62×51 mm NATO is lower by about 17.2 % more jams and malfunctions experienced in auto - loading firearms .
This does n't by any means indicate it is a bad cartridge , just one where more care must be taken loading it into box magazines .
When brought down to basic levels , choice between the two are majorly by preference .
SNIPER ROUNDS
Section::::Sniper rounds .
To increase accuracy for the Dragunov SVD , the Soviets developed the 7N1 variant of the cartridge in 1966 .
The 7N1 was developed by V. M. Sabelnikov , P. P. Sazonov and V. M. Dvorianinov .
It used match - grade extruded powder instead of the coarser ball propellant and had a boat - tailed FMJ jacketed projectile with an air pocket , a steel core and a lead knocker in the base for maximum terminal effect .
It had a ballistic coefficient ( G1 BC ) of approximately 0.411 and ( G7 BC ) of approximately 0.206 .
Produced by " Factory 188 " ( Novosibirsk Low Voltage Equipment Plant ) , cartridges are only head - stamped with the number " 188 " and the year of manufacture .
It came packaged 20 loose rounds to a paper packet , 22 packets to a metal " spam " tin , and two tins per wooden case for a total of 880 rounds .
The individual paper packets , hermetically sealed metal ' spam ' cans , and wooden shipping crates were all distinctly marked Снайперская ( Snaiperskaya , the adjective form of " Sniper " ) .
Even the wax wrapping paper for the paper packets was covered in red text to make sure it was n't misused .
As hard body armor saw increasing use in militaries , the 7N1 was replaced in 1999 by the 7N14 special load developed for the SVD .
The 7N14 round is loaded with a projectile containing a sharp hardened steel penetrator to improve penetration which is fired with an average muzzle velocity of , for a muzzle energy of .
CARTRIDGE DIMENSIONS Section::::Cartridge dimensions .
The 7.62×54mmR has 4.16 ml ( 64 grains HO ) cartridge case capacity .
The exterior shape of the case was designed to promote reliable case feeding and extraction in bolt - action rifles and machine guns alike , under challenging conditions .
The cartridge 's shape remains the same to the present day .
7.62×54mmR maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions .
All sizes in millimeters ( mm ) .
Americans would define the shoulder angle at alpha/2 ≈ 18.5 degrees .
The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 240 mm ( 1 in 9.45 in ) , 4 grooves , Ø lands = 7.62 mm ( 0.300 in ) , Ø grooves = 7.92 mm ( 0.312 in ) , land width = 3.81 mm and the primer type is Berdan or very rarely Boxer ( in large rifle size ) .
According to the official C.I.P. ( Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives ) rulings the 7.62×54mmR can handle up to P piezo pressure .
In C.I.P. regulated countries every rifle cartridge combo has to be proofed at 125 % of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers .
This means that 7.62×54mmR chambered arms in C.I.P.-regulated countries are currently ( 2014 ) proof tested at PE piezo pressure .
PERFORMANCE Section::::Performance .
The attainable muzzle velocities and muzzle energies of the 7.62×54mmR are comparable with the 7.62×51 mm NATO cartridge .
The spitzer bullets used in the military variants have a particularly elongated shape which results in a favorable ballistic coefficient and sectional density , contributing to an adequate long - range performance and energy retention .
When used with modern hunting bullets , the 7.62×54mmR is capable of taking game in the medium- to large - sized class ( CXP2 and CXP3 ) .
The 7.62×54mmR can offer very good penetrating ability due to a fast twist rate that enables it to fire long , heavy bullets with a high sectional density .
In Russia , the 7.62×54mmR is commonly used for hunting purposes , mostly in sporterized Mosin – Nagant rifles and civil Dragunov variants ( Tigers ) .

AVAILABILITY Section::::Availability .
7.62×54mmR is widely available both as military surplus and new production , but less so for match - grade rounds .
Most surplus ammunition is steel - cased and uses Berdan primers , which effectively hinders its use for handloading .
However , with the increased popularity of surplus Eastern - bloc Mosin –
Nagant , SVT-40 , and PSL rifles in the United States ,
Boxer - primed ammunition and unfired cases are increasingly available ; these cases take large rifle primers .
