Pre - production started after the end of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike , with Depp collaborating with the writers on the story design .
Principal photography lasted for 106 days between June and November 2010 , with locations in Hawaii , the United Kingdom , Puerto Rico and California .
Filming employed 3D cameras similar to those used in the production of the 2009 film Avatar , and ten companies were involved with the film 's visual effects .

Critical reviews were mixed , with the film receiving criticism over its writing , directing , excessiveness and lack of originality ; positive mentions were given on the acting , action sequences , music , visuals and the running time for being much shorter than the previous two films .
A fifth film , titled , was released in 2017 .
PLOT Section::::Plot .
After a failed attempt to rescue his first mate , Joshamee Gibbs , in London , Captain Jack Sparrow is brought before King George II .
The king wants Jack to guide an expedition to the Fountain of Youth before King Ferdinand and the Spanish Navy can locate it .
Jack 's old nemesis , Captain Hector Barbossa , now a privateer in service to the British Navy after losing his leg and ship , the Black Pearl , which he says was sunk , is heading the expedition .
Jack refuses the offer and escapes .
He meets up with his father , Captain Teague , who warns Jack about the Fountain 's rituals .
Jack learns someone is impersonating him to recruit a crew to find the Fountain .
The impostor is Angelica , Jack 's former lover , and the daughter of the ruthless pirate Blackbeard , who practices voodoo magic and wields the mythical " Sword of Triton " that controls his ship , the Queen Anne 's Revenge .
While Jack is shanghaied aboard Blackbeard 's ship , Gibbs escapes execution by memorizing and destroying Jack 's map showing the Fountain 's location , forcing Barbossa to take him along .
Meanwhile , after a failed mutiny aboard the Queen Anne 's Revenge , Jack is forced to guide the crew to the Fountain .
Blackbeard seeks the Fountain 's power to circumvent his predestined fatal encounter with a " one - legged man " , who happened to be Barbossa .
Jack must find two silver chalices aboard Juan Ponce de León 's missing flagship , the Santiago .
The Fountain 's water must simultaneously be drunk by two people from the chalices .
Drinking from one chalice containing a mermaid 's tear will extend life ; the second person dies , their remaining years of life transferred to the other drinker .
Jack also discovers that the Black Pearl was captured and shrunk before being added to Blackbeard 's collection of other shrunken ships in bottles .
The Queen Anne 's Revenge heads for Whitecap Bay to find and harvest mermaid tears .
After managing to lure in a mermaid named Tamara , she summons other mermaids to attack the crew before Jack causes an explosion that scares them away .
A mermaid named Syrena is caught , but Philip Swift , a captive missionary , falls in love with her .
Reaching Ponce de León 's ship on an uncharted island , Angelica and Blackbeard coerce Jack into retrieving both chalices .
Jack locates the grounded , decaying vessel , only to find Barbossa there .
Both guess that the Spanish have taken the chalices , after they are nowhere to be found on the vessel .
Jack and Barbossa team up to sneak into the Spanish camp and steal the chalices .
Barbossa reveals he only wants revenge against Blackbeard for attacking the Black Pearl , and his leg being amputated .
Jack and Barbossa escape with the chalices .
Meanwhile , Syrena , reciprocating Philip 's love , is tricked into shedding a tear .
Blackbeard collects it , leaving her to die of dehydration while Philip is forced to go with them .
Jack returns with the chalices and bargains with Blackbeard for Angelica 's safety , Jack 's confiscated magical compass ( which they took from him before sending him to get the chalices ) , and Gibbs ' release .
In return , Jack vows to give Blackbeard the chalices and lead him to the Fountain ; Blackbeard agrees , and Gibbs is set free with the compass .
At the Fountain , Blackbeard 's crew is confronted by Barbossa and his men and they battle while Barbossa and Blackbeard fight .
The Spanish suddenly arrive , intending to destroy the Fountain , believing its power an abomination against God .
They crush the chalices and throw them in the swamp .
When Barbossa stabs Blackbeard with a poisoned sword , Angelica pulls it out but is cut and poisoned .
Jack notices Angelica is poisoned and begins frantically searching the swamp for the chalices .
Barbossa obtains Blackbeard 's magic sword and gains control of the Queen Anne 's Revenge and her crew .
Despite resistance from Blackbeard 's crew , the Spanish successfully pull down a pillar , crushing the Fountain of Youth .
The Spanish army leaves once the fountain is in ruins .
Philip is mortally wounded , but he returns to free Syrena .
She helps Jack retrieve the missing chalices and gives them to him , telling him not to waste her tear .
Syrena goes back to the dying Philip .
She says she can save him if he asks her to .
When he asks for her forgiveness , she kisses him and takes him underwater .
With Blackbeard and Angelica both nearing death , Jack retrieves the last remaining drops of water from the destroyed fountain and puts the tear in one of them .
Knowing that one of them must be sacrificed , he wants Angelica to drink from the chalice containing the tear .
Instead , Blackbeard drinks it , asking his daughter to save him .
Angelica agrees and drinks from the second chalice .
Jack is upset to lose Angelica , but reveals that he made a mistake about which chalice contained the tear .
Neither of the two are happy , and they both believe Jack deliberately tricked them .
Angelica 's wounds are healed as the Fountain fatally consumes Blackbeard 's body , killing him .
Eventually , Jack and Angelica admit their love for each other , yet he distrusts her intentions ( aware that she may try to avenge her father ) and strands her on a cay .
Now wielding Blackbeard 's magical sword , Barbossa captains the Queen Anne 's Revenge and returns to piracy .
Jack finds Gibbs , who had used the compass to locate the Revenge .
He reclaims the shrunken Black Pearl and the other conquered ships in bottles , carrying them in a gunny sack .
The two leave , .

PRODUCTION
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Production .
Section::::Development .
Shortly before the premiere of , Jerry Bruckheimer stated it was the end of the trilogy , but the idea of a spin - off was still possible .
After the film 's successful opening weekend , Dick Cook , then Chairman of the Walt Disney Studios , said he was interested in a fourth installment .
Los Angeles Times also reported that rights to a book were bought .
Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio had started working on a script in 2007 , but they were interrupted by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike , and only resumed in mid-2008 .
In June 2009 , Bruckheimer indicated Disney would prefer the fourth installment of Pirates to be released before The Lone Ranger film , which he , Johnny Depp , Ted Elliott , and Terry Rossio had been working on for release on May 20 , 2011 .
He hoped Gore Verbinski would return to direct the fourth film , as his BioShock film adaptation had been put on hold .
As Verbinski was unavailable due to his commitment with Rango the same year , Bruckheimer suggested Rob Marshall , who he considered a " premiere filmmaker " , stating that " Every film [ Marshall ] made I thought was unique and different . "
On July 21 , 2009 , Marshall accepted the job , because of the " whole new story line and set of characters .
It felt new , and that was important to me . "
Marshall said the film provided him a long - awaited opportunity to work with Depp , and that his directing was helped by his experience as a choreographer—"the action sequences felt like big production numbers .
"
On September 11 , 2009 , at Disney 's D23 convention during a Disney event , Cook and Johnny Depp , in full Captain Jack Sparrow costume , announced that a fourth Pirates film was in development .
The title was announced as Pirates of the Caribbean :
On Stranger Tides .
Marshall visited the Pirates of the Caribbean ride in Disneyland for inspiration , eventually paying homage with a skeleton holding a magnifying glass in Ponce de León 's ship .
An appearance of " Old Bill " , the pirate who tries to share his rum with a cat , was also filmed but cut .
Pintel and Ragetti were originally supposed to make an appearance , but director Rob Marshall opted out of the idea as he feared their roles would be cut .
Cook resigned in September 2009 after working for Disney for over 38 years .
Depp 's faith in Pirates of the Caribbean : On Stranger Tides was somewhat shaken after the resignation , with Depp explaining that " There 's a fissure , a crack in my enthusiasm at the moment .
It was all born in that office " .
Depp also explained Cook was one of the few who accepted his portrayal of Jack Sparrow : " When things went a little sideways on the and others at the studio were less than enthusiastic about my interpretation of the character , Dick was there from the first moment .
He trusted me " .
WRITING Section::::Writing .
During production of and At World 's End , writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio discovered Tim Powers ' 1987 novel On Stranger Tides , which they considered a good foundation on which to base " a new chapter " in the Pirates series .
Disney bought the rights to the novel in April 2007 .
Rossio stated that he and Elliot had considered using Blackbeard and the Fountain of Youth in the story before reading the book , " but whenever you say those words , Powers ' novel comes to mind .
There was no way we could work in that field without going into territory Tim had explored . "
However , they denied that it would be a straight version of the novel : "
Blackbeard came from the book , and in the book there is a daughter character , too .
But Jack Sparrow is not in the book , nor is Barbossa .
So I would n't call this an adaptation . "
Rossio declared the script was written to be a standalone film , " kind of a James Bond sort of thing " , instead of the " designed to be a trilogy " structure of the previous installments .
They hoped to " design a story that would support new characters , " as characters such as Will Turner would not return .
Bruckheimer added that there was a decision to " streamline the story a little bit , make it a little simpler and not have as many characters to follow " , as the number of characters and subplots in At World 's End caused the film to have an unwieldy length .
The duo decided to employ another sea myth alluded in the previous episodes : mermaids , which are briefly referenced in the book .
The mermaids ' role expanded in the script , which included a vast attack sequence .
Depp was deeply involved with the story design , frequently meeting the writers to show what he was interested in doing , and in the words of Rossio , being " involved in coming up with story lines , connecting characters , creating moments that we would then fashion , shape and then go back . "
Among Depp 's suggestions were turning Phillip into a missionary and having a Spanish contingent following the protagonists .
Afterwards , Rob Marshall and executive producer John DeLuca met Rossio and Elliot , and did alterations of their own , including building the female lead .
CASTING
Section::::Casting .
Depp signed on to return as Captain Jack Sparrow in September 2008 , saying that he would come back if the script was good .
Almost a year later , Disney announced that Depp would be paid $ 55.5 million for his role , realizing that without him the franchise would be " dead and buried . "
Geoffrey Rush expressed interest in returning to his role as Barbossa , and Bruckheimer later confirmed his presence .
Rush was positive on Barbossa having lost a leg , as he considered the disability made him " angrier , more forceful and resilient as a character " , and had to work with the stunt team for an accurate portrayal of the limp and usage of crutch , particularly during sword fighting scenes .
While the production team considered a prop pegleg to be put over Rush 's leg , the tight schedule caused it to be replaced with a blue sock that was replaced digitally , with a knob on the shoe to give Rush a reference for his walk .
Three other actors from the previous films returned , Kevin McNally as Joshamee Gibbs , Greg Ellis as Lt .
Theodore Groves , and Damian O'Hare as Lt . Gilette .
Keith Richards also had a cameo , reprising his role as Captain Teague from At World 's End ; he and Depp tried to persuade Mick Jagger to audition for the part of a pirate elder .
Previous cast members Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley stated that they would not reprise their roles , as they wanted to be involved in different films .
They both thought the storyline involving their characters had gone as far as it could .
On August 1 , 2009 , Bill Nighy expressed his desire to return as Davy Jones , who died in the saying the possibility to resurrect the character , but at the end , his inclusion was scrapped .
On February 5 , 2010 , Mackenzie Crook also announced he would not be reprising his role of Ragetti , stating , " They have n't asked me .
But actually I do n't mind that at all .
I 'm a fan of the first one especially
and I think the trilogy we 've made is great .
I 'd almost like them to leave it there . "
New cast members include Ian McShane , who plays the notorious pirate and primary antagonist of the film , Blackbeard , and Penélope Cruz , who plays Angelica , Jack Sparrow 's love interest .
According to Marshall , McShane was chosen because " he can play something evil but there 's always humor behind it as well " and the actor accepted the job due to both the " very funny and charming " script and the opportunity to work with Marshall .
The beard took one hour and a half to get applied , and McShane likened the character 's costume to " a real biker pirate — it 's all black leather . "
Marshall said Cruz was the only actress considered for the role , as she fit the description as " an actress who could not only go toe to toe with Johnny and match him , but also needed to be all the things that Jack Sparrow is in a way .
She needed to be funny and clever and smart and crafty and beautiful " , and invited her for the role as they wrapped the production of Nine .
The actress spent two months working out and learning fencing for the role .
During filming , Cruz discovered she was pregnant , leading the costume department to redesign her wardrobe to be more elastic , and the producers to hire her sister Mónica Cruz to double for Penélope in risky scenes .
Depp recommended Stephen Graham , who worked with him in Public Enemies , to play Scrum , a Machiavellian pirate and sidekick to Jack Sparrow , and Richard Griffiths for the role of King George II , as Depp was a fan of Griffiths ' work on Withnail and I. Sam Claflin , a recent drama school graduate with television experience , was chosen to play the missionary Philip , and British actor Paul Bazely also joined the cast .
Spanish news website El Pais reported that the film had four Spanish actors : Cruz , Bergès - Frisbey , Óscar Jaenada , and Juan Carlos Vellido .
Jaenada was picked for both his work in The Losers and a recommendation by Cruz .
Casting for mermaids required the actresses to have natural breasts — no implants .
As Bruckheimer explained to EW , " I do n't think they had breast augmentation in the 1700s , [ ... ]
So it 's natural for casting people to say , ' We want real people . '
"
Marshall invited Spanish - French actress Àstrid Bergès - Frisbey to play Syrena after seeing her in a French magazine article on up - and - coming actresses .
Bergès - Frisbey had to take lessons of English , swimming and breath control for the role .
The rest of the mermaid portrayers , such as Australian supermodel Gemma Ward , were chosen for having " exotic sense , an otherworldly sensibility , but also under those layers a deadly quality " , according to Marshall , and had to take swimming lessons to learn movements such as the dolphin and eggbeater kicks .
FILMING
Section::::Filming .
Principal photography began on June 14 , 2010 , in Hawaii .
Filming was moved to California in August 2010 , primarily at the Long Beach shore and a recreation of Whitecap Bay done in the Universal Studios backlot , as the original Hawaiian location on Halona Cove was plagued with strong tides .
After a brief shoot in Puerto Rico , with locations in both Palomino Island and the Fort of San Cristóbal in San Juan , production moved to the United Kingdom in September , where principal photography wrapped on November 18 after 106 days of shooting .
Locations included Hampton Court Palace in London , Knole House in Kent , and Old Royal Naval College at Greenwich .
Interiors were shot at London 's Pinewood Studios , and a replica of an 18th - century London street was built on the backlot alongside the soundstages .
The producers also considered using New Orleans as a location .
In October , security was breached at the UK site when a celebrity impersonator gained access to filming at the Old Royal Naval College by dressing up as Captain Jack .
After the joint production of Dead Man 's Chest and At World 's End cost over $ 300 million , Disney decided to give a lower budget to the fourth installment .
Many costs had to be cut , including moving primary production to Hawaii and London , where tax credits are more favorable , and having a shorter shooting schedule and fewer scenes featuring special effects compared to At World 's End .
The tighter schedule — according to Bruckheimer , " We had a 22-week post , and for a picture like this , with almost 1,200 visual effects shots , it 's usually 40 weeks"—meant that Marshall supervised editing of sequences during filming .
The British financial statements of the film revealed total expenditures of £ 240.7 million ( $ 410.6 million ) by 2013 , with Disney receiving a rebate of $ 32.1 million from the British government , making Pirates of the Caribbean : On Stranger Tides the most expensive film ever made to date .
Bruckheimer said the decision to film in 3D was made due to its being " immersive filmmaking ; I think it makes you part of the actual filming because you 're part of the screen .
" Bruckheimer described it as the first major " exterior movie " to be shot in 3D , as Avatar was mostly done in sound stages .
At first Marshall was not much interested in 3D , but the director eventually considered it a film that could benefit from the format .
" You are on an adventure and with the 3D experience you are inside that adventure .
" While the original plan was to add 3D effects during post - production , the decision was made to shoot digitally with 3D cameras .
Only one sequence was shot conventionally and needed a 3D conversion .
The cameras were improved versions of the ones James Cameron developed for Avatar , which were made more compact for extra mobility .
This meant the cameras could be brought into locations such as the Hawaiian jungle .
Queen Anne 's Revenge was built atop Sunset , the same ship used to depict Black Pearl in previous installments .
In February 2010 , Sunset was sailed from Long Beach to a shipyard in Hawaii for the reforms , where a big concern was to make it imposing , with three stories , without sacrificing actual seakeeping .
Given Blackbeard was meant to be the meanest pirate to appear in the series , the look for Queen Anne 's Revenge was ominous , with sails dyed blood red , various elements on fire , and a decoration based on skulls and bones ( drawing inspiration from the Sedlec Ossuary in Czech Republic ) .
Damage from cannon fire was also added to show that " not only Blackbeard was a dying man , but his ship is also a dying ship " .
The ship 's figurehead also drew inspiration from Blackbeard 's pirate flag .
The replica ship was used for Barbossa 's ship , HMS Providence , and all the scenes aboard Providence were shot on the Long Beach shore as Surprise could not be sailed to Hawaii .
Over 50 designs were considered for the Fountain of Youth , with the final one representing a temple built by an ancient civilization around the Fountain , which itself was located in a round rocky structure to represent " the circle of life " .
The locations leading up to the Fountain were shot in the Hawaiian islands of Kauai and Oahu , but the Fountain itself was built at the 007 Stage on Pinewood .
EFFECTS Section::::Effects .
On Stranger Tides employed 1,112 shots of computer - generated imagery , which were done by ten visual effects companies .
Cinesite visual effects supervisor Simon Stanley - Clamp claimed that the most difficult part was doing the effects in 3D : " Rotoscoping is tricky .
Cleaning up plates is double the work , and tracking has to be spot on .
"
The lead companies , with over 300 effects each , were Industrial Light & Magic — responsible for , among others , the mermaids and most water effects — and Moving Picture Company , who created digital ships and environment extensions , such as changing weather and designing cliffs and waterfalls .
Filming the mermaids involved eight model - actresses , who portrayed them outside the water , as well as 22 synchronized swimming athletes and a group of stuntwomen , both of whom wore motion capture suits to be later replaced by digital mermaids .
Mermaid corpses were depicted by plaster models .
The design tried to avoid the traditional representations of mermaids in paintings and literature , instead going for a scaly body with a translucent membrane inspired by both jellyfish and the fabric employed in ballet tutus .
To make the mermaids more menacing underwater , the faces of the actresses had some digital touch - ups on the underwater scenes , adding sharper teeth and a shimmery fish scale quality on the skin .
ILM also handled Blackbeard 's death , where Ian McShane 's actual performance was covered by digital doubles which turned him into a " boiling mass of blood and clothing " , and a hurricane - like formation that represented " the waters of the Fountain taking his life " .
Cinesite handled the recreation of London and Barbossa 's peg leg , CIS Hollywood did 3D corrections and minor shots , and Method Studios created matte paintings .
MUSIC Section::::Music .
The film 's score was written by Hans Zimmer , who had worked in all of the previous entries in the franchise ; being the main composer for the second and third installments .
Zimmer said that he tried to incorporate a rock n ' roll sound , as he felt " pirates were the rock ' n ' rollers of many , many years ago " , and Spanish elements , which led to a collaboration with Mexican guitarists Rodrigo y Gabriela and a tango song written by Penélope Cruz 's brother Eduardo .
American composer Eric Whitacre contributed several choir - based cues , as well as regular assistant Geoff Zanelli .

"

Roger Ebert gave On Stranger Tides two out of four stars , saying that although the removal of Knightley and Bloom as well as the addition of Cruz were positive aspects , the film in general was " too much of a muchness " for him .
Tom Long of The Detroit News gave a D+ , saying that Jack Sparrow had " worn out his welcome " .
Despite the more linear plot , " the movie is still ridiculous " .
He found On Stranger Tides to be " precisely what you 'd expect of the fourth installment of a movie based on an amusement park ride : a whole lot of noise , plenty of stunts and complete silliness . "
British film critic Mark Kermode gave the film an overwhelmingly negative review on his 5 Live show , saying " it 's not as staggeringly misjudged as the third part , because it is just nothing , it is just a big empty nothing , whereas part three I think was an active atrocity , it 's just nothing at all " .
As with the previous films , the plot was criticized as incoherent and confusing .
The Arizona Republic critic Bill Goodykoontz rated the film two out of five , stating that " the movie is a series of distractions tossed together in the hopes that they will come together in a coherent story .
That never really happens .
" Online reviewer James Berardinelli considered the script " little more than a clothesline from which to dangle all of the obligatory set pieces " , and USA Todays Claudia Puig found On Stranger Tides " familiar and predictable ... often incoherent and crammed with pointless details . "
Mike Scott from The Times - Picayune mentions that " while this latest chapter is n't quite sharp enough to restore the sense of discovery that made that first outing so darn exciting , it 's enough to make up for most of the missteps that made the third one so darn arrgh - inducing .
" Writing for The A.V. Club , Tasha Robinson described On Stranger Tides as " a smaller film than past installments , by design and necessity " , and felt that " the series has needed this streamlining " as the film " feels lightweight , but that 's still better than bloated . "
On Stranger Tides also had positive reviews ; some critics found the film to be entertaining and well - made .
Richard Roeper gave the film a B+ , describing it as " the most fun installment since the first " , calling the story " pure cartoon , but a lot easier to follow than the other sequels " , and summing as " the franchise is getting tired , but Penelope energizes it . "
Along the same lines , Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film three out of four stars , writing that it " feels as fresh and bracingly exhilarating as the day Jack Sparrow first swashed his buckle , infusing new reckless energy into a franchise that shows no signs of furling its sails " .
She said that Marshall " swiftly and without fuss delivers the action set pieces and eye - popping escapism " and praised Depp , Cruz , and McShane 's performances .
Ray Bennett from The Hollywood Reporter considered that Marshall " shows terrific flair with all the usual chases and sword fights , and he handles the 3D well " , and welcomed Penélope Cruz 's character , saying she " brings her Oscar - winning vivacity " and had " lively sexual tension " with Depp .
Writing for The Globe and Mail , Rick Groen found the action scenes to range from " merely competent to tritely cluttered " , but he was pleased with the overall result , calling McShane a " fresh villain " whose " stentorian tones are welcome anywhere " .
Variety 's Andrew Barker considered the film derivative , but accessible .
" It has nary an original idea and still does n't make much sense , but it 's lost all pretensions that it should " .
He praised Geoffrey Rush , stating that he " not only gets the funniest lines and reaction shots , but also starts to siphon away much of the roguish charm that used to be Depp 's stock and trade . "
