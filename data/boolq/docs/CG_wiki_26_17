ARRECTOR PILI
MUSCLE
The arrector pili muscles are small muscles attached to hair follicles in mammals .
Contraction of these muscles causes the hairs to stand on end , known colloquially as goose bumps .
Each arrector pili is composed of a bundle of smooth muscle fibres which attach to several follicles ( a follicular unit ) , and is innervated by the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system .
The contraction of the muscle is then involuntary â€“ stresses such as cold , fear etc .
may stimulate the sympathetic nervous system , and thus cause contraction .
Contraction of the muscles has a number of different purposes .
Its principal function in the majority of mammals is to provide insulation : air becomes trapped between the erect hairs , helping the animal retain heat .
Erection of the porcupine 's long , thick hairs causes the animal to become more intimidating , scaring predators .
Pressure exerted by the muscle may cause sebum to be forced along the hair follicle towards the surface , protecting the hair .
