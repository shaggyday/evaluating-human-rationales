FAKE FIELD GOAL
A fake field goal is a trick play in American football .
Simply , it involves a running or passing play done out of a kick formation .
Usually the holder ( often the punter or backup quarterback on most teams ) will throw or run .
Danny White was both quarterback and punter for the Dallas Cowboys in the 1980s and often executed this play .
Less frequently , the placekicker , who virtually never handles the ball in an American football game , will serve as the passer or rusher on a fake field goal .
Examples include then - New England
kicker Adam Vinatieri receiving a direct snap and throwing a touchdown pass during an NFL game in 2004 , and LSU kicker Colt David rushing for a 15-yard touchdown in 2007 after receiving the ball on a blind lateral from holder ( and starting quarterback )
Matt Flynn .
