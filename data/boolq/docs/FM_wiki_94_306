STATEMENT ( LOGIC )
In logic , the term statement is variously understood to mean either :
In the latter case , a statement is distinct from a sentence in that a sentence is only one formulation of a statement , whereas there may be many other formulations expressing the same statement .
OVERVIEW Section::::Overview .
Philosopher of language , Peter Strawson advocated the use of the term " statement " in sense ( b ) in preference to proposition .
Strawson used the term " Statement " to make the point that two declarative sentences can make the same statement if they say the same thing in different ways .
Thus in the usage advocated by Strawson , " All men are mortal . "
and " Every man is mortal .
" are two different sentences that make the same statement .
In either case a statement is viewed as a truth bearer .
Examples of sentences that are ( or make ) statements : *
" Socrates is a man . "
* " A triangle has three sides . "
*
" Madrid is the capital of Spain . " Examples of sentences that are not ( or do not make ) statements : * " Who are you ? "
* " Run ! "
* " Greenness perambulates . "
* " I had one grunch but the eggplant over there . "
* " The King of France is wise . "
*
" Broccoli tastes good . "
* " Pegasus exists . "
The first two examples are not declarative sentences and therefore are not ( or do not make ) statements .
The third and fourth are declarative sentences but , lacking meaning , are neither true nor false and therefore are not ( or do not make ) statements .
The fifth and sixth examples are meaningful declarative sentences , but are not statements but rather matters of opinion or taste .
Whether or not the sentence " Pegasus exists .
" is a statement is a subject of debate among philosophers .
Bertrand Russell held that it is a ( false ) statement .
Strawson held it is not a statement at all .
AS
AN ABSTRACT ENTITY Section::::As an abstract entity .
In some treatments " statement " is introduced in order to distinguish a sentence from its informational content .
A statement is regarded as the information content of an information - bearing sentence .
Thus , a sentence is related to the statement it bears like a numeral to the number it refers to .
Statements are abstract logical entities , while sentences are grammatical entities .
