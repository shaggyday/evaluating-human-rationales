HISTORY Section::::History .
The first Yale lacrosse team was fielded in 1882 and joined the Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association the following year .
The 1978 varsity team , coached by Bob McHenry , backed by the strong defensive efforts of John " Sandy " MacMullen , Mike Burns and Captain Brad Gano , and fueled offensively by Andy Murr , Mike Cromwell , John Piazza , Courtney Whitney , Mike Corcoran , Kevin Connolly and Brian Matthews , among others , was one of Yale 's most colorful and exciting teams to watch in action .
Their record suffered , however , as the hotly recruited center midfielder , Todd " Tedious " LaRoche ( ' 78 ) , high scorer for Roger Ludlowe 's varsity lacrosse team in 1974 , did not play beyond his freshman year at Yale .
LaRoche was the only player in Ludlowe history to score three consecutive single - handed goals from the face - off .
Yale has made six appearances in the NCAA tournament since its establishment in 1971 .
Their first appearance was in 1988 , when they were eliminated in double overtime by Virginia , 10–9 .
In 1990 , Yale earned a first - round bye , and then defeated Princeton , 17–9 , for their first NCAA tournament win .
The Bulldogs fell in the semifinals to Loyola , 14–13 in double overtime .
Yale returned to the NCAA tournament in 1992 , advancing through the first round with a win against Navy , 9–3 , before being eliminated by Syracuse , 17–8 .
Yale finished the 2010 season with a 10–4 record , but an Ivy League tournament semifinal loss to Princeton and a weak RPI kept them out of the NCAA field .
The team finished the season ranked 18th in the Nike / Inside Lacrosse Men 's Division I Media Poll .
