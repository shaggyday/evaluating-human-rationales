UCLA BRUINS FOOTBALL
The UCLA Bruins football program represents the University of California , Los Angeles , in college football as members of the Pac-12 Conference at the NCAA Division I FBS level .
The Bruins have enjoyed several periods of success in their history , having been ranked in the top ten of the AP Poll at least once in every decade since the poll began in the 1930s .
Their first major period of success came in the 1950s , under head coach Henry Russell Sanders .
Sanders led the Bruins to the Coaches ' Poll national championship in 1954 , three conference championships , and an overall record of 66–19–1 in nine years .
In the 1980s and 1990s , during the tenure of Terry Donahue , the Bruins compiled a 151–74–8 record , including 13 bowl games and an NCAA record eight straight bowl wins .
The program has produced 28 first round picks in the NFL Draft , 30 consensus All - Americans , and multiple major award winners , including Heisman winner Gary Beban .
The UCLA Bruins ' main rival is the USC Trojans .
Chip Kelly became head coach in 2018 .
The Bruins were the Pac-12 Conference South Division champions for two years in a row and played Pac-12 Football Championship Games in both 2011 and 2012 .

Section::::Early history ( 1919–1948 ) .
The first football team fielded by UCLA took the field in 1919 .
The team was coached by Fred Cozens , and compiled a 2–6 record .
UCLA did not participate in an athletic conference until 1920 , so the 1919 football team played a schedule full of local high schools and other assorted teams .
Cozens was UCLA 's athletics director from 1919 to 1942 .
Harry Trotter took over the young UCLA football program after Cozens stepped down after guiding the Bruins in their first season .
UCLA began to play in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference ( SCIAC ) in 1920 , and competed against Occidental College , California Institute of Technology , University of Redlands , Whittier College , and Pomona College .
Coach Trotter 's two wins were against Redlands and San Diego State , which did not join the SCIAC until 1926 .
Trotter left UCLA with a 2–13–1 record in three seasons ( 1920–1922 ) .
James J. Cline took over the Bruins football program as its third head coach in 1923 .
Coach Cline 's two wins were against Loyola University and San Diego State .
Cline was replaced after two seasons and a 2–10–3 record .
William H. Spaulding came to UCLA from Minnesota in 1925 .
As the Bruins head coach , his overall record in fourteen seasons was 72–51–8 .
During his tenure in Los Angeles , Spaulding led the Bruins to their first bowl appearance and victory , the 1938 Poi Bowl .
Also during Spaulding 's tenure , the Bruins left the SCIAC and joined the Pacific Coast Conference beginning in 1928 .
Spaulding 's 72 wins rank him among the best in head coaching victories in Bruin football history .
He retired after a successful fourteen - season tenure ended after the 1938 season .
Edwin C. Horrell was promoted to head coach following Spaulding 's retirement .
His 1942 UCLA Bruins team lost to Georgia in the 1943 Rose Bowl .
He was the first coach to lead a UCLA team to defeat rival USC .
It was the first football victory in the UCLA – USC rivalry .
The most notable player who played for Horrell at UCLA was Jackie Robinson , who went on to a Hall of Fame career in professional baseball .
Horrell 's 1939 team compiled a 6–0–4 and his 1941 team posted a 5–5–1 record .
With the exception of the 1942 season , the combined record of the Bruins during Horrell 's tenure outside the aforementioned seasons was 6–22–1 .
These struggles led to Horrell 's firing after six seasons at the helm of UCLA football .
coach Bert LaBrucherie was hired by his alma mater to replace Horrell .
LaBrucherie 's overall record at UCLA was 23–16 .
In his second year as head coach , the Bruins were Pacific Coast Conference champions , but lost to Illinois in the Rose Bowl .
LaBrucherie 's Bruins only posted one losing season during his four seasons , a 3–7 1948 season in what turned out to be his final season .
LaBrucherie accepted the position of head football coach at California Institute of Technology after the 1948 season , departing UCLA .
HENRY SANDERS ERA ( 1949–1957 ) Section::::Henry Sanders era ( 1949–1957 ) .
Henry Sanders came to UCLA from Vanderbilt .
He was arguably the best coach in school history , with an overall record of 66–19–1 ( ) at UCLA and earned the school its only national championship in football in 1954 .
As head coach of the Bruins , Sanders led them to three Pacific Coast Conference ( PCC ) titles , two Rose Bowls ( 1953 and 1955 seasons ) and to a 6–3 record over arch - rival USC .
Sanders instituted the distinctive football uniforms worn by the Bruins when he replaced the navy blue jerseys with " baking powderkeg blue " , added the shoulder stripe to give the impression of motion , and changed the number style from block to clarendon .
Sanders said these changes were made to make it easier to see his Bruins on the grainy black and white game films of the time .
The 1954 Bruins compiled a 9–0 record and climbed to the top of the Coaches ' Poll , sharing the national championship with Ohio State , winner of the AP Poll 's title .
Due to the PCC 's early " no repeat " rule , the undefeated Bruins were unable to compete in the Rose Bowl that season despite being the PCC champion .
Second - place USC , who the Bruins beat 34–0 , played in the 1955 Rose Bowl instead and lost to Big Ten Conference champion and eventual co - national champion Ohio State , 20–7 .
Henry Sanders was also known for intensifying the Bruins ' rivalry with USC .
His teams were always given a speech before the game against their cross - town rivals that always ended with " Beat SC ! "
A famous quote was attributed to Sanders regarding the rivalry , " Beating ' SC is n't a matter of life and death .
It 's more important than that . "
Shortly before the 1958 season was set to begin , coach Sanders suffered a heart attack and died in a Los Angeles hotel .
Assistant coach George W. Dickerson took over the Bruins on an interim basis before suffering a nervous breakdown .
Then , a full - time head coach was hired .
For his successes , he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1996 .
WILLIAM BARNES ERA ( 1958–1964 ) Section::::William Barnes era ( 1958–1964 ) .
William F. Barnes was the head coach for the UCLA Bruins football team for seven seasons .
He guided his teams to a 31–34–3 ( .478 ) record .
He did have two seven - win seasons in 1960 and 1961 , leading the Bruins to the 1962 Rose Bowl .
That year , the Bruins finished the season ranked # 16 in the final AP poll .
Barnes resigned after the 1964 season after learning that athletics director J.D. Morgan was not going to renew his contract .
TOMMY PROTHRO ERA ( 1965–1970 )
Section::::Tommy Prothro era ( 1965–1970 ) .
On January 11 , 1965 , Tommy Prothro was hired away from Oregon State as head coach of the UCLA Bruins .
In the 1965 football season , the Bruins lost their season opening game 13–3 at Michigan State , who then rose to become the top - ranked team in the country .
The unheralded Bruins would go on a seven - game undefeated streak , surprising national powers the likes of Syracuse and Penn State .
Going into the 1965 UCLA – USC rivalry football game ranked # 7 , the conference championship and 1966 Rose Bowl were on the line .
# 6 USC , led by Heisman Trophy winner Mike Garrett led 16–6 until UCLA got a touchdown on a pass from Gary Beban to Dick Witcher with four minutes to play .
After the two - point conversion made it 16–14 , UCLA recovered an onside kick .
Beban then hit Kurt Altenberg on a 50-yard bomb and UCLA won , 20–16 .
Integrated UCLA then faced all - white Tennessee in the newly built Liberty Bowl stadium in Memphis , Prothro 's native city .
On the last play of the game , Tennessee defensive back Bob Petrella intercepted a UCLA pass to save a Volunteer win by a score of 37–34 .
Tennessee 's winning drive was aided by a controversial pass interference call , the clock had questionably stopped twice , and a dropped pass that appeared to be a lateral was recovered by UCLA , but was later ruled an incomplete forward pass .
After the game , Prothro stated , " For the first time in my life , I am ashamed to be a Southerner . "
Prothro and the Bruins went on to completed the season with a dramatic pay - back upset victory over the # 1 ranked Michigan State Spartans in the 1966 Rose Bowl , 14–12 .
This victory over the much stronger Spartans perpetuated the legend of the " Gutty little Bruins . "
Heading into the final game of the 1966 season vs. USC , UCLA was 2–1 in conference games , 8–1 overall and ranked # 5 in the country .
The Bruins , featuring a " dream backfield " of All - Americans Gary Beban and Mel Farr , lost only one game , at rainy Washington , 16–3 , where Huskies ' head coach Jim Owens had devoted his entire season to beating Prothro .
UCLA had beaten UW the season before , 28–24 , with Prothro 's trick play , the Z - streak in which a receiver trots towards the sideline like he 's going out of the game and then runs a streak pattern unguarded by the inattentive defender .
USC was 4–0 in conference and 7–1 overall , having lost to unranked Miami .
The Bruins and Trojans played a different number of conference due to uneven scheduling caused by new AAWU members Oregon and Oregon State and schedules made years in advance .
It was widely assumed that only losses would be considered and the winner of the 1966 UCLA - USC game would go to the 1967 Rose Bowl .
UCLA star quarterback Gary Beban broke his ankle the week before in a win over Stanford , but backup Norman Dow , making his first and only start at quarterback , led UCLA to a 14–7 win .
That left USC with a 4–1 conference record ( 7–2 overall ) and # 5 UCLA with a 3–1 conference record ( 9–1 ) overall .
Due to their win over USC , it was widely assumed UCLA would get the Rose Bowl berth .
However , a vote the next Monday among the AAWU conference athletic directors awarded USC the Rose Bowl berth .
It was speculated that the directors believed Beban could not play for UCLA in the Rose Bowl due to the broken ankle , thereby giving the Big Ten Conference representative , Purdue , a better chance to win .
As it turned out , Beban could have played .
But a bigger reason was that this was to make up for 1964 when Oregon State was voted in ahead of USC .
The coach of Oregon State in 1964 was Prothro .
Another speculation was the vote was against UCLA out of pure jealousy by the rest of the conference , which voted 7–1 for the clearly inferior team .
This vote deprived Prothro of being the first coach to earn three consecutive Rose Bowl berths and UCLA athletic director J.D. Morgan called it a " gross injustice " and the " a dark day in UCLA and AAWU Athletic history . "
Inflamed UCLA students who had gathered for the Rose Bowl celebration rally , took to the streets of Westwood in protest and actually blocked the 405 Freeway for a short time .
Ironically , Morgan was the force behind establishing a tie - breaking method adopted by the conference one year later in which only loss column counted ; the first tiebreaker was head - to - head results , followed by overall record .
If there was still a tie , the Rose Bowl berth would go to the team that had not played in the Rose Bowl the longest .
But it was too late for UCLA .
In their final game , USC made the AAWU decision look bad by losing to No . 1
Notre Dame , 51–0 .
They went on to lose the Rose Bowl as well to Purdue , 14–13 , finishing the season at 7–4 .
In 1967 , Prothro helped a second quarterback capture the Heisman Trophy when Gary Beban was awarded the trophy after the regular season .
He would bring his # 1 ranked UCLA Bruin team to face # 2 USC in one of the " Games of the Century " .
Despite playing with cracked ribs , Beban threw for 301 yards , but UCLA lost , 21–20 , on a spectacular 64-yard run by O. J. Simpson in the 1967 USC vs. UCLA football game .
Another big factor was UCLA 's acclaimed sophomore kicker Zenon Andusyshyn missing a chip shot field goal , and having two field goals and an extra point attempt blocked .
In what was acknowledged to be a rebuilding year , the Bruins opened the 1968 season with a 63–7 defeat of Pittsburgh and a win over Washington State .
The season ground to a halt at Syracuse and with the season - ending injury of quarterback Billy Bolden , and UCLA would win only one more game , over Stanford 20–17 .
The Bruins gave # 1 USC and Heisman Trophy winner O. J. Simpson
a scare in a 28–16 loss ; UCLA trailed 21–16 late in the fourth quarter and had the ball inside USC 's 10-yard line , but USC recovered a fumble and then used almost all of the remaining time in driving for their insurance touchdown .
1969 was the year Prothro had geared his recruiting efforts towards as he believed this was his best team and was capable of contending for the national championship .
The Bruins , quarterbacked by a sensational Junior College transfer Dennis Dummit discovered by Prothro , were undefeated until they faced # 10 Stanford in Palo Alto .
Once again , Prothro was let down by now senior kicker Zenon Andrusyshyn as he missed a short field goal late in the game with the score tied 20–20 .
Suddenly , two long Jim Plunkett passes had Stanford in field goal range in the final seconds , but UCLA blocked Steve Horowitz 's attempt to preserve the tie .
Once again , the UCLA - USC game would decide the Pac-8 title and the 1970 Rose Bowl berth .
UCLA was ranked 6th with a 5–0–1 record in conference and 8–0–1
overall USC was # 5 and was 6–0 in conference and 8–0–1 overall ( tied Notre Dame in South Bend , 14–14 ) ; UCLA and USC were both unbeaten coming into their rivalry game for the first time since 1952 .
UCLA scored midway through the fourth quarter to take a 12–7 lead ( knowing he need a win and not a tie to advance to the Rose Bowl , Prothro had the Bruins go for two after each touchdown and each attempt failed ) .
USC then drove to the winning touchdown with 1:38 to play to win 14–12 .
The Trojans were aided by two controversial calls ; the first was a dubious pass interference call on UCLA 's Danny Graham on a 4th - and-10 incompletion .
Secondly , on the winning touchdown pass reception , USC receiver Sam Dickerson appeared to be either out of bounds , out of the back of the end zone , or both .
This loss supposedly was harder for Prothro to take than the 1967 loss and the freak officiating calls resembled the debacle at Tennessee in 1965 .
In what turned out to be his final season at UCLA , Prothro 's team suffered a rash of key injuries and finished 6–5 , yet they were three close games from a 9–2 season and Rose Bowl berth .
Before those injuries set in , UCLA took a 3–0 record into Austin to play defending national champ and top ranked Texas .
Trailing 13–3 at the half , UCLA rallied and had a 17–13 lead in the final minute .
But with 12 seconds left , Texas completed a long pass when their receiver caught the ball between two UCLA defenders , who then collided , allowing the receiver to score .
UCLA also blew a 20-point fourth quarter lead against Oregon , when Ducks sophomore quarterback Dan Fouts rallied his team to three touchdowns and a 41–40 win .
Finally , there came the showdown with Stanford ; the game was expected to be a shootout between UCLA quarterback Dennis Dummit and Heisman winner Jim Plunkett .
But the defenses ruled as UCLA took a 7–6 lead into the 4th quarter .
Stanford took a 9–7 lead on a field goal , but UCLA was driving to a potential game - winning field goal or touchdown themselves when they completed a pass inside the Stanford 10-yard - line , only to have the receiver get sandwiched by two defenders on the tackle and fumble .
This game ultimately decided the Pac-8 championship and 1971 Rose Bowl representative .
The season ended on a high note however , when UCLA beat rival USC , 45–20 , in a game that was not that close .
This would end up being Prothro 's final game at UCLA .
Prothro was frustrated by bizarre officiating at critical moments , numerous last minute narrow losses , and losing out of the Rose Bowl by the conference vote in 1966 .
Prothro also decried the Pac-8 rule that only allowed the conference champion to go to a bowl game ; he witnessed many lower ranked inferior teams from the Big Eight , Southeastern and Southwest conferences ( often ones he defeated during the season )
go to bowl games while his Bruins stayed home .
After George Allen was fired by the Los Angeles Rams , Prothro accepted that job , leaving the Bruins after six seasons and a 41–18–3 record .
Prothro was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1991 .
PEPPER RODGERS ERA ( 1971–1973 )
Section::::Pepper Rodgers era ( 1971–1973 ) .
Pepper Rodgers came to UCLA from Kansas after the departure of Prothro .
In Rodgers ' three seasons at the helm of the Bruins , UCLA finished 2–7–1 , 8–3 and 9–2 .
In 1972 , the Bruins began the season with a 20–17 victory over two - time defending national champion Nebraska , and finished the season ranked # 17 and # 15 in the final Coaches ' and AP polls , respectively .
In 1973 , the Bruins finished ranked # 9 and # 12 in the final Coaches ' and AP polls , respectively .
Rodgers surprised UCLA fans , players and administration by deciding to accept the head football coach position at his alma mater , Georgia Tech after the 1973 season .
He left the Bruins after compiling a 19–12–1 overall record .
DICK VERMEIL ERA ( 1974–1975 ) Section::::Dick Vermeil era ( 1974–1975 ) .
As head coach at UCLA , Dick Vermeil compiled a 15–5–3 record in two seasons ( 1974–1975 ) , including a 9–2–1 record in 1975 when he led the Bruins to their first conference championship in 10 years , and a win in the Rose Bowl over undefeated and number 1 ranked Ohio State .
Vermeil won Pac-8 Coach of the Year honors in 1975 .
Vermeil became the second out of three UCLA head coaches ( and third in a row to leave UCLA for another job ) to leave for the NFL when he accepted on offer to become head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles .
His final record as head coach of the Bruins is 15–5–3 .
TERRY DONAHUE ERA ( 1976–1995 ) Section::::Terry Donahue era ( 1976–1995 ) .
Terry Donahue was promoted from assistant coach to head coach of the Bruins football team following Vermeil 's departure .
Donahue has the most conference wins of any head coach in Pacific-10 Conference history ( 98 ) and also the most wins in UCLA football history ( 151 ) .
His teams compiled a record of 8–4–1 in bowl games and were the first to win a bowl game in seven consecutive seasons .
Donahue 's UCLA teams won or shared five Pacific-10 Conference championships and won three Rose Bowls ( 1983 , 1984 , and 1986 ) .
Donahue 's record was 10–9–1 against USC in the UCLA – USC rivalry .
His teams won four New Year 's Day bowl games in a row from 1983 to 1986 .
Donahue retired from coaching after twenty seasons and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 2000 .
His final record is 151–74–8 .
BOB TOLEDO ERA ( 1996–2002 ) Section::::Bob Toledo era ( 1996–2002 ) .
Bob Toledo was promoted from offensive coordinator to head coach of the Bruins after Donahue 's retirement .
In 1996 , his first season as head coach , the Bruins finished with a 5–6 record .
The highlight of the season was a comeback win over USC .
The 1997 team finished as co - champions of the Pacific-10 Conference with Washington State .
However , with Washington State defeating the Bruins in the season opener , the Cougars earned the right to play in the Rose Bowl .
The highlights of that season were a 66–3 win over the Texas and a victory at the Cotton Bowl Classic over Texas A&M , and a victory over USC .
The 1998 season started out as one of the best in the history of UCLA football .
The team was high enough in the BCS standings to merit entry to the national championship game , and all UCLA needed to do was beat unranked University of Miami , who were major underdogs after a 66–13 loss to Syracuse the week before .
UCLA was also coming off of their eighth consecutive victory over USC and 20th straight win overall .
However , Miami won 49–45 , ending UCLA 's chances of playing in the national championship game .
They instead settled for a trip to the Rose Bowl as Pac-10 champions , but lost to Wisconsin .
This is seen as the turning point for the UCLA football program .
The 1999 season was a major disappointment , with the team finishing 4–7 .
This was the first year that USC had defeated them in the annual Battle for the Victory Bell since 1990 .
The year also had the dubious distinction of a 55–7 loss to Pac-10 foe Oregon State , the worst defeat of the Bruins in 69 years .
In 2000 , the Bruins finished 6–6 with a loss in the Sun Bowl , again against Wisconsin .
The 2001 season started with promise as the Bruins got off to a fast start with a 6–0 record .
However , four straight losses to Stanford , Washington State , Oregon , and USC , the Bruins faded out of postseason contention .
UCLA finished off 8–5 in Toledo 's final season in 2002 .
The team finished 7–5 in the regular season , but Toledo was fired after a fourth straight loss to USC .
The Bruins did reach the Las Vegas Bowl and interim coach Ed Kezirian coached — and won — his only game in charge of the program .
Toledo finished with a record of 49–32 , for a winning percentage of .605 , including one winning streak of 20 consecutive victories , a school record .
Toledo 's greatest accomplishment with the team may have been in the 1997 season , where the team finished 10–2 with a victory over Texas A&M in the Cotton Bowl Classic .
Toledo 's Bruins were 3–4 against UCLA 's cross - town archrival , the USC Trojans .
KARL DORRELL ERA ( 2003–2007 )
Section::::Karl Dorrell era ( 2003–2007 ) .
Longtime college and NFL assistant Karl Dorrell was brought in to revive the glory of the UCLA football program , his alma mater , after Toledo was fired .
Dorrell also was brought in to UCLA to clean up a program marred by off - the - field problems in the final years of Bob Toledo 's tenure .
He was the first African American head football coach in UCLA football history .
Dorrell 's UCLA Bruins team recorded a mark of 6–7 in his first season as head coach in 2003 , with an appearance in the Silicon Valley Bowl , and a loss to Fresno State .
In 2004 , his second season , the team finished with a record of 6–6 an appearance in the Las Vegas Bowl , with a loss to Wyoming .
In 2005 , his third season as head football coach , Dorrell was able get his first win against a ranked opponent , No . 21 Oklahoma , featuring Adrian Peterson .
On October 1 , 2005 , head coach Tyrone Willingham and his Washington Huskies came to the Rose Bowl for a Pacific-10 Conference game to play UCLA .
This was the first time two black head coaches faced each other in a Pac-10 conference game .
At the time , Sylvester Croom of Mississippi State was the only other black coach heading an NCAA Division I football program .
Dorrell achieved his first win against a top - ten opponent with a 47–40 upset win over No . 10-ranked rival California .
Three Bruin wins in the 2005 season
set new school records for biggest comebacks earning the nickname " The Cardiac Kids .
" They came thanks largely to the heroics of quarterback Drew Olson and tailback Maurice Jones - Drew .
In the regular season the Bruins came from down 21 points to win in overtime against both Washington State and Stanford .
In the Stanford comeback , the Bruins scored 21 points in the final 7:04 of the fourth quarter .
In the Sun Bowl , the Bruins set the record again by coming back from 22 points down .
The Bruins were ranked No . 7 in the nation until a 52–14 blowout loss to a 3–8 Arizona team .
The Bruins came into the UCLA –
USC rivalry
last regular season game ranked No . 11 .
They suffered a 66–19 defeat to the No . 1 2005 USC Trojans football team .
This was the largest margin of defeat since the series began in 1929 with a 76–0 defeat .
The Bruins finished third in the Pac-10 standings .
On December 30 , 2005 his Bruins defeated the Northwestern Wildcats in the Sun Bowl , 50–38 , finishing the season with a 10–2 record .
At the end of the 2005 season , Dorrell received pay bonuses for coaching successful seasons .
He was named Pac-10 co - coach of the year along with USC head coach Pete Carroll .
In 2006 , Dorrell 's fourth season , the Bruins finished the season 7–6 ( 5–4 in conference ) and finished fourth - place in the Pac-10 .
UCLA played its first game at the University of Notre Dame since the 1960s and was leading 17–13 , but the Irish scored a touchdown in the final minute to win .
The most notable victory of his coaching career at UCLA was a 13–9 defeat of
No . 2-ranked and Bowl Championship Series title - game - bound USC on December 2 , 2006 .
The win kept the Trojans out of the title game and broke a seven - game UCLA losing streak to the Trojans , thereby preserving the Bruins ' eight - game win streak over USC from 1991 to 1998 as the longest run in the history of the rivalry .
The victory also clinched a winning season for UCLA .
The Bruins played in the Emerald Bowl in San Francisco against a Bobby Bowden - coached Florida State team on December 27 , 2006 and lost , 44–27 .
In Dorrell 's fifth season at UCLA , with 20 returning starters and a team of his own recruits , hopes were high for the Bruins in 2007 .
After starting the season with a couple of wins over Stanford and BYU , and achieving a No . 11 AP Poll ranking , however , UCLA stumbled against an injured , winless , and unranked Utah team , 44–6 .
Four weeks later , Dorrell 's Bruins fell again ; this time 20–6 to an unranked , winless Notre Dame team .
The Bruins did , however , post wins against seemingly more difficult Pac-10 opponents , including a No . 10 Cal team .
However ; the bad taste of losses to teams the Bruins were favored to beat ( including an embarrassing 27–7 loss to Washington State )
raised questions about Dorrell 's play - calling and ability to motivate his players .
After the Washington State loss , UCLA Athletic Director Dan Guerrero addressed UCLA 's inconsistent football performances for the first time , stating " I will be very interested to see how we finish the season .
And you can use that . "
Many took this as a hint that Dorrell 's job might be in serious jeopardy .
The Bruins would go on to lose to Arizona and Arizona State by a combined score of 58–47 , but surprisingly shut out an Oregon Ducks team that a week earlier lost starting quarterback and Heisman Trophy Candidate Dennis Dixon to a knee injury .
Heading into the final game of the regular season against crosstown - rival USC , the Bruins still had an outside chance at a Rose Bowl berth that might have saved Dorrell 's job ; with a victory over USC and some help from Arizona ( with a win over ASU ) , the Bruins could have been the first - ever five - loss team to play in the Rose Bowl .
It was n't to be , however , and the Bruins finished the 2007 Regular season with a miserable offensive performance in a 24–7 loss to USC and a record of 6–6 .
On December 3 , 2007 , Los Angeles papers and the Associated Press reported that Karl Dorrell was fired during a meeting with athletic director Dan Guerrero .
Dorrell was offered the choice , but decided not to coach in the Las Vegas Bowl .
Defensive coordinator DeWayne Walker served as interim coach for the game , where UCLA lost to BYU .
RICK NEUHEISEL ERA ( 2008–2011 ) Section::::Rick Neuheisel era ( 2008–2011 ) .
On December 29 , 2007 , Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator Rick Neuheisel , formerly head coach at Colorado and Washington , was brought back to his alma mater and hired as UCLA 's 15th head football coach after his former Bruins teammate Dorrell was fired .
Neuheisel coined the phrase " Passion Bucket " during an interview on The Dan Patrick Show by saying , " When you 're at UCLA , you have to have your passion bucket full when you play the Trojans . "
Neuheisel had his first win on September 1 as the Bruins ' head coach as they defeated # 18 Tennessee , 27–24 .
The win came in overtime as Tennessee 's field goal try sailed wide left .
However , the team 's momentum came to a halt in successive weeks .
A brutal 59–0 defeat on the road at the hands of # 15 BYU was followed by a disappointing 31–10 loss at home to unranked Arizona in the Bruins ' Pac-10 opener .
The UCLA offense failed to score a touchdown in either contest .
The team finished the season 4–8 overall and 3–6 in conference .
Despite this record , Neuheisel was still able secure the fifth - best recruiting class in the nation in 2009 as rated by Scout.com .
The class was headlined by Morrell Presley , Randall Carroll , offensive linemen Xavier Sua - Filo and Stan Hasiak , and running back Damien Thigpen .
The 2009 season showed signs of improvement , with a potential bright future ahead , finishing 7–6 with a bowl winover Temple .
The UCLA 2010 recruiting class was strong , as Neuheisel swayed many recruits away from USC .
Nevertheless , the Bruins fell to 4–8 in 2010 , losing six of their last seven games and failing to receive a bowl berth .
Player injuries and other attrition depleted UCLA of its roster depth , while true freshmen were forced into action and seniors who were previously reserves became starters ; a quarterback who had attempted only 17 passes in his career became the starter .
At the end of the season Neuheisel fired two assistant coaches , including Chow , and said he would " be crushed ... if we 're not going to a bowl game a year from now . "
The 2011 season brought about continued mediocre performance , although the team 's record improved to 6–6 in regular season play .
Despite the lackluster overall record , the Bruins won the first Pac-12 South Division title , as crosstown rival USC was ineligible due to NCAA sanctions .
A 50–0 shutout loss to USC to end the regular season — UCLA 's fifth consecutive loss to the Trojans — prompted speculation that Neuheisel would be fired .
Neuheisel was fired as head coach of UCLA on November 28 , 2011 .
He was allowed to coach his final game at the December 2 , Pac-12 Conference football Championship game , where the team lost 49–31 to the Oregon Ducks .
JIM MORA ERA ( 2012–2017 ) Section::::Jim Mora era ( 2012–2017 ) .
On December 10 , 2011 , UCLA athletics director Dan Guerrero announced the hiring of former Atlanta Falcons and Seattle Seahawks head coach , Jim L. Mora , as the Bruins ' 16th head football coach .

Both are within the Los Angeles city limits , approximately apart .
Until 1982 , the two schools also shared the same stadium : the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum .

FACILITIES ROSE BOWL Section::::Facilities .
Section::::Rose Bowl .
The Rose Bowl is a National Historic Landmark located in Pasadena , California with an official capacity of 92,542 .
It has been the home football field for the UCLA Bruins since the 1982 season .
The Bruins had played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum after joining the Pacific Coast Conference in 1928 .
The Coliseum is also the home of the rival USC Trojans .
An on - campus facility was discussed , but faced significant political opposition , including from the governor at the time , Edmund Gerald " Pat " Brown Sr ..
The Bruins had second priority in schedule at the Coliseum after the Trojans , but before the Los Angeles Rams .
A 44,000 seat stadium on campus appeared in the 1963 Long range Plan , at the site where Drake Stadium eventually was built .
However , the proposal was blocked by influential area residents , as well as other politicians .
In addition , the Coliseum already was constructed by and is a facility of the State of California .
When the Oakland Raiders became the Los Angeles Raiders , in 1982 , and after arduous negotiations with the city of Pasadena , UCLA decided to move out of the Coliseum , relocating its home games to the Rose Bowl Stadium .
The Raiders had demanded control of the facility and luxury box revenue at the Coliseum .
UCLA has participated in five Rose Bowl games since moving to the stadium , including the 1983 Rose Bowl at the end of the Bruins ' first season there .
From 1919 to 1927 , the Bruins ( then known as the Cubs ) used Moore Field at the Vermont Ave .
campus of the " Southern Branch of the University of California . " SPAULDING FIELD Section::::Spaulding Field .
The on campus practice facility for the football team is Spaulding Field , which has two football fields , one grass and one artificial turf , or synthetic turf .
Because of space constraints , the Bruins do n't have a complete 100 yard field for practice .
WASSERMAN FOOTBALL CENTER Section::::Wasserman Football Center .
The Wasserman Football Center , built immediately west of Spaulding Field , the football team 's practice field , was dedicated on August 1 , 2017 .
Within the 75,000 square feet structure , there are training and treatment room , weight room , football facilities , the Troy Aikman Strength and Conditioning Center , and locker rooms .
Also located in the center are coaches ' offices , nutrition center , hydrotherapy pools , meeting rooms and the Terry and Andrea Donahue Team Auditorium .
Other amenities include a barbershop , players ' lounge , and recruiting lounge and terrace .
UNIFORMS Section::::Uniforms .
From 2004 - 2017 , the official UCLA athletic colors were " True Blue " and gold .
The " True Blue " is a slightly darker shade than the previous powder blue worn by teams .
In the early days of the school , UCLA had the same colors as the California Golden Bears : Yale Blue and California Gold .
Blue symbolized the ocean , while gold represented the state of California , known as the " Golden State " .
When football coach Red Sanders came to UCLA for the 1949 season he redesigned the football uniforms .
The Yale Blue was changed to a lighter shade of blue .
Sanders figured that the baby blue would look better on the field and in film .
He would dub the baby blue uniform " Powderkeg blue " , powder blue with an explosive kick .
For the 1954 season , Sanders added the now familiar loop on the shoulders , the UCLA Stripe , to give an impression of motion .
The away uniforms became white , with a navy blue and gold shoulder stripe and gold pants .
The helmets became gold .
At times , beginning with the 1954 football season , the font for the numbers on the uniforms has been Clarendon typeface .
Otherwise it has been block numerals .
In the 1980s the uniform pants became yellow to look better in color publications , the jerseys a lighter blue , and the UCLA script was added to the helmets .
In the 1990s , the uniform pants became gold again .
In 2003 , the True Blue colors were adopted .
The away uniforms got true blue shoulder stripes and numbers in 2006 , but were replaced by navy blue again in 2010 .
In 2009 , the Bruins wore a 1967 throwback uniform against Washington and USC , though against USC the team 's normal helmet was worn .
