One year after the disappearance of Alison DiLaurentis , her four friends , Aria Montgomery , Spencer Hastings , Emily Fields , and Hanna Marin , each receive messages from someone calling themselves " A.
" The girls had drifted apart over the year , so they had no idea that other people were getting texts as well .
Additionally , the texts were about secrets only Ali knew about .
At first , the messages were simply teasing and all of the girls wonder if their missing friend was the one who sent them .
Though they knew she was most likely dead , she was still the only one who knew their darkest secrets .
Once Ali 's body is discovered in her old backyard , the girls are even more baffled when they continue to receive threats .
At Ali 's funeral , the girls are reunited and they find out that they 've all been receiving weird messages .

first " A " .
From that point on , the messages take on a distinctly more threatening tone .
Aria is given an ultimatum to tell her mother about her father 's affair by midnight after the Foxy event , or A will do it for her .
A continues to play life - altering games with the girls , from encouraging suspicion of Spencer 's involvement in Ali 's death to outing Emily 's sexuality to her conservative mother .
However , A makes a serious mistake in texting Hanna on the night of Mona 's birthday party .
Instead of using the plain Blackberry she bought just for tormenting the girls , A accidentally uses his / her own phone .
Hanna , who has a new phone without all of her contacts recognizes the number , compelling A to act before Hanna can reveal A 's true identity to the others .
A hits Hanna with an SUV , successfully destroying Hanna 's phone and putting her into a coma that eventually leads to a temporary loss of memory .
Soon after that , " A " puts a drug in Emily 's pain cream which causes an Ulcer in the spot where she has been putting the cream .
She ends up in the hospital and might not be able to swim again .
A knew that there was a very good chance Hanna would regain her memory .
Hanna 's best friend , Mona Vanderwaal , informs the girls that she has also received texts from A , drawing the five closer together in trying to figure out who their tormentor is .
Mona subtly encourages Spencer 's fears that her sister , Melissa , might be A as well as Alison 's killer .
During Hanna 's recovery masquerade celebration , she suddenly regains her memory , revealing that Mona is A.
However , she , Emily , and Aria ca n't do much about it , because Spencer and Mona are on their way to the police station .
After Spencer is warned about Mona by text , she tries to escape Mona 's car , but Mona catches on rather quickly and diverts to a path in a more remote area of Rosewood .
She tells Spencer everything , from seeing Ali launch a firework into Toby Cavanaugh 's garage that blinded her friend Jenna , to finding Ali 's diary of secrets among a pile of old DiLaurentis junk the St. Germains left at the curb , discovering the girls ' secrets that only Ali knew .
Her motivation was to get revenge for her friend 's blindness , even though Jenna and Ali had planned together to launch the firework .
Mona did n't know this and got a scar on her stomach from the ordeal .
Mona also drops the bombshell that Ian Thomas killed Ali , due to Ali 's last diary entry about giving him an ultimatum to break up with Melissa .
She then offers Spencer to become A with her and tell Hanna that she must not be remembering correctly , but she refuses .
The two fight at Floating Man 's Quarry and Spencer accidentally pushes Mona , who falls and has her neck caught between rocks .
THE SECOND " A " * Real identity : Alison DiLaurentis

The girls all get a message from " A , " saying " He had to go .
-A " .
Section::::The second " A " .
However , this Alison is even more twisted than the first ; Ian 's body disappears and the town is largely convinced that it was a hoax .
"
A " even teases Spencer , stating , " Just because I said Ian had to go , it did n't mean he had to die . "
" A " pretends to be Ian , using an IM screenname of USCMidfielderRoxx , a testament to his alma mater and his love for field hockey .
Through this new fake identity , " A " feeds Spencer some interesting information about her family , specifically her father 's affair with Mrs. DiLaurentis and the possibility that Ali is her half sister .

: they force Spencer to focus more on her father 's secret by enabling Spencer 's surrogate mother to scam her and clear out her two million dollar trust fund .
"
A " taunts Aria with pictures of her and her mother 's new love interest in compromising situations .

"
A " lands Hanna in the Preserve at Addison - Stevens , a lush clinic for troubled patients .
" A " sends Emily on a trip to the Amish community in Lancaster to dig up more dirt on Officer Wilden .

"
A " even plants the idea that they killed Ali .
However , when Jenna is found dead in Heartless , " A " plants all of their texts , pictures , etc .
on a random lecherous construction worker .
This is one of the same workers who was involved in building the DiLaurentises ' gazebo when " Alison " was still alive .
The girls believe it is all over now , though the fact that the suspect is such a random person bothers them .
Everyone in Rosewood is shocked when the DiLaurentis 's introduce the existence of a third child , Courtney DiLaurentis .
She is the twin of Alison and was kept in various clinics because she was " ill " .
However , " Courtney " is actually Alison DiLaurentis herself .
She reveals her true identity to each of the girls , hoping to gain their friendship and telling them she never died the night of the sleepover .
She claims that Courtney must have gotten out of the house and ran into the construction worker , who killed her .
Though the girls believe her and are glad to have their friend back , Aria is the most suspicious of her .
It was recently discovered that Courtney liked to pretend to be Ali
and she was n't completely buying her story .
Additionally , Wilden and Melissa are also suspicious of " Courtney " .
Melissa knew about the twins since high school , as their brother Jason confided in her .
He told her they hated each other , but Spencer tells her about " Courtney 's " statements that she and Ali shared everything together . "
Ali 's time is running out , for besides the few people suspicious of her , the police start to say that the construction worker has an alibi and might not be guilty .
Her secret is further endangered when Aria finds and sends in a photo of a reflection of someone spying on the girls during the sleepover .
The reflection is too blurry , but it is clearly a female .
Ali takes Mona 's idea and convinces Spencer that Melissa is the culprit .
Meanwhile , she kidnaps Melissa- who has just figured out the truth- and keeps her in her family 's Poconos home .
She stuffs Melissa in a closet with Ian 's corpse .
On the night of the school 's Valentine dance , Ali convinces the girls to hang out with her at the Poconos home .
They ditch the party and get wasted at her home .
She asks them if she could reenact the night of the sleepover and hypnotize them .
Everyone reluctantly agrees , and minutes later they wake up to find Ali gone and the door of the room locked .
A letter is slid underneath , informing the girls of the horrible truth : The Alison that they had been friends with had been Courtney all along and the real Ali killed her .
Courtney was mentally unsound and wanted to be Ali so badly that she tried to drown her when they were children .
One day , when she was home from the mental institute , Courtney stole Ali 's ring and imitated her when she saw Spencer and the others sneaking into their backyard .
Ali was sent to the new mental institute , the Preserve , in Courtney 's place , and was forced to take her sister 's messed up life .
On the night of the sleepover , she spied on the girls , followed Courtney after her fight with Spencer , and killed her in revenge for taking her perfect life .
She hates the girls for ruining her life and tries to kill them too by boarding up the entire home and setting it on fire .
The girls , including Melissa , manage to escape , but no one knows whether Ali is alive .
It 's hinted that she might be , as Emily hears a faint giggle in the distance as she visits Courtney 's grave in the evening .
