95TH
UNITED STATES CONGRESS
The Ninety - fifth United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government , composed of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives .
It met in Washington , DC from January 3 , 1977 , to January 3 , 1979 , during the final weeks of the administration of U.S. President Gerald Ford and the first two years of the administration of U.S. President Jimmy Carter .
The apportionment of seats in this House of Representatives was based on the Nineteenth Census of the United States in 1970 .
Both chambers had a Democratic majority .
It was the first time either party held a filibuster - proof 60 % super majority in both the Senate and House chambers since the 89th United States Congress in 1965 , and last time until the 111th United States Congress in 2009 .
All three super majorities were Democratic party and also were accompanied by Democratic Presidents .
As of 2018 , this is the most recent Congress to approve an amendment ( the unratified District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment ) to the Constitution .
