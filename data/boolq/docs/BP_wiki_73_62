For purposes of counting " official " SEC team championships in baseball , men 's and women 's basketball , soccer , softball , men 's and women 's tennis , and volleyball , the SEC currently only includes regular season team championships , not tournament championships .
The Gators have won an additional 64 SEC tournament titles in these sports which are not included in Florida 's total of 240 SEC team championships .
BASEBALL Section::::Baseball .
Coach Andy Lopez took over the Gators baseball program in 1994 , one season after leading the Pepperdine Waves to their first College World Series championship .
In 1996 , he coached the Gators to a fifty - win season and a College World Series bid .
By 2000 , the program had seemingly hit a plateau and Lopez was replaced .
Pat McMahon became the Gators ' head coach in 2001 after coaching the Mississippi State Bulldogs .
The Gators ' 2005 baseball season was the most successful to date , with the team winning the SEC title , and earning a place in the College World Series for the fifth time in school history .
The team advanced to the championship round against the Texas Longhorns , ultimately losing two games to none .
Following their 2005 College World Series run , the Gators opened the 2006 season ranked number one in the polls , but struggled to finish 28–28 record ( 10–20 SEC ) , and failed to qualify for the NCAA Regionals .
After missing the NCAA Regionals again in 2007 , McMahon was dismissed .
Former Clemson Tigers associate
head coach Kevin O'Sullivan became the Gators ' new head baseball coach on June 13 , 2007 .
O'Sullivan 's Gator teams showed immediate improvement and the Gators finished the 2008 regular season with a 30–24 record ( 17–13 SEC ) , and received an invitation to the NCAA Regional in Tallahassee .
The 2009 squad finished the regular season with a 38–18 record ( 19–11 SEC ) , won the NCAA Regional in Gainesville , and advanced to the Super Regional before losing to the Southern Mississippi Golden Eagles .
O'Sullivan 's 2010 and 2011 Gators finished their SEC regular season play with identical 22–8 records , won the program 's eleventh and twelfth SEC championships , earned a berth in the College World Series in both years , and advanced to the College World Series final in 2011 before losing to South Carolina two games to none .
The Gators returned to the College World Series in 2012 , 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 .
In June 2017 , Florida won their first College World Series championship , beating LSU two games to none in the best - of - three finals .
The Gators baseball team plays its home games at Alfred A. McKethan Stadium at Perry Field .
MEN 'S BASKETBALL Section::::Men 's basketball .
Florida enjoyed limited success in men 's basketball before the mid-1980s .
Coach Norm Sloan 's Gators were invited to the National Invitation Tournament ( NIT)—only the second time the team had been invited to a post - season tournament .
They returned to the NIT in 1985 and 1986 , and made their first appearance in the NCAA Basketball Tournament in 1987 , when guard Vernon Maxwell led the team to the NCAA Sweet Sixteen .
The Gators received invitations to the NCAA Tournament in 1988 and 1989 , but Sloan was forced to resign at the outset of the 1989–90 season as a result of NCAA infractions .
Coach Lon Kruger brought renewed success , and his Gators reached the NIT final four in 1991–92 .
During the 1993–94 season , Andrew DeClercq and Dametri Hill led the Gators to their first NCAA Tournament Final Four following a dramatic victory over the Connecticut Huskies in the NCAA Regional Final .
Athletic Director Jeremy Foley hired Billy Donovan as Kruger 's replacement in 1996 .
Donovan 's recruiting prowess was evident early , as he landed recruiting classes with future NBA players Mike Miller , Udonis Haslem and Matt Bonner .
Donovan 's Gators advanced to the NCAA Tournament final before losing to the Michigan State Spartans in 2000 , and demonstrated a consistency previously unknown to the program as they received invitations to the NCAA Tournament every year from 1999 through 2007 , a team - record eight - year streak .
Under Donovan , Florida won its first SEC Men 's Basketball Tournament in 2005 , when they beat the Kentucky Wildcats in the SEC title game .
The 2005–06 team 's 17–0 start was the best in team history , surprising many with a young , selfless squad led by four sophomores .
The team began the season unranked , but won its second consecutive SEC Tournament championship .
On April 3 , 2006 , the Gators defeated the UCLA Bruins 73–57 in the NCAA Tournament championship game to win Florida 's first men 's national basketball championship .
Within days , all five starters announced they would return for another season to try to win back - to - back championships .
At the outset of the 2006–07 season , the Gators were ranked No . 1 in both major polls for the first time .
The Gators won their second consecutive NCAA national men 's basketball championship on April 2 , 2007 , defeating the Ohio State Buckeyes 84–75 .
They became the first team since Duke in 1991–92 to win back - to - back tournaments and the first in NCAA history to do so with the same starting line - up .
Afterward , Florida 's four star juniors announced they would enter the NBA draft .
Donovan 's Gators returned to championship form in 2010–11 , winning the program 's fifth regular season SEC championship and fighting their way to the NCAA regional semifinals ( the " Elite Eight " ) before losing 74–71 to the Butler Bulldogs in overtime .
In 2011–12 , the Gators received a No . 7 seed in the NCAA tournament , exceeded expectations , and advanced to the Elite Eight , headlined by the play of star freshman Bradley Beal and point guard Erving Walker , before falling to Louisville .
During the 2013–14 season , the Gators were ranked No . 1 in the nation , won the SEC championship with 36 straight wins during the regular season and tournament games , went on a school - record 30 game winning streak , and advanced to the NCAA Final Four , headlined by the play of four senior veterans : Patric Young , Scottie Wilbekin , Will Yeguete and Casey Prather .
The Gators men 's basketball team is currently led by coach Michael White , and plays its home games in the O'Connell Center .
White 's Gators returned to the NCAA Tournament in 2016–17 after a two - year absence despite finishing second in the SEC during the regular season and suffering an early exit from the SEC Tournament .
The Gators , as a # 4 seed , ultimately reached the Elite Eight before falling short against fellow conference partner South Carolina .
WOMEN 'S BASKETBALL Section::::Women 's basketball .
Women 's basketball was approved as a new women 's varsity sport by Florida in March 1972 , but began play in 1973 as a club team .

ATHLETIC PROGRAM CULTURE AND TRADITIONS
COLORS AND MASCOT Section::::Athletic program culture and traditions .
Section::::Colors and mascot .
The University of Florida began its sports program soon after it was established in Gainesville in 1906 , and its teams adopted orange and blue as their official colors soon thereafter .
These colors are a probably a combination of the colors of the two primary institutions that merged to form the university , as the East Florida Seminary used orange and black and the Florida Agricultural College used blue and white .
As with the school colors , the exact origin of the alligator ( almost always shortened to " gator " ) as the school mascot is not well documented .
It likely originated in 1908 , when Gainesville merchant Phillip Miller chose the animal to adorn pennants he designed for sale to students .
The school did not yet have a mascot , and Miller chose the alligator because it is native to Florida and was not claimed by any other school .
The football team subsequently adopted the " Gators " nickname in 1911 .
There are two theories as how the name become synonymous with the university 's athletic programs .
One theory is that the 1911 football squad began calling themselves the Gators in honor of team captain Neal " Bo Gator " Storter .
Storter himself refuted this explanation , saying that it originated when a sportswriter in South Carolina described Florida 's 1911 road upset of Clemson as an " invasion of alligators from Florida " and the players adopted the name .
Whatever its origins , the nickname " Gators " ( and for a time , " Lady Gators " for women 's sports ) has been used by the University of Florida 's athletic program for over a century .
ALBERT AND ALBERTA Section::::Albert and Alberta .
Albert and Alberta are the official costumed mascots of the Florida Gators .
Many variations of Albert have been present at sporting events over the decades , and a live alligator was used for many years .
The current version of Albert was introduced in the early 1980s , and Alberta joined him in 1984 .
They are unique among the SEC 's mascots as the only male - and - female pair , and are featured together in a life - sized statue outside of UF 's Alumni Affairs Building .
OTHER FLORIDA TRADITIONS
Section::::Other Florida traditions .
The " Gator Chomp " is a gesture made by Florida Gators fans and players to show their support of the Florida Gators sports teams .
The chomp originated in 1981 .
The chomp is performed by fully extending one 's arms , one over the other , in front of the body with the palms facing each other , and then moved apart and together to symbolize an alligator 's mouth .
When performed by fans at home football or basketball games , the chomp is often accompanied by Florida 's marching band or pep band playing the two - note shark motif from the film Jaws .
" Orange and blue " is a fan cheer that is popular at home sports events , with alternate stadium sections yelling " Orange ! " , and answering back with their loudest " Blue !
" This can go back and forth for several minutes , with both sections competing to be the louder .
The football team had a long - time tradition of having George Edmondson Jr. — better known as " Mr. Two Bits " — wandering through the stands with a sign and a whistle to pump up the crowd to the " Two Bits " cheer .
Edmondson officially retired in 2008 , and was made an honorary alumnus in 2005 .
His final appearance as Mr. Two Bits was at the last home game of the 2008 season against The Citadel .
The University of Florida 's marching band is known as " The Pride of the Sunshine " , and plays at every home football game , and also performs at various events such as Gator Growl and parades .
The Gatorettes are the baton - twirlers , or majorettes , for the marching band .
The Pride of the Sunshine plays the University of Florida Alma Mater at Florida Field before the start of every home football game .
Following every home game , the entire football team gathers on Florida Field and joins fans in singing the Alma Mater while the band plays .
Florida alumnus and former head football coach Steve Spurrier re - introduced this tradition to Florida Gators football games in 1990 .
Another football fan tradition , at home and on the road , is the Gator fans ' linking arms , swaying , and singing "
We Are the Boys from Old Florida " at the end of every third quarter .
The University of Florida 's fight song , " The Orange and Blue " , is played frequently at all Florida Gators athletic events .
