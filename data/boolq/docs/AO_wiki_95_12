CONTROVERSIES AND CRITICISMS Section::::Controversies and criticisms .
The Tata Group has also attracted some controversy during its more than 150 years in operation , notably : MUNNAR , KERALA Section::::Munnar , Kerala .
The Kerala Government filed an affidavit in the high court alleging that Tata Tea had " grabbed " forest land of at Munnar .
The Tatas provided that they possessed of land , which they are allowed to retain under the Kannan Devan Hill ( Resumption of Lands ) Act , 1971 , and there was a shortage of 278.23 hectares in that .
The Chief Minister of Kerala V.S. Achuthanandan , who vowed to evict all on government land in Munnar , formed a special squad for the Munnar land takeover mission and started acquiring back properties .
However , the mission was aborted due to both influential land - holders and opposition from Achuthanandan 's own party .
KALINGANAGAR , ODISHA Section::::Kalinganagar , Odisha .
On 2 January 2006 , Kalinganagar , Odisha villagers protested the construction of a compound wall on land historically owned by them , for a Tata steel plant .
Police opened fire at a crowd after a policeman was gruesomely killed by the mob .
SUPPLIES TO BURMA 'S MILITARY REGIME Section::::Supplies to Burma 's military regime .
In December 2006 , Myanmar 's chief of general staff , General Thura Shwe Mann , visited the Tata Motors plant in Pune .
In 2009 , TATA Motors announced that it would manufacture trucks in Myanmar .
Tata Motors reported that these contracts to supply hardware and automobiles to Burma 's military were subsequently criticism by human rights activists .
SINGUR
LAND ACQUISITION Section::::Singur land acquisition .
The Singur controversy in West Bengal was a series of protests by locals and political parties over the forced acquisition , eviction , and inadequate compensation to those farmers displaced for the Tata Nano plant , during which Mamata Banerjee 's party was widely criticised as acting for political gain .
Despite the support of the Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) state government , Tata eventually pulled the project out of West Bengal , citing safety concerns .
Narendra Modi , then Chief Minister of Gujarat , made land available for the Nano project .
On Aug 31 , 2016 , in a historic judgement , the Honorable Supreme Court of India set aside the land acquisition by the West Bengal Government in 2006 that had facilitated Tata Motors ' Nano plant , stating that the West Bengal government had not taken possession of the land legally , and were now required to repossess and return it to local farmers within 12 weeks without compensation .
DHAMRA PORT , ODISHA Section::::Dhamra Port , Odisha .
The Port of Dhamara has received significant coverage , sparking controversy in India , and in Tata 's emerging global markets .
The Dhamra port , an equal joint venture between Tata Steel and Larsen & Toubro , has been criticised for its proximity to the Gahirmatha Sanctuary and Bhitarkanika National Park by Indian and international organisations , including Greenpeace ; Gahirmatha Beach is one of the world 's largest mass nesting sites for the Olive Ridley Turtle , and India 's second largest mangrove forest , Bhitarkanika , is a designated Ramsar site , and critics claimed that the port could disrupt mass nesting at Gahirmtha beaches as well as the ecology of the Bitharkanika mangrove forest .
TATA Steel employed mitigation measures set by the project 's official advisor , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) , and the company pledging to " adopt all its recommendations without exception " when conservation organisations asserted that a thorough environmental impact analysis had not been done for the project , which had undergone changes in size and specifications since it was first proposed .
PROPOSED SODA EXTRACTION PLANT IN TANZANIA
Section::::Proposed soda extraction plant in Tanzania .
In 2007 , Tata Group joined forces with a Tanzanian company to build a soda ash extraction plant in Tanzania .
Environmental activists oppose the plant because it would be near Lake Natron , and it has a very high chance of affecting the lake 's ecosystem and its neighbouring dwellers , jeopardising endangered Lesser Flamingo birds .
Lake Natron is where two - thirds of Lesser Flamingos reproduce .
Producing soda ash involves drawing out salt water from the lake , and then disposing the water back to the lake .
This process could interrupt the chemical makeup of the lake .
22 African nations signed a petition to stop its construction .
EPIC SYSTEMS
TRADE - SECRET CASE JUDGEMENT Section::::Epic Systems trade - secret case judgement .
In April 2016 , a U.S. Federal Grand Jury awarded Epic Systems a $ 940 million judgement against Tata Consultancy Services and Tata America International Corp.

" In 2017 , U.S. District Court Judge William Conley reduced the Award to $ 420 million ; the company states that the judgement is also being appealed , as " not supported by evidence presented during the trial and a strong appeal can be made to superior court to fully set aside the jury verdict . "
2018 NCLT VERDICT Section::::2018 NCLT verdict .
In July 2018 , the National Company Law Tribunal ( NCLT ) , which " adjudicates issues relating to Indian companies , " issued a verdict in the company 's favor on charges of mismanagement leveled in 2016 by ousted chairman , Cyrus Mistry . 2016
