BACHELOR OF ARCHITECTURE
The Bachelor of Architecture ( B.Arch . ) is a bachelor 's degree designed to satisfy the academic requirement of practicing architecture .
AUSTRALIA Section::::Australia .
Architectural education in Australia varies depending on the university offering the course .
All Australian architecture schools and programs have recently moved to some variation on the 3 + 2 Bologna model , with a three - year undergraduate degree , followed by a two - year course - work based Master of Architecture professional degree .
Some universities also require 6â€“12 months of practice work experience between the two degrees .
Registration as an architect is via state - based boards and requires a minimum of two years practice experience under the supervision of a registered architect .
In addition there are double degrees offered by many universities , such as those combining architecture with construction or landscape architecture .
Some universities also offer masters programs in architecture via coursework or research .
Many architecture faculties offer related programs in landscape architecture , urban planning , urban design , property and construction .
Entry to Australian architecture programs is highly competitive and the proportion of students at some architecture schools from outside Australia is very high , up to 40 % .

In France , architectural education is offered in various independent schools of architecture , both private and public .
The first step of architectural education is the Diploma of Studies in Architecture , a three - year degree equivalent to a Bachelor of Architecture .
This degree does not allow registration as an architect , awardees must pursue a Master of Architecture in order to obtain vocational qualification .
INDIA Section::::India .
In India , Bachelor of Architecture lasts for five years .
Specialised institutes founded by the government of India , for excellence in the field of architecture and planning are SPAs ( Schools of Planning and Architecture ) .
They are Institutes of National Importance through an act in the Parliament , on the lines of IITs , NITs and IIMs .
Currently there are three such SPAs , with the MHRD ( Ministry of Human Resource Development ) mulling over setting up more such institutes .
* School of Planning and Architecture , Delhi * School of Planning and Architecture , Bhopal * School of Planning and Architecture , Vijayawada Some other institutes offering courses in architecture include the following : * East West School of Architecture , Bangalore * School of Planning and Architecture , Centre for Design Excellence , Jaipur * State University of Performing And Visual Arts , Rohtak * National Institute of Technology Hamirpur , Himachal Pradesh

Architectural education is offered in various universities as a four - year program .
The language of the program depends on the university .
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
Section::::United Arab Emirates .
The American University of Sharjah is the first university outside of North America to offer a B.Arch .
that is officially accredited by the US - based National Architectural Accrediting Board ( NAAB ) .
Other universities where UAE students Enroll are : * School of Planning and Architecture , Centre for Design Excellence ] UNITED KINGDOM Section::::United Kingdom .
Architectural education differs slightly in the United Kingdom .
A five - year course used to exist in a similar fashion to the United States , but the 1960s saw the introduction of the sandwich course and a split of the B.Arch .
into a 3-year BA ( Hons . ) degree ( or in some cases BSc ) followed by a year working in practice , after which a 2-year MA , PG - DipArch , M.Arch .
or B.Arch .
is completed .
A further year of work completes the student 's education upon the passing of Part III final examinations ( See below ) .
Registration as an architect is then permissible by the Architects Registration Board .
Many UK universities offer postgraduate programs by coursework and research in architecture and related fields such as landscape architecture , planning , and urban design .
THE RIBA THREE - PART EXAMINATIONS Section::::The
RIBA three - part examinations .
In effect , for most students to become an architect in the United Kingdom they must pass or be exempted from parts I , II and III of the RIBA 's examinations .
Completion of the three - year BA or BSc gives an exemption from Part I. Completion of the two - year DipArch , M.Arch .
or B.Arch .
gives exemption from Part II and the final two years of supervised practical training , with supplemental examinations and assignments , makes up the requirements for Part III .
An alternative route to qualification exists by sitting the exams directly - currently this administered by Oxford Brookes University on behalf of the RIBA .

I and part II level .
For students who want to study outside of the UK , the RIBA recognized courses offer the advantage of internationally recognized degrees , and other benefits , such as the possibility of RIBA membership .
UNITED STATES Section::::United States .
The Bachelor of Architecture is accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board ( NAAB ) as a professional degree , allowing the recipient to qualify for the Architect Registration Examination ( ARE ) .
NAAB - accredited B.Arch .
programs must include at least 150 semester credit hours , or the quarter - hour equivalent , of which at least 45 semester hours , or the quarter - hour equivalent are in general studies .
There are also universities that offer a four - year degree such as a Bachelor of Science in Architectural Studies or a Bachelor of Science in Architecture ( B.S.Arch ) or a Bachelor of Arts in Architectural Studies ( B.A.Arch ) .
These are non - accredited , pre - professional degrees , and so these students must enroll in a Master of Architecture ( M.Arch ) program to be professionally licensed .
However , enrolling in a pre - professional program often gets a student into a shorter M.Arch program .
Any architecturally - related curriculum may eventually make licensure possible , depending upon the laws or regulations of the jurisdiction in which you wish to be licensed .
The course of study of the Bachelor of Architecture includes studio courses on design and aesthetic theory , as well as practical courses on structures , building mechanical systems , electrical systems , plumbing and construction .
Student work is often in the form of drawings and renderings , either through computer - aided design or drafting by hand .
Students also build physical models and create presentation boards for drawings and graphics .
In nearly all architecture schools in the United States , student life and work revolves around a studio class .
Other classes in the architecture curriculum are designed to support the concepts emphasized in studio .
One particularly rigorous aspect of studio classes is the " critique " or " review .
" Students " pin - up " their models and presentation drawings for instructors ( and students ) who offer constructive criticism .
