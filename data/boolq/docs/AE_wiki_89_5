HISTORY 1937
TO 1945 Section::::History .
Section::::1937 to 1945 .
Volkswagen ( " People 's car " in German ) was founded on 28 May 1937 in Berlin as the Gesellschaft zur Vorbereitung des Deutschen Volkswagens mbH ( " Limited Liability Company for the preparation of the German People 's Car " , abbreviated to Gezuvor ) by the National Socialist Deutsche Arbeitsfront ( German Labour Front ) .
The purpose of the company was to manufacture the Volkswagen car , originally referred to as the Porsche Type 60 , then the Volkswagen Type 1 , and commonly called the Volkswagen Beetle .
This vehicle was designed by Ferdinand Porsche 's consulting firm , and the company was backed by the support of Adolf Hitler .
On 16 September 1938 , Gezuvor was renamed Volkswagenwerk GmbH ( " Volkswagen Factory limited liability company " ) .
Shortly after the factory near Fallersleben was completed , World War II started and the plant primarily manufactured the military Kübelwagen ( Porsche Type 82 ) and the related amphibious Schwimmwagen ( Type 166 ) , both of which were derived from the Volkswagen .
Only a small number of Type 60 Volkswagens were made during this time .
The Fallersleben plant also manufactured the V-1 flying bomb , making the plant a major bombing target for the Allied forces .
1945 TO 1970 Section::::1945 to 1970 .
After the war in Europe , in June 1945 , Major Ivan Hirst of the British Army Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers ( REME ) took control of the bomb - shattered factory , and restarted production , pending the expected disposal of the plant as war reparations .
However , no British car manufacturer was interested ; " the vehicle does not meet the fundamental technical requirement of a motor - car ...
it is quite unattractive to the average buyer ...
To build the car commercially would be a completely uneconomic enterprise " .
In 1948 , the Ford Motor Company of USA was offered Volkswagen , but Ernest Breech , a Ford executive vice president said he did n't think either the plant or the car was " worth a damn .
" Breech later said that he would have considered merging Ford of Germany and Volkswagen , but after the war , ownership of the company was in such dispute that nobody could possibly hope to be able to take it over .
As part of the Industrial plans for Germany , large parts of German industry , including Volkswagen , were to be dismantled .
Total German car production was set at a maximum of 10 % of the 1936 car production numbers .
The company survived by producing cars for the British Army , and in 1948 the British Government handed the company back over to the German state , and it was managed by former Opel chief Heinrich Nordhoff .
Production of the Type 60 Volkswagen ( re - designated Type 1 ) started slowly after the war due to the need to rebuild the plant and because of the lack of raw materials , but production grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s .
The company began introducing new models based on the Type 1 , all with the same basic air - cooled , rear - engine , rear - drive platform .
These included the Volkswagen Type 2 in 1950 , the Volkswagen Karmann Ghia in 1955 , the Volkswagen Type 3 in 1961 , the Volkswagen Type 4 in 1968 , and the Volkswagen Type 181 in 1969 .
In 1960 , upon the flotation of part of the German federal government 's stake in the company on the German stock market , its name became Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft ( usually abbreviated to Volkswagenwerk AG ) .
On 1 January 1965 , Volkswagenwerk acquired Auto Union GmbH from its parent company Daimler - Benz .
The new subsidiary went on to produce the first post - war Audi models , the Audi F103 series , shortly afterwards .
Another German manufacturer , NSU Motorenwerke AG , was merged into Auto Union on 26 August 1969 , creating a new company , Audi NSU Auto Union AG ( later renamed AUDI AG in 1985 ) .
1970 TO 2000 Section::::1970 to 2000 .
From the late 1970s to 1992 , the acronym V.A.G was used by Volkswagen AG as a brand for group - wide activities , such as distribution and leasing .
Contrary to popular belief , " V.A.G " had no official meaning , and was never the name of the Volkswagen Group .
On 30 September 1982 , Volkswagenwerk made its first step expanding outside Germany by signing a co - operation agreement with the Spanish car manufacturer SEAT , S.A.
In order to reflect the company 's increasing global diversification from its headquarters and main plant ( the Volkswagenwerk in Wolfsburg ) , on 4 July 1985 , the company name was changed again – to Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft ( Volkswagen AG ) .
On 18 June 1986 , Volkswagen AG acquired a 51 % controlling stake in SEAT , making it the first non - German subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group .
On 23 December the same year , it became the Spanish company 's major shareholder by increasing its share up to 75 % .
In 1990 – after purchasing its entire equity – Volkswagen AG took over the full ownership of SEAT , making the company a wholly owned subsidiary , and on 28 March 1991 another step to the expansion of the group 's activities was made through the signing of a joint venture partnership agreement with Škoda automobilová a.s . of Czechoslovakia , accompanied with the acquisition of a 30 % stake in the Czech car manufacturer , raised later on 19 December 1994 to 60.3 % and the year after , on 11 December 1995 , to 70 % of its shares .
Three prestige automotive marques were added to the Volkswagen portfolio in 1998 :
Bentley , Lamborghini and Bugatti .

Volkswagen Group revealed on 24 October 2009 that it had made an offer to acquire long - time partner and German niche automotive manufacturer Wilhelm Karmann GmbH out of bankruptcy protection .
