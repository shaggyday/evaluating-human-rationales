PARCHMENT PAPER Parchment paper and bakery release paper are cellulose - based papers that are used in baking as a disposable non - stick surface .
Both are also called bakery paper or baking paper .
They should not be confused with waxed paper , also known as wax paper or rarely as butter paper .
PARCHMENT PAPER Section::::Parchment paper .
Modern parchment paper is made by running sheets of paper pulp through a bath of sulfuric acid ( a method similar to how tracing paper is made ) or sometimes zinc chloride .
This process partially dissolves or gelatinizes the paper .
This treatment forms a sulfurized cross - linked material with high density , stability , and heat resistance , and low surface energy — thereby imparting good non - stick or release properties .
The treated paper has an appearance similar to that of traditional parchment , and because of its stability is sometimes used for legal purposes where traditional parchment was used .
BAKERY RELEASE
PAPER Section::::Bakery release paper .
The stickless properties can be also achieved by employing a coated paper , for which a suitable release agent — a coating with a low surface energy and capability to withstand the temperatures involved in the baking or roasting process — is deposited onto the paper 's surface ; silicone ( cured with a suitable catalyst ) is frequently used .
APPLICATIONS
Section::::Applications .
A common use is to eliminate the need to grease sheet pans and the like , allowing very rapid turn - around of batches of baked goods .
Parchment paper is also used to cook en papillote , a technique where food is steamed or cooked within closed pouches made from parchment paper .
Bakery paper can be used in most applications that call for wax paper as a non - stick surface .
The reverse is not true , as using wax paper will cause smoke in the oven and affect taste .
