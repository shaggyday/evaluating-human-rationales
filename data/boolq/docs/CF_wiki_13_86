ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
Section::::Organizational structure .
Beginning in 2011 and continuing into 2012 , UnitedHealth Group implemented an enterprise reorganization .
This coincided with retiring brands adopted following the various acquisitions of previous years and adopting the unified brand UnitedHealthcare .
The firm decided to refocus its UK business solely on commissioning support under the name of Optum , and exploit the opportunities presented by the United Kingdom Government 's NHS reforms in 2011 .
Towards this end , it sold its six primary care clinics .

UnitedHealthcare Select is exclusive provider organization ( EPO ) with no coverage for out - of - network providers while UnitedHealthcare Select
Plus is a preferred provider organization ( PPO ) .
UnitedHealthcare Choice functions as a HMO plan with access to specialists , whereas UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus is an HMO which allows for out - of - network coverage .
UnitedHealthcare Navigate , Charter , and Compass require a primary care physician referral to see a specialist meaning that they are more restrictive managed care plans .
PROVIDER NETWORKS Section::::Provider networks .
UnitedHealthcare negotiates with providers in periodic contract negotiations ; contracts may be discontinued from time to time .
High - profile contract disputes can span provider networks across the nation , as in the case of a 2018 dispute with a major emergency room doctor group Envision Healthcare .
Maintaining up - to - date provider directories is necessary as CMS can fine insurers with outdated directories .
As a condition of participation , UnitedHealthcare requires that providers notify them of changes , but also has a Professional Verification Outreach program to proactively request information from providers .
However , providers are burdened by having to maintain their information with multiple networks ( e.g. , competitors to UnitedHealthcare ) .
The total cost of maintaining these directories is estimated at $ 2.1b annually , and a blockchain initiative began in 2018 to share the directory .

The investigations came to light after a series of probing stories in the Wall Street Journal in May 2006 , discussing apparent backdating of hundreds of millions of dollars ' worth of stock options by UHC management .

OPTUMINSIGHT
EARLIER KNOWN
AS INGENIX Section::::OptumInsight earlier known as Ingenix .
In February 2008 , New York State Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo announced an industry - wide investigation into a scheme by health insurers to defraud consumers by manipulating reasonable and customary rates .
The announcement included a statement that Cuomo intended " to file suit against Ingenix , Inc. , its parent UnitedHealth Group , and three additional subsidiaries . "
Cuomo asserted that his investigation found that rates found in a database of health care charges maintained by Ingenix were lower than what he determined was the actual cost of certain medical expenses .
Cuomo said this inappropriately allowed health insurance companies to deny a portion of provider claims , thereby pushing costs down to members .
On January 13 , 2009 , Ingenix announced an agreement with the New York State attorney settling the probe into the independence of the health pricing database .
Under the settlement , UnitedHealth Group and Ingenix would pay $ 50 million to finance a new , non - profit entity that would develop a new health care pricing database .
Ingenix would discontinue its medical pricing databases when the new entity makes its product available .
The company acknowledged the appearance of a conflict of interest , but admitted no wrongdoing .
On January 15 , 2009 , UnitedHealth Group announced a $ 350 million settlement of three class action lawsuits filed in Federal court by the American Medical Association , UnitedHealth Group members , healthcare providers , and state medical societies for not paying out - of - network benefits .
This settlement came two days after a similar settlement with Cuomo .
On October 27 , 2009 , Cuomo announced the creation of FAIR Health , the independent , non - profit organization that will develop a nationwide database for consumer reimbursement , as well as a website where consumers will be able to compare prices before they choose doctors .
To fund FAIR Health , the Attorney General 's office secured nearly $ 100 million from insurers such as Aetna , UnitedHealth Group , and Anthem .
OPTIONS BACKDATING INVESTIGATIONS AND LAWSUITS Section::::Options backdating investigations and lawsuits .
In 2006 , the SEC began investigating the conduct of UnitedHealth Group 's management and directors , including Dr. McGuire , as did the Internal Revenue Service and prosecutors in the U.S. attorney 's office for the Southern District of New York , who have subpoenaed documents from the company .
The investigations came to light after a series of probing stories in the Wall Street Journal in March 2006 , discussing the apparent backdating of hundreds of millions of dollars ' worth of stock options — in a process called options backdating — by UnitedHealth Group management .
The backdating apparently occurred with the knowledge and approval of the directors , according to the Journal .
Major shareholders have filed lawsuits accusing former New Jersey governor Thomas Kean and UnitedHealth Group 's other directors of failing in their fiduciary duty .
RESIGNATION OF MCGUIRE Section::::Resignation of McGuire .
On October 15 , 2006 , it was announced that Dr. McGuire would step down immediately as chairman and director of UnitedHealth Group , and step down as CEO on December 1 , 2006 , due to his involvement in the employee stock options scandal .
Simultaneously , it was announced that he would be replaced as CEO by Stephen Hemsley , who has served as President and COO and is a member of the board of directors .
McGuire 's exit compensation from UnitedHealth , expected to be around $ 1.1 billion , would be the largest golden parachute in the history of corporate America .
McGuire 's compensation became controversial again on May 21 , 2009 , when Elizabeth Edwards , speaking on The Daily Show , used it to support her argument for a public alternative to commercial insurance .
Edwards stressed the importance of restoring competition in health insurance markets noting that at one point , " the President of UnitedHealth made so much money , that one of every $ 700 that was spent in this country on health care went to pay him . "
Since estimates of McGuire 's 2005 compensation range from $ 59,625,444 to $ 124.8 million , and the revenue of UnitedHealth Group was then $ 71 billion , it is therefore possible that Mrs. Edwards may have meant that one of every $ 700 that was spent on UnitedHealth Group premiums went to pay McGuire .
MCGUIRE 'S SETTLEMENT WITH SEC Section::::McGuire 's settlement with SEC .
On December 6 , 2007 , the SEC announced a settlement under which McGuire was to repay $ 468 million , including a $ 7 million civil penalty , as a partial settlement of the backdating prosecution .
He was also barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for ten years .
This was the first time in which the little - used " clawback " provision under the Sarbanes - Oxley Act was used against an individual by the SEC .
The SEC continued its investigations even after it in 2008 settled legal actions against both UnitedHealth Group itself and its former general counsel .
MEDICARE OVERBILLING LAWSUIT Section::::Medicare overbilling lawsuit .
A whistleblower lawsuit , filed in 2011 , charges UnitedHealth Group 's data analytics division with assisting in defrauding Medicare by boosting risk adjustment scores from Medicare Advantage companies .
The suit alleges that UnitedHealth Group subsidiary Ingenix ( now OptumInsight ) " defrauded the United States of hundreds of millions — and likely billions — of dollars . "
Former UnitedHealth executive Benjamin Poehling brought the suit under the False Claims Act .
The government said it would proceed on claims against two health care companies , UnitedHealth and its Texas subsidiary WellMed Medical Management .
In February 2017 , a federal judge unsealed the suit after the Department of Justice announced it would join the case .
POLICY RESEARCH ORG .
OWNERSHIP Section::::Policy Research Org .
ownership .
The Lewin Group is a policy research and consulting firm that provides economic analysis of health care and human services issues and policies .
The organization has existed for about 40 years and has maintained a nonpartisan reputation through its many ownership changes that have occurred over that time .
The Lewin Group was purchased in 2007 by Ingenix , a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group , but alleges editorial and analytical " independence " from UnitedHealth Group , its parent company .
The Lewin Group discloses its ownership in its reports and on its web site .
While the Lewin Group does not advocate for or against any legislation , both Democratic and Republican politicians frequently cite the firm 's studies to argue for and against various U.S. healthcare reform proposals .
For example , Democratic Senator Ron Wyden uses Lewin Group estimates to cite the feasibility of his Healthy Americans Act .
Former U.S. Representative Eric Cantor , the former House Republican Whip , has referred to the organization as " the nonpartisan Lewin Group " in arguing against government - funded health insurance proposals .
Recently , several Lewin studies have been used to argue both for and against the inclusion of a public option in national health reform .
Lewin clients who often cite its findings include The Commonwealth Fund which recently held up a Lewin study it commissioned to advocate for a public plan .
The report showed that legislative proposals would achieve nearly universal coverage and " estimated that a public plan could offer small businesses insurance that is at least 9 percent cheaper than current small - business policies . "
However , The Lewin Group has acknowledged that clients sometimes choose not to publicize the results of studies they have commissioned .
Indeed , Lewin Group Vice President John Sheils told the Washington Post " sometimes studies come out that do n't show exactly what the client wants to see .
And in those instances , they have [ the ] option to bury the study . " FOUNDATIONS Section::::Foundations .
UnitedHealth Group has two foundations , the United Health Foundation and UnitedHealthcare Children 's Foundation which were formed in 1999 .
Since established by UnitedHealth Group in 1999 as a not for profit private foundation , the United Health Foundation has committed more than $ 170 million to improve health and health care .
