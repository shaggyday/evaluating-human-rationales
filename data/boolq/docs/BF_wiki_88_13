HISTORY Section::::History .
The building was completed in 1885 in Chicago , Illinois , and was the first tall building to use structural steel in its frame , but the majority of its structure was composed of cast and wrought iron .
While the Ditherington Flax Mill was an earlier fireproof - metal - framed building and is sometimes considered to be the first skyscraper , it was only five stories tall .
Because of the building 's unique architecture and weight - bearing frame , it is considered the one of the world 's first skyscrapers .
It had 10 stories and rose to a height of In 1891 , two floors were added .
The architect was William Le Baron Jenney .
The building weighed only one - third as much as a masonry building would have ; city officials were so concerned , they halted construction while they investigated its safety .
The Home Insurance Building is an example of the Chicago School of Architecture .
The building set precedents in skyscraper construction .
Minneapolis architect Leroy Buffington patented the concept of the skeletal - frame tall building in 1888 and proposed " a 28-story ' stratosphere - scraper'â€”a notion mocked by the architectural press of the time as impractical and ludicrous . "
His proposal nonetheless attracted the attention of the national architectural and building communities to the possibilities of iron skeletal framing , " which in primitive form had been around for decades . "
