FINAL DESTINATION Final Destination is an American horror franchise composed of five films , comic books and novels .
It is based on an unproduced spec script by Jeffrey Reddick , originally written for The X - Files television series , and was distributed by New Line Cinema .
All five films center around a small group of people who escape impending death when one individual ( the protagonist of each film ) has a sudden premonition and warns them that they will all die in a terrible mass - casualty accident .
After avoiding their foretold deaths , the survivors are killed one by one in bizarre accidents caused by an unseen force creating complicated chains of cause and effect , resembling Rube Goldberg machines in their complexity .
The series is noteworthy among other films in the horror genre in that the antagonist is not a stereotypical slasher or other physical being , but Death personified , subtly manipulating circumstances in the environment with a design on claiming anyone who escapes their fated demise .
In addition to the films , a novel series , which includes the novelizations of the first three films , was published throughout 2005 and 2006 by Black Flame .
A one - shot comic book titled Final Destination : Sacrifice was released alongside select DVDs of Final Destination 3 in 2006 , and a comic series titled Final Destination : Spring Break was published by Zenescope Entertainment in 2007 .

DEVELOPMENT Section::::Development .
Final Destination was written by Jeffrey Reddick after having " read a story about a woman who was on vacation and her mom called her and said , ' Do n't take the flight tomorrow , I have a really bad feeling about it . ' " .
The woman switched flights and the plane she was originally supposed to take crashed .
Originally having written the script as an episode of The X Files , Reddick decided to turn the script into a feature - length film at the behest of one of his New Line Cinema colleagues .
After reading his spec script , New Line Cinema hired Reddick to write the screenplay ; James Wong and Glen Morgan were later brought on board to help with the script , making alterations to comply with their standards .
