As of late 2005 , much of the new residential development in Hamilton has been geared to accommodating the aging baby boomer generation .
New retirement communities and assisted - living facilities outpace that of new traditional residential communities .
Such construction has been spurred by several factors .
The first being that the public is skeptical of growing school budgets due to its already large size .
Hamilton voters have often rejected increases in school budgets in their yearly elections to keep already high taxes from growing higher .
As a result , the planning board has been reluctant to authorize construction of housing that will increase the student population .
Another reason is a series of improvements to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital .
The hospital is now a highly respected source of care in the state .
It is situated next to where most of the under - developed land in the township used to be , land that is now home to the active older - adult communities .
As of October 2016 , significant construction has been done to further build up the Hamilton Township area .
Multiple new retirement communities have been constructed , as well as multiple new restaurants , banks , gas stations and convenience stores along Route 33 .
