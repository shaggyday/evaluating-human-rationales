2014 FIFA WORLD CUP FINAL
The 2014 FIFA World Cup Final was a football match that took place on 13 July 2014 at the Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil to determine the 2014 FIFA World Cup champion .
Germany defeated Argentina 1–0 in extra time , with the only goal being scored by Mario Götze , who collected André Schürrle 's cross from the left on his chest before volleying a high left - footed shot into the net .
The match was the third final between the two countries , a World Cup record , after their 1986 and 1990 matches , and billed as the world 's best player ( Lionel Messi ) versus the world 's best team ( Germany ) .
Before the match , Germany had reached the World Cup final seven times ( six times as West Germany from 1954 to 1990 ) , winning three ( 1954 , 1974 , 1990 ) and being runners - up four times ( 1966 , 1982 , 1986 , 2002 ) ; Argentina had reached four finals , winning twice ( 1978 , 1986 ) and placing second twice ( 1930 , 1990 ) .
The result marked Germany 's fourth World Cup title and their first World championship as a unified nation .
The victory meant that three consecutive World Cups have been won by teams from the same continent , following Italy and Spain in 2006 and 2010 respectively , the first time this has happened in World Cup history .
It was also the first time that three consecutive World Cup finals were still tied after 90 minutes .
The final marked the first time a World Cup hosted in the Americas was not won by a team from the continent .
In the winning German team , Miroslav Klose , who had become the top scorer in World Cup history in the semi - final victory over Brazil , became one of the very few players ever to have won gold , silver and bronze medals in the World Cup ( bronze in 2006 and 2010 , silver in 2002 and gold in 2014 ) , joining a club with earlier German players like Franz Beckenbauer , Sepp Maier and Wolfgang Overath ( 1966–1974 ) , as well as Italian Franco Baresi ( 1982–1994 ) .
According to FIFA , 1.013 billion individuals globally watched the final match of this tournament .

MATCH SUMMARY Section::::Match .
Section::::Summary .
Both teams named unchanged starting line - ups from their semi - finals , but German midfielder Sami Khedira withdrew during the warm - up with a calf injury .
He was replaced by Christoph Kramer , who had made two brief substitute appearances during the tournament .
Kramer himself suffered a head injury after a collision with Ezequiel Garay inside the penalty area , but was initially cleared to continue playing .
Fourteen minutes later in the 31st minute however , he collapsed to the ground , apparently suffering from concussion and was replaced by André Schürrle .
Argentina 's Gonzalo Higuaín missed a good opportunity in the first half , dragging his shot wide after being put through on goal by a misjudged header from Toni Kroos .
He had a goal disallowed later in the first half , when he was ruled offside after tapping in a cross by Ezequiel Lavezzi from the right wing .
Germany responded when Thomas Müller raced into the penalty area and cut the ball back for Schürrle , who saw his first - time effort saved by a diving Argentine goalkeeper Sergio Romero .
As the half ended Germany had a brief flurry of chances , the closest coming when Benedikt Höwedes ' header hit the post from a corner during injury time .
In the second half Lionel Messi missed an early opportunity when he fired wide of the German goal from inside the penalty area after receiving a through pass , but the remainder of the half saw fewer chances with the closest coming from a Toni Kroos shot that went wide in the 81st minute .
In the 88th minute , Germany 's all - time leading scorer Miroslav Klose was substituted for Mario Götze .
This would be Klose 's final appearance for Germany .
Early in the first half of extra time André Schürrle received a pass in front of goal from Götze , but his close - range shot was stopped by Romero .
Minutes later , Rodrigo Palacio 's lob over Manuel Neuer went just wide after the forward jumped on a mistake by Mats Hummels in the German penalty area .
In the second half of extra time Mario Götze of Germany scored the winning goal in the 113th minute .
Schürrle raced past two defenders on the left before crossing into the penalty area , where Götze controlled the ball on his chest and then volleyed left - footed into the net .
He became the first substitute to score a World Cup - winning goal , as well as the youngest player to score in a World Cup Final since German Wolfgang Weber in 1966 ( same age , 22 ) .
Thomas Müller had a chance to double Germany 's lead shortly afterward when he dribbled past two defenders , but his shot across the net was too wide .
Late in extra time , Messi had an opportunity to equalise from a free kick within goal - scoring distance , but his attempt flew high over the crossbar .
In addition to Klose , Germany captain Philipp Lahm and veteran defender Per Mertesacker , a late substitute , announced that the final would also be their last match for Germany .
Combined , these three players had amassed 354 appearances for the national team between them .
