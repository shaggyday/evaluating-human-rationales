VEGETATIVE REPRODUCTION Vegetative reproduction ( also known as vegetative propagation , vegetative multiplication or vegetative cloning ) is any form of asexual reproduction occurring in plants in which a new plant grows from a fragment of the parent plant or a specialized reproductive structure .
Many plants naturally reproduce this way , but it can also be induced artificially .
Horticulturalists have developed asexual propagation techniques that use vegetative plant parts to replicate plants .
Success rates and difficulty of propagation vary greatly .
Monocotyledons typically lack a vascular cambium and therefore are harder to propagate .
BACKGROUND Section::::Background .
Plant propagation is the process of plant reproduction of a species or cultivar , and it can be sexual or asexual .
It can happen through the use of vegetative parts of the plants , such as leaves , stems , and roots to produce new plants or through growth from specialized vegetative plant parts .
While many plants reproduce by vegetative reproduction , they rarely exclusively use that method to reproduce .
Vegetative reproduction is not evolutionary advantageous ; it does not allow for genetic diversity and could lead plants to accumulate deleterious mutations .
Vegetative reproduction is favored when it allows plants to produce more offspring per unit of resource than reproduction through seed production .
In general , juvenile the plant , are easier to propagate vegetatively .
Although most plants normally reproduce sexually , many can reproduce vegetatively , or can be induced to do so via hormonal treatments .
This is because meristematic cells capable of cellular differentiation are present in many plant tissues .
Vegetative propagation is usually considered a cloning method .
However , root cuttings of thornless blackberries will revert to thorny type because the adventitious shoot develops from a cell that is genetically thorny .
Thornless blackberry is a chimera , with the epidermal layers genetically thornless but the tissue beneath it genetically thorny .
Similarly , leaf cutting propagation of certain chimeral variegated plants like the snake plant ( Sansevieria trifasciata ) , will produce mainly nonvariegated plants .
Grafting is often not a complete cloning method because seedlings are used as rootstocks .
In that case , only the top of the plant is clonal .
In some crops , particularly apples , the rootstocks are vegetatively propagated so the entire graft can be clonal if the scion and rootstock are both clones .
Apomixis ( including apospory and diplospory ) is a type of reproduction that does not involve fertilization .
In flowering plants , unfertilized seeds are produced , or plantlets that grow instead of flowers .
Hawkweed ( Hieracium ) , dandelion ( Taraxacum ) , some citrus ( Citrus ) and many grasses such as Kentucky bluegrass ( Poa pratensis ) all use this form of asexual reproduction .
Bulbils are sometimes formed instead of the flowers of garlic .
MECHANISMS Section::::Mechanisms .
Meristem tissue makes the process of asexual reproduction possible .
It is normally found in stems , leaves , and tips of stems and roots and consists of undifferentiated cells that are constantly dividing allowing for plant growth and give rise to plant tissue systems .
The meristem tissue 's ability to continuously divide allows for vegetative propagation to occur .
Another important ability that allows for vegetative propagation is the ability to develop adventitious roots which arise from other vegetative parts of the plants such as the stem or leaves .
These roots allow for the development of new plants from body parts from other plants .
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES ADVANTAGES Section::::Advantages and disadvantages .
Section::::Advantages .
There are several advantages of vegetative reproduction , mainly that the produced offspring are clones of their parent plants .
If a plant has favorable traits , it can continue to pass down its advantageous genetic information to its offspring .
It can be economically beneficial for commercial growers to clone a certain plant to ensure consistency throughout their crops .
Vegetative propagation also allows plants to avoid the costly process of producing sexual reproduction organs such as flowers and the subsequent seeds and fruits .
For example , developing an ace cultivar is extremely difficult , so , once farmers develop the desired traits in apple , they use grafting and budding to ensure the consistency of the new cultivar and its successful production on a commercial level .
However , as can be seen in many variegated plants , this does not always apply , because many plants actually are chimeras and cuttings might reflect the attributes of only one or some of the parent cell lines .
Vegetative propagation also allows plants to circumvent the immature seedling phase and reach the mature phase faster .
In nature , that increases the chances for a plant to successfully reach maturity , and , commercially , it saves farmers a lot of time and money as it allows for faster crop overturn .
Vegetative reproduction offers research advantages in several areas of biology and has practical usage when it comes to afforestation .
The most common use made of vegetative propagation by forest geneticists and tree breeders has been to move genes from selected trees to some convenient location , usually designated a gene bank , clone bank , clone - holding orchard , or seed orchard where their genes can be recombined in pedigreed offspring .
DISADVANTAGES Section::::Disadvantages .
A major disadvantage of vegetative propagation is that it prevents species genetic diversity which can lead to reductions in crop yields .
The plants are genetically identical and are all , therefore , susceptible to pathogenic plant viruses , bacteria and fungi that can wipe out entire crops .
TYPES
NATURAL MEANS Section::::Types .
Section::::Natural means .
Natural vegetative propagation is mostly a process found in herbaceous and woody perennial plants , and typically involves structural modifications of the stem , although any horizontal , underground part of a plant ( whether stem , leaf , or root ) can contribute to vegetative reproduction of a plant .
Most plant species that survive and significantly expand by vegetative reproduction would be perennial almost by definition , since specialized organs of vegetative reproduction , like seeds of annuals , serve to survive seasonally harsh conditions .
A plant that persists in a location through vegetative reproduction of individuals over a long period of time constitutes a clonal colony .
In a sense , this process is not one of reproduction but one of survival and expansion of biomass of the individual .
When an individual organism increases in size via cell multiplication and remains intact , the process is called " vegetative growth " .
However , in vegetative reproduction , the new plants that result are new individuals in almost every respect except genetic .
Of considerable interest is how this process appears to reset the aging clock .
As aforementioned , plants vegetetatively propagate both artificially and naturally .
Most common methods of natural vegetative reproduction involves the development of a new plant from specialized structures of a mature plant .
In addition to adventitious roots , roots that arise from plant structures other than the root , such as stems or leaves , modified stems , leaves and roots play an important role in plants ' ability to naturally propagate .
The most common modified stems , leaves and roots that allow for vegetative propagation are : RHIZOMES Section::::Rhizomes .
Rhizomes are stem - like structures that grow horizontally across the ground and from which new roots and shoots may arise .
They serve as protein and starch storage units serving as a nutrient source for newly developed plants .
Examples of plants that use rhizomes are ginger , lilies and irises .
RUNNERS Section::::Runners .
Also known as stolons , runners are modified stems that , unlike rhizomes , grow from existing stems just below the soil surface .
As they are propagated , the buds on the modified stems produce roots and stems .
Those buds are more separated than the ones found on the rhizome .
Examples of plants that use runners are strawberries and currants .
BULBS Section::::Bulbs .
Bulbs are inflated parts of the stem within which lie the central shoots of new plants .
They are typically underground and are surrounded by plump and layered leaves that provide nutrients to the new plant .
Examples of plants that use bulbs are shallots , lilies and tulips .
TUBERS Section::::Tubers .
Tubers develop from either the stem or the root .
Stem tubers grow from rhizomes or runners that swell from storing nutrients while root tubers propagate from roots that are modified to store nutrients and get too large and produce a new plant .
Examples of stem tubers are potatoes and yams and examples of root tubers are sweet potatoes and dahlias .
CORMS Section::::Corms .
Corms are solid enlarged underground stems that store nutrients in their fleshy and solid stem tissue and are surrounded by papery leaves .
Corms differ from bulbs in that their centers consists of solid tissue while bulbs consist of layered leaves .
Examples of plants that use corms are gladiolus and taro .
SUCKERS Section::::Suckers .
Also known as root sprouts , suckers are plant stems that arise from buds on the base of parent plants stems or on roots .
Examples of plants that use suckers are apple and banana trees .
PLANTLETS Section::::Plantlets .
Plantlets are miniature structures that arise from meristem in leaf margins that eventually develops roots and drop from the leaves they grew on .
An example of a plant that uses plantlets is the Bryophyllum daigremontianum ( syn .
Kalanchoe daigremontianum ) , which is also known as mother of thousands for its many plantlets .
KEIKIS Section::::Keikis .
Keikis are additional offshoots which develop on vegetative stems or flower stalks of several orchids genera .
Examples of plants that use keikis are the Phalaenopsis , Epidendrum , and Dendrobium genera of orchids .
APOMIXIS Section::::Apomixis .
Apomixis is the process of asexual reproduction through seed , in the absence of meiosis and fertilization , generating clonal progeny of maternal origin .
ARTIFICIAL MEANS Section::::Artificial means .
Vegetative propagation of particular cultivars that have desirable characteristics is very common practice .
It is used by farmers and horticulturalists to produce better crops with desirable qualities .
The most common methods of artificial vegetative propagation are : CUTTING Section::::Cutting .
A cutting is a part of the plant , usually a stem or a leaf , is cut off and planted .
Adventitious roots grow from cuttings and a new plant eventually develops .
Usually those cuttings are treated with hormones before being planted to induce growth .
Example :
rose;hibiscus . GRAFTING Section::::Grafting .
Grafting involves attaching a scion , or a desired cutting , to the stem of another plant that remains rooted in the ground .
Eventually both tissue systems become grafted or integrated and a plant with the characteristics of the grafted plant develops.e.g mango , gauva , etc LAYERING Section::::Layering .
Layering is a process which includes the bending of plant branches or stems so that they touch the ground and are covered with soil .
Adventitious roots develops from the underground part of the plant , which is known as the layer .
This method of vegetative reproduction also occurs naturally .
Another similar method , air layering , involved the scraping and replanting of tree branches which develop into trees .
SUCKERING
Section::::Suckering .
Suckers grow and form a dense compact mat that is attached to the parent plant .
Too many suckers can lead to smaller crop size , so excess suckers are pruned , and mature suckers are transplanted to a new area where they develop into new plants .
TISSUE CULTURE Section::::Tissue culture .
In tissue culture , plant cells are taken from various parts of the plant and are cultured and nurtured in a sterilized container .
The mass of developed tissue , known as the callus , is then cultured in a hormone - ladened medium and eventually develops into plantlets which are then planted and eventually develop into grown plants .
OFFSET Section::::Offset .
An offset is the lower part of a single culm with the rhizome axis basal to it and its roots .
Planting of these is the most conventional way of propagating bamboo .
