It is a rare achievement for an individual player to score 100 points in a single game .
What follows is an incomplete list of all of the verified occurrences of players scoring 100 points or more .
Each individual instance of the achievement may have had different circumstances surrounding it , such as game length , opponent skill level and the league in which it occurred .
Internationally , the highest single player total between national teams is 116 points , scored by the Philippines ' Lou Salvador in May 1923 against China .
It happened during the 1923 Far Eastern Games .
The highest single game total in worldwide organized basketball history , irrespective of gender , age or competition level , is 272 points , scored by a 13-year - old boy named Mats Wermelin of Sweden .
He recorded every single point in his team 's 272–0 win on February 5 , 1974 , during a regional boys ' tournament held in Stockholm .
The highest total by a female basketball player worldwide is 136 , scored by Anat Draigor of Israel .
It happened on April 5 , 2006 , in a 158–41 win .
Draigor was 46 years old playing in an Israel Division III League playoff game , which also makes her the oldest player in history to score 100 points .
Only one player , other than the United States ' Bevo Francis and Jack Taylor , has recorded multiple 100-point games in organized competition .
Croatia 's Marin Ferenčević scored 101 and 178 points in April and May 2006 , respectively , during Under-14 Croatian League matches .
In the United States , 100-point games have occurred at least once at most levels of education .
At the middle school level , 13-year - old 8th grader Bob Harrison scored all 139 of his team 's points in a 139–8 win on February 3 , 1941 .
In high school , there have been 24 verified occurrences , 19 by male players and 5 by female players .
The first recorded instance was in 1913 , when Herman Saygar of Culver High School ( Indiana ) scored 113 points against Winamac High School .
The first female to score 100 points at the high school level was Denise Long of Union - Whitten High School ( Iowa ) , who scored 111 points during a state playoff game in the spring of 1968 against Dows High School .
That season , Long 's senior year of 1967–68 , she averaged a still - standing national record 68.2 points per game .
Her single game total stood as the high school female record for 38 years until Epiphanny Prince scored 113 for Murry Bergtraum High School ( New York ) on February 2 , 2006 .
The boys ' high school record is 135 points , scored by Danny Heater on January 26 , 1960 .
Playing for Burnsville High School ( West Virginia ) against Widen High School , Heater made 53 of 70 field goals and 29 of 41 free throws .
His 135-point outburst is still the highest total for the high school level worldwide .
At the college level , there have been six 100-point games , two of which were recorded by Clarence " Bevo " Francis of Rio Grande College and two by Jack Taylor of Grinnell College .
Francis scored 116 points against Ashland College on January 9 , 1953 , but the opponent was not a four - year institution , so the total did not count as the official college record .
One year later , on February 2 , 1954 , Francis scored 113 against Hillsdale College , which was the recognized highest total in United States college basketball history for 59 years ; Grinnell 's Taylor scored 138 points on November 20 , 2012 to set the new all - time NCAA all - divisions mark .
He again recorded 100 + points on November 17 , 2013 when he scored 109 against Crossroads College .
Frank Selvy of Furman University is the only player to score 100 points at the Division I level .
Selvy recorded exactly 100 points on February 13 , 1954—less than two weeks after Francis scored 113—against Newberry College .
He scored his 99th and 100th points on a 40-foot shot as the final buzzer sounded .
Professionally , there have been a number of occurrences of 100-point games worldwide .
It has only happened once in the United States , however .
Wilt
Chamberlain of the National Basketball Association 's Philadelphia Warriors scored 100 points on March 2 , 1962 against the New York Knicks during a game played at Hersheypark Arena in Hershey , Pennsylvania .
He made 36-of-63 field goals and 28-of-32 free throws , the latter being a particularly unusual statistic considering Chamberlain was a 51.1 % free throw shooter for his career .
