HISTORY 1964–1977 Section::::History .
Section::::1964–1977 .
Lynyrd Skynyrd was formed under the name My Backyard in 1964 , which was later changed to The Noble Five , and again to One Percent .
The group originally included vocalist Ronnie Van Zant , guitarists Gary Rossington and Allen Collins , bassist Larry Junstrom and drummer Bob Burns , all of whom were students at Robert E. Lee High School .
After performing live for several years , the band recorded for the first time in 1971 , when Junstrom and Burns were replaced by Greg T. Walker and Rickey Medlocke , respectively .
The following year , Walker was replaced by the band 's original choice of bassist Leon Wilkeson , and Medlocke moved to third guitarist as Burns returned on drums .
Medlocke had left by the end of the year .
Billy Powell had also been added as the group 's first keyboardist , having worked as a roadie since 1970 .
Shortly before recording began for the band 's debut album ( Pronounced ' Lĕh-'nérd ' Skin-'nérd ) , Wilkeson left Lynyrd Skynyrd and was replaced by Ed King .
Later during the sessions the bassist returned , with King subsequently taking up the role of third guitarist .
Burns remained for 1974 's Second Helping , but left in January 1975 due to touring fatigue , with Artimus Pyle taking his place .
King left on May 26 , 1975 , two months after the release of Nuthin' Fancy .
He was replaced the following year by Steve Gaines , who was recommended by his sister Cassie Gaines after she had recently joined as one of the band 's touring backing vocalists .
On October 20 , 1977 – three days after the release of the band 's fifth studio album Street Survivors – a chartered plane on which the members and crew were travelling crashed in Gillsburg , Mississippi .
Six people died in the accident , including band members Ronnie Van Zant , Steve Gaines and Cassie Gaines ; many of the other passengers onboard were seriously injured , including Wilkeson who was left in a critical condition and reportedly declared dead three times .
The group disbanded after the crash .
In 1978 , a collection of previously unreleased recordings from 1971 and 1972 was released as Skynyrd 's First and ...
Last .
The following year , the surviving members ( with the exception of Wilkeson ) reunited at Volunteer Jam for a performance of " Free Bird " with Charlie Daniels and his band .
1987
ONWARDS Section::::1987
onwards .
In July 1987 , Lynyrd Skynyrd announced their reforming for the Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour , with returning members Rossington , King , Wilkeson , Pyle and Powell joined by new lead vocalist Johnny Van Zant , Ronnie 's younger brother .
Collins was unable to join the reunited group after a car accident the previous year which left him paralyzed from the waist down , choosing Randall Hall from his own eponymous band to take his place on guitar .
After the band 's first post - reformation studio album Lynyrd Skynyrd 1991 , Pyle left suddenly after a show in August , with Kurt Custer taking his place .
Hall left in 1993 after the release of The Last Rebel , later suing the remaining members of the band for $ 500,000 .
Custer followed Hall out of the group the next year in order to focus on his solo career .
Hall and Custer were replaced by Mike Estes and Owen Hale , respectively , both of whom performed on the 1994 album Endangered Species .
King was forced to leave the band in 1996 due to health problems , with Hughie Thomasson brought in to take his place ; Estes left around the same time , with former drummer Medlocke returning to the band on guitar as a result .
Hale left in late 1998 after the Twenty Tour ; he was replaced first by Jeff McAllister , followed by Kenny Aronoff who played on Edge of Forever , before Michael Cartellone took over in 1999 after the dissolution of the Damn Yankees .
On July 27 , 2001 , longtime bassist Leon Wilkeson died in his sleep of natural causes .
He was replaced by Ean Evans , who had earlier substituted for Wilkeson at several shows the previous year .
Thomasson left Lynyrd Skynyrd in 2005 to reform his previous band Outlaws , with his replacement Mark Matejka joining early the next year .
The band was forced to change its lineup twice in 2009 due to deaths in the group – first , longtime keyboardist Billy Powell died of a heart attack on January 28 ; and later , bassist Evans died of cancer on May 6 .
Peter Keys was later brought in to replace Powell , while Evans was replaced by Robert Kearns .
Kearns remained until 2012 , when he was replaced by former Black Crowes bassist Johnny Colt .
Keith Christopher replaced Colt in mid-2017 .
