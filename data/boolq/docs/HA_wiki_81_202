BACKGROUND Section::::Background .
The Wizard of Oz was first turned into a musical extravaganza by Baum himself .
A loose adaptation of his 1900 novel ( there is no Wicked Witch or Toto , and there are some new characters ) , it first played in Chicago in 1902 and was a success on Broadway the following year .
It then toured for nine years .
The 1939 film adaptation bore a closer resemblance to the storyline of Baum 's original novel than most previous versions .
It was a strong success , winning the Academy Awards for Best Original Song and Original Score , and continues to be broadcast perennially .
Among the many musical theatre adaptations of The Wizard of Oz , two previous ones have used the songs from the film .
In 1945 , the St. Louis Municipal Opera ( MUNY ) created a version with a script adapted by Frank Gabrielson from the novel , but it is influenced in some respects by the motion picture screenplay .
It uses most of the songs from the film .
This was followed , in 1987 , by a Royal Shakespeare Company ( RSC ) adaptation designed to more closely recreate the film version .
The book by John Kane closely follows the film 's screenplay , and it and uses nearly all of the film 's music .
Both the MUNY and RSC adaptations were successes and have been revived numerous times in the US and UK .
The Wizard of Oz is Andrew Lloyd Webber 's 18th musical .
Tim Rice first collaborated with Lloyd Webber in 1965 , together writing The Likes of Us .
Their next piece was Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat , followed by two more concept albums that became hit musicals , Jesus Christ Superstar ( 1971 ) and Evita ( 1978 ) .
Except for a special collaboration for Queen Elizabeth 's 60th birthday celebration , the musical Cricket in 1986 , after Evita , each man turned to other collaborators to produce further well - known musical theatre works .
The Wizard of Oz was Rice and Lloyd Webber 's first production together in the West End in over three decades .
To create the new musical , Lloyd Webber and director Jeremy Sams adapted the 1939 film 's screenplay , and Rice and Lloyd Webber added several new songs to the film 's score .
In 2010 , Lloyd Webber told the Daily Mail , " The fact is that The Wizard of Oz has never really worked in the theatre .
The film has one or two holes where in the theatre you need a song .
For example , there 's nothing for either of the two witches to sing . "
He also commented " Tim
and I are doing quite a specific thing , because we know what 's missing . "

CAST ALBUM
Section::::Cast album .
A cast album , featuring the songs from the original production , was released as a CD and digital download on 9 May 2011 .
RECEPTION Section::::Reception .
Opening night reviews were mixed but generally praised the designs , the special effects and several cast members , especially Waddingham .
The Telegraph reviewer , Charles Spencer , rated the production three out of five stars , writing : " Jeremy Sams 's production pulls out all the stops , with ingenious designs by Robert Jones that skilfully conjure up both the sepia world of Kansas and the lurid colours of Oz .
Dorothy 's flight to the enchanted land is thrillingly caught with the help of film effects that would n't look out of place on Doctor Who and the story is told with clarity and pace " , but added that Hope " offers a thoroughly competent rather than an inspired performance " that " lacks the heart - catching vulnerability of the young Judy Garland " .
Paul Taylor of The Independent gave the show four out of five stars , commenting : " Jeremy Sams 's production is a marvel of beguiling narrative fluency and , with Robert Jones 's superb designs , of endlessly witty and spectacular visual invention â from the digitally - enhanced hurricane transition to Oz to the skeletally twisted Gothic palace of the Wicked Witch and her totalitarian , helmeted guards . "
Henry Hitchings of the London Evening Standard also gave the show four out of five stars , praising Jones 's " lavish costumes and lovingly conceived sets . ...
The story is lucid and well - paced , though the technological wizardry occasionally obscures its inherent magic . ...
Danielle Hope ... makes a winning impression .
Her performance combines innocence with easy charm , and her voice soars . "
Although Michael Billington , the reviewer at The Guardian , felt " blitzkrieged rather than charmed " , he gave the production three stars out of five , writing : " The star of the show is undoubtedly the set and costume designer , Robert Jones .
The Kansas cyclone that whisks Dorothy into a dreamworld is evoked through vorticist projections ( the work of Jon Driscoll ) that betoken chaos in the cosmos .
The Yellow Brick Road is on a tilted revolve from inside which poppyfields and labyrinthine forest emerge .
The Emerald City is full of steeply inclined walls suggesting a drunkard 's vision of the Chrysler Building lobby .
And the Wicked Witch of the West inhabits a rotating dungeon that might be a Piranesi nightmare . ...
Of course , there are the songs ; it 's good to be reminded of such classics as " Over The Rainbow " , " We 're Off
To See The Wizard " , and " Follow The Yellow Brick Road " .
The additions by Lloyd Webber and Rice are also perfectly acceptable .
Dorothy is given a good plaintive opening number , and Red Shoes Blues , sung by the Wicked Witch , has a pounding intensity . "
Writing in the Daily Mail , Quentin Letts felt that " the story lacks the emotive motor of a love affair " and that the " dramatic buzz " is " not much better than you 'd find at a decent pantomime " .
The Oxford Times reviewed the production during Evans 's first week ( in May 2011 ) replacing the vacationing Hope , calling the show " hugely enjoyable " and commenting of Evans : " Such is her success in the role that it would be hard to imagine anyone could consider they were getting second - best .
