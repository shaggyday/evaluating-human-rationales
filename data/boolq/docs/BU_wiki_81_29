HISTORY ORIGINS Section::::History .
Section::::Origins .
The recipe for the soft drink
Pepsi was first developed in the 1880s by Caleb Bradham , a pharmacist and industrialist from New Bern , North Carolina .
He coined the name " Pepsi - Cola " in 1898 .
As the cola developed in popularity , he created the Pepsi - Cola Company in 1902 and registered a patent for his recipe in 1903 .
The Pepsi - Cola Company was first incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1919 .
The company went bankrupt in 1931 and on June 8 of that year , the trademark and syrup recipe were purchased by Charles Guth , who owned a syrup manufacturing business in Baltimore .
Guth was also the president of Loft , Incorporated , a leading candy manufacturer , and he used the company 's labs and chemists to reformulate the syrup .
He further contracted to stock the soda in Loft 's large chain of candy shops and restaurants , which were known for their soda fountains , used Loft resources to promote Pepsi , and moved the soda company to a location close by Loft 's own facilities in New York City .
In 1935 , the shareholders of Loft sued Guth for his 91 % stake of Pepsi - Cola Company in the landmark case Guth v.
Loft Inc. Loft won the suit and on May 29 , 1941 formally absorbed Pepsi into Loft , which was then re - branded as Pepsi - Cola Company that same year .
Loft restaurants and candy stores were spun off at this time .
In the early 1960s , Pepsi - Cola 's product lines expanded with the creation of Diet Pepsi and purchase of Mountain Dew .
In 1965 , the Pepsi - Cola Company merged with Frito - Lay , Inc. to become PepsiCo ,
Inc. At the time of its foundation , PepsiCo was incorporated in the state of Delaware and headquartered in Manhattan , New York .
The company 's headquarters were relocated to the present location of Purchase , New York in 1970 , and in 1986 PepsiCo was reincorporated in the state of North Carolina .
After 39 years trading on the NYSE , PepsiCo moved its shares to Nasdaq on December 20 , 2017 .
ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTMENTS Section::::Acquisitions and divestments .
Between the late-1970s and the mid-1990s , PepsiCo expanded via acquisition of businesses outside of its core focus of packaged food and beverage brands ; however it exited these non - core business lines largely in 1997 , selling some , and spinning off others into a new company named Tricon Global Restaurants , which later became known as Yum !
Brands ,
Inc. PepsiCo also previously owned several other brands that it later sold so it could focus on its primary snack food and beverage lines , according to investment analysts reporting on the divestments in 1997 .
Brands formerly owned by PepsiCo include : Pizza Hut , Taco Bell , KFC , Hot ' n
Now , East Side Mario 's , D'Angelo Sandwich Shops , Chevys Fresh Mex , California Pizza Kitchen ,
Stolichnaya ( via licensed agreement ) , Wilson Sporting Goods , and North American Van Lines .
The divestments concluding in 1997 were followed by multiple large - scale acquisitions , as PepsiCo began to extend its operations beyond soft drinks and snack foods into other lines of foods and beverages .
PepsiCo purchased the orange juice company Tropicana Products in 1998 , and merged with Quaker Oats Company in 2001 , adding with it the Gatorade sports drink line and other Quaker Oats brands such as Chewy Granola Bars and Aunt Jemima , among others .
In August 2009 , PepsiCo made a $ 7 billion offer to acquire the two largest bottlers of its products in North America : Pepsi Bottling Group and PepsiAmericas .
In 2010 this acquisition was completed , resulting in the formation of a new wholly owned subsidiary of PepsiCo , Pepsi Beverages Company .
In February 2011 , the company made its largest international acquisition by purchasing a two - thirds ( majority ) stake in Wimm - Bill - Dann Foods , a Russian food company that produces milk , yogurt , fruit juices , and dairy products .
When it acquired the remaining 23 % stake of Wimm - Bill - Dann Foods in October 2011 , PepsiCo became the largest food and beverage company in Russia .
In July 2012 , PepsiCo announced a joint venture with the Theo Muller Group which was named Muller Quaker Dairy .
This marked PepsiCo 's first entry into the dairy space in the U.S.
The joint venture was dissolved in December 2015 .
On May 25 , 2018 , PepsiCo announced that it would acquire fruit and veggie snack maker Bare Foods .
It will also quarter - own allMotti in late November 2018
and it will be PepsiCo 's first owned Tech and Computer Service company .

The purchase is expected to close by January 2019 as part of a strategic plan to steer Pepsi toward offering healthier products .
COMPETITION Section::::Competition .
The Coca - Cola Company has historically been considered PepsiCo 's primary competitor in the beverage market , and in December 2005 , PepsiCo surpassed The Coca - Cola Company in market value for the first time in 112 years since both companies began to compete .
In 2009 , The Coca - Cola Company held a higher market share in carbonated soft drink sales within the U.S.
In the same year , PepsiCo maintained a higher share of the U.S. refreshment beverage market , however , reflecting the differences in product lines between the two companies .
As a result of mergers , acquisitions , and partnerships pursued by PepsiCo in the 1990s and 2000s , its business has shifted to include a broader product base , including foods , snacks , and beverages .
The majority of PepsiCo 's revenues no longer come from the production and sale of carbonated soft drinks .
Beverages accounted for less than 50 percent of its total revenue in 2009 .
In the same year , slightly more than 60 percent of PepsiCo 's beverage sales came from its primary non - carbonated brands , namely Gatorade and Tropicana .
PepsiCo 's Frito - Lay and Quaker Oats brands hold a significant share of the U.S. snack food market , accounting for approximately 39 percent of U.S. snack food sales in 2009 .
One of PepsiCo 's primary competitors in the snack food market overall is Kraft Foods , which in the same year held 11 percent of the U.S. snack market share .
Other competitors for soda are RC Cola , Cola Turka , Kola Real , Inca Kola , Zamzam Cola , Mecca - Cola , Virgin Cola , Qibla Cola , Evoca Cola , Corsica Cola , Breizh Cola , and Afri Cola .
SOVIET UNION Section::::Soviet Union .
In 1959 , the USSR held an exhibition of Soviet technology and culture in New York .
The United States reciprocated with an exhibition in Sokolniki Park , Moscow , which led to the famous kitchen debate .
One of the American products exhibited was Pepsi Cola .
After obtaining a photo of U.S. President Richard Nixon and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev sipping Pepsi , Pepsico executive Donald Kendall was able to capture the attention of the Soviet people and , in 1972 , negotiate a cola monopoly in the USSR .
Due to Soviet restrictions on transporting rubles abroad , PepsiCo struck a barter deal whereby Stolichnaya vodka would be exchanged for Pepsi syrup .
This deal lasted until 1990 , when the USSR and PepsiCo re - negotiated to exchange syrup for vodka and a small fleet of Soviet warships including 17 submarines , a frigate , a cruiser and a destroyer .

ENVIRONMENTAL RECORD AND PRODUCT NUTRITION
Section::::Environmental record and product nutrition .
According to its 2009 annual report , PepsiCo states that it is " committed to delivering sustainable growth by investing in a healthier future for people and our planet , " which it has defined in its mission statement since 2006 as " Performance with Purpose " .
According to news and magazine coverage on the subject in 2010 , the objective of this initiative is to increase the number and variety of healthier food and beverage products made available to its customers , employ a reduction in the company 's environmental impact , and to facilitate diversity and healthy lifestyles within its employee base .
Its activities in regards to the pursuit of its goals — namely environmental impacts of production and the nutritional composition of its products — have been the subject of recognition from health and environmental advocates and organizations , and at times have raised concerns among its critics .
As the result of a more recent focus on such efforts , " critics consider ( PepsiCo ) to be perhaps the most proactive and progressive of the food companies " , according to former New York Times food industry writer Melanie Warner in 2010 .
ENVIRONMENTAL RECORD RAINFORESTS AND PALM OIL
Section::::Environmental record .
Section::::Rainforests and palm oil .
PepsiCo Palm Oil Commitments published in May 2014 were welcomed by media as a positive step towards ensuring that the company 's palm oil purchases will not contribute to deforestation and human rights abuses in the palm oil industry .
NGOs warned that the commitments did not go far enough , and in light of the deforestation crisis in Southeast Asia , have called on the company to close the gaps in its policies immediately .
GENETICALLY MODIFIED
FOOD INGREDIENTS
Section::::Genetically Modified Food Ingredients .
PepsiCo has contributed $ 1,716,300 to oppose the passage of California Proposition 37 , which would mandate the disclosure of genetically modified crops used in the production of California food products .
PepsiCo believes " that genetically - modified products can play a role in generating positive economic , social and environmental contributions to societies around the world ; particularly in times of food shortages . "
WATER USAGE ( INDIA , U.S. , U.K. )
Section::::Water usage ( India , U.S. , U.K. ) .
PepsiCo 's usage of water was the subject of controversy in India in the early and mid-2000s , in part because of the company 's alleged impact on water usage in a country where water shortages are a perennial issue .
In this setting , PepsiCo was perceived by India - based environmental organizations as a company that diverted water to manufacture a discretionary product , making it a target for critics at the time .
As a result , in 2003 PepsiCo launched a country - wide program to achieve a " positive water balance " in India by 2009 .
In 2007 , PepsiCo 's CEO Indra Nooyi made a trip to India to address water usage practices in the country , prompting prior critic Sunita Narain , director of the Centre for Science & Environment ( CSE ) , to note that PepsiCo " seem(s ) to be doing something serious about water now . "
According to the company 's 2009 corporate citizenship report , as well as media reports at the time , the company ( in 2009 ) replenished nearly six billion liters of water within India , exceeding the aggregate water intake of approximately five billion liters by PepsiCo 's India manufacturing facilities .
Water usage concerns have arisen at times in other countries where PepsiCo operates .
In the U.S. , water shortages in certain regions resulted in increased scrutiny on the company 's production facilities , which were cited in media reports as being among the largest water users in cities facing drought — such as Atlanta , Georgia .
In response , the company formed partnerships with non - profit organizations such as the Earth Institute and Water.org , and in 2009 began cleaning new Gatorade bottles with purified air instead of rinsing with water , among other water conservation practices .
In the United Kingdom , also in response to regional drought conditions , PepsiCo snacks brand Walkers ' reduced water usage at its largest potato chip facility by 45 percent between the years 2001 and 2008 .
In doing so , the factory used machinery that captured water naturally contained in potatoes , and used it to offset the need for outside water .
As a result of water reduction practices and efficiency improvements , PepsiCo in 2009 saved more than 12 billion liters of water worldwide , compared to its 2006 water usage .
Environmental advocacy organizations including the Natural Resources Defense Council and individual critics such as Rocky Anderson ( mayor of Salt Lake City , Utah ) voiced concerns in 2009 , noting that the company could conserve additional water by refraining from the production of discretionary products such as Aquafina .
The company maintained its positioning of bottled water as " healthy and convenient " , while also beginning to partially offset environmental impacts of such products through alternate means , including packaging weight reduction .
PESTICIDE REGULATION ( INDIA )
Section::::Pesticide regulation ( India ) .
PepsiCo 's India operations were met with substantial resistance in 2003 and again in 2006 , when an environmental organization in New Delhi made the claim that , based on its research , it believed that the levels of pesticides in PepsiCo ( along with those from rival The Coca - Cola Company ) , exceeded a set of proposed safety standards on soft drink ingredients that had been developed by the Bureau of Indian Standards .
PepsiCo denied the allegations , and India 's health ministry has also dismissed the allegations — both questioning the accuracy of the data compiled by the CSE , as it was tested by its own internal laboratories without being verified by outside peer review .
The ensuing dispute prompted a short - lived ban on the sale of PepsiCo and The Coca - Cola Company soft drinks within India 's southwestern state of Kerala in 2006 ; however this ban was reversed by the Kerala High Court one month later .
In November 2010 , the Supreme Court of India invalidated a criminal complaint filed against PepsiCo India by the Kerala government , on the basis that the beverages did meet local standards at the time of the allegations .
The court ruling stated that the " percentage of pesticides " found in the tested beverages was " within the tolerance limits subsequently prescribed in respect of such product , " since at the time of testing " there was no provision governing pesticide adulteration in cold drinks . "
In 2010 , PepsiCo was among the 12 multinational companies that displayed " the most impressive corporate social responsibility credentials in emerging markets " , as determined by the U.S. Department of State .
PepsiCo 's India unit received recognition on the basis of its water conservation and safety practices and corresponding results .
PACKAGING AND RECYCLING Section::::Packaging and recycling .
Environmental advocates have raised concern over the environmental impacts surrounding the disposal of PepsiCo 's bottled beverage products in particular , as bottle recycling rates for the company 's products in 2009 averaged 34 percent within the U.S.
The company has employed efforts to minimize these environmental impacts via packaging developments combined with recycling initiatives .
In 2010 , PepsiCo announced a goal to create partnerships that prompt an increase in the beverage container recycling rate in the U.S. to 50 percent by 2018 .
One strategy enacted to reach this goal has been the placement of interactive recycling kiosks called " Dream Machines " in supermarkets , convenience stores , and gas stations , with the intent of increasing access to recycling receptacles .
The use of resin to manufacture its plastic bottles has resulted in reduced packaging weight , which in turn reduces the volume of fossil fuels required to transport certain PepsiCo products .
The weight of Aquafina bottles was reduced nearly 40 percent , to 15 grams , with a packaging redesign in 2009 .
Also in that year , PepsiCo brand Naked Juice began production and distribution of the first 100 percent post - consumer recycled plastic bottle .
On March 15 , 2011 , PepsiCo unveiled the world 's first plant - based PET bottle .
The bottle is made from plant - based materials , such as switch grass , corn husks , and pine bark , and is 100 % recyclable .
PepsiCo plans to reuse more by - products of its manufacturing processes such as orange peels and oat hulls in the bottles .
PepsiCo has identified methods to create a molecular structure that is the same as normal petroleum - based PET — which will make the new bottle technology , dubbed " Green Bottle " , feel the same as normal PET .
PepsiCo will pilot production in 2012 , and upon successful completion of the pilot , intends moving to full - scale commercialization .
ENERGY USAGE AND CARBON FOOTPRINT
Section::::Energy usage and carbon footprint .
PepsiCo , along with other manufacturers in its industry , has drawn criticism from environmental advocacy groups for the production and distribution of plastic product packaging , which consumed an additional of petrochemicals in 2008 .
These critics have also expressed apprehension over the production volume of plastic packaging , which results in the emission of carbon dioxide .
Beginning largely in 2006 , PepsiCo began development of more efficient means of producing and distributing its products using less energy , while also placing a focus on emissions reduction .
In a comparison of 2009 energy usage with recorded usage in 2006 , the company 's per - unit use of energy was reduced by 16 percent in its beverage plants and 7 percent in snack plants .
In 2009 , Tropicana ( owned by PepsiCo ) was the first brand in the U.S. to determine the carbon footprint of its orange juice product , as certified by the Carbon Trust , an outside auditor of carbon emissions .
Also in 2009 , PepsiCo began the test deployment of so - called " green vending machines " , which reduce energy usage by 15 percent in comparison to average models in use .
It developed these machines in coordination with Greenpeace , which described the initiative as " transforming the industry in a way that is going to be more climate - friendly to a great degree . "
PRODUCT NUTRITION
PRODUCT DIVERSITY
Section::::Product nutrition .
Section::::Product diversity .
From its founding in 1965 until the early 1990s , the majority of PepsiCo 's product line consisted of carbonated soft drinks and convenience snacks .
PepsiCo broadened its product line substantially throughout the 1990s and 2000s with the acquisition and development of what its CEO deemed as " good - for - you " products , including Quaker Oats , Naked Juice , and Tropicana orange juice .
Sales of such healthier - oriented PepsiCo brands totaled $ 10 billion in 2009 , representing 18 percent of the company 's total revenue in that year .
This movement into a broader , healthier product range has been moderately well received by nutrition advocates ; though commentators in this field have also suggested that PepsiCo market its healthier items as aggressively as less - healthy core products .
In response to shifting consumer preferences and in part due to increasing governmental regulation , PepsiCo in 2010 indicated its intention to grow this segment of its business , forecasting that sales of fruit , vegetable , whole grain , and fiber - based products will amount to $ 30 billion by 2020 .
To meet this intended target , the company has said that it plans to acquire additional health - oriented brands while also making changes to the composition of existing products that it sells .
INGREDIENT CHANGES IN PEPSI Section::::Ingredient changes in Pepsi .
Public health advocates have suggested that there may be a link between the ingredient makeup of PepsiCo 's core snack and carbonated soft drink products and rising rates of health conditions such as obesity and diabetes .
The company aligns with personal responsibility advocates , who assert that food and beverages with higher proportions of sugar or salt content are fit for consumption in moderation by individuals who also exercise on a regular basis .
Changes to the composition of its products with nutrition in mind have involved reducing fat content , moving away from trans - fats , and producing products in calorie - specific serving sizes to discourage overconsumption , among other changes .
One of the earlier ingredient changes involved sugar and caloric reduction , with the introduction of Diet Pepsi in 1964 and Pepsi Max in 1993—both of which are variants of their full - calorie counterpart , Pepsi .
More recent changes have consisted of saturated fat reduction , which Frito - Lay reduced by 50 % in Lay 's and Ruffles potato chips in the U.S. between 2006 and 2009 .
Also in 2009 , PepsiCo 's Tropicana brand introduced a new variation of orange juice ( Trop50 ) sweetened in part by the plant Stevia , which reduced calories by half .
Since 2007 , the company also made available lower - calorie variants of Gatorade , which it calls " G2 " .
On May 5 , 2014 , PepsiCo announced that the company would remove the flame retardant chemical known as " Brominated Vegetable Oil " from many of its products , but a time - frame was not discussed .
DISTRIBUTION TO CHILDREN Section::::Distribution to children .
As public perception placed additional scrutiny on the marketing and distribution of carbonated soft drinks to children , PepsiCo announced in 2010 that by 2012 , it will remove beverages with higher sugar content from primary and secondary schools worldwide .
It also , under voluntary guidelines adopted in 2006 , replaced " full - calorie " beverages in U.S. schools with " lower - calorie " alternatives , leading to a 95 percent reduction in the 2009 sales of full - calorie variants in these schools in comparison to the sales recorded in 2004 .
In 2008 , in accordance with guidelines adopted by the International Council of Beverages Associations , PepsiCo eliminated the advertising and marketing of products that do not meet its nutrition standards , to children under the age of 12 .
In 2010 , First Lady Michelle Obama initiated a campaign to end childhood obesity ( titled Let 's Move ! ) , in which she sought to encourage healthier food options in public schools , improved food nutrition labeling , and increased physical activity for children .
In response to this initiative , PepsiCo , along with food manufacturers Campbell Soup , Coca - Cola , General Mills , and others in an alliance referred to as the " Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation " , announced in 2010 that the companies will collectively cut one trillion calories from their products sold by the end of 2012 and 1.5 trillion calories by the end of 2015 .
