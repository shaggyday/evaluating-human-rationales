On January 13 , 2013 , the President of The CW Mark Pedowitz stated that although 90210 does n't have a season 6 renewal in place , the show would most likely be back next year ( possibly for the final season if it were to be canceled ) due to him being a " big believer in giving fans a very satisfactory conclusion " for long - running shows .

RECEPTION CRITICAL RECEPTION Section::::Reception .
Section::::Critical reception .
Zap2it thought that Teddy and Silver having a baby together is a " weird thing to happen , but we 're not complaining about anything that means we 'll have Trevor Donovan on our TV screens for an undetermined amount of episodes . "
TV Equals 's , Kristen Elizabeth thought that Dixon had become unnecessary ; " I just feel like he 's superfluous at this point . "
She also predicted Naomi will sleep with Max 's business partner , Alec ; " Sorry , it 's nothing personal .
Girl just has a bad track record . "
The Series finale , " We All Fall Down " , marks the end of the show with mixed feelings from both critics and fans , and the cast .
AnnaLynne McCord took the time to write to the fans on Twitter , and also going on saying , " It was a shocker .
We found out via Twitter — that was n't cool at all .
"
This because of the notice the show was ending late in the shooting of the episode ( planned as a Season finale ) , and the showrunners had little time to re - elaborate the storylines .
Particularly , the un - satisfying ending for the character of Silver led to a serious backlash from fans and critics for the little resolution of the character after losing the baby and getting the news of cancer right in the middle of the episode .
This was because Jessica Stroup already shot the entire Silver 's act , with the writers unable to re - write her story .
Later , Lara Olsen , showrunner for the final two years of the show , explained that " in a perfect world , we wanted Silver to find out Michaela lost her baby [ ... ] , then that she was pregnant with Mark 's baby , and not with cancer .
" The same fate goes for AnnaLynne McCord 's character , Naomi Clark .
The actress , disappointed with how the series was ending for the character she portrayed for five seasons , decided to shoot her own ending as a thank you to the fans posting the video on YouTube a few minutes after the finale was aired .
Matt Lanter ( Liam ) , also speculated on the hypothetical and final sixth season that was promised but never got , saying that " we had a whole different [ season finale ] planned .
We aged our characters five years in the potential sixth season .
Liam had just gotten out of jail , and Naomi was on a private jet flying back to pick him up .
She got him out of jail and said , " Officer , I 'm here to pick up my husband , Liam Court , "
and I walked up to her and said something like , " Hello , Mrs. Court " and it actually ended right there . "
Critics also reviewed negatively the writing of the past two seasons , particularly , The A.V. Club noted how the tone of the series shifted in the final two seasons ( with the transition from showrunner Rebecca Sinclair at the end of season 3 to Patti Carr and Lara Olsen ) , saying " The first few seasons had fitfully entertaining moments — Annie 's hit - and - run homicide , Teddy 's coming out story , and Adrianna 's descent into absolute narcissism and madness were standouts — and the third season chronicling the characters ' senior year was actually a highly enjoyable lark , as the show finally figured out it could have a little bit of fun amid the constant misery .
But then the cast graduated , and that 's when everything just went to hell .
"
It went on criticizing the lack of resolution for Silver , adding : "
[ Her ] quest to have a child before she is stricken by the breast cancer that 's inevitably coming to kill her ( I know ) , was the one thing that was n't wrapped up at all .
Silver 's surrogate lost her baby last week , which is tragic , and in the finale , she learns that on top of that , her potential cancer has turned into a full - blown malignancy .
Will Silver die ?
Who knows , because there just is n't time to find out .
The majority of the finale dealt with giving anyone who was n't Silver a happy ending , which is nice fan service but not all that interesting .
" They also questioned if the fan - service reuniting the core couples from previous seasons was a smart move , " I suppose , if you are one of those people who are still shipping yourself with whomever
you had a crush on in high school .
More egregiously , the finale acts like Annie and Liam is the ultimate endgame for the show , the couple fans are most interested in , to which I say " Really ? "
Are people so invested in this couple who have n't spent significant time dating since season three ?
Are they so invested that the big ending of Liam chasing down a plane with his motorcycle in order to propose to Annie
is how they wanted this to finish up ? "
On TVFanatic and Zap2it were more positive about it , noting the writers did n't have time to wrap things up .
