HOME EQUITY Home equity is the market value of a homeowner 's unencumbered interest in their real property , that is , the difference between the home 's fair market value and the outstanding balance of all liens on the property .
The property 's equity increases as the debtor makes payments against the mortgage balance , or as the property value appreciates .
In economics , home equity is sometimes called real property value .
Home equity is not liquid .
Home equity management refers to the process of using equity extraction via loans , at favorable , and often tax - favored , interest rates , to invest otherwise illiquid equity in a target that offers higher returns .
Homeowners acquire equity in their home from two sources .
They purchase equity with their down payment and the principal portion of any payments they make against their mortgage .
They also benefit from a gain in equity when the value of the property increases .
Investors typically look to purchase properties that will grow in value , causing the equity in the property to increase , thus providing a return on their investment when the property is sold .
Home equity may serve as collateral for a home equity loan or home equity line of credit ( HELOC ) .
Many home equity plans set a fixed period during which the homeowner can borrow money , such as ten years .
At the end of this " draw period , " the borrower may be allowed to renew the credit line .
If the plan does not allow renewals , the borrower will not be able to borrow additional money once the period has ended .
Some plans may call for payment in full of any outstanding balance at the end of the period .
Others may allow repayment over a fixed period , for example , ten years .
