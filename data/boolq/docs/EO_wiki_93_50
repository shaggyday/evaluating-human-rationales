POSTAL HOLIDAY
In the United States , a Postal holiday is a Federal holiday recognized by the United States Postal Service , during which no mail is delivered .
Though letter carriers have the day off , some postal workers are forced to work on holidays , such as clerks dispatching mail , or those working in plant distribution facilities .
Some plant facilities operate 365 days a year .
Part 608 , section 3.2 of the DMM ( U.S. Domestic Mail Manual ) groups holidays into " Widely Observed " and " Not Widely Observed " .
Holidays " Widely Observed " include New Year 's Day , Memorial Day , Independence Day , Labor Day , Veteran 's day , Thanksgiving Day , and Christmas Day .
Holidays " Not Widely Observed " are Martin Luther King , Jr. 's Birthday ; Presidents Day ; Columbus Day ; and Veterans Day .
If a holiday occurs on Sunday , service will be observed on Monday .
