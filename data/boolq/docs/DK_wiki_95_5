WALTER PAYTON
Walter Jerry Payton ( July 25 , 1954 – November 1 , 1999 ) was an American football running back who played for the Chicago Bears of the National Football League ( NFL ) for thirteen seasons .
Payton was known around the NFL as " Sweetness " .
A nine - time Pro Bowl selectee , Payton is remembered as a prolific rusher , once holding records for career rushing yards , touchdowns , carries , yards from scrimmage , all - purpose yards , and many other categories .
He was also versatile , and retired with the most receptions by a non - receiver , and had eight career touchdown passes .
He was elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1993 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1996 .
Hall of Fame NFL player and coach Mike Ditka described Payton as the greatest football player he had ever seen — but even greater as a human being .
Payton began his football career in Mississippi , and went on to have an outstanding collegiate football career at Jackson State University where he was an All - American .
He started his professional career with the Chicago Bears in 1975 , who selected him with the 1975 Draft 's fourth overall pick .
Payton proceeded to win the 1977 AP NFL Most Valuable Player Award and won Super Bowl XX with the 1985 Chicago Bears .
He retired from football at the end of the 1987 season having rushed for at least 1,200 yards in 10 of his 13 seasons in the NFL .
After struggling with the rare liver disease primary sclerosing cholangitis for several months , Payton died on November 1 , 1999 , aged 45 , from cholangiocarcinoma .
His legacy includes the Walter Payton Award , the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award , and a heightened awareness of the need for organ donations .
EARLY LIFE
Section::::Early life .
Payton was one of three children born to Peter and Alyne Payton in Columbia , Mississippi .
His father was a factory worker who had played semi - professional baseball .
Payton was an active member of the Boy Scouts , Little League , and his local church .
At John J. Jefferson High School , Payton played drums in the marching band , participated in the track team and sang in the school choir .
Outside of school , he played drums in jazz - rock groups .
His brother Eddie was on the football team , and Payton did not play partly to avoid competing with him .
After Eddie graduated , the football coach asked Payton to try out for the team , and he agreed on condition that he be allowed to continue playing in the band .
Once he began to play football , as a junior , he achieved instant success as a running back , running 65 yards for a touchdown on his first high school carry .
At , he was not especially large , but his speed and strength made him one of the team 's featured players .
John J. Jefferson High School was integrated with neighboring Columbia High School that year ; Payton and his teammates were upset that their head coach , Charles L. Boston , had become an assistant and Payton boycotted some of the spring practices in protest , but returned during the fall season .
He then earned statewide honors as a member of Mississippi 's all - state team , leading Columbia to an unexpected 8–2 season .
His performance helped ease the local tensions surrounding desegregation .
Tommy Davis , Columbia 's football coach , claimed that he could always count on Payton when the team needed to score .
Payton 's statistics proved that was no exaggeration : he scored in every game during his junior and senior years .
He was named to the all - conference team two years in a row .
Payton also led the Little Dixie Conference in scoring his senior year and made the all - state team .
In addition to excelling at football , Payton averaged 18 points a game for Columbia 's basketball team , leaped three - quarters of an inch short of 23 feet in the long jump , played baseball , and continued to drum in the school band .
COLLEGE CAREER
Section::::College career .
Though Payton had established himself as one of Mississippi 's best running back prospects , he received no invitations from Southeastern Conference colleges , which accepted few black players at the time .
After originally committing to Kansas State University , he decided to pursue his collegiate career at the historically black school Jackson State University ( MS ) where his older brother Eddie played football .
He was never recruited by the University of Kansas , according to then - coach Don Fambrough as Payton claimed in his autobiography .
While attending Jackson State , Payton played alongside many future professional football players , including Jerome Barkum , Robert Brazile , and Jackie Slater .
As a member of the Jackson State Tigers , Payton rushed for more than 3,500 yards , averaging 6.1 yards per carry , and set the school record for career rushing touchdowns with 65 .
In 1973 , Payton had a school record 24 rushing touchdowns , and was named Black College Player of the Year .
He won this award again in 1974 , in addition to being selected for the All - American Team .
Payton graduated in 1975 with a Bachelor 's degree in Communications .
He acquired the nickname " Sweetness " in college .
The nickname 's origin is ambiguous : it is variously said to have stemmed from his personality , from his athletic grace , or as a sarcastic description of his aggressive playing style .
Payton was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1996 , and posthumously inducted into the inaugural class of the Black College Football Hall of Fame in 2010 .
BREAKOUT PERFORMANCE Section::::Breakout performance .
On October 1 , 1972 , during Payton 's sophomore year , he set a then - best SWAC single - game scoring record by rushing for seven touchdowns ( on runs of 6 , 8 , 2 , 3 , 1 , 2 , and 31 yards ) and two 2-point conversions for 46 points as Jackson State crushed Lane College , 72–0 .
He also set a school record with 279 rushing yards in the game .
STATISTICS PROFESSIONAL CAREER 1975–1982 Section::::Professional career .
Section::::1975–1982 .
The Chicago Bears drafted Walter Payton in the first round of the 1975 NFL Draft , as the fourth overall pick .
The Bears had endured several losing seasons after the retirement of the iconic Gale Sayers in 1972 .
Payton 's first game was not particularly successful ; he was held to zero net rushing yards on eight attempts .
His best performance of the season was the final game against the New Orleans Saints , where he rushed for 134 yards on 20 carries .
Payton finished the season with only 679 yards and seven touchdowns .
However , Payton led the league in yards per kickoff return .
Payton was eager to improve his performance .
During the 1976 NFL season , Payton rushed for 1,390 yards and scored 13 touchdowns .
After the season , he was selected to play in the 1977 Pro Bowl , where he was declared the Pro Bowl MVP .
The next year , he rushed for 1,852 yards and scored 16 touchdowns , becoming the league 's leading scorer for the season .
He earned numerous awards that season , including the Associated Press and Pro Football Writers of America 's Most Valuable Player awards .
A memorable game of the 1977 NFL season was against the Minnesota Vikings on November 20 .
He rushed for a then - record 275 yards , breaking the previous record of 273 yards held by O. J. Simpson .
In that record - setting game against the Vikings , Payton was suffering with a 101-degree fever and intense flu .
His longest run was for 58 yards , and he caught one pass for 6 yards .
His record stood for 23 years until Corey Dillon of the Cincinnati Bengals ran for 278 yards on October 22 , 2000 .
( Adrian Peterson of the Minnesota Vikings set the current record of 296 rushing yards in 2007 . )
By the end of the decade , Payton had received additional accolades for his exploits as a blocker , receiver , emergency punter , and quarterback .
1983–1986
Section::::1983–1986 .
The Bears struggled to assemble consecutive winning seasons , landing only two playoff berths since his arrival .
The lack of success prompted the Bears ' management to replace Neill Armstrong with Mike Ditka for the season that began in the Fall of 1982 .
Ditka , a tight end during the 1960s and 1970s who would also join the Pro Football Hall of Fame , led the Bears to a 3–6 ( strike - shortened ) record in 1982 .
He led the Bears to an 8–8 finish in 1983 and to a 10–6 finish in 1984 .
Payton continued his success by rushing for more than 1,400 yards in both seasons .
On September 19 , 1984 , Payton passed Franco Harris as the active leader in career rushing yards .
Three weeks later , on October 7 , 1984 against the New Orleans Saints , Payton broke Jim Brown 's career rushing record of 12,312 yards .
In 1985 , Payton rushed for more than 1,500 yards , helping the Bears establish the league 's second - best offense with the emergence of quarterback Jim McMahon .
The Bears ' 46 defense of that season would go on to become one of the best in NFL history , setting a record for fewest points allowed .
In one 1984 game , Payton was pressed into service as the team 's fourth - string quarterback .
Payton performed with his teammates in the widely released 1985 music video The Super Bowl Shuffle .
The Bears went on to a 15–1 record that culminated in a 46–10 victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XX .
Although Payton 's offensive prowess had assisted the Bears throughout the 1985 season , he did not score any touchdowns in the postseason and the New England Patriots prevented him from reaching the end zone in the Super Bowl .
According to quarterback Jim McMahon , he was targeted by two or three defenders on every play , and others stated that Payton 's mere presence allowed others to shine , given that at least 2 people were targeting Payton on every play .
In a later interview , Ditka stated that one of his major regrets was Payton 's lack of a touchdown in the Super Bowl .
1986–1987
Section::::1986–1987 .
Payton , who was a 12-year veteran , amassed 1,333 yards in the 1986 NFL season .
The Bears won the NFC Central Division , but lost to the Washington Redskins 27–13 in the divisional round .
At the end of the 1986 season , he announced that he would retire from professional football after completing the 1987 NFL season .
During his last season with the Bears , Payton split carries with his successor , Neal Anderson , and rushed for a career - low 533 yards along with four touchdowns .
Payton 's career ended with another loss to the Washington Redskins in the divisional round of the playoffs by the score of 21–17 on January 10 , 1988 .
Over his entire career , Payton rushed for 16,726 yards , which broke the record for most rushing yards by any NFL player in history , and scored 110 touchdowns .
He caught 492 passes for 4,538 yards and 15 touchdowns .
Payton set several team records , including most career rushing yards , receptions , touchdowns , and touchdown passes by a running back .
His jersey number was retired by the Bears , and he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1993 .
The only game he missed in his 13-year career was in his rookie season of 1975 .
PLAYING STYLE
Section::::Playing style .
Payton 's motto was " Never Die Easy " , which is also the title of his posthumously published autobiography .
Payton attributed this motto to Bob Hill , his coach at Jackson State .
In practice , this meant that Payton refused to deliberately run out - of - bounds and always delivered some punishment to his tacklers before being forced off the field or forced down .
One of Payton 's signature maneuvers was the " stutter - step " , a high - stepping , irregularly paced run .
He developed this as a way to distract his pursuers during long runs , saying that it startled them into thinking and gave him some advantage over players who were actually faster runners .
In his autobiography , he likened the stutter step to a kind of " option play " : when he was stutter - stepping , defenders would have to commit to a pursuit angle based upon whether they thought he would accelerate after the stutter - step , or cut — he would read this angle and do the opposite of what the defender had committed to .
He re - invented the practice of stiff - arming his tacklers , which had gone out of favor among running backs in the 1970s .
At times , he used his high school experience as a long jumper to leap over his opponents , landing on his head in the end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills .
His running gait was somewhat unusual , as his knees were minimally bent , and the motion was largely powered from the hip .
This may have given his knees , a football player 's most vulnerable joints , some protection , although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 1983 .
He referred to this procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup .
After scoring touchdowns , Payton declined to celebrate ; instead , he would often hand the ball to his teammates or the official .
He disapproved of the growing practice of touchdown celebrations ; he preferred post - game antics such as rushing into the locker room and locking his teammates out in the cold while taking a long shower .
Although Payton would have won the respect of his peers and coaches by his running alone , he retired as the career leader in receptions for a running back with 492 for over 4,500 yards , and still holds the career record for a running back with 8 touchdown passes .
PERSONAL LIFE Section::::Personal life .
Throughout his life , Payton had claimed his date of birth as July 25 , 1954 , a date which is cited in many of his early biographies .
However , while researching his biography of Payton , Sports Illustrateds Jeff Pearlman discovered his actual date of birth to be July 25 , 1953 .
Pearlman found Payton 's earliest use of the later date during his pursuit of the Heisman Trophy at Jackson State .
Payton married Connie Norwood in 1976 .
During his rookie year , he resided in a home on the north side of Arlington Heights , Illinois .
The couple had two children , Jarrett Payton ( born 1980 ) and Brittney ( born December 26 , 1985 ) and resided in South Barrington , Illinois .
A 2011 biography by Pearlman describes a tumultuous personal life very different from his positive public image .
According to Pearlman 's biography , Payton was a consistent adulterer , and a multiple drug user .
His drug use began with painkillers provided to him by the Bears to cope with the punishment he absorbed during games , and continued after his football career ended .
Payton did not cope well with life after his career , especially with issues of boredom and loneliness .
The book further states that Payton was depressed and suicidal in the mid-1990s .
His wife and family contend that the book is filled with factual misstatements , and paints too bleak a picture of his life .
However , many reviewers of Pearlman 's work have found it to have been " exhaustively " researched and documented by hundreds of interviews .
The ghostwriter for Payton 's autobiography called the book " an incredible , thoughtful , deep and profound read .
It 's exceptional work . "
Payton was inducted as a laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln ( the state 's highest honor ) by the governor of Illinois in 1987 in the area of sports .
INVESTMENTS Section::::Investments .
In 1995 , Payton , along with many other investors , sought to bring an NFL expansion team to St. Louis , Missouri , and Payton expressed his interest in becoming the first minority owner in NFL history .
Although the NFL strongly favored a franchise in St. Louis , their efforts were thwarted because of internal dissension among the investment group members leading the NFL to award franchises to investment groups in Jacksonville , Florida ( Jacksonville Jaguars ) and Charlotte , North Carolina ( Carolina Panthers ) .
St. Louis eventually received a team when the Los Angeles Rams moved to the city in 1995 .
Payton pursued various business ventures in retirement , including becoming co - owner of Dale Coyne Racing in the CART IndyCar World Series .
He also drove in several Trans - Am Series events , including a 1993 race at Road America in which his car overturned and caught fire .
He suffered burns but escaped serious injury .
In 1995 , he and several partners purchased a Chicago , Burlington and Quincy Railroad roundhouse in Aurora , Illinois .
The property became known as " Walter Payton 's Roundhouse " , hosting a restaurant , brewery , banquet and meeting facility , and museum .
In 1999 , the property received an award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation .
The beers brewed at the Roundhouse received awards in the 2000s .
Payton appeared on a 1987 episode of Saturday Night Live ( co - hosting with fellow football player Joe Montana ) .
In 1994 , he made an appearance at the World Wrestling Federation 's Summerslam event in the corner of Razor Ramon .
ILLNESS AND DEATH Section::::Illness and death .
In February 1999 , Payton announced that he had a rare liver disease known as primary sclerosing cholangitis , which may have led to his cholangiocarcinoma ( bile duct cancer ) .
He spent his final months as an advocate for organ transplants , appearing in many commercials to encourage others to donate organs , although by the time his first appeal was recorded , his illness was already too far advanced for transplantation to have been a viable option .
In April of that year , Payton made a final public appearance at a Chicago Cubs game with Mike Ditka , where he threw the game 's ceremonial first pitch .
Author Don Yaeger worked with him during the last weeks of his life to create his autobiography , Never Die Easy .
On November 1 , 1999 , Payton died from the complications that arose from his illness .
During the same week , the NFL held special ceremonies in each game to commemorate his career and legacy .
In addition , the Chicago Bears wore special # 34 patches on their jerseys to honor Payton .
His body was cremated after his death .
Speakers at Payton 's public funeral service , held in Soldier Field , included Jesse Jackson ; then
National Football League Commissioner Paul Tagliabue ; former teammate Dan Hampton ; his widow Connie Payton ; and his children , Jarrett and Brittney .
Among the 1,000 mourners at the private service were John Madden ; Illinois Governor George Ryan ; Chicago 's mayor Richard M. Daley ; former teammates Matt Suhey , Mike Singletary , Roland Harper , and Jim McMahon ; the Bears ' equipment manager and building superintendent ; and many other people representing a wide social , political , and economic spectrum .
LEGACY Section::::Legacy .
Payton 's legacy continues through the charitable Walter and Connie Payton Foundation .
His own appeals — and after his death , his foundation's — for greater awareness of the need for organ donations are widely credited with bringing national attention to the problem .
After his appeals , donations in Illinois skyrocketed , and the regional organ bank of Illinois was overwhelmed with calls .
In response , the City of Chicago inserted organ donation requests into city - vehicle - registration mailings in early 2000 , and by August 2000 , 13,000 people had signed on to the program .
The foundation continues to run a program that Payton organized to donate toys to underprivileged children across the Chicago area each Christmas .
