LIST OF GRAMMAR SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND
This is a list of the current 163 state - funded fully selective schools ( grammar schools ) in England , as enumerated by Statutory Instrument .
The 1998 Statutory Instrument listed 166 such schools .
However , in 2000 Bristol Local Education Authority , following consultation , implemented changes removing selection by 11 + exam from the entry requirements for two of the schools on this original list .
This list does not include former direct grant grammar schools which elected to remain independent , often retaining the title " grammar school " .
For such schools see the list of direct grant grammar schools .
Under the Tripartite System of secondary education in England between the 1940s and 1960s , approximately a quarter of children were selected by the eleven plus exam for entry to grammar schools , either " maintained " grammar schools fully funded by the state or direct grant grammar schools .
Most of the maintained grammar schools were closed or converted to comprehensive schools in the 1960s and 1970s , though a few local authorities resisted this move and retained a selective system .
There are also a number of isolated grammar schools , which admit the candidates who score highest on their entry tests .
The remaining 163 English state grammar schools are listed here grouped by region ( from north to south ) and Local Education Authority .
There are no remaining state grammar schools in North East England .
The gender indicated is that of the main school ( ages 11â€“16 ) .
Several single - sex schools have sixth forms that also admit a small number of students of the opposite gender .
