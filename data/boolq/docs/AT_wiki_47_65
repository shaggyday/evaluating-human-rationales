LIST OF SESAME STREET MUPPETS
The Muppets are a group of puppet characters created by Jim Henson , many for the purpose of appearing on the children 's television program Sesame Street .
Henson 's involvement in Sesame Street began when he and Joan Ganz Cooney , one of the creators of the show , met in the summer of 1968 , at one of the show 's five three - day curriculum planning seminars in Boston .
Author Christopher Finch reported that director Jon Stone , who had worked with Henson previously , felt that if they could not bring him on board , they should " make do without puppets " .
Henson was initially reluctant but agreed to join Sesame Street in support of its social goals .
He also agreed to waive his performance fee for full ownership of the Sesame Street Muppets and to split any revenue they generated with the Children 's Television Workshop ( renamed to the Sesame Workshop in 2000 ) , the series ' non - profit producer .
The Muppets were a crucial part of the show 's popularity and it brought Henson national attention .
The Muppet segments of the show were popular since its premiere , and more Muppets were added during the first few seasons .
The Muppets were effective teaching tools because children easily recognized them , they were predictable , and they appealed to adults and older siblings .
During the production of Sesame Streets first season , producers created five one - hour episodes to test the show 's appeal to children and examine their comprehension of the material .
Not intended for broadcast , they were presented to preschoolers in 60 homes throughout Philadelphia and in day care centers in New York City in July 1969 .
The results were " generally very positive " ; children learned from the shows , their appeal was high , and children 's attention was sustained over the full hour .
However , the researchers found that although children 's attention was high during the Muppet segments , their interest wavered during the " Street " segments , when no Muppets were on screen .
This was because the producers had followed the advice of child psychologists who were concerned that children would be confused if human actors and Muppets were shown together .
As a result of this decision , the appeal of the test episodes was lower than the target .
The Street scenes were " the glue " that " pulled the show together " , so producers knew they needed to make significant changes .
The producers decided to reject the advisers ' advice and reshot the Street segments ; Henson and his coworkers created Muppets that could interact with the human actors , specifically Oscar the Grouch and Big Bird , who became two of the show 's most enduring characters .
These test episodes were directly responsible for what writer Malcolm Gladwell called " the essence of Sesame Street — the artful blend of fluffy monsters and earnest adults " .
Since 2001 , the full rights for the Muppets created for Sesame Street have been owned by Sesame Workshop .
