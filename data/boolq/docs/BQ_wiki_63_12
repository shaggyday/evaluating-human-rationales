NIGERIA NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM
The Nigeria national football team , also known as the Super Eagles , represents Nigeria in international association football and is controlled by the Nigeria Football Federation ( NFF ) .
They are three - time Africa Cup of Nations winners , with their last title in 2013 , after defeating Burkina Faso in the final .
In April 1994 , the Super Eagles was ranked 5th in the FIFA rankings , the highest FIFA ranking position ever achieved by an African football team .
Throughout history , the team has qualified for six of the last seven FIFA World Cups ( as of 2018 ) , missing only the 2006 World Cup hosted in Germany , and have reached the round of 16 three times .
Their first World Cup appearance was the 1994 edition hosted by the United States .
HISTORY Section::::History .
After playing other colonies in unofficial games since the 1930s , Nigeria played its first official game in October 1949 , while still a British colony .
The team played warm - up games in England against various amateur teams including Bromley , Dulwich Hamlet , Bishop Auckland and South Liverpool .
The team 's first major success was a gold medal in the 2nd All - Africa games , with 3rd - place finishes in the 1976 and 1978 African Cup of Nations to follow .
In 1980 , with players such as Segun Odegbami and Best Ogedegbe , the team , led by Christian Chukwu , won the Cup for the first time in Lagos .
Nigeria Olympic men 's football team won the football event at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta , beating Mexico , Brazil and Argentina in the process .
They were runners - up in the same event at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing , losing to Argentina in a rematch of the 1996 event .
In 1984 and 1988 , Nigeria reached the Cup of Nations final , losing both times to Cameroon .
Three of the five African titles won by Cameroon have been won by defeating Nigeria .
Missing out to Cameroon on many occasions has created an intense rivalry between both nations .
Three notable occasions ; narrowly losing out in the 1988 African Cup of Nations , qualifiers for the 1990 World Cup , and then the controversial final of the 2000 African Cup of Nations where a kick taken by Victor Ikpeba during the penalty shoot - out was adjudged not to have crossed the goal - line by the referee .
TEAM IMAGE KITS AND CREST Section::::Team image .
Section::::Kits and crest .
The Nigeria national team has traditionally utilized a mostly - solid green on green primary set with white numbering , lettering , and highlights ; coupled with all - white reversed secondary kits , all emblematic of the colors of the Nigerian flag .
The shade of green has varied over the years .
An olive drab - tinged , forest green was frequently favored during the 1980s to the early 1990s , and jade has appeared in each of those decades as well ; even harlequin has been utilized .
Over the last decade , the team has appeared to settle on the more standard office green which most closely resembles the shade used on the flag .
Nigeria 's first national teams used a solid scarlet top over white shorts and socks until the country adopted its current colors after its independence .
On 23 April 2015 , Nike was announced to be the current supplier of Nigeria 's kits after Adidas ended their kit contract with the Nigeria Football Federation .
Before that , Nike supplied Nigeria 's kit between 1998 and 2003 .

Notes NICKNAME Section::::Nickname .
Nigeria 's national team image has undergone much evolution throughout its history .
Prior to independence , they were called the Red Devils due to their red topped kits .
The name was changed to the Green Eagles after independence in reference to the Nigerian state flag as well as the eagle which adorns the country 's coat of arms .
During the 1988 Africa Cup of Nations , they were still called the Green Eagles , but following their controversial loss in the final , the team 's name was changed to the " Super Eagles " .
Today , only the senior men 's national team uses the nickname .
The women 's national team is called the " Super Falcons " , and Nigeria 's underage male teams are nicknamed the " Flying Eagles " & the " Golden Eaglets " .
RIVALRIES
GHANA Section::::Rivalries .
Section::::Ghana .
Many important matches have been played against various nations who have been occasional rivals .
Of these nations , Ghana is widely considered Nigeria 's primary rival as the two sides have met one another more than any other opponent .
The record is dominated by Ghana although Nigeria has enjoyed periods of success .
The most notable of these periods are the early contests during the 1950s , and matches that took place in the early 2000s .
FIFA lists the first official match between the two as a World Cup qualifier match in 1960 .
However both national teams had already engaged in competitive matches dating back to 1950 .
The national teams of these two West African countries were formed during the time in which both remained protectorates of the British Empire .
At that time the modern - day nation of Ghana was known as the Gold Coast .
Nigeria , prior to adopting the national colors of green and white , wore scarlet tops over white shorts and were known as the " Red Devils " .
The two sides played for several rivalry and tournament cups during this period in which full international competition was barred to them .
OTHER AFRICAN NATIONS Section::::Other African nations .
Nigeria 's neighbors to the east , Cameroon , have also played Nigeria a number of times over the years .
The teams have met three times in the African Cup of Nations Final with Cameroon winning each time .
Both carry histories of continental success and World Cup representation that is nearly unrivaled on the African continent .
There is also a number of competitive matches with Algeria dating back to the 1970s .
The two sides met twice in the African Cup of Nations finals , with each nation splitting the win totals .
It was a 1–1 draw in Algeria on 8 October 1993 that enabled Nigeria to claim its first World Cup berth in the 1994 edition of the tournament .
Nigeria 's western neighbor , Benin , has played competitive matches with the team since the period of European colonization when they were known as Dahomey .
But with only two wins and two draws to Benin 's credit against Nigeria 's fourteen wins , and with the sides having only met six times since 1980 , Benin remains a lightly regarded opponent .
ARGENTINA Section::::Argentina .
In five of its first six World Cup appearances , Nigeria was drawn in the group stage with two - time champion Argentina and is regarded by many fans as having acquitted themselves fairly against the footballing giant .
The fixture is the most common in the competition 's history involving an African nation .
All five matches have been won by Argentina , but all were by a one - goal margin ( 2–1 in 1994 , 1–0 in 2002 , 1–0 in 2010 , 3–2 in 2014 and 2–1 in 2018 ) and have been tightly contested .
To date Nigeria has recorded two wins against Argentina 's six , with the victories occurring during friendly matches .
Nigeria came close to defeating Argentina in their first meeting , during which they held a lead for some minutes of the match .
This was followed by a Confederations Cup match in 1995 which saw Nigeria hold the South Americans to a 0–0 draw .
Below full international level , their Olympic teams also faced off in the gold medal match in 1996 ( 3–2 to Nigeria ) , and 2008 ( 1–0 to Argentina ) .
The final of the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship was also played between them ; both Argentina goals in their 2–1 win were scored by Lionel Messi , who would go on to find the net for the senior team in the 2014 and 2018 World Cup fixtures .
The match - up holds some importance to many Nigerian football fans who regard the challenge as an important measuring stick for the development of Nigerian football .
However it means less to Argentinean fans , having taken less interest with each passing cycle that Nigeria failed to engineer a meaningful competitive victory .
MEDIA COVERAGE Section::::Media coverage .
The Nigerian football federation currently has an active deal with the parent company of AIT and Ray Power Radio .
Internationally , Nigeria 's qualifiers and African Cup matches are regularly broadcast abroad by the multi - platform international sports network , beIN
Sports and South African broadcaster SuperSport .
Nigeria 's international friendlies are regularly scheduled in the UK through independent organizers and are marketed to the country 's large population of Nigerian expatriates .
SUPPORTERS Section::::Supporters .
The Nigerian Football Supporters Club ( NFSC ) is the primary supporters club for the Nigerian football team .
Though the club is most notable at Nigeria 's home matches wearing green - themed embroidered outfits specific to the club along with wigs , hats and large sunglasses while dancing , singing , playing drums and trumpets , as well as carrying pom poms , culturally significant objects , inflatable beachballs , and waving flags ; they have also shown a presence traveling abroad to support Nigeria in away matches .
However , the club 's efforts at improving the atmosphere at Nigeria 's home and away matches are beset by funding issues , corruption and infighting .
The club 's current head , Dr. Rafiu Ladipo , has drawn criticism from its membership and is under pressure to defer the leadership to one of his deputies .
A regular sight at Nigerian home matches is also their brass and percussion band , whose rendition of well - known Highlife songs provides Nigerian home matches with a unique feel .
In Nigeria , these performers are occasionally conspicuous with their military uniforms or they may be members of the Football Supporters Club .
A popular chant among supporters from all over the country , after a goal scored , is " Oshe Baba ! " , which means " Thank you father ! "
in Yoruba .
HOME STADIUM Section::::Home stadium .
The Abuja National Stadium ( also known as National Stadium or Abuja Stadium ) serves as the official home stadium of the Super Eagles .
Several international matches are played in other stadiums across the country .
However , since the construction of Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo , Akwa Ibom State , most of the Super Eagles ' important home matches have been played there .

1998
WORLD CUP Section::::1998
World Cup .
In 1998 , Nigeria returned to the World Cup alongside Cameroon , Morocco , Tunisia , and South Africa .
Optimism was high due to its manager Bora Milutinović and the return of most 1994 squad members .
In the final tournament Nigeria were drawn into group D with Spain , Bulgaria , Paraguay .
Nigeria scored a major upset by defeating Spain 3–2 after coming back twice from being 1–0 and 2–1 down .
The Eagles qualified for the second round with a win against Bulgaria and a loss to Paraguay .
The team 's hopes of surpassing its 1994 performance was shattered after a 1–4 loss to Denmark .
2002 AND 2006
WORLD CUPS Section::::2002 and 2006 World Cups .
The 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan saw Nigeria again qualify with optimism .
With a new squad and distinctive pastel green kits , the Super Eagles were expected to build on its strong performances in the 2000 and 2002 African Cup of Nations .
Nigeria were drawn into group F with powerhouses Sweden , Argentina , and England .
The first game against Argentina started with a strong defence that kept the first half scoreless .
In the 61st minute , Gabriel Batistuta breached the Nigerian defence to put Argentina in the lead 1–0 , and Argentina would go on to win the game .
Nigeria 's second game against Sweden saw them take the lead but later lose 2–1 .
Nigeria then drew 0–0 with England and bowed out in the first round .
Nigeria failed to qualify for the 2006 World Cup after finishing level on points in the qualification group with Angola , but having an inferior record in the matches between the sides .
2010
WORLD CUP Section::::2010
World Cup .
On 14 November 2009 , Nigeria qualified for the 2010 World Cup after defeating Kenya by 3–2 in Nairobi .
Nigeria lost its opening match against Argentina 1–0 at Ellis Park Stadium following a controversial Gabriel Heinze header in the 6th minute .
In its second game Nigeria led early on by a goal from Kalu Uche .
A red card against Sani Kaita gave Greece the advantage .
Greece scored the equaliser late in the first half and Nigeria conceded the second goal in the second half and lost the game 2–1 .
In their last group stage match against South Korea , Nigeria took an early lead in the 12th minute off of a great finish by Kalu Uche after a low cross from Chidi Odiah .
However , goals from Lee Jung - Soo and Park Chu - Young gave South Korea a 2–1 lead , which looked to be enough for South Korea to advance into the round of 16 .
However , Nigeria got a chance in the 66th minute that the Super Eagles will probably never forget .
On the end of a pass from Ayila Yussuf that was fed through the South Korean defense was none other than Yakubu , Once the pass found Yakubu 's foot about four yards away from the empty goal , Yakubu pushed the ball wide of the left post to keep South Korea ahead 2–1 .
Three minutes later , Yakubu was able to calmly finish a penalty to knot the score at two apiece , but the damage was done as Nigeria was unable to score again and the match ended in a 2–2 draw .
With this result , Nigeria was eliminated from the 2010 World Cup with just one point , while South Korea advanced into the round of 16 with four points .
On 30 June 2010 , following the team 's early exit and poor showing , the then President of Nigeria , Goodluck Jonathan suspended the national football team from international competition for two years .
This suspension put the team at risk of being banned from international football by FIFA for reasons of political interference .
On 5 July 2010 , the Nigerian government rescinded its ban of the national football team from FIFA / CAF football competitions , but the sanction of suspension was applied by FIFA some three months after .
On 4 October 2010 , Nigeria was indefinitely banned from international football due to government interference following the 2010 World Cup .
Four days later , however , the ban was " provisionally lifted " until 26 October , the day after the officially unrecognised National Association of Nigerian Footballers ( NANF ) dropped its court case against the NFF .
2014
WORLD CUP Section::::2014 World Cup .
Nigeria 's campaign in the 2014 FIFA World Cup opened with a disappointing 0–0 draw against Iran .
Four days later the team played their second game against Bosnia and Herzegovina .
A controversial 29th - minute Peter Odemwingie goal gave Nigeria their first World Cup win since 1998 .
They faced Argentina another four days later : a 3rd minute Lionel Messi goal for the opposition was followed almost instantly with an equalizer by Ahmed Musa .
Messi gave Argentina the lead back just before half - time .
In the second half Musa leveled the game out again , Lionel Messi was substituted and handed over his captaincy to Marcos Rojo only for Rojo to put Argentina 3–2 ahead minutes later .
Nigeria lost the match , but still qualified for the round of 16 .
In the Round of 16 Nigeria faced France , an 18th - minute stabbed shot from Emmanuel Emenike saw the ball in the net , past the French goal - keeper but the goal was ruled off - side by the linesman .
Nigeria held them off until the 79th minute when a cross and a Paul Pogba header gifted France the lead .
An accidental own goal by Super Eagles Captain Joseph Yobo in injury time put the result beyond any doubt : Nigeria was out .
This is the third time Nigeria is eliminated in the round of 16 and they were not still able to enter the Quarter - finals in the FIFA World Cup .
