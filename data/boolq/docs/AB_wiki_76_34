GEOMETRIC SERIES
In mathematics , a geometric series is a series with a constant ratio between successive terms .
For example , the series is geometric , because each successive term can be obtained by multiplying the previous term by 1/2 .
Geometric series are among the simplest examples of infinite series with finite sums , although not all of them have this property .
Historically , geometric series played an important role in the early development of calculus , and they continue to be central in the study of convergence of series .
Geometric series are used throughout mathematics , and they have important applications in physics , engineering , biology , economics , computer science , queueing theory , and finance .
COMMON RATIO
Section::::Common ratio .
The terms of a geometric series form a geometric progression , meaning that the ratio of successive terms in the series is constant .
This relationship allows for the representation of a geometric series using only two terms , r and a.
The term r is the common ratio , and a is the first term of the series .
As an example the geometric series given in the introduction , may simply be written as The following table shows several geometric series with different start terms and common ratios : !

The behavior of the terms depends on the common ratio r : SUM Section::::Sum .
The sum of a geometric series is finite as long as the absolute value of the ratio is less than 1 ; as the numbers near zero , they become insignificantly small , allowing a sum to be calculated despite the series containing infinitely many terms .
The sum can be computed using the self - similarity of the series .
EXAMPLE Section::::Example .
Consider the sum of the following geometric series :
This series has common ratio 2/3 .
If we multiply through by this common ratio , then the initial 1 becomes a 2/3 , the 2/3 becomes a 4/9 , and so on : This new series is the same as the original , except that the first term is missing .
Subtracting the new series ( 2/3)s from the original series s cancels every term in the original but the first , A similar technique can be used to evaluate any self - similar expression .
FORMULA Section::::Formula .
For formula_9 , the sum of the first n terms of a geometric series is where is the first term of the series , and is the common ratio .
We can derive this formula as follows : so , As goes to infinity , the absolute value of must be less than one for the series to converge .
The sum then becomes When , this can be simplified to the left - hand side being a geometric series with common ratio .
The formula also holds for complex , with the corresponding restriction , the modulus of is strictly less than one .
PROOF OF CONVERGENCE Section::::Proof of convergence .
We can prove that the geometric series converges using the sum formula for a geometric progression : Since ( 1 + r + r
+ ...
+ r)(1−r ) =
1−r and for r < 1 .
Convergence of geometric series can also be demonstrated by rewriting the series as an equivalent telescoping series .
Consider the function , Note that Thus , If then So S converges to APPLICATIONS
REPEATING DECIMALS
Section::::Applications .
Section::::Repeating decimals .
A repeating decimal can be thought of as a geometric series whose common ratio is a power of 1/10 .
For example : The formula for the sum of a geometric series can be used to convert the decimal to a fraction ,
The formula works not only for a single repeating figure , but also for a repeating group of figures .
For example : Note that every series of repeating consecutive decimals can be conveniently simplified with the following :
That is , a repeating decimal with repeat length is equal to the quotient of the repeating part ( as an integer ) and .
ARCHIMEDES ' QUADRATURE OF THE PARABOLA
Section::::Archimedes ' quadrature of the parabola .
Archimedes used the sum of a geometric series to compute the area enclosed by a parabola and a straight line .
His method was to dissect the area into an infinite number of triangles .
Archimedes ' Theorem states that the total area under the parabola is 4/3 of the area of the blue triangle .
Archimedes determined that each green triangle has 1/8 the area of the blue triangle , each yellow triangle has 1/8 the area of a green triangle , and so forth .
Assuming that the blue triangle has area 1 , the total area is an infinite sum :
The first term represents the area of the blue triangle , the second term the areas of the two green triangles , the third term the areas of the four yellow triangles , and so on .
Simplifying the fractions gives
This is a geometric series with common ratio and the fractional part is equal to
The sum is This computation uses the method of exhaustion , an early version of integration .
Using calculus , the same area could be found by a definite integral .
FRACTAL GEOMETRY
Section::::Fractal geometry .
In the study of fractals , geometric series often arise as the perimeter , area , or volume of a self - similar figure .
For example , the area inside the Koch snowflake can be described as the union of infinitely many equilateral triangles ( see figure ) .
Each side of the green triangle is exactly 1/3 the size of a side of the large blue triangle , and therefore has exactly 1/9 the area .
Similarly , each yellow triangle has 1/9 the area of a green triangle , and so forth .
Taking the blue triangle as a unit of area , the total area of the snowflake is The first term of this series represents the area of the blue triangle , the second term the total area of the three green triangles , the third term the total area of the twelve yellow triangles , and so forth .
Excluding the initial 1 , this series is geometric with constant ratio r = 4/9 .
The first term of the geometric series is a = 3(1/9 ) = 1/3 , so the sum is
Thus the Koch snowflake has 8/5 of the area of the base triangle .
ZENO 'S
PARADOXES Section::::Zeno 's paradoxes .
The convergence of a geometric series reveals that a sum involving an infinite number of summands can indeed be finite , and so allows one to resolve many of Zeno 's paradoxes .
For example , Zeno 's dichotomy paradox maintains that movement is impossible , as one can divide any finite path into an infinite number of steps wherein each step is taken to be half the remaining distance .
Zeno 's mistake is in the assumption that the sum of an infinite number of finite steps can not be finite .
This is of course not true , as evidenced by the convergence of the geometric series with formula_34 .
EUCLID Section::::Euclid .
Book IX , Proposition 35 of Euclid 's Elements expresses the partial sum of a geometric series in terms of members of the series .
It is equivalent to the modern formula .
ECONOMICS Section::::Economics .
In economics , geometric series are used to represent the present value of an annuity ( a sum of money to be paid in regular intervals ) .
For example , suppose that a payment of $ 100 will be made to the owner of the annuity once per year ( at the end of the year ) in perpetuity .
Receiving $ 100 a year from now is worth less than an immediate $ 100 , because one can not invest the money until one receives it .
In particular , the present value of $ 100 one year in the future is $ 100 / ( 1 + formula_35 ) , where formula_35 is the yearly interest rate .
Similarly , a payment of $ 100 two years in the future has a present value of $ 100 / ( 1 + formula_35 ) ( squared because two years ' worth of interest is lost by not receiving the money right now ) .
Therefore , the present value of receiving $ 100 per year in perpetuity is which is the infinite series :
This is a geometric series with common ratio 1 / ( 1 + formula_35 ) .
The sum is the first term divided by ( one minus the common ratio ) :
For example , if the yearly interest rate is 10 % ( formula_35 = 0.10 ) , then the entire annuity has a present value of $ 100 / 0.10 = $ 1000 .
This sort of calculation is used to compute the APR of a loan ( such as a mortgage loan ) .
It can also be used to estimate the present value of expected stock dividends , or the terminal value of a security .
GEOMETRIC POWER SERIES Section::::Geometric power series .
The formula for a geometric series can be interpreted as a power series in the Taylor 's theorem sense , converging
where formula_44 .
From this , one can extrapolate to obtain other power series .
For example , By differentiating the geometric series , one obtains the variant Similarly obtained are :
