PLOT Section::::Plot .
In the summer of 1958 , greaser Danny Zuko and sweet Australian girl Sandy Olsson meet at the beach and fall in love .
When the summer comes to an end , Sandy , whose family is returning to Australia , worries that they might never meet again , but Danny tells her that their love is " only the beginning . "
At the beginning of the new school year at Rydell High School ( " Grease " ) , Danny reunites with his fellow gang members , the T - Birds , of whom his best friend Kenickie , along with Doody , Sonny , and Putzie are members .
Meanwhile , unbeknownst to Danny , Sandy arrives at school , with her family 's plans having changed , with her new friend Frenchy , a member of the Pink Ladies .
Other Pink Ladies Rizzo , Marty , and Jan also arrive , excited to be seniors , as does Patty Simcox , a high - achieving cheerleader .
At lunch , Frenchy introduces Sandy to the other Pink Ladies while Danny and the T - Birds make fun of practicing football players , including the handsome Tom Chisum .
Each group asks Danny and Sandy , respectively , about their summers and they each independently describe their romance without using the other 's name , with Sandy 's description far more innocent than Danny 's ( " Summer Nights " ) .
Headed back to class , Sandy reveals that it was Danny Zuko she met , and Rizzo teases that perhaps she 'll meet him again .
At a pep rally before a football game , Sandy and Patty
perform as cheerleaders ; there , Sandy and Tom flirt .
Kenickie arrives with a used car he plans on rebuilding so he can race it at Thunder Road , a popular street race spot ; as he says this , Leo Balmudo , a rival greaser from the Scorpions , drives by in a menacing manner .
Rizzo puts Sandy and Danny together , surprising both of them .
Sandy is thrilled to see Danny , but he is obnoxious and indifferent , upsetting Sandy .
Frenchy invites Sandy to a sleepover with the Pink Ladies to cheer her up .
Rizzo and the other girls pressure Sandy into smoking a cigarette and having a drink of wine at the sleepover .
Frenchy reveals that she plans to drop out of Rydell to go to beauty school and in an effort to prove herself , tries to pierce Sandy 's ear , making Sandy sick .
Rizzo makes fun of her innocent nature ( " Look At Me , I 'm Sandra Dee " ) and leaves when the T - Birds arrive in Kenickie 's car .
Rizzo tries to make Danny jealous by flirting with Kenickie , but Danny is unmoved and leaves .
Kenickie leaves with Rizzo , stranding Putzie , Sonny , and Doody .
Sandy laments over her feelings towards Danny , despite his earlier behavior ( " Hopelessly Devoted to You " ) .
Kenickie and Rizzo , while in the midst of sex , are interrupted when Leo , along with his girlfriend Cha - Cha , deliberately crashes his own street racer into Kenickie 's and insults Rizzo .
At the same time , Kenickie 's condom breaks .
The next day , the T - Birds look over Kenickie 's car , and although they are initially skeptical of its potential , Danny and Kenickie explain the modifications they could add to make it a hot - rodding sex machine ( " Greased Lightnin ' " ) .
At the popular hangout The Frosty Palace , Danny , after brushing off an attempt by Patty to flirt with him , apologizes to Sandy for his behavior at the pep rally , but she rejects him having started dating Tom instead .

After everyone else has left , Frenchy , whose hair has turned bright pink , tells a waitress she has dropped out of beauty school and is visited by a guardian angel who advises her to return to Rydell ( " Beauty School Dropout " ) .
At the school dance , Leo and Cha - Cha show up as Rizzo 's and Kenickie 's respective dates .
Vince Fontaine , who is hosting a live telecast of the dance , flirts with Marty .

Danny and Sandy do well , but Sonny pulls Sandy off the dance floor , allowing Cha Cha to step in and win with Danny .
During the last dance ( " Blue Moon " ) , Sonny , Putzie , and Doody moon the national TV audience .
Danny apologizes to Sandy and tries to make it up to her by taking her to a drive - in movie theater .
She 's unmoved by his pleas for forgiveness until he asks her to wear his ring , which she gleefully accepts .
Danny then tries to make out with her , causing Sandy to angrily throw his ring at him and run off in disgust , leaving Danny distraught ( " Sandy " ) .
Meanwhile , Rizzo admits she may be pregnant to Marty and asks her to keep it a secret , but the story gets back to Kenickie , and he tells Rizzo he does n't run away from his mistakes .
Rizzo tells Kenickie the baby is n't his , which both relieves and upsets him .
The next day , the T - Birds have finished Kenickie 's car and he is eager to race it against Leo 's at Thunder Road .
Sandy tells Rizzo she plans to watch the race and offers to help Rizzo despite the rumors about Rizzo 's character that have been spread around school .
She thanks Sandy and muses to herself about how her sins are not as bad as they could be ( " There Are Worse Things I Could Do " ) .
The T - Birds , Pink Ladies , and Scorpions gather for the race , with the winner receiving the loser 's car as a prize .
Just before the race begins , Kenickie hits his head , and Danny takes the wheel .
Despite Leo using bladed hub caps ( in a sequence paying homage to Ben - Hur ) , Danny wins the race .
Sandy watches from afar and concludes that she must change her approach to life if she wants to win over Danny , asking Frenchy for help ( " Look At Me
, I 'm Sandra Dee ( Reprise ) " ) .
The gang celebrates graduation at a school carnival where Rizzo tells Kenickie she is n't pregnant
and they reunite .

Section::::Casting .
John Travolta had previously worked with producer Robert Stigwood on Saturday Night Fever , had a nascent singing career at the time ( including the top-10 hit " Let Her In " in 1976 ) , and had previously appeared as Doody in a touring production of the stage version of Grease .
He made a number of casting recommendations that Stigwood ultimately accepted , including suggesting Randal Kleiser ( who had never directed a theatrical feature before this but had directed Travolta in the 1976 telefilm The Boy in the Plastic Bubble ) as director , and Olivia Newton - John , then known almost exclusively as a country music singer , as Sandy .
Newton - John had done little acting before this film , with only one film credit ( the unreleased 1970 film Toomorrow , which predated her singing breakthrough ) to her name up to that time .
Before accepting the role , Newton - John requested a screen test for Grease to avoid another career setback .
The screen test was done with the drive - in movie scene .
Newton - John , who is native to England and lived most of her life in Australia , was unable to perform with a convincing American accent , and thus her character was rewritten to be Australian .
Before Newton - John was hired , Allan Carr was considering numerous names such as Ann - Margret , Susan Dey and Marie Osmond for the lead role ; Newton - John agreed to a reduced asking price in exchange for star billing .
In a case of life imitating art , Newton - John 's own musical career would undergo a transformation similar to that of the Sandy Olsson character ; her next album after Grease , the provocatively titled Totally Hot , featured a much more sexual and pop - oriented approach , with Newton - John appearing on the album cover in similar all - leather attire and teased hair .
Jeff Conaway , like Travolta , had previously appeared in the stage version of Grease ; he had played Danny Zuko during the show 's run on Broadway .
Jamie Donnelly reprised her role as Jan from the Broadway show , the only cast member to do so ; as her hair had begun to gray by this point , she had to dye her hair to resemble her stage character .
Kelly Ward had previously appeared as a similar sarcastic supporting character in The Boy in the Plastic Bubble with Travolta under Kleiser ; he was cast as Putzie , a mostly new character .
Lorenzo Lamas was a last - minute replacement for Steven Ford , who developed stage fright shortly before filming and backed out .
His role contained no spoken dialogue and required Lamas to dye his hair blond to avoid looking like most of the other T - Birds ( although Conaway and Ward were also blonds ) .
Henry Winkler was once considered for a lead in the film .
Winkler , who was playing Arthur Fonzarelli on Happy Days , was originally chosen to play Danny .
His lack of singing experience and fear of being typecast after Happy Days and the film The Lords of Flatbush led him to decline the role .
Adult film star Harry Reems was originally signed to play Coach Calhoun ; however , executives at Paramount nixed the idea due to Reems ' previous work in adult films , and producers cast Sid Caesar instead .
Caesar was one of several veterans of 1950s television ( Eve Arden , Frankie Avalon , Joan Blondell , Edd Byrnes , Alice Ghostley , Dody Goodman ) to be cast in supporting roles .
Coincidentally , Frankie Avalon and Randal Kleiser had both appeared in 1966 's Fireball 500 , the latter as an extra .
FILMING LOCATIONS
Section::::Filming locations .
The opening beach scene was shot at Malibu 's Leo Carrillo State Beach , making explicit reference to From Here to Eternity .
The exterior Rydell scenes , including the basketball , baseball and track segments , were shot at Venice High School in Venice , California , while the Rydell interiors , including the high school dance , were filmed at Huntington Park High School .
The sleepover was shot at a private house in East Hollywood .
The Paramount Pictures studio lot was the location of the scenes that involve Frosty Palace and the musical numbers " Greased Lightning " and " Beauty School Dropout " .
The drive - in movie scenes were shot at the Burbank Pickwick Drive -
In ( it was closed and torn down in 1989 and a shopping center took its place ) .
The race was filmed at the Los Angeles River , between the First and Seventh Street Bridges , where many other films have been shot .
The final scene where the carnival took place used John Marshall High School .
Furthermore , owing to budget cuts , a short scene was filmed at Hazard Park in Los Angeles .
POST - PRODUCTION Section::::Post - production .
Scenes inside the Frosty Palace contain obvious blurring of various Coca - Cola signs .
Prior to the film 's release , producer Allan Carr had made a product - placement deal with Coca - Cola 's main competitor Pepsi ( for example , a Pepsi logo can be seen in the animated opening sequence ) .
When Carr saw the footage of the scene with Coca - Cola products and signage , he ordered director Randal Kleiser to either reshoot the scene with Pepsi products or remove the Coca - Cola logos from the scene .
As reshoots were deemed too expensive and time - consuming , optical mattes were used to cover up or blur out the Coca - Cola references .
The ' blurring ' covered up trademarked menu signage and a large wall poster , but a red cooler with the logo could not be sufficiently altered so was left unchanged .
According to Kleiser , " We just had to hope that Pepsi would n't complain .
They did n't .
"
Due to an editing error , a closing scene in which Danny and Sandy kiss was removed from the finished print and lost before its theatrical release .
The scene was preserved only in black - and - white ; Kleiser attempted to have the existing footage colorized and restored to the film for the film 's re - release in 1998 but was dissatisfied with the results .
The scene is included as an extra on the 40th anniversary home video release , and Kleiser hopes to make another attempt at colorizing the footage that is effective enough for the footage to be inserted into the film as he originally intended by the time the film 's 50th anniversary comes in 2028 .

CRITICAL RECEPTION Section::::Critical reception .
Grease received mostly positive reviews from movie critics and is considered by many as one of the best films of 1978 .
Vincent Canby on its initial release in June 1978 called the film " terrific fun " , describing it as a " contemporary fantasy about a 1950s teen - age musical ‚Äî a larger , funnier , wittier and more imaginative - than - Hollywood movie with a life that is all its own " ; Canby pointed out that the film was " somewhat in the manner of Close Encounters of the Third Kind , which recalls the science - fiction films of the ' 50s in a manner more elegant and more benign than anything that was ever made then , Grease is a multimillion - dollar evocation of the B - picture quickies that Sam Katzman used to turn out in the ' 50s
( Do n't Knock the Rock , 1956 ) and that American International carried to the sea in the 1960s ( Beach Party , 1963 ) .
"
Gene Siskel gave the film three stars out of four , calling it " exciting only when John Travolta is on the screen " but still recommending it to viewers , adding , " Four of its musical numbers are genuine showstoppers that should bring applause .
" Variety praised the " zesty coreography and very excellent new plus revived music , " and though Travolta and Newton - John " play together quite well . "
Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times was negative , writing , " I did n't see ' Grease ' onstage , but on the testimony of this strident , cluttered , uninvolving and unattractive movie , it is the ' 50s ‚Äî maybe the last innocent decade allowed to us ‚Äî played back through a grotesquely distorting ' 70s consciousness . "
Gary Arnold of The Washington Post also panned the film , writing , "
Despite the obvious attempts to recall bits from Stanley Donen musicals or Elvis Presley musicals or Frankie - and - Annette musicals , the spirit is closer to the New Tastelessness exemplified by Ken Russell , minus Russell 's slick visual style ...
I 've never seen an uglier large - scale musical . "
David Ansen of Newsweek wrote , " Too often , ' Grease ' is simply mediocre , full of broad high - school humor , flat dramatic scenes and lethargic pacing .
Fortunately , there 's nothing flat about John Travolta ...
Travolta ca n't dominate this movie as he did ' Fever , ' but when he 's on screen you ca n't watch anyone else . "
Grease was voted the best musical ever on Channel 4 's 100 greatest musicals in 2004 .
The film holds a 75 % approval rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , based on 64 reviews with an average rating of 6.7/10 .
The website 's critical consensus reads , " Grease is a pleasing , energetic musical with infectiously catchy songs and an ode to young love that never gets old .
" It holds a score of 70/100 on the review aggregator Metacritic based on 15 reviews , indicating " generally favorable reviews " .
Grease premiered for the first time on American television in 1981 on ABC - TV .
