LANGUAGES OF SOUTH AFRICA
There are eleven official languages of South Africa : Afrikaans , English , Ndebele , Northern Sotho , Sotho , SiSwati , Tsonga , Tswana , Venda , Xhosa and Zulu .
Fewer than two percent of South Africans speak a first language other than an official one .
Most South Africans can speak more than one language .
Dutch and English were the first official languages of South Africa from 1910 to 1925 .
Afrikaans was added as a part of Dutch in 1925 , although in practice , Afrikaans effectively replaced Dutch , which fell into disuse .
When South Africa became a republic in 1961 , the official relationship changed such that Afrikaans was considered to include Dutch , and Dutch was dropped in 1984 , so between 1984 and 1994 , South Africa had two official languages : English and Afrikaans .
English being the second language of many South Africans is most likely the most commonly spoken language of the nation .
Many countries from around the world have turned to South Africa for their supply of low cost English and other educators .
Different government departments and official bodies use different terms to denote Northern Sotho .
In South Africa , Southern Ndebele is known simply as Ndebele , as most speakers of Northern Ndebele live in Zimbabwe .
Since taking power in the 1994 election , the ANC has promoted English as the main language of government , even if South Africans often take pride in using indigenous languages for any purpose .
Afrikaans also features prominently in commerce together with English , as the languages with the highest number of fluent speakers are Afrikaans and English .
In terms of linguistic classification , the official languages include two West Germanic languages ( English and Afrikaans ) and nine Southern Bantu languages .
Four of these are Nguni languages ( Zulu , Xhosa , Swati and Ndebele ) and three are Sotho – Tswana languages ( Northern Sotho , Southern Sotho , and Tswana ) .
Tsonga is a Tswa – Ronga language .
South African Sign Language is understood across the country , though sometimes sign - language interpreters use manually coded language .
LANGUAGE DEMOGRAPHICS Section::::Language demographics .
The most common language spoken as a first language by South Africans is Zulu ( 23 percent ) , followed by Xhosa ( 16 percent ) , and Afrikaans ( 14 percent ) .
English is the fourth most common first language in the country ( 9.6 % ) , but is understood in most urban areas and is the dominant language in government and the media .
The majority of South Africans speak a language from one of the two principal branches of the Bantu languages represented in South Africa : the Sotho – Tswana branch ( Sesotho , Northern Sotho , Tswana ) , or the Nguni branch ( Zulu , Xhosa , Swazi , Ndebele ) .
For each of the two groups , the languages within that group are for the most part intelligible to a native speaker of any other language within that group .
The nine indigenous African languages of South Africa can be divided into two geographical zones , with Nguni languages being predominant in the south - eastern third of the country ( Indian Ocean coast ) and Sesotho languages being predominant in the northern third of the country located further inland , as also in Botswana and Lesotho .
Gauteng is the most linguistically heterogeneous province , with roughly equal numbers of Nguni , Sesotho and Indo - European language speakers .
This has resulted in the spread of an urban argot , Tsotsitaal , in large urban townships in the province .
Afrikaans , a language derived from Dutch , is the most widely spoken language in the western half of the country ( Western and Northern Cape ) .
It is spoken as first language by approximately 61 percent of whites and 76 percent of Coloured ( multiracial ) people in the country .
Afrikaans is also spoken widely across the centre and north of the country , as a second ( or third or even fourth ) language by Black South Africans living in farming areas .

% OTHER SIGNIFICANT LANGUAGES SPOKEN IN SOUTH AFRICA
Section::::Other significant languages spoken in South Africa .
Other languages spoken in South Africa , though not mentioned in the Constitution , include Fanagalo , Lobedu ( Khilobedu ) , Northern Ndebele ( Sindebele ) , Phuthi ( Siphuthi ) .
Lobedu has been variously claimed to be a dialect of Northern Sotho and an autonomous language .
Fanagalo is a pidgin often used as a lingua franca in the mining industry .
Significant numbers of immigrants from Europe , elsewhere in Africa , and the Indian subcontinent means that a wide variety of other languages can also be found in parts of South Africa .
In the older immigrant communities there are : Greek , Gujarati , Hindi , Portuguese , Tamil , Telugu , Urdu , Yiddish , Italian and smaller numbers of Dutch , French and German speakers .
These non - official languages may be used in limited semi - official use where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent .
More importantly , these languages have significant local functions in specific communities whose identity is tightly bound around the linguistic and cultural identity that these non - official SA languages signal .
The fastest growing non - official language is Portuguese – first spoken by immigrants from Portugal , especially Madeira and later black and white settlers and refugees from Angola and Mozambique after they won independence from Portugal and now by more recent immigrants from those countries again – and increasingly French , spoken by immigrants and refugees from Francophone Central Africa .
More recently , speakers of North , Central and West Africa languages have arrived in South Africa , mostly in the major cities , especially in Johannesburg and Pretoria , but also Cape Town and Durban .
CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS Section::::Constitutional provisions .
Chapter 1 ( Founding Provisions ) , Section 6 ( Languages ) of the Constitution of South Africa is the basis for government language policy .
The English text of the constitution signed by president Nelson Mandela on 16 December 1996 uses ( mostly ) the names of the languages expressed in those languages themselves .
Sesotho refers to Southern Sotho , and isiNdebele refers to Southern Ndebele .
Controversy surrounds the designation of Northern Sesotho as Sepedi ( its main dialect ) instead of the comprehensive Sesotho sa Leboa ( which had been the wording in the Interim Constitution of 1993 ) .
The spelling of Venda is also incorrectly rendered as Tshivenda instead of the correct Tshivenḓa .
The constitution mentions " sign language " in the generic sense rather than South African Sign Language specifically .
