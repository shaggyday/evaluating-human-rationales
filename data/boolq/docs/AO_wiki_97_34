MASTERS TOURNAMENT
The Masters Tournament ( usually referred to as simply The Masters , or the U.S. Masters outside of North America ) is one of the four major championships in professional golf .
Scheduled for the first full week of April , the Masters is the first major of the year , and unlike the others , it is held at the same location , Augusta National Golf Club , a private course in the southeastern United States , in the city of Augusta , Georgia .
The Masters was started by noted amateur champion Bobby Jones and investment banker Clifford Roberts .
After his grand slam in 1930 , Jones acquired the former plant nursery and co - designed Augusta National with course architect Alister MacKenzie .
First played in 1934 , the tournament is an official money event on the PGA Tour , the European Tour , and the Japan Golf Tour .
The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event , held by the Augusta National Golf Club .
The tournament has a number of traditions .
Since 1949 , a green jacket has been awarded to the champion , who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory , although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions ' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom .
In most instances , only a first - time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds .
A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win ( unless he needs to be re - fitted with a new jacket ) .
The Champions Dinner , inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952 , is held on the Tuesday before each tournament , and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club .
Beginning in 1963 , legendary golfers , usually past champions , have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play .
These have included Fred McLeod , Jock Hutchinson , Gene Sarazen , Sam Snead , Byron Nelson , Arnold Palmer , Jack Nicklaus , and Gary Player .
Since 1960 , a semi - social contest at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday , the day before the first round .
Nicklaus has the most Masters wins , with six between 1963 and 1986 .
Palmer and Tiger Woods won four each , and five have won three titles at Augusta : Jimmy Demaret , Sam Snead , Gary Player , Nick Faldo , and Phil Mickelson .
Player , from South Africa , was the first non - American player to win the tournament , in 1961 ; the second was Seve Ballesteros of Spain , the champion in 1980 and 1983 .
The Augusta National course first opened in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects .
Among the changes : greens have been reshaped and , on occasion , entirely re - designed , bunkers have been added , water hazards have been extended , new tee boxes have been built , hundreds of trees have been planted , and several mounds have been installed .
HISTORY AUGUSTA NATIONAL GOLF CLUB Section::::History .
Section::::Augusta National Golf Club .
The idea for Augusta National originated with Bobby Jones , who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game .
He sought advice from Clifford Roberts , who later became the chairman of the club .
They came across a piece of land in Augusta , Georgia , of which Jones said : " Perfect !
And to think this ground has been lying here all these years waiting for someone to come along and lay a golf course upon it . "
The land had been an indigo plantation in the early nineteenth century and a plant nursery since 1857 .
Jones hired Alister MacKenzie to help design the course , and work began in 1931 .
The course formally opened in 1933 , but MacKenzie died before the first Masters Tournament was played .
EARLY TOURNAMENT YEARS
Section::::Early tournament years .
The first " Augusta National Invitational " Tournament , as the Masters was originally known , began on March 22 , 1934 , and was won by Horton Smith , who took the first prize of $ 1,500 .
The present name was adopted in 1939 .
The first tournament was played with current holes 10 through 18 played as the first nine , and 1 through 9 as the second nine then reversed permanently to its present layout for the 1935 tournament .
Initially the Augusta National Invitational field was composed of Bobby Jones ' close associates .
Jones had petitioned the USGA to hold the U.S. Open at Augusta but the USGA denied the petition , noting that the hot Georgia summers would create difficult playing conditions .
Gene Sarazen hit the " shot heard ' round the world " in 1935 , holing a shot from the fairway on the par 5 15th for a double eagle ( albatross ) .
This tied Sarazen with Craig Wood , and in the ensuing 36-hole playoff Sarazen was the victor by five strokes .
The tournament was not played from 1943 to 1945 , due to World War II .
To assist the war effort , cattle and turkeys were raised on the Augusta National grounds .
1960S–1970S Section::::1960s–1970s .
The Big Three of Arnold Palmer , Gary Player , and Jack Nicklaus dominated the Masters from 1960 through 1978 , winning the event 11 times among them during that span .
After winning by one stroke in 1958 , Palmer won by one stroke again in 1960 in memorable circumstances .
Trailing Ken Venturi by one shot in the 1960 event , Palmer made birdies on the last two holes to prevail .
Palmer would go on to win another two Masters in 1962 and 1964 .
Jack Nicklaus emerged in the early 1960s , and served as a rival to the popular Palmer .
Nicklaus won his first green jacket in 1963 , defeating Tony Lema by one stroke .
Two years later , he shot a then - course record of 271 ( 17 under par ) for his second Masters win , leading Bobby Jones to say that Nicklaus played " a game with which I am not familiar .
"
The next year , Nicklaus won his third green jacket in a grueling 18-hole playoff against Tommy Jacobs and Gay Brewer .
This made Nicklaus the first player to win consecutive Masters .
He won again in 1972 by three strokes .
In 1975 , Nicklaus won by one stroke in a close contest with Tom Weiskopf and Johnny Miller in one of the most exciting Masters to date .
Gary Player became the first non - American to win the Masters in 1961 , beating Palmer , the defending champion .
In 1974 , he won again by two strokes .
After not winning a tournament on the U.S. PGA tour for nearly four years , and at the age of 42 , Player won his third and final Masters in 1978 by one stroke over three players .
Player currently shares ( with Fred Couples ) the record of making 23 consecutive cuts , and has played in a record 52 Masters .
A controversial ending to the Masters occurred in 1968 .
Roberto De Vicenzo signed a scorecard ( scored by playing partner Tommy Aaron ) which incorrectly showed him as making a par 4 instead of a birdie 3 on the 17th hole of the final round .
By the rules of golf , if a player signs a scorecard ( thereby attesting to its veracity ) that records a score on a hole higher than what he actually made on the hole , the player receives the higher score for that hole .
This extra stroke cost De Vicenzo a chance to be in an 18-hole Monday playoff with Bob Goalby , who won the green jacket .
De Vicenzo 's mistake led to the famous quote , " What a stupid I am . "
In 1975 , Lee Elder became the first African American to play in the Masters , doing so 15 years before Augusta National admitted its first black member , Ron Townsend , as a result of the Shoal Creek Controversy .
1980S–2000S
Section::::1980s–2000s . Non - Americans collected 11 victories in 20 years in the 1980s and 1990s , by far the strongest run they have had in any of the three majors played in the United States since the early days of the U.S. Open .
The first European to win the Masters was Seve Ballesteros in 1980 .
Nicklaus became the oldest player to win the Masters in 1986 when he won for the sixth time at age 46 .
During this period , no golfer suffered from the pressure of competing at Augusta more than Greg Norman .
In 1987 , Norman lost a sudden - death playoff to Larry Mize when Mize holed out a remarkable 45-yard pitch shot to birdie the second playoff hole and win the Masters .
In 1996 , Norman tied the course record with an opening round 63 , and had a six - stroke lead over Nick Faldo entering the final round .
Norman shot a 78 while Faldo scored a 67 to win by five shots ( for his third Masters championship ) .
Norman also suffered in 1986 when after birdieing four straight holes , and needing only a par to tie Nicklaus for the lead and force a Monday playoff , he badly pushed his 4-iron approach on 18 and missed his par putt for a closing bogey .
At age 21 in 1997 , Tiger Woods won the Masters by twelve shots and broke the 72-hole record that had stood for 32 years .
Woods completed his " Tiger Slam " by winning his fourth straight major championship at the Masters in 2001 .
He won again the following year , making him only the third player in history to win the tournament in consecutive years , as well as in 2005 when he defeated Chris DiMarco in a playoff for his first major championship win in almost three years .
The club was targeted by Martha Burk , who organized a failed protest at the 2003 Masters to pressure the club into accepting female members .
Burk planned to protest at the front gates of Augusta National during the third day of the tournament , but her application for a permit to do so was denied .
A court appeal was dismissed .
In 2004 , Burk stated that she had no further plans to protest against the club .
Augusta National Chairman Billy Payne himself made headlines in April 2010 , however , when he commented ( at the annual pre - Masters press conference ) on Tiger Woods ' off - the - course behavior .
" It 's not simply the degree of his conduct that is so egregious here , " Payne said , in his opening speech .
" It is the fact he disappointed all of us and more importantly our kids and grandkids . "
The 2003 tournament was won by Mike Weir , who became the first Canadian to win a men 's major championship , and the first left - hander to win the Masters .
The following year , another left - hander , Phil Mickelson , won his first major championship by making a birdie on the final hole to beat Ernie Els by a stroke .
Mickelson also won the tournament in 2006 and 2010 .
In 2011 , the tournament was won by South African Charl Schwartzel , who birdied the final four holes to win by two strokes .
In 2012 , Bubba Watson won the tournament on the second playoff hole .
Watson 's win marked the fifth time that a left - hander won the Masters in the previous ten tournaments .
Prior to 2003 , no left - hander had ever won the Masters .
The 2013 Masters was won by Adam Scott , the first Australian to win the tournament .
Watson won the 2014 Masters by three strokes over Jordan Spieth and Jonas Blixt .
It was his second Masters victory in three years .
In 2015 , Spieth would become the second - youngest winner in just his second Masters .
TRADITIONS AWARDS Section::::Traditions .
Section::::Awards .
The total prize money for the 2014 tournament was $ 9,000,000 , with $ 1,620,000 going to the winner .
In the inaugural year of 1934 , the winner Horton Smith received $ 1,500 out of a $ 5,000 purse .
After Nicklaus 's first win in 1963 , he received $ 20,000 , while after his final victory in 1986 he won $ 144,000 .
In recent years the purse has grown quickly .
Between 2001 and 2014 , the winner 's share grew by $ 612,000 , and the purse grew by $ 3,400,000 .
In addition to a cash prize , the winner of the tournament is presented with a distinctive green jacket , formally awarded since 1949 , and informally acquired by the champions for many years before that .
The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds ; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club .
The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament , and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons .
Winners keep their jacket for the first year after their first victory , then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit .
The tradition began in 1949 , when Sam Snead won his first of three Masters titles .
The green jacket is only allowed to be removed from Augusta National by the reigning champion , after which it must remain at the club .
Exceptions to this rule include Gary Player , who in his joy of winning mistakenly took his jacket home to South Africa after his 1961 victory ( although he has always followed the spirit of the rule and has never worn the jacket ) ;
Seve Ballesteros who , in an interview with Peter Alliss from his home in Pedreña , showed one of his two green jackets in his trophy room ; and Henry Picard , whose jacket was removed from the club before the tradition was well established , remained in his closet for a number of years , and is now on display at Canterbury Golf Club in Beachwood , Ohio , where he was the club professional for many years .
By tradition , the winner of the previous year 's Masters Tournament puts the jacket on the current winner at the end of the tournament .
In 1966 , Jack Nicklaus became the first player to win in consecutive years and he donned the jacket himself .
When Nick Faldo ( in 1990 ) and Tiger Woods ( in 2002 ) repeated as champions , the chairman of Augusta National put the jacket on them .
There are several awards presented to players who perform exceptional feats during the tournament .
The player who has the daily lowest score receives a crystal vase , while players who score a hole - in - one or a double eagle win a large crystal bowl .
For each eagle a player makes he receives a pair of crystal goblets .
In addition to the green jacket , winners of the tournament receive a gold medal .
They have their names engraved on the actual silver Masters trophy , introduced in 1961 , which depicts the clubhouse .
This trophy remains at Augusta National ; since 1993 winners have received a sterling silver replica .
The runner - up receives a silver medal , introduced in 1951 .
Beginning in 1978 , a silver salver was added as an award for the runner - up .
In 1952 the Masters began presenting an award , known as the Silver Cup , to the lowest scoring amateur to make the cut .
In 1954 they began presenting an amateur silver medal to the low amateur runner - up .
In 2017 , a green jacket that was found at a thrift store in 1994 was sold at auction for $ 139,000 .
PRE - TOURNAMENT EVENTS Section::::Pre - tournament events .
In 2013 , Augusta National partnered with the USGA and the PGA of America to establish Drive , Chip and Putt , a youth golf skills competition which was first held in 2014 .
The event was established as part of an effort to help promote the sport of golf among youth ; the winners of local qualifiers in different age groups advance to the national finals , which have been held at Augusta National on the Sunday immediately preceding the Masters .
The driving and chipping portions of the event are held on the course 's practice range , but the putting portion has been played on the course 's 18th hole .
On April 4 , 2018 , prior to the 2018 tournament , new Augusta National chairman Fred Ridley announced that the club would host a new Women 's amateur championship beginning in 2019 .
The first two rounds will be held at the Champion 's Retreat club in Evans , Georgia , with the final two rounds hosted by Augusta National ( the final round will take place on the Saturday directly preceding the tournament ) .
Ridley stated that holding such an event at Augusta National would have the " greatest impact " on women 's golf .
Although concerns were raised that the event would conflict with the LPGA Tour 's Dinah Shore major ( which has invited top amateur players to compete ) , Ridley stated that he had discussed the event with commissioner Mike Whan , and stated that he agreed on the notion that any move to bolster the prominence of women 's golf would be a " win " for the LPGA over time .
PAR-3
CONTEST Section::::Par-3 contest .
The Par 3 Contest was first introduced in 1960 , and was won that year by Snead .
Since then it has traditionally been played on the Wednesday before the tournament starts .
The par 3 course was built in 1958 .
It is a nine - hole course , with a par of 27 , and measures in length .
There have been 94 holes - in - one in the history of the contest , with a record nine occurring in 2016 .
Camilo Villegas became the first player to card two holes - in - one in the same round during the 2015 Par 3 Contest .
No par 3 contest winner has also won the Masters in the same year .
There have been several repeat winners , including Pádraig Harrington , Sandy Lyle , Sam Snead , and Tom Watson .
The former two won in successive years .
In this event , golfers may use their children as caddies , which helps to create a family - friendly atmosphere .
In 2008 , the event was televised for the first time by ESPN .
The winner of the par 3 competition , which is played the day before the tournament begins , wins a crystal bowl .
PLAYER INVITATIONS
Section::::Player invitations .
As with the other majors , winning the Masters gives a golfer several privileges which make his career more secure .
Masters champions are automatically invited to play in the other three majors ( the U.S. Open , The Open Championship , and the PGA Championship ) for the next five years ( except for amateur winners , unless they turn pro within the five - year period ) , and earn a lifetime invitation to the Masters .
They also receive membership on the PGA Tour for the following five seasons and invitations to The Players Championship for five years .
Because the tournament was established by an amateur champion , Bobby Jones , the Masters has a tradition of honoring amateur golf .
It invites winners of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world .
Also , the current U.S. Amateur champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament .
Amateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the " Crow 's Nest " atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament .
The Crow 's Nest is with lodging space for five during the competition .
OPENING TEE SHOT Section::::Opening tee shot .
Since 1963 , the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole , typically by one or more legendary players .
The original honorary starters were Jock Hutchison and Fred McLeod ; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973 , when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club .
McLeod continued on until his death in 1976 .
Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981 , and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984 .
This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died , while Nelson stopped in 2001 .
Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002 , a little over a month before he died .
In 2007 , Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter .
Palmer also had the honor in 2008 and 2009 .
At the 2010 and 2011 Masters Tournaments , Jack Nicklaus joined Palmer as an honorary co - starter for the event .
In 2012 , Gary Player joined them .
Palmer announced in March 2016 that a lingering shoulder issue would prevent him from partaking in the 2016 tee shot .
Palmer was still in attendance for the ceremony .
Following Palmer 's death in 2016 , the 2017 ceremony featured tributes ; his green jacket was draped over an empty white chair , while everyone in attendance wore " Arnie 's Army " badges .
CHAMPIONS '
DINNER Section::::Champions ' Dinner .
The Champions ' Dinner is held each year on the Tuesday evening preceding Thursday 's first round .
The dinner was first held in 1952 , hosted by defending champion Ben Hogan , to honor the past champions of the tournament .
At that time 15 tournaments had been played , and the number of past champions was 11 .
Officially known as the " Masters Club " , it includes only past winners of the Masters , although selected members of the Augusta National Golf Club have been included as honorary members , usually the chairman .
The defending champion , as host , selects the menu for the dinner .
Frequently , Masters champions have served finely prepared cuisine by the Masters chef from their home regions .
Notable examples have included haggis , served by Scotsman Sandy Lyle in 1989 , and bobotie , a South African dish , served at the behest of 2008 champion Trevor Immelman .
Other examples include German Bernhard Langer 's 1986 Wiener schnitzel , Britain 's Nick Faldo 's fish and chips , Canadian Mike Weir 's elk and wild boar , and Vijay Singh 's seafood tom kah and chicken panang curry .
In 1997 , 1979 champion Fuzzy Zoeller created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken , dishes commonly associated with Afro - American culture , at the dinner .
The 2011 dinner of Phil Mickelson was a Spanish - themed menu in hopes that Seve Ballesteros would attend , but he was too sick to attend and died weeks later .
CADDIES Section::::Caddies .
Until 1983 , all players in the Masters were required to use the services of an Augusta National Club caddie , who by club tradition was always an African American man .
Indeed , club co - founder Clifford Roberts is reputed to have said , " As long as I 'm alive , golfers will be white , and caddies will be black .
" Since 1983 , players have been allowed the option of bringing their own caddie to the tournament .
The Masters requires caddies to wear a uniform consisting of a white jumpsuit , a green Masters cap , and white tennis shoes .
The surname , and sometimes first initial , of each player is found on the back of his caddie 's uniform .
The defending champion always receives caddie number " 1 " : other golfers get their caddie numbers from the order in which they register for the tournament .
The other majors and some PGA Tour events formerly had a similar policy concerning caddies well into the 1970s ; the U.S. Open first allowed players to use their own caddies in 1976 .
OTHER TRADITIONS
Section::::Other traditions .
The day after the tournament closes , The Bobby Jones Scholars from The University of St Andrews in Scotland play a four - ball round on the course – the last people to do so before the greenkeepers start the process of repairing and restoring the course to pre - tournament standard .
FORMAT Section::::Format .
The Masters is the first major championship of the year .
Since 1948 , its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April , with several exceptions .
It ended on the first Sunday four times ( 1952 , 1957 , 1958 , 1959 ) and the 1979 and 1984 tournaments ended on April 15 , the month 's third Sunday .
The first edition in 1934 was held in late March and the next ten were in early April , with only the 1942 event scheduled to end on the second Sunday .
Similar to the other majors , the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each , Thursday through Sunday ( when there are no delays ) .
The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders , when compared with other golf tournaments , so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds ( 36 holes ) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees , unless weather shortens the available playing time .
The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA .
Originally , the Masters was the only tournament to use two - man pairings during the first two rounds .
It was also the only event to re - pair based on the leaderboard before Friday 's round , as most tournaments only do this on the weekend .
This practice ended in the early 2000s , when the Masters switched to the more standard three - man groups and the groups are now kept in - tact on Friday , with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds .
After 36 holes of play , a cut - off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds .
To " make the cut " , players must be either in the top 50 places ( ties counting ) , or within 10 strokes of the leader 's score .
These criteria have applied since 2013 .
From 1957 to 1960 , the top 40 scores ( including ties ) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut .
From 1961 to 2012 , it was the top 44 ( and ties ) or within 10 strokes of the lead .
Before 1957 , there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds , if desired .
Following the cut , an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days .
Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner , all players tied for the lead enter a sudden - death playoff .
Play begins on the 18th hole , followed by the adjacent 10th , repeating until one player remains .
Adopted in 1976 , the sudden - death playoff was originally formatted to start on the first hole , but was not needed for the first three years .
It was changed for 1979 to the inward ( final ) nine holes , starting at the tenth tee , where the television coverage began .
First employed that same year , the Masters ' first sudden - death playoff ended on the eleventh green .
The current arrangement , beginning at the 18th tee , was amended for 2004 and first used the following year .
Through 2017 , the eleven sudden - death playoffs have yet to advance past the second extra hole .
Earlier playoffs were 18 holes on the following day , except for the first in 1935 , which was 36 holes ; the last 18-hole playoff was in 1970 , and none of the full - round playoffs went to additional holes .

COURSE ADJUSTMENTS Section::::Course adjustments .
As with many other courses , Augusta National 's championship setup was lengthened in recent years .
In 2001 , the course measured and was extended to for 2002 , and again in 2006 to ; longer than the 2001 course .
The changes attracted many critics , including the most successful players in Masters history , Jack Nicklaus , Arnold Palmer , Gary Player and Tiger Woods .
Woods claimed that the " shorter hitters are going to struggle . "
Augusta National chairman Hootie Johnson was unperturbed , stating , " We are comfortable with what we are doing with the golf course . "
After a practice round , Gary Player defended the changes , saying , " There have been a lot of criticisms , but I think unjustly so , now I 've played it ...
The guys are basically having to hit the same second shots that Jack Nicklaus had to hit ( in his prime ) " .
Originally , the grass on the putting greens was the wide - bladed Bermuda .
The greens lost speed , especially during the late 1970s , after the introduction of a healthier strain of narrow - bladed Bermuda , which thrived and grew thicker .
In 1978 , the greens on the par 3 course were reconstructed with bentgrass , a narrow - bladed species that could be mowed shorter , eliminating grain .
After this test run , the greens on the main course were replaced with bentgrass in time for the 1981 Masters .
The bentgrass resulted in significantly faster putting surfaces , which has required a reduction in some of the contours of the greens over time .
Just before the 1975 tournament , the common beige sand in the bunkers was replaced with the now - signature white feldspar .
It is a quartz derivative of the mining of feldspar and is shipped in from North Carolina .
FIELD Section::::Field .
The Masters has the smallest field of the major championships , with 90–100 players .
Unlike other majors , there are no alternates or qualifying tournaments .
It is an invitational event , with invitations largely issued on an automatic basis to players who meet published criteria .
The top 50 players in the Official World Golf Ranking are all invited .
Past champions are always eligible , but since 2002 the Augusta National Golf Club has discouraged them from continuing to participate at an advanced age .
Some will later become honorary starters .

centerT50 RECORDS Section::::Records .
Jack Nicklaus has won the most Masters ( six ) and was old when he won in 1986 , making him the oldest winner of the Masters .
Nicklaus is the record holder for the most top tens , with 22 , and the most cuts made , with 37 .
The youngest winner of the Masters is Tiger Woods , who was old when he won in 1997 .
In that year Woods also broke the records for the widest winning margin ( 12 strokes ) , and the lowest winning score , with 270 ( −18 ) .
Jordan Spieth tied his score record in 2015 .
In 2013 , Guan Tianlang became the youngest player ever to compete in the Masters , at age on the opening day of the tournament ; the following day , he became the youngest ever to make the cut at the Masters or any men 's major championship .
Gary Player holds the record for most appearances , with 52 .
Player also holds the record for the number of consecutive cuts made , with 23 between 1959 and 1982 ( Player did not compete in 1973 as he was recovering from recent surgery ) .
He shares this record with Fred Couples , who made his consecutive cuts between 1983 and 2007 , not competing in 1987 and 1994 .
Nick Price and Greg Norman share the course record of 63 , with their rounds coming in 1986 and 1996 respectively .
The highest winning score of 289 ( +1 ) has occurred three times :
Sam Snead in 1954 , Jack Burke , Jr. in 1956 , and Zach Johnson in 2007 .
Anthony Kim holds the record for most birdies in a round with 11 in 2009 during his second round .
There have been only four double eagles carded in the history of the Masters ; the latest was by a contender in the fourth round in 2012 .
In the penultimate pairing with eventual champion Bubba Watson , Louis Oosthuizen 's downhill 4 iron from the fairway made the left side of the green at the par-5 second hole , called Pink Dogwood , rolled downhill , and in .
The other two rare occurrences of this feat after Sarazen 's double eagle on the fabled course 's Fire Thorn hole in 1935 : Bruce Devlin made double eagle from out with a 4-wood at the eighth hole ( Yellow Jasmine ) in the first round in 1967 , while Jeff Maggert hit a 3-iron at the 13th hole ( Azalea ) in the fourth round in 1994 .
Three players share the record for most runner - up finishes with four : Ben Hogan ( 1942 , 1946 , 1954 , 1955 ) , Tom Weiskopf ( 1969 , 1972 , 1974 , 1975 ) , Jack Nicklaus ( 1964 , 1971 , 1977 , 1981 )
BROADCASTING UNITED STATES
TELEVISION
Section::::Broadcasting .
Section::::United States television .
CBS has televised the Masters in the United States every year since 1956 , when it used six cameras and covered only the final four holes .
Tournament coverage of the first eight holes did not begin until 1993 because of resistance from the tournament organizers , but by 2006 , more than 50 cameras were used .
Chairman Jack Stephens felt that the back nine was always more " compelling " , increased coverage would increase the need for sponsorship spending , and that broadcasting the front nine of the course on television would cut down on attendance and television viewership for the tournament .
USA Network added first- and second - round coverage in 1982 .
In 2008 , ESPN replaced USA as broadcaster of early - round coverage .
These broadcasts use the CBS Sports production staff and commentators , but with ESPN personality Scott Van Pelt ( succeeding Mike Tirico , who replaced Bill Macatee 's similar role under USA Network ) as studio host .
In 2005 , CBS broadcast the tournament with high - definition fixed and handheld wired cameras , as well as standard - definition wireless handheld cameras .
In 2006 , a webstream called " Amen Corner Live " began providing coverage of all players passing through holes 11 , 12 , and 13 through all four rounds .
This was the first full tournament multi - hole webcast from a major championship .
In 2007 , CBS added " Masters Extra , " an extra hour of full - field bonus coverage daily on the internet , preceding the television broadcasts .
In 2008 , CBS added full coverage of holes 15 and 16 live on the web .
In 2011 , " Masters Extra " was dropped after officials gave ESPN an extra hour each day on Thursday and Friday .
In 2016 , the Amen Corner feed was broadcast in 4 K ultra high definition exclusively on DirecTV — as one of the first live U.S. sports telecasts in the format .
A second channel of 4 K coverage covering holes 15 and 16 was added in 2017 , and this coverage was produced with high - dynamic - range ( HDR ) color in 2018 .
While Augusta National Golf Club has consistently chosen CBS as its U.S. broadcast partner , it has done so in successive one - year contracts .
Former CBS Sports president Neal Pilson stated that their relationship had gotten to the point where the contracts could be negotiated in just hours .
Due to the lack of long - term contractual security , as well as the club 's limited dependence on broadcast rights fees ( owing to its affluent membership ) , it is widely held that CBS allows Augusta National greater control over the content of the broadcast , or at least performs some form of self - censorship , in order to maintain future rights .
The club , however , has insisted it does not make any demands with respect to the content of the broadcast .
Despite this , announcers who have been deemed not to have acted with the decorum expected by the club have been removed , notably Jack Whitaker and Gary McCord , and there also tends to be a lack of discussion of any controversy involving Augusta National , such as the 2003 Martha Burk protests .
Coverage itself carries a more formal style than other golf telecasts ; announcers refer to the gallery as patrons rather than as spectators or fans .
Gallery itself is also used .
The club also disallows promotions for other network programs , or other forms of sponsored features .
Significant restrictions have been placed on the tournament 's broadcast hours compared to other major championships .
Only in the 21st century did the tournament allow CBS to air 18-hole coverage of the leaders , a standard at the other three majors .
Since 1982 , CBS has used " Augusta " by Dave Loggins as the event telecast 's distinctive theme music .
Loggins originally came up with the song during his first trip to the Augusta course in 1981 .
The club mandates minimal commercial interruption , currently limited to four minutes per hour ( as opposed to the usual 12 or more ) ; this is subsidized by selling exclusive sponsorship packages to two or three companies – currently these " global sponsors " are AT&T , IBM , and Mercedes - Benz .
AT&T ( then SBC ) and IBM have sponsored the tournament since 2005 , joined at first by ExxonMobil , which in 2014 was replaced as a global sponsor by Mercedes - Benz .
In 2002 , in the wake of calls to boycott tournament sponsors over the Martha Burk controversy , club chairman Hootie Johnson suspended all television sponsorship of the 2003 tournament .
He argued that it was " unfair " to have the Masters ' sponsors become involved with the controversy by means of association with the tournament , as their sponsorship is of the Masters and not Augusta National itself .
CBS agreed to split production costs for the tournament with the club to make up for the lack of sponsorship .
After the arrangement continued into 2004 , the tournament reinstated sponsorships for 2005 , with the new partners of ExxonMobil , IBM , and SBC .
The club also sells separate sponsorship packages , which do not provide rights to air commercials on the U.S. telecasts , to two " international partners " ; in 2014 , those companies were Rolex and UPS ( the latter of which replaced Mercedes - Benz upon that company 's elevation to " global sponsor " status ) .
RADIO COVERAGE Section::::Radio coverage .
WestwoodOne ( previously Dial Global and CBS Radio ) has provided live radio play - by - play coverage in the United States since 1956 .
This coverage can also be heard on the official Masters website .
The network provides short two- or three - minute updates throughout the tournament , as well as longer three- and four - hour segments towards the end of the day .
INTERNATIONAL TELEVISION
Section::::International television .
The BBC has broadcast the Masters in the UK since 1986 , and it also provides live radio commentary on the closing stages on Radio Five Live .
With the 2007 launch of BBC HD , UK viewers can now watch the championship in that format .
BBC Sport held the TV and radio rights through to 2010 .
The BBC 's coverage airs without commercials because it is financed by a licence fee .
From the 2011 Masters , Sky Sports began broadcasting all four days , as well as the par 3 contest in HD and , for the first time ever , in 3D. The BBC will only have highlights of the first two days ' play but will go head to head with Sky Sports , with full live coverage on the final two days of play .
In Ireland , Setanta Ireland previously showed all four rounds , and now since 2017 Eir Sport broadcast all four rounds live having previously broadcast the opening two rounds with RTÉ broadcasting the weekend coverage .
In Canada , broadcast rights to the Masters are held by Bell Media , with coverage divided between TSN ( cable ) , which carries live simulcasts and primetime encores of CBS and ESPN coverage for all four rounds , CTV ( broadcast ) , which simulcasts CBS 's coverage of the weekend rounds , and RDS , which carries French - language coverage .
Prior to 2013 , Canadian broadcast rights were held by a marketing company , Graham Sanborn Media , which in turn bought time on the Global Television Network , TSN , and RDS ( except for 2012 when French - language coverage aired on TVA and TVA Sports ) to air the broadcasts , also selling all of the advertising for the Canadian broadcasts .
This was an unusual arrangement in Canadian sports broadcasting , as in most cases broadcasters acquire their rights directly from the event organizers or through partnerships with international rightsholders , such as ESPN International ( ESPN owns a minority stake in TSN ) .
In 2013 , Global and TSN began selling advertising directly , and co - produced supplemental programs covering the tournament
( while still carrying U.S. coverage for the tournament itself ) .
On December 15 , 2015 , TSN parent company Bell Media announced that it had acquired exclusive Canadian rights to the tournament beginning 2016 under a multi - year deal .
Broadcast television coverage moved to co - owned broadcast network CTV , while TSN uses its expanded five - channel service to carry supplemental feeds ( including the Amen Corner feed and early coverage of each round ) that were previously exclusive to digital platforms .
In 53 countries , including much of Latin America , broadcast rights for the entire tournament are held by the ESPN International networks .
TICKETING
Section::::Ticketing .
Although tickets for the Masters are not expensive , they are very difficult to come by .
Even the practice rounds can be difficult to get into .
Applications for practice round tickets have to be made nearly a year in advance and the successful applicants are chosen by random ballot .
Tickets to the actual tournament are sold only to members of a patrons list , which is closed .
A waiting list for the patrons list was opened in 1972 and closed in 1978 .
It was reopened in 2000 and subsequently closed once again .
In 2008 , the Masters also began allowing children ( between the ages of 8 and 16 ) to enter on tournament days free if they are accompanied by the patron who is the owner of his or her badge .
The difficulty in acquiring Masters badges has made the tournament one of the largest events on the secondary - ticket market .
A majority of the badges for the Masters are delivered to the same group of patrons , fans , and members each year , and these perennial ticket holders sometimes decide to sell their badges through large ticket marketplaces such as StubHub , TicketCity , and VividSeats .
Some of these marketplaces will allow fans to purchase a Masters badge for a single day , as opposed to the traditional 4-day pass .
