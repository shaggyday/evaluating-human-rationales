FORMAT CHANGES
Section::::Format changes .
On 9 December 2016 , UEFA confirmed the reforming plan for the UEFA Champions League for the 2018–2021 cycle , which was announced on 26 August 2016 .
As per the new regulations , the previous season 's UEFA Europa League winners will qualify automatically for the UEFA Champions League group stage ( previously they would qualify for the play - off round , but would be promoted to the group stage only if the Champions League title holder berth was vacated , although this promotion to the group stage had been made in all three seasons since it was established from 2015–16 ) .
Meanwhile , the top four teams from the leagues of the four top - ranked national associations in the UEFA country coefficients list will qualify automatically for the group stage as well .
Only six teams will qualify for the group stage via the qualification rounds , down from ten in the previous season .
ASSOCIATION TEAM ALLOCATION Section::::Association team allocation .
79 teams from 54 of the 55 UEFA member associations participate in the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League ( the exception being Liechtenstein , which does not organise a domestic league ) .
The association ranking based on the UEFA country coefficients is used to determine the number of participating teams for each association :
* Associations 1–4 each have four teams qualify .
* Associations 5–6 each have three teams qualify .
* Associations 7–15 each have two teams qualify .
* Associations 16–55 ( except Liechtenstein ) each have one team qualify .
*
The winners of the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League and 2017–18 UEFA Europa League are each given an additional entry if they do not qualify for the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League through their domestic league .
*
The winners of the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League , Real Madrid , have qualified through their domestic league , meaning the additional entry for the Champions League title holders is not necessary .
*
The winners of the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League , Atlético Madrid , have qualified through their domestic league , meaning the additional entry for the Europa League title holders is not necessary .
ASSOCIATION RANKING
