FIFA WORLD CUP HOSTS Seventeen countries have been FIFA World Cup hosts in the competition 's twenty tournaments since the inaugural World Cup in 1930 .
The organization at first awarded hosting to countries at meetings of FIFA 's congress .
The choice of location was controversial in the earliest tournaments , given the three - week boat journey between South America and Europe , the two centers of strength in football at the time .
The decision to hold the first cup in Uruguay , for example , led to only four European nations competing .
The next two World Cups were both held in Europe .
The decision to hold the second of these , the 1938 FIFA World Cup , in France was controversial , as the South American countries had been led to understand that the World Cup would rotate between the two continents .
Both Argentina and Uruguay thus boycotted the tournament .
The first tournament following World War II , held in Brazil in 1950 , had three teams withdraw for either financial problems or disagreements with the organization .
To avoid any future boycotts or controversy , FIFA began a pattern of alternation between the Americas and Europe , which continued until the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Asia .
The system evolved so that the host country is now chosen in a vote by FIFA 's Congress .
This is done under an exhaustive ballot system .
The decision is currently made roughly seven years in advance of the tournament , though the hosts for the 2022 tournament were chosen at the same time as those for the 2018 tournament .
Only Mexico , Italy , France , Germany ( West Germany until shortly after the 1990 World Cup ) and Brazil have hosted the event on two occasions .
Mexico City 's Estadio Azteca and Rio de Janeiro 's Maracanã are the only venues ever to have hosted two FIFA World Cup finals .
Only the 2002 FIFA World Cup had more than one host , being split between Japan and South Korea .
Upon the selection of Canada – Mexico – United States bid for the 2026 FIFA World Cup , the tournament will be the first to be hosted by more than two countries .
Mexico becomes the first country to host three men 's World Cups and its Estadio Azteca , should it be selected , will become the first stadium to stage three World Cup tournaments .

Initially , the two Asian countries were competitors in the bidding process .
But just before the vote , they agreed with FIFA to co - host the event .
However , the rivalry and distance between them led to organizational and logistical problems .
FIFA has said that co - hosting is not likely to happen again , and in 2004 officially stated that its statutes did not allow co - hosting bids .
2006
FIFA WORLD CUP Section::::2006 FIFA World Cup .
Bids : CONTROVERSY Section::::Controversy .
The controversy over the decision to award the 2006 FIFA World Cup to Germany led to a further change in practice .
The final tally was 12 votes to 11 in favour of Germany over the contenders South Africa , who had been favorites to win .
New Zealand FIFA member Charlie Dempsey , who was instructed to vote for South Africa by the Oceania Football Confederation , abstained from voting at the last minute .
If he had voted for the South African bid , the tally would have been 12–12 , giving the decision to FIFA President Sepp Blatter , who , it was widely believed , would then have voted for South Africa .
Dempsey was among eight members of the Executive Committee to receive a fax by editors of the German satirical magazine Titanic on Wednesday , the night before the vote , promising a cuckoo clock and Black Forest ham in exchange for voting for Germany .
He argued that the pressure from all sides including " an attempt to bribe " him had become too much for him .
On 4 August 2000 , consequently , FIFA decided to rotate the hosting of the final tournaments between its constituent confederations .
This was until October 2007 , during the selection of the host for the 2014 FIFA World Cup , when they announced that they will no longer continue with their continental rotation policy ( see below ) .
2010 FIFA WORLD CUP Section::::2010
FIFA World Cup .
Bids :
The first World Cup bidding process under continental rotation ( the process of rotating hosting of the World Cup to each confederation in turn ) was the 2010 FIFA World Cup , the first World Cup to be held in Africa .
On 7 July 2001 , during the FIFA Congress in Buenos Aires , a decision was ratified , which was that the rotation will begin in Africa .
On 23 September 2002 , FIFA 's Executive Committee confirmed that only African member associations , would be invited to submit bids to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup .
In January 2003 , Nigeria entered the bidding process , but withdrew their bid in September .
In March 2003 , Sepp Blatter initially said Nigeria 's plan to co host the 2010 FIFA World Cup with four African countries would not work .
Nigeria had originally hoped to bid jointly with West African neighbours Benin , Ghana , and Togo .
After it was confirmed by FIFA that joint bidding would not be allowed in the future , Libya and Tunisia withdrew both of their bids on 8 May 2004 .
On 15 May 2004 in Zürich ( the seventh consecutive time that a host selection has been made there ) , South Africa , after a narrow loss in the 2006 bidding , defeated perennial candidate Morocco to host , 14 votes to 10 .
Egypt received no votes .

On 28 May 2015 , media covering the 2015 FIFA corruption case reported that high - ranking officials from the South African bid committee had secured the right to host the World Cup by paying US$ 10 million in bribes to then - FIFA Vice President Jack Warner and to other FIFA Executive Committee members .
On 4 June 2015 , FIFA executive Chuck Blazer , having co - operated with the FBI and the Swiss authorities , confirmed that he and the other members of FIFA 's executive committee were bribed in order to promote the South African 1998 and 2010 World Cups .
Blazer stated , " I and others on the FIFA executive committee agreed to accept bribes in conjunction with the selection of South Africa as the host nation for the 2010 World Cup . "
On 6 June 2015 , The Daily Telegraph reported that Morocco had received the most votes , but South Africa was awarded the tournament instead .
2014 FIFA WORLD CUP Section::::2014 FIFA World Cup .
Bids : FIFA continued its continental rotation procedure by earmarking the 2014 World Cup for South America .
FIFA initially indicated that it might back out of the rotation concept , but later decided to continue it through the 2014 host decision , after which it was dropped .
Colombia had expressed interest in hosting the 2014 World Cup , but withdrew undertaking the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup .
Brazil also expressed interest in hosting the World Cup .
CONMEBOL , the South American Football Federation , indicated their preference for Brazil as a host .
Brazil was the only nation to submit a formal bid when the official bidding procedure for CONMEBOL member associations was opened in December 2006 , as by that time , Colombia , Chile and Argentina had already withdrawn , and Venezuela was not allowed to bid .
Brazil made the first unopposed bid since the initial selection of the 1986 FIFA World Cup 2018 AND 2022 FIFA WORLD CUPS Section::::2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups . 2018
Bids : 2022
Bids :
FIFA announced on 29 October 2007 that it will no longer continue with its continental rotation policy , implemented after the 2006 World Cup host selection .
The newest host selection policy is that any country may bid for a World Cup , provided that their continental confederation has not hosted either of the past two World Cups .
For the 2018 World Cup bidding process , this meant that bids from Africa and South America were not allowed .
For the 2022 World Cup bidding process , this meant that bids from South America and Europe were not allowed .
Also , FIFA formally allowed joint bids once more ( after they were banned in 2002 ) , because there was only one organizing committee per joint bid , unlike Korea – Japan , which had two different organizing committees .
Countries that announced their interest included Australia , England , Indonesia , Japan , Qatar , Russia , South Korea , United States , the joint bid of Spain and Portugal and the joint bid of Belgium and Netherlands .
The hosts for both World Cups were announced by the FIFA Executive Committee on 2 December 2010 .
Russia was selected to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup , making it the first time that the World Cup will be hosted in Eastern Europe and making it the biggest country geographically to host the World Cup .
Qatar was selected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup , making it the first time a World Cup will be held in the Arab World and the second time in Asia since the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan .
Also , the decision made it the smallest country geographically to host the World Cup .

In June 2017 , UEFA stated that " it would support a pan - British bid for 2030 or even a single bid from England . "
Moreover , a possible English bid for 2030 was also backed by the German Football Association .
On 15 July 2018 , Deputy Leader of the UK Labour Party , Tom Watson , said in an interview that he and his party backed a 2030 World Cup bid for the UK saying that " I hope it 's one of the first things a Labour government does , which is work with our FA to try and put a World Cup bid together . "
On 16 July 2018 , British Prime Minister Theresa May expressed her support of the bid and her openness about discussions with football authorities .
Although there had been no prior discussion with the Football Association , the Scottish FA also expressed its interest about joining a Home Nations bid .
Former Scottish First Minister Henry McLeish has called the Scottish government and the Scottish Football Association to bid for the 2030 FIFA World Cup with the other British nations .

FIFA WORLD CUP Section::::2034 FIFA World Cup .
The bidding process for this World Cup has yet to start .
Some early bids for the 2034 FIFA World Cup have however been proposed .
The first bid for the 2034 FIFA World Cup has been proposed as a collective bid by the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations .
The idea of a combined ASEAN bid had been mooted as early as January 2011 , when the former Football Association of Singapore President , Zainudin Nordin , said in a statement that the proposal had been made at an ASEAN Foreign Ministers meeting , despite the fact that countries can not bid ( as that 's up to national associations ) .
In 2013 , Nordin and Special Olympics Malaysia President , Datuk Mohamed Feisol Hassan , recalled the idea for ASEAN to jointly host a World Cup .
Under FIFA rules as of 2017 , the 2030 World Cup can not be held in Asia ( AFC ) as Asian Football Confederation members are excluded from the bidding following the selection of Qatar in 2022 .
Therefore , the earliest bid by an AFC member could be made for 2034 .
Later , Malaysia withdrew from involvement but Singapore and other ASEAN countries continued the campaign to submit a joint bid for the World Cup in 2034 .
In February 2017 , ASEAN held talks on launching a joint bid during a visit by FIFA President Gianni Infantino to Yangon , Myanmar .
On 1 July 2017 , Vice General Chairman of the Football Association of Indonesia Joko Driyono said that Indonesia and Thailand were set to lead a consortium of Southeast Asian nations in the bid .
Driyono added that due to geographic and infrastructure considerations and the expanded format ( 48 teams ) , at least 2 or 3 ASEAN countries combined would be in a position necessary to host matches .
In September 2017 , the Thai League 1 Deputy CEO Benjamin Tan , at the ASEAN Football Federation ( AFF ) Council meeting , confirmed that his Association has " put in their interest to bid and co - host " the 2034 World Cup with Indonesia .
On the same occasion , the General Secretary of the AFF , Dato Sri Azzuddin Ahmad , confirmed that Indonesia and Thailand will submit a joint bid .
Indonesia is the only Southeast Asian country to have participated in the World Cup , when the territory was known as the Dutch East Indies .
However in June 2018 , FIFA executive committee member and crown prince and regent of Pahang , Tengku Abdullah who is also the former President of the Football Association of Malaysia ( FAM ) expressed interest in joining the three countries in hosting the World Cup together .
The four countries have jointly hosted a football event before during the 2007 AFC Asian Cup .
If the FAM agrees to rejoin the project , they would be the first to submit a four - country joint bid in the FIFA World Cup history .
The second bid is from Egypt .
Its Sports and Youth Minister Ashraf Sobhy said that Egypt has considered a bid to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup .
Such a bid should be prepared by the national football association rather than the country .
