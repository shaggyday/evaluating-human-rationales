SWEAT ALLERGY
A sweat allergy is the exacerbation of atopic dermatitis associated with an elevated body temperature and resulting increases in the production of sweat .
It appears as small reddish wheals that become visible in response to increased temperature and resulting production of sweat .
It can affect all ages .
Sweating can trigger intense itching or cholinergic urticaria .
The protein MGL_1304 secreted by mycobiota present on the skin such as Malassezia globosa acts as a histamine or antigen .
People can be desensitized using their own samples of sweat that have been purified that contains small amounts of the allergen .
The allergy is not due to the sweat itself but instead to an allergy - producing protein secreted by bacteria found on the skin .
Cholinergic urticaria ( CU ) is one of the physical urticaria which is provoked during sweating events such as exercise , bathing , staying in a heated environment , or emotional stress .
The hives produced are typically smaller than classic hives and are generally shorter - lasting .
Multiple subtypes have been elucidated , each of which require distinct treatment .
Tannic - acid has been found to suppress the allergic response along with showering .
