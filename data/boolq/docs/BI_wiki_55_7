EARLY YEARS
Section::::Early years .
Faulk was born and raised in New Orleans , Louisiana .
He attended Carver High School in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans , where he played for the Carver Rams high school football team .
Also a standout track sprinter , Faulk was timed at 10.3 seconds in the 100 meters , 21.74 over 200 meters and 49.4 in the 400 meters ..
Growing up , Faulk worked selling popcorn at New Orleans Saints games in the Louisiana Superdome COLLEGE CAREER
Section::::College career .
Faulk received an athletic scholarship to attend San Diego State University , and played as a running back for the San Diego State Aztecs football team .
One of the best performances of his career was against the University of the Pacific on September 14 , 1991 in just his second collegiate game .
In 37 carries , he amassed 386 yards and scored seven touchdowns , both records for freshmen ( the 386 yards were a then - NCAA record ) .
" Faulk had scoring runs of 61 , 7 , 47 , 9 , 5 , 8 and 25 yards . " That performance sparked one of the greatest freshman seasons in NCAA history , gaining 1,429 yards rushing , with 23 total touchdowns ( 21 rushing ) , and 140 points scored .
Faulk went on to better 1,600 yards rushing in his sophomore year .
In Faulk 's junior season in 1993 , he was finally able to showcase his all - purpose ability by catching 47 passes for 640 yards and 3 touchdowns to go with 1,530 yards and 21 touchdowns on the ground .
These numbers put Faulk 3rd in the nation in all - purpose yardage that year , and 2nd in scoring .
Faulk left San Diego State University with many of the school 's offensive records , among them 5,562 all - purpose yards and 62 career touchdowns , which is the 8th most in NCAA history .
After his 1992 season at SDSU , Faulk finished second in the Heisman Trophy award voting , losing to quarterback Gino Torretta in what was considered a notable snub in the history of the award : Torretta 's 1992 Miami Hurricanes football team had gone undefeated in the regular season and was ranked No . 1 in the country before the Heisman balloting , Faulk 's team finished with a middling 5 - 5 - 1 record , continuing a trend of the Heisman going to the most notable player on one of the nation 's best teams .
ESPN analyst Lee Corso led a campaign supporting Torretta for the Heisman and left Marshall Faulk off of his ballot .
He was a Heisman finalist as well in 1991 ( 9th ) and 1993 ( 4th ) .
PROFESSIONAL CAREER 1994
NFL DRAFT Section::::Professional career .
Section::::1994
NFL Draft .
Along with defensive tackle Dan Wilkinson and quarterbacks Heath Shuler and Trent Dilfer , Faulk was regarded as " one of the four players who rank well above the others in this draft " .
On February 14 , 1994 , at the NFL Scouting Combine Faulk ran a 4.28 forty - yard dash .
and on March 31 , he ran a 4.35 forty - yard time at the San Diego State Pro Day .
The Bengals held the No . 1 pick in the 1994 NFL Draft , and contemplated combining their heavy - duty runner Harold Green with the explosive Faulk , but eventually picked Wilkinson , leaving Faulk for the Indianapolis Colts .
INDIANAPOLIS COLTS ( 1994–1998 ) Section::::Indianapolis Colts ( 1994–1998 ) .
Faulk was drafted 2nd overall in the 1994 NFL Draft by the Indianapolis Colts , who were in desperate need of a running game .
On July 25 , 1994 , Faulk signed a seven - year $ 17.2 million contract and received a $ 5.1 million signing bonus .
Faulk responded by rushing for 1,282 yards , 11 touchdowns , and one receiving touchdown .
The Colts improved to 8 - 8 .
Marshall Faulk , later that season , would become the first NFL player to win both the Offensive Rookie of the Year Award and the Pro Bowl 's Most Valuable Player Award in the same season .
He was also the first rookie to win Pro Bowl MVP .
The next season Faulk rushed for 1,078 yards and 14 total touchdowns .
The Colts made the postseason , going 9 - 7 , and narrowly missed the Super Bowl after a close loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship Game which Faulk missed due to a nagging toe injury .
The next year was a miserable one for Faulk .
Because of a toe injury he suffered earlier in the season , he rushed for only 587 yards , with a 3 yards - per - carry average .
He led the Colts in yards from scrimmage with 1,015 .
He recovered from the injury and rushed for 1,000 + yards in each of the next two seasons , setting a new personal high with 1,319 in 1998 .
He also caught 86 passes for 906 yards that year ( playing alongside rookie quarterback Peyton Manning ) and was the AFC & NFL 's leader in total yards from scrimmage with an astounding 2,227 , beating out Denver 's MVP running back Terrell Davis by 2 yards , while also finishing 4th in the league in receptions .
It would also be the first of an NFL - record 4 consecutive 2,000 + total - yard seasons .
ST .
LOUIS RAMS ( 1999–2005 ) Section::::St .
Louis Rams ( 1999–2005 ) .
Faulk was traded to the St. Louis Rams the following season due to , according to his agent , Rocky Arceneaux , having outplayed his contract .
Faulk had missed practices and was considering holding out for a new contract .
Colts president Bill Polian did not want his young team 's chemistry damaged ( especially with the budding Manning at the quarterback position ) , so he traded Faulk for second- and fifth - round picks in the upcoming draft ( used to draft LB Mike Peterson and DE Brad Scioli ) .
The Colts moved on at the position , drafting Edgerrin James in the first round .
Faulk held out for twelve days as the details of his contract were worked out .
On August 4 , 1999 , Faulk signed a seven - year , $ 45.2 million contract with the Rams , which was the biggest deal in team history at the time .
In it Faulk was guaranteed $ 9.6 million including a $ 7-million signing bonus .
The problem in negotiations was the proposed fifth year , in which Faulk would get $ 7 million in salary and a $ 5-million roster bonus .
The deal was structured to prevent Faulk from ever being tagged a transition or franchise player .
In his first year in St. Louis , Faulk was the catalyst for " The Greatest Show on Turf " , a nickname given to coordinator Mike Martz 's aggressive Coryell - style offense .
In this offense he put up some of the best all - purpose numbers in the history of the NFL .
Faulk 's patience and diligence in learning the Rams ' offense paid off when he totaled an NFL record 2,429 yards from scrimmage , eclipsing Barry Sanders 's record of 2,358 yards set in 1997 ( Faulk 's mark has since been broken by Chris Johnson in 2009 ) .
With 1,381 yards rushing ( 5.5 yards - per - carry average ) , 1,048 receiving yards , and scoring 12 touchdowns , Faulk joined Roger Craig as the only men to total 1,000 + yards in each category in a season .
He also broke the NFL season record for most receiving yards by a running back , previously held by Lionel James .
The Rams eventually went on to win Super Bowl XXXIV .
In the game , Faulk was contained on the ground by Tennessee Titans head coach Jeff Fisher 's defensive scheme , limiting him to just 17 rushing yards .
This was perhaps due to the Titans ' inability to stop the Rams ' passing game , of which Faulk was a major part , recording 5 receptions for 90 yards .
His 90 receiving yards were the second highest total by a running back in Super Bowl history .
At the end of the season , he received the NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award and was a starter for the NFC squad in the 1999 Pro Bowl .
The following year , Faulk became the first running back in NFL history to lead his team in receptions five separate seasons ( three in Indianapolis and twice in St. Louis ) .
In addition , he was the NFL MVP and again the Offensive Player of the Year in 2000 .
He had 1,359 yards rushing in fourteen games and set a new NFL record with 26 total touchdowns , ( a record that would soon be broken by Priest Holmes and then later by Shaun Alexander and LaDainian Tomlinson ) , despite missing two games due to injury .
He also averaged 5 + yards per carry again , this time with 5.4 .
The Rams , however were not able to replicate the record they had the year prior .
Even with the offense scoring the most points and yards during " The Greatest Show on Turf " era , the defense gave up 470 points .
The Rams returned to the Super Bowl the next year as their defense returned to form , allowing only 273 points , and the offense once again scored over 500 points , with 503 .
Faulk had another excellent season , rushing 260 times for a career - high 1,382 yards ( 5.3 yards per carry ) , and catching 83 passes for 765 yards , for an NFC - leading total of 2,147 yards from scrimmage ( second in the NFL only to Priest Holmes , who totaled 2,169 yards ) and scoring 21 touchdowns despite once again missing 2 games to injuries .
Faulk won , for the third year in a row , the NFL 's Offensive Player of the Year award , but finished second in a close vote to teammate Kurt Warner in the MVP vote .
These years would be the climax of Faulk 's career .
Faulk 's injuries and age would soon catch up to him ; 2001 was the last of his 1,000-yard rushing seasons , and though he was still employed as the Rams ' primary running back following the 2001 season , he was no longer the player he had been in his prime , despite remaining a respected and effective player .
On July 29 , 2002 , Faulk signed a new seven - year , $ 43.95 million contract with the Rams .
Faulk was about to enter the fourth year of his 1999 contract .
In this new contract Faulk received a $ 10.7 million signing bonus .
In the 2002 season the Rams struggled and finished the year at 7 - 9 .
Faulk played in 14 games and started 10 and ended with 953 yards and 80 receptions .
The following season , he played in and started 11 games , finishing with 818 yards and 45 receptions as the Rams rebounded with a 12 - 4 record .
In 2004 , Faulk split time with rookie Steven Jackson and played in 14 games and rushing for 774 yards .
In February 2005 , Faulk agreed to a restructured contract to reduce his contract cap number .
He was scheduled to make about $ 7.5 million in 2005 .
In the new contract received a total of $ 6 million in the next two seasons and a $ 2 million signing bonus was included .
The 2005 season was Faulk 's last in the NFL .
He rushed for only 292 yards on 65 carries and caught 44 passes for 291 yards and one touchdown .
This marked the only time in his career where he did not have a rushing touchdown .
On July 21 , the Rams announced that Faulk would undergo reconstructive knee surgery and miss the entire 2006 NFL season .
During the season Faulk served as an analyst for the NFL Network 's NFL Total Access .
During an NBC Sunday Night Football halftime show , Faulk was asked by one of the announcers , "
So are you retired or not ? "
Faulk said that he was still a Ram , and would be a Ram for the rest of his life .
He then said that if the Rams would have him back , he would play next year , as he was able to run full speed on his re - built knees , however on March 26 , 2007 , Faulk announced his retirement from football .
On November 29 , 2007 , the Rams announced that they would be retiring Faulk 's number .
The ceremony was during halftime of the Thursday night game against the Pittsburgh Steelers on December 20 , 2007 .
In 2010 on " NFL Network presents The Top 100 : NFL 's Greatest Players " , Faulk was voted the number 70 player of all time .
In 2011 , Faulk 's first year of eligibility , he was elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame .
As a running back , he placed first in receiving yards ( 6,875 ) , second in pass receptions ( 767 ) , second in receiving touchdowns ( 36 ) , third in yards from scrimmage ( 19,154 ) , and tenth in rushing yards ( 12,280 ) .
