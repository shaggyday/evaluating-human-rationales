THE O.C.
The O.C. is an American teen drama television series created by Josh Schwartz that originally aired on the Fox network in the United States from August 5 , 2003 , to February 22 , 2007 , running a total of four seasons .
"
O.C. " is an abbreviation of Orange County , the location in California in which the series is set .
The series centers on Ryan Atwood , a troubled but gifted young man from a broken home who is adopted by the wealthy and philanthropic Sandy and Kirsten Cohen .
Ryan and his foster brother Seth , a socially awkward yet quick - witted teenager , deal with life as outsiders in the high - class world of Newport Beach .
Ryan and Seth spend much time navigating their relationships with girl - next - door Marissa Cooper , Seth 's childhood crush Summer Roberts , and the fast - talking loner Taylor Townsend .
Storylines deal with the culture clash between the idealistic Cohen family and the shallow , materialistic , and closed - minded community in which they reside .
The series includes elements of postmodernism , and functions as a mixture of melodrama and comedy .
The series premiered with high ratings and was one of the most popular new dramas of the 2003â€“2004 television season .
It was widely referred to as a pop cultural phenomenon and received mostly positive reception from critics .
However , ratings declined as the show went on .
The low ratings led to its cancellation in early 2007 , even after an online petition that gained over 700,000 signatures .
The O.C. has been broadcast in more than fifty countries worldwide .
The series has also been released on DVD , as well as on iTunes .
PLOT Section::::Plot .
Season 1 focuses on Ryan Atwood 's arrival in Newport Beach to live with Sandy and Kirsten Cohen , who take him in after his mother kicks him out .
A major theme of the first season is the culture shock Ryan feels as he adjusts from a life of domestic abuse and poverty to living in a superficial high - class society .
He quickly befriends and bonds with Seth Cohen , and begins to have a romantic relationship with Marissa Cooper .
Although coming from very different backgrounds , Ryan soon discovers that he deals with similar issues to his new peers , such as self - identity conflict and familial alienation .
The relationship between Ryan and Marissa flourishes when he supports her through her parents ' divorce .
As the show progresses , Ryan takes a very protective role over Marissa , showing Ryan to be a much more stable , controlled person than originally portrayed .
Other storylines include Seth 's development from a friendless loner to having two romantic choices in Summer and Anna , as well as the arrivals of Oliver Trask , a troubled teen who befriends Marissa during their coinciding therapy sessions , and Theresa Diaz , Ryan 's close friend and former love interest from his hometown of Chino .
Meanwhile , Sandy Cohen frequently comes into conflict with Caleb Nichol , Kirsten 's father and a wealthy industrialist who is said to " basically own Newport . "
The second season of The O.C. continues to follow the tumultuous romantic relationships between Ryan and Marissa , Seth and Summer , and Sandy and Kirsten .
Josh Schwartz , the show 's creator , stated that in Season 2 , the show would " no longer be about Ryan 's past ; now it 's going to be about Ryan 's future , " and that this season would " slow down the storytelling a little bit ... and evolve the characters .
" For example , the story closely follows Ryan in his advanced physics class , where tension is created between him and another student , Lindsay , who presumes that Ryan will be useless as a lab partner , who thus prevents him from contributing to the work that must be submitted .
Ryan 's character begins to grow when he stands up to Lindsay and convinces her to allow him to contribute , forcing them to work together to complete the assignment .
They later become involved romantically , creating extreme complications and relational shifts amongst the now " Cooper - Nichol " family .
The Bait Shop becomes a prominent social destination for the teenage characters .
A number of recurring characters are introduced , such as D.J. , Lindsay Gardner , Zach Stevens , and Alex Kelly , with whom the main characters form a variety of relationships .
Ryan 's brother , Trey Atwood , gets out of jail and threatens to bring Ryan 's old life into his new one .
Sandy and Kirsten also face new conflicts after drifting apart during the summer .
Season 2 ends with Marissa shooting Trey after Ryan confronts him for attempting to sexually assault Marissa .
Season 3 creates many dynamic changes with regards to relationships and power within the characters ' society .
Firstly , Marissa is expelled from the Harbor School .
The Cooper family , left with little money , is forced to move into a trailer park .
Julie Cooper - Nichol , once one of the richest women in all of Newport , struggles to put food on the table for her daughters .
Marissa 's life begins to spiral out of control , as she struggles with alcohol and drug abuse , as well as dealing with the loss of her close friend Johnny .
Similarly , Kirsten confronts her alcohol addiction and eventually leaves rehab , only to encounter more problems when she begins business with a con artist .
The other characters look towards college , with Seth and Summer competing for a spot at Brown University .
Sandy 's moral compass becomes imperiled when a past love interest makes her way back into his life , and he takes over Caleb 's old position as head of The Newport Group , pursuing a project to establish more low - income housing in Newport .
Ryan also attempts to resolve his individual relationships with his mother , and with his childhood friend Theresa Diaz .
He also pursues the idea of a post - secondary education , with encouragement from both Sandy and Kirsten to visit Berkeley .
Ryan 's life is quickly put on hold when , in the season 3 finale , Ryan decides to drive Marissa to the airport , and they are run off the road by Kevin Volchok , Marissa 's most recent love affair gone wrong .
In the last few minutes of the episode , Ryan pulls Marissa out from the burning car , only to watch her die in his arms .
The fourth and final season begins five months after Marissa 's death in the car accident .
Ryan starts the season in isolation as a broken , grieving man , seeking revenge on Volchok .
With the help of Julie , both she and Ryan are able to track Volchok down in Mexico , and turn him into federal officials .
The continued love of the Cohen family and the company of the eccentric Taylor Townsend guide him back to the light .
Meanwhile , Seth and Summer face the problems of a long distance relationship as Summer leaves to attend college .
The first half of the season focuses on the characters accepting the reality of Marissa 's death .
The second half focuses on the characters " finding themselves " while facing myriad identity crises .
This final season contains multiple surprises , such as a new addition to the Cohen family , a visit to an alternate universe in which Sandy becomes mayor , and a natural disaster that leaves Newport devastated .

Julie was obviously the original housewife . "
Melinda went on to commend the character 's " incredible arc , " saying that Julie started as " this woman who was so superficial

When asked by the Tribune about the character , Dale said , " " The thing that 's lovely about this character is that there 's so much to do with him .

I loved that about her .
I loved that she made no apologies for who she was even though she was n't what all the magazines said was OK .

My character went to boarding school and when they decided to bring her back , they actually re - auditioned me to bring her back .
But I did n't go through puberty until late ( ... )
So , there was no weirdness when Willa Holland got it because she was so obviously right for the role ...
and I was so obviously not [ laughs ] .
" In the series , Willa Holland 's character dates a character played by the popular music star Chris Brown in the 4th season of the show .
PRODUCTION CONCEPTION Section::::Production .
Section::::Conception .
In 2002 , creator Josh Schwartz met with Joseph " McG " McGinty Nichol and Stephanie Savage of production company Wonderland Sound and Vision .
They told Schwartz they wanted to create a television show based in McG 's hometown of Newport Beach , Orange County , California .
Savage suggested producing a police or extreme sports 21 Jump Street - style show , but Schwartz knew little about the genre .
Having had experiences with people from Newport Beach during his time at the University of Southern California , Schwartz came back to them with his own characters .
The show was pitched to Fox in August 2002 .
Fox targeted a summer launch for the show , and Doug Liman was brought in to direct the premiere after McG withdrew due to his scheduling conflicts with .
The show was confirmed for the 2003â€“2004 schedule in May , and an August 5 , 2003 broadcast date was selected in June .
Schwartz said that inspiration for the show came from being a fan of Larry Sanders , Cameron Crowe and other " quirky character - driven shows like Freaks and Geeks , Undeclared , and My So - Called Life " .
Schwartz went to college at the University of Southern California School of Cinema - Television , and later said that The O.C. was " very much based on sort of the experiences I had when I was in college " as a " Jewish kid from the East Coast ... surrounded by all these kids from Newport Beach who were water - polo players , and these very blonde girls who only wanted to date them .
I felt very much like an outsider . "
Although Orange County residents criticized the show 's title , stating that people did not call the county by the phrase , Schwartz claims that USC students did say that they were from " The O.C.
" He also stated that Cohen family in season one resembles his own family life , adding that " The dynamic between Sandy and Seth is very much based on me and my dad . "
Schwartz reasoned that , "
As much as our audience enjoys living vicariously in this wealthy world , I think the true wish fulfillment comes from wishing that they had a family like the Cohens â€” where the parents could be that cool and that grounded and that loving , but also real parents . "
Schwartz said that he wrote the highly regarded Pilot episode in his boxer shorts .
" I had no idea what would come of it and there was just that purity to it . "
The script for the Pilot attracted most of the regular cast to the project , including film star Peter Gallagher , who said of the Pilot , " In that recently post-9/11 America , I read this script and thought it was astounding .
I thought it was exactly the right story to be telling at that point in time .
It was about a family living in a not very embracing community , one that does n't necessarily share all their values .
[ .. ] they do n't lose their sense of humor or their inclination to help .
They still open their arms and embrace this outsider kid .
And I thought that was powerful in an era with a kind of xenophobia , a kind of looking - over - your - shoulder and getting small and angry , sort of creeping into the PATRIOT Act - fueled environment .
This espoused a kind of America ...
It just felt right .
And it had a sense of humor . "
FILMING LOCATIONS
Section::::Filming locations .
Although the show is set in Newport Beach , financial penalties imposed for filming outside the studio zone meant much of the show was filmed in the Manhattan Beach , Los Angeles County region .
Many of the beach scenes were also filmed in Hermosa Beach , Redondo Beach and Torrance .
Sites in Los Angeles County were used for many different on - screen locations , which include Ryan 's hometown of Chino , Luke 's father 's Portland home , Johnny 's father 's Indio office and Tijuana .
For the first episode , " Premiere " , the Cohen family home was shot on location in Malibu .
A mock pool house was built for use in the pilot , and taken down after filming completed .
The Cohens ' home was recreated on a soundstage at Raleigh Studios in Manhattan Beach for filming during the rest of the series ; the pool was only 4-feet deep meaning that the cast had to act on their knees .
External shots of the original house remained in use throughout the show .
The pilot was shot on 35 mm film stock , while subsequent episodes used digitally post - processed 16 mm in order to reduce the cost of production .
The Harbor School is the local school that the show 's adolescents attend .
Based on Newport 's Newport Harbor High School , which executive producer McG attended , the filming location was Mount St. Mary 's College , a private woman 's college in Brentwood , Los Angeles .
The University of California , Los Angeles was the location used to represent Berkeley , and the University of Southern California was used to represent Brown University .
The FAA First Federal Credit Union building in Hawthorne was used to depict the Newport Group in season two .
Wayfarers Chapel in Rancho Palos Verdes was used three times on the show â€” twice for a wedding and once for a funeral .
The Cohen 's original home in Berkeley , which they return to in " The End 's Not Near
, It 's Here " , was shot in South Pasadena .
The restaurant dubbed the Crab Shack on the show is actually local landmark
The Crab Cooker .
Julie refers to the restaurant in a Season 3 episode by its real - life name .
Scenes from the show were also shot at the landmark Wattles Mansion located in Hollywood .
THE COHEN HOME Section::::The Cohen home .
The Cohen household is a fictitious " McMansion " built by Caleb Nichol and The Newport Group .
The house is based off two homes located in Malibu , California .
The exterior shots of the front of the home and the driveway were filmed from a home on Ocean Breeze Drive in Malibu , California , built in 2002 .
This was filmed multiple times and used continuously for all four seasons .
The interior , backyard , and infinity pool were filmed for the pilot episode in another home down the street also in Malibu .
The pool house was built for the pilot episode .
After the show got picked up to reduce production costs the interior , backyard , and pool house was rebuilt at Raleigh Studios in Manhattan Beach , CA .
During some early episodes in season 2 , the Cohens were doing some extensive remodeling ; this was probably written in because the new set did not accurately recreate the original home in Malibu .
The kitchen countertop changed from a dark grey granite to a light beige marble countertop .
The sink in the island countertop switches to the other side and the backsplash tile changes .
During the pilot episode Ryan walked out of the pool house to look at the ocean view .
Past the property line there were houses , streets , cars , and land between the house and the ocean .
After the set was created , there was just an ocean and sky backdrop as if the house were sitting on a cliff ; also artificial grass and studio lighting looked less realistic than in the pilot episode .
MUSIC Section::::Music .
Alexandra Patsavas , who had previously worked on shows including Roswell and CarnivÃ le , was appointed as music supervisor on The O.C ..
Patsavas worked alongside creator Josh Schwartz , in selecting the music to be used .
Schwartz said that he had " always intended that music be a character on the show " The O.C. made indie rock a " main focus of the series " and also its marketing plan , releasing six soundtracks throughout the series .
In the second season , a fictional new night club and concert venue , called The Bait Shop , was introduced .
Bands including The Walkmen , The Killers , Modest Mouse , The Thrills , Rachael Yamagata , Death Cab for Cutie and The Subways all made guest appearances on the show performing at the venue .
In addition to having guest artists perform on the show , it also premiered many new music singles from artists including the Beastie Boys , U2 , Beck , Coldplay , Gwen Stefani , and The Shins .
Many bands gained exposure through the show , which caused an increase in sales of their music .
Rooney , who were the first band to guest appear on the show , experienced a " 200 percent increase in sales " after their appearance .
Even artists who just had their songs featured benefited : Imogen Heap became " a household name stateside , " and Youth Group , who recorded a song specifically for the show , had " more than 5,000 iTunes downloads [ of that track ] in its first week " following it being played .
However , not all bands were keen to feature on the show .
Clap
Your Hands Say
Yeah were asked to perform , but they turned it down because they were worried that it could diminish their credibility .
Some fans and critics echoed that sentiment by stating that such appearances and mass marketing techniques are creating sell - outs .
Generally the music was well received .
Ben Spier from Entertainment Weekly described the show as a " mixtaper 's dream " and Rolling Stone commented that the soundtrack was the reason people kept watching the show .
However , Karyn L. Barr from Entertainment Weekly stated that using acts like U2 on a show that dedicated time to indie bands was " selling out . "
Noah Davis of PopMatters.com criticized the show for neglecting plotlines and replacing them with " the gang 's countless trips to the Bait Shop . "
THEMES Section::::Themes .
The series touches on themes such as inter - generational conflict , social class , social mobility , social alienation , sexual performance anxiety , hope , loneliness , virginity , emotional insecurity , environmentalism , alcoholism , drug addiction , gambling addiction , mental illness , homophobia , bisexuality , May â€“ December romances , teen pregnancy , political activism , and eventually death and the acceptance of loss .
These topics are examined through both lighthearted comedy and heightened operatic drama .
CHRISMUKKAH Section::::Chrismukkah .
Within the series , Seth Cohen has a Jewish father and a Protestant ( Presbyterian ) mother .
As a way to merge the two faiths , Seth claims to have " created Chrismukkah " when he was six years old .
The series included annual Chrismukkah episodes for every season of its run .
Particulars of when exactly the holiday was celebrated were not given ; Seth simply said in the first season 's Chrismukkah episode that it was " eight days of presents , followed by one day of many presents .
" Chrismukkah later received mention in the television series Grey 's Anatomy .
In December 2011 the pop - culture website The A.V. Club reviewed all four Chrismukkah episodes for its " TV Club Advent Calendar .
" The writer noted , " When thinking back on holiday specials of yore for this project , the first thing that popped into my head was n't nostalgia for my Rankin / Bass- and Chuck Jones - filled youth .
Instead , I immediately focused on a much more recent obsession : Chrismukkah .
Created by The O.C.s Seth Cohen ...
" The reviewer continued , saying that " A thread of underlying sadness unites all four Chrismukkah episodes , but it 's a sadness that begs to be redeemed by the end of the hour .
Chrismukkah is really about traditional Christmas togetherness and your standard happy ending ; it 's the everyday miracle of people coming together to create something magical . "
META - FICTIONAL HUMOR
Section::::Meta - fictional humor .
Several episodes feature a fictional show - within - the - show called The Valley , an in - show equivalent to The O.C.
The Valley , like The O.C. , has a fictional reality TV counterpart , Sherman Oaks :
The Real Valley , which causes Seth to ask , " Why watch the plight of fictional characters when you can watch real people in contrived situations ? "
Season 2 also focuses on the creation of a fictional comic book called Atomic County , written by Seth Cohen , that is used for similar self - deprecating purposes .
The Valley and Atomic County are used throughout the series to comment on aspects of the show itself , such as message board criticism of the show 's reliance on love triangles , the trope of mid - twenties actors portraying teenagers , and the inability of the series to be renewed for another season .
In addition , several of the characters talk as if they are aware that they are in a television series .
One episode in the second season finds Seth commenting that " we tried some new things , " but that " last year was just better , " echoing response from fans that the second season was inferior to the first .
USA Today remarked that The O.C. 's " undertone of sarcasm and self - parody ' was one of the aspects of the series that made it compelling .
Writer Ken Barnes opined that The O.C. took " meta - TV " to its " sublime peak " with The Valley .
He continued , saying that the " device allowed producers and writers to have fun mocking critical and public perceptions of The OC , its supposed soap - operatic excesses and pop - culture obsessions .
In a book written by Alan Sepinwall that examined the series , Sepinwall noted that " Schwartz spends enough of his day trolling message boards to know exactly what fans are complaining about and which references to other shows and movies they 've caught , and he incorporates it into his scripts . "
An entire chapter of the book is devoted to perceived self - mockery within the series , with much attention given to the episode " The L.A. " from Season One .
Producer Allan Heinberg said that many instances of meta - commentary had to be cut if the network or Schwartz felt they had gone too far , saying that " Sandy at one point had a speech about the Golden Globes that we felt was maybe a little inside . "
Schwartz similarly declined a request to have The O.C. actors portray themselves on Arrested Development , another FOX show set in Orange County .

RECEPTION CRITICAL RECEPTION Section::::Reception .
Section::::Critical reception .
Season one of The O.C. received generally positive reviews from critics and is frequently regarded as the best season .
Upon the show 's premiere , Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of MSNBC described Ryan and Seth 's friendship as " the most promising plot " .
The New York Times noted that " Mr. Schwartz pulled it off , sneaking a truly smart show past the gatekeepers in the guise of something commercial and trashy and fun .
"
The reviewer also praised how the show " steered clear of both Aaron Spelling - style camp and the soggy earnestness that often characterises teen drama " and praised the integration of the adult cast into the plotlines .
IGN called it " far more engaging and interesting " than its predecessors in the teen genre .
The reviewer pointed to the show 's sense of humor and respect for its audience , praising the series as " very funny " and " well - acted " , while referring to Mischa Barton as the weak link .
Time Magazine critic James Poniewozik was fond of the premiere episode , saying that the show " looks to have enough heart , talent and wit to generate a few seasons ' worth of luxurious suds .
As Ryan would say , in the teen - soap business , being 100 % original does n't make you smart .
Delivering a formula with so much style and believability that it feels new again â€” that does . "
Despite much positive reception , the first season was not without some criticism .
San Jose Mercury News criticized the plot and the casting , saying that " the storylines usually involve the obligatory three - episode - arc drug problems or lost virginity with dialogue designed to keep a dog up to speed , " and that " Whoever at FOX thought Benjamin McKenzie could pass for anything younger than 25 should be fired . "
The second season was widely regarded as inferior to the first , but still received generally positive reception .
IGN noted that Season 2 contains some of the best moments of the series , and praised the bisexual romance between Alex and Marissa .
It was said to have " managed to surpass its ratings ploy outer trappings to actually work as one of the better Marissa plotlines , at least initially , by doing a solid job of portraying her
" I 've never done this before ...
" confusion and excitement . "
Another review praised episodes " The Chrismukkah That Almost Was n't " and " The Rainy Day Woman " as standout quality hours of the series , and praised the storyline that focused on Sandy and Kirsten 's marriage .
In contrast to the first two , Season 3 of the series was met with mostly negative reception .
After the eventual cancellation of the show , Schwartz admitted that " the whole first half of the third season was a total mess . "
IGN faulted a season which , in their opinion , had " far too much time and too many episodes spent with the less than beloved character Johnny . "
IGN also noted that " Kirsten and Sandy both suffered from unsatisfying stories , " and that the departure of character Caleb Nichol had been a mistake " as he had been a great character to bounce off both of the elder Cohens . "
In September 2007 , Schwartz admitted in an interview for New York that the show " went down the wrong road " with Johnny .
The season did , however , receive some praise .
The new character Taylor Townsend was stated as being " played to perfection by Autumn Reeser " and her character was described as " one of the greatest elements of The
O.C. " Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk described the storylines as " very intelligent and also incorporate a great deal of humor to keep your interest . "
While looking back on the series in an interview for the complete series box - set , Schwartz explained that " somewhere around Season 3 , for reasons too numerous to discuss , I lost focus .
The network was n't really supporting the show .
" Schwartz went on to say that Season 3 was probably " the most important season , because it 's where I learned the most .
About television , about myself as a writer , about discipline and trying to hold onto your focus even if you 're hearing a lot of opinions or being forced to add things creatively that you do n't agree with .
And I do n't think Season 4 would have been as fun or as adventurous or as weird and zany and ultimately emotional if it were n't for that experience . "
The final season is generally regarded by fans and critics as a return to form for the series .
Varietys Josef Adalian said that " [ the show ] is once again in great creative shape . "
He added that " the scripts are snappy , the plots make sense , the acting 's solid , [ and ] the music is appropriately indie " but criticized Fox for " throwing away " the show by giving it the Thursday 9:00 p.m. timeslot .
Buddytv.com praised the season premiere , saying " this episode is the best OC episode since the show 's first season .
The absence of Mischa Barton character of Marissa Cooper is the best thing that 's happened to The OC in a long time .
The cast is now exceptional from top to bottom and the show is , at least in the first episode , much darker in tone than the first three seasons .
This is a good sign . "
Later in the season , Buddytv.com lamented that " The OC is winding down , in all likelihood , and it 's a shame .
The show is hitting its creative stride just now , in its fourth season , and no one cares . "
Critic Alan Sepinwall said of the premiere , " Damn .
That was ... not bad .
No , better than that .
That was good .
Confident , in character , funny on occasion ( any scene with Che ) , genuinely touching at others ( the comic book store intervention ) , really the most like itself the show has felt in a long time , maybe even going back to season one .
"
In a review of a later episode , Sepinwall related that Season 4 was a " resurgent season " and that " every " O.C. " episode review just turns into a list of things I liked . "
Belinda Acosta of The Austin Chronicle agreed , praising the show 's " new energy " and its ability to successfully cover " the transition between high school and college that other series have stumbled over . "
Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker commented that the fourth season was " a succession of terrific subplots " and praised new main cast member Taylor " as a fine , funny love interest for Ryan . "
Greg Elwell of DVD Talk described Bullit as " the breakout character of the season " but commented that the season 's " dark opening ( ... ) did n't do much to keep viewers around .
"
IGN 's Eric Goldman was also critical , saying that " as amusing as Che was , his inclusion into some later episodes gets a bit tired . "
Goldman also commented that " the second half of Season 4 was n't quite as solid as the first [ half ] " ; however , he added that while the fourth season had to prove itself again as an enjoyable watch " Josh Schwartz rose to this challenge ( ... ) once again creating a show that was witty and self - aware . " U.S. TELEVISION RATINGS Section::::U.S. television ratings .
The pilot episode attracted 7.46 million viewers in the United States , came second in its time slot behind the season finale of Last Comic Standing , and was the highest rated show of the night in the 12â€“17-year - old demographic .

It attracted 12.72 million viewers , and was the lead - out to American Idol , which attracted 29.43 million viewers that week .
The O.C. was the highest - rated new drama of the 2003â€“2004 season among adults aged 18 to 34 , averaging a total of 9.7 million viewers .
For the second season , the show moved to an " ultra - competitive Thursday " timeslot against the likes of Survivor , Joey and Will & Grace .
This is often cited as a cause of The O.C.s decline in popularity .
The move improved Fox 's performance at the new time slot , but lost the show viewers , as average viewing figures decreased thirty percent from the previous season to 7 million .
For the third season , average viewing figures decreased a further twenty percent from the previous season to 5.6 million .
The Thursday 9.00 pm timeslot placed the show against two other very popular shows , and Grey 's Anatomy .
The fourth season premiered in November 2006 with very little promotion or advertisements from FOX , and was once again in the Thursday timeslot .
The premiere episode attracted 3.4 million viewers , which was a series low .
For the series finale , 6.7 million viewers tuned in .
This was 76 percent more than the season average of 4.6 million viewers . !
