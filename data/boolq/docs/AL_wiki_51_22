HISTORY Section::::History .
According to historical legends , the San Luis Rey Mission flocks were robbed by a small band of Native Americans in the late 18th century .
Fleeing the Spanish troops , the Native Americans escaped to the hills .
While pursuing the Native Americans , in 1797 the Spaniards came upon a fertile valley , which was named Los Vallecitos de San Marcos ( Little Valleys of Saint Mark ) to honor the day of discovery : April 25 , St. Mark 's Day .
On April 22 , 1840 , Governor Juan B. Alvarado granted Rancho Vallecitos de San Marcos to his relative , Jose María Alvarado .
Jose Alvarado was killed at the Pauma Massacre in 1846 , and the land was left to his wife ; she then sold the land to Lorenzo Soto .
In the late 1850s , Soto sold part of his land to Cave Couts , and his family was soon raising livestock .
Although Cave Couts owned the land , Major Gustavus French Merriam from Topeka , Kansas , made the first permanent settlement .
Merriam homesteaded in the north Twin Oaks Valley and began wine and honey production .
After Major Merriam 's settlement , German and Dutch immigrants began moving into the area in the early 1880s .
In 1883 , a few miles south of the settlement , John H. Barham ( for whom the present - day Barham Drive is named ) founded the first town in the area , originally situated on the southeast corner of what are now Rancho Santa Fe Road and San Marcos Boulevard .
By 1884 , the town of Barham had a post office , blacksmith , feed store and weekly newspaper .
In 1887 , the San Marcos Land Company bought almost all of the San Marcos land formerly owned by the Couts family and promptly divided the land into tracts .
Soon the beautiful hills began attracting home - seekers .
The original town of San Marcos was about a mile north of Barham , at the intersection of what is now Grand Avenue and Rancho Santa Fe Road .
In 1887 , the Santa Fe Railroad announced that it was going to lay tracks going through the valley , but to the disappointment of the citizens , the tracks were laid one mile ( 1.6 km ) from the center of the town .
By 1896 , San Marcos was a community with its own stores , post office , blacksmith , and railroad depot .
The first school in the area , which was started in Barham in 1886 , had been moved to San Marcos three years later , as Barham was fading due to its distance from the railroad .
To prevent San Marcos from suffering a similar fate , in 1903 the people of the town picked up their homes and moved a couple miles east along the railroad tracks to what now are Mission Road and Pico Avenue .
By 1905 , the town had every convenience , including rural mail delivery and telephone service .
Later that same year , the Richland School ( now a wedding chapel on Woodland Avenue ) was built , becoming the second school in San Marcos .
The main business in San Marcos in the 19th and early 20th centuries was farming .
In the mid-20th century , dairies and poultry production became a big part of the business in the town .
San Marcos experienced a period of growth from 1956 onward , when the first water from the Colorado River arrived .
Several small businesses were founded and the population rapidly increased to 2,500 .
San Marcos became an incorporated city on January 28 , 1963 .
In the 1970s , San Marcos was flourishing as the third fastest - growing city in the state , and had a population of 17,479 by 1980 .
The population continued to boom over the next two decades , surpassing 30,000 in 1990 and nearing 85,000 by 2010 .
