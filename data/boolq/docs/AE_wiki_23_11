SUSHI Sushi is traditionally made with medium - grain white rice , though it can be prepared with brown rice .
It is often prepared with seafood , such as calamari , eel , or imitation crab meat .
Many others are vegetarian .
Sushi is often served with pickled ginger ( gari ) , wasabi , and soy sauce .
Daikon radish is popular as a garnish .
Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi , a related Japanese dish consisting of thinly sliced raw fish , or occasionally meat , and an optional serving of rice .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish , known today as narezushi ( – " salted fish " ) , stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time .
The lacto - fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling ; the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish .
This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers .
The term sushi comes from an antiquated grammatical form no longer used in other contexts , and literally means " sour - tasting " ; the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste .
Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty , notably as funa - zushi from Shiga Prefecture .
Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period ( 1336–1573 ) for the sake of enhancing both taste and preservation .
In addition to increasing the sourness of the rice , the vinegar significantly increased the dish 's longevity , causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned .
The primitive sushi would be further developed in Osaka , where over several centuries it became oshi - zushi or " hako - zushi " ; in this preparation , the seafood and rice were pressed into shape with wooden ( typically bamboo ) molds .
It was not until the Edo period ( 1603 - 1868 ) that fresh fish was served over vinegared rice and nori .
The particular style of today 's nigirizushi became popular in Edo ( contemporary Tokyo ) in the 1820s or 1830s .
One common story of nigirizushi 's origins is of the chef
Hanaya
Yohei ( 1799 - 1858 ) , who invented or perfected the technique in 1824 at his shop in Ryōgoku .
The dish was originally termed Edomae zushi as it used freshly caught fish from the Edo - mae ( Edo or Tokyo Bay ) ; the term Edomae nigirizushi is still used today as a by - word for quality sushi , regardless of its ingredients ' origins .
The Oxford English Dictionary mistakenly notes the earliest written mention of sushi in English in an 1893 book , A Japanese Interior , where it mentions sushi as " a roll of cold rice with fish , sea - weed , or some other flavoring " .
However , there is an earlier mention of sushi in James Hepburn 's Japanese - English dictionary from 1873 , and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the journal Notes and Queries .
TYPES Section::::Types .
The common ingredient in all types of sushi is vinegared sushi rice .
Fillings , toppings , condiments , and preparation vary widely .
Note that due to rendaku consonant mutation , sushi is spelled with zu instead of su whenever a prefix is attached , such as in nigirizushi for instance .
CHIRASHIZUSHI Section::::Chirashizushi .
Chirashizushi ( , " scattered sushi " , also referred to as barazushi ) serves the rice in a bowl and tops it with a variety of raw fish and vegetable garnishes .
It is commonly eaten because it is filling , fast and easy to make .
It is eaten annually on Hinamatsuri in March .
* Edomae chirashizushi ( Edo - style scattered sushi ) is served with uncooked ingredients in an artful arrangement .
* Gomokuzushi ( Kansai - style sushi ) consists of cooked or uncooked ingredients mixed in the body of rice .
* Sake - zushi ( Kyushu - style sushi ) uses rice wine over vinegar in preparing the rice , and is topped with shrimp , sea bream , octopus , shiitake mushrooms , bamboo shoots and shredded omelette .
INARIZUSHI
Section::::Inarizushi .
Inarizushi ( ) is a pouch of fried tofu typically filled with sushi rice alone .
Tales tell that inarizushi is named after the Shinto god Inari .
Foxes , messengers of Inari , are believed to have a fondness for fried tofu , and an Inari - zushi roll has pointed corners that resemble fox ears .
Regional variations include pouches made of a thin omelette ( , fukusa - zushi , or , chakin - zushi ) instead of tofu .
It should not be confused with inari maki , which is a roll filled with flavored fried tofu .
Cone sushi is a variant of inarizushi originating in Hawaii that may include green beans , carrots , or gobo along with rice , wrapped in a triangular aburage piece .
It is often sold in okazu - ya ( Japanese delis ) and as a component of bento boxes .
MAKIZUSHI Section::::Makizushi .
Makizushi ( , " rolled sushi " ) , norimaki ( , " Nori roll " ) or makimono ( , " variety of rolls " ) is a cylindrical piece , formed with the help of a bamboo mat known as a makisu ( ) .
Makizushi is generally wrapped in nori ( seaweed ) , but is occasionally wrapped in a thin omelette , soy paper , cucumber , or shiso ( perilla ) leaves .
Makizushi is usually cut into six or eight pieces , which constitutes a single roll order .
Below are some common types of makizushi , but many other kinds exist .
Futomaki ( , " thick , large or fat rolls " ) is a large cylindrical piece , usually with nori on the outside .
A typical futomaki is five to six centimeters ( 2–2.5 in ) in diameter .
They are often made with two , three , or more fillings that are chosen for their complementary tastes and colors .
During the evening of the Setsubun festival , it is traditional in the Kansai region to eat uncut futomaki in its cylindrical form , where it is called ehō - maki ( , lit .
happy direction rolls ) .
By 2000 the custom had spread to all of Japan .
Futomaki are often vegetarian , and may utilize strips of cucumber , kampyō gourd , takenoko bamboo shoots , or lotus root .
Strips of tamagoyaki omelette , tiny fish roe , chopped tuna , and oboro ( food ) whitefish flakes are typical non - vegetarian fillings .
Traditionally , the rice is lightly seasoned with salt and sesame oil / perilla oil .
Popular protein ingredients are fish cakes , imitation crab meat , eggs , or seasoned beef rib - eye .
Vegetables usually include cucumbers , spinach , carrot and ( pickled radish ) .
After the makizushi has been rolled and sliced , it is typically served with takuan .
Short grain white rice is usually used , although short - grain brown rice , like olive oil on nori , is now becoming more widespread among the health - conscious .
Rarely , sweet rice is mixed in makizushi rice .
Nowadays , the rice in makizushi can be many kinds of black rice , boiled rice and cereals etc .
Besides the common ingredients listed above , some varieties may include cheese , spicy cooked squid , yakiniku , kamaboko , lunch meat , sausage , bacon or spicy tuna .
The nori may be brushed with sesame oil or sprinkled with sesame seeds .
In a variation , sliced pieces of makizushi may be lightly fried with egg coating .
Tamago makizushi ( 玉子巻き寿司 ) is makizushi is rolled out by a thin egg .
Tempura Makizushi ( 天ぷら 巻き寿司 ) or Agezushi ( 揚げ寿司ロール ) is a fried version of the dish .
Hosomaki ( , " thin rolls " ) is a small cylindrical piece , with nori on the outside .
A typical hosomaki has a diameter of about two and a half centimeters ( 1 in ) .
They generally contain only one filling , often tuna , cucumber , kanpyō , thinly sliced carrots , or , more recently ,
avocado .
Kappamaki , ( ) a kind of Hosomaki filled with cucumber , is named after the Japanese legendary water imp fond of cucumbers called the kappa .
Traditionally , kappamaki is consumed to clear the palate between eating raw fish and other kinds of food , so that the flavors of the fish are distinct from the tastes of other foods .
Tekkamaki ( ) is a kind of hosomaki filled with raw tuna .
Although it is believed that the word tekka , meaning " red hot iron " , alludes to the color of the tuna flesh or salmon flesh , it actually originated as a quick snack to eat in gambling dens called tekkaba ( ) , much like the sandwich .
Negitoromaki ( ) is a kind of hosomaki filled with scallion ( negi ) and chopped tuna ( toro ) .
Fatty tuna is often used in this style .
Tsunamayomaki ( ) is a kind of hosomaki filled with canned tuna tossed with mayonnaise .
Temaki ( , " hand roll " ) is a large cone - shaped piece of nori on the outside and the ingredients spilling out the wide end .
A typical temaki is about ten centimeters ( 4 in ) long , and is eaten with fingers because it is too awkward to pick it up with chopsticks .
For optimal taste and texture , temaki must be eaten quickly after being made because the nori cone soon absorbs moisture from the filling and loses its crispness , making it somewhat difficult to bite through .
For this reason , the nori in pre - made or take - out temaki is sealed in plastic film which is removed immediately before eating .
MODERN NAREZUSHI Section::::Modern Narezushi .
Narezushi ( , " matured sushi " ) is a traditional form of fermented sushi .
Skinned and gutted fish are stuffed with salt , placed in a wooden barrel , doused with salt again , then weighed down with a heavy tsukemonoishi ( pickling stone ) .
As days pass , water seeps out and is removed .
After six months , this sushi can be eaten , remaining edible for another six months or more .
The most famous variety of narezushi are the ones offered as a specialty dish of Shiga Prefecture , particularly the funa - zushi made from fish of the crucian carp genus , the authentic version of which calls for the use nigorobuna , a particular locally differentiated variety of wild goldfish endemic to Lake Biwa ) .
NIGIRIZUSHI Section::::Nigirizushi .
Nigirizushi ( , " hand - pressed sushi " ) consists of an oblong mound of sushi rice that the chef presses between the palms of the hands to form an oval - shaped ball , and a topping ( the neta ) draped over the ball .
It is usually served with a bit of wasabi ; neta are typically fish such as salmon , tuna or other seafood .
Certain toppings are typically bound to the rice with a thin strip of nori , most commonly octopus ( tako ) , freshwater eel ( unagi ) , sea eel ( anago ) , squid ( ika ) , and sweet egg ( tamago ) .
One order of a given type of fish typically results in two pieces , while a sushi set ( sampler dish ) may contain only one piece of each topping .
Gunkanmaki ( , " warship roll " ) is a special type of nigirizushi : an oval , hand - formed clump of sushi rice that has a strip of nori wrapped around its perimeter to form a vessel that is filled with some soft , loose or fine - chopped ingredient that requires the confinement of nori such as roe , nattō , oysters , uni ( sea urchin roe ) , corn with mayonnaise , scallops , and quail eggs .
Gunkan - maki was invented at the Ginza Kyubey restaurant in 1941 ; its invention significantly expanded the repertoire of soft toppings used in sushi .
Temarizushi ( , " ball sushi " ) is a sushi made by pressing rice and fish into a ball - shaped form by hand using a plastic wrap .
OSHIZUSHI Section::::Oshizushi .
, also known as , is a pressed sushi from the Kansai region , a favorite and specialty of Osaka .
A block - shaped piece is formed using a wooden mold , called an oshibako .
The chef lines the bottom of the oshibako with the toppings , covers them with sushi rice , and then presses the lid of the mold down to create a compact , rectilinear block .
The block is removed from the mold and then cut into bite - sized pieces .
Particularly famous is ( battera , pressed mackerel sushi ) or ( saba zushi ) .
In oshizushi , all the ingredients are either cooked or cured and raw fish is never used .
WESTERN - STYLE SUSHI Section::::Western - style sushi .
The increasing popularity of sushi around the world has resulted in variations typically found in the Western world , but rarely in Japan ( a notable exception to this is the use of salmon , which was introduced by Bjørn Eirik Olsen , a Norwegian businessman tasked with helping the Norwegian salmon industry sell more fish in the early 1980s ) .
Such creations to suit the Western palate were initially fueled by the invention of the California roll ( a norimaki with crab ( later , imitation crab ) , cucumber , and avocado ) .
A wide variety of popular rolls ( norimaki and uramaki ) has evolved since .
Norway roll is another variant of uramakizushi filled with tamago ( omelette ) , imitation crab and cucumber , rolled with shiso leaf and nori , topped with slices of Norwegian salmon , garnished with lemon and mayonnaise .
URAMAKI
Section::::Uramaki .
Uramaki
( , " inside - out roll " ) is a medium - sized cylindrical piece with two or more fillings , and was developed as a result of the creation of the California roll , as a method originally meant to hide the nori .
Uramaki differs from other makimono because the rice is on the outside and the nori inside .
The filling is in the center surrounded by nori , then a layer of rice , and optionally an outer coating of some other ingredients such as roe or toasted sesame seeds .
It can be made with different fillings , such as tuna , crab meat , avocado , mayonnaise , cucumber or carrots .
Examples of variations include the rainbow roll ( an inside - out topped with thinly sliced maguro , hamachi , ebi , sake and avocado ) and the caterpillar roll ( an inside - out topped with thinly sliced avocado ) .
Also commonly found is the " rock and roll " ( an inside - out roll with barbecued freshwater eel and avocado with toasted sesame seeds on the outside ) .
In Japan , uramaki is an uncommon type of makimono ; because sushi is traditionally eaten by hand in Japan , the outer layer of rice can be quite difficult to handle with fingers .
AMERICAN - STYLE MAKIZUSHI Section::::American - style makizushi .
Futomaki is a more popular variation of sushi within the United States , and comes in variations that take their names from their place of origin .
Other rolls may include a variety of ingredients , including chopped scallops , spicy tuna , beef or chicken teriyaki roll , okra , and assorted vegetables such as cucumber and avocado , and the " tempura roll " , where shrimp tempura is inside the roll or the entire roll is battered and fried tempura - style .
In the Southern United States , many sushi restaurants prepare rolls using crawfish .
Sometimes , rolls are made with brown rice or black rice , which appear in Japanese cuisine as well .
Per Food and Drug Administration regulations , raw fish served in the United States must be frozen prior to serving in order to kill parasites .
Because of this and the relative difficulty of acquiring fresh seafood compared to Japan , raw seafood ( e.g. , sashimi ) is not as prevalent of a component in American - style sushi .
Since rolls are usually made to - order
it is not unusual for the customer to specify the exact ingredients desired ( e.g. salmon roll , cucumber roll , avocado roll , Shrimp / tuna tempura roll , tuna roll , etc . ) .
Though the menu names of dishes often vary by restaurant , some examples include : !

All sushi has a base of specially prepared rice , complemented with other ingredients .
SUSHI - MESHI Section::::Sushi - meshi .
Sushi - meshi ( also known as Su - meshi , shari , or gohan ) is a preparation of white , short - grained , Japanese rice mixed with a dressing consisting of rice vinegar , sugar , salt , and occasionally kombu and sake .
It has to be cooled to room temperature before being used for a filling in a sushi or else it will get too sticky while being seasoned .
Traditionally , the mixing is done with a hangiri , which is a round , flat - bottom wooden tub or barrel , and a wooden paddle ( shamoji ) .
Sushi rice is prepared with short - grain Japanese rice , which has a consistency that differs from long - grain strains such as those from India , Sri Lanka , Bangladesh , Thailand , and Vietnam .
The essential quality is its stickiness or glutinousness , although the type of rice used for sushi is different from glutinous rice .
Freshly harvested rice ( shinmai ) typically contains too much water , and requires extra time to drain the rice cooker after washing .
In some fusion cuisine restaurants , short - grain brown rice and wild rice are also used .
There are regional variations in sushi rice and individual chefs have their individual methods .
Most of the variations are in the rice vinegar dressing :
the Kantō region ( or East Japan ) version of the dressing commonly uses more salt ; in Kansai region ( or West Japan ) , the dressing has more sugar .
NORI Section::::Nori .
The black seaweed wrappers used in makimono are called nori ( 海苔 ) .
Nori is a type of algae , traditionally cultivated in the harbors of Japan .
Originally , algae was scraped from dock pilings , rolled out into thin , edible sheets , and dried in the sun , in a process similar to making rice paper .
Today , the commercial product is farmed , processed , toasted , packaged , and sold in sheets .
The size of a nori sheet influences the size of makimono .
A full - size sheet produces futomaki , and a half produces hosomaki and temaki .
To produce gunkan and some other makimono , an appropriately - sized piece of nori is cut from a whole sheet .
Nori by itself is an edible snack and is available with salt or flavored with teriyaki sauce .
The flavored variety , however , tends to be of lesser quality and is not suitable for sushi .
When making fukusazushi , a paper - thin omelette may replace a sheet of nori as the wrapping .
The omelette is traditionally made on a rectangular omelette pan ( makiyakinabe ) , and used to form the pouch for the rice and fillings .
NETA Section::::Neta .
For culinary , sanitary , and aesthetic reasons , the minimum quality and freshness of fish to be eaten raw must be superior to that of fish which is to be cooked .
Sushi chefs are trained to recognize important attributes , including smell , color , firmness , and freedom from parasites that may go undetected in commercial inspection .
Commonly used fish are tuna ( maguro , shiro - maguro ) , Japanese amberjack , yellowtail ( hamachi ) , snapper ( kurodai ) , mackerel ( saba ) , and salmon ( sake ) .
The most valued sushi ingredient is toro , the fatty cut of the fish .
This comes in a variety of ōtoro ( often from the bluefin species of tuna ) and chūtoro , meaning " middle toro " , implying that it is halfway into the fattiness between toro and the regular cut .
Aburi style refers to nigiri sushi where the fish is partially grilled ( topside ) and partially raw .
Most nigiri sushi will have completely raw neta .
Other seafoods such as squid ( ika ) , eel ( anago and unagi ) , pike conger ( hamo ) , octopus ( tako ) , shrimp ( ebi and amaebi ) , clam ( mirugai , aoyagi and akagai ) , fish roe ( ikura , masago , kazunoko and tobiko ) , sea urchin ( uni ) , crab ( kani ) , and various kinds of shellfish ( abalone , prawn , scallop ) are the most popular seafoods in sushi .
Oysters , however , are less common , as the taste is not thought to go well with the rice .
Kani kama , or imitation crab stick , is commonly substituted for real crab , most notably in California rolls .
Pickled daikon radish ( takuan ) in shinko maki , pickled vegetables ( tsukemono ) , fermented soybeans ( nattō ) in nattō maki , avocado , cucumber in kappa maki , asparagus , yam , pickled ume ( umeboshi ) , gourd ( kanpyō ) , burdock ( gobo ) , and sweet corn ( possibly mixed with mayonnaise ) are also used in sushi .
Tofu and eggs ( in the form of slightly sweet , layered omelette called tamagoyaki and raw quail eggs ride as a gunkan - maki topping ) are common .
CONDIMENTS
Section::::Condiments .
Sushi is commonly eaten with condiments .
Sushi may be dipped in shōyu ( soy sauce ) , and is usually flavored with wasabi , a piquant paste made from the grated stem of the Wasabia japonica plant .
Japanese - style mayonnaise is a common condiment in Japan on salmon , pork and other sushi cuts .
True wasabi has anti - microbial properties and may reduce the risk of food poisoning .
The traditional grating tool for wasabi is a sharkskin grater or samegawa oroshi .
An imitation wasabi ( seiyo - wasabi ) , made from horseradish , mustard powder and green dye is common .
It is found at lower - end kaiten - zushi restaurants , in bento box sushi and at most restaurants outside Japan .
If manufactured in Japan , it may be labelled " Japanese Horseradish " .
Gari ( sweet , pickled ginger ) is eaten in between sushi courses to both cleanse the palate and aid in digestion .
In Japan , green tea ( ocha ) is invariably served together with sushi .
Better sushi restaurants often use a distinctive premium tea known as mecha .
In sushi vocabulary , green tea is known as agari .
Sushi may be garnished with gobo , grated daikon , thinly sliced vegetables , carrots / radishes / cucumbers that have been shaped to look like flowers , real flowers , or seaweed salad .
When closely arranged on a tray , different pieces are often separated by green strips called baran or kiri - zasa ( 切り笹 ) .
These dividers prevent the flavors of neighboring pieces of sushi from mixing and help to achieve an attractive presentation .
Originally , these were cut leaves from the Aspidistra elatior ( 葉蘭 haran ) and Sasa veitchii ( 熊笹 kuma - zasa ) plants , respectively .
Using actual leaves had the added benefit of releasing antimicrobial phytoncides when cut thereby extending the limited shelf life of the sushi .
Sushi bento boxes are a staple of Japanese supermarkets and convenience stores .
As these stores began rising in prominence in the 1960s , the labor - intensive cut leaves were increasingly replaced with green plastic in order to lower costs .
This coincided with the increased prevalence of refrigeration which acted to extend the shelf life of sushi without the need for the cut leaves .
Today the plastic strips are commonly used in sushi bento boxes and to a lesser degree in sushi presentations found in sushi bars and restaurants .
In store - sold or to - go packages of sushi , the plastic leaf strips are often used to prevent the rolls from coming into early or unwanted contact with the ginger and wasabi included with the dish .
NUTRITION Section::::Nutrition .
The main ingredients of traditional Japanese sushi , raw fish and rice , are naturally low in fat , high in protein , carbohydrates ( the rice only ) , vitamins , and minerals , as are gari and nori .
Other vegetables wrapped within the sushi also offer various vitamins and minerals .
Many of the seafood ingredients also contain omega-3 fatty acids , which have a variety of health benefits .
The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish has certain beneficial property , especially on cardiovascular health , natural anti - inflammatory compounds , and play a role in brain function .
Generally sushi is not a particularly fattening food .
However , rice in sushi contains a fair amount of carbohydrates , plus the addition of other ingredients such as mayonnaise added into sushi rolls might increase the caloric content .
Sushi also has a relatively high sodium content , especially contributed from shoyu soy sauce seasoning .
HEALTH RISKS
Section::::Health risks .
Some of the ingredients in sushi can present health risks .
Large marine apex predators such as tuna ( especially bluefin ) can harbor high levels of methylmercury , which can lead to mercury poisoning when consumed in large quantity or when consumed by certain higher - risk groups , including women who are pregnant or may become pregnant , nursing mothers and young children .
According to recent studies , there have been about 18 million infections worldwide from eating raw fish .
This serves as a great risk to expecting mothers due to the health risks that medical interventions or treatment measures may pose on the developing fetus .
Parasitic infections can have a wide range of health impacts , including bowel obstruction , anemia , liver disease , and more .
The impact of these illnesses alone can pose some health concerns on the expecting mother and baby , but the curative measures that may need to take place to recover , are also a concern as well .
Sashimi or other types of sushi containing raw fish present a risk of infection by three main types of parasites : *
Clonorchis sinensis , a fluke which can cause clonorchiasis
* Anisakis , a roundworm which can cause anisakiasis * Diphyllobothrium , a tapeworm which can cause diphyllobothriasis For the above reasons , EU regulations forbid the use of fresh raw fish .
It must be frozen at temperatures below in all parts of the product for no less than 24 hours .
As such , a number of fishing boats , suppliers and end users " super - freeze " fish for sushi to temperatures as low as −60 ° C .
As well as parasite destruction , super - freezing also prevents oxidation of the blood in tuna flesh , thus preventing the discoloration that happens at temperatures above −20 ° C .
Some forms of sushi , notably those containing pufferfish fugu and some kinds of shellfish , can cause severe poisoning if not prepared properly .
Particularly , fugu consumption can be fatal .
Fugu fish has a lethal dose of tetrodotoxin in its internal organs and , by law in many countries , must be prepared by a licensed fugu chef who has passed the prefectural examination in Japan .
The licensing examination process consists of a written test , a fish - identification test , and a practical test that involves preparing the fugu and separating out the poisonous organs .
Only about 35 percent of the applicants pass .
SUSTAINABLE SUSHI Section::::Sustainable sushi .
Sustainable sushi is sushi made from fished or farmed sources that can be maintained or whose future production does not significantly jeopardize the ecosystems from which it is acquired .
Concerns over the sustainability of sushi ingredients arise from greater concerns over environmental , economic and social stability and human health .
PRESENTATION Section::::Presentation .
Traditionally , sushi is served on minimalist Japanese - style , geometric , mono- or duo - tone wood or lacquer plates , in keeping with the aesthetic qualities of this cuisine .
Many sushi restaurants offer fixed - price sets , selected by the chef from the catch of the day .
These are often graded as shō - chiku - bai ( ) , shō / matsu ( , pine ) , chiku / take ( , bamboo ) and ( bai / ume ) , with matsu the most expensive and ume the cheapest .
Sushi restaurants will often have private booth dining , where guests are asked to remove their shoes , leaving them outside the room ; However , most sushi bars offer diners a casual experience with an open dining room concept .
Sushi may be served kaiten zushi ( sushi train ) style .
Color - coded plates of sushi are placed on a conveyor belt ; as the belt passes , customers choose as they please .
After finishing , the bill is tallied by counting how many plates of each color have been taken .
Newer kaiten zushi restaurants use barcodes or RFID tags embedded in the dishes to manage elapsed time after the item was prepared .

ETIQUETTE Section::::Etiquette .
Unlike sashimi , which is almost always eaten with chopsticks , nigirizushi is traditionally eaten with the fingers , even in formal settings .
Although it is commonly served on a small platter with a side dish for dipping , sushi can also be served in a bento , a box with small compartments that hold the various dishes of the meal .
Soy sauce is the usual condiment , and sushi is normally served with a small sauce dish , or a compartment in the bento .
Traditional etiquette suggests that the sushi is turned over so that only the topping is dipped ; this is because the soy sauce is for flavoring the topping , not the rice , and because the rice would absorb too much soy sauce and would fall apart .
If it is difficult to turn the sushi upside - down , one can baste the sushi in soy sauce using gari ( sliced ginger ) as a brush .
Toppings that have their own sauce ( such as eel ) should not be eaten with soy sauce .
Traditionally , the sushi chef will add an appropriate amount of wasabi to the sushi while preparing it , and etiquette suggests eating the sushi as is , since the chef is supposed to know the proper amount of wasabi to use .
However , today wasabi is more a matter of personal taste , and even restaurants in Japan may serve wasabi on the side for customers to use at their discretion , even when there is wasabi already in the dish .
