TOBACCO USAGE IN SPORT Tobacco usage in sport is a well documented and publicised occurrence .
Tobacco advertising has connected itself to sports both for the connotations of health that sports provide , as well as the marketing potential of famous athletes .
Additionally , tobacco has played a role in the sport of baseball specifically and has affected both the rules affecting players and fan alike .
Agencies such as the CDC have used sports as platforms for tobacco prevention programs , specifically targeted at younger people .
ADVERTISING Section::::Advertising .
For many years , tobacco companies have played a monumental role in advertising within the sports industry .
Major tobacco companies have employed the strategies of athletic endorsements , sponsorships of major athletic events , and creating powerful associations of tobacco and active lifestyles in order to advertise their products .
The connection between sports and tobacco can be traced back to the origins of professional sports .
Shortly after the National Baseball League 's inception in 1876 , trading cards with player 's images emerged within cigarette packages .
One of the oldest brands of chewing tobacco , Bull Durham , advertised on outfield fences in baseball parks in the United States South .
Despite this long - standing history , there have been many recent developments and changes in tobacco 's relation to athletics .
Currently , trends have shifted as athletes today are more likely to endorse tobacco prevention efforts as opposed to tobacco products .
ENDORSEMENTS Section::::Endorsements .
From the 1920s to 1940s baseball furthered its relation with tobacco .
Every major league team had a cigarette sponsor and baseball 's greatest athletes such as Babe Ruth , Joe DiMaggio , and Ted Williams , all appeared in cigarette advertisements .
Lou Gehrig endorsed R. J. Reynolds ' Camels , saying he could smoke as many as he pleased and creating the slogan that Camels " do n't get your wind . "
As tensions mounted in the 1950s , with smoking 's correlation to lung cancer , the Commissioner of Baseball prohibited players from wearing their uniforms in cigarette advertisements .
While baseball cracked down on endorsements , the National Football League not only permitted players to appear in tobacco advertisements but also signed Philip Morris ' Marlboro as its major television sponsor .
Of these players , one of the most prominent was Frank Gifford .
Gifford played for the New York Giants in the 1950s and 1960s and later became a famous sportscaster .
In his prime , Gifford endorsed a wide range of products , including The American Tobacco Company 's Lucky Strike cigarettes .
In 1964 , the tobacco industry began to anticipate increased federal regulation and voluntarily adopted the Cigarette Advertising Code , stating it would not " depict as a smoker any person well known as being , or having been , an athlete …
[or ] any person participating in , or obviously having just participated in , physical activity requiring stamina or athletic conditioning beyond that of normal recreation " .
Under this code , athletes and celebrities were no longer allowed to give testimonials , but nonetheless the industry blatantly disregarded its own guidelines .
In October 2009 , Baisha , China 's largest cigarette company , signed Liu Xiang , an Olympic gold medalist hurdler , to endorse its cigarettes in both print advertisements and televised commercials .
SPONSORSHIPS Section::::Sponsorships .
Traditionally , cigarette companies have had a strong relationship with NASCAR events .
After tobacco companies were forced to pull out of advertising in NASCAR , Nicorette has entered the NASCAR arena and signed a three - year contract as part of an extension by GlaxoSmithKline , then the owner of Goody 's Headache Powders , a long - time NASCAR sponsor .
NASCAR 's deal with Nicorette was only for one year .
Winston stepped down after 33 years as title sponsor of NASCAR 's championship series and was replaced by Nextel .
Nicorette sees a great market as NASCAR fans are 28 % more likely to smoke than other adults .
The firm also reported that they smoke 18 % more cigarettes than other adults .
Since Nicorette has signed on as a sponsor , there has been a substantial decrease in the amount of NASCAR employees who smoke .
Nicorette began its quit smoking program in 2004 , providing NASCAR members with training sessions and one - on - one counseling .
Additionally , Nicorette has counseled about 250,000 race fans on how to quit smoking since 2005 .
Cigarette companies have explored the sponsorship of rodeo since the early 1970s .
From 1986 to 2009 the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association was sponsored by the U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company as well as the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association ( NIRA ) since 1974 .
The association severed its ties with the tobacco industry in 2009 , allowing rodeo culture to return to its status before tobacco 's involvement in 1986 . "
Cowboy Ted " Hallisey , a prominent print and broadcast journalist for rodeo events stated " Without big tobacco , rodeos will move into mainstream sports because they will be more comfortable for children and families to attend " .
ADVERTISING STRATEGIES
Section::::Advertising strategies .
In the early 1900s the tobacco industry sought to pair smoking with active and healthy lifestyles .
Through its advertisements , the tobacco industry created associations between smoking and recreational and athletic activities like tennis , golf , swimming , football , track and field , skiing , and ice skating .
These activities were often depicted in cigarette advertising as activities demanding a cigarette for enhanced performance and even good health .
American Tobacco 's Lucky Strikes ran a successful advertising campaign that urged men and women " To keep a slender figure , reach for a Lucky instead of a sweet . "
ADVERTISING AND SPONSORSHIP
IN AUSTRALIA Section::::Advertising and Sponsorship in Australia .
One of the first countries to ever legislate the end of tobacco advertising and sponsorship at sporting events was Australia .
Quit Victoria in Australia , stated that the three major sponsors for sport in 1980 were the largest tobacco companies .
In 1989 , the tobacco industry put a whopping 34 million dollars into cricket and rugby league .
Although advertisement of tobacco products on television had been banned in 1976 , on ground advertising and naming rights to oppositions and events was tactically used by tobacco companies ; for example , the Benson and Hedges logo would appear for approximately 90 minutes in a day 's play of test cricket .
The tobacco advertising prohibition act 1992 , prohibited nearly all of tobaccos advertising and sponsorships in sporting events .
However , under section 18 of the Act , there was power to allow an exception to the general ban on tobacco advertising in Australia for sporting events of international significance .
In 2000 , there was an amendment to remove this act and Australian sport became totally tobacco sponsorship and advertisement free in October 2006 .
SMOKELESS TOBACCO Section::::Smokeless tobacco .
Smokeless tobacco : chewing tobacco , spit tobacco , dry snuff , snus , or ' tabac à chiquer ' in France , is very common in some sports .
There is little data on the number of athletes that use smokeless tobacco , but a study showed that approximately 45 percent of major league baseball players have been reported to use smokeless tobacco .
Athletes apparently used smokeless tobacco to enhance their performance because nicotine improved certain aspects of physiology .
However , it has been found that smokeless tobacco can cause many harmful health effects such as cancer , mouth and tooth problems , heart disease and high blood pressure .
BASEBALL AND TOBACCO Section::::Baseball and tobacco .
Between 1920 until 1940 , when baseball was Americas most popular sport , every team had a tobacco sponsor .
It is common perception that many baseball players use tobacco .
According to the MLB however this practice is changing and declining .
One source states that a reason chewing tobacco usage increased among baseball players was the misconception that it improved concentration , overall performance and was less harmful than smoking a cigarette .
Contrary to this , chewing tobacco does not have an established connection to the performance of baseball players .
As more information about the dangers of chewing tobacco has come to light
it has become stigmatized within baseball itself with players , staff and managers often having to " sneak " off to partake .
These individuals understand that children will easily copy their actions and try to hide them now , as they are negative role models for youth .
Most players have made attempts to quit , but the majority struggle in breaking their addiction .
Lenny Dykstra , the former Philadelphia Phillies center - fielder , started dipping at a young age , unaware of how difficult quitting would be .
He tells young children , " They call me " Nails " because they say I 'm as tough as nails .
But I 'm not tough enough to beat the spit - tobacco habit .
Copy my hustle , copy my determination .
But do n't copy my spit - tobacco habit . "
In addition Major League Baseball has taken actions to lower tobacco usage amongst its players .
This includes a complete ban on tobacco with fines for players and their managers if it is discovered .
In the major leagues tobacco companies are no longer allowed to leave free products in stadium clubhouses for the players , with a ban effective December 5 , 2016 , in the new Collective Bargaining Agreement that prohibits players entering MLB for the first time from using tobacco .
( Players who had experience in MLB prior to the day are grandfathered . )
Baseball stadiums have stricter tobacco policies for patrons as well though the level of strictness varies per stadium .
+ A breakdown of Major League Baseball TOBACCO PREVENTION AND SPORTS Section::::Tobacco prevention and sports .
The majority of tobacco smokers start smoking before they graduate high school .
The CDC has identified youth sports as an area where tobacco education and prevention will help limit the number of first time smokers and has begun a Tobacco Free Sports Movement to encourage non smoking practices in athletics .
The CDC has paired with many large organizations to achieve this goal .
These include public health agencies such as the National Cancer Institute , and sport regulatory bodies such as FIFA and the International Olympic Committee to further the efforts of tobacco elimination in sports .
The 2008 Beijing Olympics banned not only tobacco usage , but advertising , sponsorship , promotion and sale of tobacco products in Olympic venues .
The last Olympics with a tobacco company as a sponsor were in 1984 , and control has gotten stricter since then ( as can be seen from the Beijing regulations ) .
On a smaller scale there are regional efforts to create tobacco free sports initiatives such as the Tobacco - Free Athletes of Maine .
This organization seeks to have coaches educate their young athletes about the effects of tobacco .
Many athletes have become spokespersons for anti - tobacco and tobacco prevention efforts .
Early in the 20th century Hall of Fame baseball player Honus Wagner would not allow a cigarette company to use his picture on a tobacco trading card .
Since then famous athletes like skateboarder Tony Hawk and baseball player Sammy Sosa have supported tobacco prevention .
Events such as the American Cancer Society 's Great American Smokeout also make use of athletes to support their anti - tobacco efforts .
In 2000 , the American Cancer Society had Alonzo Mourning of the Miami Heat ( with other athletes ) speak to children about the dangers of smoking .
Recently in the 2010 Winter Olympics , the Canada women 's national ice hockey team celebrated their gold medal victory on the ice with both cigars and tobacco .
