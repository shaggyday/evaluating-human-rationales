A Sports Illustrated article stated he was named for Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Drew Pearson but in a 2014 interview Brees said this story was " just legend " .
He has a younger brother , Reid ( born 1981 ) .
When Brees was seven , his parents divorced and shared custody of the boys , who split their time between both parents ' homes .
Today , Brees admits that it was a very tough and challenging life after the divorce ; however , Brees and his younger brother , Reid , supported each other and became very close .
They have a younger half - sister , Audrey , from their father 's remarriage to Amy Hightower , daughter of the late U.S. Representative ( D - TX )
Jack English Hightower .
Both of Brees ' parents had athletic backgrounds .
His father played basketball for the Texas A&M Aggies men 's basketball team , and his mother was a former all - state in three sports in high school .
His maternal uncle , Marty Akins , was an All - American starting quarterback for the Texas Longhorns college football team from 1975 to 1977 and his maternal grandfather , Ray Akins , had the third - most victories as a Texas high school football coach in his three decades at Gregory - Portland High School .

Today All - USA high school football team alongside former San Diego Chargers teammate and long - time friend LaDainian Tomlinson .

Section::::2001
NFL Draft .
Brees ' college success led to projections that he would be a mid – late first - round draft pick in the 2001 NFL Draft , but he slipped due to concerns about his relatively short stature for a professional quarterback ( 6 ' ) , a perceived lack of arm strength , and a sense that he had succeeded in college in a spread offense .
Brees was the second quarterback , behind Michael Vick of Virginia Tech , selected in the 2001 Draft , chosen by the San Diego Chargers as the first pick of the second round and 32nd overall .
San Diego originally had the first pick in that draft , but traded it to Atlanta ( which had drafted Vick ) in return for the fifth pick of the first round , with which San Diego drafted LaDainian Tomlinson .
