REPEATING DECIMAL
A repeating or recurring decimal is decimal representation of a number whose digits are periodic ( repeating its values at regular intervals ) and the infinitely repeated portion is not zero .
It can be shown that a number is rational if and only if its decimal representation is repeating or terminating ( i.e. all except finitely many digits are zero ) .
For example , the decimal representation of ⅓ becomes periodic just after the decimal point , repeating the single digit " 3 " forever , i.e. 0.333 … .
A more complicated example is , whose decimal becomes periodic at the second digit following the decimal point and then repeats the sequence " 144 " forever , i.e. 5.8144144144 … .
At present , there is no single universally accepted notation or phrasing for repeating decimals .
The infinitely repeated digit sequence is called the repetend or reptend .
If the repetend is a zero , this decimal representation is called a terminating decimal rather than a repeating decimal , since the zeros can be omitted and the decimal terminates before these zeros .
Every terminating decimal representation can be written as a decimal fraction , a fraction whose divisor is a power of 10 ( e.g. ) ; it may also be written as a ratio of the form ( e.g. ) .
However , every number with a terminating decimal representation also trivially has a second , alternative representation as a repeating decimal whose repetend is the digit 9 .
This is obtained by decreasing the final non - zero digit by one and appending a repetend of 9 . and are two examples of this .
( This type of repeating decimal can be obtained by long division if one uses a modified form of the usual division algorithm . )
Any number that can not be expressed as a ratio of two integers is said to be irrational .
Their decimal representation neither terminates nor infinitely repeats but extends forever without regular repetition .
Examples of such irrational numbers are the square root of 2 and .
BACKGROUND NOTATION Section::::Background .
Section::::Notation .
There are several notational conventions for representing repeating decimals .
None of them are accepted universally .
*
In the United States , India , France , and Switzerland , the convention is to draw a horizontal line ( a vinculum ) above the repetend .
( See examples in table below , column Vinculum . )
*
In the United Kingdom and mainland China , the convention is to place dots above the outermost numerals of the repetend .
( See examples in table below , column Dots . )
*
In parts of Europe , the convention is to enclose the repetend in parentheses .
( See examples in table below , column Parentheses . )
*
In Spain and some Latin American countries , the arc notation over the repetend is also used as an alternative to the vinculum and the dots notation .
( See examples in table below , column Arc . )
*
Informally , repeating decimals are often represented by an ellipsis ( three periods , e.g. , ) , especially when the previous notational conventions are first taught in school .
This notation is nonambiguous when only one digit is repeated .
However , it should be avoided when several digits are repeated , for it introduces uncertainty as to which digits should be repeated and even whether repetition is occurring at all , since such ellipses are also employed for irrational numbers such as .

In English , there are various ways to read repeating decimals aloud .
For example , formula_22 may be read " one point three repeating " , " one point three repeated " , " one point three recurring " , or " one point three into infinity " . DECIMAL EXPANSION AND RECURRENCE SEQUENCE Section::::Decimal expansion and recurrence sequence .
In order to convert a rational number represented as a fraction into decimal form , one may use long division .
For example , consider the rational number 5/74 : etc .
Observe that at each step we have a remainder ; the successive remainders displayed above are 56 , 42 , 50 .
When we arrive at 50 as the remainder , and bring down the " 0 " , we find ourselves dividing 500 by 74 , which is the same problem we began with .
Therefore , the decimal repeats : 0.0675 675 675 … .
EVERY RATIONAL NUMBER IS EITHER A TERMINATING OR REPEATING DECIMAL Section::::Every rational number is either a terminating or repeating decimal .
For any given divisor , only finitely many different remainders can occur .
In the example above , the 74 possible remainders are 0 , 1 , 2 , … , 73 .
If at any point in the division the remainder is 0 , the expansion terminates at that point .
If 0 never occurs as a remainder , then the division process continues forever , and eventually a remainder must occur that has occurred before .
The next step in the division will yield the same new digit in the quotient , and the same new remainder , as the previous time the remainder was the same .
Therefore , the following division will repeat the same results .
EVERY REPEATING OR TERMINATING DECIMAL IS A RATIONAL NUMBER
Section::::Every repeating or terminating decimal is a rational number .
Each repeating decimal number satisfies a linear equation with integer coefficients , and its unique solution is a rational number .
To illustrate the latter point , the number above satisfies the equation whose solution is .
The process of how to find these integer coefficients is described below .

The periods of 1 / n , n = 1 , 2 , 3 , ... , are : The periodic parts of 1 / n are : The periods of 1/(nth prime ) are : The least primes p for which 1 / p has period n are : The least primes p for which k / p has n different cycles ( ) are : FRACTIONS WITH PRIME DENOMINATORS Section::::Fractions with prime denominators .
A fraction in lowest terms with a prime denominator other than 2 or 5 ( i.e. coprime to 10 ) always produces a repeating decimal .
The length of the repetend ( period of the repeating decimal segment ) of 1 / p is equal to the order of 10 modulo p.
If 10 is a primitive root modulo p , the repetend length is equal to p − 1 ; if not , the repetend length is a factor of p − 1 .
This result can be deduced from Fermat 's little theorem , which states that The base-10 repetend of the reciprocal of any prime number greater than 5 is divisible by 9 .
If the repetend length of 1 / p for prime p is equal to p − 1 then the repetend , expressed as an integer , is called a cyclic number .

The reason for the cyclic behavior is apparent from an arithmetic exercise of long division of : the sequential remainders are the cyclic sequence { 1 , 3 , 2 , 6 , 4 , 5 } .
See also the article 142857 for more properties of this cyclic number .
A fraction which is cyclic thus has a recurring decimal of even length that divides into two sequences in 9 's complement form .
For example 1/7 starts ' 142 ' and is followed by ' 857 ' while 6/7 ( by rotation ) starts ' 857 ' followed by its 9 's complement ' 142 ' .
A proper prime is a prime p which ends in the digit 1 in base 10 and whose reciprocal in base 10 has a repetend with length p − 1 .
In such primes , each digit 0 , 1 , formula_23 , 9 appears in the repeating sequence the same number of times as does each other digit ( namely , ( p − 1)/10 times ) .
They are : A prime is a proper prime if and only if it is a full reptend prime and congruent to 1
mod 10 .
If a prime p is both full reptend prime and safe prime , then 1 / p will produce a stream of p − 1 pseudo - random digits .
Those primes are OTHER RECIPROCALS OF PRIMES
Section::::Other reciprocals of primes .
Some reciprocals of primes that do not generate cyclic numbers are : * 1/3 = 0.3 , which has a period of 1 .
* 1/11 = 0.09 , which has a period of 2 .
* 1/13 = 0.076923 , which has a period of 6 .
* 1/31 = 0.032258064516129 , which has a period of 15 .
* 1/37 = 0.027 , which has a period of 3 .
* 1/41 = 0.02439 , which has a period of 5 .
* 1/43 = 0.023255813953488372093 , which has a period of 21 .
* 1/53 = 0.0188679245283 , which has a period of 13 .
* 1/67 = 0.014925373134328358208955223880597 , which has a period of 33 .
The reason is that 3 is a divisor of 9 , 11 is a divisor of 99 , 41 is a divisor of 99999 , etc .
To find the period of 1 / p , we can check whether the prime p divides some number 999 ... 999 in which the number of digits divides p − 1 .
Since the period is never greater than p − 1 , we can obtain this by calculating formula_38 For example , for 11 we get and then by inspection find the repetend 09 and period of 2 .
Those reciprocals of primes can be associated with several sequences of repeating decimals .
For example , the multiples of 1/13 can be divided into two sets , with different repetends .
The first set is : *
1/13
= 0.076923
formula_23
* 10/13 =
0.769230
formula_23
* 9/13 = 0.692307
formula_23
* 12/13 = 0.923076
formula_23
* 3/13 = 0.230769
formula_23
* 4/13 = 0.307692
formula_23 , where the repetend of each fraction is a cyclic re - arrangement of 076923 .
The second set is : *
2/13 =
0.153846
formula_23
* 7/13 =
0.538461
formula_23
* 5/13 = 0.384615
formula_23
* 11/13 =
0.846153
formula_23
* 6/13 = 0.461538
formula_23
* 8/13 = 0.615384
formula_51 where the repetend of each fraction is a cyclic re - arrangement of 153846 .
In general , the set of proper multiples of reciprocals of a prime p consists of n subsets , each with repetend length k , where nk = p − 1 . TOTIENT RULE Section::::Totient rule .
For an arbitrary integer n
the length formula_52 of the repetend of 1 / n
divides formula_53 , where formula_54 is the totient function .
The length is equal to formula_53 if and only if 10 is a primitive root modulo n.
In particular , it follows that formula_56 if and only if p is a prime and 10 is
a primitive root modulo
p.
Then , the decimal expansions of n / p for n = 1 , 2 , … , p − 1 , all have period p − 1 and differ only by a cyclic permutation .
Such numbers p are called full repetend primes .
RECIPROCALS OF COMPOSITE INTEGERS COPRIME TO 10 Section::::Reciprocals of composite integers coprime to 10 .
If p is a prime other than 2 or 5 , the decimal representation of the fraction formula_57 repeats , e.g. :
The period ( repetend length ) must be a factor of λ(49 ) = 42 , where λ(n ) is known as the Carmichael function .
This follows from Carmichael 's theorem which states that if n is a positive integer then λ(n ) is the smallest integer m such that for every integer a that is coprime to n.
The period of formula_57 is usually pT , where T is the period of formula_60 .
There are three known primes for which this is not true , and for those the period of formula_57 is the same as the period of formula_60 because p divides 10−1 .
These three primes are 3 , 487 and 56598313 .
Similarly , the period of formula_63 is usually pT If p and q are primes other than 2 or 5 , the decimal representation of the fraction formula_64 repeats .
An example is 1/119 : where LCM denotes the least common multiple .
The period T of formula_64 is a factor of λ(pq ) and it happens to be 48 in this case :
The period T of formula_64 is LCM(T , T ) , where T is the period of formula_60 and T is the period of formula_68 .
If p , q , r etc .
are primes other than 2 or 5 , and k , ℓ , m etc .
are positive integers , then formula_69 is a repeating decimal with a period of formula_70 where formula_71 , etc .
are respectively the period of the repeating decimals
formula_72 etc .
as defined above .
RECIPROCALS OF INTEGERS
NOT CO - PRIME TO 10 Section::::Reciprocals of integers not co - prime to 10 .
An integer that is not co - prime to 10 but has a prime factor other than 2 or 5 has a reciprocal that is eventually periodic , but with a non - repeating sequence of digits that precede the repeating part .
The reciprocal can be expressed as : where a and b are not both zero .
This fraction can also be expressed as : if a > b , or as if b > a , or as if a = b.
The decimal has : * An initial transient of max(a , b ) digits after the decimal point .
Some or all of the digits in the transient can be zeros .
* A subsequent repetend which is the same as that for the fraction formula_77 .
For example 1/28 = 0.03571428571428 … :
* the initial non - repeating digits are 03 ; and * the subsequent repeating digits are 571428 .
CONVERTING REPEATING DECIMALS TO FRACTIONS
Section::::Converting repeating decimals to fractions .
Given a repeating decimal , it is possible to calculate the fraction that produced it .
For example : Another example : A SHORTCUT Section::::A shortcut .
The procedure below can be applied in particular if the repetend has n digits , all of which are 0 except the final one which is 1 .
For instance for n = 7 : So this particular repeating decimal corresponds to the fraction 1/(10 − 1 ) , where the denominator is the number written as n digits 9 .
Knowing just that , a general repeating decimal can be expressed as a fraction without having to solve an equation .
For example , one could reason : It is possible to get a general formula expressing a repeating decimal with an n digit period ( repetend length ) , beginning right after the decimal point , as a fraction : More explicitly one gets the following cases .
If the repeating decimal is between 0 and 1 , and the repeating block is n digits long , first occurring right after the decimal point , then the fraction ( not necessarily reduced ) will be the integer number represented by the n - digit block divided by the one represented by n digits 9 .
For example , * 0.444444 formula_23 = 4/9 since the repeating block is 4 ( a 1-digit block ) , * 0.565656 formula_23 = 56/99 since the repeating block is 56 ( a 2-digit block ) , * 0.012012 formula_23 = 12/999 since the repeating block is 012 ( a 3-digit block ) , and this further reduces to 4/333 .
* 0.9999999 formula_23 = 9/9 = 1 , since the repeating block is 9 ( also a 1-digit block )
If the repeating decimal is as above , except that there are k ( extra ) digits 0 between the decimal point and the repeating n - digit block , then one can simply add k digits 0 after the n digits 9 of the denominator ( and , as before , the fraction may subsequently be simplified ) .
For example , * 0.000444 formula_23 = 4/9000 since the repeating block is 4 and this block is preceded by 3 zeros , * 0.005656 formula_23 = 56/9900 since the repeating block is 56 and it is preceded by 2 zeros ,
* 0.00012012 formula_23 = 12/99900 = 1/8325 since the repeating block is 012 and it is preceded by 2 zeros .
Any repeating decimal not of the form described above can be written as a sum of a terminating decimal and a repeating decimal of one of the two above types ( actually the first type suffices , but that could require the terminating decimal to be negative ) .
For example , * 1.23444 formula_23 = 1.23 + 0.00444 formula_23 = 123/100 + 4/900 = 1107/900 + 4/900 = 1111/900 or alternatively 1.23444
formula_23 = 0.79 +
0.44444 formula_23 = 79/100 +
4/9
= 711/900
+ 400/900 = 1111/900
* 0.3789789 formula_23 = 0.3 + 0.0789789
formula_23 = 3/10 + 789/9990 =
2997/9990 + 789/9990 =
3786/9990
= 631/1665 or alternatively 0.3789789 formula_23 = −0.6 + 0.9789789 formula_23 =
−6/10
+ 978/999 = −5994/9990 + 9780/9990
= 3786/9990 =
631/1665
It follows that any repeating decimal with period n , and k digits after the decimal point that do not belong to the repeating part , can be written as a ( not necessarily reduced ) fraction whose denominator is ( 10 − 1)10 .
Conversely the period of the repeating decimal of a fraction c / d will be ( at most )
the smallest number n such that 10 − 1 is divisible by d.
For example , the fraction 2/7 has d = 7 , and the smallest k that makes 10 − 1 divisible by 7 is k = 6 , because 999999 = 7 × 142857 .
The period of the fraction 2/7 is therefore 6 .
REPEATING DECIMALS
AS INFINITE SERIES Section::::Repeating decimals as infinite series .
A repeating decimal can also be expressed as an infinite series .
That is , a repeating decimal can be regarded as the sum of an infinite number of rational numbers .
To take the simplest example , The above series is a geometric series with the first term as 1/10 and the common factor 1/10 .
Because the absolute value of the common factor is less than 1 , we can say that the geometric series converges and find the exact value in the form of a fraction by using the following formula where a is the first term of the series and r is the common factor .
MULTIPLICATION AND CYCLIC PERMUTATION Section::::Multiplication and cyclic permutation .
The cyclic behavior of repeating decimals in multiplication also leads to the construction of integers which are cyclically permuted when multiplied by certain numbers .
For example , 102564 x 4 = 410256 .
Note that 102564 is the repetend of 4/39 and 410256 the repetend of 16/39 .
OTHER PROPERTIES OF REPETEND
LENGTHS Section::::Other properties of repetend lengths .
Various properties of repetend lengths ( periods ) are given by Mitchell and Dickson .
The period of 1 / k for integer k is always ≤ k − 1 .
If p is prime , the period of 1 / p divides evenly into p − 1 .
If k is composite , the period of 1 / k is strictly less than k − 1 .
The period of c / k , for c coprime to k , equals the period of 1 / k .
If formula_99 where n > 1 and n is not divisible by 2 or 5 , then the length of the transient of 1 / k is max(a , b ) , and the period equals r , where r is the smallest integer such that formula_100 .
If p , p ' , p " , … are distinct primes , then the period of 1/(pp'p " … ) equals the lowest common multiple of the periods of 1 / p , 1 / p ' , 1 / p " , … .
If k and k ' have no common prime factors other than 2 and/or 5 , then the period of formula_101 equals the least common multiple of the periods of formula_102 and formula_103 .
For prime p , if formula_104 but formula_105 , then for formula_106 we have formula_107 .
If p is a proper prime ending in a 1 that is , if the repetend of 1 / p is a cyclic number of length p − 1 and p = 10h + 1 for some h – then each digit 0 , 1 , … ,
9 appears in the repetend exactly h =
( p − 1)/10 times .
For some other properties of repetends , see also .
EXTENSION TO OTHER BASES Section::::Extension to other bases .
Various features of repeating decimals extend to the representation of numbers in all other integer bases , not just base 10 :
* Any number can be represented as an integer component followed by a radix point ( the generalization of a decimal point to non - decimal systems ) followed by a finite or infinite number of digits .
* A rational number has a terminating sequence after the radix point if all the prime factors of the denominator of the fully reduced fractional form are also factors of the base .
This terminating representation is equivalent to a representation with a repeating sequence that can be constructed from the terminating form by decreasing the last digit by 1 and appending an infinite sequence of a digit representing a number that is one less than the base .
* A rational number has an infinitely repeating sequence of finite length less than the value of the fully reduced fraction 's denominator if the reduced fraction 's denominator contains a prime factor that is not a factor of the base .
The repeating sequence is preceded after the radix point by a transient of finite length if the reduced fraction also shares a prime factor with the base .
*
An irrational number has a representation of infinite length that is not , from any point , an infinitely repeating sequence of finite length .
For example , in duodecimal , 1/2 = 0.6 , 1/3 = 0.4 , 1/4 = 0.3 and 1/6 = 0.2 all terminate ; 1/5 = 0.2497 repeats with period 4 , in contrast with the equivalent decimal expansion of 0.2 ; 1/7 = 0.186ᘔ35 has period 6 in duodecimal , just as it does in decimal .
If b is an integer base and k is an integer ,
For example 1/7 in duodecimal :
Which is 0.186ᘔ35
( base 12 ) .
Note that 10 ( base 12 ) is 12 ( base 10 ) , 10 ^ 2 ( base 12 ) is 144 ( base 10 ) , 21 ( base 12 ) is 25 ( base 10 ) ,
ᘔ5 ( base 12 ) is 125 ( base 10 ) , ... APPLICATIONS TO CRYPTOGRAPHY Section::::Applications to cryptography .
Repeating decimals ( also called decimal sequences ) have found cryptographic and error - correction coding applications .
In these applications repeating decimals to base 2 are generally used which gives rise to binary sequences .
The maximum length binary sequence for 1 / p ( when 2 is a primitive root of p ) is given by :
These sequences of period p − 1 have an autocorrelation function that has a negative peak of −1 for shift of ( p − 1)/2 .
The randomness of these sequences has been examined by diehard tests .
