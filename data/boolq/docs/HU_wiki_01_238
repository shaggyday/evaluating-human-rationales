DEVELOPMENT Section::::Development .

The four couples selected for the first season were announced on the official Facebook page on 17 June 2012 .
DIFFERENCES FROM THE AUSTRALIAN SERIES Section::::Differences from the Australian series .
The series differs from the original Australian version in several ways .
In the New Zealand version , the final contestants have been pre - determined by the show 's producers .
This contrasts to the Australian version , where the final couples are decided from a shortlist in an elimination week .
In the New Zealand version , the show aired twice a week in the first season , thrice a week in the second season , and four times a week in the third season , as opposed to the Australian show 's Sunday to Thursday schedule .
In all four seasons thus far , there are challenges to determine auction order rather than contestants deciding amongst themselves , or being randomly drawn out , and the final challenge winners never have an amount knocked off the original reserve price .
