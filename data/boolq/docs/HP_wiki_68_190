Since 22 February 2017 , New Hampshire is a constitutional carry state , requiring no license to open carry or concealed carry a firearm in public .
Concealed carry permits are still issued for purposes of reciprocity with other states .
The New Hampshire license is issued for carry of a " pistol or revolver , " and is not a license to carry " weapons " as exists in some other states .
The New Hampshire license is issued by the local mayor , selectmen , or police department at a cost of $ 10 for residents , and by the New Hampshire State Police at a cost of $ 100 for non - residents ( changed from $ 20 on July 1 , 2009 ) .
The term of issue of the license is five years .
Turn around time is generally one to two weeks , with fourteen days being the maximum time allowed by law .
New Hampshire has no laws restricting the age at which a person may possess and carry firearms .
On June 2 , 2016 , the New Hampshire Supreme Court , in Bach v. New Hampshire Dept . of Safety , No . 2014â€“0721 , 2016 WL 3086130 , threw out a rule imposed by concealed carry permit issuing authorities that had required non - residents to have a permit to carry issued by the state in which they resided .
The basis for invalidating such rule was that it denied a New Hampshire non - resident permit to residents of jurisdictions that are effectively No - Issue , such as New Jersey , California , Hawaii , and others .
