At the 1970 FIFA World Cup , Israel participated for the first time .
Israel qualified for the FIFA World Cup for the first time in 1970 , along with El Salvador and Morocco .
Although it was reported in the build - up to the final draw that seedings would be used , as had been the case at the previous two World Cup Finals , the FIFA Organising Committee ultimately announced that there would be no seeding of teams .
Instead , the sixteen teams were divided into four ' geographical groupings ' , which also took into account the teams ' strengths and even political considerations ; the system ensured that Israel and Morocco would not be drawn to face each other after Morocco had earlier threatened to withdraw from the tournament , as they had done from the Olympic football tournament two years earlier , if that were the case .

At the 1958 FIFA World Cup , Israel competed in the Africa and Asia qualification round .
The round was conducted in a knockout stage format .
Israel won its group by default because its three opponents , Turkey , Indonesia and Sudan , refused to play .
The national team was placed in the African / Asian zone and was drawn to play against Turkey in the first round .
However , Turkey withdrew in protest of being placed in the African / Asian zone ( instead of the European Zone ) , and Israel advanced to the second round without playing a match , along with Indonesia , Egypt and Sudan .
Israel was drawn to play Indonesia , but , as Indonesia refused to play in Israel and as FIFA rejected their request to play against Israel on neutral ground , Indonesia withdrew and Israel advanced to the regional finals , again without playing a match , alongside Sudan .
In the final round , Sudan refused to play Israel for political reasons and withdrew .
FIFA had imposed a rule that no team would qualify without playing at least one match , after it had happened in several previous World Cups .
Wales , which finished second in its group behind Czechoslovakia , was drawn into a play - off , which they won .
