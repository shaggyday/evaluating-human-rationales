LIST OF SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS
The Super Bowl is the annual American football game that determines the champion of the National Football League ( NFL ) .
The game culminates a season that begins in the previous calendar year , and is the conclusion of the NFL playoffs .
The contest is held in an American city , chosen three to four years beforehand , usually at warm - weather sites or domed stadiums .
Since January 1971 , the winner of the American Football Conference ( AFC ) Championship Game has faced the winner of the National Football Conference ( NFC ) Championship Game in the culmination of the NFL playoffs .
Before the 1970 merger between the American Football League ( AFL ) and the National Football League ( NFL ) , the two leagues met in four such contests .
The first two were marketed as the " AFL – NFL World Championship Game " , but were also casually referred to as " the Super Bowl game " during the television broadcast .
Super Bowl III in January 1969 was the first such game that carried the " Super Bowl " moniker in official marketing ; the names " Super Bowl I " and " Super Bowl II " were retroactively applied to the first two games .
The NFC / NFL leads in Super Bowl wins with 27 , while the AFC / AFL has won 25 .
Twenty franchises , including teams that have relocated to another city , have won the Super Bowl .
The Pittsburgh Steelers ( 6–2 ) have won the most Super Bowls with six championships , while the New England Patriots ( 5–5 ) , the Dallas Cowboys ( 5–3 ) , and the San Francisco 49ers ( 5–1 ) have five wins .
New England has the most Super Bowl appearances with ten , while the Buffalo Bills ( 0–4 ) have the most consecutive appearances with four ( all losses ) from 1990 to 1993 .
The Miami Dolphins are the only other team to have at least three consecutive appearances : 1972–1974 .
The Denver Broncos ( 3–5 ) and Patriots have each lost a record five Super Bowls .
The Minnesota Vikings ( 0–4 ) and the Bills have lost four .
The record for consecutive wins is two and is shared by seven franchises : the Green Bay Packers ( 1966–1967 ) , the Miami Dolphins ( 1972–1973 ) , the Pittsburgh Steelers ( 1974–1975 and 1978–1979 , the only team to accomplish this feat twice ) , the San Francisco 49ers ( 1988–1989 ) , the Dallas Cowboys ( 1992–1993 ) , the Denver Broncos ( 1997–1998 ) , and the New England Patriots ( 2003–2004 ) .
Among those , Dallas ( 1992–1993 ; 1995 ) and New England ( 2001 ; 2003–2004 ) are the only teams to win three out of four consecutive Super Bowls .
The 1972 Dolphins capped off the only perfect season in NFL history with their victory in Super Bowl VII .
The only team with multiple Super Bowl appearances and no losses is the Baltimore Ravens , who in winning Super Bowl XLVII defeated and replaced the 49ers in that position .
Four current NFL teams have never appeared in a Super Bowl , including franchise relocations and renaming : the Cleveland Browns , Detroit Lions , Jacksonville Jaguars , and Houston Texans , though both the Browns ( 1964 ) and Lions ( 1957 ) had won NFL championship games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl .
