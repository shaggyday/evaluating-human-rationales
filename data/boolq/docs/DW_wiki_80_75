LOCKNUT A locknut , also known as a lock nut , locking nut , prevailing torque nut , stiff nut or elastic stop nut , is a nut that resists loosening under vibrations and torque .
Elastic stop nuts and prevailing torque nuts
are of the particular type where some portion of the nut deforms elastically to provide a locking action .
The first type used fiber instead of nylon and was invented in 1931 .
Locknuts , jam nuts , lock washers , and thread - locking fluid are ways to prevent vibration from loosening a bolted joint .
TYPES Section::::Types .
There are various kinds of specialised lock nuts , including :
* Castellated nut * Distorted thread locknut * Centerlock nut
*
Elliptical offset locknut
* Toplock nut
*
Philidas nut
* Interfering thread nut * Tapered thread nut
*
Jam nut
* Jet nut ( K - nut )
* Keps nut ( K - nut or washer nut ) with a free - spinning washer .
In the locknut form , this is a star - type lock washer .
* Plate nut
* Polymer insert nut ( Nyloc nut )
* Security Lock Nut All steel reusable nut for high vibration and harsh environments .
*
Serrated face nut
* Serrated flange nut
* Speed nut ( sheet metal nut or Tinnerman nut )
* Split beam nut
* Palnut PREVAILING
TORQUE VALUES
Section::::Prevailing torque values .
Prevailing torque differentiates a locknut from a free spinning nut based on a value of how much torque is required during installation before clamp loading .
For example , on a nylon - insert nut , it is the torque needed to overcome the resistance of the nylon dragging across the mating thread .
This torque value is usually not very high relative to final installation torque .
Tolerance ranges for torque are specified in some standards such as ( ISO , DIN , IFI , ASME , SAE , AN- , MS- , NAS- NASM- ) .
