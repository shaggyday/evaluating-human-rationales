FIFA WORLD CUP QUALIFICATION
The FIFA World Cup qualification is the process that a national association football team goes through to qualify for the FIFA World Cup finals .
The FIFA World Cup is the largest international team sport competition in the world with a qualification process required to reduce the large field of countries from 211 to just 32 for the World Cup finals .
Qualifying tournaments are held within the six FIFA continental zones ( Africa , Asia , North and Central America and Caribbean , South America , Oceania , Europe ) , and are organized by their respective confederations .
For each tournament , FIFA decides beforehand the number of places in the finals allocated to each of the continental zones , based on the numbers or relative strength of the confederations ' teams .
The hosts of the World Cup receive an automatic berth .
Unlike many other sports , results of the previous World Cups or of the continental championships are not taken into account .
Until 2002 , the defending champions also received an automatic berth , but starting from the 2006 World Cup this is no longer the case .
The most recent qualification process was the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification which commenced in 2015 and finished in 2017 .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Over many years , the World Cup 's qualification has evolved , from having no qualification at all in 1930 , when the tournament was invitational and only 13 teams entered , to the current two - year process .
The first World Cup qualifying match was played on 11 June when Sweden defeated Estonia 6–2 in Stockholm .
The first ever goal in a World Cup qualifying match was scored 7 minutes into the game : it was scored according to some sources by Swedish captain Knut Kroon , or according to other sources by Estonian goalkeeper Evald Tipner ( own goal ) .
While the number of teams which qualified for the finals has increased steadily , from 16 between 1934 and 1978 , to 24 between 1982 and 1994 , and finally to 32
starting from 1998 , the qualification format has been basically the same throughout the history of the World Cup .
The teams have been grouped continentally , and they competed for a fixed number of places , with one or two places awarded to the winners of intercontinental play - offs .
QUALIFICATION SPOTS
BY CONTINENT Section::::Qualification spots by continent .
The table below lists the numbers of spots allocated by FIFA for each continent in each tournament .
If no places were allocated to a continent as per the case of Oceania prior to 1966 and Africa in 1938 - 1954 and 1966 , this does not indicate an exclusion of those continents by FIFA , but rather that no country from those continents made an entry to the aforementioned Cups .
It should be noted that a large part of Africa was under European colonial rule for the majority of the 20th century .
Consequently , only three African countries were affiliated to FIFA in 1954 : Egypt ( since 1923 ) , Sudan ( since 1948 ) and Ethiopia ( since 1952 ) .
Egypt entered the 1934 , 1938 and 1954 Cups , but not the 1930 or 1950 Cups , while Sudan and Ethiopia did not enter the Cup until 1958 .
Though an African country , Egypt entered in 1938 and 1954 in the European group , and therefore the table below gives no data about Africa for these two Cups .
Places in the intercontinental play - offs count as 0.5 spots , and numbers in bold represent the winners of the intercontinental play - offs . "
+ C " denotes an additional spot for defending champions ( 1938 - 2002 ) , and " + H " denotes an additional spot for host nations ( from 1938 ) .

Currently , 32 places are available in the final tournament until 2022 .
One of them is reserved for the host nation , but if two or more nations co - host the competition , each is awarded a place .
From 1934 to 2002 , one berth was reserved for the winners of the previous World Cup , but in November 2001 , FIFA announced that the defending champion would no longer get automatic entry to the subsequent tournament , starting with the 2006 finals .
This decision was made to address the issue of the returning champions being at a disadvantage to their fellow competitors due to having not played a competitive match in the previous two years .
The problem was amply demonstrated at the 2002 FIFA World Cup , as returning champions France tumbled out in the first round , finishing bottom of their group without scoring a single goal .
2002 winner Brazil qualified for 2006 at the top of their qualifiers group , but Italy , defending champions from 2006 , finished bottom of their group in 2010 , despite playing in the qualifying matches .
At Brazil 2014 , 2010 champions Spain finished third in their group and failed to advance to the Round of 16 , despite having qualified as first in their group .
FIFA decides beforehand the number of spots awarded to each of the continental zones .
For the 2018 World Cup , the following numbers were used : * UEFA ( Europe ) – 13 berths , plus the host Russia
* CAF ( Africa ) –
5 berths * AFC ( Asia ) – 4 berths
* CONMEBOL ( South America ) – 4 berths * CONCACAF ( North and Central America and Caribbean ) – 3 berths * 2 berths for the winners of intercontinental play - offs between the best team from the OFC ( Oceania ) , as well as additional teams from the AFC , CONMEBOL and CONCACAF .
The pairings for these play - offs were determined by an open draw .
The number of berths allocated per continent is widely debated , with the main point of contention being the extent to which berths should be allocated to regions based on sheer population vs. talent .
A historically weaker continent , Africa has called for more places , as they are allocated only five in comparison to Europe 's 13 .
In early October 2016 , it was announced that the World Cup would have featured 40 teams starting with the 2026 tournament , then FIFA President Gianni Infantino stated his support for a 48-team World Cup , mainly to address African concerns .
On 10 January 2017 , the FIFA Council voted unanimously to expand the World Cup to a 48 team tournament that will open with a group stage consisting of 16 groups of three teams , with two teams progressing from each group to a knockout tournament starting with a round of 32 .
The new format for the qualifying process has yet to be confirmed , other than a play - off tournament that consists of one team from each confederation ( except UEFA ) and one additional team from the confederation of the host country for the last two World Cup berths .
These numbers vary slightly between tournaments ( see above ) .
Qualification in all zones ends at approximately the same time , in September – November of the year preceding the finals .
The formats of the qualification tournaments differ between confederations and over time .
The systems used in 2018 are outlined below .
AFRICA Section::::Africa .
The CAF qualification process began with two preliminary rounds to narrow the field of 53 entrants to 20 teams in October 2015 ( Zimbabwe were disqualified ) .
The group stage consisted of 5 groups of 4 , with the group winners advancing to the World Cup finals .
ASIA Section::::Asia .
Bhutan and Guam entered the AFC qualification process , while Indonesia were disqualified after being suspended for political interference .
Qualifying was altered significantly from the 2014 method , with changes to the structure of the preliminary rounds – which were held before the main draw .
One home - and - away preliminary round reduced the 12 weakest entrants to 6 , which then joined the 34 strongest sides in 8 groups of 5 , with the winners and 4 best runners - up advancing to the final group stage , comprising two 6-team groups .
The winners and runners - up of the two final groups of 6 advanced to the World Cup finals with the two third - placed sides playing off in the fourth round for the right to play in an inter - confederation play - off for a final World Cup spot .
The first two rounds also acted as the qualifiers for the expanded 2019 AFC Asian Cup .
A total of 24 teams eliminated from World Cup qualification in the second round competed in the third round of 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification ( which was separate from the third round of 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification ) , where they were divided into six groups of four teams and competed for the remaining slots of the 2019 AFC Asian Cup .
The 24 teams consisted of the 16 highest ranked teams eliminated in the second round , and the eight teams that advanced from the play - off round of 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification which were contested by the remaining 12 teams eliminated in the second round .
EUROPE Section::::Europe .
The European qualification was unchanged from the 2010 system .
The 54 national teams were divided into nine groups of six teams , with the group winners qualifying directly to the finals , and the best eight runners - up playing home - and - away ties for the remaining four places .
With the admission of Gibraltar and Kosovo as FIFA members in May 2016 , both national teams made their debuts in World Cup qualifying .
With two groups of only five teams in the first round , Kosovo was assigned to group I as it was decided that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia should not play against Kosovo for security reasons , and Gibraltar was then added to group H. The Introduction of the new UEFA Nations League is likely to change the qualifying format .
although this is yet to be confirmed .
NORTH AND CENTRAL AMERICA AND CARIBBEAN
Section::::North and Central America and Caribbean .
The 2018 CONCACAF qualification process changed significantly from the 2014 qualification cycle .
The first three rounds had teams play home - and - away over two legs .
A first preliminary round involved the 14 lowest ranked teams and the seven winners advanced to the second round .
The 13 higher ranked sides received byes in the second round and were joined by the seven first round winners ; the ten winners advanced to the third round .
Two higher ranked teams received byes in the third round and were joined by ten second round winners ; the six winners advanced to the preliminary group stage .
As in 2014 , the remaining 12 teams played in 3 semifinal groups of 4 teams with the top two in each group advancing to a final six - team group .
The final round – often referred to as the " hexagonal " because there are six teams involved – saw the top three teams advance to the World Cup finals , while the fourth placed side entered an inter - confederation play - off for a final World Cup spot .
OCEANIA
Section::::Oceania .
Qualification in Oceania was held as part of a further competition .
The first stage took place with one group of four lowest ranked teams and the winner advanced to the second stage ( which also acted as the 2016 OFC Nations Cup ) .
In the second stage the top three teams advanced to the third round , among them Nations Cup champions New Zealand .
Two groups of three teams contested the third round , or final group stage , and the winners of each group entered a two - leg final .
The winners of this final advanced to an inter - confederation play - off for a World Cup spot .
SOUTH AMERICA Section::::South America .
As in recent qualification series CONMEBOL qualification consisted of a single group of all entrants .
Unlike previous qualifying tournaments where the fixtures were pre - determined , the fixtures were determined by a draw , which was held as part of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Preliminary Draw , on 25 July 2015 .
The top 4 teams from the 10-team group advanced to the World Cup finals , while the fifth placed team entered an inter - confederation play - off for a World Cup spot .
INTERCONTINENTAL PLAY - OFFS Section::::Intercontinental play - offs .
Like the previous 2014 tournament , the pairings for the two play - offs were determined by an open draw on 25 July 2015 , as part of the aforementioned preliminary draw .
Intercontinental play - offs are played as home - and - away ties .
QUALIFICATION TOURNAMENT RULES Section::::Qualification tournament rules .
Qualification tournaments generally consist of a number of stages , made up of groups or knock - out ties .
GROUPS Section::::Groups .
In all group tournaments , three points are awarded for a win , one for a draw , and none for a loss .
FIFA has set the order of the tie - breakers for teams that finish level on points : * goal difference in all group matches
* * greater number of goals scored in all group matches *
Where teams are still not able to be separated , the following tie - breakers are used : * greater number of points obtained in matches between the tied teams * * goal difference in matches between the tied teams * * greater number of goals scored in matches between the tied teams * Where teams are still equal , then a play - off on neutral ground , with extra time and penalties if necessary will be played if FIFA deems such a play - off able to be fitted within the coordinated international match calendar .
If this is not deemed feasible , then the result will be determined by the drawing of lot .
Note that this order of tie - breaker application has not always been applied .
While it was used in the 2010 qualifiers , the qualification for the 2006 World Cup used the head - to - head comparison prior to goal difference ( although this system was – where applicable – used in the 2006 finals themselves ) .
If these rules had applied in 2006 , then Nigeria would have qualified rather than Angola .
HOME - AND - AWAY
TIES Section::::Home - and - away ties .
Most knock - out qualifiers ( such as the inter - confederation play - offs , the second round of UEFA qualifying and many preliminary ties ) are played over two legs .
The team that scores a greater aggregate number of goals qualifies .
Away goals rule applies .
If these rules fail to determine the winner , extra time and penalty shootouts are used .
Occasionally – usually when one entrant lacks adequate facilities to host international matches – ties are played over a single leg , in which case matches level after 90 minutes will go to extra time and then to a penalty shootout if required .
Alternatively , " home " matches can be played in neutral countries , or occasionally one team will host both matches .
In the latter case the visiting team will still be considered as the " home " team for one of the legs – which may determine which side advances under the away goals rule , as occurred in CONCACAF qualification in 2010 .
