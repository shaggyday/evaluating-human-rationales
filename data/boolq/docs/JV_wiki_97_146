" Diane " is a hard - charging , empowering country pop track in which Cam sings about an affair to an unsuspecting wife once she realizes the man she was seeing is married .
Cam noted to Rolling Stone Country that the song is her " response to Dolly Parton 's ' Jolene . '
It 's the apology so many spouses deserve , but never get .
The other woman is coming forward to break the news to the wife about an affair , respecting her enough to have that hard conversation , once she realized he was married .
Because everyone should be able to decide their own path in life , based on the truth .
Women especially should do this for each other , since our self - worth can still be so wrapped up in our partners .
And in true country fashion , I 've set the whole raw story to upbeat music , so you can dance while you process it all . "
