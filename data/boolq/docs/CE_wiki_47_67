29ER ( BICYCLE )
29ers or two - niners are mountain bikes and hybrid bikes that are built to use 700c or 622 mm ISO ( inside rim diameter ) wheels , commonly called 29 " wheels .
Most mountain bikes once used ISO 559 mm wheels , commonly called 26 " wheels .
The ISO 622 mm wheel is typically also used for road - racing , trekking , cyclo - cross , touring and hybrid bicycles .
In some countries , mainly in Continental Europe , ISO 622 mm wheels are commonly called 28 " wheels or " 28 Incher " .
ORIGINS Section::::Origins .
29er rims have a diameter of and the average 29 " mountain bike tire is ( in ISO notation ) 59 - 622 – corresponding to an outside diameter of about .
The typical 26 " MTB tire has a rim diameter of and an outside tire diameter of about .
In the early 1980s , the size of the wheels for the emerging mountain bikes was undecided .
So when English off - road cycling pioneer Geoff Apps contacted Gary Fisher and Charlie Kelly with news that he had built a prototype off - road bicycle that used large - diameter 28 x 1¾ ( ISO 47 - 622 ) , 47 mm wide Nokian Hakkapeliitta snow tires from Finland , they were intrigued .
In a letter to the December 2006 issue of Bike Biz magazine , Gary Fisher , speaking about the growing popularity of 29ers , gives his perspective : " We got some tires from Geoff Apps really early on
and we [ Fisher and Kelly ] said ' Holy Toledo ! '
" But the poor supply situation of the larger diameter tires meant the fledgling MTB industry stuck with the smaller wheel size .
" The first Geoff Apps - designed 700C wheeled off - road bicycle was made in 1981 .
However the bicycle marketed as the Aventura by Apps ' own company , Cleland Cycles Ltd , between 1982 and 1984 used the more readily available Nokian Hakkapeliitta 26 × 2 ( ISO 54 - 584 ) .
The 650B size , also known as 27.5 " , reappeared in 2007 as a compromise between the 26 inch and 29 inch sizes .
The 650B size is called 27.5 " .
The name " 29er " comes from a bicycle called the Two Niner , which was offered by the Fisher bike company in 2001 , according to 1998 Mountain Bike Hall of Fame inductee Don Cook .
The US division of Bianchi Bicycles offered a line of 29 " wheeled off - road bikes beginning in 1991 called the Project bikes .
Their 1992 product catalog raved about the advantages of the larger wheels and showed three different bikes , the Project 3 , 5 and 7 .
Likewise , in 1991 Panaracer developed a 700c version of the Smoke Tire for OEM use on the Diamondback Overdrive and Overdrive Comp mountain bikes .
The original company Klein produced a small quantity of a 29 " wheeled version of their successful " Attitude " MTB racer , and named it the Adept .
It failed to find a market and was discontinued .
A key product release , the first true 29 " tire , was produced by an early supporter of the 29 " movement Wilderness Trail Bikes .
The company introduced the first true 29 " tire , the Nanoraptor , in 1999 .
At about the same time , White Brothers produced the first commercially available 29 " suspension forks .
Before then suspension forks used were forks designed for trekking bikes or hybrids .
For many years , 29 " frames and bikes were usually only available from small little - known manufactures like Niner Bikes .
Surly Bikes introduced their 29 " frameset , the Karate Monkey , in 2002 .
Gary Fisher Bicycles , a division of Trek Bicycles , became the first of the major manufactures to offer a line of 29 " bikes .
Their lines never sold well until the introduction of single - speed 29 " bike the Rig , in 2004 .
Today , most bicycle manufacturers in the US market offer at least one 29 " bicycle or frame .
Even companies that openly dismissed 29 " as a bad idea or passing trend , Specialized and Turner , are bringing 29 " wheels to market .
CYCLOCROSS COMPARISON Section::::Cyclocross comparison .
A tire with a tread width of less than in width is sometimes considered a cyclocross tire by 29 " enthusiasts , even though in cyclocross any tire wider than is not a cyclocross tire .
Although they are both intended for off road use , and typically use a 622 mm rim , cyclocross bikes and 29 " wheeled MTBs differ in their basic handling and geometry , construction methods , durability , and intended lifespan .
Bikes exist that blur the distinction by combining attributes of both , however .
One example of this is a Monstercross bike , often using a standard mountain bike frame intended for use with 26 " wheels with 700c wheels and 700 x 38c-45c tires , disc or cantilever brakes , MTB or cross gearing , and the drop bars of a cyclocross bike .
PERFORMANCE Section::::Performance .
The advantages and disadvantages of 29ers are often debated in the mountain bike community .
Disadvantages of the 29 " wheel include added weight , perceived sluggishness in handling , and problems with fit ( specifically , front wheel / toe overlap and high standover height ) .
Advantages include reduced rolling resistance , perceived increased stability while retaining quick handling , and an enhanced ability to roll over obstacles .
One item that is often raised is tire contact patch size and shape .
All else being equal , such as tire width , rim width , inflation pressure and rider weight , the contact patch of a 29 " wheel has the same area and is slightly longer ( ~5 % ) than that of a 26 " wheel .
ADVANTAGES
* Larger wheels roll over obstacles more easily .
The ability of a wheel to roll over obstacles is proportional to its size .
A 29 " wheel , which is about 10 % larger than a 26 " wheel , can roll over 10 % larger obstacles .
*
The larger diameter wheels have more angular momentum so they lose less speed to obstacles and rough sections but the same effect can be achieved with larger tires .
* 29 " bikes tend to offer taller riders a more " natural " frame geometry Section::::Advantages .
Most of these claims have yet to be objectively investigated .
Small scale , unpublished studies ( including one done by Pepperdine University , reportedly at the request of Gary Fisher ) exist but both proponents and detractors of 29 " wheels are generally unimpressed with their scientific rigor .
Long debates over how to conduct a " fair " test of the efficiency of 29 " vs 26 " mountain bikes have raged online , but no serious efforts have been made to conduct a large - scale , scientific study .
DRAWBACKS
* Increased wheel weight ( larger tire , tube , rim , and spokes ) makes the wheels slower to respond to acceleration and braking , and adds to unsprung mass .
* Longer spokes and decreased angle between hub flange and rim result in a more laterally flexible wheel ( ceteris paribus ) .
* Less responsive handling because of longer wheelbase and heavier front wheel .
* Smaller riders ( i.e. , less than 5'5 " ( = 165 cm ) tall ) may face significant geometry tradeoffs , possibly resulting in toe overlap , high handlebar height , and less standover clearance .
96 OR 69 VARIATIONS Section::::96 or 69 variations .
One variation is to have a 29 " front wheel and a 26 " rear wheel ( commonly called a " 96er " ) .
Using the smaller rear wheel allows shorter and quicker handling frames , more options for rear suspension designs and lighter bicycle weight .
Another variation is to have a 26 " front wheel with a 29 " rear wheel ( commonly called a " 69er " though Trek introduced a " 69er " in 2007 with a 29 " front wheel and a 26 " rear wheel ) .
