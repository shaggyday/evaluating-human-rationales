SUPREME GOVERNOR OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
The Supreme Governor of the Church of England is a title held by the British monarch that signifies titular leadership over the Church of England .
Although the monarch 's authority over the Church of England is largely ceremonial , the position is still very relevant to the church and is mostly observed in a symbolic capacity .
The Supreme Governor formally appoints high - ranking members of the church on the advice of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , who is in turn advised by church leaders .
HISTORY Section::::History .
By 1536 , Henry VIII had broken with Rome , seized the Church 's assets in England and declared the Church of England as the established church with himself as its head .
The Act of Supremacy 1534 confirmed the King 's status as having supremacy over the church and required the peers to swear an oath recognising Henry 's supremacy .
Henry 's daughter , Mary I , attempted to restore the English Church 's allegiance to the Pope and repealed the Act of Supremacy in 1555 .
Elizabeth
I ascended to the throne in 1558 and the next year Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy 1558 that restored the original act .
To placate critics , the Oath of Supremacy which peers were required to swear , gave the monarch 's title as Supreme Governor rather than Supreme Head of the church .
This wording avoided the charge that the monarchy was claiming divinity or usurping Christ , whom the Bible explicitly identifies as Head of the Church .
" Defender of the Faith " ( Fidei Defensor ) has been part of the English ( and since the Union of Scotland and England , British ) monarch 's title since Henry VIII was granted it by Pope Leo X in 1521 in recognition of Henry 's role in opposing the Protestant Reformation .
The pope withdrew the title , but it was later reconferred by Parliament in the reign of Edward VI .
THIRTY - NINE ARTICLES Section::::Thirty - Nine Articles .
This royal role is acknowledged in the Preface to the Thirty - Nine Articles of 1562 .
It states that : " Being by God 's Ordinance , according to Our just Title , Defender of the Faith and Supreme Governor of the Church , within these Our Dominions , We hold it most agreeable to this Our Kingly Office , and Our own religious zeal , to conserve and maintain the Church committed to Our Charge , in Unity of true Religion , and in the Bond of Peace ...
We have therefore , upon mature Deliberation , and with the Advice of so many of Our Bishops as might conveniently be called together , thought fit to make this Declaration following ...
That We are Supreme Governor of the Church of England ...
" Article 37 makes this claim to royal supremacy more explicit : " The Queen 's Majesty hath the chief power in this Realm of England , and other her Dominions , unto whom the chief Government of all Estates of this Realm , whether they be Ecclesiastical or Civil , in all causes doth appertain , and is not , nor ought to be , subject to any foreign Jurisdiction . ...
[ W]e give not to our Princes the ministering either of God 's Word , or of the Sacraments ... but only that prerogative , which we see to have been given always to all godly Princes in holy Scriptures by God himself ; that is , that they should rule all estates and degrees committed to their charge by God , whether they be Ecclesiastical or Temporal , and restrain with the civil sword the stubborn and evildoers .
The Bishop of Rome hath no jurisdiction in this Realm of England . "
CHURCH OF SCOTLAND Section::::Church of Scotland .
The British monarch vows to uphold the constitution of the Church of Scotland ( a Presbyterian national church ) , but does not hold a leadership position in it .
Nevertheless , the monarch appoints the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland as his or her personal representative , with a ceremonial role .
The Queen on occasion has filled the role personally , as when she opened the General Assembly in 1977 and 2002 ( her Silver and Golden Jubilee years ) .
