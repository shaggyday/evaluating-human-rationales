CHARACTER OVERVIEW Section::::Character overview .
Cabot first appears in the SVU episode " Wrong Is Right " , when she is hired to work with SVU as their permanent assistant district attorney ( ADA ) overseeing the legality of its arrests , following a rotating mix of ADAs , among them Abbie Carmichael ( Angie Harmon ) of the original Law & Order .
She is a graduate of Harvard Law School , and has an " uncle Bill " who is a federal judge .
While Cabot has great compassion for the victims of sexual assault , child sexual abuse and domestic violence whom she advocates for , her strict code of legal ethics often forces her to make harsh decisions and judgments that go against her personal feelings .
Her moral compass has earned her respect within the SVU squad .
She does occasionally bend the rules to suit her own notions of justice , but often with unpleasant results .
In one case , she is so determined to put serial child molester Roy Barnett ( Beau Gravitte ) in prison that she aggressively pressures one of his victims , Sam Cavanaugh ( Bret Harrison ) to testify , going so far as to threaten the boy with legal action if he does not comply .
Sam later attempts suicide , leaving him with severe brain damage and thus unable to testify .
She then lies to the detectives about having a search warrant for Sam 's home , which results in Barnett 's conviction on a technicality , but gets her in trouble with her superiors .
She is let off with a one - month suspension , but feels responsible for Sam 's plight .
Executive producer and head writer Neal Baer has said that an unaddressed sexual tension exists between Cabot and Detective Olivia Benson ( Mariska Hargitay ) .
Baer said , " We read the fan sites .
We know that people are into the Alex - Olivia thing .
All the codes are in there . "
When asked in a 2009 press call if Cabot and Benson were in love , March said , " I 'm not saying we 're not â€¦ I'm not saying we 're not in love . "

After three seasons , Cabot made her departure from SVU in the season - five episode " Loss " , in which she is prosecuting a rapist named Rafael Zapata Gaviria ( Jacinto Taras Riddick ) , who works for drug lord Cesar Velez .
Zapata had brutally raped and murdered an undercover NYPD officer who was working with the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) .
Cabot receives a threat on her life , as well as that of her mother .
Despite warnings from the rest of the SVU squad , Cabot continues to prosecute the case , unwilling to let Zapata scare her .
Tim Donovan ( Josh Hopkins ) , a key witness and DEA special agent , is murdered in a car bombing right before Cabot 's eyes .

In the following scene , a cold , quiet SVU squad room is shown with Stabler reading a newspaper proclaiming her death .
Benson and Stabler are called to a deserted area by federal agents , where Cabot emerges from the car .
She tells the stunned detectives that she had insisted on telling them the truth before disappearing into the Witness Protection Program .

She plays a tough but understanding supervisor to a young group of ADAs .
Her attitude and personality in this role were much different from those of the young ADA who prosecuted cases in SVU .
Cabot 's departure from witness protection and return to New York as a bureau chief was not explained during the show 's airing , as she was a last - minute addition to the cast and most of the early episodes had already been written before she was added .
Plans were made for later episodes to explain Cabot 's return to New York , plus a greater exploration of her personal life and past , but the cancellation of Conviction made this moot .
