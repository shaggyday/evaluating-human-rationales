Texas Arkansas
Total
I-30 is the shortest two - digit Interstate ending in zero in the Interstate system .
The Interstates ending in zero are generally the longest east – west Interstates .
It is also the second - shortest major Interstate ( ending in zero or five ) , behind I-45 .
The largest areas that I-30 travels through include the Dallas – Fort Worth metroplex , the Texarkana metropolitan area , and the Little Rock metropolitan area .
TEXAS Section::::Texas .
The section of I-30 between Dallas and Fort Worth is designated the Tom Landry Highway in honor of the long - time Dallas Cowboys coach .
Though I-30 passed well south of Texas Stadium , the Cowboys ' former home , their new stadium in Arlington , Texas is near I-30 .
However , the freeway designation was made before Arlington voted to build Cowboys Stadium .
This section was previously known as the Dallas - Fort Worth Turnpike , which preceded the Interstate System .
Although tolls had not been collected for many years , it was still known locally as the Dallas - Fort Worth Turnpike until receiving its present name .
The section from downtown Dallas to Arlington was recently widened to over 16 lanes in some sections , by 2010 .
From June 15 , 2010 , through February 6 , 2011 , this section of I-30 was temporarily designated as the " Tom Landry Super Bowl Highway " in commemoration of Super Bowl XLV which was played at Cowboys Stadium .
In Dallas , I-30 is known as East R.L. Thornton Freeway between downtown Dallas and the eastern suburb of Mesquite .
I-30 picks up the name from I-35E south at the Mixmaster interchange .
The Mixmaster is scheduled to be reconstructed as part of the Horseshoe project , derived from the larger Pegasus Project .
The section from downtown Dallas to Loop 12 ( Buckner Boulevard ) is eight lanes plus an HOV lane .
This section will be reconstructed under the East Corridor project to 12 lanes by 2025/2030 .
From Rockwall to a point past Sulphur Springs , I-30 runs concurrent with US 67 .
Through the city of Greenville , I-30 is known as Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway .
I-30 continues northeasterly through East Texas until a few miles from the Texas - Oklahoma border , when the route turns east , towards Arkansas .
ARKANSAS
Section::::Arkansas .
I-30
enters southwestern Arkansas in Texarkana which is the twin city of Texarkana , Texas .
I-30 intersects I-49 .
I-30 travels in a diagonal direction as it proceeds north east through the state .
I-30
then passes through Hope , birthplace of former President Bill Clinton .
I-30 then serves Prescott , Gurdon , Arkadelphia , and Malvern .
At Malvern , drivers can use US 70 or US 270 to travel into historic Hot Springs or beyond into Ouachita National Forest .
About at this location , US 70 and US 67 join I-30 and stay with the interstate into the Little Rock city limits .
Northeast of Malvern , I-30 passes through Benton , before reaching the Little Rock city limits .
From Benton to its end at I-40 , I-30 is a six - lane highway with up to 85,000 vehicles per day .
As I-30 enters Little Rock , I-430 leaves its parent route to create a western bypass of Little Rock .
Just south of downtown , I-30 meets the western terminus of I-440 and the northern terminus of another auxiliary route in I-530 .
I-530
travels south to Pine Bluff .
At this tri - intersection of Interstates , I-30 turns due north for the final few miles of its route .
Here I-30 passes through the capitol district of Little Rock .
I-30 also creates one final auxiliary route in I-630 , or the Wilbur D. Mills Freeway , which splits downtown Little Rock in an east – west direction before coming to its other end at I-430 just west of downtown .
After passing I-630 , I-30 crosses the Arkansas River into North Little Rock and comes to its eastern terminus , despite facing north , at I-40 .
At its end , I-30 is joined by US 65 , US 67 , and US 167 .
US 65 joins I-40 westbound , while US 67 and US 167 join I-40 eastbound from I-30 's eastern terminus .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The Dallas –
Fort Worth Turnpike was a toll highway in the Dallas - Fort Worth Metroplex .
It operated between 1957 and 1977 , afterward becoming a nondescript part of I-30 .
The road , three lanes in each direction but later widened , is the only direct connection between downtown Fort Worth and downtown Dallas , Texas .
In October 2001 , the former turnpike was named the Tom Landry Highway , after the late Dallas Cowboys coach Tom Landry .
The proposed expressway was studied as early as 1944 , but was turned down by the state engineer due to the expense .
However , in 1953 , the state legislature created the Texas Turnpike Authority , which in 1955 raised $ 58.5 million ( equivalent to $ in ) to build the project .
Construction started later that year .
On August 27 , 1957 , the highway was open to traffic , but the official opening came a week later on September 5 .
The turnpike 's presence stimulated growth in Arlington and Grand Prairie and facilitated construction of Six Flags Over Texas .
On December 31 , 1977 , the bonds were paid off and the freeway was handed over to the state Department of Transportation , toll collection ceased , and the tollbooths were removed during the following week .
It served as I-20 between Dallas and Fort Worth until the current I-20 route to the south was opened in 1971 .
Afterwards , I-30 was extended from its end at the " Dallas Mixmaster " interchange with I-35E ( also the east end of the turnpike ) to follow the turnpike , and the former I-20 in downtown Fort Worth , west to modern - day I-20 .
The existing US 67 route was already in heavy use in the early 1950s , at which point it was twinned from just east of Dallas to Rockwall and also near Greenville .
The DFW Turnpike linking Fort Worth to Dallas was completed by 1957 , becoming the first segment of I-30 .
The twinned US 67 routes were upgraded to Interstate Highway standards beginning in 1961 , forming the R.L. Thornton Freeway .
By the mid 1960s , much of I-30 was under construction .
The majority of the route was completed by 1965 , but a stretch through marshland between Mount Pleasant , Texas and New Boston , Texas remained unfinished .
This remaining segment was finally built and opened to traffic in 1971 , completing I-30 . I-30 was proposed to be extended along the US 67 freeway from Little Rock .
However , this conflicted with the Missouri Department of Transportation 's plan to extend I-57 , which is also planned to use US 67 .
In April 2016 , a provision designating US 67 from North Little Rock to Walnut Ridge , Arkansas , as " Future I-57 " was added into the federal fiscal year 2017 Transportation , Housing and Urban Development funding bill .
The provision would also give Arkansas the ability to request any segment of the road built to Interstate Highway standards be officially added to the Interstate Highway System as I-57 .
Had I-30 been extended , there were plans to upgrade AR 226 to Interstate standards and designate it as " Interstate 730 " .
I-130 was a proposed auxiliary route of I-30 that was planned to be concurrent with I-49 .
Once the eastern segment of the Texarkana Loop had been upgraded to Interstate standards , I-130 was to have been signed ; however , it is now part of I-49 .
