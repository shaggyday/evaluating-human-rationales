LIST OF POWER STATIONS IN MICHIGAN
This is a list of electricity - generating power stations in Michigan , sorted by type and name .
In 2010 , Michigan had a total summer capacity of 29,831 MW through all of its power plants .
Michigan 's energy mix in 2009 was 66 % coal , 22 % nuclear , 8 % natural gas and 3 % renewables but
coal use has rapidly decreased with natural gas and renewables increasing .
The leading source of renewable energy was wind power .
Michigan imports all of its coal and nuclear fuel and 82 % of its natural gas .
A requirement to produce 10 % of its electricity from in - state renewables by 2015 has led to the construction of new solar , wind and landfill gas plants .
Major electric companies in Michigan are Detroit Edison ( 11,000 MW ) and Consumers Power ( 9,000 MW ) .
In 2014 Michigan produced 50 % of its electricity from coal .
NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS Section::::Nuclear power stations .
Nuclear power is a significant source of electrical power in Michigan , producing roughly one - quarter of the state 's supply .
The three active nuclear power plants supply Michigan with about 30 % of its electricity . !

Coal power is the leading source of electricity in Michigan .
Although Michigan has no active coal mines , coal is easily moved from other states by train and across the Great Lakes by lake freighters .
The lower price of natural gas is leading to the closure of most coal plants with Consumer Energy planning to close all of its remaining coal plants by 2040 while DTE plans to retire 2100MW of coal power by 2023 . !

Michigan has some of its own natural gas production and is a leading state for natural gas transport and storage .
Declining prices for natural gas in the early 21st century led to an increase in the number of natural gas power plants .
Consumers Power announced a new 700 MW plant to be built near Flint beginning about 2015 while the city of Holland replaced its coal plant with a 114 MW natural gas plant In April 2018 , DTE received permission for a 1,100 MW natural gas plant to replace a coal plant in St. Clair . !
