It was produced by DJ Frank E , Charlie Puth , and Andrew Cedar .
Frank E and Puth were approached by their publishing company , Artist Publishing Group , to develop a melody that could pay tribute to the late Paul Walker for the film
Furious 7 ( 2015 ) .
His publishing company 's president Ben Maddahi then set up a first - time studio session for Puth with DJ Frank E at a studio in Los Angeles .
Puth became emotionally attached while writing the track , recalling Vail Cerullo , a friend of Puth 's time at Berklee College of Music , who perished in a motorcycle accident in 2012 .
He was at first reluctant that the film 's soundtrack label , Atlantic Records , would choose his vocal for the song .
In an interview with the Los Angeles Times , Puth recalled , " It just seemed to occur from out of nowhere .
And basically 10 minutes later Justin and
I wrote it
, we sent it off , and I thought we 'd never hear about it again . "
Puth and DJ Frank E 's output from the session was well received by Furious 7 filmmakers , Universal Pictures , and Atlantic .
As a result , the track was further commissioned to include rapped verses by Khalifa based on the subject of family , combined with Puth 's vocals and a piano melody .
The song then went through an extensive note - giving and production process .
Puth opined that his vocal was chosen by Atlantic because of his emotional attachment to the subject matter .
Puth revealed on The Talk that Universal originally wanted to get a more established singer to sing his part .

The song was chosen to be played at the end of the film .
