POWER OUTAGE
A power outage ( also called a power cut , a power out , a power blackout , power failure or a blackout ) is a short - term or a long - term loss of the electric power to a particular area .
There are many causes of power failures in an electricity network .
Examples of these causes include faults at power stations , damage to electric transmission lines , substations or other parts of the distribution system , a short circuit , or the overloading of electricity mains .
Power failures are particularly critical at sites where the environment and public safety are at risk .
Institutions such as hospitals , sewage treatment plants , mines , shelters and the like will usually have backup power sources such as standby generators , which will automatically start up when electrical power is lost .
Other critical systems , such as telecommunication , are also required to have emergency power .
The battery room of a telephone exchange usually has arrays of lead – acid batteries for backup and also a socket for connecting a generator during extended periods of outage .
TYPES OF POWER OUTAGE Section::::Types of power outage .
Power outages are categorized into three different phenomena , relating to the duration and effect of the outage :
* A permanent fault is a massive loss of power typically caused by a fault on a power line .
Power is automatically restored once the fault is cleared .
* A brownout is a drop in voltage in an electrical power supply .
The term brownout comes from the dimming experienced by lighting when the voltage sags .
Brownouts can cause poor performance of equipment or even incorrect operation .
*
A blackout is the total loss of power to an area and is the most severe form of power outage that can occur .
Blackouts which result from or result in power stations tripping are particularly difficult to recover from quickly .
Outages may last from a few minutes to a few weeks depending on the nature of the blackout and the configuration of the electrical network .
PROTECTING THE POWER SYSTEM FROM OUTAGES
Section::::Protecting the power system from outages .
In power supply networks , the power generation and the electrical load ( demand ) must be very close to equal every second to avoid overloading of network components , which can severely damage them .
Protective relays and fuses are used to automatically detect overloads and to disconnect circuits at risk of damage .
Under certain conditions , a network component shutting down can cause current fluctuations in neighboring segments of the network leading to a cascading failure of a larger section of the network .
This may range from a building , to a block , to an entire city , to an entire electrical grid .
Modern power systems are designed to be resistant to this sort of cascading failure , but it may be unavoidable ( see below ) .
Moreover , since there is no short - term economic benefit to preventing rare large - scale failures , researchers have expressed concern that there is a tendency to erode the resilience of the network over time , which is only corrected after a major failure occurs .
In a 2003 publication , Carreras and co - authors claimed that reducing the likelihood of small outages only increases the likelihood of larger ones .
In that case , the short - term economic benefit of keeping the individual customer happy increases the likelihood of large - scale blackouts .
The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing in October 2018 to examine " black start " , the process of restoring electricity after a system - wide power loss .
The hearing 's purpose was for Congress to learn about what the backup plans are in the electric utility industry in the case that the electric grid is damaged .
Threats to the electrical grid include cyberattacks , solar storms , and severe weather , among others .
For example , the " Northeast Blackout of 2003 " was caused when overgrown trees touched high - voltage power lines .
Around 55 million people in the U.S. and Canada lost power , and restoring it cost around $ 6 billion .
PROTECTING COMPUTER SYSTEMS FROM POWER OUTAGES Section::::Protecting computer systems from power outages .
Computer systems and other electronic devices containing logic circuitry are susceptible to data loss or hardware damage that can be caused by the sudden loss of power .
These can include data networking equipment , video projectors , alarm systems as well as computers .
To protect computer systems against this , the use of an uninterruptible power supply or ' UPS ' can provide a constant flow of electricity if a primary power supply becomes unavailable for a short period of time .
To protect against surges ( events where voltages increase for a few seconds ) , which can damage hardware when power is restored , a special device called a surge protector that absorbs the excess voltage can be used .
RESTORING POWER AFTER A WIDE - AREA OUTAGE Section::::Restoring power after a wide - area outage .
Restoring power after a wide - area outage can be difficult , as power stations need to be brought back on - line .
Normally , this is done with the help of power from the rest of the grid .
In the total absence of grid power , a so - called black start needs to be performed to bootstrap the power grid into operation .
The means of doing so will depend greatly on local circumstances and operational policies , but typically transmission utilities will establish localized ' power islands ' which are then progressively coupled together .
To maintain supply frequencies within tolerable limits during this process , demand must be reconnected at the same pace that generation is restored , requiring close coordination between power stations , transmission and distribution organizations .
BLACKOUT INEVITABILITY AND ELECTRIC SUSTAINABILITY SELF - ORGANIZED CRITICALITY Section::::Blackout inevitability and electric sustainability .
Section::::Self - organized criticality .
It has been argued on the basis of historical data and computer modeling that power grids are self - organized critical systems .
These systems exhibit unavoidable disturbances of all sizes , up to the size of the entire system .
This phenomenon has been attributed to steadily increasing demand / load , the economics of running a power company , and the limits of modern engineering .
While blackout frequency has been shown to be reduced by operating it further from its critical point , it generally is n't economically feasible , causing providers to increase the average load over time or upgrade less often resulting in the grid moving itself closer to its critical point .
Conversely , a system past the critical point will experience too many blackouts leading to system - wide upgrades moving it back below the critical point .
The term critical point of the system is used here in the sense of statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics , representing the point where a system undergoes a phase transition ; in this case the transition from a steady reliable grid with few cascading failures to a very sporadic unreliable grid with common cascading failures .
Near the critical point the relationship between blackout frequency and size follows a power - law distribution .
Other leaders are dismissive of system theories that conclude that blackouts are inevitable , but do agree that the basic operation of the grid must be changed .
The Electric Power Research Institute champions the use of smart grid features such as power control devices employing advanced sensors to coordinate the grid .
Others advocate greater use of electronically controlled high - voltage direct current ( HVDC ) firebreaks to prevent disturbances from cascading across AC lines in a wide area grid .
Cascading failure becomes much more common close to this critical point .
The power - law relationship is seen in both historical data and model systems .
The practice of operating these systems much closer to their maximum capacity leads to magnified effects of random , unavoidable disturbances due to aging , weather , human interaction etc .
While near the critical point , these failures have a greater effect on the surrounding components due to individual components carrying a larger load .
This results in the larger load from the failing component having to be redistributed in larger quantities across the system , making it more likely for additional components not directly affected by the disturbance to fail , igniting costly and dangerous cascading failures .
These initial disturbances causing blackouts are all the more unexpected and unavoidable due to actions of the power suppliers to prevent obvious disturbances ( cutting back trees , separating lines in windy areas , replacing aging components etc . ) .
The complexity of most power grids often makes the initial cause of a blackout extremely hard to identify .
OPA MODEL Section::::OPA model .
In 2002 , researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory ( ORNL ) , Power System Engineering Research Center of the University of Wisconsin ( PSerc ) , and the University of Alaska Fairbanks proposed a mathematical model for the behavior of electrical distribution systems .
This model has become known as the OPA model , a reference to the names of the authors ' institutions .
OPA is a cascading failure model .
Other cascading failure models include Manchester , Hidden failure , CASCADE , and Branching .
MITIGATION OF POWER OUTAGE
FREQUENCY Section::::Mitigation of power outage frequency .
The effects of trying to mitigate cascading failures near the critical point in an economically feasible fashion are often shown to not be beneficial and often even detrimental .
Four mitigation methods have been tested using the OPA blackout model :
* Increase critical number of failures causing cascading blackouts – Shown to decrease the frequency of smaller blackouts but increase that of larger blackouts .
* Increase individual power line max load – Shown to increase the frequency of smaller blackouts and decrease that of larger blackouts .
* Combination of increasing critical number and max load of lines – Shown to have no significant effect on either size of blackout .
The resulting minor reduction in the frequency of blackouts is projected to not be worth the cost of the implementation .
* Increase the excess power available to the grid – Shown to decrease the frequency of smaller blackouts but increase that of larger blackouts .
In addition to the finding of each mitigation strategy having a cost - benefit relationship with regards to frequency of small and large blackouts , the total number of blackout events was not significantly reduced by any of the above - mentioned mitigation measures .
A complex network - based model to control large cascading failures ( blackouts ) using local information only was proposed by A. E. Motter .
One of the proposed solutions proposed to reduce the impact of power outage was introduced by M. Saleh .
