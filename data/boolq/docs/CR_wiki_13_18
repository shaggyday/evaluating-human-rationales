ROLLED OATS Rolled oats are traditionally oat groats that have been dehusked and steamed , before being rolled into flat flakes under heavy rollers and stabilized by being lightly toasted .
Rolled oats that are sold as
porridge oats usually have had the tough bran removed .
They have often , but not always , been lightly baked or pressure - cooked or " processed " in some fashion .
Thick - rolled oats are large whole flakes , and thin - rolled oats are smaller , fragmented flakes .
Oat flakes that are simply rolled whole oats without further processing can be cooked into a porridge and eaten as " old - fashioned " oats , but more highly fragmented and processed rolled oats absorb water much more easily and therefore cook faster into a porridge , so they are sometimes called " quick " or " instant " oats .
Rolled oats are most often the main ingredient in granola and muesli .
Rolled oats can be further processed into coarse powder , which , when cooked , becomes a thick broth .
Finer oatmeal powder is often used as baby food .
PROCESS
Section::::Process .
The oat , like other cereals , has a hard , inedible outer husk that must be removed before the grain can be eaten .
After the outer husk ( or chaff ) has been removed from the still bran - covered oat grains , the remainder is called oat groats .
Since the bran layer , though nutritious , makes the grains tough to chew and contains an enzyme that can cause the oats to go rancid , raw oat groats are often further steam - treated to soften them for a quicker cooking time ( modern " quick oats " ) and to denature the enzymes for a longer shelf life .
STEEL - CUT OATS Section::::Steel - cut oats .
Steel - cut or pinhead oats are oat groats that have been chopped into smaller pieces before any steaming and thus retain bits of the bran layer .
PREPARATION Section::::Preparation .
Rolled oats can be eaten without further heating or cooking : The oats are soaked for 1â€“6 hours in water - based liquid , such as water or fruit juice .
The soak duration depends on shape , size and pre - processing technique , saving the time and the energy spent on heating , preserving its taste , and saving its nutritional values destroyed during cooking .
Traditionally , oat groats are a whole grain that can be used as a breakfast cereal , just like the various forms of oatmeal , rolled oats and pinhead oats can be cooked to make porridge .
Rolled oats are used in granola , muesli , oatcakes , and flapjacks .
NUTRIENTS
Section::::Nutrients .
Whole oats are an excellent source of thiamine , iron , and dietary fiber .
Whole oats are also the only source of antioxidant compounds known as avenanthramides ; these are believed to have properties which help to protect the circulatory system from arteriosclerosis .
Oat products also contain beta - glucan .
