SERIES
OVERVIEW PLOT Section::::Plot .
Lux Cassidy ( Britt Robertson ) has been through the foster care system for almost her whole life .
Cate Cassidy ( Shiri Appleby ) gave birth to her at 16 but gave her up for adoption after Social Services promised her that the baby would be adopted quickly .
But the baby had heart problems ( ventricular septal defect ) and needed countless surgeries , so she was not a desirable candidate for adoption and ended up in the foster - care system and group homes .
Just before her 16th birthday , Lux petitions a court to become an emancipated minor , but she learns that she must get signatures from her unknown birth parents .
She locates her father , Nate Bazile ( Kristoffer Polaha ) , who operates the Open Bar inside a building his father gave him .
"
Baze " lives like an overgrown frat boy above the bar with two roommates : his childhood best friend Math ( Austin Basis ) , a high - school teacher ; and Jamie ( Reggie Austin ) , who also works at the bar .
However , even when he signs the papers , Baze discovers that he is already bonding with his newfound daughter , and realizes that she has his eyes .
Baze introduces Lux to her mother Cate Cassidy , co - host of the " Morning Madness " drive time show at Portland radio station K-100 and Baze 's former one - night stand from high school .
Lux has been listening to Cate 's voice on the radio for as long as she can remember , so she feels an instant connection to the mom
she 's never met .
Baze takes Lux to meet Cate , who is shocked and saddened to learn that Lux has grown up in foster care instead of the real adoptive home she had been promised her baby would have , and she 's reluctant to commit to her daughter .
Eventually Cate wants to be a part of Lux 's life , and she shows that she really does care .
When a judge decides that Lux is n't ready for emancipation and unexpectedly grants temporary joint custody to Baze and Cate , they agree to try to get past the awkwardness .
Because of her radio - host job and suitable house , Cate is given primary custody of Lux .
Ryan Thomas ( Kerr Smith ) , her radio - broadcast partner and fianc√© , also bonds with Lux and is sometimes better able to reach her than her parents , because he 's faced issues similar to hers .
As the series progresses , Baze becomes more responsible and works harder to get the bar and the loft apartment in shape
so it 's fit for Lux to stay with him sometimes ; eventually he sets aside a corner of the loft for her bedroom .
Their close bond is causing slacker - esque Baze to prove that he can come through for Lux and provide support and love .
As for Cate , she constantly disappoints Lux , but she does mean well , and Alice ( Erin Karpluk ) , producer of her radio show , often serves as her much - needed confidante .
Ryan breaks up with Cate , but eventually they reconcile and the engagement is back on .
He also relents a bit towards Baze after the two have drinks and Baze explains that all he is to Cate is Lux 's father .
But by the series ' send , Baze and Ryan are good friends .
Baze 's bar is owned by his father Jack ( Robin Thomas ) , who considers Baze a disappointment , but softens towards him somewhat in later episodes , due to Lux 's entrance in their lives .
Baze himself later buys the bar .
Also seen is Cate 's four - times - divorced mother , who had convinced Cate to give up Lux ; and Baze 's level - headed , understanding mother Ellen ( Susan Hogan ) .
Both love Lux when they meet her , though Ellen seems to have the stronger grandmotherly bond with her .
Lux had been attending Longfellow High , a rough high school in Portland , but Cate enrolls her at Westmonte High , the alma mater of herself , Baze , and Math , and the institution at which Math currently teaches .
At first infuriated , Lux soon adapts and makes friends , among them popular Jones Mager ( Austin Butler ) who is the quarterback like her father was .
Meanwhile , she wonders how friends from her old life might fit into her new one .
Tasha Siviac has been her best friend since she was seven ( they met at Sunnyvale , the foster - care home ) , and Lux hopes to stay in touch with her , her boyfriend Gavin , and
Lux 's own first boyfriend Bug , who has been in trouble with the law ; this might imperil Lux 's new life with Baze and Cate .
Lux 's longtime social worker Fern Redmund is instrumental in helping Cate and Baze get their parental rights reinstated and helping the three become an official family .
Fern thus becomes a family friend .
At various times Baze incurs Cate 's wrath by sleeping with Cate 's younger sister , Lux 's Aunt Abby , a neurotic therapist and yoga practitioner .
Baze also sleeps with Ryan 's sister Paige after a drunk incident in season two .
Lux meets a young man , Eric Daniels , at Baze 's bar ; after she goes on a date with him she discover that he is her new teacher .
The second season deals with this affair , which ends when Eric leaves town when Cate and Baze threaten to call the police if he does n't resign his job and leave Portland ; Cate and Ryan 's new marriage and attempts to conceive ; and Baze 's relationship with coworker Emma Bradshaw who has a son , Sam .
Later Tasha becomes more a part of the family 's life after she strikes out on her own .
Bug and Gavin disappear , Bug having left town after Lux rejected his marriage proposal .
Cate miscarried her child with Ryan because of a condition she developed after having Lux .
Lux being the only child she would ever have created a stronger bond between mother and daughter , and Lux finally realizes that she has a real mom who loves her and wo n't let anything or anyone harm her .
After nearly giving in to desire , Baze breaks up with Emma after learning from Lux that Emma had had an affair with his dad .
It did n't happen when Baze was going out with her , but it meant his dad cheating on his mother , and he decided that he could never be with Emma without thinking of his father .
The show then fast - forwards two years to Lux delivering the commencement speech at her graduation .
It is revealed that Ryan and Julia are together and have a young son from their affair , and that Baze and Cate are finally together as a couple .

Creator Liz Tigelaar came up with the idea for the show in 2007 and developed it with director Gary Fleder .
Tigelaar and Fleder pitched the show , then titled Light Years , to ABC Studios who accepted it .

The pilot was filmed in January 2009 , being written by Tigelaar and directed by Fleder .
Both also served as executive producers .
The CW announced the series in January 2009 under the working title of Light Years because the main character Lux 's name means Light .
According to Tigelaar , the title " tested way too sci - fi " and it was changed to LUX ( the name of one of the lead characters ) in April .
This was quickly changed again into Life Unexpected , but at The CW Upfronts in May , the series was promoted as Parental Discretion Advised .
That June , the network reverted to the name Life UneXpected , again highlighting the name of the main character in capital letters .
Initial advertising for the series in fall 2009 listed it without the capitalized " X " , which became the final version as it appears now .
