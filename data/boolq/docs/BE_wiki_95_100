DEATH BY NATURAL CAUSES
A death by natural causes , as recorded by coroners and on death certificates and associated documents , is the end result of an illness or an internal malfunction of the body not directly caused by external forces , typically due to old age .
This is especially true when an elderly person has several different conditions or diseases , but where it appears that none of them alone or together may clearly lead to the death , and it is uncertain which condition was the final factor causing death .
For example , a person dying from complications from influenza ( an infection ) , a heart attack ( an internal body malfunction ) , or sudden heart failure would be listed as having died from natural causes .
Health departments discourage listing old age as the cause of death because doing so does not benefit public health or medical research .
Old age is not a scientifically recognized cause of death ; there is always a more direct cause , although it may be unknown in certain cases and could be one of a number of aging - associated diseases .
TERMINOLOGY Section::::Terminology .
By contrast , death caused by active intervention is called unnatural death .
The " unnatural " causes are usually given as accident ( implying no unreasonable voluntary risk ) ,
misadventure ( an accident following a willful and dangerous risk , which can include drug or alcohol overdose ) , suicide , or homicide .
In some settings , other categories may be added .
For example , a prison may track the deaths of inmates caused by acute intoxication separately .
Additionally , a cause of death can be recorded as " undetermined " .
