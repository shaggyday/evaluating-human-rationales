AEGOPODIUM PODAGRARIA
Aegopodium podagraria ( commonly called ground elder , herb gerard , bishop 's weed , goutweed , gout wort , and snow - in - the - mountain , and sometimes called English masterwort and wild masterwort ) is a perennial plant in the carrot family ( Apiaceae ) that grows in shady places .
The name " ground elder " comes from the superficial similarity of its leaves and flowers to those of elder ( Sambucus ) , which is unrelated .
It is the type species of the genus Aegopodium .
This species is native to Eurasia , and has been introduced around the world as an ornamental plant , where it occasionally poses an ecological threat as an invasive exotic plant .
DESCRIPTION Section::::Description .
A. podagraria is perennial , growing to a height of with rhizomes .
The stems are erect , hollow and grooved .
The upper leaves are ternate , broad and toothed .
The flowers are in umbels , terminal with 15 to 20 rays , with small white flowers .
The fruits are small and have long curved styles .
The flowers are visited by many types of insects , thus being characterised by a generalised pollination system .
DISTRIBUTION Section::::Distribution .
Generally distributed in Ireland and Great Britain .
INVASIVE HABIT Section::::Invasive habit .
Seed dispersal and seedling establishment is typically limited by shading , and new establishments from seed are restricted to disturbed areas .
However , Aegopodium podagraria readily spreads over large areas of ground by underground rhizomes .
Once established , the plants are highly competitive , also in shaded environments , and can reduce the diversity of ground cover , and prevent the establishment of tree and shrub seedlings .
Because of its limited seed dispersal ability , short - lived seed bank and seedling recruitment , the primary vector for dispersal to new areas are human plantings as an ornamental , medicinal or vegetable plant , as well as by accidentally spreading rhizomes by dumping of garden waste .
It spreads rapidly under favorable growing conditions .
Because of this it has been described as a nuisance species , and been labeled one of the " worst " garden weeds in perennial flower gardens .
STATUS AS AN INVASIVE EXOTIC PLANT Section::::Status as an invasive exotic plant .
A. podagraria has been introduced around the world , including in North America , Australia , New Zealand , and Japan , most commonly as an ornamental plant .
It readily establishes and can become naturalized in boreal , moist - temperate , and moist - subtropical climates .
It is an " aggressive " invader in the upper Great Lakes region and northeastern North America , Australia , Tasmania , and New Zealand .
It can pose an ecological threat due to its invasive nature , with potential to crowd out native species .
Because of its potential impacts on native communities and the difficulty of its control , it has been banned or restricted in some jurisdictions outside its native range , including in Connecticut , Massachusetts , Wisconsin ( see Administrative Code NR 40 ) , and Vermont in the USA .
CONTROL Section::::Control .
Once established , goutweed is difficult to eradicate .
The smallest piece of rhizome left in the ground will quickly form a sturdy new plant .
All - green goutweed may be more persistent and spread more rapidly than ornamental , variegated goutweed varieties , making the all - green type particularly difficult to control .
And all - green , wild type forms are known to reappear from seeds of variegated varieties .
Integrative management strategies that combine herbicide with landscape cloth , bark mulch , and hand weeding to control goutweed in a garden are largely unsuccessful because sprouting occurs from either rhizomes or root fragments left in the soil .
Hand pulling , raking , and digging followed by monitoring to control goutweed may be effective ; however , caution must be taken to remove the entire rhizome and root system .
Removing flowers before seed set may help control the spread of goutweed .
Because goutweed 's starch reserves are typically depleted by spring , removal of leaves in spring could be effective in starving the plant .
Once goutweed has been removed , the patch should be carefully monitored periodically for a few years .
New shoots should be dug up and destroyed .
Revegetation with other plant materials is recommended .
The most effective means of control is to prevent its establishment in natural communities .
It is thus recommended to plant goutweed only on sites not adjacent to wildlands and in gardens where root spread can be restricted ( e.g. , between a sidewalk and a house ) .
ORNAMENTAL USE Section::::Ornamental use .
A variegated form is grown as an ornamental plant , though with the advice to keep it isolated .
IMPORTANCE TO WILDLIFE Section::::Importance to wildlife .
In Eurasia , it is used as a food plant by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera , including dot moth , grey dagger and grey pug , although A. podagraria is not the exclusive host to any of these species .
USES AS FOOD AND MEDICINE Section::::Uses as food and medicine .
The tender leaves have been used in antiquity and throughout the Middle Ages as a spring leaf vegetable , much as spinach was used .
Young leaves are preferred as a pot herb .
It is best picked from when it appears ( as early as February in the UK ) to just before it flowers ( May to June ) .
If it is picked after this point , it takes on a pungent taste and has a laxative effect .
However , it can be stopped from flowering by pinching out the flowers , ensuring the plant remains edible if used more sparingly as a pot herb .
It also had a history as a medicinal herb to treat gout and arthritis , applied in hot wraps externally upon boiling both leaves and roots together .
Ingested , the leaves have a diuretic effect and act as a mild sedative .
Its use as a medicinal herb has largely declined during the modern era .
The plant is said to have been introduced into Great Britain by the Romans as a food plant and into Northern Europe as a medicinal herb by monks .
It is still found growing in patches surrounding many monastic ruins in Europe , and descriptions of its use are found among monastic writings , such as in Physica by Hildegard von Bingen .
