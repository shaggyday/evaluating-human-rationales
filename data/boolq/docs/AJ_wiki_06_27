HISTORY
BRINGING THE NHL TO NASHVILLE Section::::History .
Section::::Bringing the NHL to Nashville .
In late 1995 , rumors began to circulate that the New Jersey Devils would be relocating to the planned Nashville Arena .
Nashville offered a $ 20 million relocation bonus to any team that would relocate , and the Devils attempted to terminate their lease with the NJSEA before ultimately restructuring it to stay in New Jersey .
After the attempt to get the Devils , NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman stated Nashville would probably be considered in upcoming expansion .
The arena was opened in 1996 , and after an attempt to bring the National Basketball Association 's Sacramento Kings did not materialize , the city instead went after a hockey team .
In January 1997 , a group led by Wisconsin businessman Craig Leipold made a formal presentation before the NHL requesting an expansion franchise .
When Bettman and league officials visited Nashville to tour the arena , thousands gathered on the arena plaza to greet them .
In June , the league granted conditional franchises to Nashville , Columbus , Ohio , Atlanta and Minneapolis – Saint Paul .
The Nashville team would be scheduled to begin play in 1998 if they met the NHL requirement of selling 12,000 season tickets before March 31 , 1998 .
Of the four cities , Nashville was the only one with a completed arena and therefore began play first .
One month later , Leipold named former Washington Capitals general manager David Poile as the franchise 's first general manager .
Portland Pirates ' head coach Barry Trotz was named the franchise 's first head coach on August 6 .
On September 25 , 1997 , Leipold and team president Jack Diller held a press conference where they unveiled the franchise 's new logo , a saber - toothed cat ( Smilodon floridanus ) .
The logo was a reference to a partial Smilodon skeleton found beneath downtown Nashville in 1971 during construction of the First American National Bank building , now the UBS Tower .
Once the logo was unveiled , the franchise held a vote among fans to choose a name .
Three candidates were culled from 75 : " Ice Tigers , " " Fury " and " Attack . "
Leipold added his own submission to the vote , " Predators . "
On November 13 , Leipold revealed at a press conference that his submission had won out and that the new franchise would be known as the " Nashville Predators . "
When awarded a franchise , the city of Nashville paid 31.50 % of the $ 80 million fee to join the league .
The city has engaged an affiliate of the team to operate the arena , and that agreement protects the city against annual arena operating losses over approximately $ 3.8 million .
The $ 15 million payroll of the team was the lowest of the NHL .
EARLY YEARS ( 1998–2005 )
Section::::Early years ( 1998–2005 ) .
The Predators began play during the 1998–99 season , taking to the ice for the first time on October 10 , 1998 , where they lost 1–0 at home to the Florida Panthers .
It was the only sold out game of the Predators ' first five bouts in Nashville .
Three nights later , on October 13 , they defeated the Carolina Hurricanes 3–2 for their first win .
Forward Andrew Brunette scored the first goal .
The Predators , in their first year of existence , finished second - to - last in the Western Conference with a 28–47–7 record .
In the 1999–2000 season , the Predators finished with a similar record to the previous season , and finished last in the Western Conference behind the Calgary Flames .
However , during a game versus the New York Islanders on February 20 , 2000 , the Predators scored four goals in 3 minutes and 38 seconds .
To begin the 2000–01 season , the Predators played two games in Japan against the Pittsburgh Penguins .
Each team won a game in front of the largest crowds ever to see a hockey game in Japan .
Backed by the goaltending duo of Mike Dunham and Tomas Vokoun , Nashville finished the season in tenth place in the Western Conference , ten points out of a playoff spot with a total of 80 total points .
During the 2001–02 season , the Predators recorded their 100th victory on December 6 , 2001 .
With that win , Nashville became the second - fastest expansion team of the 1990s to reach the 100-win plateau .
In the 2002–03 season , head coach Barry Trotz broke the record for most games coached by the original coach of an expansion team ( 392 games ) .
The club had failed to qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs for their first five years as a franchise .
However , in the 2003–04 season , the Predators finished eighth in the Western Conference , qualifying for their first post - season berth .
The Predators were eliminated by the Detroit Red Wings in six games in the first round of the 2004 Stanley Cup playoffs .
The following 2004–05 season was wiped out by a labor dispute between NHL owners and players .
AFTER THE LOCKOUT ( 2005–2014 ) Section::::After the lockout ( 2005–2014 ) .
In the 2005–06 season , the Predators set an NHL record by winning their first four games by one goal
each ( although two of those were shootout victories , which would have been tie games in previous seasons ) .
They also became only the fourth NHL franchise to start the season 8–0 ; the last time a team did so was the Toronto Maple Leafs , who set the mark with a 10–0 start in the 1993–94 season .
The Predators set the franchise mark for wins in a season with a 2–0 shutout of the Phoenix Coyotes on March 16 , 2006 .
In that match , Chris Mason became the ninth goaltender to score a goal .
By the end of the season , the Predators had accumulated 106 points — their first 100-point season — and clinched home ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs for the first time in team history .
They finished the season with an NHL - best 32–8–1 record at home .
However , the Predators would be eliminated by the San Jose Sharks in five games in the first round of the 2006 playoffs .
During the off - season , the Predators acquired veteran center Jason Arnott from free agency on July 2 , 2006 .
In the following season , Arnott and David Legwand led the team in goals with 27 each .
Late in the season , the Predators traded two former first round draft picks , Scottie Upshall and Ryan Parent , plus their first and third - round pick in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft , to the Philadelphia Flyers for five - time NHL All - Star Peter Forsberg .
The Predators finished the season ranked fourth in the Western Conference with a franchise record 110 points , finishing third overall behind the Buffalo Sabres and the Red Wings .
They were defeated by the Sharks in the first round of the 2007 playoffs for the second year in a row , losing the series 4–1 .
The roster saw a depletion in talent during the off - season .
With multiple potential buyers , and rumors of the franchise moving hounding the team until almost mid - season , the Predators were not expected to be successful during the 2007–08 season .
Chris Mason , former backup goaltender to Tomas Vokoun ( who was traded to the Florida Panthers ) had a shaky season and shared net - minding duties with Dan Ellis .
Ellis , who was signed from the Dallas Stars before the season began , had a 233:39 long shutout streak ( fifth longest in league history ) nearing the end of the season that helped Nashville attain the eighth playoff spot with 91 points .
The Predators met the Presidents ' Trophy - winning ( and eventual Stanley Cup winners )
Red Wings in the first round of the playoffs and were defeated 4–2 , their fourth - straight first - round knockout .
NEW OWNERSHIP GROUP Section::::New ownership group .
The first off - season of settling in under new ownership was a quiet one for the Predators with little personnel movement .
As such , the Predators began the 2008–09 season with little expectation .
Following a strong push after the All - Star break and no movement at the trade deadline , the team found themselves still battling for a playoff spot into the last week of the season .
Buoyed by the return of Steve Sullivan after almost two seasons recovering from a back injury , the Predators finished with 88 points , settling for tenth place in the Western Conference , missing the playoffs for the first time in five seasons .
The Predators made few major additions to their roster in the 2009 off - season , signing former San Jose Sharks forward Marcel Goc ( who was extended for another year by the club in mid - season ) and former Montreal Canadiens defenseman Francis Bouillon .
The 2009–10 season also saw the much - anticipated debut of top prospect Colin Wilson .
However , due to a groin injury suffered in training camp , Wilson spent the first week - and - a - half of the season on the sidelines , and was sent to the Milwaukee Admirals of the American Hockey League ( AHL ) in November .
He returned to the club in February and scored 11 points in his next 15 games and finished the season with 15 points in 35 games .
2010 also saw a breakout year for the last pick in the 2005 Draft , Patric Hornqvist , as the 23-year - old Swede scored 30 in the 2009–10 season , becoming the fourth Predator to do so ( the others being Steve Sullivan , Paul Kariya and Jason Arnott ) .
The Predators qualified for the 2010 playoffs , facing the Chicago Blackhawks in the first round .
The Predators earned their first postseason road win on April 16 , 2010 when they beat the Blackhawks 4–1 at the United Center , although they lost the overall series in six games .
On July 9 , 2010 , the Predators announced that defenseman Shea Weber would become the club 's fifth captain .
In the following years ' playoffs , the Predators advanced to the second round of the playoffs for the first time in franchise history .
They defeated the Anaheim Ducks in the first round , winning the fourth game of the series at Bridgestone Arena on April 24 , 2011 .
Two days prior , Predators ' goaltender Pekka Rinne was nominated as a Vezina Trophy finalist for his performance during the 2010–11 season .
The Predators played against the number - one ranked team in the NHL in the second round , the Vancouver Canucks .
The Predators lost the series 4–2 .
On June 22 , 2011 , the Predators unveiled their modified logo set for the 2011–12 season .
With the color scheme simplified to blue , gold and white and eliminating orange , silver and steel , the Predators cleaned up their primary logo and wordmark .
A new alternate logo incorporating elements from a guitar pick and the Tennessee state flag was also introduced .
In the beginning of the 2011–12 season , on November 3 , 2011 , the Predators signed goaltender Pekka Rinne to a seven - year , $ 49 million deal .
It was the largest contract awarded in Predators ' history , as well as making Rinne the highest paid goaltender in the NHL that year .
On February 27 , 2012 , during the NHL 's trade deadline , the Predators acquired Andrei Kostitsyn and Paul Gaustad from the Montreal Canadiens and the Buffalo Sabres , respectively .
The Predators surrendered draft picks to bolster their team for the 2012 playoffs .
The season also saw the return of Russian forward Alexander Radulov to the Predators after a four - year hiatus to play in the Kontinental Hockey League ( KHL ) .
For the second year in a row , and the second time in the team 's history , the Predators won a first - round series in the Stanley Cup playoffs , defeating the Red Wings in a best - of - seven series 4–1 .
However , for the second year in a row , the Predators were ousted in the Western Conference second round , this time to the Phoenix Coyotes .
The following 2012–13 season as a result of the 2012–13 NHL lockout .
The Predators failed to qualify for the playoffs in the shortened season , the first time they failed to do so since the 2008 - 09 season .
After the season , the Predators signed Weber through a front - loaded $ 110 million , 14-year offer sheet , $ 68 million of it as a signing bonus , from the Philadelphia Flyers on July 19 .
The offer sheet was the richest in NHL history in terms of total money , money per season , and length , surpassing the previous offer sheet record set by Thomas Vanek .
The following season saw the departure of center David Legwand , the first player ever drafted by the Predators , the club 's all - time leading scorer , and was co - leading scorer for the season at the time .
Agreeing to waive his " no - trade clause " , he was traded on March 5 , 2014 , to his hometown team , the Detroit Red Wings , in exchange for prospect forward Calle Jarnkrok , forward Patrick Eaves and a third - round pick in the upcoming 2014 NHL Entry Draft .
After missing the playoffs for a second season in a row , the Predators opted not to renew the contract of Barry Trotz as its head coach after 15 years , although he was offered an unnamed position within the organization .
On May 6 , 2014 , the Predators announced Peter Laviolette as their new head coach .
PETER LAVIOLETTE ERA ( 2014–PRESENT )
Section::::Peter Laviolette era
( 2014–present ) .
In Peter Laviolette 's first season as the Predators ' head coach , the Predators finished second in the Central Division .
Despite having home advantage in the first round of the 2015 playoffs , they lost the first round in six games to the Chicago Blackhawks , who went on to win the Stanley Cup .
For the following 2015–16 season , the Predators finished as the Western Conference 's first wild - card , earning 96 points .
When they advanced to the second - round after beating the Anaheim Ducks in Game 7 , it was the franchise 's first seven - game series and seven - game series win .
They were eliminated in seven games by the San Jose Sharks , who went on to win the conference .
In the 2016 off - season , on June 29 , 2016 , the Predators traded Weber to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for defenseman P. K. Subban .
The trade surprised many hockey fans because the details to this trade were kept strictly confidential until the deal was already made .
On September 7 , 2016 , the Predators announced Mike Fisher would replace Weber as the sixth captain of the club .
In the 2016–17 season , the Predators finished fourth in the Central Division with 94 points , which earned them the second wild card spot in the Western Conference .
The 2016–17 season marked the first time the Predators sold out all 41 regular season home games .
Their eighth - place finish in the conference gave them a first - round Stanley Cup playoff matchup against the Chicago Blackhawks , who finished first in the conference during the regular season .
The Predators swept the Blackhawks in four games .
This was the first time that an eighth seed swept a playoff series against the top seed in the conference in NHL history as well as the first time that there had been a sweep by an eighth seed against a top seed in a best - of - seven playoff series in the history of North American major league professional sports .
In the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs , the Predators defeated the St. Louis Blues in six games , marking the first time the team advanced to the Western Conference Finals .
On May 16 , the Predators became the first team in 20 years ( since the Detroit Red Wings in 1997 ) to achieve ten - straight wins at home in the postseason .
On May 22 , 2017 the Predators defeated the Anaheim Ducks 6–3 and won the series four games to two , winning the Western Conference , and advancing to the club 's first Stanley Cup Finals .
In the Finals , the Predators went down 2–0 against the Penguins , although the Predators battled back and evened the series at two , winning Games 3 and 4 at home .
Returning to Pittsburgh , the Predators lost 6–0 before being eliminated at home 2–0 in game 6 of the Finals .
On April 5 , 2018 , the Predators clinched their first division title in team history while also claiming their first Presidents ' Trophy .
They defeated the Colorado Avalanche in the first round of the playoffs in six games , and then lost to the Winnipeg Jets in seven games in the second round .
TEAM
INFORMATION FACILITIES Section::::Team information .
Section::::Facilities .
The Nashville Predators have played their home games at Bridgestone Arena since their inaugural season in 1998 .
Opened in 1996 , Bridgestone Arena is a multi - purpose venue in downtown Nashville .
The Predators ' practice facility is located at Centennial Sportsplex , a multi - use athletic complex located next to Centennial Park .
Both facilities are owned by the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County .
FAN TRADITIONS Section::::Fan traditions .
Fans of the Nashville Predators have modified the octopus - throwing tradition of Detroit Red Wings fans to show their support : on occasion , a fan will throw a catfish onto the ice .
The Tennessean newspaper of Nashville cites the first instance of this as being on October 30 , 2003 .
On May 16 , 2017 , during Game 3 of the Western Conference Final at Bridgestone Arena , country music singer , songwriter , and record producer Keith Urban , who had performed the National Anthem prior to the game , was seen on the Jumbotron hoisting a massive catfish that Tennessee Titans left tackle , Taylor Lewan had with him at the game .
Lewan , along with fellow Titans offensive linemen Jack Conklin , Quinton Spain , Ben Jones , and Josh Klein , and Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota , served as the hype men prior to the game , another Predators playoff tradition prior to home games , which included them waving gold Predators towels , Mariota encouraging the crowd to get louder , Lewan hoisting the catfish , and the offensive linemen chugging beer .
Section 303 is where a section of fans at the Bridgestone Arena sit , stand , and cheer , colloquially known as The Cellblock .
The group refers to themselves as " the loudest section of the loudest arena in the NHL .
" The fan - based organization has been recognized by the Predators ' front office .
A large banner was produced by the front office for posting on the wall behind the section .
On April 3 , 2008 , with the Predators clinging to a 3–2 lead with 4:30 in their final home game of the regular season , a sellout crowd at what was then known as the Sommet Center , gave the team a standing ovation through the entirety of the final TV timeout .
The Predators went on to win the game against the St. Louis Blues and advanced to the playoffs that year , where the " standing O " during the final TV timeout has since become a fan tradition .
The mascot of the Predators is Gnash , a blue saber - toothed cat .
Introduced in 1998 , Gnash 's trademark includes stunts , such as very fast rappels , zip lines , and a pendulum swing that takes him under the scoreboard and just inches off the ice .
To go along with the saber - toothed cat mascot , Predators fans proudly use their Fang Fingers during each power play of the game .
There are foam saber - fang gloves that can be purchased , but most fans simply curl their index and middle fingers on each hand into fang shapes and brandish them in an up - and - down motion .
Fang Fingers are done to the horror sounds from the Alfred Hitchcock movie , Psycho .
Fans are also known for a variety of chants taunting players of the opposing team , particularly the goalie .
For example , after each Predators goal , fans call the opposing goalie 's name , accompanied by shouts of " It 's all your fault " and other epithets .
These cheers are sometimes said to originate from tradition at college football games , but some of these derive from traditions held by fans of pre - NHL hockey clubs Nashville Dixie Flyers , Nashville South Stars , Nashville Nighthawks , and Nashville Knights .
Nashville 's fanbase is said by many to be among the loudest in the National Hockey League , with sound levels reaching over 120 dB during the playoffs .
This has contributed to the team also being called " Smashville " .
JERSEY AND LOGO Section::::Jersey and logo .
For the 2011–12 season , the Nashville Predators changed their jersey design and color scheme .
The home jerseys are a bright gold with navy and white highlights , while the away jerseys are white with gold and navy highlights .
Furthermore , the Predators changed their logo , making it purely white , gold and navy .
The jerseys have a guitar pick on the shoulder with the Tennessee state tri - star inside it , lines meant to be guitar lines on the numbers , and piano keys along the neck line inside the jersey as a nod to Nashville 's internationally - known music heritage .
From the 2016–17 season gold helmets became a permanent part of the home uniform .
In the 2017–18 season the Predators changed their uniform style to fit with the new Adidas template .
While the gold home uniforms received minimal alterations , the away white uniforms featured more gold accents in the sleeves , shoulders and tail while navy was relegated to trim color .
OWNERSHIP Section::::Ownership .
The franchise was initially owned by a group led by Craig Leipold .
On May 23 , 2007 , Leipold was reported to have reached a tentative agreement to sell the team to Research in Motion chairman and co - CEO Jim Balsillie .
At the time , Leipold indicated that the team would play the 2007–08 season in Nashville but that the future of the team after that was not clear .
On June 23 , information was leaked by several sources indicating that Leipold no longer wanted to sell the Predators to Balsillie .
Subsequently , a campaign to land the team in Kansas City , Missouri , received a boost in late June 2007 .
The Canadian National Post , citing anonymous sources , reported that Leipold planned to sell the team to San Jose venture capitalist William " Boots " Del Biaggio III , who wanted to relocate the club to Kansas City 's new Sprint Center for the 2008–09 season .
Del Biaggio , who had a contract with Anschutz Entertainment Group to own an NHL club that would play home games in Sprint Center , had made an offer reported to be for about $ 190 million for the Predators .
Del Biaggio had entered an agreement two years earlier , in 2005 , to purchase the Pittsburgh Penguins , but the club backed out of the deal after it won the NHL draft lottery and took Sidney Crosby with the first overall pick .
On July 19 , 2007 , a group of local business owners known as Our Team Nashville held a rally at the Sommet Center to encourage fans to buy season tickets in order to help the Predators meet the attendance figures needed to keep the team in Nashville .
They drew approximately 7,500 fans and sold the equivalent of 726 full season tickets during the rally .
The rally was heavily supported by George Plaster , then a sportscaster on WGFX 104.5
" The Zone " sports radio in Nashville .
On August 1 , 2007 , the group released a letter of intent from Craig Leipold .
After negotiations with the City of Nashville , the local group headed by David Freeman reached an agreement with Nashville Mayor Karl Dean , and the NHL Board of Governors approved the sale on November 29 , 2007 .
The $ 172 million acquisition of the Nashville Predators included repayment of existing debt of approximately $ 61 million and $ 2.2 million in fees and expenses .
The sale of the Predators to the Tennessee - based group included Del Biaggio , who had been trying to move the team to Kansas City .
The locally based buyers held 73 % of the team , while Del Biaggio and a minority partner acquired about 27 % of the club .
In June 2008 , Del Biaggio ran into legal trouble over a multitude of unpaid loans , culminating in his filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy .
Furthermore , it was alleged that Del Biaggio acquired the loans he used to buy his stake in the team through fraudulent means , prompting an FBI investigation and criminal charges .
The charges culminated in a 97-month prison sentence for Del Biaggio .
Under United States bankruptcy law , a trustee was appointed to sell Del Biaggio 's assets , including his stake in the Predators , to pay off his creditors .
In November 2011 , it was announced that Calgary businessman W. Brett Wilson had purchased a 5 % interest in the Nashville Predators .
On March 1 , 2010 , during the 2009–10 season , the Predator 's front office saw Freeman stepped down as chairman of the Nashville Predators in favor of Thomas Cigarran .
Cigarran announced on September 2 that the local ownership group had completed the purchase of the Del Biaggio stake .
OWNERSHIP DISPUTE Section::::Ownership dispute .
On June 23 , 2016 , Freeman filed a $ 250 million lawsuit against the Nashville Predators and Cigarran .
His claim was that his ownership stake has been improperly diluted by Cigarran failing to notify him of capital calls , and that he had not received loan guaranty fees that the ownership group had agreed to pay him .
The lawsuit stated that Freeman initially owned a 48 % share , while the holding company for the Nashville Predators stated that Freeman controlled less than 1 % of ownership in the team at the time of the suit .
This dilution was exacerbated by the existence of two classes of investments in the Predators : the common units owned by Freeman were subject to capital calls ; the Series A units originally owned by Del Biaggio and his minority partner were not subject to capital calls .
The dispute was sent to court - ordered arbitration on July 29 , 2016 , under the supervision of NHL commissioner Gary Bettman .
As of January 25 , 2018 , arbitration was continuing in the unresolved dispute .
The outcome may remain undisclosed , as the arbitration is private .
