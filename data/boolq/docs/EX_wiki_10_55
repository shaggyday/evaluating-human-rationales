LUCKY FOR LIFE Lucky for Life ( LFL ) is a lottery drawing game ( as of September 2017 ) available in 25 states and the District of Columbia .
Lucky for Life , which began in 2009 in Connecticut as Lucky-4-Life , became a New England – wide game three years later , and added eleven lotteries during 2015 .
LFL 's slogan is " The Game of a Lifetime " .
Drawings remain in Connecticut ; Lucky for Life is drawn Mondays and Thursdays at 10:38 p.m. Eastern Time , using two drawing machines and numbered balls .
Lucky for Life was modified on September 17 , 2013 , adding a second " lifetime " prize tier , and a cash option for either annuity tier ; LFL was modified again in January 2015 to its current format .
Each Lucky for Life play costs $ 2 .

FIRST-
AND SECOND - PRIZE PAYOUTS
Section::::First- and second - prize payouts .
Unlike other American lottery games ( the exception being the nine - state Cash4Life )
Lucky for Life offers two annuitized prize levels ; both are advertised as " lifetime " prizes .
Beginning with the 2013 game modification , a first - prize winner can choose cash in lieu of the lifetime annuity ; second - prize winners also are offered a cash option .
A first - prize winner , if the annuity is chosen , receives , or shares , the equivalent of " $ 1,000 a day for life " ( the timing of the payments is according to the rules where the ticket was sold ) , with a 20-year guarantee ; if the winner dies , payments continue to the winner 's estate .
Second prize is $ 25,000 per year for life .
Lucky for Life uses a 5/48 ( white balls ) + 1/18 ( green " Lucky Balls " )
draw matrix ; its 2013 game modification had 43 balls in each of the two drums , while the previous version was 5/40 + 1/21 .
( The Connecticut - only game drew 4 of 39 white balls and 1 of 19 green " Lucky Balls " ; hence the name Lucky-4-Life . )
The 5/43 + 1/43 version never produced a top prize - winning ticket ; the first winner under the current matrix was sold in South Carolina for the November 19 , 2015 drawing .
The winner , who claimed the prize anonymously under SCEL rules , was the first winner to choose cash in lieu of the annuity for the game 's top prize , as all previous top prize winners are receiving their winnings under the game 's pre-2013 rules .
