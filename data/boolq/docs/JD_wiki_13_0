COOKING OIL Cooking oil is plant , animal , or synthetic fat used in frying , baking , and other types of cooking .
It is also used in food preparation and flavouring not involving heat , such as salad dressings and bread dips , and in this sense might be more accurately termed edible oil .
Cooking oil is typically a liquid at room temperature , although some oils that contain saturated fat , such as coconut oil , palm oil and palm kernel oil are solid .
There is a wide variety of cooking oils from plant sources such as olive oil , palm oil , soybean oil , canola oil ( rapeseed oil ) , corn oil , peanut oil and other vegetable oils , as well as animal - based oils like butter and lard .
Oil can be flavoured with aromatic foodstuffs such as herbs , chillies or garlic .
HEALTH AND NUTRITION Section::::Health and nutrition .
A guideline for the appropriate amount of fat — a component of daily food consumption — is established by regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration .
The recommendation is that 20 - 35 % of total daily calories should come from fat , with 10 % or fewer from saturated fat and the majority from polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats .
While consumption of small amounts of saturated fats is common in diets , meta - analyses found a significant correlation between high consumption of saturated fats and blood LDL concentration , a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases .
Other meta - analyses based on cohort studies and on controlled , randomized trials found a positive , or neutral , effect from consuming polyunsaturated fats instead of saturated fats ( a 10 % lower risk for 5 % replacement ) .
Mayo Clinic has highlighted certain oils that are high in saturated fats , including coconut , palm oil and palm kernel oil .
Those having lower amounts of saturated fats and higher levels of unsaturated ( preferably monounsaturated ) fats like olive oil , peanut oil , canola oil , soy and cottonseed oils are generally healthier .
The US National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute urged saturated fats be replaced with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats , listing olive and canola oils as sources of healthier monounsaturated oils while soybean and sunflower oils as good sources of polyunsaturated fats .
One study showed that consumption of non - hydrogenated unsaturated oils like soybean and sunflower are preferable to the consumption of palm oil for lowering the risk of heart disease .
Peanut oil , cashew oil and other nut - based oils may present a hazard to persons with a nut allergy .
TRANS FATS Section::::Trans fats .
Unlike other dietary fats , trans fats are not essential , and they do not promote good health .
The consumption of trans fats increases one 's risk of coronary heart disease by raising levels of " bad " LDL cholesterol and lowering levels of " good " HDL cholesterol .
Trans fats from partially hydrogenated oils are more harmful than naturally occurring oils .
Several large studies indicate a link between the consumption of high amounts of trans fat and coronary heart disease , and possibly some other diseases .
The United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute and the American Heart Association ( AHA ) all have recommended limiting the intake of trans fats .
COOKING WITH OIL Section::::Cooking with oil .
Heating an oil changes its characteristics .
Oils that are healthy at room temperature can become unhealthy when heated above certain temperatures , so when choosing a cooking oil , it is important to match the oil 's heat tolerance with the temperature which will be used .
Deep - fat frying temperatures are commonly in the range of , less commonly , lower temperatures ≥ are used .
Palm oil contains more saturated fats than canola oil , corn oil , linseed oil , soybean oil , safflower oil , and sunflower oil .
Therefore , palm oil can withstand deep frying at higher temperatures and is resistant to oxidation compared to high - polyunsaturated vegetable oils .
Since about 1900 , palm oil has been increasingly incorporated into food by the global commercial food industry because it remains stable in deep frying , or in baking at very high temperatures , and for its high levels of natural antioxidants , though the refined palm oil used in industrial food has lost most of its carotenoid content ( and its orange - red color ) .
The following oils are suitable for high - temperature frying due to their high smoke point above : *
Avocado
oil * Mustard oil *
Palm oil * Peanut oil ( marketed as " groundnut oil " in the UK and India )
* Rice bran oil
* Safflower oil * Semi - refined sesame oil
* Semi - refined sunflower oil Less aggressive frying temperatures are frequently used .
A quality frying oil has a bland flavor , at least smoke and flash points , with maximums of 0.1 % free fatty acids and 3 % linolenic acid .
Those oils with higher linolenic fractions are avoided due to polymerization or gumming marked by increases in viscosity with age .
Olive oil resists thermal degradation and has been used as a frying oil for thousands of years .
* Olive oil STORING AND KEEPING OIL Section::::Storing and keeping oil .
All oils degrade in response to heat , light , and oxygen .
To delay the onset of rancidity , a blanket of an inert gas , usually nitrogen , is applied to the vapor space in the storage container immediately after production – a process called tank blanketing .
In a cool , dry place , oils have greater stability , but may thicken , although they will soon return to liquid form if they are left at room temperature .
To minimize the degrading effects of heat and light , oils should be removed from cold storage just long enough for use .
Refined oils high in monounsaturated fats , such as macadamia oil , keep up to a year , while those high in polyunsaturated fats , such as soybean oil , keep about six months .
Rancidity tests have shown that the shelf life of walnut oil is about 3 months , a period considerably shorter than the best before date shown on labels .
By contrast , oils high in saturated fats , such as avocado oil , have relatively long shelf lives and can be safely stored at room temperature , as the low polyunsaturated fat content facilitates stability .
TYPES AND CHARACTERISTICS Section::::Types and characteristics .
Cooking oils are composed of various fractions of fatty acids .
For the purpose of frying food , oils high in monounsaturated or saturated fats are generally popular , while oils high in polyunsaturated fats are less desirable .
High oleic acid oils include almond , macadamia , olive , pecan , pistachio , and high - oleic cultivars of safflower and sunflower .
SMOKE POINT
Section::::Smoke point .
The smoke point is marked by " a continuous wisp of smoke .
" It is the temperature at which an oil starts to burn , leading to a burnt flavor in the foods being prepared and degradation of nutrients and phytochemicals characteristic of the oil .
Above the smoke point are flash and fire points .
The flash point is the temperature at which oil vapors will ignite but are n't produced in sufficient quantities to stay lit .
The flash point generally occurs at about .
The fire point is the temperature at which hot oil produces sufficient vapors they will catch on fire and burn .
As frying hours increase , all these temperature points decrease .
They depend more on an oil 's acidity than fatty - acid profile .
The smoke point of cooking oils varies generally in association with how an oil is refined : a higher smoke point results from removal of impurities and free fatty acids .
Residual solvent remaining from the refining process may decrease the smoke point .
It has been reported to increase with the inclusion of antioxidants ( BHA , BHT , and TBHQ ) .
For these reasons , the published smoke points of oils may vary .
Oils are extracted from nuts , seeds , olives , grains or legumes by extraction using industrial chemicals or by mechanical processes .
Expeller pressing is a chemical - free process that collects oils from a source using a mechanical press with minimal heat .
Cold - pressed oils are extracted under a controlled temperature setting usually below intended to preserve naturally occurring phytochemicals , such as polyphenols , plant sterols and vitamin E which collectively affect color , flavor , aroma and nutrient value .
COOKING OIL EXTRACTION AND REFINEMENT
Section::::Cooking oil extraction and refinement .
Cooking oil extraction and refinement are separate processes .
Extraction first removes the oil , typically from a seed , nut or fruit .
Refinement then alters the appearance , texture , taste , smell , or stability of the oil to meet buyer expectations .
EXTRACTION Section::::Extraction .
There are three broad types of oil extraction : * Chemical solvent extraction , most commonly using hexane .
* Pressing , using an expeller press or cold press ( pressing at low temperatures to prevent oil heating ) .
* Decanter centrifuge .
In large - scale industrial oil extraction you will often see some combination of pressing , chemical extraction and/or centrifuging in order to extract the maximum amount of oil possible .
REFINEMENT Section::::Refinement .
Cooking oil can either be unrefined , or refined using one or more of the following refinement processes ( in any combination ) :
* Distilling , which heats the oil to evaporate off chemical solvents from the extraction process .
* Degumming , by passing hot water through the oil to precipitate out gums and proteins that are soluble in water but not in oil , then discarding the water along with the impurities .
* Neutralization , or deacidification , which treats the oil with sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate to pull out free fatty acids , phospholipids , pigments , and waxes .
* Bleaching , which removes " off - colored " components by treatment with fuller 's earth , activated carbon , or activated clays , followed by heating , filtering , then drying to recoup the oil .
* Dewaxing , or winterizing , improves clarity of oils intended for refrigeration by dropping them to low temperatures and removing any solids that form .
* Deodorizing , by treating with high - heat pressurized steam to evaporate less stable compounds that might cause " unusual " odors or tastes .
* Preservative addition , such as BHA and BHT to help preserve oils that have been made less stable due to high - temperature processing .
Filtering , a non - chemical process which screens out larger particles , could be considered a step in refinement , although it does n't alter the state of the oil .
Most large - scale commercial cooking oil refinement will involve all of these steps in order to achieve a product that 's uniform in taste , smell and appearance , and has a longer shelf life .
Cooking oil intended for the health food market will often be unrefined , which can result in a less stable product but minimizes exposure to high temperatures and chemical processing .
WASTE COOKING OIL Section::::Waste cooking oil .
Proper disposal of used cooking oil is an important waste - management concern .
Oil can congeal on pipes provoking blockages .
Because of this , cooking oil should never be dumped in the kitchen sink or in the toilet bowl .
The proper way to dispose of oil is to put it in a sealed non - recyclable container and discard it with regular garbage .
Placing the container of oil in the refrigerator to harden also makes disposal easier and less messy .
RECYCLING
Section::::Recycling .
Cooking oil can be recycled .
It can be used as animal feed , directly as fuel , and to produce biodiesel , soap , and other industrial products .
In the recycling industry , used cooking oil recovered from restaurants and food - processing industries ( typically from deep fryers or griddles ) is called recycled vegetable oil ( RVO ) , used vegetable oil ( UVO ) , waste vegetable oil ( WVO ) , or yellow grease .
Yellow grease is used to feed livestock , and to make soap , make - up , clothes , rubber , detergents , and biodiesel fuel .
Used cooking oil , besides being converted to biodiesel , can be used directly in modified diesel engines and for heating .
Grease traps or interceptors collect fats and oils from kitchen sinks and floor drains which would otherwise clog sewer lines and interfere with septic systems and sewage treatment .
The collected product is called brown grease in the recycling industry .
Brown grease is contaminated with rotted food solids and considered unsuitable for re - use in most applications .
ADULTERATION Section::::Adulteration .
Gutter oil and trench oil are terms used in China to describe recycled oil processed to resemble virgin oil , but containing toxic contaminants and sold illegally for cooking ; its origin is frequently brown grease from garbage .
In Kenya , thieves sell transformer oil stolen from electric transformers to operators of roadside food stalls for use in deep frying , suitable for prolonged use longer than regular cooking oil , but a threat to consumer health due to the presence of PCBs .
