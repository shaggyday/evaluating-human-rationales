GAMEPLAY Section::::Gameplay .
Lego Jurassic World 's gameplay is similar to previous Lego video games .
Gameplay consists of the player solving puzzles .
The game features 20 levels , with five levels based on each film .
The levels are accessed through a free - roaming overworld area .
The game incorporates a two - player cooperation mode .
The game features more than 100 unlockable characters to play as , including more than 20 dinosaur species , such as Ankylosaurus , Stegosaurus , Triceratops and Tyrannosaurus .
Mr. DNA , a cartoon character featured in the 1993 Jurassic Park film , is also an unlockable character .
Throughout the game , Mr. DNA provides the player with hints ; and with dinosaur trivia , as he did in the Jurassic Park video game for the Super NES .
Human characters include Dr. Alan Grant , Ian Malcolm , and Owen Grady .
Each character has a special ability .
The utilization of each character 's ability is required to progress through the game .
Jurassic World producers Pat Crowley and Frank Marshall appear as unlockable characters , as well as the film 's director , Colin Trevorrow .
Steven Spielberg , who has acted as director and executive producer for films in the series , is also an unlockable character .

Hybrid dinosaurs can also be created from various parts of dinosaurs that can be unlocked during the game 's progression .
Enemies include Compsognathus , Dilophosaurus and Velociraptor .
The 3DS version excludes the free - roaming mode for a central hub instead , but is otherwise nearly identical to the home console versions of the game .
The Android and iOS versions also use a main hub section to access levels ; because of limitations on digital storage space , these versions feature fewer levels and fewer cutscenes than the home console versions , and the levels are also reduced in size .
The iOS version supports use of iCloud and Game Center .
PLOT Section::::Plot .
The game follows the storylines from the Jurassic Park films : Jurassic Park , The Lost World : Jurassic Park , Jurassic Park III and Jurassic World .
However , the developers modified the storylines to fit the events into five levels per film .
Notable scenes from each film have been recreated in the game .
Serious scenes from the films , including characters ' deaths , were replaced with humor for the video game as it was aimed at children ( for example , after most scenes depicting a character being eaten by a dinosaur occur , the dinosaur will later on regurgitate the character unharmed ) .

RECEPTION Section::::Reception .
According to review aggregator Metacritic , the PC , PlayStation 4 , Wii U , and Xbox One versions of Lego Jurassic World received " Mixed or average reviews , " while the iOS version received " Generally favorable reviews . "
Ebenezer Samuel of the New York Daily News noted the " largely simple and friendly " gameplay and puzzles , and wrote , " By and large , there 's plenty to love in LEGO Jurassic World , despite a smattering of little bugs .
TT Games does n't reinvent with LEGO Jurassic World at all .
But it does build a solid gaming experience that parents and kids can appreciate together . "
Gieson Cacho of San Jose Mercury News criticized the game 's camera angles , difficulty , and also noted that the game was too similar to previous Lego video games .
Cacho enjoyed the game 's playable dinosaurs , but also wrote , " Unfortunately , there are only a handful of moments where players control them . "
Dave Rudden of IGN praised the PC version for its fast pacing and " fun puzzles " .
However , Rudden criticized the " frustrating " presence of Compsognathus in each chapter of the game and said " the overworld is a bit of a mess , especially when I had to explore the islands to find the entrance to a new level . "
Matt Clapham of GamesRadar , who reviewed the PlayStation 4 version , enjoyed the game 's playable dinosaur characters , but criticized the " occasionally patchy " quality of dialogue that was incorporated into the game from the first three films , saying it " stands out next to the freshly voiced extras . "
Clapham also criticized the Compsognathus enemies ; the artificial intelligence of the game 's computer - controlled companion characters ; and noted that the game is prone to crashing .
Joe Juba of Game Informer , who reviewed the PlayStation 4 version , enjoyed the game 's colorful graphics and its use of theme songs from the films , but also felt that the gameplay was too similar to previous Lego video games .
Juba criticized the " annoying " Compsognathus enemies , and considered battles with other enemies to be " boring . "
Juba also felt that the game 's feature to play as dinosaurs took " too long to gain any steam . "
Juba also criticized the game for technical glitches , and felt that the limited amount of audio from the first three films was " distracting and poorly used . "
Juba concluded that , " Lego Jurassic World is a dull , occasionally frustrating experience with a lot of cute nods to the series for hardcore fans .
That 's as good as it gets . "
Jeremy Signor of GameSpot reviewed the PlayStation 4 version , and wrote that it had " style and undeniable charm that will melt your cynical heart , but the boring things the game makes you do hamper the joy . "
Signor wrote , " The problem is that you ca n't actually experiment with anything in any real sense .
The different abilities are simply keys to unlock progress or secrets .
You never get the chance to noodle around with the mechanics or improvise since there 's always just one solution to every obstacle the game puts in your way .
" Signor also criticized the audio from the original films , saying that it " was n't mixed very well with the game audio , which sounds jarring next to the pristine , polished sounds and voices recorded for the game " .
Signor concluded that the game focused too much on " visual and thematic experience almost entirely while letting the actual gameplay languish .
Jurassic Park in particular does n't suit this design because flattening the mechanics removes all notions of tension from the game , an essential part of the film series . "
Dave Letcavage of Nintendo Life , reviewing the Wii U version , wrote that the game " is exactly what we 've come to expect of the LEGO series , with very few surprises .
Thankfully , a herd of the missions are designed expertly , and they prove why such a prolific series has stayed relevant all these years .
But there are also numerous missions that fall flat , relying too heavily on unneeded combat or working too many playable characters into the mix .
The campaign is a bumpy ride to be sure , though it 's nowhere near being classified a disaster .
"
Letcavage wrote that in certain levels , the " poor quality " of the audio clips from the original films " and their contrast with the music and sound effects make them hugely jarring " .
Letcavage also noted that the Wii U version did not run smoothly in comparison to the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions .
NF Magazine , which reviewed the Wii U version , wrote , " LEGO Jurassic World is as ' more of the same ' as a game gets . "
Official Xbox Magazine ( UK ) wrote about the Xbox One version : " Plenty of expense spared , we think . "
Ron DelVillano of Nintendo Life criticized the 3DS version for its poor audio , and noted that its gameplay was too similar to previous Lego video games .
DelVillano wrote that utilizing the system 's 3D feature " ruins the entire experience .
Jagged lines make themselves present , the once smooth visuals deteriorate , and the frame rate drops just enough to make you feel like you 're playing at a slower speed .
It 's a disappointingly ugly experience . "
DelVillano also wrote that , " Because each film is condensed into a certain number of stages , large portions of the plots are left out in order to make room for more action .
What we 're left with is a mash up of interactive scenes that are loosely strung together by cinematic sequences that do n't fully explain what is going on around you . "
Kimberly Keller of Nintendo World Report praised the 3DS version : " As amazing as it is that there has never been a Lego and dinosaur match - up before now , this game makes up for lost time . "
However , she noted slow loading times between levels , the " annoying " Compsognathus enemies , and felt that the game was , " Not too unique compared to previous Lego titles . "
Rob Rich of Gamezebo reviewed the mobile version and praised the large amount of unlockable content and the " cleverly implemented " skills of its characters .
However , Rich criticized the mobile version for its hub feature , as well as its exclusion of certain cutscenes and levels from the home console versions ; Rich also noted that most of the game 's levels were smaller in comparison , and concluded , " LEGO Jurassic World on mobile is a bit disappointing , but that 's because I 'm so fond of the original release and can spot
what 's missing .
Honestly , it 's no wonder some content was cut when you consider how much less digital storage space the average mobile device has when compared to a console or PC .
Still , as with the earlier releases it shows plenty of reverence for the movies , and is easily the best mobile LEGO game I 've played to date . "
Ray Willmott of Pocket Gamer wrote that the iOS version was " good - old fashioned entertainment at its finest , " writing that " Traveller 's Tales has done a remarkable job of making everything feel refreshing , yet authentic .
"
Willmott wrote that the touch controls " occasionally are n't receptive to your gestures - particularly for jumping .
But the experience is generally fluid throughout . "
Willmott noted the sound effects as being " a bit tinny " , but praised the soundtrack and wrote that the graphics " occasionally sparkle and dazzle on the small screen .
"
Willmott concluded that while the game was not flawless , it was " a pleasure to play . "
Shaun Musgrave of TouchArcade reviewed the iOS version , and noted the game 's new vocal clips as well as the clips of " questionable quality grabbed from the movies , " stating that " the two styles of voice samples certainly do n't mesh well at all . "
However , Musgrave praised the game 's support of iCloud and Game Center , as well as its diverse iOS - specific control settings , stating , " While I may rag on these games for the way they pull their designs back from the console versions , it 's nice to see iOS - specific features get proper attention .
" Musgrave concluded that the game would appeal most to fans of Lego video games and of the Jurassic Park series . SALES Section::::Sales .
