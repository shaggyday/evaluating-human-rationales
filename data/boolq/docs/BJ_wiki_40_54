THE STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER
" The Stars and Stripes Forever " is a patriotic American march widely considered to be the magnum opus of composer John Philip Sousa .
By a 1987 act of the U.S. Congress , it is the official National March of the United States of America .
HISTORY Section::::History .
In his autobiography , Marching Along , Sousa wrote that he composed the march on Christmas Day , 1896 .
He was on an ocean liner on his way home from a vacation with his wife in Europe and had just learned of the recent death of David Blakely , the manager of the Sousa Band .
He composed the march in his head and committed the notes to paper on arrival in the United States .
It was first performed at Willow Grove Park , just outside Philadelphia , on May 14 , 1897 , and was immediately greeted with enthusiasm .
Following an Act of Congress in 1987 , it was officially adopted as the national march of the United States of America .
Historically , in show business and particularly in theater and the circus , this piece is called " the Disaster March " .
In the early 20th century , when it was common for theaters and circuses to have house bands , this march was a traditional code signaling a life - threatening emergency .
It subtly notified personnel of emergency situations and ideally allowed them to organize the audience 's exit without causing the chaos and panic that an overt declaration might .
Circus bands would never play the tune under circumstances other than impending disaster .
One memorable , if heartbreaking , example of its use was during the Hartford circus fire of July 6 , 1944 .
At least 168 people were killed , though some estimates are much higher .
Numerous bodies burned so badly that they were either unrecognizable or completely incinerated .
MUSIC Section::::Music .
" The Stars and Stripes Forever " follows the standard American military march form .
The march begins with a four - bar introduction , which is followed by the first strain and the second strain , which are repeated , the famous trio which is repeated with the obbligato piccolos , the break strain , the final strain , and then the break strain is repeated again .
In the final repeat of the trio ( grandioso ) , the low brass joins the piccolo players with a prominent countermelody .
Sousa explained to the press that the three themes of the final trio were intended to represent the three regions of the United States .
The broad melody , or main theme , represents the North .
The South is represented by the famous piccolo obbligato , and the West by the bold countermelody of the trombones .
The three come together in the climax , representing the Union itself .

SOUSA 'S LYRICS Section::::Sousa 's lyrics .
[ First strain ]
Let martial note in triumph float
And liberty extend its mighty hand
A flag appears ' mid thunderous cheers , The banner of the Western land .
The emblem of the brave and true Its folds protect no tyrant crew ;
The red and white and starry blue Is freedom 's shield and hope .
Let eagle shriek from lofty peak
The never - ending watchword of our land ; Let summer breeze waft through the trees
The echo of the chorus grand .
Sing out for liberty and light , Sing out for freedom and the right .
Sing out for Union and its might , O patriotic sons .
[ Second strain ]
Other nations may deem their flags the best And cheer them with fervid elation
But the flag of the North and South and West Is the flag of flags , the flag of Freedom 's nation .
( repeats )
Other nations may deem their flags the best And cheer them with fervid elation ,
But the flag of the North and South and West Is the flag of flags , the flag of Freedom 's nation .
[ Trio ]
Hurrah for the flag of the free !
May it wave as our standard forever ,
The gem of the land and the sea , The banner of the right .
Let despots remember the day When our fathers with mighty endeavor Proclaimed as they marched to the fray That by their might and by their right
It waves forever .
[ Grandioso ] Hurrah for the flag of the free .
May it wave as our standard forever
The gem of the land and the sea ,
The banner of the right .
Let despots remember the day When our fathers with mighty endeavor Proclaimed as they marched to the fray , That by their might and by their right
It waves forever .
