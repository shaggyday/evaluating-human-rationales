LIST OF REPTILES OF MICHIGAN Michigan , one of the fifty United States , is home to two types of lizards , nineteen types of snakes and eleven types of turtles , all members of the class Reptilia .
Reptiles are found throughout Michigan , although the only venomous species , the eastern massasauga rattlesnake , is seen only in the Lower Peninsula .
Reptiles are cold - blooded , and so usually pass the cold winters of Michigan in frost - free areas , such as underground burrows ( for snakes and land - dwelling turtles ) or the bottoms of lakes and streams ( for water - dwelling turtles ) .
Most reptiles in Michigan are protected by state law , but many are still at risk due to human encroachment on their habitats , the draining of wetlands and , in the case of snakes , indiscriminate killing by fearful humans .
In 1995 , the painted turtle was named as Michigan 's state reptile .
Reptile habitats in Michigan are generally split into four regions : the northern and southern Lower Peninsula and the eastern and western Upper Peninsula , with differentiations based on climate , soils , underlying bedrock and glacially - derived landforms .
Region one , the southern Lower Peninsula , is generally characterized by a warmer , less variable climate .
Loam and clay soils dominate the region , with a lesser amount of sand .
Deciduous hardwoods are the dominant tree species , with some natural prairies and savannas .
There is a greater diversity of plant life in this region , and it includes plant and animal species that are not found in any of the other regions .
Region two , the northern Lower Peninsula , has a climate that is cooler and more variable , with greater precipitation due to its proximity to the Great Lakes , more extensive uplands and more northern latitude .
Sandy soils and glacial deposits are the dominant soil type , while forests of conifer or mixed conifer and hardwood predominate .
Swamps and bogs are found more often in region two than region one .
Region three , the eastern Upper Peninsula , has a climate profile similar to region two .
Sand and clay dominate the soil of this region , which tends to be low in nutrients and poorly drained .
There are extensive wetlands , dominated by coniferous forests , while upland areas provide mixed conifer and broadleaf hardwood tracts .
Region four , the western Upper Peninsula , provides extensive bedrock structures .
The temperature is less moderate than in the other three regions , and can see frigid winters and hot summers .
Mixed conifer and broadleaf forests again dominate .
Three species of reptiles are considered to be threatened and two species are endangered â€“
these are protected under the Endangered Species Act of the State of Michigan .
Six more species are considered to be of special concern , though not protected under the act .
The copperbelly water snake is listed as threatened by the federal government , while the eastern massasauga rattlesnake is a candidate species to be included on the US endangered species list .
