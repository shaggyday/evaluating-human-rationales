POST - VOID DRIBBLING Post - void dribbling or post - micturition dribbling occurs when urine remaining in the urethra after voiding the bladder slowly leaks out after urination .
A common and usually benign complaint , it may be a symptom of urethral diverticulum , prostatitis and other medical problems .
Men who experience dribbling , especially after prostate cancer surgery , will choose to wear incontinence pads to stay dry .
Also known as guards for men , these incontinence pads conform to the male body .
Some of the most popular male guards are from TENA , Depend , and Prevail .
Simple ways to prevent dribbling include : strengthening pelvic muscles with Kegel exercises , changing position while urinating , or pressing on the perineum to evacuate the remaining urine from the urethra .
Sitting down while urinating is also shown to alleviate complaints : a meta - analysis on the effects of voiding position in elderly males with benign prostate hyperplasia found an improvement of urologic parameters in this position , while in healthy males no such influence was found .
