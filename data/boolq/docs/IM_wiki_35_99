PARKS AND RECREATION ( SEASON 7 )
The seventh and final season of Parks and Recreation aired in the United States on the NBC television network from January 13 , 2015 until February 24 , 2015 .
The season consisted of 13 episodes .
This season differs from any other season of Parks and Recreation , in that it details a much larger story arc for the characters , showcasing their growth over the course of the show .
Set in 2017 , following Season 6 , the season includes Leslie Knope 's ( Amy Poehler ) new career as Regional Director of National Park Service , in addition to her two - year long fallout with former boss Ron Swanson
( Nick Offerman ) .
Also included is the rise of fictional tech company Gryzzl taking over Pawnee , Leslie 's plea to Sweetums for a Pawnee National Park , and the eventual career departures of the gang from the Parks department .
CAST MAIN * Amy Poehler as Leslie Knope , a passionate government employee who loves her home town .
She has not let politics dampen her optimism ; her ultimate goal is to become President of the United States .
Poehler departed from the NBC sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live , where she was a cast member for nearly seven years , to star in Parks and Recreation .
It was only after she was cast that Daniels and Schur established the general concept of the show and the script for the pilot was written .
* Aziz Ansari as Tom Haverford , Leslie 's former sarcastic and underachieving subordinate , who has left his city hall job to pursue his own entrepreneurial interests .
Daniels and Schur had intended to cast Ansari from the earliest stages of the development of Parks and Recreation .
* Nick Offerman as Ron Swanson , the former parks and recreation director who , as a libertarian , believes in as small a government as possible .
As such , Ron strives to make his department as ineffective as possible , and favors hiring employees who do not care about their jobs or are poor at them .
Nevertheless , Ron consistently demonstrates that he secretly cares deeply about his fellow co - workers .
* Aubrey Plaza as April Ludgate - Dwyer , a cynical and uninterested former parks department intern who now works for Leslie at the National Parks Department .
The role was written specifically for Plaza ; after meeting her , casting director Allison Jones told Schur , " I just met the weirdest girl I 've ever met in my life .
You have to meet her and put her on your show . "
* Chris Pratt as Andy Dwyer , a goofy and dim - witted but lovable slacker .
Pratt was originally intended to be a guest star and the character Andy was initially meant to appear only in the first season , but the producers liked Pratt so much that , almost immediately after casting him , they decided to make him a regular cast member starting with season two .
* Adam Scott as Ben Wyatt , a brilliant but socially awkward government official trying to redeem his past as a failed mayor in his youth .
Scott left his starring role on the Starz comedy series Party Down to join the show .
* Jim O'Heir as Garry Gergich , a sweet - natured but painfully incompetent longtime city employee who is the main target of the office petty unkindness , yet enjoys his life as the husband of a gorgeous woman and the father of three beautiful daughters .
He reached retirement with a full pension in season 5 , but returned to the Parks office to work as an intern .
As of season six , the other characters have taken to calling him " Larry Gengurch , " after he accidentally called himself that name .
In a flashforward at the end of the season 6 finale , he is now called Terry .
By the end of the season 7 episode " Donna & Joe " , his friends finally call him by his real name Garry , thanks to Donna .
* Retta as Donna Meagle , the confident and competent former office manager for the Pawnee Parks and Recreation Department .
She is now accepting of her former coworkers , previously dismissing them as boring .
She currently works as a real estate agent .
She has little tolerance for stupidity , can sometimes be selfish , enjoys casual dating , and is irresistible to many men .
Donna loves her car , a Mercedes - Benz M - Class SUV .
* Billy Eichner as Craig Middlebrooks , the hot - tempered director of the Pawnee parks department .
After appearing in numerous episodes throughout the sixth season , Eichner was promoted from a recurring role to a main role in the cast , beginning with " Leslie & Ron , " the fourth episode of season seven .

IGN reviewer Matt Fowler gave the series finale a perfect 10 out of 10 score , saying " Doing what the show does best , Parks knocked it clear out of the park with " One Last Ride .
"
A remarkably irresistible swirl of love and satire .
The writers knew it was n't enough to just send everyone off into the future .
They knew we needed to see that future .
Not just for peace of mind , but because we 've all become so lovingly invested in the characters .
This final season proved to us that we could withstand a time jump and still remain attached to everyone .
And this finale used that to hop through the Pawnee gang 's futures , creating an exciting , heartwarming journey . "
