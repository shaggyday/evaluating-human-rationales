PREAKNESS STAKES
The Preakness Stakes is an American flat thoroughbred horse race held on the third Saturday in May each year at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore , Maryland .
It is a Grade I race run over a distance of 9.5 furlongs ( on dirt .
Colts and geldings carry 126 pounds ( 57 kg ) ; fillies 121 lb ( 55 kg ) .
It is the second jewel of the Triple Crown , held two weeks after the Kentucky Derby and two or three weeks before the Belmont Stakes .
First run in 1873 , the Preakness Stakes was named by a former Maryland governor after a winning colt at Pimlico .
The race has been termed " The Run for the Black - Eyed Susans " because a blanket of yellow flowers altered to resemble Maryland 's state flower is placed across the withers of the winning colt or filly .
Attendance at the Preakness Stakes ranks second in North America among equestrian events , only surpassed by the Kentucky Derby .
The 143rd running of the Preakness Stakes took place on Saturday , May 19 , 2018 .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Two years before the Kentucky Derby was run for the first time , Pimlico introduced its new stakes race for three - year - olds , the Preakness , during its first - ever spring race meet in 1873 .
Then Maryland governor Oden Bowie named the then mile and one - half ( 2.41 km ) race in honor of the colt Preakness from Milton Holbrook Sanford 's Preakness Stables in Preakness , Wayne Township , New Jersey , who won the Dinner Party Stakes on the day Pimlico opened ( October 25 , 1870 ) .
The New Jersey name was said to have come from the Native American name Pra - qua - les ( " Quail Woods " ) for the area .
After Preakness won the Dinner Party Stakes , his jockey , Billy Hayward , untied a silk bag of gold coins that hung from a wire stretched across the track from the judges ' stand .
This was the supposed way that the " wire " at the finish line was introduced and how the awarding of " purse " money came to be .
In reality , the term " purse " , meaning prize money , had been in use for well over a century .
The first Preakness , held on May 27 , 1873 , drew seven starters .
John Chamberlain 's three - year - old , Survivor , collected the $ 2,050 winning purse by galloping home easily by 10 lengths .
This was the largest margin of victory until 2004 , when Smarty Jones won by 11 1/2 lengths .
In 1890 Morris Park Racecourse in the Bronx , New York hosted the Preakness Stakes .
This race was run under handicap conditions , and the age restriction was lifted .
The race was won by a five - year - old horse named Montague .
After 1890 , there was no race run for three years .
For the 15 years from 1894 through 1908 , the race was held at Gravesend Race Track on Coney Island , New York .
In 1909 it returned to Pimlico .
Seven editions of the Preakness Stakes have been run under handicap conditions , in which more accomplished or favored horses are assigned to carry heavier weight .
It was first run under these conditions in 1890 and again in the years 1910 - 1915 .
During these years , the race was known as the Preakness Handicap .
In March 2009 Magna Entertainment Corp. , which owns Pimlico , filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy thus throwing open the possibility the Stakes could move again .
On April 13 , 2009 , the Maryland Legislature approved a plan to buy the Stakes and the Pimlico course if Magna Entertainment can not find a buyer .
Attendance at the Preakness Stakes ranks second in North America and usually surpasses the attendance of all other stakes races including the Belmont Stakes , the Breeders ' Cup and the Kentucky Oaks .
The attendance of the Preakness Stakes typically only trails the Kentucky Derby , for more information see American Thoroughbred Racing top Attended Events .
In February 2017 , the Maryland Stadium Authority released the first phase of a study saying that Pimlico needed $ 250 million in renovations .
As of May 2017 , no one showed interest in financing the work .
The Stronach Group , owner of Pimlico Race Course and Laurel Park , was only interested in moving the Preakness Stakes to Laurel Park unless someone else financed work on Pimlico .
EVOLUTION OF THE TRIPLE CROWN SERIES
Section::::Evolution of the Triple Crown series .
The Preakness is the second leg in American thoroughbred racing 's Triple Crown series and almost always attracts the Kentucky Derby winner , some of the other horses that ran in the Derby , and often a few horses that did not start in the Derby .
The Preakness is miles , or furlongs ( 1.88 km ) , compared to the Kentucky Derby , which is miles / 10 furlongs ( 2 km ) .
It is followed by the third leg , the Belmont Stakes , which is miles / 12 furlongs ( 2.4 km ) .
Since 1932 , the order of Triple Crown races has the Kentucky Derby first , followed by the Preakness Stakes and then the Belmont Stakes .
Prior to 1932 , the Preakness was run before the Derby eleven times .
On May 12 , 1917 , and again on May 13 , 1922 , the Preakness and the Derby were run on the same day .
Today , the Preakness is run on the third Saturday in May , two weeks after the Kentucky Derby , and three weeks before the Belmont Stakes .
Consequently , the race is run no earlier than May 15 , and no later than May 21 .
RUNNING THE RACE
Section::::Running the race .
Just after the horses for the Preakness are called to the post , the audience is invited to sing " Maryland , My Maryland " , the official state song of Maryland .
Traditionally , the Baltimore Colts ' Marching Band led the song from the infield .
Today , the United States Naval Academy Glee Club leads the song .
As soon as the Preakness winner has been declared official , a painter climbs a ladder to the top of a replica of the Old Clubhouse cupola .
The colors of the victorious owner 's silks are applied on the jockey and horse that are part of the weather vane atop the infield structure .
The practice began in 1909 when a horse and rider weather vane sat atop the old Members ' Clubhouse , which was constructed when Pimlico opened in 1870 .
The Victorian building was destroyed by fire in June 1966 .
A replica of the old building 's cupola was built to stand in the Preakness winner 's circle in the infield .
A blanket of yellow flowers daubed with black lacquer to recreate the appearance of a black - eyed Susan ( see Winning ) is placed around the winning horse 's neck at this time , and a replica of the Woodlawn Vase is given to the winning horse 's owner .
Should that horse have also won the Kentucky Derby , speculation and excitement immediately begin to mount as to whether that horse will go on to win the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing at the Belmont Stakes in June .
WINNING THE RACE Section::::Winning the race .
In 1917 , the first Woodlawn Vase was awarded to the Preakness winner , who was not allowed to keep it .
Eventually a half - size reproduction of the trophy was given to winners to keep permanently .
The original trophy is kept at the Baltimore Museum of Art and brought to the race each year under guard , for the winner 's presentation ceremony .
In 1940 , it was proposed to drape the winning horse in a garland of the Maryland State flower , Rudbeckia hirta , commonly called black - eyed Susans .
This posed a problem , as the race is run nearly two months before the flowers come into bloom in late June or July .
At first , yellow Viking daisies were painted to resemble black - eyed Susans .
Painted flowers have been discontinued since the first decade of the current millennium and viking poms , a member of the chrysanthemum family , are now used .
Although the Preakness is sometimes referred to as " the race for the black - eyed Susans " , no black - eyed Susan is ever used .
In 1918 , 26 horses entered the race , and it was run in two divisions , providing for two winners that year .
Currently , the race is limited to 14 horses .
In 1948 , the Preakness was televised for the first time by CBS .
The Preakness has been run at seven different distances : * miles ( 2.41 km ) :
1873–1888 , 1890
* miles ( 2.01 km ) : 1889 * miles ( 1.71 km ) : 1894–1900 , 1908 * 1 mile 70 yards ( 1.67 km ) : 1901–1907 * 1 mile ( 1.61 km ) : 1909 , 1910 * miles ( 1.81 km ) : 1911–1924 * miles ( 1.91 km ) :
1925–present PURSE MONEY Section::::Purse Money .
At its inauguration in 1873 , the Preakness carried a value of $ 1,000 .
The first major increase occurred in 1919 when the race had a $ 25,000 value .
It climbed to $ 100,000 in 1946 and in 1959 was raised to $ 150,000 .
Subsequent increases occurred from 1979 to 1989 , when the purse rose four times from $ 200,000 to $ 500,000 , before going to $ 1 million in 1997 .
On December 12 , 2013 , the Maryland Jockey Club announced for the 2014 running of the Preakness the purse would be increased from $ 1,000,000 to $ 1,500,000 .
INFIELDFEST Section::::InfieldFest .
The race has had something of a party atmosphere in the past , especially in the infield , which is general admission .
The course had a " bring your own booze " policy until 2009 , formerly including kegs of beer but in the 2000s restricted to all the beer cans a person could carry in a cooler .
However , despite crowds in excess of 100,000 , the BYOB policy was canceled in 2009 after videos of intoxicated people running along the tops of lines of portable toilets while being pelted by beer cans reached a large audience .
In 2009 , with the alcohol ban , race attendance dropped to 77,850 after topping 100,000 for eight consecutive years .
In 2010 , and the Maryland Jockey Club responded with a new event called " InfieldFest " with performances by musical acts , the " Mug Club " , which included an infield ticket and an unlimited - refill beer mug , and a mascot named " Kegasus " , a play on keg and pegasus ( though actually a centaur ) .
The much - derided Kegasus was retired in 2013 .
In 2010 , ticket sales had recovered to 95,760 and have since stayed high .
Aside from InfieldFest , the race is known for its fancy hats and official cocktail , the Black - eyed Susan , made with vodka , St - Germain liqueur and pineapple , lime and orange juices .
RECORDS Section::::Records .
Speed record :
* miles ( 1.91 km ) -
1:53 - Secretariat ( 1973 ) Secretariat , the 1973 winner ( and ultimately Triple Crown winner ) was originally credited with a running time of 1:55 .
Two Daily Racing Form clockers , however , had timed Secretariat 's Preakness in 1:53 , which would be a new stakes record .
A hearing was held over the time discrepancy , where a video replay showed Secretariat reached the wire faster than Canonero II , the then - current record holder , but instead of giving Secretariat the record , the Maryland Jockey Club decided to split the difference and make its official time that of Pimlico 's clocker , who had timed the race in 1:54 .
The matter was finally resolved in June 2012 , when a meeting of the Maryland Racing Commission unanimously ruled to change Secretariat 's final time to 1:53 based on testimony and analysis of the race replays .
Consequently , Secretariat holds the current official record for all three Triple Crown races .
