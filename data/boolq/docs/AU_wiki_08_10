KINGSNAKE
Kingsnake are colubrid New World constrictors , members of the genus Lampropeltis , which include milk snakes and four other species .
Among these , there are approximately 45 recognized subspecies .
ETYMOLOGY Section::::Etymology .
Lampropeltis in Greek means " shiny shield " , a name given to them in reference to their smooth dorsal scales .
RANGE OF HABITATION AND MORPHOLOGY Section::::Range of habitation and morphology .
Kingsnake species inhabit the Americas from southeastern Canada to southern Ecuador .
The several species vary widely in size and coloration .
Adult scarlet kingsnakes are typically 40 to 50 cm ( 16 to 20 in ) in length while the common kingsnake can grow to 1.8 m ( 6 ft ) .
Some kingsnakes are colored in muted browns to black while others are brightly marked in white , reds , yellows , grays and lavenders that form rings , longitudinal stripes , speckles and saddle - shaped bands .
BEHAVIOR AND DIET Section::::Behavior and diet .
Kingsnakes use constriction to kill their prey and tend to be opportunistic when it comes to their diet ; they will eat other snakes ( ophiophagy ) , including venomous snakes .
Kingsnakes will also eat lizards , rodents , birds , and eggs .
The common kingsnake is known to be immune to the venom of other snakes and does eat rattlesnakes , but it is not necessarily immune to the venom of snakes from different localities .
The " king " in the name ( as with the king cobra ) refers to this preying on other snakes .
Kingsnakes such as the California kingsnake can exert twice as much constriction force relative to body size as ratsnakes and pythons .
Scientists believe such strong coils may be an adaptation to snake and other reptile prey , which can sustain lower blood - oxygen levels before asphyxiating .
DESCRIPTION Section::::Description .
The majority of kingsnakes have quite vibrant patterns on their skins .
Some species of kingsnake , such as the scarlet kingsnake , Mexican milk snake , and red milk snake , have coloration and patterning that can cause them to be confused with the highly venomous coral snakes .
One of the mnemonic rhymes to help people distinguish between the coral snake and its nonvenomous lookalikes in the United States is " Red on black , friend of Jack ; Red on yellow , kill a fellow . "
( Other variations include " Red on yellow kills a fellow .
Red on black venom lack . "
and " Yellow , Red , Stop ! " , referencing the order of traffic lights .

It is important to note that both mnemonics apply only to coral snakes native to North America : Micrurus fulvius ( Eastern or common coral snake ) , Micrurus tener ( Texas coral snake ) , and Micruroides euryxanthus ( Arizona coral snake ) , found in the southern and western United States .
Coral snakes found in other parts of the world can have distinctly different patterns , have red bands touching black bands , have only pink and blue banding , or have no banding at all .
TAXONOMY Section::::Taxonomy .
Taxonomic reclassification is an ongoing process , and different sources often disagree , granting full species status to a group of these snakes that another source considers a subspecies .
In the case of Lampropeltis catalinensis , for example , only a single specimen exists , so classification is not necessarily finite .
In addition , hybridization between species with overlapping geographic ranges is not uncommon , confusing taxonomists further .
PREDATORS Section::::Predators .
The Kingsnake is often preyed upon by large vertebrates such as birds of prey .
Tarantula spiders also sometimes prey on the snake .
