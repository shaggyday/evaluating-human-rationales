GOLDEN SET
In tennis , a golden set is a set which is won without dropping a single point .
This means scoring the 24 minimum points required to win a set 6â€“0 , without conceding any points .
In professional , top - tier tennis , this has been accomplished only a few times .
A golden match , in which an opponent does not lose a single point in an entire match , has only been recorded three times in the history of competitive tennis , and never in a best of 5 set match .
Hazel Wightman of the United States recorded the first competitive golden match in 1910 .
It took over a century for the feat to be repeated , and then it occurred twice in the span of 42 days , first by Benjamin Tullou of France on 3 September 2016 at the 2016 France F17 Futures qualifying tournament , and then on 15 October 2016 by Joffrey de Schepper , also of France at the 2016 France F23 Futures qualifying event in Rodez , France .
The unfortunate opponent to both of these men in their golden matches was a 55-year - old amateur , Tomas Fabian of the Czech Republic , who failed to win a single game in five different matches in the same event over two seasons .
Mr. de Schepper did allow Fabian an " honor point " by deliberately hitting a ball in the last game out , but he is still generally credited with a golden match .
