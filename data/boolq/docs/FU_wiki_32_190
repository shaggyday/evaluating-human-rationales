EGG BALANCING Egg balancing is a traditional Chinese practice that has since been popularized in the United States .
Although the irregular shape of eggs makes this somewhat difficult , eggshells typically have many imperfections such that the vast majority can be balanced with minimal effort .
Despite folklore connecting this practice to the lunar new year in China , the Dragon Boat Festival in Taiwan and the vernal equinox in the United States , egg balancing can be done throughout the year and has no connection to the gravitational force of the moon or sun .
HISTORY LICHUN EGG Section::::History .
Section::::Lichun egg .
Egg balancing has been connected with Lichun , the solar term beginning Chinese spring ( ) on February 4 or 5 when the sun is at the celestial longitude of 315 ° .
On this day , fresh chicken eggs were balanced on their broad end .
In Taiwan , the practice is sometimes connected with the Dragon Boat Festival instead , on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month .
UNITED STATES Section::::United States .
A 1945 Life article reported on " an egg - balancing craze " among the population of Chungking ( the interim capital of China during World War II ) on that year 's Lichun .
That article and subsequent followings - up started a similar egg - balancing craze in the United States , but transposed to the vernal equinox beginning Western spring on March 20 or 21 when the sun is at the celestial longitude of 0 ° .
The idea that an egg is easier to balance on the spring equinox has since become an American urban legend , and egg - balancing events are sometimes held on that date .
In 1976 , New York artist Donna Henes started organizing egg - balancing ceremonies with the stated goal of bringing about world peace and international harmony .
These events , which often drew thousands of people , are still held annually by Henes in New York City .
SCIENCE

In fact , the balancing of most eggs on their broad ends is not particularly difficult at any time of the year .
No physical influence of other celestial bodies on the egg can affect its balance to the extent required by the folk belief .
Gravitational and electromagnetic forces , in particular , are considerably weaker and steadier than the disturbances created by the person 's breathing and heartbeat .
In 1947 , after Japanese newspapers picked up the story , the physicist Ukichiro Nakaya verified experimentally that eggs in fact can be balanced with ease at any time of the year .
He noticed that the shell of an egg usually has many small bumps and dimples so that , by turning the egg in different directions , it can be made to touch a flat surface on three points at the same time in many ways .
It is not hard to find an orientation such that the egg 's center of mass is contained within the triangle spanned by the three contact points , which is the condition for balancing any object .
His findings were replicated by astronomer Frank D. Ghigo of the University of Minnesota in 1984 .
Writing on the subject , Martin Gardner speculated that the folk beliefs inspired people to " try a little harder , be more patient , and use steadier hands " and possibly even to subconsciously sabotage attempts on other days .
He compared the self - reinforcing delusion to a " Ouija - board phenomenon " .
