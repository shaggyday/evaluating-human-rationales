SUNSHINE DURATION Sunshine duration or sunshine hours is a climatological indicator , measuring duration of sunshine in given period ( usually , a day or a year ) for a given location on Earth , typically expressed as an averaged value over several years .
It is a general indicator of cloudiness of a location , and thus differs from insolation , which measures the total energy delivered by sunlight over a given period .
Sunshine duration is usually expressed in hours per year , or in ( average ) hours per day .
The first measure indicates the general sunniness of a location compared with other places , while the latter allows for comparison of sunshine in various seasons in the same location .
Another often - used measure is percentage ratio of recorded bright sunshine duration and daylight duration in the observed period .
An important use of sunshine duration data is to characterize the climate of sites , especially of health resorts .
This also takes into account the psychological effect of strong solar light on human well - being .
It is often used to promote tourist destinations .
DAYTIME DURATION
Section::::Daytime duration .
If the Sun were to be above the horizon 50 % of the time for a standard year consisting of 8,760 hours , apparent maximal daytime duration would be 4,380 hours for any point on Earth .
However , there are physical and astronomical effects that change that picture .
Namely , atmospheric refraction allows the Sun to be still visible even when it physically sets below the horizon .
For that reason , average daytime ( disregarding cloud effects ) is longest in polar areas , where the apparent Sun spends the most time around the horizon .
Places on the Arctic Circle have the longest total annual daytime , 4,647 hours , while the North Pole receives 4,575 .
Because of elliptic nature of the Earth 's orbit , the Southern Hemisphere is not symmetrical : the Antarctic Circle , with 4,530 hours of daylight , receives five days less of sunshine than its antipodes .
The Equator has a total daytime of 4,422 hours per year .
DEFINITION AND MEASUREMENT Section::::Definition and measurement .
Given the theoretical maximum of daytime duration for a given location , there is also a practical consideration at which point the amount of daylight is sufficient to be treated as a " sunshine hour " .
" Bright " sunshine hours represent the total hours when the sunlight is stronger than a specified threshold , as opposed to just " visible " hours .
" Visible " sunshine , for example , occurs around sunrise and sunset , but is not strong enough to excite the sensor .
Measurement is performed by instruments called sunshine recorders .
For the specific purpose of sunshine duration recording , Campbell –
Stokes recorders are used , which use a spherical glass lens to focus the sun rays on a specially designed tape .
When the intensity exceeds a pre - determined threshold , the tape burns .
The total length of the burn trace is proportional to the number of bright hours .
Another type of recorder is the Jordan sunshine recorder .
Newer , electronic recorders have more stable sensitivity than that of the paper tape .
In order to harmonize the data measured worldwide , in 1962 the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) defined a standardized design of the Campbell – Stokes recorder , called an Interim Reference Sunshine Recorder ( IRSR ) .
In 2003 , the sunshine duration was finally defined as the period during which direct solar irradiance exceeds a threshold value of 120 W / m² .
GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION
Section::::Geographic distribution .
Sunshine duration follows a general geographic pattern : subtropical latitudes ( about 25 ° to 40 ° north / south ) have the highest sunshine values , because these are the locations of the eastern sides of the subtropical high pressure systems , associated with the large - scale descent of air from the upper - level tropopause .
Many of the world 's driest climates are found adjacent to the eastern sides of the subtropical highs , which create stable atmospheric conditions , little convective overturning , and little moisture and cloud cover .
Desert regions , with nearly constant high pressure aloft and rare condensation — like North Africa , the Southwestern United States , Western Australia , and the Middle East — are examples of hot , sunny , dry climates where sunshine duration values are very high .
The two major areas with the highest sunshine duration , measured as annual average , are the central and the eastern Sahara Desert — covering vast , mainly desert countries such as Egypt , Sudan , Libya , Chad , and Niger — and the Southwestern United States ( Arizona , California , Nevada ) .
The city claiming the official title of the sunniest in the world is Yuma , Arizona , with over 4,000 hours ( about 91 % of daylight time ) of bright sunshine annually , but many climatological books suggest there may be sunnier areas in North Africa .
In the belt encompassing northern Chad and the Tibesti Mountains , northern Sudan , southern Libya , and Upper Egypt , annual sunshine duration is estimated at over 4,000 hours .
There is also a smaller , isolated area of sunshine maximum in the heart of the western section of the Sahara Desert around the Eglab Massif and the Erg Chech , along the borders of Algeria , Mauritania , and Mali where the 4,000-hour mark is exceeded , too .
Some places in the interior of the Arabian Peninsula receive 3,600–3,800 hours of bright sunshine annually .
The largest sun - baked region in the world ( over 3,000 hours of yearly sunshine ) is North Africa .
The sunniest month in the world is December in Eastern Antarctica , with almost 23 hours of bright sun daily .
Conversely , higher latitudes ( above 50 ° north / south ) lying in stormy westerlies have much cloudier and more unstable and rainy weather , and often have the lowest values of sunshine duration annually .
Temperate oceanic climates like those in northwestern Europe , the western coast of Canada , and areas of New Zealand 's South Island are examples of cool , cloudy , wet , humid climates where cloudless sunshine duration values are very low .
The areas with the lowest sunshine duration annually lie mostly over the polar oceans , as well as parts of northern Europe , southern Alaska , northern Russia , and areas near the Sea of Okhotsk .
The cloudiest place in the United States is Cold Bay , Alaska , with an average of 304 days of heavy overcast ( covering over 3/4 of the sky ) .
In addition to these polar oceanic climates , certain low - latitude basins enclosed by mountains , like the Sichuan and Taipei Basins , can have sunshine duration as low as 1,000 hours per year , as cool air consistently sinks to form fogs that winds can not dissipate .
Tórshavn in the Faroe Islands is among the cloudiest places in the world with yearly only 840 sunshine hours .
