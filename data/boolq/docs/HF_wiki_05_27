LEXUS RX
The Lexus RX ( Japanese : レクサス・RX , Rekusasu RX ) is a mid - size luxury crossover SUV that is based on the Toyota Highlander / Kluger and sold since 1998 by Lexus , a luxury division of Toyota .
Originally released in its home market of Japan in late 1997 as the Toyota Harrier , export sales began in March 1998 as the Lexus RX .
Four generations of the Lexus RX have been produced to date , the first being compact in size , and the latter three classified as mid - size .
Both front- and four - wheel drive configurations have been used on the RX series , and several gasoline powertrain options , including V6 engines and hybrid systems , have been offered .
In the Lexus model lineup , the RX sits below the larger GX and LX body - on - frame SUVs , and above the smaller NX crossover .
The RX name stands for Radiant Crossover .
It has also been labelled as " Recreation Cross Country " in some markets .
The first - generation RX 300 , fitted with a 3.0-liter V6 engine , began sales in 1998 .
The Japanese market Toyota Harrier released in 1997 also offered a 2.2-liter inline - four , later uprated to 2.4-liters .
The second - generation RX 300 ( 3.0-liter V6 ) and RX 330 ( 3.3-liter V6 ) models went on sale in 2003 , with both variants supplanted by the more powerful RX 350 ( 3.5-liter V6 ) in 2006 .
Like the previous series , a 2.4-liter inline - four engine was sold alongside the 3.0-liter V6 in the Japanese market Toyota Harrier .
In 2005 , a hybridized gasoline - electric version of the 3.3-liter second - generation model was made available as the RX 400h in export markets and as the Harrier Hybrid in Japan .
For the third iteration released in 2009 , both RX 350 ( 3.5-liter V6 ) and RX 450h ( 3.5-liter V6 hybrid ) models were initially offered , with an entry - level RX 270 ( 2.7-liter inline - four ) offered by Lexus in some Asian markets , including in Japan , since 2010 .
Since the release of the third generation , Japanese sales have occurred under the Lexus RX name as opposed to Toyota Harrier as had been the case previously .
The success of the Lexus RX has been particularly strong in the United States , where it has been the best - selling luxury SUV since its introduction .
As one of the earliest luxury crossovers on the market , the RX has inspired similar competitors from rival marques .
The Lexus RX is the top selling Lexus hybrid , with global sales of 335,000 units through March 2016 , out of one million Lexus hybrids delivered since 2005 .
Manufacture of the RX has occurred at the Miyata plant in Miyawaka , Fukuoka , Japan since launch .
The RX and RX Hybrid were the first Lexus models to be built outside Japan , with North American market versions produced at the Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada plant in Cambridge , Ontario beginning 2003 ( RX ) and expanded in 2014 ( RX Hybrid ) .
Hybrid transaxles are built at the Kokura plant in Kitakyushu , Fukuoka since 2009 .

The idea concept behind the RX — a crossover between a luxury sedan and SUV — started in 1993 when it was hypothesized by TMS and Toyota Motor executives .
In 1994 , that vehicle was officially proposed by TMS executives at product planning meeting in Toyota City , Japan and put into development .
In December 1995 , the final design directed under designer Makoto Oshima was approved for production , and prototypes later went into testing in 1996 .
Prior to the RX public debut , a concept sport utility vehicle , the SLV , previewed the model at the Chicago Auto Show on 9 February 1997 .
The SLV name stood for Sport Luxury Vehicle .
The production - ready concept combined the characteristics of an SUV , wagon , and sedan , and featured high - ground clearance and an elevated seating position .
The concept 's overall design intent was to be commonly used for suburban driving .
At the debut of the concept vehicle , it was reported that the crossover was to be based on the ES 300 sedan , and would go into production with an entry - level price of over US$ 30,000 .
The RX was built on a unibody chassis .
Its exterior design was not typical of existing four - door vehicles at its introduction .
Among design features , the vehicle featured front triangular quarter - windows , door - mounted side mirrors , a rear liftgate with top - mounted spoiler , and translucent front and rear light covers with round lenses .
The exterior color scheme was two - tone , with the bumper and lower body - side cladding a gray color .
The RX 300 carried a drag coefficient of 0.36 C. The first - generation Lexus RX was built in Kyushu , Japan .
Introduced in Japan in December 1997 along with V6 powered versions , the four - cylinder powered Toyota Harrier was available in front - wheel drive ( SXU10 ) and all - wheel drive ( SXU15 ) form .

Its popularity contributed to the growth of the premium crossover SUV market , with several rival makes launching competing models in response to the RX 300 .
SECOND GENERATION ( XU30 ; 2003–2008 ) 2003–2007 Section::::Second generation ( XU30 ; 2003–2008 ) .
Section::::2003–2007 .
In 1998 , development began on the XU30 platform under chief engineer Yukihiro Okane .
Design work was started under Makoto Oshima and would continue into 2000 when a concept design by Hiroshi Suzuki was approved .
By early 2001 , the final production design was green - lighted by the executive board , with the first prototypes being tested in 2002 .
Design patents were filed on 1 April 2002 under No . 794 at the Japanese Patent Office and on 21 April 2003 at the United States Patent and Trademark Office .
The XU30 was previewed in January 2003 at the North American International Auto Show .

front and side view monitoring and cornering assist monitor with treat monitor .
The Lexus RX received a " Good " overall rating in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety frontal crash test .
U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) crash test results in 2004 rated the RX 330 the maximum five stars in the Frontal Driver , Frontal Passenger , Side Driver , and Side Rear Passenger categories , and four of five stars in the Rollover category .
In February 2003 , the second - generation Toyota Harrier ( codename ACU30 and MCU30 for the front - wheel drive models , and ACU35 and MCU35 for the all - wheel drive models ) was launched in Japan .
The Harrier was fitted either a 2.4 L I4 or 3.0 L V6 with or without all - wheel drive , and a new 5-speed automatic transmission with + /-
shift along with available " AIRS " air - suspension on the 3.0 L V6 models .
The new RX launched for European and Asian markets in early 2003 , where it was sold as the RX 300 ( MCU30 / MCU35 ) and made in Japan .
Asian markets included Singapore , where it succeeded the previously sold Harrier , South Korea , and Taiwan .
The RX 300 featured a 3.0 L V6 , with only the all - wheel drive version available , and air - suspension could be specified .
In North America , the RX 330 series began sales in March 2003 for the 2004 model year .
Here , the car was badged RX 330 denoting its larger 3.3-liter V6 .
The RX 330 ( MCU33 / MCU38 ) was powered by a 3.3-liter ULEV certified 3MZ - FE V6 , rated at SAE and linked to a 5-speed automatic and was offered in either front or all - wheel drive .

All North American models were initially built in Japan until September 2003 when production of the RX 330 began in Cambridge , Ontario , Canada .
For each year of the second and third generation RX , a small number of non - hybrid RXs were assembled in Japan .
Lexus debuted the RX 400h ( MHU38 ) at the North American International Auto Show in 2004 , with plans to launch the vehicle in the U.S. market .
The equivalent Harrier Hybrid debuted in Japan on 22 March 2005 , the same day as the Toyota Highlander Hybrid .
Hybrid production began in March 2005 at the Miyata plant .
The Lexus RX 400h made its U.S. sales debut in mid-2005 , with over 9,000 pre - orders at launch .
The RX 400h 's arrival in the U.S. had been delayed by several months ; Lexus had announced in November 2004 that the American launch of the hybrid Lexus SUV would occur for the 2006 model year .
The RX 400h became the first production premium hybrid vehicle when it went on sale in 2005 .
Compared to the Lexus RX 330 and RX 350 , the RX 400h featured a different front grille and round fog lights , and also differently styled LED taillights in place of the conventional LED ones on the RX 330 / RX 350 .
Different exterior colors were offered .
In 2007 , Hybrid badging was added to the rear side doors .
The RX 400h interior featured a hybrid information display on the navigation screen showing electrical motor , gasoline engine , and regenerative braking activation in real time .
Some RX 400h models without navigation screens displayed the information on a small monochrome display on the instrument panel .
When launched in 2005 , the RX 400h came exclusively with brushed aluminum interior accents , in place of the wood trim offered in the standard RX .
This changed in 2006 , when the RX 400h became available with Bird 's Eye Maple wood trim .
Since its launch , the all - wheel drive RX 400h /
Harrier Hybrid was sold at a substantial premium over the non - hybrid RX
300 / RX 330 / RX 350 / Harrier .
In the U.S. , the initial base price was , which was a premium over a similarly equipped RX 330 / RX 350 .
A front - wheel drive version of the RX 400h debuted in 2006 , with a base MSRP approximately less than the all - wheel drive RX hybrid .
For 2007 , along with the reduction of the federal hybrid tax credit for its hybrids , Lexus lowered the base price of the RX 400h to and for the respective all - wheel and front - wheel drive versions .
The list price in Japan for the Harrier Hybrid ranged from to .
Based on the 2010 Lexus RX redesign , there was no RX 400h for the 2009 model year .
However , the RX 400h did receive a facelift for the 2008 model year , featuring a blue Lexus badge and a rear spoiler that matches the body color .
The gasoline - powered part of the RX 400h engine system was a 3.3-liter 3MZ - FE V6 , very similar to the one found in the RX 330 .
It produced and .
The gasoline engine was aided by a maximum of two additional electric motors , one driving the front wheels , producing and and connected to the CVT gearbox , and the other driving the rear wheels , producing and .
The whole system , called Lexus Hybrid Drive ( also Hybrid Synergy Drive ) , produced a maximum of .
With Lexus Hybrid Drive , under normal driving conditions , only the front motor and gasoline engine were used .
The rear motor was only used under full - throttle acceleration or when the front wheels lost traction .
An Ni - MH battery was responsible for powering the motors , and charged by generators during deceleration or sharp cornering .
Standard features included an Electronically Controlled Brake and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management stability control system .
The RX 400h gasoline engine switched off automatically and the car ran completely on electricity when either stationary , decelerating , or being driven at slow speeds — less than .
Not only did the hybrid drive in the RX 400h improve fuel economy , but with the assistance of the electric motor , the RX 400h could reach in 7.3 seconds , quicker than the gasoline - only RX .
Despite the increased performance , the RX 400h /
Harrier Hybrid consumed roughly the same amount of gasoline as a compact four - cylinder sedan and it qualified as a Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle ( SULEV ) in the US .
Passing power at lower and mid engine rpm 's was noticeably improved due to the electric motor .
The water pump for the gasoline engine is driven by the camshaft belt .
To improve efficiency , and because the gasoline engine shuts down during electric - only operation , the alternator , power steering pump , and air conditioner compressor are beltless ; rather than being tied to engine output , these components are powered by electric motors via the battery instead .
The RX 400h served as the launch vehicle of the Lexus hybrid lineup , which later expanded to include hybrid versions of other Lexus vehicles , including the GS 450h and LS 600h
/ LS 600h L , and in 2009 , the first ever designated - hybrid ( no gasoline model available )
Lexus , the HS 250h .
In January 2005 , Lexus introduced the RX 330 " Thundercloud Edition " for the U.S. market , featuring a chrome horizontal - slatted grille , unique 5-spoke 18 " alloy wheels , black Bird 's Eye Maple wood trim , Thundercloud badges and carpeted floor mats , and two special exterior colors ( Thundercloud Metallic and Thundercloud Flint Mica ) .
Production was limited to 6,500 units .
In 2006 for the 2007 model year , the RX received a mid - cycle refresh consisting of a new 3.5-liter 2GR - FE V6 replacing the 3.3-liter 3MZ - FE V6 engine on non - hybrid models , updating the vehicle 's name from RX 330 to RX 350 , with new model codes GSU30 and GSU35 .
The RX 350 also featured an updated , Lexus Generation V DVD navigation system with improved graphics , voice controlled destination inputs , and a new feature called " bread crumbs . "
Bread crumbs will enable drivers to retrace their steps .
The new navigation system also featured voice dial systems and the ability to enter destinations by voice address while driving .

To further help improve visibility , water - repellent glass is used on the front doors .
Introduced in 2009 as a 2010 model year vehicle , the RX 450h ( GLV10 / GLV15 ) premiered alongside its non - hybrid counterpart , the RX 350 .
Manufacturer 's specifications indicated largely identical outward dimensions for the RX 450h with the RX 350 .
The RX 450h was scheduled to go on sale in the U.S. in mid to late 2009 , with sales introductions for the RX 450h in Asia ( including Japan ) and Europe in the same year .
The RX 450h features an upgraded 3.5 L 2GR - FXE V6 engine ( shared with the RX 350 ) which produces at 6000 rpm , along with a new inverter which boosts total horsepower to ( with the electric motors providing an added ) .
The new inverter is 8 kg lighter , and more efficient .
Up to three electric motors are used in the hybrid system , including two dual motors for the forward wheels ( 123 kW output ) , and a third for the rear wheels on the AWD model ( 50 kW ; engages when slippage is detected or the throttle pressed firmly ) .
The RX 450h 's V6 engine now runs on the Atkinson cycle for added efficiency .
Compared to the prior Otto cycle system , the Atkinson cycle has a lower compression ratio , along with higher expansion ratio inside engine cylinders .
This system uses less energy to form fuel - air mixtures , and releases more energy .
A lighter , more free - flowing oil ( 0W-20 ) is also used , reducing friction energy loss and oil pump power requirements .
Two additional systems are added to the RX 450h 's Lexus Hybrid Drive powertrain , an exhaust heat recovery system to reduce engine warm - up periods ( optimizing engine start - stop times , particularly in cold conditions ) , and a cooled exhaust gas - recirculation system to reduce fuel pumping loss .
The electric motors use the first automotive application of liquid cooling on both sides of the high - current transistors , allowing greater contribution from the electric motors versus the gasoline engine .
Fuel efficiency for the RX 450h ,
according to EPA testing , is increased by twenty percent over the previous RX 400h .
Initial manufacturer data pointed to an increase of at least eight percent over the prior model .
In the U.S. , the RX 450h is certified with a 2009 EPA fuel economy rating of 32 mpg city , 28 highway for the FWD model , and 30 mpg city , 28 highway for the AWD model .
This 30 mpg combined rating compares with the 20 mpg combined rating of the non - hybrid RX model .
The powertrain is linked to an instrument panel Eco light indicator , which enables drivers to monitor their fuel efficiency as it correlates with accelerator modulation .
In August 2010 , Lexus began offering the RX 270 ( AGL10 ) , a front - wheel drive model with a 2.7-liter 1AR - FE inline - four engine , in Japan , China , and Russia .
The RX 270 was a new entry - level offering for the RX lineup , produced with a lower base price and fewer emissions .
It was introduced at the 2010 Moscow Auto Show , and aimed to circumvent the additional taxes applied to automobiles with large engine displacements and higher emissions ; import cars in China over 3.0 L are subject to additional fees .
In July 2010 , Bloomberg reported that an all - electric Lexus RX had been developed in partnership with Tesla Motors .
The RX was fitted with a Tesla - designed battery pack , and is to be used as a test mule for electric vehicle development .
