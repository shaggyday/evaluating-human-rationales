VANISHING TWIN
A vanishing twin , also known as fetal resorption , is a fetus in a multi - gestation pregnancy which dies in utero and is then partially or completely reabsorbed .
In some instances , the dead twin will be compressed into a flattened , parchment - like state known as fetus papyraceus .
Vanishing twins occur in up to one out of every eight multifetus pregnancies and may not even be known in most cases . "
High resorption rates , which can not be explained on the basis of the expected abortion rate ... suggest intense fetal competition for space , nutrition , or other factors during early gestation , with frequent loss or resorption of the other twin(s ) . "
In pregnancies achieved by IVF , " it frequently happens that more than one amniotic sac can be seen in early pregnancy , whereas a few weeks later there is only one to be seen and the other has ' vanished ' . "
