BIRTH FLOWER
Each month has a flower that symbolizes the month of somebody 's birth .
The characteristics that the flower has may be " inherited " by whomever is born in that certain month person .
Every month has a flower that is sometimes referred to as a Birth Month Flower .
Flowers by month is a term describing flowers related to a recipient 's birth month , and in general flowers associated with particular months of the year .
It is one of a class of specialized categorizations offered by florists .
In a cultural sense , flower characteristics such as appearance , color , and scent , have relevance as gifts .
It is believed that it was the Romans who started celebrating birth and birthdays using flowers .
Seasonal flowers were used not just for decoration , but also taken as gifts and therefore can probably be credited with the tradition of birth flowers .
Some have been inspired by this tradition to create lists that associate a birthday flower with each of the days in a year .
