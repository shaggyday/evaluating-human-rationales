The genre of " scripted reality " has attracted much criticism for a lack of authenticity , or indeed outright deception ( see article on reality television ) .
The show has been criticised for its negative and stereotypical representation of Essex , and there have been a number of complaints to ITV2 .
Some Essex residents felt it was not a true representation of the area and the people who live there .
Kirk Norcross responded to this criticism by saying , " We are all from Essex , so this is Essex .
It 's not acting .
It 's not like they 've got people from America and said ' Right , act like you think you know where Essex is . '
We are Essex people so what you 're watching is Essex . "
In April 2011 , it was reported that Big Brother 8 winner Brian Belo intended to sue the makers of The Only Way Is Essex – claiming they " stole his idea " .
Belo was in the original pilot of the show – provisionally titled Totally Essex – alongside current stars Mark Wright , Sam Faiers , Kirk Norcross and Amy Childs .
Belo plans to sue his former manager and Lime Productions , which makes the show , for lost earnings of up to £ 100,000 a series .
The Sun reported that Belo had spent the previous two years working on an idea for a United Kingdom version of The Hills , with his manager successfully pitching the pilot to Lime Productions .
After not making the cast list , Belo believed he might be involved in producing the show , but was " cut " from the production entirely .
On 24 October 2011 , it was reported that sisters Sam and Billie Faiers had been attacked by a group of girls on a night out : " The sisters were first targeted inside the club when the girls made off with Billie 's handbag ...
When they left , the gang followed them back to Essex .
" An insider also commented saying " Both Sam and Billie later went to A&E to get checked out .
They are fine now , just a bit shocked , although Sam has been left with two black eyes . "
A video of the attack leaked online a day later .
The aftermath of the attack was aired during series 3 episode 10 .
In May 2012 , it was reported that original cast member Lauren Goodger had fallen out with the show 's director for her bad timekeeping on set and her diva demands .
Goodger appeared in the first four episodes of series 5 , and was suspended from appearing in the show , however on 18 May 2012 , it was confirmed that the issues had been resolved and that Goodger would be returning to the programme .
Goodger returned in episode 9 and her absence from the show was not mentioned on screen .
On 1 December 2012 , it was reported that X Factor finalist Rylan Clark would appear on the TOWIE Live special episode and later return as a full - time cast member in 2013 .
Mario Falcone reacted to the rumours by saying , " If he comes on Monday 's live show , that 's fine because it 's all for charity , but if he comes on TOWIE as a main character , I 'll leave .
We hate him .
He 's a douche bag . "
Kirk Norcross commented , " I 've met Rylan before
and he 's actually a really nice boy
but when people think of Essex they just think of the abbreviation , the ' Shut - up ' , the ' Oh my god ' -
that was all Amy Childs and we do n't want that .
" On 3 December , following Falcone and Norcross 's comments , Clark pulled out of his one - off appearance for the live episode , later saying : " TOWIE 's a great programme
and I wish them all the best of luck , but I ca n't do the show because I 've got commitments to the X Factor tour
and I 've got to be in rehearsals .
I 've never met Mario in my life , so I find it very unprofessional and ungentlemanly for him to go around talking about people he has n't even met , Anyone who cheats on his girlfriend that much is n't worth my time . "
The live episode was called " an utter car crash " and " possibly the worst TV show ever " .
