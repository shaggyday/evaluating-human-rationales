LANGUAGES OF SOUTH AMERICA
The languages of South America can be divided into three broad groups : * the languages of the ( in most cases , former ) colonial powers * many indigenous languages , some of which are co - official alongside the colonial languages * and various pockets of other languages spoken by immigrant populations that have survived assimilation by the majority languages
The languages introduced by the process of the European colonization of the Americas are chiefly European , some of whom have given rise to the formation of creoles .
