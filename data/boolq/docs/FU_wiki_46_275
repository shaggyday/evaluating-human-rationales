HISTORY Section::::History .
The first USC store opened in 1989 in Edinburgh and specialised in sports clothing .
USC originally stood for ' United Sports Corporation ' and was founded by Angus Morrison and David Douglas .
USC was purchased for £ 43 million by Sir Tom Hunter in 2004 .
The company entered into administration on 29 December 2008 , and 15 stores were closed .
The remaining 43 stores were bought in a pre - packaged deal by Dundonald Holdings Ltd , also owned by Sir Tom Hunter .
In July 2011 , Tom Hunter sold 80 % of USC to Mike Ashley 's Sports Direct chain .
In early 2012 , Sports Direct bought the remaining 20 % and now fully owns the business .
USC 's Head Office still remains in Dundonald , Ayrshire .
Sports Direct purchased Republic out of administration in 2013 and merged the business with USC .
2015
ADMINISTRATION Section::::2015 Administration .
On Thursday 8 January 2015 , City A.M. reported that Mike Ashley was preparing to place USC into administration , after filing a notice of the intention to appoint receivers at the High Court on Wednesday 7 January 2015 .
It was further reported by City A.M. that Duff & Phelps will act as the administrators .
On the morning of Wednesday 7 January 2015 , dozens of staff at the USC warehouse in Dundonald Ayrshire were given their notice of redundancy when trucks from Sports Direct arrived at the warehouse to take goods to Shirebrook , Nottingham .
In the two preceding months leases for many of USC 's stores were transferred to Republic , and the USC trademark was transferred to another Sports Direct company .
In October 2015 the chief executive of Sports Direct , David Forsey , was charged with a criminal offence for consultation failures over USC staff who only had 15 minutes notice of redundancy .
2015 RESTRUCTURING Section::::2015 Restructuring .
On January 16 , 2015 , USC was bought out of administration by another Sports Direct holding company , Republic Retail Limited .
Although controversial as a pre - packed administration this move allowed the existing stores and remaining staff to continue to trade .
Sports Direct received criticism by MPs for refusing to pay suppliers such as Diesel and laying off staff with only fifteen minutes notice .
Prior to the administration USC had been trading at a loss and had issues with its trade credit insurance , meaning that suppliers were not covered for lost stock if the company had collapsed .
The company owed money to Diesel who issued a winding up order to attempt to recoup the debt ; which is what triggered USC 's administration .
As of February 25 , 2015 , the administration process wiped £ 15.3 million worth of debt , leaving £ 15.2 million remaining owed to creditors .
Of this amount USC owes £ 14.3 million to trade and expense creditors , £ 576,499 to HMRC and £ 286,333 in issued gift vouchers .
