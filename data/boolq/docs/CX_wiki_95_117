JEEP PATRIOT
The Jeep Patriot ( MK74 ) is a front - engine five - door compact crossover SUV manufactured and marketed by Jeep , having debuted with the Jeep Compass in April 2006 at the New York Auto Show for the 2007 model year .
Both cars , as well as Dodge Caliber shared the GS platform , differentiated by their styling and marketing , with the Patriot exclusively offering a four - wheel drive system , marketed as Freedom Drive II .
The Patriot was manufactured at Chrysler 's Belvidere , Illinois assembly plant alongside the Compass .

DESIGN Section::::Design .
In the U.S.
the Patriot uses either the 2.0 L or 2.4 L World gasoline I4 engine .
Both front - wheel drive and four - wheel drive are available .
The Patriot features two four - wheel drive systems both of which are electronically controlled .
The basic four - wheel drive system is called Freedom Drive I.
This system is a full - time front - wheel - drive based 4WD / AWD system that is front - wheel - drive when it has traction , but can automatically put up to 20 - 30 % power to the rear wheels , or can be locked in 50 - 50 below a certain speed .
The other system , called Freedom Drive II , is based on Freedom Drive I , but by using the vehicle 's CVT transmission it is capable of a 19:1 gear reduction simulating a low range usually found in vehicles with dedicated transfer cases .
The 2.4 L GEMA I4 is an option for the 4X2 model Patriot .
For Europe and Australia , a 2.0 L ( 1968 cc ; 120 cid ; 140ps )
Volkswagen - manufactured diesel engine is fitted along with a 6-speed manual gearbox .
All EU cars are fitted as standard with four wheel drive and a version of the Freedom Drive System that tuned differently from the U.S. versions , but with similar capability to FDII with brake traction control and three switchable electronic stability control and traction control settings for on or off - road use .
The Patriot won 2007 Green 4x4 Award and the 2008 4x4 of the Year in the UK .
The Patriot uses a continuously variable transmission equipped with a four wheel drive system , marketed as Freedom Drive II , capable of holding the lowest ratio the CVT can reach , in lieu of a traditional two - speed transfer case .
