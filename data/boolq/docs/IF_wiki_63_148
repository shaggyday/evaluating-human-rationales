Using a hypnotized Elastigirl , she lures Mr. Incredible into a trap , then sends other hypnotized superheroes to subdue the Parr children .

Following The Incredibles , Brad Bird directed his next film for Pixar , Ratatouille , which was released in June 2007 .
Near its premiere , Bird said he was open to an idea of a sequel to The Incredibles , but only if it could be better than the original .
He stated , " I have pieces that I think are good , but I do n't have them all together . "
In a May 2013 interview , Bird reiterated his interest in a sequel : " I have been thinking about it .
People think that I have not been , but I have â€” because I love those characters , and love that world ...
I have many , many elements that I think would work really well in another Incredibles film , and if I can get 'em to click all together , I would probably wanna do that . "
While publicizing the first film , Bird had already conceptualized the eventual approach where Bob and Helen would switch roles , and Jack - Jack would develop multiple powers unknown to the family .
At the Disney shareholder meeting in March 2014 , Disney CEO and chairman Bob Iger confirmed that Pixar was working on an Incredibles sequel , and that Bird would return as writer .
Bird started the script around April 2015 , and said that the Incredibles sequel would be his next film after Tomorrowland .
One challenge in writing Incredibles 2 was how to deal with the large number of superhero films and television series that had been released since the first film , such as the Marvel Cinematic Universe .
To try to differentiate the sequel , Bird wanted to avoid tropes related to the superhero genre : " I do n't think that kind of idea stays interesting for very long .
For me , the interesting thing was never the superhero part of it .
It was more the family dynamic , and how do superhero things play into that . "
He said he wanted to include some unused ideas from the first film , and that the new story would focus on Helen Parr / Elastigirl .
Though the sequel was released fourteen years after the first , Bird did not want to use a narrative element like a timeskip or to come up with new characters , and instead continued from where the first film left off .
This allowed him to keep characters with the same superpowers and not have to develop new ones , nor did he need to figure out how to deal with Violet and Dash being adults .
This also allowed him to keep Jack - Jack as an infant with an array of powers , which Bird likened to how infants are able to understand numerous languages .
While the plot of the 2005 follow - up video game to The Incredibles , , begins at that same point of time , the film discards the game 's continuity .
The film was produced with a production budget of $ 200 million .
One advantage that Pixar had with Incredibles 2 was the advancement of technology the company had seen since the original film and a team of much more experienced animators .
Producer John Walker said , " I think that one of the things that excited Brad and Ralph Eggleston , the production designer , was the fact that the technology existed now to finally realize the designs in the way that they had hoped to realize them in 2004 .
There were no notions of , ' Well , we do n't know how to do long hair , we do n't know how to do humans , we do n't know how to do muscles . '
Everybody knows how to do it .
It 's just now about doing it quickly . "
Because Pixar no longer used the same systems from the first movie , all the characters had to be created from scratch on the computer again .
The studio also used physically - based human eye models for the characters for the first time , even if the eyes are larger and more stylized than in real humans .

The website 's critical consensus reads , " Incredibles 2 reunites Pixar 's family crimefighting team for a long - awaited follow - up that may not quite live up to the original , but comes close enough to earn its name . "
On Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating to reviews , the film has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100 , based on 51 critics , indicating " generally favorable reviews " .
Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare grade of " A+ " on an A+ to F scale , the same score as the first film , while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 93 % overall positive score and an 83 % " definite recommend " .
Robert Abele of TheWrap praised the film , saying : " Whatever the opposite of phoning in a sequel is , that 's Brad Bird 's progressive - minded , thunderously fun mix of super saves , throwback aesthetics and family comedy . "
A.A. Dowd , writing for The A.V. Club , felt it was " A sparkling contraption of an animated comedy , funny and often wondrous in its midcentury - modern vision of an alternate America frozen in the amber of a bygone idealism . "
David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a " B+ " , saying : " When the Parrs are pushed out of their comfort zone , Bird settles into his ...
[ after ] inciting a Spielberg - level monorail chase that reaffirms Bird 's lucid gift for kinetic and character - driven action filmmaking , the movie blasts off and never looks back . "
Stephanie Zacharek from Time considered it " bold [ and ] rapturously entertaining , " while David Sims at The Atlantic dubbed it " dazzling , thought - provoking , and sometimes overwhelming in terms of plotting . "
Varietys Owen Gleiberman called the film " fun but far from incredible " and wrote " It 's true that the Toy Story films , all three of which are fantastic , did variations on the same theme of a toy 's obsolescence , but as movies they kept the emotions close to the surface .
In Incredibles 2 , we never get that rush of feeling . "
Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars and said , " Incredibles 2 is content to punch the clock and stick to straight , bombastic action mode .
In that mode , composer Giacchino 's music is the most successful element , running nimble , beautifully orchestrated variations on themes that feel familiar in the best ways while retaining their spark .
The animation is bright and visually dynamic .
The script , well ... if the title were Satisfactories 2 , it 'd be about right . "
Ty Burr for The Boston Globe called it a " clattery , unfocused affair that at times is more irritating than fun . "

Association Awards EPILEPSY ISSUES Section::::Epilepsy issues .
Many disability advocates , including the Epilepsy Foundation , have raised concerns that scenes with flashing lights , particularly the scene of Elastigirl 's fight with the Screenslaver , can trigger seizures in viewers affected by photosensitive epilepsy .
As a result , several theaters posted warnings for audiences .
Disney issued a statement to USA Today stating that they appreciated the efforts the theaters had already made in making signs warning people seeing the movie .
They then asked theaters to warn audiences about the scene in a memo that read , " Incredibles 2 contains a sequence of flashing lights , which may affect customers who are susceptible to photosensitive epilepsy or other photosensitivities . "
In response to this , the UK released a re - edited version of the film with all affected sequences altered so that any flashing lights and strobe effects now pass the Harding test .
FUTURE Section::::Future .
Following the release of Incredibles 2 , director Brad Bird acknowledged that the film 's truncated production schedule resulted in many plotlines and ideas he had for the film being cut from the final version .
He cited Pixar 's decision in October 2016 to swap the release dates of Toy Story 4 and Incredibles 2 , which meant that Bird 's film lost a full year of production .
Bird stated that the lingering plotlines could lead to a third installment , just as they did with the second .
" There were a lot of ideas that we had on this film that could be [ used ] ... whether it 's another Incredibles film , or something else . "
Cast members including Samuel L. Jackson and Sophia Bush have expressed interest in reprising their roles .
Producer John Walker would not " rule [ a third film ] out " .
