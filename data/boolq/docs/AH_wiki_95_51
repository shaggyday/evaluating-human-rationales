LIST OF HIGHEST - GROSSING FILMS
Films generate income from several revenue streams , including theatrical exhibition , home video , television broadcast rights and merchandising .
However , theatrical box office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film , mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights , but also because of historical practice .
Included on the list are charts of the top box office earners ( ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue ) , a chart of high - grossing films by calendar year , a timeline showing the transition of the highest - grossing film record , and a chart of the highest - grossing film franchises and series .
All charts are ranked by international theatrical box office performance where possible , excluding income derived from home video , broadcasting rights and merchandise .
Traditionally , war films , musicals and historical dramas have been the most popular genres , but franchise films have been among the best performers in the 21st century .
Five Harry Potter films and five films from Peter Jackson 's Middle - earth series are included in the nominal earnings chart , while the Star Wars , Jurassic Park and Pirates of the Caribbean franchises feature prominently .
There is also strong interest in the superhero genre , with six films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe featuring among the nominal top - earners .
Marvel Comics has also had success with its Spider - Man and X - Men properties , while films based on Batman and Superman from DC Comics have generally performed well .
Although the nominal earnings chart is dominated by films adapted from pre - existing properties and sequels , it is headed by Avatar and Titanic ( both directed by James Cameron ) , which are original works .
Animated family films have performed consistently well , with Disney films enjoying lucrative re - releases prior to the home - video era .
Disney also enjoyed later success with films such as Frozen ( the highest - grossing animated film ) , Zootopia and The Lion King , as well as with its Pixar brand , of which Incredibles 2 , Toy Story 3 , and the Finding Nemo films have been the best performers .
Beyond Disney and Pixar animation , the Despicable Me , Shrek and Ice Age series have met with the most success .
While inflation has eroded away the achievements of most films from the 1960s and 1970s , there are franchises originating from that period that are still active .
Besides the Star Wars and Superman franchises , James Bond and Star Trek films are still being released periodically ; all four are among the highest - grossing franchises .
Some of the older films that held the record of highest - grossing film still have respectable grosses by today 's standards , but no longer compete numerically against today 's top - earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices .
When properly adjusted for inflation , however , on that comparative scale Gone with the Wind — which was the highest - grossing film outright for twenty - five years — is still the highest - grossing film of all time .
All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value , except where stated otherwise .
HIGHEST - GROSSING FILMS Section::::Highest - grossing films .
With a worldwide box - office gross of over $ 2.7 billion , Avatar is often proclaimed to be the " highest - grossing " film , but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income , which can form a significant portion of a film 's earnings .
Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful .
Titanic earned $ 1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals , in addition to the $ 2.2 billion it grossed in theaters .
While complete sales data are not available for Avatar , it earned $ 345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu - ray units in North America , and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu - ray units worldwide .
After home video income is accounted for , both films have earned over $ 3 billion .
Television broadcast rights will also substantially add to a film 's earnings , with a film often earning as much as 20–25 % of its theatrical box - office for a couple of television runs on top of pay - per - view revenues ; Titanic earned a further $ 55 million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights , equating to about 9 % of its North American gross .
When a film is highly exploitable as a commercial property , its ancillary revenues can dwarf its income from direct film sales .
The Lion King earned over $ 2 billion in box - office and home video sales , but this pales in comparison to the $ 6 billion earned at box offices around the world by the stage adaptation .
Merchandising can be extremely lucrative too : The Lion King also sold $ 3 billion of merchandise , while Pixar 's Cars — which earned $ 462 million in theatrical revenues and was only a modest hit by comparison to other Pixar films — generated global merchandise sales of over $ 8 billion in the five years after its 2006 release .
Pixar also had another huge hit with Toy Story 3 , which generated almost $ 10 billion in merchandise retail sales in addition to the $ 1 billion it earned at the box office .
On this chart , films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value , along with the highest positions they attained .
Thirty - six films in total have grossed in excess of $ 1 billion worldwide , of which four have grossed over $ 2 billion , with Avatar ranked in the top position .
All of the films have had a theatrical run ( including re - releases ) in the 21st century , and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket - price inflation , population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered .

Because of the long - term effects of inflation , notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices , the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films .
The unadjusted list , while commonly found in the press , is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time , as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list , despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases .
To compensate for the devaluation of the currency , some charts make adjustments for inflation , but not even this practice fully addresses the issue since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another .
For example , in 1970 , tickets cost $ 1.55 or about $ 6.68 in inflation - adjusted 2004 dollars ; by 1980 , prices had risen to about $ 2.69 , a drop to $ 5.50 in inflation - adjusted 2004 dollars .
Ticket prices have also risen at different rates of inflation around the world , further complicating the process of adjusting worldwide grosses .
Another complication is release in multiple formats for which different ticket prices are charged .
One notable example of this phenomenon is Avatar , which was also released in 3D and IMAX : almost two - thirds of tickets for that film were for 3D showings with an average price of $ 10 , and about one - sixth were for IMAX showings with an average price over $ 14.50 , compared to a 2010 average price of $ 7.61 for 2D films .
Social and economic factors such as population change and the growth of international markets also impact on the number of people purchasing theater tickets , along with audience demographics where some films sell a much higher proportion of discounted children 's tickets , or perform better in big cities where tickets cost more .
The measuring system for gauging a film 's success is based on unadjusted grosses , mainly because historically this is the way it has always been done because of the practices of the film industry : the box office receipts are compiled by theaters and relayed to the distributor , which in turn releases them to the media .
Converting to a more representative system that counts ticket sales rather than gross is also fraught with problems because the only data available for older films are the sale totals .
As the motion picture industry is highly oriented towards marketing currently released films , unadjusted figures are always used in marketing campaigns so that new blockbuster films can much more easily achieve a high sales ranking , and thus be promoted as a " top film of all time " , so there is little incentive to switch to a more robust analysis from a marketing or even newsworthy point of view .
Despite the inherent difficulties in accounting for inflation , several attempts have been made .
Estimates depend on the price index used to adjust the grosses , and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also impact upon the calculations , both of which can have an effect on the ultimate rankings of an inflation adjusted list .
Gone with the Wind — first released in 1939—is generally considered to be the most successful film , with Guinness World Records in 2014 estimating its adjusted global gross at $ 3.4 billion .
Estimates for Gone with the Winds adjusted gross have varied substantially : its owner , Turner Entertainment , estimated its adjusted earnings at $ 3.3 billion in 2007 , a few years earlier than the Guinness estimate ; other estimates fall either side of this amount , with one putting its gross just under $ 3 billion in 2010 , while another provided an alternative figure of $ 3.8 billion in 2006 .
Which film is Gone with the Winds
nearest rival depends on the set of figures used : Guinness had Avatar in second place with $ 3 billion , while other estimates saw Titanic in the runner - up spot with first - run worldwide earnings of almost $ 2.9 billion at 2010 prices .
The only other film that all sources agreed grossed in excess of $ 2
billion at recent prices is Star Wars ; according to Guinness it has earned $ 2.8 billion at 2014 price levels , while other sources from 2010/2011 put its adjusted earnings at $ 2.2–2.6 billion . ! scope="col " Rank ! scope="col

Audience tastes were fairly eclectic during the 20th century , but several trends did emerge .
During the silent era , films with war themes were popular with audiences , with The Birth of a Nation ( American Civil War ) , The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse , The Big Parade and Wings ( all World War I ) becoming the most successful films in their respective years of release , with the trend coming to an end with All Quiet on the Western Front in 1930 .
With the advent of sound in 1927 , the musical — the genre best placed to showcase the new technology — took over as the most popular type of film with audiences , with 1928 and 1929 both being topped by musical films .
The genre continued to perform strongly in the 1930s , but the outbreak of World War II saw war themed films dominate again during this period , starting with Gone with the Wind ( American Civil War ) in 1939 , and finishing with The Best Years of Our Lives ( World War II ) in 1946 .
Samson and Delilah ( 1949 ) saw the beginning of a trend of increasingly expensive historical dramas set during Ancient Rome / biblical times throughout the 1950s as cinema competed with television for audiences , with Quo Vadis , The Robe , The Ten Commandments , Ben - Hur and Spartacus all becoming the highest - grossing film of the year during initial release , before the genre started to wane after several high - profile failures .
The success of White Christmas and South Pacific in the 1950s foreshadowed the comeback of the musical in the 1960s with West Side Story , Mary Poppins , My Fair Lady , The Sound of Music and Funny Girl all among the top films of the decade .
The 1970s saw a shift in audience tastes to high concept films , with six such films made by either George Lucas or Steven Spielberg topping the chart during the 1980s .
The 21st century has seen an increasing dependence on franchises and adaptations , with the box office dominance of films based on pre - existing intellectual property at record levels .
Steven Spielberg is the most represented director on the chart with six films to his credit , occupying the top spot in 1975 , 1981 , 1982 , 1984 , 1989 and 1993 .
Cecil B. DeMille ( 1932 , 1947 , 1949 , 1952 and 1956 ) and William Wyler ( 1942 , 1946 , 1959 and 1968 ) are in second and third place with five and four films respectively , while D. W. Griffith ( 1915 , 1916 and 1920 ) , George Roy Hill ( 1966 , 1969 and 1973 ) and James Cameron ( 1991 , 1997 and 2009 )
all feature heavily with three films apiece .
George Lucas directed two chart - toppers in 1977 and 1999 , but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980 , 1981 , 1983 , 1984 and 1989 as well .
The following directors have also all directed two films on the chart : Frank Lloyd , King Vidor , Frank Capra , Michael Curtiz , Leo McCarey , Alfred Hitchcock , David Lean , Stanley Kubrick , Guy Hamilton , Mike Nichols , William Friedkin , Peter Jackson , Gore Verbinski and Michael Bay ; Mervyn LeRoy , Ken Annakin and Robert Wise are each represented by one solo credit and one shared credit , and John Ford co - directed two films .
Disney films are usually co - directed and some directors have served on several winning teams :
Wilfred Jackson , Hamilton Luske , Clyde Geronimi , David Hand , Ben Sharpsteen , Wolfgang Reitherman and Bill Roberts have all co - directed at least two films on the list .
Only five directors have topped the chart in consecutive years :
McCarey ( 1944 and 1945 ) , Nichols ( 1966 and 1967 ) , Spielberg ( 1981 and 1982 ) ,
Jackson ( 2002 and 2003 ) and Verbinski ( 2006 and 2007 ) .
Because of release schedules — especially in the case of films released towards the end of the year — and different release patterns across the world , many films can do business in two or more calendar years ; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release .
Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either , with many older films often being re - released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release ; a film 's first - run gross is included in brackets after the total if known .
Because of incomplete data it can not be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it , but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most .
In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded , and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re - released the previous record - holder is also retained .

At least ten films have held the record of ' highest - grossing film ' since The Birth of a Nation assumed the top spot in 1915 .
Both The Birth of a Nation and Gone with the Wind spent twenty - five consecutive years apiece as the highest - grosser , with films directed by Steven Spielberg holding the record on three occasions and James Cameron — the current holder — twice .
Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when Jurassic Park overtook E.T. , and Cameron emulated the feat when Avatar broke the record set by Titanic .
Some sources claim that The Big Parade superseded The Birth of a Nation as highest - grossing film , eventually being replaced by Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , which in turn was quickly usurped by Gone with the Wind .
Exact figures are not known for The Birth of a Nation , but contemporary records put its worldwide earnings at $ 5.2 million as of 1919 .
Its international release was delayed by World War I , and it was not released in many foreign territories until the 1920s ; coupled with further re - releases in the United States , its $ 10 million earnings as reported by Variety in 1932 are consistent with the earlier figure .
At this time , Variety still had The Birth of a Nation ahead of The Big Parade ( $ 6,400,000 ) on distributor rentals and — if its estimate is correct — Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ( $ 8,500,000 ) would not have earned enough on its first theatrical run to take the record ; although it would have been the highest - grossing ' talkie ' , displacing The Singing Fool ( $ 5,900,000 ) .
Although received wisdom holds that it is unlikely The Birth of a Nation was ever overtaken by a silent - era film , the record would fall to 1925 's Ben - Hur ( $ 9,386,000 ) if The Birth of a Nation earned significantly less than its estimated gross .
In addition to its gross rental earnings through public exhibition , The Birth of a Nation played at a large number of private , club and organizational engagements which figures are unavailable for .
It was hugely popular with the Ku Klux Klan who used it to drive recruitment , and at one point Variety estimated its total earnings to stand at around $ 50 million .
Despite later retracting the claim , the sum has been widely reported even though it has never been substantiated .
While it is generally accepted that Gone with the Wind took over the record of highest - grossing film on its initial release — which is true in terms of public exhibition — it is likely it did not overtake The Birth of a Nation in total revenue until a much later date , with it still being reported as the highest earner up until the 1960s .
Gone with the Wind itself may have been briefly overtaken by The Ten Commandments ( 1956 ) , which closed at the end of 1960 with worldwide rentals of $ 58–60 million compared to Gone with the Wind 's $ 59 million ; if it did claim the top spot its tenure there was short - lived , since Gone with the Wind was re - released the following year and increased its earnings to $ 67 million .
Depending on how accurate the estimates are , the 1959 remake of Ben - Hur may also have captured the record from Gone with the Wind : as of the end of 1961 it had earned $ 47 million worldwide , and by 1963 it was trailing Gone with the Wind by just $ 2 million with international takings of $ 65 million , ultimately earning $ 66 million from its initial release .
Another film purported to have been the highest - grosser is the 1972 pornographic film , Deep Throat .
In 1984 , Linda Lovelace testified to a United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on juvenile justice that the film had earned $ 600 million ; this figure has been the subject of much speculation , since if it is accurate then the film would have made more money than Star Wars , and finished the 1970s as the highest - grossing film .
The main argument against this figure is that it simply did not have a wide enough release to sustain the sort of sums that would be required for it to ultimately gross this amount .
Exact figures are not known , but testimony in a federal trial in 1976—about four years into the film 's release — showed the film had grossed over $ 25 million .
Roger Ebert has reasoned it possibly did earn as much as $ 600 million on paper , since mobsters owned most of the adult movie theaters during this period and would launder income from drugs and prostitution through them , so probably inflated the box office receipts for the film .
The Birth of a Nation , Gone with the Wind , The Godfather , Jaws , Star Wars , E.T. and Avatar all increased their record grosses with re - releases .
The grosses from their original theatrical runs are included here along with totals from re - releases up to the point that they lost the record ; therefore the total for The Birth of a Nation includes income from its reissues up to 1940 ; the total for Star Wars includes revenue from the late 1970s and early 1980s reissues but not from the 1997 Special Edition ; the total for E.T. incorporates its gross from the 1985 reissue but not from 2002 ; the total for Avatar — as the current record - holder — includes all its earnings at the present time .
Gone with the Wind is represented twice on the chart : the 1940 entry includes earnings from its staggered 1939–1942 release ( roadshow / general release / second - run ) along with all of its revenue up to the 1961 reissue prior to losing the record to The Sound of Music in 1966 ; its 1971 entry — after it took back the record — includes income from the 1967 and 1971 reissues but omitting later releases .
The Godfather was re - released in 1973 after its success at the 45th Academy Awards , and Jaws was released again in 1976 , and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases .
The Sound of Music , The Godfather , Jaws , Jurassic Park and Titanic increased their earnings with further releases in 1973 , 1997 , 1979 , 2013 and 2012 respectively , but they are not included in the totals here since they had already conceded the record prior to being re - released .

Prior to 2000 , only seven film series had grossed over $ 1 billion at the box office :
James Bond , Star Wars , Indiana Jones , Rocky , Batman , Jurassic Park and Star Trek .
Since the turn of the century that number has increased to over fifty ( not including one - off hits such as Avatar , Titanic and Frozen ) .
This is partly due to inflation and market growth , but also to Hollywood 's adoption of the franchise model : films that have built - in brand recognition , such as being based on a well known literary source or an established character .
The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them , and as such are known as " pre - sold " films within the industry .
A franchise traditionally has a tautological relationship with an intellectual property , but this is not a prerequisite .
An enduring staple of the franchise model is the concept of the crossover , which can be defined as " a story in which characters or concepts from two or more discrete texts or series of texts meet " .
A consequence of a crossover is that an intellectual property may be utilized by more than one franchise .
For example , belongs to not only the Batman and Superman franchises , but also to the DC Extended Universe , which is a shared universe .
A shared universe is a particular type of crossover where a number of characters from a wide range of fictional works wind up sharing a fictional world .
The most successful shared universe in the medium of film is the Marvel Cinematic Universe , a crossover between multiple superhero properties owned by Marvel Comics .
The Marvel Cinematic Universe is also the highest - grossing franchise , amassing over $ 17 billion at the box office .
The Star Wars films are the highest - grossing series based on a single property , earning over $ 9 billion at the box office ( although the Eon James Bond films have earned over $ 14 billion in total when adjusted to current prices ) .
If ancillary income from merchandise is included , then Star Wars is the most lucrative property ; it holds the Guinness world record for the " most successful film merchandising franchise " and was valued at £ 19.51 billion in 2012 ( approximately $ 30 billion ) .
The Marvel Cinematic Universe has had the most films gross over $ 1 billion with six and the three Avengers films comprise the only franchise where each installment has grossed over $ 1 billion .
Avengers is also the only franchise to have a series average of over $ 1 billion per film , although the Star Wars , Pirates of the Caribbean , Jurassic Park and Finding Nemo franchises , Harry Potter films , and Peter Jackson 's Middle - earth adaptation all average over $ 1 billion adjusted for inflation .
