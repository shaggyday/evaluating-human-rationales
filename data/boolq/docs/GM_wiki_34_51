The Criminal Law Amendment Act , 1968–69 made it a per se offense to drive with a BAC in excess of 80 mg/100
ml of blood .
Refusal of a police officer 's demand to provide a breath sample was made an offence at the same time and both began as summary conviction offenses , with a mandatory minimum $ 50 fine .
MEXICO
* Mexico : 0.04–0.10 % UNITED STATES
* United States : Depends on state , 0.08 % or 0.05 % BAC by volume In the United States , the blood alcohol level at which all states make it unlawful to operate a motor vehicle is 0.08 , although it is possible to be convicted of impaired driving at a lower blood alcohol level .
Some states define two impaired driving offenses .
*
The first is the traditional offense , variously called driving under the influence of alcohol ( DUI ) , driving while intoxicated / impaired ( DWI ) , operating under the influence ( OUI ) , or operating while intoxicated / impaired ( OWI ) .
*
* The second and more recent is the so - called illegal per se offense of driving with a blood alcohol concentration ( BAC ) by volume ( mass of alcohol / volume of blood ) of 0.08 % ( previously 0.10 % ) or higher .
* Section::::United States .
The first offense requires proof of intoxication , although evidence of BAC is admissible as rebuttably presumptive evidence of that intoxication ; the second requires only proof of BAC at the time of being in physical control of a motor vehicle .
An accused may potentially be convicted of both offenses as a result of a single incident , but may only be punished for one .
The differences between state penalties still varies .
Wisconsin , for instance , is the only state that continues to treat first offense drunk driving arrests as forfeiture .
Some states also include a lesser charge of driving with a BAC of 0.05 % ; other states limit this offense to drivers under the age of 21 .
All states and DC also now have zero tolerance laws : the license of anyone under 21 driving with any detectable alcohol in their bloodstream ( BAC limits of 0.01 % or 0.02 % apply in some states , such as Florida . ) will be suspended .
In 2009 , Puerto Rico joined these states , setting a limit of 0.02 for drivers under 21 , despite maintaining a legal drinking age of 18 .
The blood alcohol limit for commercial drivers is 0.04 % .
Pilots of aircraft may not fly within eight hours of consuming alcohol , while under the impairing influence of alcohol or any other drug , or while showing a blood alcohol concentration equal to or greater than 0.04 grams per decilitre of blood .
Utah became the first U.S. state to lower the legal limit to .05 % BAC by volume on 24 March 2017 .
The law takes effect on 30 December 2018 .
The bill 's passage , HB155 , was controversial in the state .
A poll published on 29 July 2017 found 50 percent of Utahns supported the new law , but 47 percent opposed it .
In most states , the timing of the chemical test for suspected drunk driving is important because the law mandates a result within a given time period after the driving stopped , usually two hours .

In British law it is a criminal offence to be drunk in charge of a motor vehicle .
The definition depends on such things as being in or near the vehicle , and having access to a means of starting the vehicle 's engine and driving it away ( i.e. , the keys to a vehicle ) .
A passenger in the vehicle can also be prosecuted if the police can prove that they were driving under the influence at some point .
The UK 's drug driving laws were updated in 2015 .
The changes included : a new roadside testing kit , which could detect the presence of cocaine and cannabis in a suspect 's saliva ; zero tolerance limits for a number of illegal drugs , Limits were also set for certain prescription medications .
The laws , however , did not end the use of the field impairment test , but made them more relevant for determining driver impairment by those drugs that are not now covered by the new legislation , or can not be identified by the limited use of a device , that currently are only authorised for cannabis and cocaine .
FURTHER RULES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM ( UK ) Section::::Further rules in the United Kingdom ( UK ) .
In the UK , driving or attempting to drive whilst above the legal limit of 0.08 % BAC in England , Wales and Northern Ireland , and 0.05 % BAC in Scotland or unfit through drink carries a maximum penalty of six months ' imprisonment , a fine of up to £ 5,000 and a minimum twelve months ' disqualification .
For a second offense committed within ten years of conviction , the minimum ban is three years .
Being in charge of a vehicle whilst over the legal limit or unfit through drink could result in three months ' imprisonment plus a fine of up to £ 2,500 and a driving ban .
Causing death by careless driving when under the influence of alcohol or other drugs carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years in prison , a minimum two - year driving ban and a requirement to pass an extended driving test before the offender is able to drive legally again .
It is an offense to refuse to provide a specimen of breath , blood or urine for analysis .
The penalties for refusing are the same as those for actual drunk driving .
The offense of driving whilst under the influence of alcohol is one to which there is no defense , as such ( although defences such as duress or automatism , which are not specific to the offense of driving with excess alcohol , may apply in certain rare circumstances ) .
However , it may be possible to argue that special reasons exist which are such that the offender should n't be disqualified from driving despite having committed the offense .
Special reasons are notoriously difficult to establish and the burden of proof is always upon the accused to establish them .
Such reasons may include : * shortness of distance driven * unintentional commission of the offence ( i.e. , laced drinks )
* emergencies MAGISTRATES ' SENTENCING GUIDELINES
Section::::Magistrates ' sentencing guidelines .
In England and Wales , when DWI offenders appear before a magistrates ' court , the magistrates have guidelines they refer to before they decide on a suitable sentence to give the offender .
These guidelines are issued by the Sentencing Guidelines Council and cover offenses for which sentence is frequently imposed in a magistrates ' court when dealing with adult offenders .
Offenses can either be tried summarily which means they can only be heard in the magistrates ' court or they can be either way offense which means magistrates may find their sentencing powers are insufficient and indict the case to crown court .
The majority of drunk driving offenses are summary only offences which can only be tried in a magistrates ' court .
Only the most serious offences such as a collision , death or injury involved are indicted to crown court .
The maximum sentence magistrates can usually impose for " being in charge of a vehicle while above the legal limit or unfit through drink " is a £ 2,500 fine , a three - month prison sentence or a driving ban .
The maximum sentence magistrates can usually impose for " driving or attempting to drive while above the legal limit or unfit through drink " is six months ' imprisonment , an unlimited fine or a driving ban for at least 1 year ( 3 years if convicted twice in 10 years ) .
In theory , the fine is means tested and based on disposable income .
As with England and Wales , road traffic law in Scotland is in the main framed within the Road Traffic Act 1988 as amended .
Prosecution and disposal of drink - drive offenses is broadly similar to England and Wales with less serious cases prosecuted on complaint through the sheriff summary courts .
Cases involving aggravations , life - changing or fatal injuries are prosecuted on indictment via the sheriff solemn or high court .
As with most UK - wide legislation , the penalties and sentencing guidelines for drunk driving in Scotland mirror those in effect in England and Wales .
OCEANIA
AUSTRALIA
Section::::Oceania .
Section::::Australia .
Road laws are state or territory based , but all states and territories have set similar rules .
Australian law allow police officers to stop any driver and perform a random breath test without reason .
Roadblocks can be set up ( for example , leading out of town centers on Friday and Saturday nights and after football matches or other major events ) , where every single driver will be breath - tested .
This differs from UK and US laws where police generally need a reason to suspect that the driver is intoxicated before requesting a breath or sobriety test .
It is an offence to refuse to provide a sample of breath when requested with severe penalties including prison .

* Limits apply within three hours of driving - that is , police can require a person to submit to an alcohol or drugs test within three hours of driving and it is an offense to fail that test , unless the drug or alcohol use occurred after driving ( see Road Safety Act 1986 , ss .
49 , 53 and 55E ) .
* Licenses cancelled for certain serious drunk - driving offenses may only be reissued after obtaining a court order .
This is the case for repeat offenders , and first offenders above 0.15 % .
In such cases , the relicensed driver is subject to a 0 limit for three years following relicensing , or for as long as the person is required to use an alcohol interlock .
*
Alcohol interlocks must be imposed whenever a repeat drunk - driver is relicensed .
* A court also has discretion to impose an alcohol interlock when relicensing a first offender in certain serious cases , generally when the offense involves a BAC of 0.15 % or higher .
* The law requires interlocks to be used for certain minimum periods , but the requirement to use an interlock does not automatically end at the completion of the minimum period .
Once that period has expired , an individual may apply to a court to have the interlock condition removed from their driver 's license .
The State Police must be given notice of the application and may make submissions to the court on whether the interlock condition should be removed .
The court will also take into account data recorded by the interlock itself ( e.g. , whether any attempts were made to start the vehicle by a person who had been drinking ) .
* Driving without an interlock when one is required carries severe penalties , including imprisonment .
*
If a doctor sees any patient who is aged fifteen years or over as a result of a motor vehicle accident , the patient must allow the doctor to take a blood sample for testing for alcohol and drug content in a way that preserves the chain of evidence .
If this process is skipped the doctor may not be able to discover the alcohol blood level .
The results can be used as evidence in subsequent court proceedings .
*
The law allows a police officer to require any driver ( or any person who has driven a vehicle within the last three hours ) to perform a random saliva test for methamphetamine , cannabis and MDMA , all of which are subject to a zero limit ( see Road Safety Act 1986 : ss .
49 , 55E & 55D )

NEW ZEALAND Section::::New Zealand .
New Zealand operates a program called Compulsory Breath Testing , which allows police to stop motorists at any time .
CBT is usually carried out at roadside checkpoints but mobile patrol cars can also randomly stop motorists to administer a test .
The police also carry out roadside drug tests upon motorists they suspect have used drugs .
The system in New Zealand is age - based .
the limits are : * 0 limit for people under twenty years * 0.05 % BAC or 250μg / L breath for people twenty years and over
The penalties for exceeding the limits are : * People under twenty years , up to 0.03 % BAC , 150 μg / L breath : instant NZ$200 fine and fifty demerit points
* People under twenty years , 0.03–0.08 % BAC , 150–400 μg / L breath : up to three months imprisonment , up to NZ$2,250 fine or both .

All people over 0.08 % BAC , 400 μg / L breath ( third and subsequent offenses ) : two years imprisonment ; NZ$6,000 fine ; loss of license for one year or more Note that penalties apply to the lowest reading taken across both breath and blood tests .
For example , if a driver twenty years or over has a breath test result of 426 μg / L but a subsequent blood test returns 0.077 % BAC , then the driver is not charged with any drink driving offense despite the breath reading being over the breath alcohol limit .
The penalty for injuring or killing someone when under the influences is the same as dangerous driving ( up to five years imprisonment , up to NZ$20,000 or both .
Loss of license for one year or more ) .
