LIST OF SMOKING BANS IN THE UNITED STATES
The following is a list of smoking bans in the United States .
For smoking bans and restrictions outside the United States , see the worldwide list of smoking bans .
The United States Congress has not attempted to enact any type of nationwide federal smoking ban .
Therefore , smoking bans in the United States are entirely a product of first - level jurisdictional , local criminal , and occupational safety and health laws .
In 1995 , California was the first state to enact a statewide smoking ban ; throughout the early to mid-2000s , especially between 2004 and 2007 , an increasing number of states enacted a statewide smoking ban of some kind .
As of July 2018 , the most recent statewide smoking ban is Alaska 's , which was signed into law on July 18 , 2018 , and went into effect on October 1 , 2018 .
As further detailed in this list , smoking laws vary widely throughout the United States .
Some places in the United States do not generally regulate smoking at all , some ban smoking in certain areas and not others , and some ban smoking nearly everywhere , even in outdoor areas ( no state bans smoking in all public outdoor areas , but some local jurisdictions do ) .
As of July 1 , 2017 , according to the American Nonsmokers ' Rights Foundation , 81.5 % of the U.S. population lives under a ban on smoking in " workplaces , and/or restaurants , and/or bars , by either a state , commonwealth , or local law " , and 58.6 % live under a ban covering all workplaces and restaurants and bars .
A smoking ban ( either state or local ) has been enacted covering all bars and restaurants in each of the 60 most populated cities in the United States except these 11 : Atlanta , Jacksonville , Memphis , Miami , Las Vegas , Nashville , Oklahoma City , Philadelphia , Tampa , Tulsa , and Virginia Beach .

INDIANA
*
Statewide smoking ban excluding bars , and casinos .
Effective July 1 , 2012 , after having been signed into law by Governor Mitch Daniels on March 19 , 2012 , Indiana 's 1993 statewide Clean Indoor Air Law was repealed and replaced by a new chapter of the Indiana Code titled " Prohibition on Smoking .
" The new chapter bans smoking in all enclosed public places and workplaces in Indiana and within of an entrance thereto , except as exempted .
The law exempts : ( 1 ) horse racing facilities including off - track betting parlors ; ( 2 ) riverboats ; ( 3 ) all indoor portions of casinos and other licensed gaming facilities ; ( 4 ) cigar bars and hookah lounges ; ( 5 ) private clubs ; ( 6 ) retail tobacco stores ; ( 7 ) bars and taverns ( defined as any business with a liquor license that does not allow in persons under 21 years of age ) ; and ( 8) cigar manufacturers .

* Attempts in the Indiana General Assembly to enact a ban on smoking in all workplaces in Indiana , including all bars and restaurants , have failed every year since 2007 .
In April 2007 , the Indiana Senate removed a smoking ban from a health care funding bill passed by the Indiana House of Representatives , and in January 2008 , a proposed statewide smoking ban introduced by Rep. Charlie Brown died in a House committee without a vote or debate .
In April 2009 , another proposed statewide ban introduced by Rep. Brown was passed in the House by a vote of 70–26 after being amended to exempt restaurants , bars , and casinos , and then did not receive a committee hearing in the Senate .

In April 2011 , a Senate committee voted 8–1 to reject a statewide ban exempting bars , casinos , private clubs , retail tobacco shops , and nursing homes , which also had been introduced by Rep. Brown and previously had passed the House , 68 - 31 .
The ban that ultimately was enacted in 2012 passed the House as a complete ban on smoking in all workplaces in Indiana , including all bars and restaurants ( and authored again by Rep. Brown ) , but was amended by the Senate to include the above exemptions , upon which the House agreed to the Senate 's exemptions .

No statewide smoking ban .
Instead , Missouri 's 1992 statewide smoking law , the Indoor Clean Air Act , prohibits smoking in all enclosed public places ( including workplaces ) and public meetings , except in designated smoking areas , which may occupy no more than 30 % of the place 's enclosed area .
Warning signs must be appropriately posted either way .
Local governments may prohibit smoking in schools , child daycare facilities , and school buses , as well as in public places .
Bars , restaurants that seat fewer than 50 people , bowling alleys , billiard parlors , retail tobacco shops , rooms and halls used for private social functions , limousines and taxicabs where the driver and all passengers agree to smoking , stage performances including smoking , indoor sports stadiums seating more than 15,000 people , and private residences " are not considered a public place " .
On June 23 , 2009 , the Western District of the Missouri Court of Appeals ruled that Kansas City 's 2008 local ban on smoking in all workplaces , including bars and billiard parlors , did not conflict with this statute and was not preempted .
The Supreme Court of Missouri later declined to hear an appeal from that decision .
* Attempts in the Missouri General Assembly to enact some form of statewide smoking ban have failed every year since 2008 , except for 2015 , when one was not even introduced : * Bills to ban smoking statewide by Senator Joan Bray before the Missouri Senate in 2008 , 2009 , and 2010 and by Rep. Walt Bivens before the Missouri House of Representatives in 2010 all failed without receiving a committee hearing .
In 2009 , a proposal by Rep. Joe Fallert to amend the Constitution of Missouri to ban smoking statewide and a bill by Rep. Jill Schupp proposing .1
%
a tax on all non - smoke - free businesses also both failed this way .
*
In 2011 , a bill by Rep. Jill Schupp received a hearing before a House committee , but the committee did not put it up for a vote .
*
In 2012 , respective bills by Rep. Schupp and Sen. Maria Chappelle - Nadal to ban smoking statewide both failed without receiving a committee hearing , while a bill by Rep. Melissa Leach to undo the Court of Appeals ' 2009 smoking ban decision underwent a committee hearing , though no vote was held .
*
In 2013 , respective bills by Rep. Schupp and Sen. Chapelle - Nadal to ban smoking statewide both failed without even being referred to a committee , while a bill by Rep. Bill Otto to prohibit localities from banning smoking in riverboat casinos underwent a committee hearing but without a vote , and a bill by Rep. Kathie Conway to deprive localities banning smoking of their sales and property tax revenue from smoking - banned private businesses was passed by the House Local Government Committee , but did not advance to a vote before the full House of Representatives .
*
In 2014 , respective bills by Reps . Schupp and Courtney Curtis and Sen. Chapelle - Nadal to ban smoking statewide all failed without a committee hearing , while a bill by Rep. Conway to deprive localities banning smoking of their sales and property tax revenue from smoking - banned private businesses was passed by the House Local Government Committee , but did not advance to a vote before the full House of Representatives .

For 2013 , the periodic " Freedom in the 50 States " study prepared by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University ranked Missouri first in the nation in tobacco freedom ( also # 3 for alcohol freedom and # 7 for freedom overall ) .
As of December 2013 , Missouri has the lowest cigarette excise taxes in the United States , at 17 cents per pack , and the state electorate previously voted in 2002 , 2006 , and 2012 to keep it that way .
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , in 2012 Missouri had the seventh highest percentage of adult smokers among U.S. states , at 25 % .
In both January 2011 and January 2013 , the Missouri House of Representatives voted to continue allowing smoking in its half of the Missouri State Capitol .
In October 2008 , a statewide survey by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services found that only 27.5 % of Missourians support a statewide ban on smoking in all bars and cocktail lounges .
Missouri also has one of the most permissive approaches to alcohol in the United States ( see Alcohol laws of Missouri ) .
* As detailed below , of the 961 cities in Missouri , only 36 ( 3.7 % ) have enacted comprehensive smoking bans , though all of Missouri 's municipalities exceeding 100,000 residents have adopted comprehensive no smoking ordinances .
St. Louis County bans smoking in many places , though exempting bars and casinos and is the lone county in the state with smoking provisions of any kind .
Nine cities and one county have rejected a smoking ban in some manner , and eight other municipalities have provided exceptions for workplaces and/or bars and/or restaurants .
On April 5 , 2011 , Cape Girardeau became one of the few cities in the United States ever to have rejected a smoking ban in a public vote .

The bill was passed in the South Dakota State Legislature and signed into law by Governor Mike Rounds .
It was scheduled to take effect in July 2009 , but on June 22 , 2009 , a group of casino and video lottery operators presented the Secretary of State with a petition for a referendum over H.B. 1240 that they claimed to bear 25,000 valid signatures .
On June 25 , 2009 , the Secretary of State certified that the petition indeed bore at least the required 16,776 valid signatures , putting H.B. 1240 to the November 2010 public referendum .
On July 24 , 2009 , the Secretary of State declared that after further review , the number of valid signatures on the petition fell short of the required number to put the issue on the ballot .
On November 13 , 2009 , however , Circuit Judge Kathleen Trandahl ruled that the petition did have enough valid signatures , and ordered the Secretary of State to put the issue to a public vote on November 2 , 2010 , which ultimately passed .
H.B. 1240 is silent as to whether local governments may regulate smoking more stringently , though as of November 2010 no local governments in South Dakota have done so .
TENNESSEE
* No statewide smoking ban .
Instead , Tennessee 's 2007 statewide smoking law , the Non - Smoker Protection Act , prohibits smoking statewide in all public places in Tennessee , except as exempted ; ( 1 ) any business , including a bar or restaurant , that does not serve persons under 21 , ( 2 ) designated hotel / motel smoking rooms , ( 3 ) tobacco industry - related facilities , ( 4 ) outdoor areas and areas with an open garage door , ( 5 ) nursing homes , ( 6 ) designated smoking areas not accessible to the general public in businesses with three or fewer employees , ( 7 ) private clubs , ( 8) private residences and vehicles unless it is being used for child care , daycare , or public transportation of children , ( 9 ) retail tobacco stores , and ( 10 ) commercial vehicles occupied solely by the operator .
Local governments are preempted from regulating smoking .
TEXAS
* No statewide smoking ban .
Instead , Texas ' 1997 statewide smoking law only prohibits smoking in activities of public schools on or off school property , elevators , theatres , libraries , museums , hospitals , buses , airplanes , and trains , as long as these areas are open to the general public , unless the proprietor designates the place for smoking and posts appropriate warning signs .
Violation of this law is a class C misdemeanor .
Texas law is silent as to whether local governments may regulate smoking more stringently than the state , and on December 9 , 2004 , the Texas Court of Appeals upheld El Paso 's municipal ban on smoking in all bars and restaurants .
As of April 1 , 2018 , 133 cities in Texas have enacted local smoking bans to varying degrees .
* Attempts to ban smoking statewide have failed twice before the Texas Legislature , first in May 2007 when a bill to ban smoking statewide in all enclosed workplaces , including bars and restaurants passed the Texas House of Representatives by a vote of 91–48 after being amended to allow any business owner to opt out of the ban by posting signs saying smoking is permitted , and then did not receive a vote in the Texas Senate , and then again in May 2009 , when a similar bill was passed by a Senate committee but did not receive the 21 votes necessary to reach the Senate floor .

UNITED STATES VIRGIN ISLANDS
* Territory - wide smoking ban : Effective February 10 , 2011 , smoking is banned in all enclosed workplaces , including bars and restaurants , and in outdoor service lines .
UTAH
*
Statewide smoking ban : Effective January 1 , 2007 , as passed in March 2006 ( amended in 2012 ) , Utah 's 1995 Indoor Clean Air Act was expanded to ban smoking statewide in all enclosed workplaces in Utah , including bars and restaurants ( bars and private clubs were exempt until January 1 , 2009 ) , exempting only ( 1 ) designated hotel / motel smoking rooms , ( 2 ) areas of owner - operated businesses with no employees besides the owner , and ( 3 ) American Indian religious and cultural ceremonies .
Since the state law supersedes any ordinances passed by political subdivisions of the state ( i.e. , cities , counties , school districts , agencies , etc . ) , such political subdivisions are preempted from regulating indoor smoking any more or less stringently than the Act .
Utah is one of the few states with a statewide smoking ban that does not exempt tobacconists .
* Local outdoor smoking bans : Notwithstanding the preemption against political subdivisions modifying the restrictions on indoor smoking , the Act expressly allows such political subdivisions to regulate " smoking in outdoor places of public access which are owned or operated by " ( emphasis added ) a political subdivision ( specifically including state institutions of public or higher education ) .
Accordingly , some political subdivisions have enacted local ordinances prohibiting smoking in certain outdoor areas such as schools , parks , and public transit facilities .
VERMONT
* Statewide smoking ban :
Effective September 1 , 2005 , smoking is banned in all enclosed workplaces in Vermont , including all bars and restaurants , except in areas of owner - operated businesses with no employees that are not open to the public , although separately ventilated designated smoking areas in businesses where employees are not required to be were exempt until July 1 , 2009 .
Designated unenclosed smoking areas in businesses where the layout of the workplace is such that smoking would not be a physical irritation to any nonsmoking employee and three - fourths of the employees agreed were also exempt until July 1 , 2009 .
The Vermont Veterans Home in Bennington is the only non - owner - operated workplace in the state permitted to allow smoking .
Vermont is one of the few states with a statewide smoking ban that does not expressly exempt tobacconists , and is one of four states that does not allow the designation of hotel / motel smoking rooms .
Local governments may regulate smoking more stringently than the state law .
Section::::Vermont .
Illegal to smoke in a car with a passenger under age 8 .
VIRGINIA
* No statewide smoking ban .
Instead , Virginia 's 2009 statewide smoking law , the 2009 Indoor Clean Air Act prohibits smoking statewide in enclosed public elevators , public school buses , primary and secondary schools , hospital emergency rooms , health department offices , polling places , indoor service lines and cashier lines , public restrooms in government buildings and hospitals , child daycare centers except where located in a private home , and public restrooms of health care facilities , and relegating smoking in restaurants ( including bars ) to separately ventilated designated smoking rooms that are structurally separated from the rest of the establishment .
The Act exempts private clubs , retail tobacco stores , tobacco warehouses , tobacco manufacturing facilities , prisons , designated smoking areas in government offices , food preparation facilities for catering services , restaurants located on the premises of tobacco manufacturers , rented private rooms in restaurants ; requires the reasonable designation of non - smoking areas in educational facilities where smoking is not banned , hospitals , retail stores bigger than , and recreational facilities .
Section::::Virginia .
Local governments are preempted from regulating smoking more stringently than the Act .
Effectively , the cost and complexity involved with complying with the law 's requirements for separately ventilated smoking areas has meant that nearly all Virginia bars and restaurants operate completely smoke - free .
Since 2006 , smoking in state offices , vehicles , and buildings ( except for correctional facilities ) has been banned by executive order issued by the Governor of Virginia .
A law which came into effect on July 1 , 2016 banned smoking in private cars with any occupants who are 8 years or younger .
In December 2013 , the Court of Appeals of Virginia held 100 % of the premises of a retail tobacco store that also operates a restaurant is exempt from Virginia 's 2009 smoking restrictions , and may allow smoking throughout the restaurant portion .
* Norfolk , March 25 , 2008 , repealed a ban on smoking in restaurants , which was passed in October 2007 but had not yet gone into effect , by City Council vote of 5–2 , because the City Attorney advised the Council that its ban would violate Virginia state law and could not withstand a legal challenge .
WASHINGTON
* Statewide smoking ban : On December 8 , 2005 , after ratification by a majority of Washington voters in a statewide initiative referendum , an amendment to Washington 's 1985 Clean Indoor Air Act became effective banning smoking statewide in all public places and places of employment in Washington ( except 25 % of hotel / motel rooms ) , as well as within of doors , windows , or ventilation intakes to such places .
The act exempts private enclosed workplaces and private residences except when being used to provide licensed childcare , foster care , adult care , or other similar social service care .
Washington does not provide exemptions for tobacconists or businesses whose sole purpose is to provide an environment for smoking ( e.g. hookah lounges , cigar bars ) .
However , private clubs in enclosed spaces with no employees , and businesses on tribal lands , are exempt .
Local governments may regulate smoking more stringently than the act , and local health boards are authorized to enforce the act locally .
* Mason County , banned in all enclosed workplaces , including bars and restaurants WEST VIRGINIA
* No statewide smoking ban .
Instead , West Virginia 's statewide smoking laws generally prohibit smoking in ( 1 ) public transportation vehicles where a " no smoking " sign is posted , ( 2 ) areas of public school except teacher 's lounges not accessible to students ( unless a local education board rules differently ) , ( 3 ) workplaces where a " no smoking " sign is posted , ( 4 ) areas near surface magazines for explosives used in mining , ( 5 ) mines and structures around mines , ( 6 ) nonsmoking sections in bingo halls , and ( 7 ) nonsmoking areas in nursing homes .
No West Virginia law requires the designation of nonsmoking areas generally in enclosed workplaces .
In 2003 , the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia ruled that county health boards may regulate smoking more stringently than the state , except in bingo halls and retirement homes .
As of April 2009 , 51 counties and two cities in West Virginia have enacted local smoking bans to varying degrees .
In 2008 , a proposed statewide smoking ban failed in the West Virginia Legislature .

The Act exempts only cigar bars or retail tobacco stores already in existence , private residences , and rooms in nursing homes in which the occupants agree to allow smoking ; it does not cover casinos run by American Indian tribes , as those casinos are in the tribes ' sovereign territory .
Local governments are preempted from regulating smoking more strictly than the Act .
Prior to this law taking effect , several localities in Wisconsin had local smoking bans in effect .
WYOMING
* No statewide smoking ban .
Instead , Wyoming state law only prohibits smoking where it could cause an explosion and in underground mines .
Wyoming has no state laws concerning indoor smoking in general , and thus local governments can regulate general indoor smoking as they see fit .
As of July 2017 , six cities in Wyoming have enacted local smoking bans , all covering all bars and restaurants , but varying otherwise .
In February 2009 , a bill before the Wyoming Legislature that would have enacted a statewide ban on smoking in all enclosed workplaces , except in private offices and in bars and restaurants serving only patrons over 21 years of age ( and except in any local community that chose to opt out ) failed when it was passed by the Wyoming House of Representatives in a vote of 31–29 but then was denied a committee hearing in the Wyoming Senate .

Section::::Slow Decomposition of Cigarettes .
In the United States alone there over 176,000,000 pounds of discarded cigarette butts per year .
Research has shown that cigarettes pose an extremely large threat to the environment and our wildlife .
Cigarettes contain small amounts of plastic that can not naturally decompose .
A study published in 2015 showed
that after two years only 38 % of a cigarette butt decomposes .
In addition to cigarette butt 's long composition time , the chemicals found within cigarette filters can remain in the soil for up to 10 years .
The problem created by cigarettes affects natural resources across the United States and poses a serious threat to the diverse wildlife population within it .
