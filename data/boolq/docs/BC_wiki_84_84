SCALLION Scallions ( also known as green onions , spring onions , or salad onions ) are vegetables of various Allium onion species .
Scallions have a milder taste than most onions .
Their close relatives include garlic , shallot , leek , chive , spring onion and Chinese onion .
Although the bulbs of many Allium species are used as food , the defining characteristic of scallion species is that they lack a fully developed bulb .
Allium species referred to as scallions have hollow , tubular green leaves growing directly from the bulb .
These leaves are used as a vegetable ; they are eaten either raw or cooked .
The leaves are often chopped into other dishes , in the manner of onions or garlic .
ETYMOLOGY Section::::Etymology .
The words scallion and shallot are related and can be traced back to the Greek ασκολόνιον ( ' askolonion ' ) as described by the Greek writer Theophrastus .
This name , in turn , seems to originate from the name of the ancient Canaan city of Ashkelon .
The plant itself came from farther east of Europe .
TYPES Section::::Types .
Species and cultivars that may be called " scallions " include :
* A. cepa * ' White Lisbon ' * ' White Lisbon Winter Hardy ' – an extra - hardy variety for overwintering
* Calçot * A. cepa var .
cepa – Most of the cultivars grown in the West primarily as scallions belong to this variety .
However , the " scallions " from A. cepa var .
cepa ( common onion ) are from a young plant , harvested before a bulb forms or sometimes after slight bulbing has occurred .
* A. cepa var .
aggregatum ( formerly A. ascalonicum ) – commonly called shallots or sometimes eschalot .
* A. chinense * A. fistulosum , the Welsh onion – does not form bulbs even when mature , and is grown in the West almost exclusively as a scallion or salad onion , although in Asia this species is of primary importance and used both fresh and cooked .
* A. × proliferum – sometimes used as scallions USES Section::::Uses .
Spring onions may be cooked or used raw as a part of salads , salsas or Asian recipes .
Diced scallions are used in soup , noodle and seafood dishes , sandwiches , curries and as part of a stir fry .
In many Eastern sauces , the bottom half - centimetre ( quarter - inch ) of the root is commonly removed before use .
In Mexico and the Southwest United States , cebollitas are scallions that are sprinkled with salt , grilled whole and eaten with cheese and rice .
Topped with lime juice , they are typically served as a traditional accompaniment to asado dishes .
In Catalan cuisine , calçot is a type of onion traditionally eaten in a calçotada ( plural : calçotades ) .
A popular gastronomic event of the same name is held between the end of winter and early spring , where calçots are grilled , dipped in salvitxada or romesco sauce , and consumed in massive quantities .
In Japan , scallions are cultivated in two ways .
In Western Japan , " leaf " green scallions are typically eaten , where only the green portion is consumed .
In Eastern Japan , " root " green scallions are popular .
The scallions are partially buried , so a portion of the stalk is kept underground .
As a result , a significant part of the stalk remains white in color , and is cultivated to be very thick .
The green portion of these " root " scallions are discarded , and the thick white portions of the scallion are consumed .
In Japanese cuisine , scallions are used in abundance , as an accompaniment to tofu , noodle dishes , hot pots and stir fries .
In Vietnam , Welsh onion is important to prepare dưa hành ( fermented onions ) which is served for Tết , the Vietnamese New Year .
A kind of sauce , mỡ hành ( Welsh onion fried in oil ) , is used in dishes such as cơm tấm , bánh ít and cà tím nướng .
Welsh onion is the main ingredient in the dish cháo hành , which is a rice porridge used to treat the common cold .
In India , it is eaten as an appetizer ( raw ) with main meals .
In north India , coriander , mint and onion chutney are made using uncooked scallions .
In the United Kingdom , scallions are normally chopped and added to mashed potatoes , or as an added ingredient to potato salad .
In the southern Philippines , it is ground in a mortar along with ginger and chili pepper to make a native condiment called wet palapa , which can be used to spice dishes or as a topping for fried or sun - dried food .
It can also be used to make the dry version of palapa , when it is stir fried with fresh coconut shavings and wet palapa .
During the Passover meal ( Seder ) , Persian Jews whack each other with scallions before singing the song Dayenu , symbolizing the whips endured by the Israelites under the ancient Egyptians .
An oil , scallion oil , is sometimes made from the green leaves .
The leaves are chopped and lightly cooked then emulsified in oil which is used as a garnish .
