PROMOTION ( CHESS ) Promotion is a chess rule that requires a pawn that reaches its eighth to be immediately replaced by the player 's choice of a queen , knight , rook , or bishop of the same .
The new piece replaces the pawn , as part of the same move .
The choice of new piece is not limited to pieces previously , thus promotion can result in a player owning , for example , two or more queens despite starting the game with one .
Pawn promotion , or the threat of it , often decides the result in an endgame .
Since the queen is the most powerful piece , the vast majority of promotions are to a queen .
Promotion to a queen is often called queening ; promotion to any other piece is referred to as underpromotion .
If the promoted piece is not physically available , FIDE rules state that the player should stop the game clock and summon the arbiter for the correct piece .
Under US Chess Federation rules and in casual play , an upside - down rook may be used to designate a queen .
PROMOTION TO VARIOUS PIECES Section::::Promotion to various pieces .
Promotion to a queen is the most common , since the queen is the most powerful piece .
Underpromotion ( promotion to a piece other than a queen ) occurs more often in chess problems than in practical play .
In practical play , underpromotions are rare , but not extraordinarily so ( see table below ) .
As the most powerful piece , the queen is usually the most desirable , but promotion to a different piece can be advantageous in certain situations .
A promotion to knight is occasionally useful , particularly if the knight can give immediate check .
A promotion to a rook is occasionally necessary to avoid a draw by immediate stalemate that would occur if the promotion was to a queen .
Promotion to a bishop almost never occurs in practical play ( about one game in 33,000 ) .
( See Underpromotion : Promotion to rook or bishop for examples of underpromotions to rook and bishop made in order to avoid stalemate . )
The percentage of games with promotions can be misleading , because often a player resigns when he sees that he can not stop his opponent from promoting a pawn .
In the 2006 ChessBase database of 3,200,000 games ( many at grandmaster or masterless than this .
A player may promote to any piece they wish , regardless of whether or not such a piece has been captured .
In theory , a player could have nine queens , ten knights , ten bishops or ten rooks , though these are highly improbable scenarios .
Some chess sets come with an extra queen of each color to use for promoted pawns .
If an extra queen is unavailable , it is often represented by an upside - down rook instead .
The diagram from the game between Bobby Fischer and Tigran Petrosian in the 1959 Candidates Tournament shows a position in which each side has two queens .
Four queens existed from move 37 until move 44 .
Very few games were played with six queens ; two examples are Emil Szalanczy – Nguyen Thi Mai ( 2009 ) and David Antón Guijarro – Alejandro Franco Alonso ( 2011 ) .
In the first game each side had three queens after move 58 until move 65 .
The game ended in a draw with a single queen on each side .
In the second game both sides also had three queens , but Black ultimately resigned , with a single queen on both sides .
STRATEGY Section::::Strategy .
The ability to promote is often the critical factor in endgames and thus is an important consideration in opening and middlegame strategy .
Almost all promotions occur in the endgame , but promotion in the middlegame does happen .
Promotion occasionally occurs even in the opening , often after one side makes a , as in the Lasker trap , which features an underpromotion to a knight on move seven : 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 d4 4.e3 ?

Q. HISTORY OF THE RULE Section::::History of the rule .
The original idea was that a foot soldier that advanced all the way through the enemy lines was promoted to the lowest rank of officer .
In the Middle Ages , the queen was much weaker than now , and its only allowed move was one square diagonally .
( It was earlier called farzin or ferz , from the Persian for " vizier " ) .
When the queen and bishop got their new moves , chess was radically altered .
When the fers became the queen , there were objections that a king should not have more than one queen .
At different times , the pawn could only promote to the piece of the file on which it promoted , or on which it started ( a queen if on the king 's file ) .
In Italy in the 18th and early 19th centuries , the pawn could only be promoted to a piece that had already been captured .
Likewise , Philidor did not like the possibility of having two queens , and in all editions of his book ( 1749 to 1790 )
he stated that a promotion could only be to a piece previously captured .
Lambe also stated this rule in a 1765 book .
If none of the promoting player 's pieces had yet been captured , the pawn remained inactive until one of the player 's pieces was captured , whereupon the pawn immediately assumed that role .
A player could thus never have two queens , three knights , three rooks , or three bishops .
One old set of chess rules said that " a promoted pawn became a ferz , with the move of the queen " .
The restricted promotion rule was applied inconsistently .
Jacob Sarratt 's 1828 book gave unrestricted promotion .
By Sarratt 's time , unrestricted promotion was popular , and according to Davidson it was universal by the mid-19th century .
However Howard Staunton wrote in The Chess - Player 's Handbook , originally published in 1847 , that according to Carl Jaenisch the restricted promotion rule was still in force in northern Europe , Russia , Scandinavia , and Germany .
1862 BRITISH CHESS ASSOCIATION RULE Section::::1862 British Chess Association rule .
Although the current rules of chess require a pawn that reaches the eighth rank to be promoted to a different piece , that was not always the case .
Wilhelm Steinitz , the first World Champion , in his 1889 work The Modern Chess Instructor , endorsed the then current " Code of Laws of the British Chess Association " .
In that code , Law XIII said , " When a pawn has reached the eighth square , the player has the option of selecting a piece , whether such piece has previously been lost or not , whose names and powers it shall then assume , or of deciding that it shall remain a pawn . "
( emphasis added ) .
Steinitz explained the purpose of this rule by referring to the position diagrammed at left , which he cited from Johann Löwenthal 's Book of the London Chess Congress , of 1862 : If White plays 1.bxa8=Q ? ?
( or any other promotion ) , Black wins with 1 ...
gxh3 , when White can not stop Black from checkmating him next move with 2 ... h2 .
Instead , White draws by 1.bxa8=P !
, when 1 ... gxh3 or 1 ...
Kxh3 stalemates White , and other moves allow 2.Bxg2 , with a drawn endgame .
Steinitz wrote , " We approve of the decision of the London Chess Congress , of 1862 , although the ' dummy ' pawn rule was denounced by some authorities . "
The same rule and explanation are given by George H. D. Gossip in The Chess - Player 's Manual .
The broad language of Law XIII also appears to allow promotion to any piece of either color .
This led to the whimsical joke chess problem diagrammed at right .
White is to play and checkmate in one move .
No solution is possible under modern - day rules , but with Law XIII in effect the surprising solution is 1.g8=(Black N ) ! , when the newly promoted knight blocks its own king 's flight square .
Presumably other amusing problems could be created involving promotion to a white or black king , which Law XIII also appears to allow .
Howard Staunton vigorously opposed the 1862 rule when it was proposed , but the tournament committee passed it by a large majority of votes .
However , it did not catch on .
Philip Sergeant wrote : A correspondent in the May [ 1865 ] Chess World ... did not exaggerate when he wrote that the B.C.A. Code had been very generally rejected by British amateurs , and emphatically condemned by the leading authorities of America , Germany , and France .
In particular , the absurd " dead Pawn " rule , against which Staunton had made his protest in 1862 , had failed to win acceptance .
The tournament book of the London 1883 international chess tournament ( originally published in 1883 ) contains a " Revised International Chess Code " , which was " published for the consideration of Chess Players , and especially of the managers of future International Tournaments " .
Unlike the 1862 rule , which allowed the pawn to remain a pawn , it requires that : " A Pawn reaching the eighth square must be named as a Queen or piece ... . "
UNDERPROMOTION Section::::Underpromotion .
Promotion to a knight , bishop , or rook is known as an " underpromotion " .
Although these pieces are less powerful than the queen , there are some situations where it is advantageous to underpromote .
UNDERPROMOTION TO A KNIGHT Section::::Underpromotion to a knight .
Since the knight moves in a way which the queen can not , knight underpromotions can be very useful , and are the most common type of underpromotion .
In the top diagram on the right , given by World Champion Emanuel Lasker , White has a huge material disadvantage .
Promotion to a queen ( by 1.exd8=Q ? ) would still leave Black ahead in material .
Instead , promotion to a knight with 1 .
exd8 = N+ !
wins by virtue of a fork : 1 ... K(any ) 2.Nxf7 followed by 3.Nxh8 leaves White a piece up with a winning endgame .
Promotion to knight may also be done for defensive reasons ; to the right is such a case , a 2006 game between Gata Kamsky and Étienne Bacrot .
White threatens to capture the pawn or checkmate by Rh1 if the black pawn promotes to a queen , rook , or bishop .
The only move that does not lose for Black is 74 ... e1 = N+ !
The resulting rook versus knight endgame is a theoretical draw ( see pawnless chess endgame ) .
In the actual game , mistakes were made in the rook versus knight endgame and White won on move 103 .
This is a standard defensive technique for the endgame of a rook versus a pawn .
valign="top
" + Zurakhov vs. Koblencs , Tbilisi 1956 Tim Krabbé points out that Zurakhov – Koblencs furnishes a very rare example of a game with two " serious " underpromotions to knight .
In the first diagram , Black threatens 57 ... Nxg7 , and if White avoided this by promoting to queen , rook , or bishop , Black would reach a drawn position with 57 ... Ne7
+ !
and 58 ...
Nxg8 .
The only winning move is 57 .
g8 =
N !
Krabbé notes that this is a rare example of a non - checking knight - promotion .
Twenty - one moves later , the players reached the position in the second diagram .
Once again , a promotion to anything other than a knight would be a blunder allowing a knight fork , e.g. 79.c8(Q ) ? ?
Nd6
+ and 80 ... Nxc8 , with a drawn ending .
White instead played 79 .
c8 = N+ !
( Here , there are other winning moves , such as 79.Kc5 . )
79
... Kb8 80 .
Kb6 and Black resigned , since White can not be stopped from promoting a third pawn — this time to a queen .
This was the 71st move of a game between Vladimir Akopian and Sergey Karjakin at Nalchik , 2009 .
After 71.a8(Q ) ?
? ,
71 ...
Qxb2 + , followed by alternating checks on the a and b files , would give Black a perpetual check , so Akopian played 71 .
a8 =
N ! , and Karjakin resigned , as 71 ...
Qxb2 + would be met by the cross - check 72.Nb6 + , which in turn forces 72 ...
Qxb6 + 73.Kxb6 , with an easy win for White .
An example of underpromotion to a knight occurred in the game Peter Svidler – Vladimir Malakhov , played at the FIDE World Cup in December 2009 at Khanty - Mansiysk in Siberia ( Slav Defense a6 ) : and White resigned because of 32.Rxe1 Qf2 + 33.Kh1 Ng3
# or 32.Kh2 Qxb2 + 33.Ne2 Qxe2
+ 34.Rf2 Qxf2 + 35.Kh1
Ng3 # .
If 31 ... dxe1 =
Q ? ?
, it is White who mates with 32.Bxf7 + Rxf7 33.Qxf7 + Kh8
34.Qf8 +
Kh7 35.Rf7 + Kg6 36.Qg8 + Kh6
37.Rh7
# . PROMOTION TO ROOK OR BISHOP ROOK UNDERPROMOTION
Section::::Promotion to rook or bishop .
Section::::Rook underpromotion .
Because the queen combines the powers of the rook and the bishop , there is rarely a reason to underpromote to either of those pieces .
However , doing so is occasionally advantageous , usually to avoid an immediate draw by stalemate if the promotion were to a queen .
In the position at left ( with White to move ) , Black threatens to capture White 's pawn ( which would be a draw ) , and a promotion to queen would be stalemate .
The move 1 .
g8 = R !
wins because White can force an elementary checkmate from the resulting position .
At right is a position from a 2006 game at the Irish Chess Championship .
Here too , a promotion to queen would allow stalemate :
70 ... b1 =
Q ? ?
71.Qh3
+ !
Kxh3 stalemate ( or 71 ... Kg1 72 .
Qh1
+ !
and now the black king is forced to capture ) .
Instead , the game concluded 70 ... b1
= R !
Less often , underpromotion to rook may be necessary not to avoid stalemate , but to induce it and thus save a draw in an otherwise hopeless position .
To the right is an example from the end of a study by Frédéric Lazard .
Black threatens checkmate by moving the king and playing ... Bf4 .
Promotion to queen does not work on account of 1.d8 =
Q ?
Bf4
2.Qd2
+ Kf3 3.Qxf4 +
Kxf4 and Black promotes either the c - pawn or the h - pawn .
Promotion to rook saves the draw , however , as after 1 .
d8 = R !
Bf4 2 .
Rd2
( if 1 ... Bxh2 , then 2.Rd3
+ ! ) , king moves by Black cause stalemate as the rook is absolutely pinned , and bishop moves along the c1–h6 diagonal can be parried by attacking the bishop with the rook : 2 ... Bg5 3 .
Rd5
Kf4 4 .
Rd2 Bh6
5 .
Rd6 Kg5
6 .
Rd2 is one possible continuation .
BISHOP UNDERPROMOTION Section::::Bishop underpromotion .
In the position at left , promotion to a queen or rook would pin the bishop , leaving Black with no possible move , resulting in a stalemate .
Promotion to bishop is the only winning move : 1 . c8 = B !
B\any 2 . Nd7
B\any 3 . Bb7
# .
( Promotion to knight threatens checkmate via 2.Nb6 , but that is thwarted by 1 ... Bc7 2.Nb6 + Bxb6 3.Kxb6 , with a drawn game by insufficient mating material . )
Less often , underpromotion to bishop may be necessary not to avoid stalemate , but to induce it and thus save a draw in an otherwise hopeless position .
To the right is an example from the end of a study by Herman Mattison .
Both king moves lose quickly ( they can be met by ...
Rgg7 , for example ) , so the pawn must be promoted .
6.b8 = Q and 6.b8
= R both lose to a capture on c8 , and 6.b8 = N , while leaving a stalemate after 6 ...
Rgxc8 ? ?
, loses quickly after 6 ...
Rcxc8 .
This only leaves 6 .
b8 = B !
: since the c7 rook is now pinned , Black must either lose it with a theoretical draw or play 6 ...
Rxc8 which , with a bishop on b8 rather than a queen or rook , is stalemate .
Underpromotion to knight or rook in practical play is rare , and to bishop is even rarer , but in composed chess problems such as this last example , it occurs more often .
Perhaps the most famous example is the Saavedra position .
Some cases can be quite spectacular : a study by Jan Rusinek , for example , sees White promoting to knight , bishop and rook in order to induce stalemate .
An Allumwandlung is a problem where promotions to all four possible pieces occur .
An extreme example is the Babson task , where underpromotions by Black are countered by matching underpromotions by White ( so if Black promotes to a rook , so does White , and so on ) , White 's underpromotions being the only way to mate Black in the stipulated number of moves .
In the 1972 game between Aron Reshko and Oleg Kaminsky , promotion to a queen or rook would allow 61 ... Qf7 + 62.Qxf7 stalemate .
White could promote to a knight , but that would not be sufficient to win .
White wins after :
If 62.Bc6 Qa2 63.Bd7
Qg8 64.Qxg8 +
Kxg8 65.Kg6 also wins Black is in zugzwang for two moves .
In the actual game , White promoted to a knight .
White won the game because of an error by Black .
In the 1938 ( or 1933 ) game between Alexey Sokolsky and Grigory Ravinsky , promotion to a queen or rook would allow 66 ...
Rc2 +
67.Ka1
( 67.Kxc2 is a stalemate )
Rc1
+ with a draw by perpetual check .
Promotion to a knight also draws because of the position of Black 's king , with 66 ... Rc8 !
67.Ra6 Rxa8 68.Rxa8 stalemate .
However , the move 66 .
a8 = B ! , which was played in the game , wins for White , with the following main variations : INSIGNIFICANT UNDERPROMOTIONS Section::::Insignificant underpromotions .
A majority of underpromotions in practical play are , as Tim Krabbé puts it , " silly jokes"—underpromotions made where there is no real need to do so .
A recent high - level example was the game Shirov – Kramnik , Amber Blindfold , 2005 .
In the diagrammed position , Black played 25 ... e1 = B+ .
This underpromotion is completely inconsequential as both it and 25 ... e1 = Q+
force 26.Qxe1 .
In 1932 , a long game between Milan Vidmar and Géza Maróczy had been a theoretical draw for many moves , because of the opposite - colored bishops endgame .
Two underpromotions to bishops occurred on successive moves by White :
The game was drawn on move 129 .
UNUSUAL SITUATION
Section::::Unusual situation .
An unusual situation occurred in a 1993 game between Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov .
Karpov was in serious time trouble , with one minute to make 16 moves .
In this position , Kasparov captured the rook on d1 with the pawn on c2 , and said " Queen ! " , indicating that the promoted piece was a queen .
However , no queen was immediately available .
It took some time for the arbiter to come up with a black queen .
Kasparov said that if he had been attentive , he would have promoted to a rook , which was available .
Kasparov 's clock was running while the arbiter was getting a queen , so he started Karpov 's clock .
Karpov immediately played 25.Qxe4 and Kasparov told him that he was in check .
Karpov replied " From what ?
It might be a bishop on d1 .
" The clocks were stopped .
The arbiter found a black queen , the game was backed up to the position after 24 ... cxd1 =
Q+ ,
and Karpov was given an extra two minutes on his clock because of Kasparov 's illegal move ( since starting
the opponent 's clock signified the completion of his move , which was not possible without a piece to promote to ) .
Kasparov disputes that he made an illegal move .
Kasparov soon won the game , however .
PROMOTION IN OTHER GAMES OF THE CHESS FAMILY Section::::Promotion in other games of the chess family .
In shogi , all but two of the eight piece types can promote , but only to a particular piece ( indicated by flipping the piece to show the character on its reverse ) ; two of these pieces are available only by promotion .
Promotion may occur when a piece makes a move wholly or partially within the three furthest ranks of the board , but whether or not to promote the piece is at the discretion of the player ( unless it is a forward - moving piece that has advanced too far forward to be able to move again , in which case promotion is mandatory ) .
When a promoted piece is captured and dropped , it returns to its unpromoted state .
In xiangqi , pawns gain additional movement after crossing to the board 's other side , but this is not usually labelled promotion .
In most chess variants , promotion is allowed to any non- that is on the board at the start of the game .
In variants where there are no royal pieces ( i.e. the objective of the game is not checkmate ) , such as suicide chess , promotions to king may be permitted .
As noted , at one time promotion was not mandatory , and the player could choose to have a pawn reaching the eighth rank remain a pawn .
In some fairy chess variants , promotions to pieces of the opponent 's color are also possible .
