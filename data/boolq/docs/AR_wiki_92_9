FIVE POUNDS ( BRITISH COIN )
The British five pound ( £ 5 ) coin is a commemorative denomination of the pound sterling .
Its obverse has featured the profile of Queen Elizabeth II since the coin 's introduction in 1990 .
Two different portraits of the Queen have graced the coin , with the latest design by Ian Rank - Broadley being introduced in 1998 .
The coin has no standard reverse ; instead it is altered each year to commemorate important events .
Variant obverses have also been used on occasion .
The coin is a continuation of the crown , which after decimalisation become the commemorative twenty - five pence coin .
The twenty - five pence was discontinued in 1981 after creating a large coin with such small value became prohibitively expensive .
The five pound coin shares the same dimensions as the twenty - five pence coin , and the five shilling coin before it , but has a value twenty times greater .
Five pound coins are legal tender but are intended as souvenirs and are rarely seen in circulation .
The coins are sold by the Royal Mint at face value and also , with presentation folders , at a premium to that face value .
The 2010 coins , with such folders , were sold for £ 9.95 each .
