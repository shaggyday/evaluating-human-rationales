ROSE BOWL ( STADIUM )
The Rose Bowl , also known as Spieker Field at the Rose Bowl , is an American outdoor athletic stadium , located in Pasadena , California , a northeast suburb of Los Angeles .
Opened in October 1922 , the stadium is recognized as a National Historic Landmark and a California Historic Civil Engineering landmark .
At a modern capacity of an all - seated configuration at 90,888 ( making it one of the rare stadiums in college football to have such a seating arrangement ; many such stadiums have bench - style seating )
the Rose Bowl is the 17th - largest stadium in the world , the 11th - largest stadium in the United States , and the 10th largest NCAA stadium .
One of the most famous venues in sporting history , the Rose Bowl is best known as a college football venue , specifically as the host of the annual Rose Bowl Game for which it is named .
Since 1982 , it has also served as the home stadium of the UCLA Bruins football team .
The stadium has also hosted five Super Bowl games , second most of any venue .
The Rose Bowl is also a noted soccer venue , having hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup Final , 1999 FIFA
Women 's World Cup Final , and the 1984 Olympic Gold Medal Match , as well as numerous CONCACAF and United States Soccer Federation matches .
The stadium and adjacent Brookside Golf and Country Club are owned by the city of Pasadena and managed by the Rose Bowl Operating Company , a non - profit organization whose board is selected by council members of the city of Pasadena .
UCLA and the Pasadena Tournament of Roses also have one member on the company board .
HISTORY DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION Section::::History . Section::::Design and construction .
The game now known as the Rose Bowl Game was played at Tournament Park though January 1922 , about southeast , adjacent to the campus of the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) .
The Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association , the game 's organizer , realized the temporary stands were inadequate for a crowd of more than 40,000 , and sought to build a better , permanent stadium .
The stadium was designed by architect Myron Hunt in 1921 .
His design was influenced by the Yale Bowl in New Haven , Connecticut , which opened in 1914 .
The Arroyo Seco was selected as the location for the stadium .
The Rose Bowl was under construction from Feb. 27 , 1922 to October 1922 .
The nearby Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum also was under construction during this time and would be completed in May 1923 , shortly after the Rose Bowl was completed .
Originally built as a horseshoe , the stadium was expanded several times .
The southern stands were completed in 1928 , enclosing the stadium into a complete bowl .
The field 's alignment is nearly north - south , offset slightly northwest , and the elevation at street level is approximately above sea level .
The stadium 's name was alternatively " Tournament of Roses Stadium " or " Tournament of Roses Bowl " , until being settled as " Rose Bowl " before the 1923 Rose Bowl game , in reference to the unusually named ( at the time )
Yale Bowl .
The stadium is extremely difficult to access due to the traffic caused by single - lane residential street access .
It has no dedicated parking lot for visitors and parking issues have routinely caused visitors to spend two to three hours completing the last mile to the stadium on game days .
In 2016 , Rose Bowl contracted ParkJockey to streamline parking in and around the stadium .
There are also shuttles to help visitors get to the stadium and mobile lights powered by generators to provide visibility for people walking on the golf course at night .
DEDICATION , OCTOBER 1922 Section::::Dedication , October 1922 .
The first game was a regular season contest in 1922 , when California defeated USC on October 28 .
This was the only loss for USC and Cal finished the season undefeated .
California declined the invitation to the 1923 Rose Bowl game and USC went instead .
The stadium was dedicated officially on January 1 , 1923 , when USC defeated Penn State SEATING Section::::Seating .
The stadium seating has been reconfigured several times since its construction in 1922 .
The South end was filled in to complete the bowl and more seats have been added .
The original wooden benches were replaced by aluminum benches in 1969 .
All new grandstand and loge seats had been installed since 1971 .
New red seat backs had been added on 22,000 seats prior to the 1980 Rose Bowl .
A Rose Bowl improvement was conducted because of UCLA 's 1982 move and the 1984 Summer Olympics .
This resulted in new seat backs for 50,000 seats .
For many years , the Rose Bowl had the largest football stadium capacity in the United States , eventually being surpassed by Michigan Stadium ( 107,601 ) .
The Rose Bowl 's maximum stated seating capacity was 104,091 from 1972 to 1997 .
Some of the seats closest to the field were never used during this time for UCLA regular season games , and were covered by tarps .
Official capacity was lowered following the 1998 Rose Bowl .
Slightly different figures are given for the current capacity , for the lower level seats behind the team benches are not used for some events since the spectators can not see through the standing players or others on the field .
UCLA reports the capacity at 91,136 .
The Tournament of Roses reports the capacity at 92,542 .
The 2006 Rose Bowl game , which was also the BCS championship game , had a crowd of 93,986 .
In the 2011 contest between TCU and Wisconsin , the listed attendance is 94,118 .
As of 2008 , the Rose Bowl is the 11th largest football stadium , and is still the largest stadium that hosts post - season bowl games .
For concerts held there , the Rose Bowl holds almost 60,000 people .
The stadium 's 2014 remodeling removed the lower " lettered row " seats on each side behind the players ' benches and provide access in and out of the stadium for the lower sections of the Rose Bowl , restoring its original design .
STADIUM RENOVATIONS Section::::Stadium renovations .
The press box was updated before the 1962 Rose Bowl with an elevator and two rows .
The cost was $ 356,000 .
The Press Box was refurbished for UCLA 's move in 1982 and the 1984 Summer Olympics .
In 2011 and 2012 , the press box was undergoing renovation as part of the larger renovation originally budgeted at $ 152 million in 2010 .
Costs had increased to $ 170 million during construction .
Work proceeded during the 2011 football season , and was expected to be completed before the UCLA Bruins ' first home game in 2012 .
Some unforeseen problems had been encountered due to the stadium 's age and some renovations done in the early 1990s .
Most of the planned renovations were completed in 2013 .
Because of the increased construction cost , items deferred for the future are additional new restrooms , the historic field hedge , new entry gate structures , and additional new concession stands .
The stadium has started " The Brick Campaign " to help pay for some of the cost of the renovations .
The Brick Campaign , completed in 2014 , features a large logo of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses and the donor bricks arranged by universities in front of the south main entrance to the stadium .
A large 30 feet tall by 77 feet wide LED video display board was added to the north end of the stadium as a part of the renovation .
COURT OF CHAMPIONS Section::::Court of Champions .
The Court of Champions is at the stadium 's south end .
Rose Bowl game records along with the names of the coaches and the MVP players , are shown on the plaques attached to the exterior wall .

The stadium 's name has given rise to the term " bowl game " for postseason football games , regardless of whether they are played in a bowl - shaped or " Bowl"-named stadium .
The Rose Bowl Game is commonly referred to as " The Granddaddy of Them All " because of its stature as the oldest of all the bowl games .
Since its opening , the Rose Bowl stadium has hosted the bowl game every year except the 1942 Rose Bowl , when the game was moved to Durham , North Carolina , at the campus of Duke University .
Duke , which played in the game on January 1 , volunteered to host the contest because of security concerns on the West Coast in the weeks following the attack on Pearl Harbor .

The Rose Bowl stadium has been the home football field for UCLA since 1982 .
The UCLA Bruins had played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum since 1928 .
There was an attempt to build a 44,000 seat stadium on campus , at the site where Drake Stadium eventually was built .
However , the proposal was blocked by influential area residents , as well as other politicians .
At the start of the 1982 NFL season , with the Oakland Raiders scheduled to move in , UCLA decided to relocate its home games to the Rose Bowl Stadium .
The Bruins went on to play two straight Rose Bowl games in their new home stadium , the 1983 Rose Bowl and the 1984 Rose Bowl .
UCLA has participated in five Rose Bowl games since moving to the stadium .
The stadium is the host of the UCLA – USC rivalry football game on even numbered years , alternating with the Coliseum .
In the first rivalry game at the stadium between UCLA and USC in 1982 , USC fans sat on the west side of the stadium and UCLA fans sat on the east side of the stadium , mirroring an arrangement that existed when the teams shared the Coliseum .
Both teams also wore their home uniforms .
In 1984 , USC fans were moved to the end zone seats , which ended the tradition of shared stadium .
Because of the shared arrangement , and the participation of USC in a number of Rose Bowl games , both schools have winning records in each other 's home stadium .
The Bruins travel 26 miles from campus to Pasadena to play home games , but only 14 miles to their biggest road game at USC every other year .

PRESENT
STATUS Section::::Present status .
The Rose Bowl and adjacent golf course are managed by the Rose Bowl Operating Company , a non - profit organization whose board is selected by council members of the City of Pasadena .
UCLA and the Pasadena Tournament of Roses also have one member on the company board .
The Rose Bowl stadium itself runs on a yearly operational loss .
While it generates funds with the annual lease with UCLA ( $ 1.5 million ) , the Tournament of Roses ( $ 900,000 ) , and a regularly hosted flea market ( $ 900,000 ) , it makes up the loss by relying on funds generated by the adjacent city - owned golf course ( $ 2 million ) .
While the stadium is able to keep operating in this financial set - up , it is unable to finance many of the capital improvements it needs to be considered a modern facility , including new seats , wider aisles , additional exits , a wider concourse , a renovated press box , a state - of - the - art video scoreboard , new field lighting , additional suites and a club .
The estimated cost for such improvements ranges from $ 250 million and $ 300 million .
The stadium currently has long - term leases with its two major tenants , the Pasadena Tournament of Roses ( 2019 ) and UCLA ( 2023 ) .
In 2006 , the Rose Bowl and the City of Pasadena launched a $ 16.3 million capital improvement program that will benefit both UCLA and the Tournament of Roses .
New locker rooms for both UCLA and visiting teams , as well as a new media interview area were constructed .
In April 2009 , The Rose Bowl Operating Company unveiled a Rose Bowl Strategic Plan , which addressed the objectives to improve public safety ; enhance fan experience ; maintain national historic landmark status ; develop revenue sources to fund long - term improvements ; and enhance facility operations .
On October 11 , 2010 , the Pasadena City Council approved a $ 152 million financing plan for the major renovation of the stadium .
Groundbreaking ceremonies for the first of three phases of the project was held on January 25 , 2011 .
The newly constructed video board was used for the June 25 , 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup
Final .
NFL Section::::NFL .
Since losing both its local teams in the Los Angeles market in 1995 , the National Football League had been looking to either start or relocate a franchise to the Los Angeles area .
One of the strong candidates was a renovated Rose Bowl .
However , after many years of varying offers , no deal could be struck between the NFL owners , the stadium 's owner , and the City of Pasadena , following a vote of disapproval by its residents in November 2006 .
On November 19 , 2012 , Pasadena officials approved a proposal which could allow an NFL team to temporarily play in the Rose Bowl .
The Rose Bowl , however , has not acted as a home field for an NFL team .
When the Los Angeles Rams moved from St. Louis prior to the 2016 NFL season , the Rose Bowl was considered as a temporary home before the Rams ultimately settled on playing in USC 's Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum , the Rams ' home from 1946 to 1979 .
