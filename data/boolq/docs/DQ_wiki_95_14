HISTORY Section::::History .
Succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples had lived in the area for thousands of years .
At the time of European contact , the Lenape ( Delaware ) nation inhabited western Long Island .
By 1600 the band inhabiting the local area was called the Matinecock after their location , but they were Lenape people .
Following European colonization , the area became part of the colony of New Netherland .
In 1639 , the Dutch West India Company made its first purchase of land on Long Island from the local Native Americans .
The English also had colonies on Long Island at this time .
The Dutch did not dispute English claims to what is now Suffolk County , but when settlers from New England arrived in ( present - day )
Oyster Bay in 1640 , they were soon arrested as part of a boundary dispute .
In 1643 , Englishmen purchased land in the present - day town of Hempstead from the Indians that included land purchased by the Dutch in 1639 .
Nevertheless , in 1644 , the Dutch director granted a patent for Hempstead to the English .
The Dutch also granted other English settlements in Flushing , Newtown , and Jamaica .
In 1650 , the Treaty of Hartford established a boundary between Dutch and English claims at " Oysterbay " , by which the Dutch meant present - day Cold Spring Harbor ( to the east ) and the English meant all of the water connected to present - day Oyster Bay Harbor .
Meanwhile , the government of England came under the control of Oliver Cromwell as a republic , and smugglers took advantage of the unresolved border dispute .
In 1653 , English settlers made their first purchase of land in Oyster Bay from the local Matinecock tribe , though there were already some rogue English settlements there .
For this purchase , the English settlers paid to the Native American Moheness ( aka Assiapum ) , " six kettles , six fathoms of wampum , six hoes , six hatchets , three pairs of stockings , thirty awl - blades or muxes , twenty knives , three shirts and as much Peague as will amount to four pounds sterling .
" The monarchy was restored in England in 1660 , and in 1664 King Charles gave Long Island ( and much else ) to his brother James , leading to the Dutch relinquishing control of all of New Amsterdam .
In 1667 the settlement at Oyster Bay received its charter from the new English colony of New York , becoming the Township of Oyster Bay .
By 1687 , the last piece of land was sold by the Indians , and few remained by 1709 .
During most of the American Revolution the town was under the control of British forces .
The town was originally part of Queens County , until the western portion of that county was amalgamated into New York City in 1898 and Nassau County was created in 1899 .
In 1918 Glen Cove , to the west , incorporated as a city and formed a governing system separate from the town .
Following World War II , housing replaced farmland as the population grew from about 40,000 in 1950 to more than 290,000 in 1990 .
Oyster Bay is home to the Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club , one of the oldest yacht clubs in the Western Hemisphere , which opened in 1871 .
There are 40 buildings and sites presently named Town of Oyster Bay Landmarks .
