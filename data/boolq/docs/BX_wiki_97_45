WINDOWS MOVIE MAKER Windows Movie Maker ( formerly known as Windows Live Movie Maker in Windows 7 ) was a video editing software by Microsoft .
It was a part of Windows Essentials software suite and offered the ability to create and edit videos as well as to publish them on OneDrive , Facebook , Vimeo , YouTube , and Flickr .
Movie Maker was officially discontinued on January 10 , 2017 and it is replaced by Windows Story Remix which is built in with Microsoft Photos in Windows 10 .
HISTORY INITIAL RELEASES Section::::History .
Section::::Initial releases .
The first release of Windows Movie Maker was included with Windows ME on September 14 , 2000 .
Version 1.1 was included in Windows XP a year later , and included support for creating DV AVI and WMV 8 files .
Version 2.0 was released as a free update in November 2002 , and added a number of new features .
Version 2.1 , a minor update , is included in Windows XP Service Pack 2 .
The Movie Maker in Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 had more transitions and support for DVD burning .
WINDOWS VISTA
Section::::Windows Vista .
The next version of Movie Maker was released as part of Windows Vista and – like most Windows components – reported version number 6.0.6000 , same as Windows Vista itself .
It included new effects and transitions , support for playback on the Xbox 360 , and support for the DVR - MS file format that Windows Media Centre records television in .
The HD version in Premium and Ultimate editions of Windows Vista also added support for capturing from HDV camcorders .
The capture wizard also created DVR - MS type files from HDV tapes .
However , the Windows Vista version of Windows Movie Maker removed support for importing video from an analog video source such as an analog camcorder , VCR or from a webcam .
As some older systems might not be able to run the new version of Windows Movie Maker , Microsoft also released an updated older version 2.6 for Windows Vista on Microsoft Download Centre .
This version included the old effects and transitions , and is basically the same as Windows Movie Maker 2.1 , but without the ability to capture video .
Installation requires Windows Vista and is only intended for use on computers where the hardware accelerated version can not be run .
A Windows Presentation Foundation ( WPF ) version of Windows Movie Maker was also included in some development builds of Vista ( at the time codenamed " Longhorn " ) , but was removed in the development reset in August 2004 .
After the development reset , the interface for the WPF - based Windows Movie Maker was retained in Windows Vista .
WINDOWS LIVE
Section::::Windows Live .
A new version of the software , renamed Windows Live Movie Maker 2009 , was released as a beta on September 17 , 2008 , and officially released as a standalone product through Windows Live Essentials suite on August 19 , 2009 .
This was effectively a completely new software , as it could not read projects created by earlier versions and did not support custom XML transitions written for the previous versions .
In addition , a great many features were removed .
Also , Movie Maker 's interface was redesigned in the Windows Live version to use a ribbon toolbar similar to Office 2007 ; it also added features such as " Auto Movie " and the ability to export videos directly to DVDs and YouTube .
Certain advanced features were also removed from the software , such as image stabilisation and the ability to record voice - overs .
Movie Maker 2009 supported both Windows Vista and Windows 7 .
As the previous version of Windows Movie Maker was no longer included with the operating system , the only way to obtain Movie Maker on Windows 7 and later was through the Windows Live Essentials suite , although some manufacturers pre - installed the application on new PCs .
An updated version , Windows Live Movie Maker 2011 , was released on August 17 , 2010 , adding features such as webcam capture , support for high - definition video , the ability to upload videos directly to SkyDrive and Facebook , and the ability to add media files stored on network shares to projects .
2012
Section::::2012 .
With the discontinuation of the Windows Live brand ( and the re - branding of the Windows Live suite as Windows Essentials ) , Windows Movie Maker 2012 was released in April 2012 .
Support for recording voice - overs was restored , along with an audio mixer and integration with several free stock music services .
H.264 / MP4 became the default export format ( replacing Windows Media Video , but still can be used ) , support for uploading to Vimeo was introduced , and hardware accelerated video stabilisation was also added as an exclusive feature for Windows 8 users .
DISCONTINUATION AND REPLACEMENT Section::::Discontinuation and replacement .
Movie Maker was officially removed for download on January 10 , 2017 .
Like other Windows Essentials apps , Movie Maker is now replaced by Windows Story Remix in Windows 10 's Photos App .
LAYOUT Section::::Layout .
The layout consists of a storyboard view and a timeline view , collections for organizing imported video , and a preview pane .
When in Storyboard view , the video project appears as a film strip showing each scene in clips .
The storyboard / timeline consists of one ' Video ' ( with accompanying ' Audio ' bar ) , one ' Music / Audio ' bar , and one ' Titles / Credits ' bar .
In each bar , clips can be added for editing ( e.g. , a .WAV music file will belong on the ' Music / Audio ' bar ) .
Still images can also be imported into the timeline and " stretched " to any desired number of frames .
The Video and Music / Audio bars can be " cut " to any number of short segments , which will play together seamlessly , but the individual segments are isolated editing - wise , so that for example , the music volume can be lowered for just a few seconds while someone is speaking .
IMPORTING FOOTAGE
Section::::Importing footage .
When importing footage into the program , a user can either choose to Capture Video ( from camera , scanner or other device ) or Import into Collections to import existing video files into the user 's collections .
The accepted formats for import are .WMV/.ASF , .MPG
( MPEG-1 ) ,
.AVI
( DV - AVI ) , .WMA , .WAV , and .MP3 .
Additionally , the Windows Vista Home Premium and Ultimate editions of Movie Maker support importing MPEG-2 Program streams and DVR - MS formats .
Importing of other container formats such as MP4/3GP , FLV and MOV , and AAC are also supported if the necessary codecs are installed and the system is running Windows 7 or later .
In the XP version , import and real - time capture of video from an analog source such as a VCR , tape - based analog camcorder or webcam is possible .
This feature is based on Windows Image Acquisition .
Video support in Windows Image Acquisition was removed in Windows Vista , as a result importing analog footage in Windows Movie Maker is no longer possible .
When importing from a DV tape , if the " Make Clips on Completion " option is selected , Windows Movie Maker automatically flags the commencement of each scene , so that the tape appears on the editing screen as a collection of short clips , rather than one long recording .
That is , at each point where the " Record " button was pressed , a new " clip " is generated , although the actual recording on the hard drive is still one continuous file .
This feature is also offered after importing files already on the hard drive .
In the Windows Vista version , the " Make clips on completion " option has been removed — the clips are now automatically created during the capture process .
The efficiency of the importing and editing process is heavily dependent on the amount of file fragmentation of the hard disk .
The most reliable results can be obtained by adding an extra hard disk dedicated for scratch space , and regularly re - formatting / defragmenting it , rather than simply deleting the files at the end of the project .
Fragmented AVI files result in jerky playback on the editing screen , and make the final rendering process much longer .
Although it is possible to import digital video from cameras through the USB interface , most older cameras only support USB version 1 and the results tend to be poor — " sub VHS " — quality .
Newer cameras using USB 2.0 give much better results .
A FireWire interface camera will allow recording and playback of images identical in quality to the original recordings if the video is imported and subsequently saved as DV AVI files , although this consumes disk space at about 1 gigabyte every five minutes ( 12 GB / Hr ) .
Alternatively , most DV cameras allow the final AVI file to be recorded back onto the camera tape for high quality playback .
Some standalone DVD recorders will also directly accept DV inputs from video cameras and computers .
EDITING AND OUTPUT Section::::Editing and output .
After capture , any clip can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the timeline .
Once on the timeline , clips can be duplicated , split , repositioned or edited .
An AutoMovie feature offers predefined editing styles ( titles , effects and transitions ) for quickly creating movies .
The original camera file on the hard drive is not modified ; the project file is just a list of instructions for reproducing a final output video file from the original file .
Thus , several different versions of the same video can be simultaneously made from the original camera footage .
Earlier versions of Windows Movie Maker could only export video in Windows Media Video or DV AVI formats .
It includes some predefined profiles , but users can also create custom profiles .
Windows XP Media Centre Edition bundled Sonic DVD Burning engine , licensed from Sonic Solutions , allowing video editors to burn their project in DVD - Video format on a DVD .
In Windows Vista , Windows Movie Maker passes the video project to Windows DVD Maker .
Windows Movie Maker 2012 introduced the default ability to export in H.264 MP4 format .
Video can be exported back to the video camera if supported by the camera .
Movie Maker also allows users to publish a finished video on video hosting websites .
Windows Movie Maker can also be used to edit and publish audio tracks .
If no video or image is present , Movie Maker allows exporting the sound clips in Windows Media Audio format .
EFFECTS AND TRANSITIONS Section::::Effects and transitions .
Windows Movie Maker supports a large variety of titles , effects and transitions .
* Titles are animated text screens , normally placed at the beginning or end of the movie , but can also be placed over video clips .
Titles and credits can be added as stand alone titles or overlaying them on the clip by adding them onto the selected clip .
Titles range from static ( non - animated ) titles to fly in , fading , news banner , or spinning newspaper animations .
They can also be placed on video clips to create sub - titles .
* Transitions affect how one video clips flows into another .
Examples include fade and dissolve , but many more spectacular transitions are available .
* Effects alter how a video clip appears .
Example include allowing control of brightness , contrast or hue , but other more dramatic effects are available , such as giving an ' old time ' flickering black and white feel .
Versions 2.x included in Windows XP
includes 60 transitions , 37 effects , 34 title and 9 credits animations .
The Windows Vista version includes a different set of transitions , effects and title / credits animations while dropping a few older ones .
There are in all 49 effects and 63 transitions .
They are applied by using a drag and drop interface from the effects or transitions folders .
Early versions ( V2 onwards ) of Windows Movie Maker had a flexible interface so programming custom effects and other content were possible via XML .
The Windows Vista version supports Direct3D - based effects .
Microsoft also provides SDK documentation for custom effects and transitions .
Since the effects are XML based , users could create and add custom effects and transitions of their own with XML knowledge .
Many custom transitions were commercially available and created additional features such as picture - in - picture .
Windows Movie Maker V6 did not support customisations to effects and transitions in the same way as V2.x and so many customisations had to be re - written .
Versions after V6 do not support custom transitions and effects at all .
RECEPTION AND CRITICISM Section::::Reception and criticism .
Movie Maker 1.0 , introduced with Windows Me , was widely criticised for being " bare bones " and suffering " a woeful lack of features " ; and saving movies only in Microsoft 's ASF file format .
Critical reception of versions 2.0 and 2.6 has been slightly more positive .
Many longstanding users were disappointed by the removal of so many features in the effective re - writing of the software in Live Movie Maker 2009 .
Some of those features ( such as visualisation of the audio levels ) have subsequently been re - added .
In June 2008 , a memo purportedly by Bill Gates from January 2003 was circulated on the Internet in which he heavily criticized the downloading process for Movie Maker at the time .
The memo was originally made available online as part of the plaintiffs ' evidence in Comes v. Microsoft Corp. , an antitrust class - action suit , and was submitted as evidence in that case on January 16 , 2007 .
