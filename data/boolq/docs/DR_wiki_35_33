OHIO STATE BUCKEYES FOOTBALL
The Ohio State Buckeyes football team is a college football team that competes as part of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision , representing Ohio State University in the East Division of the Big Ten Conference .
Ohio State has played their home games at Ohio Stadium in Columbus , Ohio since 1922 .
The Buckeyes are recognized by the university and NCAA as having won eight national championships along with 39 conference championships ( including 37 Big Ten titles ) , seven division championships , 10 undefeated seasons , and six perfect seasons ( no losses or ties ) .
As of 2017 , the football program is valued at $ 1.5 billion , the highest valuation of any such program in the country .
The first Ohio State game was a 20–14 victory over Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware , Ohio , on May 3 , 1890 .
The team was a football independent from 1890 to 1901 before joining the Ohio Athletic Conference ( OAC ) as a charter member in 1902 .
The Buckeyes won two conference championships while members of the OAC and in 1912 became members of the Big Ten Conference .
Ohio State won their first national championship in 1942 under head coach Paul Brown .
Following World War II , Ohio State saw sparse success on the football field with three separate coaches and in 1951 hired Woody Hayes to coach the team .
Under Hayes , Ohio State won over 200 games , 13 Big Ten championships and five national championships ( 1954 , 1957 , 1961 , 1968 , and 1970 ) , and had four Rose Bowl wins in eight appearances .
Following Hayes ' dismissal in 1978 , Earle Bruce and later John Cooper coached the team to a combined seven conference championships between them .
Jim Tressel was hired as head coach in 2001 and led Ohio State to its seventh national championship in 2002 .
Under Tressel , Ohio State won seven Big Ten championships and appeared in eight Bowl Championship Series ( BCS ) games , winning five of them .
In November 2011 , Urban Meyer became head coach .
Under Meyer , the team went 12–0 in his first season and set a school record with 24 consecutive victories , won three Big Ten championships ( 2014 , 2017 , and 2018 ) , and won the first College Football Playoff National Championship of its kind in 2014 .
HISTORY BEGINNINGS ( 1890–1933 ) Section::::History .
Section::::Beginnings ( 1890–1933 ) .
After early attempts at forming a team in 1886 ( led by future Nebraska governor Chester Hardy Aldrich ) and 1887 , football was ultimately established at the university in 1890 .
On the site of the first OSU game , on the campus of Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware , Ohio , on May 3 , 1890 , the Delaware County Historical Society has set an historical marker .
Some histories of Ohio State football credit George Cole , an undergraduate , and Alexander S. Lilley with introducing the sport to the campus .
More recent research has challenged that claim , stating that George Cole persuaded Lilley to coach the football team during its first full season that fall .
OSU 's first home game took place at 2:30 p.m. on November 1 , 1890 .
They played the University of Wooster on the site that was then called Recreation Park .
Just east of historic German Village , the park occupied the north side of Schiller ( now Whittier ) , between Ebner and Jaeger , in what is now Schumacher Place .
OSU lost the game , 64–0 .
Over the next eight years , under a number of coaches , the team played to a cumulative record of 31 wins , 39 losses , and 2 ties .
The first game against the University of Michigan , in Ann Arbor , was a 34–0 loss in 1897 , a year that saw the low point in Buckeye football history with a 1–7–1 record .
Jack Ryder was Ohio State 's first paid coach , earning $ 150 per season , and lost his first game , against Oberlin College and John Heisman , on October 15 , 1892 .
In 1899 the university hired John Eckstorm to bring professional coaching skills to the program and immediately went undefeated .
In 1901 , however , center John Segrist was fatally injured in a game against Western Reserve University and the continuation of football at Ohio State was in serious question .
Although the school 's athletic board let the team decide its future , Eckstorm resigned .
In 1912 football underwent a number of developments that included joining the Western Conference , making football as part of a new Department of Athletics , and hiring Lynn W. St. John to be athletic director .
Chic Harley attended East High in Columbus and was one of the greatest players to attend an Ohio high school .
He passed , ran , received , punted , kicked and played defense .
Harley came to Ohio State in 1916 and Columbus fans instantly fell in love with the Chic .
Harley and the Buckeyes won the very first Big Ten championship in school history in 1916 when the Buckeyes finished 7–0 .
He would repeat in 1917 finishing 8–0–1 , giving the Buckeyes a second outright title .
In 1918 , he left to be a pilot in the air force for World War I. With Harley 's return in 1919 , the Buckeyes would only lose one game — to Illinois .
Chic Harley left OSU with a career record of 22–1–1 .
At the time , OSU played at the small Ohio Field and Harley brought such record crowds it became necessary to open Ohio Stadium in 1922 .
The stadium was built entirely on fan donations and several stadium drives around the city where Harley would often appear .
In 1951 , when the College Football Hall of Fame opened , Harley was inducted as an inaugural member .
Ohio State 's very first rival was Kenyon College , a small liberal arts college in Gambier , roughly 50 miles to the northeast .
The Buckeyes first played them in their first season in 1890 on Nov 27 , Kenyon won the first two meetings ; however , Ohio State won 15 in a row and the rivalry diminished .
Kenyon made it their season goal to defeat OSU .
After the Bucks joined the Big Ten they stopped playing Kenyon .
The all - time record stands at 18–6 , OSU .
FRANCIS SCHMIDT ( 1934–1940 ) Section::::Francis Schmidt ( 1934–1940 ) .
In hiring Francis Schmidt in March 1934 to coach its football team , Ohio State moved its program to a " big - time " level of competition .
Schmidt was a well - established coach and an acknowledged offensive innovator .
His offensive schemes were a " wide - open " style called " razzle - dazzle " and led him to be the first Buckeye football coach granted a multi - year contract .
Schmidt 's first four seasons saw victories over archrival Michigan , all by shut - out .
The 1935 squad went 7–1 , its sole loss was to Notre Dame , 18–13 , in the first contest between the programs .
However Schmidt 's remaining seasons were less successful , except in 1939 when the Buckeyes won the Big Ten championship , and his popularity faded for a number of reasons .
On December 17 , 1940 , he resigned .
PAUL BROWN ( 1941–1943 ) Section::::Paul Brown ( 1941–1943 ) .
Ohio State hired the coach of Massillon Washington High School football team , Paul Brown , to succeed Schmidt .
Brown 's Tigers had just won their sixth straight state championship .
Brown immediately changed Ohio State 's style of offense , planned and organized his program in great detail , and delegated to his assistant coaches using highly structured practices .
In 1942 , Ohio State lost 22 veteran players to military service as the United States joined World War II , and with a team of mostly sophomores went on to lose only once in winning its first national championship .
CARROLL WIDDOES ( 1944–1945 ) ,
PAUL BIXLER ( 1946 ) AND WES FESLER ( 1947–1950 )
Section::::Carroll Widdoes ( 1944–1945 ) , Paul Bixler ( 1946 ) and Wes Fesler ( 1947–1950 ) .
Brown accepted a commission in the United States Navy in 1944 and directed his assistant Carroll Widdoes to head the team in his absence .
The 1944 team fielded 31 freshmen but went undefeated and untied , including a victory over Paul Brown 's Great Lakes Navy team .
Ohio State finished second in the national rankings behind Army and Les Horvath became the first Buckeye to be awarded the Heisman Trophy .
Also prominent on the 1942–44 teams was the first Buckeye African American star , Bill Willis .
Brown chose not to return to Ohio State after the war , going into professional football instead .
Widdoes , despite having the highest two - year winning percentage of any Buckeye coach , asked to return to an assistant 's position .
Offensive coordinator Paul Bixler and Widdoes switched positions , and Bixler endured a mediocre 4–3–2 season .
Bixler resigned and talk of Ohio State being a " graveyard of coaches " became commonplace , a reputation that lingered for decades .
Wes Fesler became head coach in 1947 but finished last in the Big Ten for the only time in team history .
Ohio State improved greatly in 1948 , winning 6 and losing 3 , then in 1949 enjoyed a successful season due to the play of sophomore Vic Janowicz .
Ohio State received the Rose Bowl invitation , where they came from behind to defeat California .
In 1950 Fesler , rumored to be resigning because of pressures associated with the position and abuse of his family by anonymous critics , returned to coach the Buckeyes , who won six games in a row to move into the top ranking in the AP poll .
However , the season fell apart as the Buckeyes lost to Michigan during a blizzard , a game that came to be known as the " Snow Bowl " .
Two weeks later , citing concerns about his health and family , Fesler resigned .
WOODY HAYES ERA ( 1951–1978 )
Section::::Woody Hayes era ( 1951–1978 ) .
Wayne Woodrow " Woody " Hayes beat out Paul Brown , among others , to be named head coach on February 18 , 1951 .
He instituted a demanding practice regimen and was both aggressive and vocal in enforcing it , alienating many players accustomed to Fesler 's laid - back style .
The 1951 Buckeyes won 4 , lost 3 , and tied 2 , leaving many to question the ability of the new coach .
In 1952 the team improved to 6–3 , and recorded their first victory over Michigan in eight years , but after a 1953 loss to Michigan , critics called for the replacement of Hayes .
In 1954 the Buckeyes were picked to finish no higher than 10th in the Big Ten .
Hayes , however , had the talents of
Howard " Hopalong " Cassady , and a historic goal - line stand against Michigan propelled Ohio State to a perfect season .
Hayes led the powerhouse Buckeyes to a shared national championship ( his first and the team 's second ) .
In 1955 the team again won the Big Ten , set an attendance record , and won in Ann Arbor for the first time in 18 years , while Hopalong Cassady was securing the Heisman Trophy .
Ohio State passed only three times against Michigan ( the sole reception was the only completion in the final three games of the year ) , leading to characterization of Hayes ' style of offensive play as " three yards and a cloud of dust " .
In a 1955 article in Sports Illustrated , Hayes admitted making small personal loans to financially needy players .
The article resulted in a furor over possible violations of NCAA rules , and the faculty council , followed by the Big Ten and NCAA , conducted lengthy investigations .
Big Ten Commissioner Kenneth " Tug " Wilson found Hayes and the program guilty of violations and placed it on a year 's probation in 1956 .
In 1957 Ohio State won all of its remaining games after an opening loss to claim the Big Ten championship , win the Rose Bowl over Oregon , and share a national title with Auburn , for which Hayes was named Coach of the Year .
In 1961 the team went undefeated to be named national champions by the FWAA but a growing conflict between academics and athletics over Ohio State 's reputation as a " football school " resulted in a faculty council vote to decline an invitation to the Rose Bowl , resulting in much public protest and debate .
Over the next 6 seasons Ohio State finished no higher than 2nd , and had a losing season in 1966 , and public speculation that Hayes would be replaced as coach grew to its highest point since 1953 .
In 1968 Ohio State defeated the number one - ranked Purdue Boilermakers and continued to an undefeated season including a 50–14 rout of Michigan and a Rose Bowl victory over the USC Trojans that resulted in the national championship .
The Class of 1970 became known as the " super sophomores " in 1968 , and might have gone on to three consecutive national championships except for what may have been the most bitter loss in Buckeye history .
The winning streak reached 22 games as Ohio State traveled to Michigan .
The Buckeyes were 17-point favorites but directed by first - year coach Bo Schembechler , Michigan shocked the Buckeyes in a 24–12 upset .
The 1969 loss to Michigan initiated what came to be known as " The Ten Year War " , in which the rivalry , which pitted some of OSU 's and UM 's strongest teams ever , rose to the uppermost level of all sports and the competition between Schembechler and Hayes became legendary .
Four times between 1970 and 1975 , Ohio State and Michigan were both ranked in the top five of the AP Poll before their matchup .
The Wolverines entered every game during those years undefeated and won only once , a 10–7 victory in Ann Arbor on November 20 , 1971 .
Both teams used the annual game as motivation for entire seasons and after the initial win by Michigan , played dead even at four wins and a tie apiece .
Hayes had the upper hand during the first part of the war , in which Ohio State won the conference championship and went to the Rose Bowl four straight years , while Michigan won the final three .
It was also an era in which through television Ohio State football again came to the forefront of national attention .
Hayes set the tone in spring practice in 1970 , placing a rug at the entrance to the Buckeye dressing room emblazoned with the words : " 1969 MICH 24 OSU 12 — 1970 MICH :
_ _ OSU :
_ _ " as a constant reminder of their objective .
The " super sophomores " , now seniors , used a strong fullback - oriented offense to smash their way through the season undefeated , struggling only with Purdue the week before the Michigan game .
The return match in Columbus found both teams undefeated and untied , a " first " in the history of the rivalry , with Michigan ranked fourth and Ohio State fifth .
Ohio State combined a powerful defense that held Michigan to only 37 yards rushing , a rushing offense employing two tight ends as blockers , and a 26-yard touchdown pass from Kern to Bruce Jankowski to win 20–9 .
The Buckeyes returned to the Rose Bowl to be upset by Stanford 27–17 .
The " super sophomores " had garnered a record of 27–2 , the best winning percentage of any three - year period in team history , and won or shared the Big Ten title all three years .
The National Football Foundation named Ohio State its national champion for 1970 .
1971 was less successful than the preceding seasons , but the middle four years of the 10-year war saw the greatest success for Hayes against Michigan , although the teams fell short of repeating their 1968 national championship .
Archie Griffin began his college football career in 1972 , taking advantage of new NCAA eligibility rules that allowed freshmen to compete at the varsity level .
In his second game , sent in against North Carolina late in the first quarter , Griffin set a new Buckeye rushing record with 239 yards and led the team in rushing for the season with 867 .
The following season Hayes installed an I - formation attack with Griffin at tailback and fellow sophomore Cornelius Greene at quarterback .
The Buckeyes went undefeated with a powerful offense and equally impenetrable defense , achieving an average margin of victory of 31 points a game .
The only blemish on their record was a 10–10 tie with Michigan after both teams had entered the game unbeaten .
( The tie was more galling for the Wolverines , however , as the Big Ten selected Ohio State to represent the conference in the Rose Bowl . )
Despite soundly defeating defending national champion USC , however , the tie with Michigan resulted in the Buckeyes finishing second to Notre Dame in the final AP rankings .
Griffin , Randy Gradishar , Van DeCree , and John Hicks were named All - Americans ; Hicks , an offensive tackle , not only won both the Outland and Lombardi Trophies , but placed second in the Heisman Trophy competition .
1974 and 1975 were seasons of both elation and frustration .
The Buckeyes twice more defeated Michigan and went to two Rose Bowls , but lost both .
The 1974 team seemed bound for another national championship when it was derailed by a loss to unranked Michigan State ( Ohio State lost only twice in the regular season during Griffin 's 4-year career , both to the Spartans ) , and the next year the # 1-ranked Bucks lost 23–10 to 11th - ranked UCLA in the 1976 Rose Bowl .
In all the Buckeyes were 40–5–1 from 1972–75 , winning the Big Ten all four years and never losing to Michigan , but each loss and the tie were crucial in failing to win another championship .
Archie Griffin , however , received the Heisman Trophy for both years , off - setting much of the frustration , and amassed 5,589 yards in his career .
The falloff in success of Hayes ' last three years was not great .
His teams forged records of 9–2–1 , 9–3 , and 7–4–1 , and made bowl appearances in all three years ( the rules had changed to allow appearances in other than the Rose Bowl ) .
However frustrations in losing three straight years to Michigan , and other factors , resulted in growing criticism of Hayes and his methods , particularly his on - the - field fits of temper .
Even so , his downfall was sudden and shocking when near the end of the nationally televised Gator Bowl , Hayes punched Clemson middle guard Charlie Bauman after Bauman intercepted a pass to kill Ohio State 's last chance to win .
Hayes was fired after the game by Ohio State president Harold Enarson and athletic director Hugh Hindman .
EARLE BRUCE ( 1979–1987 )
Section::::Earle Bruce ( 1979–1987 ) .
Hayes was replaced by a former protégé , Earle Bruce .
Bruce inherited a strong team led by sophomore quarterback Art Schlichter
but that had also lost eleven starters , and the 1979 squad exceeded pre - season expectations , ending the 3-year loss drought against Michigan and going to the Rose Bowl with an opportunity once again to be national champions .
The Buckeyes lost both by a single point , 17–16 , but Bruce was named Coach of the Year .
His success was hailed by those in the media who saw it as a rebuke of Hayes and the start of a " new era " .
1980 , however , saw the start of a trend that eventually brought criticism to Bruce , when Ohio State finished with a 9–3 record , the first of six consecutive years at 9–3 .
Though each of these seasons , and the 10–3 season that followed them , culminated in a bowl game , Ohio State did not appear to be any closer to a national championship than during the end of the Hayes era .
Bruce 's teams were not without impact players , however .
All - Americans and future National Football League stars included Keith Byars , Cris Carter , Chris Spielman , John Frank , Jim Lachey , Tom Tupa , Marcus Marek , and Pepper Johnson .
His program was also known for the number of notable assistant coaches on staff , including Jim Tressel , Glen Mason , Pete Carroll , Nick Saban , Urban Meyer and Dom Capers .
The 1980 team was selected as the top - ranked team of the pre - season AP poll and opened the season with four games at home , but were shocked in the fourth game by UCLA , shut out 17–0 .
The team rebounded to win its next six easily , but then were shut down by a ball - control Michigan team that allowed the Buckeyes only 23 minutes with the ball , then lost again to Penn State in the Fiesta Bowl .
In 1981 , Ohio State opened strong , including a victory at Stanford in which senior Art Schlichter out - dueled John Elway , but then lost back - to - back games to Florida State and Wisconsin ( their first victory over the Buckeyes in 22 games ) .
The Buckeyes continued to struggle on defense , losing a third time , at Minnesota .
Victories over Michigan to gain a share of the Big Ten championship and over Navy in the Liberty Bowl salvaged the season .
For the first time since 1922 the Buckeyes lost three in a row in Ohio Stadium in 1982 , including rematches with Stanford and Florida State , and for the second year in a row to Wisconsin , but then won seven straight , the last over BYU in the Holiday Bowl .
Sophomore running back Keith Byars had a stand - out season in 1983 , rushing for 1,199 yards , and Ohio State defeated the Oklahoma Sooners in Norman , but three losses in conference meant a 4th - place finish .
1984 witnessed what Bruce called " the greatest comeback after the worst start " when Ohio State fell behind Illinois 24–0 at home but roared back on 274 yards rushing and five touchdowns by Byars to win 45–38 .
Ohio State also defeated Michigan to win an outright Big Ten championship .
Byars led the nation in rushing and scoring but finished second in Heisman balloting .
Byars broke his toe just prior to the start of the 1985 season , ending his Heisman hopes and seriously handicapping the Buckeye attack .
He returned against Purdue with Ohio State at 4–1 and scored twice , but then re - injured his foot the next week against Minnesota .
Iowa was top - ranked nationally when they came into Ohio Stadium favored to end the longest home winning streak in the country , and were the first # 1 team the Buckeyes faced since Purdue in 1968 .
Ohio State 's defense dominated with four interceptions to win 22–13 .
In 1986 Bruce received a 3-year contract , the first for the modern program but the team opened with two losses , which had not occurred in over 90 years .
The Buckeyes then won 9 in a row before Michigan took a close game when kicker Matt Frantz missed a field goal with a minute to play .
After the season Bruce was offered the position of head coach at the University of Arizona with a 5-year contract but was persuaded to stay at his alma mater by Athletic Director Rick Bay .
Hopes for a standout season in 1987 suffered a serious setback when All - American wide receiver Cris Carter was dropped from the team for signing with an agent .
Indiana defeated Ohio State for the first time since 1951 , 31–10 , in a game that came to be known as the " darkest day " , and Ohio State lost three conference games in a row going into the Michigan game .
On the Monday of Michigan week , after a weekend of rumors and speculation , Ohio State President Edward Jennings fired Bruce but tried to keep the dismissal secret until after the end of the season .
Bay , who had been instrumental in keeping Bruce at Ohio State , disregarded Jennings ' orders and announced the firing and his own resignation in protest .
Jennings made his own situation worse by refusing to give a reason for the firing and the circumstances have been the subject of controversy since .
The Buckeyes enjoyed an emotional come - from - behind victory over Michigan in Ann Arbor after the entire team wore headbands bearing the word " EARLE " , then declined an invitation to play in the Sun Bowl .
JOHN COOPER ( 1988–2000 ) Section::::John Cooper ( 1988–2000 ) .
John Cooper was hired as the 21st football head coach at Ohio State before the end of 1987 and before he had coached his last game at Arizona State University .
Cooper 's coaching record at ASU and at Tulsa prior to that stood out among his credentials , as did a victory over Michigan in the 1987 Rose Bowl .
Cooper 's thirteen years as Buckeye head coach are largely remembered in the litany of negative statistics associated with him : a notorious 2–10–1 record against Michigan , a 3–8 record in bowl games , a 5-year losing streak to Illinois to start his term and a 6–7 record overall , and blowing a 15-point 3rd quarter lead in a 28–24 loss to unranked Michigan State when the Buckeyes were the top - ranked team in the nation and en route to a national championship .
However his record also has many positives : back - to - back victories over Notre Dame , two finishes second - ranked in the polls , and three Big Ten championships ( albeit shared ) .
Cooper also recruited 15 players who were first - round draft picks in the National Football League .
Both 1988 and 1989 began identically : an impressive season - opening win followed by an embarrassing loss to a highly regarded team ( Pitt and USC ) ; a rebound win against two other highly regarded programs ( LSU and Boston College ) followed by a loss to Illinois in the conference opener .
However 1988 saw Ohio State lose its first three conference games and a close game at home against Michigan for a 4–6–1 record , its first losing season in 22 years .
In 1989 the Buckeyes won 6 consecutive Big Ten games before losing its last two to go 8–4 .
The most noteworthy victory occurred in Minneapolis when Ohio State overcame a 31–0 deficit to Minnesota to win 41–37 .
1990 continued the pattern with a 2-win 2-loss start and an overall 7–4–1 record that included an embarrassing loss to Air Force in the Liberty Bowl .
1991 was 8–4 , notable primarily as the season that sophomore running back Robert Smith quit the team .
1992 , with senior Kirk Herbstreit at quarterback , and Smith back on the team was 8–3–1 , but the losing string to Michigan was broken with a 13–13 tie .
Persistent rumors that Cooper would resign or be fired were laid to rest when University President Gordon Gee announced he would be back in 1993 .
The next 6 seasons were very successful , winning ten or more games in 5 of the 6 and sharing the conference championship in three .
Eddie George won the Heisman Trophy in 1995 after a tremendous senior season , Ohio State defeated Notre Dame in 1995 and 1996 , and won half its bowl games .
But in three seasons ( 1993 , 1995 , and 1996 )
the Buckeyes entered the Michigan game undefeated , with the possibility of a national championship in at least one , and lost all three to underdog Wolverine teams .
Ohio State had won 62 games and lost only 12 , but a third of those were to Michigan .
After renewing his contract and becoming a member of the " million dollar coaching club " , Cooper started sophomore Austin Moherman against the Miami Hurricanes in the nationally televised Kickoff Classic and was soundly beaten .
That presaged a mediocre season in which the Buckeyes finished 6–6 , ending their successful 90 's run .
The 2000 team was more successful , going 8–4 , but criticism of Cooper among fans had risen to a clamor again and touched on many areas of the program beyond specific game records .
The negative publicity rose to a peak in the days leading up to Ohio State 's matchup with South Carolina in the Outback Bowl , when wide receiver Reggie Germany was suspended for having a 0.0 GPA , team captain Matt Wilhelm publicly criticized fellow player Ken - Yon Rambo , and one Buckeye lineman sued another .
In January 2001 , Cooper was fired .
His loss in the Outback Bowl to a team that had not even won a single game the year before was a factor in his subsequent firing , as was negative publicity regarding player behavior before and during the game .
Other contributing factors included the record against Michigan ( which was actually considered by most people to be the biggest reason for his firing ) , a reputation of inability to win " big games " , the lack of a national championship , the perception of him as an outsider by many alumni , the poor bowl game record , and finally a perceived lack of discipline on the team .
JIM TRESSEL ( 2001–2010 ) Section::::Jim Tressel ( 2001–2010 ) .
Ohio State quickly sought a replacement for Cooper and after a nationwide search hired Jim Tressel .
With four NCAA Division I - AA National Championships at Youngstown State University , Tressel , formerly an assistant coach for Earle Bruce , was an Ohioan who was considered to be appreciative of Buckeye football traditions .
Although there were some doubts as to whether or not Tressel could repeat his earlier success at the Division 1A level , most fans and alumni met the coaching change with enthusiasm .
On the day of his hiring , Jim Tressel , speaking to fans and students at a Buckeye basketball game , made a prophetic implication that he would lead the Buckeyes to beat Michigan in Ann Arbor the following November .
Tressel 's first season was difficult as the Buckeyes finished 7–5 ( all but one loss was by a touchdown or less ) , but he made good on his promise , beating Michigan in Ann Arbor .
While its fans were optimistic about the chance for success of the 2002 team , most observers were surprised by Ohio State 's National Championship .
Ohio State used strong defense , ball - control play - calling , and field position tactics to win numerous close games , a style of play characterized as " Tresselball " , and disparaged by detractors as " the Luckeyes " .
The 2006 and 2007 regular seasons ended with just one combined loss and consecutive appearances in the national championship game .
The Buckeyes lost both by wide margins .
On January 1 , 2010 , the Buckeyes defeated the Oregon Ducks in The Rose Bowl Game by a score of 26–17 .
This ended a 3-game BCS losing streak for Ohio State , having lost 2 national championships and one Tostitos Fiesta Bowl .
Terrelle Pryor was named MVP of the contest with 2 touchdown passes for a career - high 266 passing yards .
In addition , he had more total yards than the entire Oregon Ducks team .
In December 2010 it was announced that five student - athletes on the football team would be suspended for the first five games of the 2011 season for NCAA violations .
The punishments stemmed from an incident when some of the Buckeye players received tattoos for their autographs , according to news reports .
Other violations committed by the players included the selling of several items given to them by the University , such as Big Ten championship rings .
On January 4 , 2011 , Ohio State completed its season with a 31–26 win over Arkansas in the Sugar Bowl .
The Sugar Bowl win would have marked Ohio State 's first bowl victory over a Southeastern Conference opponent in ten attempts , but the win was later vacated due to NCAA violations .
Ohio State ended up with an 0–1 record ( the lone loss from the Wisconsin Badgers ) for the 2010 season after vacating its wins for NCAA violations .
" TATTOOGATE " Section::::"Tattoogate " .
On December 22 , 2010 , the NCAA announced that five players would be suspended for the first five games of the 2011 season due to receiving improper benefits .
Mike Adams , Dan Herron , DeVier Posey , Solomon Thomas , and quarterback Terrelle Pryor were found to have signed autographs in return for tattoos , as well as selling memorabilia given to them by the university .
In addition , Jordan Whiting was suspended for the season opener for his involvement .
The scandal originated at Fine Line Tattoos and Piercings in Columbus whose owner , Edward Rife , was being investigated for felony drug trafficking .
On January 4 , 2011 , with all the players allowed to participate by the NCAA , the Buckeyes defeated the Arkansas Razorbacks in the Sugar Bowl by a margin of 31–26 .
The win along with every other one from the 2010 season would later be vacated due to the scandal .
The Buckeyes finished the season 0–1 , with their only official game being a loss to Wisconsin .
On March 8 , 2011 , OSU suspended head coach Jim Tressel for the first 2 games of the 2011 season and fined him $ 250,000 for not informing the university and the NCAA that he had knowledge of his players receiving improper benefits .
Coach Tressel 's suspension would later be increased to 5 games by the university .
On May 30 , 2011 Jim Tressel resigned as head coach of the Buckeyes .
On June 6 , 2011 , a story in Sports Illustrated reported that at least 28 players , including Rob Rose , T. J. Downing , Louis Irizarry , Chris Vance , C. J. Barnett , Dorien Bell , Jamaal Berry , Bo DeLande , Zach Domicone , Storm Klein , Etienne Sabino , John Simon , Nathan Williams , Jermale Hines , Devon Torrence , Donald Washington , Thaddeus Gibson , Jermil Martin , Lamaar Thomas , and Doug Worthington traded team memorabilia or used equipment for tattoos or other merchandise or services between 2002 and 2010 .
The report alleged that Tressel had violated NCAA bylaw 10.1 – unethical conduct , three times by not acting when told of the tattoo improprieties , by signing a statement saying he knew of no violations , and for withholding information on what was going on from university officials .
LUKE FICKELL ( 2011 )
Section::::Luke Fickell ( 2011 ) .
On July 8 , 2011 , Ohio State University decided to vacate all victories from the 2010 football season as self - imposed punishment for major NCAA violations .
Former coach Jim Tressel received more than $ 52,000 from the university and wo n't have to pay a $ 250,000 fine for his involvement in the scandal .
His status is also changed from ' Resigned ' to " Retired " in keeping with his wishes to " remain a Buckeye for life . "
Ohio State named Luke Fickell interim head coach for the 2011 season following Tressel 's resignation , and Fickell coached the 2011 Buckeyes to a 6–7 record ; going 6–6 in the regular season and losing in the Gator Bowl to Florida .
URBAN MEYER ( 2012–PRESENT )
Section::::Urban Meyer ( 2012–present ) .
On November 28 , 2011 , former University of Florida head coach and ESPN college football analyst Urban Meyer accepted the position of Buckeyes head coach .
Meyer assumed head coaching responsibilities following the Buckeyes ' January 2012 Gator Bowl appearance .
Meyer 's first season at Ohio State did not include a postseason contest , as the Buckeyes were sanctioned with a one - year bowl ban on December 20 , 2011 .
The NCAA sanctions also included the loss of three scholarships each year for the following three years and three years ' probation to end on December 19 , 2014 .
Ohio State was required to vacate all wins from the 2010 season , the 2010 Big Ten Conference championship and their win in the 2011 Sugar Bowl .
The school 's share of the Sugar Bowl proceeds were forfeited as well .
In Meyer 's first year , the Buckeyes went a perfect 12–0 , winning the 2012 Big Ten Leaders Division , though the previously mentioned sanctions kept them from playing in the 2012 Big Ten Football Championship Game and a postseason bowl game .
The Buckeyes played their 2013 Spring game at Paul Brown Stadium in Cincinnati , home of the Bengals on April 13 , 2013 .
The Scarlet won 31–14 .
On November 23 , 2013 , the Buckeyes clinched their second straight Leaders Division Championship , after defeating Indiana 42–14 .
With the victory over Indiana , Ohio State set a team record for all - time consecutive wins , with 23 .
The following week , Ohio State defeated Michigan 42–41 in Ann Arbor , to increase the streak to 24 .
The streak ended with Ohio State 's 34–24 loss to Michigan State in the 2013 Big 10 Conference Championship game on December 7 , marking Meyer 's first loss as the Buckeyes ' head coach .
On January 3 , 2014 , the Buckeyes were defeated by Clemson in the Orange Bowl 40–35 .
On November 22 , 2014 , the Buckeyes clinched the first ever Big Ten East Division Championship when they defeated Indiana 42–27 , earning a berth in the 2014 Big Ten Championship Game , where they defeated West Division champion Wisconsin 59–0 to win the Big Ten Conference Championship and qualified for the four - team playoff to decide the National Champion .
OSU defeated Alabama in the Sugar Bowl 42–35 , on January 1 , 2015 , to qualify for the National Championship Game against Rose Bowl winner Oregon on January 12 ( the Rose and Sugar Bowls were the designated semifinal games in 2014 ) .
OSU claimed the first ever College Football Playoff National Championship by defeating Oregon 42–20 .
The 2015 season for the Buckeyes began with a 10–0 start before losing on a last second field goal to Michigan State on November 21 , ending the Buckeyes quest to repeat as National Champions .
However , the Buckeyes recovered their 2 next games with dominating wins over Michigan and then over Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl to finish the season at 12–1 .
The 2016 season started off great with 6 straight victories , including a win over the Oklahoma Sooners .
That win streak came to an end as the team lost a heart - breaker to the Penn State Nittany Lions .
The Buckeyes would win the rest of their regular season games going 11 - 1 .
They would not play in the Big Ten Championship as Penn State took the division .
In a controversial call , the College Football Playoff committee would give Ohio State a spot in the Playoff .
Ohio State would then lose in the Fiesta Bowl to the Clemson Tigers in an embarrassing 31 - 0 loss , ending the season 11 - 2 .
The 2017 season started out on a high note with a victory over the Indiana Hoosiers , but the Buckeyes would then fall short to the Oklahoma Sooners the next week .
The Buckeyes would win the next 6 games of the season , including a win over a Penn State team that was ranked number 2 in the nation in a revenge game of sorts .
However , the Buckeyes suffered an embarrassing defeat against the Iowa Hawkeyes .
The Buckeyes would end the season 12 - 2 overall , winning out the rest of their games including a Big Ten Championship victory over Wisconsin and a Cotton Bowl victory over USC .
Urban Meyer was suspended for the first three games of the 2018 season for mishandling domestic violence allegations against then - wide receivers coach Zach Smith .
Co - Offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Ryan Day served as interim coach and led the Buckeyes to a 3 - 0 start .
Meyer returned to the sidelines and coached the team to two more victories before the team suffered a loss on October 20th to Purdue , 49 - 20 .
The Buckeyes won their last four games of the regular season , including a 62 - 39 win over archival Michigan , in Columbus .
The win gave the Buckeyes a share of the Big Ten East Division title , and the right to face Northwestern in the Big Ten Championship Game , which Ohio State won for its second consecutive Big Ten Championship .
On December 4 , 2018 , the university announced that Meyer would retire after the 2019 Rose Bowl and be replaced by co - offensive coordinator Ryan Day .

VENUES
* Recreation Park ( Columbus ) ( 1890–97 ) * Ohio Field ( 1898–1921 ) * Ohio Stadium ( 1922–present ) TRADITIONS Section::::Traditions .
Ohio State football is rich in traditions .
The following are football traditions in chronological order of longevity :
*
Senior tackle Begun in 1913 by head coach John Wilce , seniors on the team are recognized at the last practice of the season , either before the Michigan game or before departing Columbus to play in a bowl game , and hit the blocking sled a final time .
* Illibuck
The winner of the Ohio State - Illinois game has been awarded the Illibuck Trophy since 1925 .
Until 1927 the teams played for a live turtle , however , since the 1928 season the trophy is a carved wooden likeness of a turtle .
* Gold pants A gold miniature charm depicting a pair of football pants is given to all players and coaches following a victory over the Michigan Wolverines .
The tradition began as the result of a comment to reporters by newly hired head coach Francis Schmidt on March 2 , 1934 : " How about Michigan ?
They put their pants on one leg at a time , the same as we do ! "
The first gold pants , which were a creation of Simon Lazarus ( president of the Lazarus chain of department stores ) and Herbert Levy , were awarded that year for a 34–0 defeat of the Wolverines .
* Captain 's Breakfast 1934 also saw the first gathering of former team captains for breakfast on the Sunday following the Homecoming game .
The event began when local businessman Walter Jeffrey invited twenty former captains to the Scioto Country Club to honor them , and continues to welcome new captains and award them mugs bearing their names and season .
* Buckeye Grove Begun in 1934 , each player who wins " first - team All - America " honors is recognized by the planting of a buckeye tree and installation of a plaque in Buckeye Grove , now located near the southwestern corner of Ohio Stadium next to Morrill Tower .
Trees are planted in ceremonies held prior to the Spring Game .
All 126 Buckeye All - Americans dating back to 1914 have been so honored .
* Michigan Week
Since 1935 the annual game against Michigan ( known as " that team up north " for Ohio State fans ) has been the final meeting of the regular season for both teams .
The week prior to " The Game " , known as Michigan Week , is characterized by scheduled school spirit and public service events , such as rallies , touch football games , and blood drives ; and by massive displays of school colors and banners in much of Ohio .
In an unofficial culmination to Michigan Week , since 1990 on the Thursday night before " The Game " students have participated in the " Mirror Lake jump " , an unofficial gathering at Mirror Lake , a pond between Pomerene Hall and The Oval , in which masses of students jump into the water .
* Block O
Since 1938 the registered student organization Block O has been the " Official Cheering Section " of the Buckeyes .
"
Known for spreading spirit , starting cheers and performing card stunts , Block ' O ' was founded ... by Clancy Isaac .
" They occupy Section 39A in the South grandstand of Ohio Stadium , next to the band .
* Victory Bell
The Victory Bell is rung after every Ohio State victory by members of Alpha Phi Omega , a tradition that began after the Bucks beat California October 2 , 1954 .
Reputedly the ringing can be heard five miles away " on a calm day . "
Located 150 feet high in the southeast tower of Ohio Stadium , the bell was a gift of the classes of 1943 , 1944 and 1945 , and weighs 2,420 pounds .
The bell is rung for 15 minutes following a victory and for 30 minutes following a victory over Michigan .
* Brutus Buckeye
Beginning in 1965 , Brutus Buckeye has appeared at all Ohio State football games as the live mascot of the Buckeyes .
In 2007 he was inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame and is now one of the most recognized mascots in the United States .
* Hang on Sloopy First played at the Illinois game of October 9 , 1965 , the rock song Hang on Sloopy is now played by the marching band before the start of the fourth quarter , with fans performing an O - H - I - O chant in the intervals between the refrains .
The song is also played to encourage the team 's defensive players when opponents are moving the ball on offense late in a game .
The 116th Ohio General Assembly designated " Hang On Sloopy " as the State rock song by House Concurrent Resolution 16 on November 20 , 1985 .
It is also played before the fourth quarter at Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals games , as well as during Cleveland Indians , Cincinnati Reds , Cleveland Cavaliers , and Columbus Blue Jackets games .
* Buckeye Leaves Since 1967 , the helmets of Ohio State players have been adorned with white decals approximately the size of a quarter depicting a buckeye leaf , awarded for making significant plays and for consistency of performance .
In the 1970s , the decals were approximately the size of a Silver Dollar until the 1979 Season .
Most believe that this practice began in 1968 when the Buckeyes switched to their present Silver Helmet design since the decals have become identified with that helmet .
* Mirror Lake Since 1990 as part of Michigan Week , OSU students typically jump into Mirror Lake – located on campus – the Thursday night before the game .
The tradition is thought to bring good luck to the football team for the game .
Since the 2010 season , the Thursday before " The Game " has been Thanksgiving .
With most of the student body leaving campus for the holiday , the jump has since occurred on the Tuesday of Michigan Week .
* Tunnel of Pride
The Tunnel of Pride began with the 1994 Michigan game when all former players who were in attendance formed a tunnel through which the team ran to take the field , and Ohio State beat its rival that day , 22–6 .
Rex Kern , quarterback of the 1968 National Championship team , and then Director of Athletics Andy Geiger together used the concept as a means of connecting current Buckeyes with those who played before them .
The Tunnel of Pride was next formed for the 1995 Notre Dame game , which the Buckeyes also won .
In each home game against Michigan since , the tradition has been repeated .
* Carmen Ohio Instituted by Coach Tressel in 2001 , at the conclusion of all home games the coaches , players and cheerleaders gather in the south end zone next to the marching band to sing the university 's alma mater , Carmen Ohio , to the student section .
* The Hive and pre - game circle Tressel brought to the Buckeye football program two pre - game traditions he developed at Youngstown State .
Prior to its warmup routine before every football game , the team exits the locker room as a unit in a controlled manner , linked arm - in - arm in a group known as " The Hive " .
After warmups the team returns to the locker room , and when it next appears , runs onto the field and forms a circle of players around the strength coach , then they go through their warmup routine .
MARCHING BAND Section::::Marching band .
The Marching Band , often referred to as " The Best Damn Band In The Land " or by the acronym TBDBITL is the most visible and possibly best - known tradition of Ohio State football .
Home games are preceded by three much - anticipated traditions , and a fourth , " dotting the ' i ' " of Script Ohio , enjoys a reputation all its own : * Skull Session * Ramp entrance
*
The Back Bend * Script Ohio RIVALRIES Section::::Rivalries .
While its rivalry with the University of Michigan is its most renowned and intense , Ohio State has two other series marked by their longevity , both Big Ten Conference rivals , those of Indiana and Illinois .
The series versus Indiana began as a non - conference matchup , with Indiana going undefeated at 4–0–1 .
In conference , however , the Buckeyes ( despite losing the opening conference game ) are 70–8–4 through the 2014 season , the most wins against any opponent .
Illinois also began with non - conference games ( 0–1–1 ) but became the longest continuous series in 2002 when the schools played in their 89th consecutive year ( that record was tied by Michigan in 2007 ) .
Through 2014 Ohio State 's record against the Illini is 66–30–4 .
In 2007 , Ohio State was given their only defeat of the regular season by the Illini .
When Penn State was added to the conference football play in 1993 , every member was given two designated rivals , teams to be played every year , with the other conference teams rotated out of the schedule at regular intervals .
For geographic convenience , the Big Ten named Penn State as Ohio State 's new designated rival in addition to Michigan , and Illinois was set to be paired with in - state rival Northwestern and neighboring Indiana , and in doing so undermined Ohio State 's historical rivalry with Illinois .
With Nebraska 's entry to the Big Ten and the establishment of division play in football , Ohio State and Illinois played every season in the Leaders Division from 2011 to 2013 .
Michigan was the Buckeyes ' permanent cross - division rival from the Legends Division .
With the addition of Maryland and Rutgers to the Big Ten , Ohio State and Illinois will be in separate divisions and will no longer meet every year .
Ohio State and Michigan also became East Division rivals .
COACHES Section::::Coaches .
The Buckeyes have had 24 head coaches in their 121-year history .
Of the team 's eight national championships to date , Woody Hayes won five .
Paul Brown , Jim Tressel , and Urban Meyer also each have one .
