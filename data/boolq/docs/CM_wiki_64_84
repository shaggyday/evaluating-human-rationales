PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH
TURNPIKE
The President George Bush Turnpike ( PGBT ) is a toll road running through the northern , northeastern and western suburbs , forming a partial loop around Dallas , Texas , United States .
It is named for George H. W. Bush , the 41st President of the United States .
At its west end near Belt Line Road in Irving , State Highway 161 ( SH 161 ) continues southwest to Interstate 20 ( I-20 ) in Grand Prairie .
The discontinuous free frontage roads along the turnpike from I-35E in Carrollton east to its end at I-30 in Garland are assigned the State Highway 190 ( SH 190 ) designation .
SH 190 signage appears only along the Garland , Richardson , Plano , and Carrollton sections of the frontage road with the undersign " frontage road only " .
At intersections with city streets , only the Bush Turnpike signs are displayed , not the SH 190 signage .
Prior to the construction of the main lanes as a tollway , SH 190 was used as the name of the planned main lanes too .
Similarly , the part west of I-35E was planned as part of SH 161 .
Bush Turnpike is signed as a north – south road from I-20 to I-35E ( the " Western Extension " ) , an east – west road from I-35E to the Merritt Main Lane Gantry ( the original sections ) and as a north – south road from the Merritt Main Lane Gantry to
I-30 ( the " Eastern Extension " ) , as Bush Turnpike makes a nearly 90-degree curve in both places .
The turnpike is operated by the North Texas Tollway Authority ( NTTA ) .
Currently , all maintenance is done under a five - year total routine maintenance ( TRM ) contract with Roy Jorgensen Associates , Inc. based in Buckeystown , Maryland , that started in November 2011 .
The turnpike passes through three Texas counties ( Dallas , Collin and Denton ) and nine Dallas suburbs ( Rowlett , Sachse , Garland , Richardson , Plano , Carrollton , Farmers Branch , Irving and Grand Prairie ) .
Originally the PGBT was equipped with traditional toll plazas for cash payment as well as RFID - based TollTag express lanes .
However , on July 1 , 2009 the cash plazas were closed and replaced with " ZipCash " , an OCR - based camera system which reads the license plate and bills the owner by mail .
This made the turnpike the first in the United States to transition to all - electronic toll collection .
The ZipCash rates , however , come at a premium being significantly higher than both the TollTag rate and the earlier cash prices .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The corridor of SH 161 and the Turnpike was first proposed as an outer loop within Dallas County in 1957 .
The 1964 plan was the first to designate it as a freeway , and in 1969 the full loop was added to the state highway system as Loop 9 .
The loop would begin at Interstate 20 just east of the Tarrant County line and head north ( along a corridor still planned as an extension of SH 161 ) .
From State Highway 183 it would run roughly along present SH 161 , turning north on Belt Line Road and east just south of the Denton County line , crossing Interstate 35E near the present junction .
Rather than cross into Denton and Tarrant Counties , the loop would stay in Dallas County , running roughly where Campbell Road is now .
It would rejoin the present Turnpike alignment and head southeast to Interstate 30 west of Lake Ray Hubbard .
The south part of the loop would continue in a roughly circular route to end at the junction of Interstate 20 and Spur 408 , several miles east of the beginning of the loop .
The short Spur 484 , designated in 1970 , would run from Loop 9 at Belt Line Road northeast along the present Turnpike alignment to Interstate 635 .
Some of the opposition to the loop came from the city of Richardson , which was already divided by the Central Expressway .
In conjunction with Plano , the city acquired empty right - of - way about two miles ( 3 km ) to the north , where the Turnpike now runs , and set the centerline of the right - of - way to the border between Richardson and Plano .
Loop 9 was cancelled on October 1 , 1977 , and
the western and northern section was split between two new designations : State Highway 161 from Interstate 20 to State Highway 114 ( at Belt Line Road ) and State Highway 190 from Interstate 35E to State Highway 78 .
( The piece between SH 114 and IH 35E was removed from the state highway system . )
Spur 484 was absorbed into SH 161 on October 31 , 1979 , making
its northern terminus Interstate 635 ( at Valley View Lane ) .
The connection between I-635 and I-35E was added to SH 161 on August 30 , 1988 .
Construction on service roads began in late 1988 in north Garland and Richardson .
A stack interchange was constructed in 1990 at U.S. Highway 75 in Richardson , which quickly became a white elephant as the structure remained abandoned for several years .
On January 29 , 1991 , SH 190 was extended to I-20 .
In 1995 following a revision in federal laws , authorities agreed to shift to a toll financing scheme , providing an infusion of cash and new construction .
The SH 190 designation was removed from the plans for the not - yet - constructed main lanes on October 26 , 1995 , and SH 190 was truncated to SH 78 .
and on April 30 , 1998 SH 161 was removed from the piece between Belt Line Road and I-635 ( Segment V ) .
On April 26 , 2007 , SH 190 extended to I-30 . SH 161 was also the name of a route designated on March 19 , 1930 from Clairemont southeastward to SH 70 near Rotan as a renumbering of SH 84A.
That route was transferred to SH 70 on December 1 , 1930 , but was not cancelled until January 22 , 1931 .
SH 190 was also the name of a route designated on November 30 , 1932 from Cuero southwestward to SH 119 .
That route was transferred to SH 29 on March 19 , 1934 .
At Dallas North Tollway , the interchange had been built in 1994 ready for the turnpike to be built in 1998 .
DESCRIPTION Section::::Description .
Since the initial construction began in 1988 , the turnpike was completed in a number of phases , as described here :
Segment
I ( North Dallas ) .
Extends from Campbell Road to Midway Road , and includes the Dallas North Tollway and U.S. Highway 75
( Central Expressway ) interchanges .
Opened in December 1998 ( Midway Road to Preston Road ) and December 1999 ( Preston Road to Campbell Road ) .
Segment II ( Garland / Richardson ) .
Extends from Campbell Road to State Highway 78 .
Opened in 2000 .
Segment III ( Carrollton ) .
Extends from Midway Road in north Dallas to Interstate 35E. Opened July 2001 .
Segment IV ( " PGBT Superconnector " ) .
Connects I-35E to the I-635 airport extension .
It covers and was built at the cost of $ 339 million .
Much of the expense is because the segment is built within the Trinity River wetland and comprises many miles of bridges .
Construction began in January 2003 and was completed in October 2005 .
Segment V ( Irving ) .
A segment connecting the I-635 airport extension to the SH 161 freeway near Belt Line Road .
It opened in December 2001 .
Unstable clay soil was a significant problem in this segment , requiring contractors to use concentrated liquid stabilizers and geosynthetic reinforcement .
A part of President George Bush Turnpike was extended from SH 183 to Conflans Road in 2006 .
Segment VI ( " Western Extension " , Irving / Grand Prairie ) .
A extension south from SH-183 in Irving to I-30 in Grand Prairie .
A portion of the Western Extension , from SH-183 to I-30 in Grand Prairie , opened in August 2009 .
The remaining of the Western Extension , from I-30 to I-20 in Grand Prairie , opened in October 2012 .
Segment VII ( " Eastern Extension " , Garland / Sachse / Rowlett ) .
A extension from SH-78 in Garland , through Rowlett and Sachse , and back into Garland at I-30 .
The project , with a price tag of $ 1.04 billion , included construction of a 1-mile bridge at Lake Ray Hubbard .
Construction began in October 2008 , and the Eastern Extension opened to traffic on December 21 , 2011 .
Segment VIII ( " East Branch " , Garland / Mesquite ) .
A proposed extension from I-30 in Garland to I-20 in Mesquite , with an estimated cost of $ 730 million .
In December 2015 an Environmental Impact Statement for the East Branch had been prepared but the review process was restarted in 2017 .
Construction is not expected until 2026 .
EXPANSION PLANS Section::::Expansion plans .
The next PGBT segment , the East Branch extension , is planned to begin at the PGBT Lake Ray Hubbard Interchange at I-30 , extending south - southeast to near Duck Creek Way , then southward near Mesquite Metro Airport , terminating at I-20 near Rory Galloway Day Camp .
The project is well into the planning stages , and an Environmental Impact Statement was under preparation .
In May 2017 at a Dallas city council meeting it was stated TxDOT had restarted the environmental impact statement review process .
Construction is not expected until 2026 .
In the longer term , the North Central Texas Council of Governments is studying a very broad outer loop around the entire Dallas - Fort Worth metroplex .
Assuming it receives environmental clearance , funding , and political support , much of it would be completed in the 2020s or 2030s .
The PGBT is not part of this outer loop , but the PGBT East Branch alignment was closely coordinated with the loop 's master plan .
The segment of the proposed outer loop through southern Dallas County would be known as Loop 9 and would likely be the first segment to be built .
