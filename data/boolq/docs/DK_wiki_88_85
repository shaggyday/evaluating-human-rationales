GALACTIC YEAR
The galactic year , also known as a cosmic year , is the duration of time required for the Sun to orbit once around the center of the Milky Way Galaxy .
Estimates of the length of one orbit range from 225 to 250 million terrestrial years .
The Solar System is traveling at an average speed of 828,000 km / h ( 230 km / s ) or 514,000 mph ( 143 mi / s ) within its trajectory around the galactic center , a speed at which an object could circumnavigate the Earth 's equator in 2 minutes and 54 seconds ; that speed corresponds to approximately 1/1300 of the speed of light .
The galactic year provides a conveniently usable unit for depicting cosmic and geological time periods together .
By contrast , a " billion - year " scale does not allow for useful discrimination between geologic events , and a " million - year " scale requires some rather large numbers .
