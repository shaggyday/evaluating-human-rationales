AGE OF MAJORITY
The age of majority is the threshold of adulthood as recognized or declared in law .
It is the moment when minors cease to be considered such and assume legal control over their persons , actions , and decisions , thus terminating the control and legal responsibilities of their parents or guardian over them .
Most countries set the age of majority at 18 .
The word majority here refers to having greater years and being of full age as opposed to minority , the state of being a minor .
The law in a given jurisdiction may not actually use the term " age of majority " .
The term typically refers to a collection of laws bestowing the status of adulthood .
The age of majority does not necessarily correspond to the mental or physical maturity of an individual .
Age of majority should not be confused with the age of maturity , age of sexual consent , marriageable age , school - leaving age , drinking age , driving age , voting age , smoking age , gambling age , etc . , which each may be independent of and set at a different age from the age of majority .
Although a person may attain the age of majority in a particular jurisdiction , they may still be subject to age - based restrictions regarding matters such as the right to vote or stand for elective office , act as a judge , and many others .
EXPLANATION
Section::::Explanation .
Age of majority can be confused with the similar concept of the age of license , which also pertains to the threshold of adulthood but in a much broader and more abstract way .
As a legal term of art , " license " means " permission " , and it can implicate a legally enforceable right or privilege .
Thus , an age of license is an age at which one has legal permission from government to do something .
The age of majority , on the other hand , is legal recognition that one has grown into an adult .
Age of majority pertains solely to the acquisition of the legal control over one 's person , decisions and actions , and the correlative termination of the legal authority of the parents ( or guardian(s ) , in lieu of parent(s ) ) over the child 's person and affairs generally .
Many ages of license are correlated to the age of majority , but they are nonetheless legally distinct concepts .
One need not have attained the age of majority to have permission to exercise certain rights and responsibilities .
Some ages of license are actually higher than the age of majority .
For example , to purchase alcoholic beverages , the age of license is 21 in all U.S. states .
Another example is the voting age , which prior to the 1970s was 21 in the US , as was the age of majority in all or most states .
In the Republic of Ireland the age of majority is 18 , but one must be over 21 years of age to stand for election to the Houses of the Oireachtas .
Also , in Portugal the age of majority is 18 , but one must be at least 25 years of age to run for public office .
A child who is legally emancipated by a court of competent jurisdiction automatically attains to their maturity upon the signing of the court order .
Only emancipation confers the status of maturity before a person has actually reached the age of majority .
In almost all places , minors who are married are automatically emancipated .
Some places also do the same for minors who are in the armed forces or who have a certain degree or diploma .
CIVIL LAW
Section::::Civil law .
In many countries minors can be emancipated : depending on jurisdiction , this may happen through acts such as marriage , attaining economic self - sufficiency , obtaining an educational degree or diploma , or participating in a form of military service .
