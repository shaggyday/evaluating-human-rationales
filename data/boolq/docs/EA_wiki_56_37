LIST OF CURRENT PREMIER LEAGUE AND ENGLISH FOOTBALL LEAGUE
MANAGERS
There are 92 association football teams in the top four tiers of English football , all of which have a manager , or pair of joint managers , sometimes given the alternative title of head coach .
The Premier League and the English Football League are the only fully professional football leagues in England .
The Premier League consists of 20 clubs at the top of the English football league system .
The remaining 72 clubs are split into the three divisions of the English Football League : the Championship , League One and League Two .
Some managers listed have had more than one spell in charge at their current club or had spells at more than one club , however this table deals only with their current appointment .
This list includes every manager currently managing a club in the Premier League and the English Football League , in order of the date that they took up their appointment : this is not necessarily the date on which they were appointed , so there may be a discrepancy between the date appointed and the time as manager .
Jim Bentley is the longest - serving current manager , having managed Morecambe since 2011 .
