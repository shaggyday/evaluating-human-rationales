In geometry , a pyramid is a polyhedron formed by connecting a polygonal base and a point , called the apex .
Each base edge and apex form a triangle , called a lateral face .
It is a conic solid with polygonal base .
A pyramid with an n - sided base has vertices , faces , and 2n edges .
All pyramids are self - dual .
A right pyramid has its apex directly above the centroid of its base .
Nonright pyramids are called oblique pyramids .
A regular pyramid has a regular polygon base and is usually implied to be a right pyramid .
When unspecified , a pyramid is usually assumed to be a regular square pyramid , like the physical pyramid structures .
A triangle - based pyramid is more often called a tetrahedron .
Among oblique pyramids , like acute and obtuse triangles , a pyramid can be called acute if its apex is above the interior of the base and obtuse if its apex is above the exterior of the base .
A right - angled pyramid has its apex above an edge or vertex of the base .
In a tetrahedron these qualifiers change based on which face is considered the base .
Pyramids are a class of the prismatoids .
Pyramids can be doubled into bipyramids by adding a second offset point on the other side of the base plane .
RIGHT PYRAMIDS WITH
A REGULAR BASE Section::::Right pyramids with a regular base .
A right pyramid with a regular base has isosceles triangle sides , with symmetry is C or [ 1,n ] , with order 2n .
It can be given an extended Schläfli symbol ( ) ∨ { n } , representing a point , ( ) , joined ( orthogonally offset ) to a regular polygon , { n } .
A join operation creates a new edge between all pairs of vertices of the two joined figures .
The trigonal or triangular pyramid with all equilateral triangle faces becomes the regular tetrahedron , one of the Platonic solids .
A lower symmetry case of the triangular pyramid is C , which has an equilateral triangle base , and 3 identical isosceles triangle sides .
The square and pentagonal pyramids can also be composed of regular convex polygons , in which case they are Johnson solids .
If all edges of a square pyramid ( or any convex polyhedron ) are tangent to a sphere so that the average position of the tangential points are at the center of the sphere , then the pyramid is said to be canonical , and it forms half of a regular octahedron .
Pyramids with a hexagon or higher base must be composed of isosceles triangles .
A hexagonal pyramid with equilateral triangles would be a completely flat figure , and a heptagonal or higher would have the triangles not meet at all .
RIGHT STAR PYRAMIDS Section::::Right Star pyramids .
Right pyramids with regular star polygon bases are called star pyramids .
For example , the pentagrammic pyramid has a pentagram base and 5 intersecting triangle sides .
RIGHT PYRAMIDS WITH AN IRREGULAR BASE Section::::Right pyramids with an irregular base .
A right pyramid can be named as ( ) ∨P , where ( ) is the apex point , ∨ is a join operator , and P is a base polygon .
An isosceles triangle
right tetrahedron can be written as ( ) ∨
[ ( ) ∨ { } ]
as the join of a point to an isosceles triangle base , as [ ( ) ∨ ( ) ] ∨ { } or { } ∨ { } as the join ( orthogonal offsets ) of two orthogonal segments , a digonal disphenoid , containing 4 isosceles triangle faces .
It has C symmetry from two different base - apex orientations , and C in its full symmetry .
A rectangular right pyramid , written as ( ) ∨ [ { } × { } ] , and a rhombic pyramid , as ( ) ∨ [ { } + { } ]
, both have symmetry C.

Rhombic pyramid VOLUME Section::::Volume .
The volume of a pyramid ( also any cone ) is formula_1 , where b is the area of the base and h the height from the base to the apex .
This works for any polygon , regular or non - regular , and any location of the apex , provided that h is measured as the perpendicular distance from the plane containing the base .
In 499 AD Aryabhata , a mathematician - astronomer from the classical age of Indian mathematics and Indian astronomy , used this method in the Aryabhatiya ( section 2.6 ) .
The formula can be formally proved using calculus .
By similarity , the linear dimensions of a cross - section parallel to the base increase linearly from the apex to the base .
The scaling factor ( proportionality factor ) is formula_2 , or formula_3 , where h is the height and y is the perpendicular distance from the plane of the base to the cross - section .
Since the area of any cross - section is proportional to the square of the shape 's scaling factor , the area of a cross - section at height y is formula_4 , or since both b and h are constants , formula_5 .
The volume is given by the integral
The same equation , formula_1 , also holds for cones with any base .
This can be proven by an argument similar to the one above ; see volume of a cone .
For example , the volume of a pyramid whose base is an n - sided regular polygon with side length s and whose height is h is The formula can also be derived exactly without calculus for pyramids with rectangular bases .
Consider a unit cube .
Draw lines from the center of the cube to each of the 8 vertices .
This partitions the cube into 6 equal square pyramids of base area 1 and height 1/2 .
Each pyramid clearly has volume of 1/6 .
From this we deduce that pyramid volume = height × base area
/ 3 .
Next , expand the cube uniformly in three directions by unequal amounts so that the resulting rectangular solid edges are a , b and c , with solid volume abc .
Each of the 6 pyramids within are likewise expanded .
And each pyramid has the same volume abc/6 .
Since pairs of pyramids have heights a/2 ,
b/2 and c/2 , we see that pyramid volume = height × base area / 3 again .
When the side triangles are equilateral , the formula for the volume is
This formula only applies for n = 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 ; and it also covers the case n = 6 , for which the volume equals zero ( i.e. , the pyramid height is zero ) .
SURFACE AREA Section::::Surface area .
The surface area of a pyramid is formula_10 , where B is the base area , P is the base perimeter , and the slant height
formula_11 , where h is the pyramid altitude and r is the inradius of the base .
N - DIMENSIONAL PYRAMIDS Section::::n - dimensional pyramids .
A 2-dimensional pyramid is a triangle , formed by a base edge connected to a noncolinear point called an apex .
A 4-dimensional pyramid is called a polyhedral pyramid , constructed by a polyhedron in a 3-space hyperplane of 4-space with another point off that hyperplane .
Higher - dimensional pyramids are constructed similarly .
The family of simplices represent pyramids in any dimension , increasing from triangle , tetrahedron , 5-cell , 5-simplex , etc .
A n - dimensional simplex has the minimum n+1 vertices , with all pairs of vertices connected by edges , all triples of vertices defining faces , all quadruples of points defining tetrahedral cells , etc .
POLYHEDRAL PYRAMID
Section::::Polyhedral pyramid .
In 4-dimensional geometry , a polyhedral pyramid is a 4-polytope constructed by a base polyhedron cell and an apex point .
The lateral facets are pyramid cells , each constructed by one face of the base polyhedron and the apex .
The vertices and edges of polyhedral pyramids form examples of apex graphs , graphs formed by adding one vertex ( the apex ) to a planar graph ( the graph of the base ) .
The regular 5-cell ( or 4-simplex ) is an example of a tetrahedral pyramid .
Uniform polyhedra with circumradii less than 1 can be make polyhedral pyramids with regular tetrahedral sides .
A polyhedron with v vertices , e edges , and f faces can be the base on a polyhedral pyramid with v+1 vertices , e+v edges , f+e faces , and 1+f cells .
A 4D polyhedral pyramid with axial symmetry can be visualized in 3D with a Schlegel diagram — a 3D projection that places the apex at the center of the base polyhedron .

Any convex 4-polytope can be divided into polyhedral pyramids by adding an interior point and creating one pyramid from each facet to the center point .
This can be useful for computing volumes .
The 4-dimensional volume of a polyhedral pyramid is 1/4 of the volume of the base polyhedron times its perpendicular height , compared to the area of a triangle being 1/2 the length of the base times the height and the volume of a pyramid being 1/3 the area of the base times the height .
