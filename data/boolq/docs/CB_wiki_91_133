WIMBLEDON BRANCH Section::::Wimbledon branch .
Parliamentary approval for a line from Wimbledon to Sutton had been obtained by the Wimbledon and Sutton Railway ( W&SR ) in 1910 , but work had been delayed by the First World War .
From the W&SR 's inception , the District Railway ( DR , now the District line ) was a shareholder of the company and had rights to run trains over the line when built .
In the 1920s , the Underground Electric Railways Company of London ( UERL , precursor of London Underground ) planned , through its ownership of the DR , to use part of the route for an extension of the City and South London Railway ( C&SLR , now the Northern line ) to Sutton .
The SR objected and an agreement was reached that enabled the C&SLR to extend as far as Morden in exchange for the UERL giving up its rights over the W&SR route .
The SR subsequently built the line , one of the last to be built in the London area .
In both the 1910 and 1920s proposals , the next station towards Wimbledon was to be Cheam on Cheam Road , but the SR dropped this station and replaced it with West Sutton station .
The line opened on 5 January 1930 when full services on the line were extended from South Merton .
