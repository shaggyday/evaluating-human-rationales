HISTORY OF UNI NICKNAME Section::::History of UNI nickname .
On September 8 , 1931 , the following appeal appeared in the student newspaper , the College Eye , under the headline " Contest Started for School Name " : " Who wants to be called Tutors , Pedagogues , and Teachers all the time ?
Every leading school in the country has some name by which they are known in the realm of sport .
Iowa is known as the Hawkeyes , Minnesota as Gophers , Chicago as Maroons , and so forth .
Why not give Iowa State Teachers College a name which signifies something characteristic about the school besides the fact that it is a teachers college ? "
The article goes on to note that entries would be judged by a member of the Department of Physical Education , other faculty , and students .
When the contest was announced , the Iowa State Teachers College had already been participating in intercollegiate athletics on a regular and organized basis for over thirty - five years .
Teachers College teams had participated in contests with other Iowa colleges , and occasionally with teams from outside the state , in baseball , football , basketball , and track and field .
Until the end of World War I , students certainly did get excited about these contests , but they probably took just as much pleasure in the success of the school 's debate and oratorical teams .
The school 's sole mission , the preparation of teachers , tended to attract many more women than men to the Teachers College .
And , consequently , the school did not have an abundance of material from which to draw its athletes in the days when only men participated in intercollegiate athletics .
Following the war , however , the college made a distinct effort to attract men to the teaching profession .
An important part of this effort was the addition of physical education courses to the curriculum that would help to prepare men for teaching positions that included athletics coaching responsibilities .
Improved athletics facilities , including the construction of the West Gymnasium , showed that the school was taking a more serious attitude toward intercollegiate athletics .
On September 18 , 1931 , the College Eye announced that Paul Bender , acting head of the Department of Physical Education for Men ; George Holmes , professor of journalism ; Robert Burley , president of the Student Council ; and the sports editor of the College Eye would judge entries .
The winner would receive a leather briefcase from the Berg Drug Company .
Second place would be a dresser alarm clock from Chase Jewelry Store .
Third place would be a season football pass .
