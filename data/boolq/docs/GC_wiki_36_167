CULMINATING PROJECT
A culminating project ( also known as a senior project , grad project or exit project ) , is a project that challenges high school seniors to demonstrate their academic knowledge in an experiential way ( in most cases ) .
According to the US Dept of Education State Education Boards typically allow individual school districts to customize the project , based on basic state guidelines .
CONFUSION ABOUT THE CULMINATING PROJECT Section::::Confusion about the culminating project .
People reporting on the culminating project sometimes confuse the terminology with the state high school exit exam .
The state exit exam is a written exam that usually tests student 's math , reading , writing , and science skills , whereas the culminating project is a required project that is usually a learning experience based on a topic chosen by the student .
The project is mandatory in order to graduate .
PURPOSE
Section::::Purpose .
The purpose of the project is to increase both teaching and learning .
High school graduation standards have declined for several decades .
School reform or the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 is a way to bring value back to the high school diploma as well as support students as they go out into the world prepared for college , a job , the military , entrepreneurship , internship , or whatever path students decide to follow once they graduate .
WHY A PROJECT IS REQUIRED Section::::Why a project is required .
The requirement is an effort to increase the education standards .
As college admissions and the workplace require more from their recruits , nationwide high schools must also .
In an effort to be clear , it is restated that the culminating project is not required by all schools .
Again , parents and guardians would have to check with the student 's school official website for graduation requirements .
However , for students that are required to complete a culminating project , this is a chance for the student to explore a topic of personal interest .
The project provides an opportunity that student may not have otherwise .
By completing the project , students have a real life experience that can help them in their next adventure in life ( college , job , entrepreneurship , military , internship , etc . ) .
Students gain a number of important skills by participating in the process such as , * Leadership * Communication * Project management
* Time management * Group skills
* Negotiation skills
* Meeting deadlines
* Conflict management
*
Public speaking
* Presentation skills * Self motivation KINDS OF PROJECTS Section::::Kinds of projects .
The high school graduation culminating project format varies from state to state and even school to school within the same state .
Parents and guardians will have to check with their students specific school for their requirements .
Typically the project consists of choosing a topic of interest , writing a research paper on that topic , having an experience directly related to the topic , keeping a journal of artifacts demonstrating your work , followed by the final step which is a presentation ( US Dept of Education ) .
The student usually presents the project to a panel consisting of 2 - 5 people typically made up of teachers , community members , faculty , and staff .
However , some schools have student present to a panel of their peers .
Schools and school districts have total discretion to format the process in a way that works best for their students and their school culture .
In some cases , students complete a project on their own with the support of a mentor from their community .
Some schools allow group projects and group presentation .
For example , it would not be uncommon for the leadership class of a school to raise funds to build a school in Africa .
Other requirements include a mandatory social / community aspect related to the project which means the high school graduation project has to benefit someone other than the student .
