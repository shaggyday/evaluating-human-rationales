ENTITY CLASSIFICATION
ELECTION
For United States income tax purposes , a business entity may elect to be treated either as a corporation or as other than a corporation .
This entity classification election is made by filing Internal Revenue Service Form 8832 .
Absent filing the form , a default classification applies .
U.S. corporations of the type that can be publicly traded must be treated as corporations .
There is a list of specific foreign entities that must be treated as corporations .
The election is effective for Federal and most state income tax purposes .
If an entity is not classified as a corporation , it is treated as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes if it has more than one owner , or is a disregarded entity if it has a single owner ( i.e. is treated as part of the single owner ) .
The classification of either a U.S. or non - U.S. entity for U.S. tax purposes has no effect for purposes other than U.S. income tax .
ELIGIBILITY TO MAKE AN ELECTION Section::::Eligibility to make an election .
An entity , which is eligible to make an election , is referred to as an eligible entity .
Generally , a corporation organized under U.S. federal or state statute ( and referred to as a corporation , body corporate or body politic by that statute ) is not an eligible entity .
However , the following types of business entity are treated as eligible entities : * An eligible entity that previously elected to be an association taxable as a corporation by filing Form 8832 .
An entity that elects to be classified as a corporation by filing Form 8832 can make another election to change its classification , subject to the 60-month limitation rule .
*
* A foreign eligible entity that became an association taxable as a corporation under the foreign default rule described below .
* * A foreign corporation that is not identified as a corporation under Treasury regulations § 301.7701 - 2(b)(8 ) .
If a foreign corporation is not identified on the list included in these regulations , it qualifies as an eligible entity .

DEFAULT CLASSIFICATION Section::::Default classification .
An eligible entity is classified for federal tax purposes under the default rules described below unless it files Form 8832 or Form 2553 , Election by a Small Business Corporation , to elect a classification or change its current classification .
The IRS uses the information entered on the form to establish the entity 's filing and reporting requirements for federal tax purposes .
Certain domestic and foreign entities that were in existence before January 1 , 1997 , and have an established federal tax classification generally do not need to make an election to continue that classification .
If an existing entity decides to change its classification , it may do so subject to the 60-month limitation rule .
Unless an election is made on Form 8832 , a domestic eligible entity will be classified by default as : * A partnership if it has two or more members .
*
* Disregarded as an entity separate from its owner if it has a single owner .
A change in the number of members of an eligible entity classified as an association ( defined below ) does not affect the entity 's classification .
However , an eligible entity classified as a partnership will become a disregarded entity when the entity 's membership is reduced to one member and a disregarded entity will be classified as a partnership when the entity has more than one member .
* Unless an election is made on Form 8832 , a foreign eligible entity will be classified by default as : * A partnership if it has two or more members and at least one member does not have limited liability .
* * An association taxable as a corporation if all members have limited liability .
*
* Disregarded as an entity separate from its owner if it has a single owner that does not have limited liability .
*
The effect of these rules is that a U.S. limited liability company ( LLC ) or limited liability partnership ( LLP ) is treated by default as a partnership ( or disregarded entity if it has only one owner ) , whereas a foreign LLP is treated by default as a corporation ( if , as is generally the case , all its members have limited liability ) .
If an entity has been operating under one classification for some time , but then elects to change its classification , there may be tax consequences .
The initial regulations were unclear on this point , so the IRS issued Revenue Rulings 99 - 5 and 99 - 6 in 1999 to address questions surrounding the conversion of an LLC to a partnership and vice versa .
USE IN INTERNATIONAL TAX PLANNING Section::::Use in international tax planning .
The " check - the - box " regulations paved the way for various new tax avoidance and tax deferral strategies .
Specifically , they expanded the opportunity for " hybrid branch " or " hybrid entity " strategies , which take advantage of differences in the classification of an entity as a corporation or not in multiple jurisdictions , in order to engage in cross - border tax arbitrage .
The possibility that the check - the - box rules would greatly expand the potential for such strategies had been pointed out prior to implementation , and at one point some commentators suggested disallowing foreign entities from electing their classification at all ; however , in the end , the IRS , while acknowledging such concerns , issued regulations which gave foreign and domestic entities largely similar powers to elect their own classification .
US owners of foreign subsidiaries benefit from the ability to have those foreign subsidiaries treated as disregarded entities .
Under the United States ' Internal Revenue Code Subpart F , payments between related Controlled Foreign Corporations ( CFCs ) , or from American companies to related CFCs , may be " treated as Subpart F income " ( subject to current taxation as if they were profits in the hands of the ultimate American owner of the corporate structure ) , in an effort to limit the ability of American citizens and corporations to defer US tax on the income of foreign corporations they control .
However , payments between an American - owned foreign entity which is taxed as a corporation , and a foreign subsidiary of that entity which itself has elected to be treated as a disregarded entity , are not treated as Subpart F income .
This arrangement may be used to shift income between the two non - American jurisdictions and avoid local taxes in one or the other , e.g. through thin capitalization .
Another category of US taxpayers who benefit from check - the - box regulations consists of US flow - through entities ( S corporations and partnerships ) with foreign subsidiaries .
If the foreign subsidiary is treated as a corporation , the taxes it pays to the foreign government do not create a foreign tax credit for the US owner under Section 902 .
However , with a check - the - box election to be treated as a disregarded entity , the foreign taxes are treated as having been directly imposed on the US owner , thus giving rise to the tax credit .
For US owners with foreign subsidiaries , choosing to have a subsidiary treated as a disregarded entity is not always the most beneficial tax - planning choice , however .
For example , if a US taxpayer owns a disregarded foreign entity , its income will be taxed at the owner 's ordinary US income tax rates , less the foreign tax already paid .
This may result in every marginal dollar being taxed at the highest rate .
However , if the foreign entity had elected to be taxed as a corporation ( or been classified as such by default ) , paid a low rate tax in the foreign country , then repatriated its income to the US by paying qualified dividends to its owner , the total proportion of tax paid on income might actually be less , as qualified dividends are only taxed at 15 % .
However , this treatment is only available for dividends from corporations in certain countries , and is set to sunset in 2010 under the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 .
Foreign owners of US corporations also benefit from the ability to have entities normally treated as flow - through instead be taxed as corporations by the IRS .
In what is sometimes known as a " domestic reverse hybrid " strategy , a non - US corporation may set up a US holding company which elects to be treated as a corporation for US tax purposes , but which its home country tax law sees as a flow - through entity .
The US holding company receives a loan from its home country parent which it invests in a US operating subsidiary ; the US holding company receives dividends from the US operation subsidiary and pays interest to the non - US parent .
US tax law thus sees a US company making a dividend payment to another US company ( which is thus not subject to withholding tax , unlike a dividend paid to a foreign company ) which then pays interest to a foreign company , while the home country tax law will see a US company paying dividends directly to its home country parent .
Under typical treaties for the relief of double taxation , neither government has the right to tax the payment , because each sees it as a type of payment which only the other has the right to tax .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Prior to 1996 , whether domestic and foreign entities were classified as corporations was based on a six - factor test which looked at : * limited liability ;
* * continuity of life ; * * free transferability of interests ; * * centralized management ; * * associates ; * * objective to carry on business for joint profit
*
An entity which had a preponderance of the first four factors ( the last two , in practice , were shared by all business entities ) was treated as a corporation , otherwise as a partnership or an association .
In practice , however , this test was easily manipulated .
The " check - the - box " regulations ( Treasury Decision 8697 ) were adopted in 1996 in order to simplify the issue of entity classification .
A grandfather clause allowed entities in existence on May 8 , 1996 to continue using their previous classification , even if they would no longer be eligible to elect that classification under the new rules .
There were three conditions for this grandfathering :
* the entity had a reasonable basis ( within the meaning of section 6662 ) for its claimed classification ; * * the entity and all owners recognized the federal tax consequences of any change in classification within 60 months prior to January 1 , 1997 ; and * * neither the entity nor its owners had been advised that the entity was under examination on or before May 8 , 1996 .
*
The initial regulations also included a list of foreign entities which would always be classified as corporations ( " per - se corporations " ) and which could not elect to be disregarded .
The proposed regulations included naamloze vennootschap formed under the laws of Aruba or the Netherlands Antilles in that list , but they were removed from the final list ; conversely , Canadian corporations were added to the list .
In 1998 , the IRS issued Notice 98 - 11 , 1998 - 1 C.B. 433 in an attempt to combat the use of " check - the - box " in international tax planning ( see below ) ; however , the notice met opposition , and was withdrawn by Notice 98 - 35 , 1998 - 2 C.B. 34 .
Another proposal , around 1999 , would have left the basic check - the - box regime in place , but allowed the IRS to disregard entity classification elections made in connection with " extraordinary transactions " ( where the tax liability changes " significantly " as a result of the election ) .
An " extraordinary transaction " was defined as one in which there was a sale , exchange , transfer , or other disposition of a 10-percent or greater interest in a foreign entity ; the proposed regulations provided that an election to be classified as a disregarded entity could be ignored , and thus the entity continue to be taxed as a corporation , if the election occurred within twelve months following the day before an extraordinary transaction .
However , various tax professionals opposed the changes , arguing that the threshold for defining an extraordinary transaction was far too low , and that existing internal revenue regulations , as well as common law doctrines such as the principle of substance over form and the step transaction doctrine , were already sufficient to combat any abuses of the check - the - box rules .
President Barack Obama attempted to revive the IRS ' 1998 notice in his proposed 2010 budget .
Specifically , the proposal stated : The proposal was eventually dropped again due to criticism from businesses , and it was not included again in the 2011 budget proposal either .
