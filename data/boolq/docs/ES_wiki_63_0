DAN MARINO Daniel Constantine Marino Jr. ( born September 15 , 1961 ) is a former American football quarterback who played seventeen seasons for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League ( NFL ) .
The last quarterback of the quarterback class of 1983 to be taken in the first round , Marino held or currently holds dozens of NFL records associated with the quarterback position .
Despite never being on a Super Bowl - winning team , he is recognized as one of the greatest quarterbacks , and generally considered to be among the best pure passers in American football history .
Best remembered for his quick release and powerful arm , Marino helped the Dolphins become consistent postseason contenders , leading them to the playoffs ten times and one Super Bowl appearance in XIX , although a title victory ultimately eluded him during his career .
Marino is considered by many to be one of the greatest players to never win a Super Bowl and has the most career victories of quarterbacks to not win a title at 155 ( 147–93 in regular season and 8–10 in playoffs ) .
A nine - time Pro Bowl selection , and seven time first or second team All - Pro , Marino was the NFL
Most Valuable Player ( MVP )
in 1984 , when he set single season records of 5,084 passing yards , 48 touchdown passes , nine 300-yard passing games , and four 400-yard passing games .
He was voted the 1994 NFL Comeback Player of the Year , and the 1998 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year .
At the time of his retirement , Marino held more than 40 NFL single season and career passing records ( many of which have since been surpassed ) , including career passing attempts ( 8,358 ) , completions ( 4,967 ) , passing yards ( 61,361 ) , and touchdown passes ( 420 ) .
He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2005 , his first year of eligibility , and is currently one of only three former Miami Dolphins to have his jersey number ( no . 13 ) retired .
EARLY YEARS
Section::::Early years .
Marino was born in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , of Italian and Polish ancestry .
He is the eldest child of Daniel and Veronica ( Kolczynski ) Marino , and has two younger sisters , Cindi and Debbie .
His father delivered newspapers for the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette .
Marino grew up on Parkview Avenue in the South Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh , and attended St. Regis Catholic Elementary School .
He attended Central Catholic High School in Pittsburgh , where he started in baseball , and won Parade All - American honors in football .
He was drafted in the 4th round by the Kansas City Royals in the 1979 amateur draft , but decided to play college football instead .
COLLEGE CAREER
Section::::College career .
Marino attended the University of Pittsburgh , and played for the university 's Pittsburgh Panthers football team from 1979 to 1982 .
As a freshman in 1979 , Marino led the Panthers in a 24–17 triumph over West Virginia in the Backyard Brawl and a 29−14 win over longtime rival Penn State .
Pitt 's 1980 Marino - led team finished No . 2 in the season ending rankings ( The New York Times computer poll rated Pitt as No . 1 ) .
Following the 1981 regular season , Marino led the Panthers , who had been ranked No . 1 most of the season , to a last - minute triumph over the No . 7 Georgia Bulldogs in the 1982 Sugar Bowl by throwing a game - winning pass to tight end John Brown with less than a minute remaining in the game .
Marino later cited this as the most memorable pass he 'd thrown in his college career .
Overall , during the three seasons from 1979 thru 1981 , Pitt garnered 33 wins with only 3 losses ( three straight 11–1 seasons ) and was constantly ranked in the Top 5 of both major media polls .
The Pitt football team 's fortunes and Marinos 's statistics dipped during his senior year , which saw the team transition from head coach Jackie Sherrill to new coach Foge Fazio , culminating in a 7–3 loss in the 1983 Cotton Bowl Classic to Southern Methodist University and their " Pony Express " of Eric Dickerson and Craig James .
Marino finished ninth in voting for the Heisman Trophy in 1982 , after finishing fourth the previous year .
Marino finished his four college seasons with 7,905 passing yards and 74 touchdowns , with 64 interceptions .
NFL DRAFT Section::::NFL Draft .
Marino 's selection status in the 1983 NFL Draft plummeted after his weaker senior season at Pitt , and rumors of recreational drug use .
Five other quarterbacks — Ken O'Brien , Tony Eason , Todd Blackledge , and Hall of Famers Jim Kelly and John Elway — were drafted ahead of him in the first round .
Bill Hillgrove , who was with the Marino family on draft day , later recalled that when the New York Jets selected O'Brien , Marino " became visibly ill " .
( O'Brien , who played for Division II Cal - Davis , was so obscure that Marino later asked his agent Marvin Demoff " Who is Ken O'Brien ? " )
The Miami Dolphins chose Marino as the 27th pick in the first round .
Opinion was divided on the wisdom of the team 's decision ; Chris Berman said that the Dolphins ' head coach Don Shula was " the best " , but Paul Zimmerman was skeptical of the coaching staff 's ability to help Marino " overcome the problems he 's had " .
Shula later said that being passed up by so many teams " motivated [ Marino ] to show everybody else what a mistake that they had made . "
PROFESSIONAL CAREER EARLY YEARS AND SUPER BOWL
APPEARANCE Section::::Professional career .
Section::::Early years and Super Bowl appearance .
Marino was the first draft pick in the history of the United States Football League , selected by the Los Angeles Express .

However , he also threw two interceptions as the team lost to the 9 - 7 Seattle Seahawks , 27 - 20 .
In his second season , Marino broke six NFL full - season passing records , including the records for most touchdown passes ( 48 , surpassed by Peyton Manning in 2004 ) and most passing yards ( 5,084 , surpassed by Drew Brees in 2011 ) , and was selected as the NFL 's Most Valuable Player .
The Dolphins finished with a 14–2 regular season record , clinching home - field advantage for the playoffs .
In the Divisional round , the Dolphins avenged their playoff loss of the previous season to Seattle Seahawks 31–10 behind Marino 's 262 passing yards and 3 touchdowns .

In 1992 , Marino again led the Dolphins to the AFC Championship game while passing for 4,116 and 24 touchdowns .
His 4,116 passing yards led the entire NFL and marked the fifth time in his NFL career that he led the league in passing yards .
In 1993 , Miami was strongly favored at the start of the year to make it back to the AFC championship game and possibly the Super Bowl .
However , after throwing a swing pass at a game in Cleveland , Marino , who was untouched on the play , crumpled to the ground in pain with a torn Achilles tendon and was out for the season .
Marino later said , " I felt like I got kicked " .
Backup quarterback Scott Mitchell had an impressive series of starts before suffering an injury of his own .
Steve DeBerg started the last 4 games of the season .
Mitchell signed a free - agent contract with the Detroit Lions , and Miami signed veteran quarterback Bernie Kosar from the Dallas Cowboys as a backup .
Wearing a special shoe on one foot , and having a right calf that was visibly atrophied , Marino was the starting quarterback at the opening of the 1994 season .
In the 1994 season opener , a home game versus the New England Patriots and quarterback Drew Bledsoe , the two quarterbacks put up a combined 894 yards ( Marino , 473 yards ; Bledsoe , 421 yards ) and nine passing touchdowns ( Marino , 5 ; Bledsoe , 4 ) , with Miami winning 39–35 .
Later in the season , Marino led a comeback win on the road against the New York Jets ( 28–24 ) , a game famous for Marino 's execution of a fake spike for the winning touchdown pass , a play known as " The Clock Play " .
The Dolphins finished 10–6 that year , and Marino passed for 4,453 yards and was named the NFL 's Comeback Player of the Year by the Pro Football Writers Association .
After missing the post - season in 1993 , Miami came back to the playoffs in 1994 .

Marino threw 257 yards and two touchdown passes , contributing to Miami 's 27–17 win .
The Dolphins reached the AFC Divisional Playoff round , where they competed with the San Diego Chargers .
Three touchdown passes by Marino in the first half allowed the Dolphins to lead 21–6 , before the Chargers staged a comeback and took the lead toward the end of the fourth quarter .
In the final moments of the game , Marino tried to set up a good position for a field goal , but with little time left at the Chargers ' 30-yard line , Pete Stoyanovich was forced to attempt a 48-yard field goal .
Stoyanovich missed , ending the game with a 22–21 loss for Miami .
Marino started in 14 out of 16 games in the 1995 season .
He suffered a hip injury in week 6 against the Indianapolis Colts and was replaced by Bernie Kosar in the following two games .
Throughout the regular season , Marino threw 3,668 yards , which included 24 touchdowns .
Despite falling to 9–7 and to third place in the AFC East , the Dolphins again advanced to the playoffs because they placed sixth in the AFC .
In the wildcard round against the Buffalo Bills , Miami dominated in passing – with Marino passing 432 yards – while Buffalo was far ahead of Miami for rushing yards ( 341 yards ) .
In terms of scoring , Buffalo held a wide lead throughout the game .
The Dolphins remained scoreless until the fourth quarter , when they scored 22 points , which included two touchdown passes from Marino .
However , Miami fell well short of a comeback and lost 37–22 .
FINAL SEASON AND RETIREMENT Section::::Final season and retirement .
Marino 's final win was his first playoff road win and his 36th comeback win , as the Dolphins defeated the Seattle Seahawks 20–17 on January 9 , 2000 in the final football game ever in the Seattle Kingdome .
In the next round ( January 16 ) , also on the road , Marino and the Dolphins lost 62–7 to the Jacksonville Jaguars .
The Dolphins ' 55 point margin of loss was the worst in AFC Playoff history .
Marino was replaced by backup Damon Huard after playing one series in the second half .
However , he did end the first half on a high note , leading the Dolphins on an 80-yard scoring drive and throwing a 20-yard touchdown pass to receiver Oronde Gadsden with 20 seconds remaining .
The Jacksonville game marked the end of Jimmy Johnson 's coaching career ; Johnson announced his retirement the next day .
Before the 2000 season , Marino decided to retire , after declining offers from Minnesota , Tampa Bay and his hometown of Pittsburgh when the Dolphins declined his option on his contract .
Marino later admitted that he seriously considered the offer from the Vikings , but that he turned it down not because of his arm , but because he was not sure that his legs could take another season .
He also appreciated the fact that unlike many of his contemporaries , he got to play his entire career with one team .
LEGACY Section::::Legacy .
During Marino 's career , the Dolphins were perennial playoff contenders , reaching the post - season in 10 of his 17 seasons .
He was selected to play in nine Pro Bowls ( 1983–87 , 1991–92 , 1994–95 ) , seven times as a starter , but due to injuries he only played in two of the games ( 1984 , 1992 ) .

In 2010 , he was ranked number 25 on the NFL 's Top 100 Greatest Players list .
