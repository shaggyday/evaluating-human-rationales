CREON
Creon (; Ancient Greek
: Κρέων Kreōn means " ruler " ) , is a figure in Greek mythology best known as the ruler of Thebes in the legend of Oedipus .
He had four sons and three daughters with his wife , Eurydice ( sometimes known as Henioche ) :
Henioche , Pyrrha , Megareus ( also called Menoeceus ) , Lycomedes and Haimon .
Creon and his sister , Jocasta , were descendants of Cadmus and of the Spartoi .
He is sometimes considered to be the same person who purified Amphitryon of the murder of his uncle Electryon and father of Megara , first wife of Heracles .
IN
SOPHOCLES Section::::In Sophocles .
Creon figures prominently in the plays Oedipus Rex and Antigone , written by Sophocles .
OEDIPUS REX Section::::Oedipus Rex .
In Oedipus Rex , Creon is a brother of queen Jocasta , the wife of King Laius as well as Oedipus .
Laius , a previous king of Thebes , had given the rule to Creon while he went to consult the oracle at Delphi .
During Laius 's absence , the Sphinx came to Thebes .
When word came of Laius 's death , Creon offered the throne of Thebes as well as the hand of his sister ( and Laius ' widow ) Jocasta , to anyone who could free the city from the Sphinx .
Oedipus answered the Sphinx 's riddle and married Jocasta , unaware that she was his mother .
Over the course of the play , as Oedipus comes closer to discovering the truth about Jocasta , Creon plays a constant role close to him .
When Oedipus summons Tiresias to tell him what is plaguing the city and Tiresias tells him that he is the problem , Oedipus accuses Creon of conspiring against him .
Creon argues that he does not want to rule and would , therefore , have no incentive to overthrow Oedipus .
However , when the truth is revealed about Jocasta , and Oedipus requests to be exiled , it is Creon who grants his wish and takes the throne in his stead .
ANTIGONE
Section::::Antigone .
In Antigone , Creon is the ruler of Thebes .
Oedipus 's sons , Eteocles and Polynices , had shared the rule jointly until they quarreled , and Eteocles expelled his brother .
In Sophocles ' account , the two brothers agreed to alternate rule each year , but Eteocles decided not to share power with his brother after his tenure expired .
Polynices left the kingdom , gathered an army and attacked the city of Thebes in a conflict called the Seven Against Thebes .
The Thebans won the war , but both sons of Oedipus were killed , leaving Creon as ruler once more , serving as regent for Laodamas , the son of Eteocles .
Creon gives Eteocles a full and honorable burial , but orders ( under penalty of death ) that Polynices ' corpse be left to rot on the battlefield as punishment for his treason .
Such state of non - burial was considered a frightening and terrible prospect in the culture of ancient Greece .
Antigone , the daughter of Oedipus and Jocasta , who is betrothed to Creon 's son Haemon , defies him by burying her brother , and is condemned to be entombed alive as punishment .
Antigone tells Creon that it is the duty of the living to bury the dead and that if a body is not buried then the one who died will wander around in nowhere aimlessly for all eternity .
Creon finally relents after advice from the chorus leader ( choragos ) , after Tiresias tells him to bury the body .
However , when Creon arrives at the tomb where she was to be interred , Antigone has already hanged herself rather than be buried alive .
His son , Haemon , threatens him and tries to kill him but ends up taking his own life .
In Creon 's old age , a descendant of an earlier king of Thebes named Lycus invades Thebes and , after killing Creon , takes the crown .
CHARACTER TRAITS
Section::::Character traits .
Creon is pitted against Antigone , who holds up the will of the gods and the honor of her family above all else ; and thus he appears to be against these values .
His behavior , however , suggests otherwise .
He aggressively preaches the concept of family honor to his son , Haemon .
Creon also believes that his decrees are consistent with the will of the gods and with the best interests of the people , whether true or not .
When a legitimate argument is raised against his course of action by Tiresias , he is in fact completely open to changing course , even before he learns of the deaths of his family members .
DISCREPANCIES Section::::Discrepancies .
The Creon of Oedipus Rex is in some ways different and in some ways similar to the Creon of Antigone .
In Oedipus Rex , he appears to favor the will of the gods above decrees of state .
Even when Oedipus says that , once dethroned , he must be exiled , Creon waits for the approval of the gods to carry out the order once he has been crowned king .
Some explanation for these discrepancies in personality may be drawn from his characterization in the third of the Oedipus plays by Sophocles , Oedipus at Colonus .
Here , Creon takes on another persona : that of the " hard - faced politician " .
He is reasonable and modest , staying calm and maintaining his dignity when condemned by Theseus .
He is a " colorless figure " beyond his official position , which suggests that his differing personality traits in the books are because he is a flexible figure whom poets can characterize as they please .
OTHER REPRESENTATIONS
Section::::Other representations .
Creon is also featured in Euripides ' Phoenician Women , but not in Medea — the latter had a different Creon .
Creon is portrayed as a tyrant in Geoffrey Chaucer 's The Knight 's Tale , and in a later adaptation of the same story , William Shakespeare 's and John Fletcher 's play The Two Noble Kinsmen .
As in Antigone , he refuses to allow the burial of defeated enemies .
His enemies ' widows appeal to Theseus , who defeats Creon in battle .
Though much discussed , he does not appear as a character in either version .
The Roman poet Statius recounts a differing version of Creon 's assumption of power from that followed by Sophocles , in his first - century epic , the Thebaid .
This alternate narrative may have been based on a previous epic of the Theban cycle written by the Greek poet Antimachus in the 4th or 5th century BC .
Antimachus ' work has been lost , but in any case , the classic myths often had more than one variation , and playwrights and poets had some freedom to choose or even innovate for dramatic effect .
In Moira Buffini 's modernisation of the story , Welcome to Thebes , Creon 's widow Eurydice is portrayed as President of Thebes following his death .
Seamus Heaney 's ( 2004 )
The Burial at Thebes includes a note from the writer comparing Creon 's actions to those of the Bush administration .
