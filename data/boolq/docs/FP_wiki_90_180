LIST OF THE OPEN CHAMPIONSHIP CHAMPIONS
The Open Championship is an annual golf competition that was established in 1860 .
It is played on the weekend of the third Friday in July , and is the third of the four major championships to be played each year .
In addition , this championship is conducted by The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews ( R&A ) .
The championship was not held in 1871 due to a disagreement over a new trophy , and from 1915 to 1919 and from 1940 to 1945 due to the First and Second World Wars respectively .
The reigning champion of the competition is automatically invited to play in the other three majors ( Masters , the U.S. Open , and the PGA Championship ) for the next five years .
The prize of the tournament is the Golf Champion Trophy , commonly known as the Claret Jug , and the champion personally keeps the trophy until the next competition the following year .
The champion also receives a gold medal , which they are allowed to keep permanently .
Until 1870 the champion received the Challenge Belt , however when Tom Morris Jr. ( more commonly known as Young Tom Morris ) won the Open Championship three times in a row he won the belt outright , necessitating the need for a new trophy .
Harry Vardon holds the record for the most Open Championship victories , winning six times during his career .
The oldest winner of the Open Championship is Tom Morris Sr .
( or Old Tom Morris ) who was old when he won in 1867 .
His son , Tom Morris Jr. , is the youngest winner of the championship , he was old when he won the 1868 Open Championship .
He also won the most consecutive times with four victories ( 1868–72 ) .
Henrik Stenson holds the dual distinction of being both the most strokes under par for 72 holes ( −20 ) and also recording the lowest total score ( 264 ) when he won in 2016 .
