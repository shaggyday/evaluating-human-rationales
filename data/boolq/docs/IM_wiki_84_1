AGE OF MARRIAGE IN THE UNITED STATES
The minimum age for marriage in the United States is set by each state .
Unlike most Western countries , 18 of the U.S. states do not have a legal minimum age of marriage .
Individuals aged 18 have the free ability to marry in the United States states , except in Nebraska ( 19 ) and Mississippi ( 21 ) .
In addition , no state , except Delaware and New Jersey , forbid minors to marry in certain circumstances , such as parental consent , judicial consent , pregnancy , or a combination of these situations .
In half of the states , children under 16 can be married too .
In the 32 states which have an absolute minimum age set by statute , this age varies between 14 and 18 , while in 18 states there is no statutory minimum age if other legal conditions are met .
Although in such states there is no set minimum age by statute , the traditional common law minimum age is 14 for boys and 12 for girls - ages which have been confirmed by case law in some states .
Over the past 15 years , more than 200,000 minors married in US , and in Tennessee girls as young as 10 were married in 2001 , before the state set a minimum age of 17 in 2018 .
