EYE COLOR Eye color is a polygenic phenotypic character determined by two distinct factors : the pigmentation of the eye 's iris and the frequency - dependence of the scattering of light by the turbid medium in the stroma of the iris .
In humans , the pigmentation of the iris varies from light brown to black , depending on the concentration of melanin in the iris pigment epithelium ( located on the back of the iris ) , the melanin content within the iris stroma ( located at the front of the iris ) , and the cellular density of the stroma .
The appearance of blue and green , as well as hazel eyes , results from the Tyndall scattering of light in the stroma , a phenomenon similar to that which accounts for the blueness of the sky called Rayleigh scattering .
Neither blue nor green pigments are ever present in the human iris or ocular fluid .
Eye color is thus an instance of structural color and varies depending on the lighting conditions , especially for lighter - colored eyes .
The brightly colored eyes of many bird species result from the presence of other pigments , such as pteridines , purines , and carotenoids .
Humans and other animals have many phenotypic variations in eye color .
The genetics of eye color are complicated , and color is determined by multiple genes .
So far , as many as 15 genes have been associated with eye color inheritance .
Some of the eye - color genes include OCA2 and HERC2 .
The earlier belief that blue eye color is a simple recessive trait has been shown to be incorrect .
The genetics of eye color are so complex that almost any parent - child combination of eye colors can occur .
However , OCA2 gene polymorphism , close to proximal 5′ regulatory region , explains most human eye - color variation .
GENETIC DETERMINATION
Section::::Genetic determination .
Eye color is an inherited trait influenced by more than one gene .
These genes are sought using associations to small changes in the genes themselves and in neighboring genes .
These changes are known as single - nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs .
The actual number of genes that contribute to eye color is currently unknown , but there are a few likely candidates .
A study in Rotterdam ( 2009 ) found that it was possible to predict eye color with more than 90 % accuracy for brown and blue using just six SNPs .
There is evidence that as many as 16 different genes could be responsible for eye color in humans ; however , the main two genes associated with eye color variation are OCA2 and HERC2 , and both are localized in Chromosome 15 .
The gene OCA2 ( ) , when in a variant form , causes the pink eye color and hypopigmentation common in human albinism .
( The name of the gene is derived from the disorder it causes , oculocutaneous albinism type II . )
Different SNPs within OCA2 are strongly associated with blue and green eyes as well as variations in freckling , mole counts , hair and skin tone .
The polymorphisms may be in an OCA2 regulatory sequence , where they may influence the expression of the gene product , which in turn affects pigmentation .
A specific mutation within the HERC2 gene , a gene that regulates OCA2 expression , is partly responsible for blue eyes .
Other genes implicated in eye color variation are SLC24A4 and TYR .
A 2010 study on eye color variation into hue and saturation values using high - resolution digital full - eye photographs found three new loci for a total of ten genes , and now about 50 % of eye colour variation can be explained . !

ANCIENT DNA AND EYE COLOR IN EUROPE
Section::::Ancient DNA and eye color in Europe .
People of European descent show the greatest variety in eye color of any population worldwide .
Recent advances in ancient DNA technology have revealed some of the history of eye color in Europe .
All European Mesolithic hunter - gatherer remains so far investigated have shown genetic markers for light - colored eyes , in the case of western and central European hunter - gatherers combined with dark skin color .
The later additions to the European gene pool , the Early Neolithic farmers from Anatolia and the Yamnaya Copper Age / Bronze Age pastoralists ( possibly the Proto - Indo - European population ) from the area north of the Black Sea appear to have had much higher incidences of dark eye color alleles , and alleles giving rise to lighter skin , than the original European population .
CLASSIFICATION OF COLOR Section::::Classification of color .
Iris color can provide a large amount of information about a person , and a classification of colors may be useful in documenting pathological changes or determining how a person may respond to ocular pharmaceuticals .
Classification systems have ranged from a basic light or dark description to detailed gradings employing photographic standards for comparison .
Others have attempted to set objective standards of color comparison .
Eye colors range from the darkest shades of brown to the lightest tints of blue .
To meet the need for standardized classification , at once simple yet detailed enough for research purposes , Seddon et al .
developed a graded system based on the predominant iris color and the amount of brown or yellow pigment present .
There are three pigment colors that determine , depending on their proportion , the outward appearance of the iris , along with structural color .
Green irises , for example , have blue and some yellow .
Brown irises contain mostly brown .
Some eyes have a dark ring around the iris , called a limbal ring .
Eye color in non - human animals is regulated differently .
For example , instead of blue as in humans , autosomal recessive eye color in the skink species Corucia zebrata is black , and the autosomal dominant color is yellow - green .
As the perception of color depends on viewing conditions ( e.g. , the amount and kind of illumination , as well as the hue of the surrounding environment ) , so does the perception of eye color .
CHANGES IN EYE COLOR Section::::Changes in eye color .
Most new - born babies who have European ancestry have light - colored eyes .
As the child develops , melanocytes ( cells found within the iris of human eyes , as well as skin and hair follicles ) slowly begin to produce melanin .
Because melanocyte cells continually produce pigment , in theory eye color can be changed .
Adult eye color is usually established between 3 and 6 months of age , though this can be later .
Observing the iris of an infant from the side using only transmitted light with no reflection from the back of the iris , it is possible to detect the presence or absence of low levels of melanin .
An iris that appears blue under this method of observation is more likely to remain blue as the infant ages .
An iris that appears golden contains some melanin even at this early age and is likely to turn from blue to green or brown as the infant ages .
Changes ( lightening or darkening ) of eye colors during early childhood , puberty , pregnancy , and sometimes after serious trauma ( like heterochromia ) do represent cause for a plausible argument stating that some eyes can or do change , based on chemical reactions and hormonal changes within the body .
Studies on Caucasian twins , both fraternal and identical , have shown that eye color over time can be subject to change , and major demelanization of the iris may also be genetically determined .
Most eye - color changes have been observed or reported in the Caucasian population with hazel and amber eyes .
EYE COLOR CHART ( MARTIN SCALE ) Section::::Eye color chart ( Martin scale ) .
Carleton Coon created a chart by the original Martin scale .
The numbering is reversed on the scale below in the ( later ) Martin – Schultz scale , which is ( still ) used in physical anthropology .
Light and light - mixed eyes ( 16–12 in Martin scale )
Pure light ( 16–15 in Martin scale )
* 16 :
pure light blue
* 15 : gray Light - mixed ( 14–12 in Martin scale ) * 14 : Very light - mixed ( blue with gray or green or green with gray ) * 13 - 12 : Light - mixed ( light or very light - mixed with small admixture of brown ) Mixed eyes ( 11–7 in Martin scale ) Mixture of light eyes ( blue , gray or green ) with brown when light and brown appearance is at the same level .
Dark and dark - mixed eyes ( 6–1 in Martin scale )
* Dark - mixed : 6–5 in Martin scale .
Brown with small admixture of light
* Dark : 4–1 in Martin scale .
Brown ( light brown and dark brown ) and very dark brown ( almost black )
AMBER Section::::Amber .
Amber eyes are of a solid color and have a strong yellowish / golden and russet / coppery tint .
This may be due to the deposition of the yellow pigment called lipochrome in the iris ( which is also found in green eyes ) .
Amber eyes should not be confused with hazel eyes ; although hazel eyes may contain specks of amber or gold , they usually tend to comprise many other colors , including green , brown and orange .
Also , hazel eyes may appear to shift in color and consist of flecks and ripples , while amber eyes are of a solid gold hue .
Even though amber is considered to be like gold , some people have russet or copper colored amber eyes that many people mistake for hazel , though hazel tends to be duller and contains green with red / gold flecks , as mentioned above .
Amber eyes may also contain amounts of very light gold - ish gray .
The eyes of some pigeons contain yellow fluorescing pigments known as pteridines .
The bright yellow eyes of the great horned owl are thought to be due to the presence of the pteridine pigment xanthopterin within certain chromatophores ( called xanthophores ) located in the iris stroma .
In humans , yellowish specks or patches are thought to be due to the pigment lipofuscin , also known as lipochrome .
Many animals such as canines , domestic cats , owls , eagles , pigeons and fish have amber eyes as a common color , whereas in humans this color occurs less frequently .
BLUE Section::::Blue .
There is no blue pigmentation either in the iris or in the ocular fluid .
Dissection reveals that the iris pigment epithelium is brownish black due to the presence of melanin .
Unlike brown eyes , blue eyes have low concentrations of melanin in the stroma of the iris , which lies in front of the dark epithelium .
Longer wavelengths of light tend to be absorbed by the dark underlying epithelium , while shorter wavelengths are reflected and undergo Rayleigh scattering in the turbid medium of the stroma .
This is the same frequency - dependence of scattering that accounts for the blue appearance of the sky .
The result is a " Tyndall blue " structural color that varies with external lighting conditions .
In humans , the inheritance pattern followed by blue eyes is considered similar to that of a recessive trait ( in general , eye color inheritance is considered a polygenic trait , meaning that it is controlled by the interactions of several genes , not just one ) .
In 2008 , new research tracked down a single genetic mutation that leads to blue eyes .
" Originally , we all had brown eyes , " said Eiberg .
Eiberg and colleagues suggested in a study published in Human Genetics that a mutation in the 86th intron of the HERC2 gene , which is hypothesized to interact with the OCA2 gene promoter , reduced expression of OCA2 with subsequent reduction in melanin production .
The authors suggest that the mutation may have arisen in the northwestern part of the Black Sea region , and add that it is " difficult to calculate the age of the mutation . "
Blue eyes are common in northern and eastern Europe , particularly around the Baltic Sea .
Blue eyes are also found in southern Europe , Central Asia , South Asia , North Africa and West Asia .
In West Asia , a proportion of Israelis are of Ashkenazi origin , among whom the trait is relatively elevated ( a study taken in 1911 found that 53.7 % of Ukrainian Jews had blue eyes ) .
The same DNA sequence in the region of the OCA2 gene among blue - eyed people suggests they may have a single common ancestor .
DNA studies on ancient human remains confirm that light skin , hair and eyes were present at least tens of thousands of years ago on Neanderthals , who lived in Eurasia for 500,000 years .
, the earliest light - pigmented and blue - eyed remains of Homo sapiens were found in 7,700 years old Mesolithic hunter - gatherers from Motala , Sweden .
A 2002 study found that the prevalence of blue eye color among the white population in the United States to be 33.8 % for those born from 1936 through 1951 compared with 57.4 percent for those born from 1899 through 1905 .
, one out of every six people , or 16.6 % of the total population , and 22.3 % of whites , has blue eyes .
Blue eyes are continuing to become less common among American children .
Blue eyes are rare in mammals ; one example is the recently discovered marsupial , the blue - eyed spotted cuscus ( Spilocuscus wilsoni ) .
The trait is hitherto known only from a single primate other than humans – Sclater 's lemur ( Eulemur flavifrons ) of Madagascar .
While some cats and dogs have blue eyes , this is usually due to another mutation that is associated with deafness .
But in cats alone , there are four identified gene mutations that produce blue eyes , some of which are associated with congenital neurological disorders .
The mutation found in the Siamese cats is associated with strabismus ( crossed eyes ) .
The mutation found in blue - eyed solid white cats ( where the coat color is caused by the gene for " epistatic white " ) is linked with deafness .
However , there are phenotypically identical , but genotypically different , blue - eyed white cats ( where the coat color is caused by the gene for white spotting ) where the coat color is not strongly associated with deafness .
In the blue - eyed Ojos Azules breed , there may be other neurological defects .
Blue - eyed non - white cats of unknown genotype also occur at random in the cat population .
BROWN Section::::Brown .
In humans , brown eyes result from a relatively high concentration of melanin in the stroma of the iris , which causes light of both shorter and longer wavelengths to be absorbed .
Dark brown eyes are dominant in humans and in many parts of the world , it is nearly the only iris color present .
Dark pigment of brown eyes is common in Europe , South Europe , East Asia , Southeast Asia , Central Asia , South Asia , West Asia , Oceania , Africa , Americas , etc .
as well as parts of Eastern Europe and Southern Europe .
The majority of people in the world overall have brown eyes to dark brown eyes .
Light or medium - pigmented brown eyes can also be commonly found in South Europe , among the Americas , and parts of Central Asia ( Middle East and South Asia ) .
GRAY Section::::Gray .
Like blue eyes , gray eyes have a dark epithelium at the back of the iris and a relatively clear stroma at the front .
One possible explanation for the difference in the appearance of gray and blue eyes is that gray eyes have larger deposits of collagen in the stroma , so that the light that is reflected from the epithelium undergoes Mie scattering ( which is not strongly frequency - dependent ) rather than Rayleigh scattering ( in which shorter wavelengths of light are scattered more ) .
This would be analogous to the change in the color of the sky , from the blue given by the Rayleigh scattering of sunlight by small gas molecules when the sky is clear , to the gray caused by Mie scattering of large water droplets when the sky is cloudy .
Alternatively , it has been suggested that gray and blue eyes might differ in the concentration of melanin at the front of the stroma .
Gray eyes are most common in Northern and Eastern Europe .
Gray eyes can also be found among the Algerian Shawia people of the Aurès Mountains in Northwest Africa , in the Middle East , Central Asia , and South Asia .
Under magnification , gray eyes exhibit small amounts of yellow and brown color in the iris .
GREEN Section::::Green .
As with blue eyes , the color of green eyes does not result simply from the pigmentation of the iris .
The green color is caused by the combination of : 1 ) an amber or light brown pigmentation in the stroma of the iris ( which has a low or moderate concentration of melanin ) with : 2 ) a blue shade created by the Rayleigh scattering of reflected light .
Green eyes contain the yellowish pigment lipochrome .
Green eyes probably result from the interaction of multiple variants within the OCA2 and other genes .
They were present in south Siberia during the Bronze Age .
They are most common in Northern , Western and Central Europe .
In Ireland and Scotland 14 % of people have brown eyes and 86 % have either blue or green eyes , In Iceland , 89 % of women and 87 % of men have either blue or green eye color .
A study of Icelandic and Dutch adults found green eyes to be much more prevalent in women than in men .
Among European Americans , green eyes are most common among those of recent Celtic and Germanic ancestry , about 16 % .
37.2 % of Italians from Verona and 56 % of Slovenes have blue / green eyes .
Green eyes are common in Tabby cats as well as the Chinchilla Longhair and its shorthaired equivalents are notable for their black - rimmed sea - green eyes .
HAZEL Section::::Hazel .
Hazel eyes are due to a combination of Rayleigh scattering and a moderate amount of melanin in the iris ' anterior border layer .
Hazel eyes often appear to shift in color from a brown to a green .
Although hazel mostly consists of brown and green , the dominant color in the eye can either be brown / gold or green .
This is how many people mistake hazel eyes to be amber and vice versa .
This can sometimes produce a multicolored iris , i.e. , an eye that is light brown / amber near the pupil and charcoal or dark green on the outer part of the iris ( or vice versa ) when observed in sunlight .
Definitions of the eye color hazel vary : it is sometimes considered to be synonymous with light brown or gold , as in the color of a hazelnut shell .
Hazel eyes occur throughout Caucasoid populations , in particular in regions where blue , green and brown eyed peoples are intermixed .
RED AND VIOLET Section::::Red and violet .
The eyes of people with severe forms of albinism may appear red under certain lighting conditions owing to the extremely low quantities of melanin , allowing the blood vessels to show through .
In addition , flash photography can sometimes cause a " red - eye effect " , in which the very bright light from a flash reflects off the retina , which is abundantly vascular , causing the pupil to appear red in the photograph .
Although the deep blue eyes of some people such as Elizabeth Taylor can appear violet at certain times , " true " violet - colored eyes occur only due to albinism .
SPECTRUM OF EYE
COLOR MEDICAL IMPLICATIONS Section::::Medical implications .
Those with lighter iris color have been found to have a higher prevalence of age - related macular degeneration ( ARMD ) than those with darker iris color ; lighter eye color is also associated with an increased risk of ARMD progression .
A gray iris may indicate the presence of a uveitis , and an increased risk of uveal melanoma has been found in those with blue , green or gray eyes .
However , a study in 2000 suggests that people with dark brown eyes are at increased risk of developing cataracts and therefore should protect their eyes from direct exposure to sunlight .
WILSON 'S
DISEASE Section::::Wilson 's disease .
Wilson 's disease involves a mutation of the gene coding for the enzyme ATPase7B , which prevents copper within the liver from entering the Golgi apparatus in cells .
Instead , the copper accumulates in the liver and in other tissues , including the iris of the eye .
This results in the formation of Kayser –
Fleischer rings , which are dark rings that encircle the periphery of the iris .
COLORATION OF THE SCLERA Section::::Coloration of the sclera .
Eye color outside of the iris may also be symptomatic of disease .
Yellowing of the sclera ( the " whites of the eyes " ) is associated with jaundice , and may be symptomatic of liver diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis .
A blue coloration of the sclera may also be symptomatic of disease .
In general , any sudden changes in the color of the sclera should be addressed by a medical professional .
ANIRIDIA Section::::Aniridia .
Aniridia is a congenital condition characterized by an extremely underdeveloped iris , which appears absent on superficial examination .
OCULAR
ALBINISM AND EYE COLOR
Section::::Ocular albinism and eye color .
Normally , there is a thick layer of melanin on the back of the iris .
Even people with the lightest blue eyes , with no melanin on the front of the iris at all , have dark brown coloration on the back of it , to prevent light from scattering around inside the eye .
In those with milder forms of albinism , the color of the iris is typically blue but can vary from blue to brown .
In severe forms of albinism , there is no pigment on the back of the iris , and light from inside the eye can pass through the iris to the front .
In these cases , the only color seen is the red from the hemoglobin of the blood in the capillaries of the iris .
Such albinos have pink eyes , as do albino rabbits , mice , or any other animal with a total lack of melanin .
Transillumination defects can almost always be observed during an eye examination due to lack of iridial pigmentation .
The ocular albino also lacks normal amounts of melanin in the retina as well , which allows more light than normal to reflect off the retina and out of the eye .
Because of this , the pupillary reflex is much more pronounced in albino individuals , and this can emphasize the red eye effect in photographs .
HETEROCHROMIA Section::::Heterochromia .
Heterochromia ( heterochromia iridum or heterochromia iridis ) is an eye condition in which one iris is a different color from the other ( complete heterochromia ) , or where a part of one iris is a different color from the remainder ( partial heterochromia or sectoral heterochromia ) .
It is a result of the relative excess or lack of pigment within an iris or part of an iris , which may be inherited or acquired by disease or injury .
This uncommon condition usually results due to uneven melanin content .
A number of causes are responsible , including genetic , such as chimerism , Horner 's syndrome and Waardenburg syndrome .
A chimera can have two different colored eyes just like any two siblings can — because each cell has different eye color genes .
A mosaic can have two different colored eyes if the DNA difference happens to be in an eye - color gene .
There are many other possible reasons for having two different - colored eyes .
For example , the film actor Lee Van Cleef was born with one blue eye and one green eye , a trait that reportedly was common in his family , suggesting that it was a genetic trait .
This anomaly , which film producers thought would be disturbing to film audiences , was " corrected " by having Van Cleef wear brown contact lenses .
David Bowie , on the other hand , had the appearance of different eye colors due to an injury that caused one pupil to be permanently dilated .
Another hypothesis about heterochromia is that it can result from a viral infection in utero affecting the development of one eye , possibly through some sort of genetic mutation .
Occasionally , heterochromia can be a sign of a serious medical condition .
A common cause in females with heterochromia is X - inactivation , which can result in a number of heterochromatic traits , such as calico cats .
Trauma and certain medications , such as some prostaglandin analogues , can also cause increased pigmentation in one eye .
On occasion , a difference in eye color is caused by blood staining the iris after injury .
MATE SELECTION AND TRAITS THAT HAVE BEEN LINKED TO IRIS COLOR SELECTION FOR RARE
IRIS COLORS Section::::Mate selection and traits that have been linked to iris color .
Section::::Selection for rare iris colors .
A study compared the frequency of eye color in commercial advertising models in Brazil and the UK , these countries were chosen because they have inverted frequencies of eye - coloration , with Brazil having an excess of brown and the UK an excess of light - colored eyes .
Models are chosen for their attractiveness , and it was found that , in Brazil , models with light eyes are in a significant excess compared to the levels found in the general population , while , in the UK , models with brown or intermediate eyes were in significant excess over their frequency in the general population .
This suggests that eye color rarity plays a role in sexual attraction , people with rare eye colors being perceived as being more attractive .
Some research indicates that eye color variation is greater in women than in men , which may reflect sexual selection of mates with rare eye colors .
SELECTION THOUGH IMPRINTING OF PARENTAL EYE COLOR Section::::Selection though imprinting of parental eye color .
In contrast to the phenomenon of selection for rarity , scholarship has implied the existence another form of eye color involvement in mate selection .
A study found a significant incidence of the partners of heterosexual people possessing similar eye and hair color to that of their opposite - sex parent .
This is suggestive of a form of parental imprinting on eventual mate selection .
