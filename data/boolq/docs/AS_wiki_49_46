PHASIANIDAE
The Phasianidae are a family of heavy , ground - living birds , which includes pheasants , partridges , junglefowl , chickens , turkeys , Old World quail , and peafowl .
The family includes many of the most popular gamebirds .
The family is a large one , and is occasionally broken up into two subfamilies , the Phasianinae , and the Perdicinae .
Sometimes , additional families and birds are treated as part of this family .
For example , the American Ornithologists ' Union includes the Tetraonidae ( grouse ) , Numididae ( guineafowl ) , and Meleagrididae ( turkeys ) as subfamilies in Phasianidae .
DESCRIPTION Section::::Description .
Phasianids are terrestrial .
They range in weight from in the case of the king quail to in the case of the Indian peafowl .
If turkeys are included , rather than classified as a separate family , then the considerably heavier wild turkey reaches a maximum weight of more than .
Length in this taxonomic family can vary from in the king quail up to ( including elongated tail streamers ) in green peafowl , thus they beat even the true parrots in length diversity within a family of birds .
Generally , sexual dimorphism is seen in size , with males tending to be larger than females .
They are generally plump , with broad , relatively short wings and strong legs .
Many have a spur on their legs , a feature shared only with guineafowl and turkeys .
The bill is short and generally strong , particularly in species that dig for food .
Males of the larger species often have brightly coloured plumage , as well as facial ornaments such as wattles or crests .
DISTRIBUTION AND HABITAT Section::::Distribution and habitat .
The Phasianidae are mostly an Old World family , with a distribution that includes most of Europe and Asia ( except the far north ) , all of Africa except the driest deserts , and south into much of eastern Australia and ( formerly ) New Zealand .
The Meleagridinae ( turkeys ) are native to the New World , while the Tetraoninae ( grouse ) are circumpolar .
The greatest diversity of species is in Southeast Asia and Africa .
The Congo peacock is specific to the African Congo .
The subfamily Perdicinae has a much more widespread distribution .
Within their range , they occupy almost every available habitat except for the boreal forests and tundra .
The family is generally and resident , although some quails undertake long migrations .
Several species in the family have been widely introduced around the world , particularly pheasants , which have been introduced to Europe , Australia , and the Americas , specifically for hunting purposes .
Captive populations of peacocks and chickens have also escaped ( or been released ) and become feral .
BEHAVIOUR AND ECOLOGY Section::::Behaviour and ecology .
The pheasants and partridges have a varied diet , with foods taken ranging from purely vegetarian diets of seeds , leaves , fruits , tubers , and roots , to small animals including insects , insect grubs , and even small reptiles .
Most species either specialise in feeding on plant matter or are predatory , although the chicks of most species are insectivorous .
In addition to the variation in diet , a considerable amount of variation exists in breeding strategies among the Phasianidae .
Compared to birds in general , a large number of species do not engage in monogamy ( the typical breeding system of most birds ) .
The francolins of Africa and some partridges are reportedly monogamous , but polygamy has been reported in the pheasants and junglefowl , some quail , and the breeding displays of peacocks have been compared to those of a lek .
Nesting usually occurs on the ground ; only the tragopans nest higher up in stumps of bushes .
Nests can vary from mounds of vegetation to slight scrapes in the ground .
As many as 18 eggs can be laid in the nest , although 7 - 12 is the more usual number , with smaller numbers in tropical species .
Incubation is almost always performed by the female only , and lasts from 14–30 days depending on the species .
RELATIONSHIP WITH HUMANS Section::::Relationship with humans .
Several species of pheasant and partridge are extremely important to humans .
The red junglefowl of Southeast Asia is the wild ancestor of the domesticated chicken , the most important bird in agriculture .
Ring - necked pheasants , several partridge and quail species and some francolins have been widely introduced and managed as game birds for hunting .
Several species are threatened by human activities .
SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION Section::::Systematics and evolution .
The clade Phasianidae is the largest of the branch Galliformes , comprising more than 150 species .
This group includes the pheasants and partridges , junglefowl chickens , quail , and peafowl .
Turkeys and grouse have also been recognized as having their origins in the pheasant- and partridge - like birds .
Until the early 1990s , this family was broken up into two subfamilies : the Phasianinae , including pheasants , tragopans , junglefowls , and peafowls ; and the Perdicinae , including partridges , Old World quails , and francolins .
Molecular phylogenies have shown that these two subfamilies are not each monophyletic but actually constitute only one lineage with one common ancestor .
For example , some partridges ( genus Perdix ) are more closely affiliated to pheasants , whereas Old World quails and partridges from the genus
Alectoris are closer to junglefowls .
The earliest fossil records of phasianids date to the late Oligocene epoch , about 30 million years ago .
