CRITICAL RESPONSE
Section::::Critical response .
Much like its predecessor , Fifty Shades Darker received negative reviews from critics , who criticized its screenplay , narrative and Dornan 's performance .
On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 10 % based on 176 reviews , with an average rating of 3.3/10 .
The site 's critical consensus reads , " Lacking enough chemistry heat or narrative friction to satisfy , the limp Fifty Shades Darker wants to be kinky but only serves as its own form of punishment . "
On Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating to reviews , the film has a score of 33 out of 100 , based on 39 critics , indicating " generally unfavorable reviews " .
Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of " B+ " on an A+ to F scale , an improvement over the " C+ " earned by its predecessor , while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an 82 % overall positive score and a 68 % " definite recommend " .
Richard Roeper gave the film two out of four stars , saying : " This is one good - looking , occasionally titillating , mostly soapy and dull snooze - fest . "
Vince Mancini of Uproxx acknowledged the film 's flaws , but said watching the film was enjoyable , noting , " Narrative sloppiness aside , as an outsider , sitting through Fifty Shades Darker was a reasonably diverting experience , odd , dumb fun made even more fun by an audience that whooped and shouted at the screen during sex scenes .
I did n't really get it , but I enjoyed the feeling of them having fun , though at two hours plus , it 's a bit of a slog . "
Manohla Dargis writing for The New York Times expressed similar ambiguous opinions regarding the content of the film , stating : I was still rooting for Ms. Johnson in Fifty Shades Darker , even if it proved tough going .
Once again , the story involves the on - and - off , tie - her - up , tie - her - down romance between Anastasia Steele ( Ms. Johnson ) and her billionaire boyfriend , Christian Grey ( Jamie Dornan ) , a guy with sculptured muscles , expensive playthings and dreary issues .
Stuff and kink happens : A gun is fired , a would - be rapist is punished and Anastasia is bound hand and foot .
Mostly , she advances and retreats ( repeat ) , mewls and moans , and registers surprise each time
Christian tries to dominate her outside the bedroom , evincing the kind of stalkerlike behavior that usually leads to restraining orders .
Richard Brody of The New Yorker described the film as inferior to the first , and found fault in the change in directors , stating :
Some of the greatest Hollywood melodramas ( such as Douglas Sirk 's Magnificent Obsession ) featured plotlines of an even more extravagant absurdity than that of Fifty Shades Darker .
Their extreme artifice became a framework for extreme ideas and extreme emotions , even in an era of extreme public reticence about what goes on in the bedroom .
The freedom of the current age of sexual explicitness invites realms of characterization ‚Äî and of intimate imagination ‚Äî that the first film in the Fifty Shades series hints at and the second one utterly ignores .
Fifty Shades Darkers indifference to its characters ' identities , conflicts , and desires is matched by its indifference to its own cinematic substance .
The film 's bland impersonality is grotesque ; its element of pornography is n't in its depiction of sex but in its depiction of people , of relationships , of situations that , for all their unusualness , bear a strong psychological and societal resonance .
There 's nothing wrong with Fifty Shades Darker that a good director could n't fix .
