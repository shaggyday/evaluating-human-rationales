ENGLISH RENAISSANCE
The English Renaissance was a cultural and artistic movement in England dating from the late 15th century to the early 17th century .
It is associated with the pan - European Renaissance that is usually regarded as beginning in Italy in the late 14th century .
As in most of the rest of northern Europe , England saw little of these developments until more than a century later .
The beginning of the English Renaissance is often taken , as a convenience , to be 1485 , when the Battle of Bosworth Field ended the Wars of the Roses and inaugurated the Tudor Dynasty .
Renaissance style and ideas , however , were slow to penetrate England , and the Elizabethan era in the second half of the 16th century is usually regarded as the height of the English Renaissance .
The English Renaissance is different from the Italian Renaissance in several ways .
The dominant art forms of the English Renaissance were literature and music .
Visual arts in the English Renaissance were much less significant than in the Italian Renaissance .
The English period began far later than the Italian , which was moving into Mannerism and the Baroque by the 1550s or earlier .
In contrast , the English Renaissance can only truly be said to begin , shakily , in the 1520s , and it continued until perhaps 1620 .
LITERATURE
Section::::Literature .
England had a strong tradition of literature in the English vernacular , which gradually increased as English use of the printing press became common during the mid 16th century .
By the time of Elizabethan literature a vigorous literary culture in both drama and poetry included poets such as Edmund Spenser , whose verse epic The Faerie Queene had a strong influence on English literature but was eventually overshadowed by the lyrics of William Shakespeare , Thomas Wyatt and others .
Typically , the works of these playwrights and poets circulated in manuscript form for some time before they were published , and above all the plays of English Renaissance theatre were the outstanding legacy of the period .
The works of this period are also affected by Henry VIII 's declaration of independence from the Catholic Church and technological advances in sailing and cartography , which are reflected in the generally nonreligious themes and various shipwreck adventures of Shakespeare .
The English theatre scene , which performed both for the court and nobility in private performances , and a very wide public in the theatres , was the most crowded in Europe , with a host of other playwrights as well as the giant figures of Christopher Marlowe , Shakespeare and Ben Jonson .
Elizabeth herself was a product of Renaissance humanism trained by Roger Ascham , and wrote occasional poems such as On Monsieur 's Departure at critical moments of her life .
Philosophers and intellectuals included Thomas More and Francis Bacon .
All the 16th century Tudor monarchs were highly educated , as was much of the nobility , and Italian literature had a considerable following , providing the sources for many of Shakespeare 's plays .
English thought advanced towards modern science with the Baconian Method , a forerunner of the Scientific Method .
The language of the Book of Common Prayer , first published in 1549 , and at the end of the period the Authorised Version ( " King James Version " to Americans ) of the Bible ( 1611 ) had enduring impacts on the English consciousness .
VISUAL ARTS Section::::Visual arts .
England was very slow to produce visual arts in Renaissance styles , and the artists of the Tudor court were mainly imported foreigners until after the end of the Renaissance ; Hans Holbein was the outstanding figure .
The English Reformation produced a huge programme of iconoclasm that destroyed almost all medieval religious art , and
all but ended the skill of painting in England ; English art was to be dominated by portraiture , and then later landscape art , for centuries to come .
The significant English invention was the portrait miniature , which essentially took the techniques of the dying art of the illuminated manuscript and transferred them to small portraits worn in lockets .
Though the form was developed in England by foreign artists , mostly Flemish like Lucas Horenbout , the somewhat undistinguished founder of the tradition , by the late 16th century natives such as Nicolas Hilliard and Isaac Oliver produced the finest work , even as the best producers of larger portraits in oil were still foreigners .
The portrait miniature had spread all over Europe by the 18th century .
The portraiture of Elizabeth I was carefully controlled , and developed into an elaborate and wholly un - realist iconic style , that has succeeded in creating enduring images .
MUSIC Section::::Music .
English Renaissance music kept in touch with continental developments far more than visual art , and managed to survive the Reformation relatively successfully , though William Byrd and other major figures were Catholic .
The Elizabethan madrigal was distinct from , but related to the Italian tradition .
Thomas Tallis , Thomas Morley , and John Dowland were other leading English composers .
The colossal polychoral productions of the Venetian School had been anticipated in the works of Thomas Tallis , and the Palestrina style from the Roman School had already been absorbed prior to the publication of Musica transalpina , in the music of masters such as William Byrd .
The Italian and English Renaissances were similar in sharing a specific musical aesthetic .
In the late 16th century Italy was the musical center of Europe , and one of the principal forms which emerged from that singular explosion of musical creativity was the madrigal .
In 1588 , Nicholas Yonge published in England the Musica transalpina — a collection of Italian madrigals that had been Anglicized — an event which began a vogue of madrigal in England which was almost unmatched in the Renaissance in being an instantaneous adoption of an idea , from another country , adapted to local aesthetics .
English poetry was exactly at the right stage of development for this transplantation to occur , since forms such as the sonnet were uniquely adapted to setting as madrigals : indeed , the sonnet was already well developed in Italy .
Composers such as Thomas Morley , the only contemporary composer to set Shakespeare , and whose work survives , published collections of their own , roughly in the Italian manner but yet with a unique Englishness ; interest in the compositions of the English Madrigal School have enjoyed a considerable revival in recent decades .
ARCHITECTURE
Section::::Architecture .
Despite some buildings in a partly Renaissance style from the reign of Henry VIII , notably Hampton Court Palace , the vanished Nonsuch Palace , Sutton Place and Layer Marney Tower , it was not until the Elizabethan architecture of the end of the century that a true Renaissance style emerged , influenced far more by northern Europe than Italy .
The most famous buildings are large show houses constructed for courtiers , and characterised by lavish use of glass , as at " Hardwick Hall , more glass than wall " , Wollaton Hall and Hatfield House and Burghley House , the style continuing into the early 17th century before developing into Jacobean architecture .
Lesser , but still large , houses like Little Moreton Hall continued to be constructed and expanded in essentially medieval half - timbered styles until the late 16th century .
Church architecture essentially continued in a late Gothic style until the Reformation , and then stopped almost completely , although church monuments , screens and other fittings often had classical styles from about the mid - century .
The few new church buildings were usually still Gothic in style , as in Langley Chapel of 1601 .
CRITICISM OF THE IDEA OF THE ENGLISH RENAISSANCE Section::::Criticism of the idea of the English Renaissance .
The notion of calling this period " The Renaissance " is a modern invention , having been popularized by the historian Jacob Burckhardt in the 19th century .
The idea of the Renaissance has come under increased criticism by many cultural historians , and some have contended that the " English Renaissance " has no real tie with the artistic achievements and aims of the Italian artists ( Leonardo da Vinci , Michelangelo , Donatello ) who are closely identified with Renaissance visual art .
Whereas from the perspective of literary history , England had already experienced a flourishing of literature over 200 years before the time of Shakespeare , during the last decades of the fourteenth century .
Geoffrey Chaucer 's popularizing of English as a medium of literary composition rather than Latin occurred only 50 years after Dante had started using Italian for serious poetry , and Chaucer translated works by both Boccaccio and Petrarch into Middle English .
At the same time William Langland , author of Piers Plowman , and John Gower were also writing in English .
In the fifteenth century , Thomas Malory ( author of Le Morte D'Arthur ) , John Lydgate , and Thomas Hoccleve were notable figures .
For this reason , scholars find the singularity of the period called the English Renaissance questionable ; C. S. Lewis , a professor of Medieval and Renaissance literature at Oxford and Cambridge , famously remarked to a colleague that he had " discovered " that there was no English Renaissance , and that if there had been one , it had " no effect whatsoever " .
Historians have also begun to consider the word " Renaissance " as an unnecessarily loaded word that implies an unambiguously positive " rebirth " from the supposedly more primitive Middle Ages .
Some historians have asked the question " a renaissance for whom ? , " pointing out , for example , that the status of women in society arguably declined during the Renaissance .
Many historians and cultural historians now prefer to use the term " early modern " for this period , a term that highlights the period as a transitional one that led to the modern world , but attempts to avoid positive or negative connotations .
Other cultural historians have countered that , regardless of whether the name " renaissance " is apt , there was undeniably an artistic flowering in England under the Tudor monarchs , culminating in Shakespeare and his contemporaries .
