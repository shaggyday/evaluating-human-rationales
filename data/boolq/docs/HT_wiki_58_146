PLOT Section::::Plot .
After getting off work at a North Braddock , Pennsylvania , steel mill , Russell Baze catches his brother Rodney at a horse racing simulcast , where Rodney had just bet on a losing horse .
Rodney reveals John Petty loaned the money to him .
Petty owns a bar and runs several illegal games .
Russell visits Petty , pays off some of Rodney 's debt , and promises to pay Petty the rest with his next paycheck if Rodney has not yet paid it off .
Driving home intoxicated , Russell hits another car , killing its occupants , including a little boy .
He is incarcerated for vehicular manslaughter .
While in prison he is informed that his ailing father has died and his girlfriend
Lena has left him for the small town police chief , Wesley Barnes .
Upon his release from prison , Russell returns home and resumes his job at the mill .
The same day , Rodney participates in an illegal bare - knuckle prizefight .
Rodney was supposed to take a " dive " for Petty as a way to repay some of the gambling debt he owes Petty , but during the fight , Rodney becomes enraged against his opponent and wins the fight .
The next morning , Russell finds Rodney 's bloodied knuckle tapes in the trash and confronts him about it .
Russell wants him to work in the mill , but Rodney , a four - tour Iraq war veteran , is too mentally scarred to take a regular job .
Rodney tells Petty that these " nickel and dime " fights will never earn him enough money to pay Petty back .
Rodney then insists that Petty call and organize a more lucrative fight .
Petty reluctantly arranges a fight with Harlan DeGroat , a sociopathic drug dealer from rural New Jersey to whom Petty owes a lot of money .
Russell wants Lena back , but she is pregnant with Wesley 's baby .
Russell unsuccessfully feigns happiness to Lena , saying she will be a great mom , but both know that her pregnancy makes their getting back together an impossibility .
Rodney is told he must purposely lose the fight in New Jersey .
When DeGroat seeks assurances Rodney will lose , Petty promises he will .
Rodney briefly knocks out his opponent , but when hearing Petty pleading with him , Rodney helps the fighter get up , takes a dive , and lets the man pummel his face into a bloody mess .
After the fight , DeGroat asks for the rest of his money , but Petty reminds DeGroat they had agreed in advance that this fight made them even , and DeGroat drops the subject .
While driving back home , DeGroat and his men ambush Petty and Rodney .
DeGroat first shoots and kills Petty , has Rodney dragged into the woods , and kills him , too .
Unknown to anyone , Petty had accidentally dialed his cell phone , which fell onto the car seat and connected to his bartender Dan 's voicemail while recording DeGroat as clear evidence of his murdering Petty .
That night , Russell finds a letter from Rodney , stating this will be his last fight and he wants to work with Russell at the mill .
Wesley informs Russell about Rodney 's disappearance , and Russell and his uncle , Red , set off to find him .
In DeGroat 's town , Russell and Red are stopped by the sheriff , who informs them that DeGroat 's men would kill them if they knew why the two were in town , and , as a favor to Sheriff Wesley , he will escort them to the state line rather than searching and arresting them for illegally carrying concealed weapons .
Upon returning to the mill , Wesley visits Russell and confirms Rodney 's death .
Russell goes to Petty 's office , finds a phone number for DeGroat , and calls him without identifying himself , enticing him to come collect Petty 's debt .
At the bar , Russell sabotages DeGroat 's van to prevent his escape and confronts him .
DeGroat escapes to a nearby , shutdown mill , where Russell shoots him in the thigh .
Russell then follows DeGroat to a field outside the mill as he hobbles off and shoots him in the back .
Russell informs DeGroat that he is Rodney 's brother , as Wesley approaches the field in a squad car .
Wesley pleads for Russell to put down his gun , but Russell proceeds to carefully aim his hunting rifle and shoots DeGroat in the head .
The film cuts to Russell sitting at home at the dining table- Wesley having arranged matters so that Russell avoided prison- and fades to black .

LAWSUIT
Section::::Lawsuit .
Town officials from Mahwah , New Jersey , urged a boycott of the film due to negative depictions of the Ramapough Mountain Indians , an indigenous people living around the Ramapo Mountains , characterizing the film as a hate crime .
Relativity Media responded that the film " is not based on any one person or group " and is " entirely fictional " .
Nine members of the group , eight of whom have the surname of the film 's lead character , DeGroat , filed suit against the makers and other involved parties , claiming that Out of the Furnace portrays a gang of " inbreds " living in the Ramapo Mountains who are " lawless , drug - addicted , impoverished and violent .
"
The lawsuit asserts that " The Defendants , and each of them , knew or should have known that their actions would place Plaintiffs , and/or any person so situated in a false light . "
The suit continues , " The connection between the ethnic slur of ' Jackson Whites ' , with the location of the Ramapo Mountains of New Jersey ' , with a Bergen County Police patrol car , with the surnames ' DeGroat ' and ' Van Dunk ' , is too specific to the Ramapough plaintiffs to be chance , coincidence or happenstance , and implies an element of knowledge on the part of the Defendants , or some of them . "
On May 16 , 2014 , U.S. District Court Judge William Walls , sitting in Newark , New Jersey , dismissed the lawsuit , saying that the film did not refer directly to any of the plaintiffs .
