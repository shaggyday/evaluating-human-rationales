6 ( NEW YORK CITY SUBWAY SERVICE )
The 6 Lexington Avenue Local and < 6 >
Pelham Bay Park Express are two rapid transit services in the A Division of the New York City Subway .
Their route emblems , or " bullets " , are colored since they use the IRT Lexington Avenue Line in Manhattan .
Local service is denoted by a ( 6 ) in a circular bullet , and express service is denoted by a < 6 > in a diamond - shaped bullet ; on the R62A rolling stock , this is often indicated by LED signs around the service logo to indicate local or express service to riders ; a green circle for 6 local trains , and a red diamond for < 6 > trains .
This was inherited from the , the line the 6 received most of its R62As from . 6 trains operate local at all times between Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx and Brooklyn Bridge – City Hall in Lower Manhattan .
During weekdays in the peak direction , < 6 > Pelham Express trains replace 6 local ones north of Parkchester , and run express between that station and Third Avenue–138th Street .
During this time , 6 Pelham Local trains short turn at Parkchester ( except for peak - direction < 6 >
Express trains that return in the opposite direction as 6 Local trains ) .
Weekdays from 9:00 to 11:00 a.m. , select Manhattan - bound < 6
> trains run local from Parkchester to Hunts Point Avenue while select Parkchester - bound 6 trains run express in that section .
The 6 in its current format has run since the implementation of the IRT " H " system in 1918 .
Since 1920 , it has remained largely unchanged , running between Pelham Bay Park and City Hall with a peak - express variant in the Bronx .
In 1945 , the city closed the City Hall Loop station , the 6 former southern terminal in Manhattan .
Since then , most 6 trains have terminated at Brooklyn Bridge , with a few exceptions in later years .
HISTORY Section::::History .
On October 27 , 1904 , local and express service opened on the original subway in Manhattan , following the route of the present IRT Lexington Avenue Line from City Hall to Grand Central–42nd Street .
From there , the service traveled west on 42nd Street on the route of the present 42nd Street Shuttle , and then north on the present IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line to 145th Street .
The current " H " configuration , with separate services along Lexington Avenue and Broadway / Seventh Avenue , was introduced in 1917 .
Full Lexington Avenue local service from City Hall to 125th Street opened on July 17 , 1918 .
On August 1 , 1918 , Third Avenue–138th Street opened with trains running between there and City Hall , making all stops .
On January 17 , 1919 , trains were extended from 138th Street to Hunts Point Avenue , and on May 30 , 1920 , 6 service was extended to East 177th Street .
On October 24 , 1920 , 6 service was extended again to Westchester Square .
On December 20 , 1920 , 6 service was extended to Pelham Bay Park .
From that point on , the current 6 service was formed .
All trains ran local between Pelham Bay Park and Brooklyn Bridge , with some trains terminating at the City Hall loop .
By 1934 , service south of the City Hall station had been discontinued , and late - night service ran from Pelham Bay Park to 125th Street only ;
late night express service on the 4 ran local for the first time that year .
Effective December 31 , 1945 , City Hall station closed with the former Brooklyn Bridge station ( renamed to Brooklyn Bridge – City Hall ) being the permanent southern terminal .
However , the 6 train still uses the loop to get from the southbound to the northbound local track at Brooklyn Bridge - City Hall .
On May 10 , 1946 , late - night service was extended from 125th Street to its previous terminus at Brooklyn Bridge when late night express service on the 4 was restored .
Beginning October 14 , 1946 , weekday rush and Saturday morning
rush peak direction express service started , with Pelham Bay trains using the middle track between East 177th Street and Third Avenue – 138th Street .
This express service saved eight minutes between Third Avenue and East 177th Street .
During this time , 6 trains that ran local in the Bronx when express trains operated began to terminate at East 177 Street to make room for express trains to Pelham Bay Park .
On March 7 , 1949 , the hours of the PM Bronx - bound express service were advanced from 4:30 PM to 3:30 PM , and on June 17 , 1949 , the hours of the AM Manhattan - bound express service were extended from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM .
On September 22 , 1948 , 54 additional cars were placed in service on the 6 train , increasing the lengths of trains from six cars to seven cars .
From December 15 to 22 , 1950 , the weekday rush trains from Pelham Bay Park were extended to South Ferry .
On June 23 , 1956 , Saturday morning express service began operating local on the 6 train .
Starting April 8 , 1960 , late night and weekday evening trains were extended to South Ferry , followed by weekend evening service starting October 17 , 1965 ; however , all trains were again cut back to Brooklyn Bridge by May 23 , 1976 , when the inner loop platform of South Ferry closed .
From March 1 , 1960 , to October 17 , 1965 , the 4 and 6 trains also ran local together in Manhattan late nights when late night express service on the 4 was discontinued for a time .
Beginning on January 13 , 1980 , late night service terminated at 125th Street in Manhattan with the again making all stops south of there .
On the same day , Bronx express service was expanded to operate weekdays , with Pelham Bay trains running express in the peak direction to Brooklyn Bridge in the morning , then to Pelham Bay Park in the afternoon .
This service cut affected 15,000 riders , and was criticized by Manhattan Borough President Andrew Stein as no public hearing was held .
For a few months in 1985 , one scheduled daily 6 train traveled to Atlantic Avenue before turning for Pelham Bay Park .
From January 21 to October 5 , 1990 , late night service was extended back to Brooklyn Bridge when late night express service on the 4 was restored .
But the 6 was then cut back to 125th Street for the last time when late - night express service on the 4 in Manhattan was permanently discontinued .
Effective October 3 , 1999 , the 4 and 6 trains once again began to operate local together in Manhattan late nights when the 6 train was permanently extended back to Brooklyn Bridge .
