UNIVERSITY OF ST .
THOMAS ( MINNESOTA )
The University of St. Thomas ( also known as St. Thomas ) is a private , Catholic , liberal arts , and archdiocesan university located in St. Paul and Minneapolis , Minnesota .
Founded in 1885 as a Catholic seminary , it is named after Thomas Aquinas , the medieval Catholic theologian and philosopher who is the patron saint of students .
St. Thomas currently enrolls nearly 10,000 students , making it Minnesota 's largest private , non - profit university .
Julie Sullivan became its 15th president in 2013 .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Founded in 1885 by John Ireland , archbishop of Saint Paul and Minneapolis , St. Thomas began as an all - male , Catholic seminary .
In 1894 , the liberal arts program became an independent college through a gift from local railroad tycoon James J. Hill , who provided funds to establish the Saint Paul Seminary School of Divinity apart from the college .
In 1903 , the College of St. Thomas established a military program on campus , and it was officially termed a military school by the U.S. War Department in 1906 .
Initially , the school gave out two - year diplomas in commercial and classical programs before awarding its first academic degrees in 1915 .
In 1922 , military training became optional .
From the late 1920s through the mid-1930s , the Holy Cross Fathers , who run the University of Notre Dame , controlled the college 's administration .
The diocese called those priests in to help with the school 's financial problems ; those priests were known as a crisis intervention team of sorts for parochial schools of that time .
During World War II , St. Thomas served as a training base for naval officers , which kept the school open when men who would have attended college were fighting in the war .
After the war , in 1948 , the college established " Tom Town " on the eastern end of the lower quadrant , which is currently the site to the O'Shaughnessey - Frey Library and O'Shaughnessey Education Center .
Tom Town , made of 20 double - dwelling huts , consisted of white , barrack - like housing units for faculty , students and their families .
The units helped to meet housing demand after World War II .
In the latter half of the 20th century , St. Thomas started two of its most notable graduate programs : Education in 1950 and Business Administration in 1974 .
The school became co - educational in 1977 and although women were not allowed to enroll until then , female students from St. Catherine University ( then the College of St. Catherine ) often took classes at St. Thomas .
Women were also present as instructors and administrators on campus but the staff , faculty , and administration has seen a vast increase in female employment since the move to co - education .
In 1990 , the College of St. Thomas became the University of St. Thomas and the following year , the university opened the Minneapolis campus .
In 2001 , St. Thomas reinstated its School of Law at its Minneapolis Campus ; it had been shut down during the Great Depression .
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was the speaker at the Grand Opening .
CAMPUSES SAINT PAUL Section::::Campuses .
Section::::Saint Paul .
The St. Paul campus is home to most undergraduate students .
The main campus , built on a farm site once considered " far removed from town " , is located where St. Paul 's Summit Avenue meets the Mississippi River .
The site was farmed by ex - Fort Snelling soldier William Finn , who received the property as a pension settlement after he accidentally shot himself in the hand while on guard duty .
The western edge of the campus borders the Mississippi Gorge Regional Park .
Summit Avenue , which runs through the middle of the campus , is the country 's longest span of Victorian homes .
This tree - lined avenue includes the Governor 's Mansion , F. Scott Fitzgerald 's townhome , and James J. Hill 's mansion .
In 2005 , a new apartment - style residence hall was built on an existing parking lot .
McNeely Hall was also built the following year .
It is a large classroom building for business that replaced the smaller building of the same name .
A new residential village , more parking ramps , and general planning all have been negotiated successfully with the surrounding neighborhood .
These developments are expected to begin within the next five years .
In early 2012 , St. Thomas completed the final stage of its three building expansion on the St. Paul campus .
The two main additions that were completed are the Anderson Athletic and Recreation Center ( AARC ) and the Anderson Student Center .
These projects were completed in the summer of 2010 and January 2012 , respectively .
The Anderson Athletic and Recreation Center has a field house , basketball arena , weight room , and swimming pool .
The track in the field house is home to the most dominant track team in the MIAC conference .
Other St. Thomas sports that use the AARC 's facilities have also had recent success , including a playoff run for the football team , and a national championship for the men 's basketball team .

CONTROVERSY DESMOND TUTU Section::::Controversy .
Section::::Desmond Tutu .
In 2007 , the president of the University of St. Thomas , Father Dennis Dease , cancelled a planned speech by Nobel Peace Prize laureate and anti - apartheid figure , Desmond Tutu , on the grounds that his presence might offend some members of the local Jewish community .
Many faculty members of Voice for Peace led an email campaign calling on St. Thomas to reconsider its decision , which the president did and invited Tutu to campus .
Tutu declined the re - invitation , speaking instead at the Minneapolis Convention Center at an event hosted by Metropolitan State University .
However , he addressed the issue two days later while making his final appearance at Metro State .
DEMOLITION OF FOLEY THEATER Section::::Demolition of Foley Theater .
In 2008 , plans were announced to the public that the theater department at the University of St. Thomas was to be dissolved and that the school would no longer offer this major .
Declining numbers of theater majors was publicly cited as the reason .
However , during this same time , plans were underway to make space for a new student center to be named after the Anderson family , then the largest single donors to a single private institution in United States history .
Despite protests from senior faculty and students , the decision was made to demolish the theater and dissolve the department the same semester ; though , according to the Dean of St. Thomas 's College of Arts and Sciences , Marisa Kelly , the two decisions were " completely unrelated " .
