GERMANY VS MEXICO
Section::::Germany vs Mexico .
The two teams had faced each other 11 times , including three FIFA World Cup games all of which were German victories : 6–0 in 1978 ( first group stage ) , 2–1 in 1998 ( round of 16 ) , but a 1986 quarter - final game being the most significant , which ended with a German penalty shoot - out victory .
Timo Werner fired a warning shot across the face of Guillermo Ochoa 's goal during the first minutes of the match .
Héctor Moreno headed straight at Manuel Neuer from their clearest opening .
Javier Hernández 's one - two with Andrés Guardado allowed him to spin away from Mats Hummels just inside the Germany half and feed Hirving Lozano down the left .
Lozano then cut inside the resistance offered by the back - tracking Mesut Özil to crash a low right foot shot inside Neuer 's right post .
However , two minutes later , Toni Kroos 's free - kick arrowed towards the top corner .
Ochoa denied the midfielder 's shot , pushing the ball against the crossbar .
Near the end Joshua Kimmich and Werner came close to scoring , but their attempts were unsuccessful .
This defeat represented the first time that Germany had lost the opening game in defence of their trophy .
They beat Argentina 3–1 in 1958 , drew 0–0 with Poland in 1978 , and defeated Bolivia 1–0 in 1994 .
Germany lost their opening match at a World Cup for only the second time , having done so in 1982 , against Algeria .
This is the third consecutive World Cup in which the reigning champion has failed to win their opening match – Italy drew 1–1 with Paraguay in 2010 , while Spain lost 5–1 against the Netherlands in 2014 ; and also the fourth champions failed to win their opening match , as France lost 0–1 to Senegal at the 2002 FIFA World Cup ( all of whom , coincidentally , had been knocked out at the group stage ) .
Germany had 26 shots , the most by a side without scoring in a World Cup fixture since 2006 ( Portugal v England , 29 shots in a 0–0 draw ) .
Mexico beat Germany for only the second time – their last win against them came in a friendly in June 1985 .
Rafael Márquez featured in his fifth World Cup finals , becoming just the third player to achieve this feat – along with Mexico 's Antonio Carbajal and Germany 's Lothar Matthäus .

SWEDEN VS SOUTH
KOREA Section::::Sweden vs South Korea .
The two teams had faced each other four times , most recently in 2005 , a 2–2 draw in a friendly game .
Sweden 's defence was tested by a South Korean attack in the early stages .
Andreas Granqvist was denied a shot at goal by a last - ditch interception by Kim Young - gwon .
Marcus Berg was close to score midway through the first half but his close range shot was beaten away by Jo Hyeon - woo , while South Korea did not manage a single shot on target .
Jo also saved from Ola Toivonen 's header following a free - kick .
In the start to the second half , both sides exchanged chances within the first six minutes .
There was a short delay for Kim Min - woo 's foul on Viktor Claesson to be analysed on video and for the referee to point to the spot but it did not affect Granqvist , who sent Jo the wrong way .
Hwang Hee - chan spurned a glorious opportunity late on , heading wide from 10 yards out , as Sweden ultimately held on for a precious three points .
This was Sweden 's first win in their opening match at a World Cup since beating Mexico 3–0 as hosts in 1958 .
South Korea lost their opening match at a World Cup for the first time since 1998 when they lost 3–1 against Mexico .
Sweden 's goal was the first they had scored in 402 minutes of international football .

SOUTH KOREA VS MEXICO Section::::South Korea vs Mexico .
The two teams had met in 12 matches , including one game at the 1998 FIFA World Cup group stage , won by Mexico 3–1 .
The match was attended by the President of South Korea , Moon Jae - in .
In the 12th minute , Hirving Lozano made a block to deny Lee Yong .
Nine minutes later , Son Heung - min shot a low drive which Héctor Moreno helped to keep out .
Jang Hyun - soo handled Andrés Guardado 's cross and the referee awarded a penalty , Carlos Vela stepped up and sent Jo Hyeon - woo the wrong way .
Two minutes later , Miguel Layún lashed his effort over from close range .
South Korea wanted a penalty of their own after the restart when Moon Seon - min 's strike clipped Carlos Salcedo 's arm , but the referee waved away their appeals .
Jo lunged to his right to tip Javier Hernández 's shot wide .
Lozano drove into space , Vela drew away to the right as the ball went left to Hernández , who checked back and clipped low past Jo .
In the third minute of stoppage time , Son struck from 20-yards into the top - left corner .
Before Son 's goal , South Korea had gone 288 minutes without scoring at the World Cup , their longest ever such drought .
Hernández scored his 50th goal for Mexico , becoming the first player in the history of the Mexican national team to reach that milestone .
Mexico have won back - to - back matches at the World Cup for the first time since winning their first two matches at the 2002 World Cup .

Section::::Germany vs Sweden .
The two teams had met in 36 previous matches , including four FIFA World Cup games , the latest of these being a 2–0 Germany win in the 2006 World Cup round of 16 .
Julian Draxler had a shot blocked from close range before he toe - poked a left - footed effort narrowly wide from a tight angle soon after .
Sebastian Rudy left the field with a bloody nose after a collision with Ola Toivonen moments before he burst into the box to control a Viktor Claesson cross on his chest and lift his shot over Manuel Neuer into the far corner of the net .
Three minutes into the second half , Germany drew level when Timo Werner 's cross found Marco Reus , who met it with his knee and turned the ball into the bottom corner of the net .
With just under 10 minutes left , Jérôme Boateng was dismissed after picking up a second yellow card for a tackle on Marcus Berg , and Neuer then made a one - handed save to deny substitute John Guidetti from a downward header .
Toni Kroos tapped a free - kick short to Reus before sweeping the return pass into the top right corner from left of the penalty area with his right foot .
Kroos ' goal in ( 94.39 ) is the latest winner ever scored on the World Cup stage .
The previous record belonged to Francesco Totti , who found the net late on ( 94.26 ) against Australia in 2006 .
Germany came from behind at half - time to win a World Cup match for the first time since 1974 – which was also against Sweden ( 0–1 at HT , won 4–2 ) .
Sweden have lost a World Cup group - stage match for the first time since June 1990 , when they lost to Costa Rica – this defeat ends a run of 10 group games unbeaten .
Boateng is the first player to be sent off at the World Cup for Germany since Miroslav Klose in 2010 against Serbia .

The two teams had faced each other three times , including two FIFA World Cup games , one at the 2002 FIFA World Cup semi - finals , which ended with a 1–0 victory for Germany , and one at the 1994 FIFA World Cup group stage , a Germany 3–2 victory .
Son Heung - min shot wide from the edge of the penalty area before Marco Reus shot one towards goal at the other end only to see it blocked .
Leon Goretzka drew a one - handed save from Jo Hyeon - woo with a header from the middle of the penalty area , the South Korean goalkeeper diving to his right and pushing the ball away at full stretch .
Two minutes into second - half stoppage time , Son 's corner from the left reached Kim Young - gwon at the far post who scored into the right corner from six yards out with his left foot , the offside decision that followed was overruled by a VAR decision .
Ju Se - jong won the ball off Manuel Neuer who had been at the other end of the pitch in order to join the German attack , thus leaving the goal undefended , and hit a long ball to Son , who ran onto the ball and tapped into an empty net from close range to score the second .
Had Mexico defeated Sweden in their final group stage match that same day , a South Korean victory over Germany by at least two goals would have advanced the South Koreans to the Round of 16 based on goal differences , at the expense of Sweden .
However , since Sweden defeated Mexico 3–0 , the South Koreans were eliminated despite their 2–0 victory over Germany .
This marked the second time that South Korea failed to make the Round of 16 in two consecutive FIFA World Cups , having been eliminated in the group stage at the previous one and in four consecutive World Cups from 1986 to 1998 .
Germany are the fourth defending champions to be eliminated from the group stage at the World Cup in the last five tournaments , following France in 2002 , Italy in 2010 , and Spain in 2014 ; and since the new millennium , all champions eliminated in the group stage have been UEFA members .
This is only the second time that Germany have been eliminated from the first round at the World Cup , having done so in 1938 , while also being the first time since then that Germany fails to finish among the best eight teams of the tournament .
However , this is the first time it happened after the first round was converted back to a group stage format in 1950 .
This was Germany 's first ever defeat against an Asian nation in a World Cup match in what was their sixth such match .
This was South Korea 's first victory ( and clean sheet ) at the World Cup since their 2–0 win over Greece in 2010 .
Son 's goal for South Korea ( 95:52 ) was the latest goal Germany have ever conceded in a World Cup match ( excluding extra - time ) .
This was also the first time Germany finished bottom in the World Cup 's group stage , one of the worst performances in their history ; having been eliminated from the group stage of UEFA Euro 2000 and 2004 .
South Korea 's win also meant that Australia was the only team from the Asian Football Confederation that failed to win a game in their 2018 World Cup campaign .

The two teams had met in nine previous matches , including a 1958 FIFA World Cup group stage match won by Sweden 3–0 .
Sweden got the breakthrough five minutes into the second half , Ludwig Augustinsson volleyed past Guillermo Ochoa when Viktor Claesson 's mishit sat him up .
The referee pointed to the spot when Héctor Moreno slid in on Marcus Berg and Andreas Granqvist shot into the top - left corner .
In the 74th minute , substitute Isaac Thelin flicked on a long throw - in and Edson Álvarez sent the ball into his own net with his arm .
Mexico qualify for the knockout stages for the seventh consecutive World Cup despite this defeat , thanks to South Korea 's 2–0 victory over Germany .
This was Sweden 's biggest win in a World Cup match since they defeated Bulgaria 4–0 in 1994 in the third - place play - off match .
Granqvist is the first Swede to score two or more goals in a single World Cup tournament since Henrik Larsson in 2002 .
This was Mexico 's worst defeat at the World Cup since they were beaten 6–0 by Germany in 1978 .
Jesús Gallardo was shown a yellow card after just 15 seconds in this game – the quickest anyone has ever been booked in the World Cup .
