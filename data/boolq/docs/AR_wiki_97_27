SOCIAL STUDIES
In the United States education system , social studies is the integrated study of multiple fields of social science and the humanities , including history , geography , and political science .
The term was first coined by American educators around the turn of the twentieth century as a catch - all for these subjects , as well as others which did not fit into the traditional models of lower education in the United States , such as philosophy and psychology .
In 1912 , the Bureau of Education ( not to be confused with its successor agency , the United States Department of Education ) was tasked by then Secretary of the Interior Franklin Knight Lane with completely restructuring the American education system for the twentieth century .
In response , the Bureau of Education , together with the National Education Association , created the Commission on the Reorganization of Secondary Education .
The Commission was made up of 16 committees ( a 17th was established two years later , in 1916 ) , each one tasked with the reform of a specific aspect of the American Education system .
Notable among these was the Committee on Social Studies , which was created to consolidate and standardize various subjects which did not fit within normal school curricula into a new subject , to be called " the social studies . "
BULLETIN
NO . 28
Section::::Bulletin No . 28 .
In 1920 , the work done by the Committee on Social Studies culminated in the publication and release of Bulletin No . 28 ( also called " The Committee on Social Studies Report , 1916 " ) .
The 66-page bulletin published and distributed by the Bureau of Education is believed to be the first written work dedicated entirely to the subject .
It was designed to introduce the concept to American educators and serve as a guide for the creation of nationwide curricula based around social studies .
The bulletin proposed many ideas which were considered radical at the time , and it is regarded by many educators as one the most controversial educational resources of the early twentieth century .
In the years after its release , the bulletin received criticism from educators on its vagueness , especially in regards to the definition of Social Studies itself .
Critics often point to Section 1 of the report , which vaguely defines Social Studies as " ... understood to be those whose subject matter relates directly to the organization and development of human society , and to man as a member of social groups . "
