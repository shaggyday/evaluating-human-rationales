HISTORY Section::::History .
The London Marathon was not the first long - distance running event held in the city , which has a long history of marathon events .
The Polytechnic Marathon ( also known as the Poly ) was first held in 1909 .
The current London Marathon was founded in 1988 by former Olympic champion and journalist Chris Brasher and athlete John Disley .
Shortly after completing the New York City Marathon in November 1979 Brasher wrote an article for The Observer newspaper which began : To believe this story you must believe that the human race be one joyous family , working together , laughing together , achieving the impossible .
Last Sunday , in one of the most trouble - stricken cities in the world , 11,532 men and women from 40 countries in the world , assisted by over a million black , white and yellow people , laughed , cheered and suffered during the greatest folk festival the world has seen .
Inspired by the people of New York coming together for this occasion , he asked " whether London could stage such a festival ? "
The following year Brasher and Disley made trips to America to study the organisation and finance of big city marathons ( such as those in New York and Boston ) .
Brasher signed a contract with Gillette for £ 50,000 , established charitable status and outlined six main aims in the hope to mirror the scenes he witnessed in New York and establish the United Kingdom on the map as a country capable of arranging major events .
The London Marathon was born .
The first London Marathon was held on 29 March 1981 , more than 20,000 applied to run .
6,747 were accepted and 6,255 crossed the finish line on Constitution Hill .
The Marathon 's popularity has steadily grown since then .
As at 2009 , 746,635 people have completed the race since its inception .
In 2010 , 36,549 people crossed the line , the biggest field since the race began .
The first wheelchair marathon race was held in 1983 and the event was credited with reducing the stigma surrounding disabled athletes .
In 2013 the IPC Athletics Marathon World Cup was held within the London Marathon featuring athletes of both genders in the T42–T46 and T11–T13 categories .
In August 2013 it was announced that the event would be staged in London until 2017 and feature athletes in the T11-T12 , T13 , T42-T44 , T43 , T45 - 46 , T51 - 52 and the T53 - 54 class .
For many years the London and Polytechnic Marathons competed with each other until , in 1996 , the latter folded in due to the popularity of the former .
Following the Boston Marathon bombings , organisers of the 2013 London Marathon undertook a review of their security arrangements , despite no specific threats against the event .
A 30-second silence was held before the start of the marathon to show respect and support to those affected by the tragedy .
ORGANISATION Section::::Organisation .
The race is currently organised by Hugh Brasher , son of Chris , as Race Director and Nick Bitel as Chief Executive .

Dan Tunstall
Pedoe was the medical director of the London Marathon for 25 years between the first one in 1981 until 2005 .

COURSE
Section::::Course .
The marathon is run over a largely flat course around the River Thames , and spans .
The route has markers at one mile intervals .
Although the race publicity ( athlete advice , timing charts and so on ) is mile - oriented , the individual timing splits that are available to competitors after the event are kilometre - oriented .
The course begins at three separate points : the ' red start ' in southern Greenwich Park on Charlton Way , the ' green start ' in St John 's Park , and the ' blue start ' on Shooter 's Hill Road .
From these points around Blackheath at above sea level , south of the River Thames , the route heads east through Charlton .
The three courses converge after in Woolwich , close to the Royal Artillery Barracks .
As the runners reach the , they pass by the Old Royal Naval College and head towards Cutty Sark drydocked in Greenwich .
Heading next into Deptford and Surrey Quays / Rotherhithe in the Docklands , and out towards Bermondsey , competitors race along Jamaica Road before reaching the half - way point as they cross Tower Bridge .
Running east again along The Highway through Wapping , competitors head up towards Limehouse and into Mudchute in the Isle of Dogs via Westferry Road , before heading into Canary Wharf .
As the route leads away from Canary Wharf into Poplar , competitors run west down Poplar High Street back towards Limehouse and on through Commercial Road .
They then move back onto The Highway , onto Lower and Upper Thames Streets .
Heading into the final leg of the race , competitors pass The Tower of London on Tower Hill .
In the penultimate mile along The Embankment , the London Eye comes into view , before the athletes turn right into Birdcage Walk to complete the final , catching the sights of Big Ben and Buckingham Palace , and finishing in The Mall alongside St. James 's Palace .
This final section of the route formed part of the 2012 Olympic Marathon Course .
Since the first marathon , the course has undergone very few route changes .
In the first race , the course took a diversion around Southwark Park before re - joining Jamaica Road on the way to Tower Bridge and was routed through St Katherine Docks past the Tower Hotel , en route to the Tower of London and the cobblestoned stretch of road that in later years was carpeted , to help runners prevent injury on the uneven surface .
In 1982 , the finishing post was moved from Constitution Hill to Westminster Bridge due to construction works .
It remained there for twelve years before moving to its present location at The Mall .
In 2005 , the route around the Isle of Dogs between was switched from a clockwise to an anti - clockwise direction , and at the route was diverted to avoid St Katherine Docks and the cobblestoned area near the Tower of London .
In 2008 , a suspected gas leak at a pub in Wapping diverted the course , but in 2009 the race followed the same path as in 2007 .
