CEPHALIC VEIN
In human anatomy , the cephalic vein is a superficial vein in the arm .
It communicates with the basilic vein via the median cubital vein at the elbow and is located in the superficial fascia along the anterolateral surface of the biceps brachii muscle .
Near the shoulder , the cephalic vein passes between the deltoid and pectoralis major muscles ( deltopectoral groove ) and through the deltopectoral triangle , where it empties into the axillary vein .
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Section::::Clinical significance .
The cephalic vein is often visible through the skin , and its location in the deltopectoral groove is fairly consistent , making this site a good candidate for venous access .
Permanent pacemaker leads are often placed in the cephalic vein in the deltopectoral groove .
The vein may be used for intravenous access , as large bore cannula may be easily placed .
However , the cannulation of a vein as close to the radial nerve as the cephalic vein can sometimes lead to nerve damage .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Ordinarily the term cephalic refers to anatomy of the head .
When Persian physician Ibn Sīnā 's Canon was translated into medieval Latin , cephalic was mistakenly chosen to render the Arabic term al - kífal , meaning " outer " .
