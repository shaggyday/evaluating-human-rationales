TOAST ( HONOR )
A toast is a ritual in which a drink is taken as an expression of honor or goodwill .
The term may be applied to the person or thing so honored , the drink taken , or the verbal expression accompanying the drink .
Thus , a person could be " the toast of the evening " , for whom someone " proposes a toast " to congratulate and for whom a third person " toasts " in agreement .
The ritual forms the basis of the literary and performance genre , of which Mark Twain 's " To the Babies " is a well - known example .
The toast as described here is rooted in Western culture , but certain cultures outside that sphere have their own traditions in which consuming a drink is connected with ideas of celebration and honor .
While the physical and verbal ritual of the toast may be elaborate and formal , merely raising one 's glass towards someone or something and then drinking is essentially a toast as well , the message being one of goodwill towards the person or thing indicated .
HISTORY Section::::History .
According to various apocryphal stories , the custom of touching glasses evolved from concerns about poisoning .
By one account , clinking glasses together would cause each drink to spill over into the others ' ( though there is no real evidence for such an origin ) .
According to other stories , the word toast became associated with the custom in the 17th century , based on a custom of flavoring drinks with spiced toast .
The word originally referred to the lady in whose honor the drink was proposed , her name being seen as figuratively flavoring the drink .
The International Handbook on Alcohol and Culture says toasting " is probably a secular vestige of ancient sacrificial libations in which a sacred liquid was offered to the gods : blood or wine in exchange for a wish , a prayer summarized in the words ' long life ! '
or ' to your health !
SITUATIONS Section::::Situations .
Toasts are generally offered at times of celebration or commemoration , including certain holidays , such as New Year 's Eve .
Other occasions include retirement celebrations , housewarming parties , births , etc .
The protocol for toasting at weddings is comparatively elaborate and fixed .
At a wedding reception , the father of the bride , in his role as host , regularly offers the first toast , thanking the guests for attending , offering tasteful remembrances of the bride 's childhood , and wishing the newlyweds a happy life together .
The best man usually proposes a toast in the form of best wishes and congratulations to the newlyweds .
A best man 's toast takes the form of a short speech ( 3–5 minutes ) that combines a mixture of humor and sincerity .
The humor often comes in the shape of the best man telling jokes at the groom 's expense whilst the sincerity incorporates the praise and complimentary comments that a best man should make about the bride and groom , amongst others .
The actual " toast " is then delivered at the end of the speech and is a short phrase wishing the newlyweds a happy , healthy , loving life together .
The maid of honor may follow suit , appropriately tailoring her comments to the bride .
The groom may offer the final toast , thanking the bride 's parents for hosting the wedding , the wedding party for their participation , and finally dedicating the toast to the bridesmaids .
Typical traditional wedding toasts include the following : Toasts are also offered on patriotic occasions , as in the case of Stephen Decatur 's famous " Our country !
In our intercourse with foreign nations may we always be in the right ; but our country , right or wrong .
" Equally traditional are satiric verses : NORMS AND ETIQUETTE OF TOASTING Section::::Norms and etiquette of toasting .
Toasts may be solemn , sentimental , humorous , bawdy , or insulting .
The practice of announcing one 's intention to make a toast and signalling for quiet by rapping on the wineglass , while common , is regarded by some authorities as rude .
Except in very small and informal gatherings , a toast is offered standing .
At a gathering , none should offer a toast to the guest of honor until the host has had the opportunity to do so .
In English - speaking countries , guests may signal their approval of the toast by saying " hear hear " .
The person honored should neither stand nor drink , but after the toast should rise to thank the one who has offered the toast and take a drink , perhaps but not necessarily offering a toast in turn .
As toasts may occur in long series , experienced attendees often make sure to leave enough wine in the glass to allow participation in numerous toasts .
Putting one 's glass down before the toast is complete , or simply holding one 's glass without drinking is widely regarded as impolite , suggesting that one does not share the benevolent sentiments expressed in the toast , nor the unity and fellowship implicit in toasting itself .
Even the non - drinker is counseled not to refuse to allow wine to be poured for a toast .
Inverting the glass is especially discouraged .
Toasting traditionally involves alcoholic beverages .
Champagne ( or at least some variety of sparkling wine ) is regarded as especially festive and is widely associated with New Year 's Eve and other celebrations .
Many people nowadays substitute sparkling fruit juice ( often packaged in champagne - style bottles ) , and many authorities consider it perfectly acceptable to participate in a toast while drinking water .
Toasting with an empty glass may be viewed by some as acceptable behavior for the non - drinker , though feigning to drink from such a glass would likely be seen as ridiculous .
The person giving the toast should never do so with an empty glass , even if the glass contains nothing more than water .
Teetotalers may view the drinking of toasts to be abominable and incompatible with their stand , as witnessed by this narrative from The Teetotaler ( 1840 ) :
At the anniversary of Cheshunt College , Sir Culling Eardley Smith was in the chair .
This gentleman , after dinner , said " he had subscribed to the Teetotal Pledge , which of course was incompatible with the drinking of toasts ; " when the Rev. J. Blackburn , ( minister of Claremont Chapel , Pentonville , ) said " he was not a teetotaler,—he was not in bondage,—and on that subject he had very recently been preaching . "
What could the Rev. Gentleman mean by this , but that he had recently been preaching against Teetotalism ?
Let the Rev. Gentleman look at drinking customs and their enormous evils , and ask himself if he has done his duty ; or whether he expects to be pronounced " a good an faithful servant " , if he continues even from the pulpit to encourage the great damning evil of this nation .
Mr. Donaldson said that he was happy to add , that one of the most popular ministers of the day , the Rev. J. Sherman , gave Mr. B. a pretty severe and well - merited reply , by saying , " His brother Blackburn had said , he ( Mr. B. ) was not in bondage ; he must be allowed to say , that he rejoiced that he ( Mr. S. ) had been enabled to break through the old and stupid custom of washing down sentiments by draughts of intoxicating liquors .
He had thus become a free man .
Mr. Donaldson concluded with some very severe animadversions upon the infamous conduct of Mr. Blackburn .
It is a superstition in the United States Navy that a toast is never to be made with water , since the person so honored will be doomed to a watery grave .
During a United States Air Force Dining In , all toasts are traditionally made with wine except for the final toast of the night made in honor of POWs / MIAs ; because these honorees did not have the luxury of wine while in captivity , the toast is made with water .
Some versions of the protocol prescribe a toast in water for all deceased comrades .
It is or was the custom on the ( British ) Royal Navy to drink toasts sitting , because in old - type wooden warships below decks there was not enough headroom to stand upright .
THE GERMAN WORD " PROST " PROSIT / PROST Section::::The German word " prost " .
Section::::Prosit / Prost .
Prosit is a Latin word from which the German short form " prost " is derived .
It is a toast , that is an acclamation made before drinking an alcoholic beverage when drinkers chink glasses .
The expression dates back to the beginning of the 18th century when it was used among university students and eventually made its way into every day language .
In a ceremonious context and in connection with a short speech , the English word toast may also be used .
ORIGIN OF THE WORD Section::::Origin of the word .
The word is , as mentioned above , of Latin origin and it comes from the verb " prodesse " (= " to benefit sth / sb " , " to be beneficial " ) .
Consequently , " prosit " is the conjugated form ( 3rd person Singular , Present Subjunctive , Active ) and therefore an optative : " To you/ to your health " .
Like the colloquial " prost " , " prosit " was originally used by university students .
USAGE Section::::Usage .
In German , synonyms like " Wohl bekomm 's ! " , " Zum Wohl ! " , and many versions from other languages may also be used instead of " prosit " .
The acclamation itself is also referred to as a " prosit " .
The verb form is " zuprosten " , where the prefix " zu " means that the speech act is targeted at one or several people .
In the Swabian dialect , the word has the further meaning of a belch , called a " Prositle " .
The acclamation is followed by the clinking of glasses , often linked to other rules like making eye contact .
This ritual is commonly attributed to a medieval custom , whereby one could avoid being poisoned by one 's drinking companions , as a few drops of each beverage got mixed when clinking glasses .
There is every likelihood that this did not work .
It was much more effective for one table to share one or more drinking vessels , a procedure which was common for a long time .
In Danish , Swedish , and Norwegian , prosit is a blessing used in response to a sneeze , in the same way the English expression " bless you " is used .
In Germany , toasting , not necessarily by words but usually just by touching each other 's drinking vessels , is usually a very closely observed part of culture .
In private company , no one should drink a sip of alcohol before having toasted all the other people at the table .
In doing this , it is very important to look directly into the other drinker 's eyes .
Not practising this is considered rude and often , humorously , believed to attract all kinds of bad luck ( e.g. " seven years of bad luck " and the like ) .
TRADITIONAL TOASTS Section::::Traditional toasts .
In the British Royal Navy , the officers ' noon mess typically began with the loyal toast , followed by a toast distinctive for the day of the week :
* Monday : Our ships at sea .
* Tuesday : Our sailors ( formerly Our men but changed to include women ) .
* Wednesday : Ourselves .
( " As no - one else is likely to concern themselves with our welfare " is often the retort and not part of the toast )
* Thursday : A bloody war or a sickly season ( meaning the desire and likelihood of being promoted when many people die : during war or sickness . )
* Friday : A willing foe and sea room .
( meaning the payment of prize money after a successful engagement )
* Saturday : Our families ( formerly Our wives and sweethearts with the retort of " may they never meet " ) .
* Sunday : Absent friends .
The sequence was also prescribed in at least one publication for the United States Navy .
A toast might be spontaneous and free - form , a carefully planned original speech , or a recitation of traditional sentiments such as this Irish example :
An informal variation of the last 2 lines is : TOASTS WORLDWIDE
Section::::Toasts Worldwide .
In various cultures worldwide , toasting is common and to not do so may be a breach of etiquette .
The general theme of a toast is " good luck " or " good health " .
At formal meals in certain countries of the Commonwealth of Nations , the first toast to be proposed is traditionally the Loyal Toast ( " The Queen " ) .
This may be adapted in other countries to give a loyal toast to the appropriate Head of State .
