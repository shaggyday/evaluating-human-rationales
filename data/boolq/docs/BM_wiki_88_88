Smokey and the Bandit was the second highest - grossing domestic film of 1977 .
PLOT Section::::Plot .
Wealthy Texan Big Enos Burdette and his son Little Enos seek a trucker willing to bootleg Coors beer to Georgia for their refreshment ; Big Enos has sponsored a racer in Atlanta 's Southern Classic and wants to celebrate in style when he wins .
They find local legend Bo " Bandit " Darville at a roadeo at Lakewood Fairgrounds in Atlanta and offer him $ 80,000 to pick up 400 cases of Coors from Texarkana ( the closest place it could be legally sold at that time ) , and bring it back to Atlanta in 28 hours .
Bandit takes the bet and recruits his partner Cledus " Snowman " Snow to drive the truck , while Bandit drives a black Pontiac Trans Am bought on an advance from the Burdettes as a " blocker " to divert attention away from the truck and its illegal cargo .
They arrive in Texarkana an hour ahead of schedule , load the truck and head back toward Atlanta .
Immediately upon starting the second leg of the run , Bandit is stopped by a runaway bride named Carrie who hitches a ride with him , but in so doing Bandit becomes a target of Sheriff Buford T. Justice , a career Texas lawman whose son Junior was to have been Carrie 's bridegroom .
Ignoring his own jurisdiction , Sheriff Justice , with dimwitted Junior in tow , pursues Bandit all the way to Georgia to get Carrie back , even as various mishaps cause his cruiser to disintegrate around them .
Bandit 's antics attract more attention from police throughout Dixie while Snowman barrels on toward Atlanta with the contraband beer , but they are helped along the way by many colorful characters via CB radio .
Neither Sheriff Justice nor any other officials know of Snowman 's illegal manifest , while Bandit is likewise unaware that Sheriff Justice is pursuing him because of Carrie .
The chase begins to intensify when , moments after crossing back into Georgia , Snowman is narrowly rescued by Bandit after being stopped by a motorcycle patrolman , and state and local police escalate their pursuit of Bandit with more cruisers , larger roadblocks , and even a police helicopter to track his movements .
Discouraged by the unexpected mounting attention , and with just four miles left to go , Bandit is about to give up , but Snowman refuses to listen and takes the lead , smashing through the roadblock at the fairgrounds ' main entrance .
They make it back during the race with only ten minutes to spare , but instead of taking the payoff , Carrie and Bandit accept a ' double - or - nothing ' offer from Little Enos : a challenge to run up to Boston and bring back clam chowder in 18 hours .
They quickly escape in one of Big Enos ' thirteen Cadillacs as the police flood the racetrack .
They pass Sheriff Justice 's badly damaged police car by the side of the road .
Over the radio , Bandit first directs Justice to Big and Little Enos , but then , in a gesture of respect , reveals his true location and invites Justice to give chase , leaving Junior behind .

# 3 PRODUCTION Section::::Production .
Director Hal Needham originally planned the film as a low - budget B movie with a production cost of $ 1 million , with Jerry Reed as the Bandit .
It was not until Needham 's friend Burt Reynolds read the script , and said he would star , that the film was aimed at a more mainstream release ; Reed would now portray Bandit 's friend Snowman ( Reed would eventually play the Bandit in Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 ) .
At that time Reynolds was the top box office star in the world .
In the original script Carrie was called Kate while Big Enos and Little Enos were called Kyle and Dickey .
Bandit 's car was a second generation Ford Mustang and the prize for completing the run was a new truck rather than $ 80,000 .
Burt Reynolds revealed in his autobiography that Needham had written the first draft script on legal pads .
Upon showing it to his friend , Reynolds told Needham that it was the worst script he had ever read but that he would still make the movie .
Most of the dialogue was improvised on set .
Universal Studios bankrolled Smokey and the Bandit for $ 5.3 million , figuring it was a good risk .
Just two days before production was to begin , Universal sent a " hatchet man " to Atlanta to inform Needham that the budget was being trimmed by $ 1 million .
With Reynolds ' salary at $ 1 million , Needham was left with only $ 3.3 million to make the film .
Needham and assistant director David Hamburger spent 30 hours revising the shooting schedule .
" Buford T. Justice " was the name of a real Florida Highway Patrolman known to Reynolds ' father , who was once Police Chief of Riviera Beach , Florida .
His father was also the inspiration for the word " sumbitch " used in the film , a variation of the phrase " son - of - a - bitch " that , according to Reynolds , he uttered quite often .
Jackie Gleason was given free rein to ad - lib dialogue and make suggestions .
It was his idea to have Junior alongside him throughout .
In particular , the scene where Sheriff Justice unknowingly encounters the Bandit in the " choke and puke " ( a roadside diner ) was not in the original story , but rather was Gleason 's idea .
Before Gleason was cast in the film , Richard Boone was originally considered for the role of Buford T. Justice .
Sally Field only accepted the part after her agent advised her that she needed a big movie role on her resume .
Reynolds actively pushed for her casting after Universal initially resisted , claiming Field was not attractive enough .
Field enjoyed making the film , but remembers that virtually the entire project was improvised .
Reportedly , Needham had great difficulty getting any studios or producers to take his project seriously , as in the film industry , he was better known as a stuntman .
He managed to obtain studio attention after his friend Reynolds agreed to portray the Bandit in the film .
The movie was primarily filmed in Georgia in the cities of McDonough , Jonesboro and Lithonia .
The scenes set in Texarkana were filmed in Jonesboro and the surrounding area , and many of the chase scenes were filmed in the surrounding areas on Highway 54 between Fayetteville and Jonesboro for a majority of the driving scenes , Mundy 's Mill Road , Main Street in Jonesboro , Georgia State Route 400 , I-85 ( Pleasant Hill exit ) , and in McDonough .
However , the scene where they drive through the Shell gas station was filmed in Ojai , California on the corner of Ojai and El Paseo .
Much of the surrounding scene comes from that immediate vicinity .
The scene featuring the racetrack was filmed at Lakewood Speedway at the old Lakewood Fairgrounds on the south side of Atlanta .
The roller coaster seen in the movie was the Greyhound .
It had not been used for some time and was repainted for the film .
It was destroyed in Smokey and the Bandit II and a flashback scene in Part 3 .
The film 's theme song , " East Bound and Down " , was written virtually overnight by Jerry Reed .
He gave Needham a preview of the song , and when initially he got no reaction from the director , offered to rewrite the song .
Needham , however , liked the song so much he assured Jerry not to change a word .
It became one of Reed 's biggest hits and his signature song .
The area around Helen , Georgia was also used for some locations .
The scene where Buford T. Justice 's car has the door knocked off by a passing semi truck was shot on Georgia State Route 75 , north of Helen .
The tow truck driver was a local garage owner , Berlin Wike .
The film features the custom clothing and costuming of Niver Western Wear of Fort Worth , Texas .
Niver provided much of the western attire worn in the film , as well as the custom - made sheriff 's uniforms ( waist size 64 inches ) that Jackie Gleason wore throughout the film .
Reynolds and Sally Field began dating during the filming of Smokey and the Bandit .
While made to take advantage of the ongoing 1970s CB radio fad , the film added to the craze .
Though the film Moonrunners ( 1975 ) is the precursor to the television series
The Dukes of Hazzard ( 1979 - 1985 ) , from the same creator and with many identical settings and concepts , the popularity of Smokey and the Bandit and similar films helped get the Dukes series on the air .
Three actors from the main cast of The Dukes of Hazzard appear in small uncredited roles in Smokey and the Bandit : Ben Jones , John Schneider and Sonny Shroyer ( who played a police officer in both ) .
In return , Reynolds portrayed the Dukes character Boss Hogg ( originally portrayed by Sorrell Booke ) in the film adaptation
The Dukes of Hazzard ( 2005 ) .
Reynolds is also referenced by name in several early episodes of the series .
VEHICLES Section::::Vehicles .
Needham saw an advertisement for the soon - to - be - released 1977 Pontiac Trans Am and knew right away that would be the Bandit 's car , or , as Needham referred to it , a character in the movie .
He contacted Pontiac and an agreement was made that four 1977 Trans Ams and two Pontiac LeMans 4-door sedans would be provided for the movie .
The Trans Ams were actually 1976-model cars with 1977 front ends .
( From 1970 to 1976 , both the Firebird / Trans Am and Chevrolet Camaro had two round headlights , and in 1977 , the Firebird / Trans Am was changed to four rectangular headlights , while the Camaro remained unchanged . )
The decals were also changed to 1977-style units , as evidenced by the engine size callouts on the hood scoop being in liters rather than cubic inches , as had been the case in 1976 .
The hood scoop on these cars says " 6.6 LITRE " , which in 1977 would have denoted an Oldsmobile 403-equipped car or a non W-72 , 180 hp version of the 400 Pontiac engine .
All four of the cars were badly damaged during production , one of which was all but destroyed during the jump over the dismantled bridge .
The Trans Am used for the dismantled bridge jump was equipped with a booster rocket , the same type that was used by Evel Knievel during his failed Snake River Canyon jump .
Needham served as the driver for the stunt ( standing in for Reynolds ) while Lada St. Edmund was in the same car ( standing in for Sally Field during the jump ) .
By the movie 's ending , the final surviving Trans Am and LeMans were both barely running and the other cars had become parts donors to keep them running .
The Burdettes ' car is a 1974 Cadillac Eldorado convertible painted in a " Candy Red " color scheme , and is seen briefly at the beginning of the movie and as Bandit , Snowman , Fred , and Frog make their escape in the final scene .
The film also made use of three Kenworth W900A short - frame semi trucks , which Jerry Reed can be seen driving , each equipped with 38-inch sleepers .
Two units were 1974 models as evidenced by standard silver Kenworth emblems on the truck grille , and one unit was a 1973 model as evidenced by the gold - painted Kenworth emblem on the truck 's grille signifying Kenworth 's 50 years in business .
The paint code for each truck was coffee brown with gold trims , and the mural trailer used was manufactured by Hobbs Trailers in Texas with a non - operational Thermo King Refrigeration unit .
This is obvious , because there is no fuel tank on the underside of the trailer to power the refrigeration unit , and the unit is never heard running .
LEGAL STATUS OF COORS BEER Section::::Legal status of Coors beer .
In 1977 , Coors was unavailable for sale east of Oklahoma .
A 1974 Time magazine article explains why Coors was so coveted that one would be willing to pay the Bandit such a high price to transport it .
Coors Banquet Beer had a brief renaissance as certain people sought it out for its lack of stabilizers and preservatives .
The article says that future Vice President Gerald Ford hid it in his luggage after a trip to Colorado in order to take it back to Washington .
President Dwight D. Eisenhower had a steady supply airlifted to Washington by the Air Force .
The article also mentions Frederick Amon , who smuggled it from Colorado to North Carolina and sold it for four times the retail price .
The lack of additives and preservatives meant that Coors had the potential for spoiling in a week if it were not kept cold throughout its transportation and in storage at its destination .
This explains the 28-hour deadline .
SOUNDTRACK Section::::Soundtrack .
The theme music , " East Bound and Down " , was sung and co - written by Reed ( credited under his birth name , Jerry Hubbard ) and Dick Feller .
It became Reed 's signature song and is found on multiple albums , including Country Legends and his live album Jerry Reed :
Live Still .
In 1991 it was arranged for orchestra by Crafton Beck and recorded by Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra for their album Down on the Farm .
Several other groups , such as US rock band Tonic , have also covered it .
Reed also penned and performed the song for the opening credits , entitled " The Legend " , which tells of some of The Bandit 's escapades prior to the events of the film , and the ballad " The Bandit " , which features in several versions in the movie and on the soundtrack .
Reed 's hit notwithstanding
, Bill Justis is the first name on the credits for the soundtrack as he composed and arranged original music throughout the film .
Musicians such as Beegie Adair and George Tidwell played on the soundtrack as part of long careers in music .
Legendary five - string banjo player Bobby Thompson is also heard prominently towards the end of " East Bound and Down .
" The soundtrack album was released in 1977 on vinyl , cassette and 8-track through MCA Records .
TRACK LISTING
RECEPTION BOX OFFICE Section::::Reception .
Section::::Box office .
Smokey and the Bandit was a sleeper hit .
The film premiered at Radio City Music Hall in New York City where it performed badly .
It then opened in just the South of the United States over the Memorial Day weekend and grossed $ 2,689,851 in 386 theatres .
By the end of June it had played in major Southern markets including Charlotte , Atlanta , Jacksonville , New Orleans , Memphis , Dallas and Oklahoma City grossing $ 11.9 million .
It opened in other Northern states at the end of July .

The worldwide gross is estimated at over $ 300 million .
Burt Reynolds rated the film as the one he most enjoyed and had the most fun making in his career .
CRITICAL RESPONSE
Section::::Critical response .
Film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film a good rating ( 3 stars out of a possible 4 ) and characterized it as " About as subtle as The Three Stooges , but a classic compared to the sequels and countless rip - offs which followed . "
Gene Siskel , in his review in the Chicago Tribune , gave the film two stars and complained that the film failed to tell the audience when the clock started on the beer run , thus removing suspense throughout the film concerning how long remained to them .
He also claimed that Bandit is never made aware of Frog 's leaving Junior at the altar , which is why the Bandit continually asks why a Texas sheriff is chasing him .
However , this is inaccurate : within seconds of Bandit picking her up , Frog tells him " there is a wedding in search of a bride " , and goes on to explain her ill - advised romance with Junior , as Bandit holds up the CB mic for Snowman to hear .
The film 's editors , Walter Hannemann and Angelo Ross , were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing .
On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes it has a 79 % rating based on 29 reviews .
Alfred Hitchcock stated that the film was one of his favorites .
Upon meeting Burt Reynolds , Billy Bob Thornton told him that the picture was not considered a " film " in the south , so much as a documentary .
Smokey and the Bandit was released in the United Kingdom on August 28 , 1977 and was a sizeable success there , garnering positive reviews .

Section::::Trans Am .
After the debut of the film the Trans Am became wildly popular with sales almost doubling in two years of the film 's release , to the delight of General Motors ; in fact , it outsold its Chevrolet Camaro counterpart for the first time ever .
Reynolds was given the 1977 vehicle used during promotion of the film as a gift , though the car itself never actually appeared in the film .
Because of the popularity of the movie and the sales success of the Trans Am , then President of Pontiac Alex Mair promised to supply Reynolds with a Trans Am each year .
Owing to his financial difficulties , in 2014 Reynolds put his vast collection of artwork and memorabilia up for auction , including the Trans Am .
High estimates for the car were up to $ 80,000 , but that was dwarfed by the actual sale price of $ 450,000 .
Also up for auction was a go - kart replica of the car , which sold for nearly $ 14,000 .
In 2016 , Trans Am Depot , a Florida - based automobile customization company , announced that it would build 77 Trans Ams that would be modeled after the car that Reynolds drove in the 1977 original .
Pontiac was discontinued by GM in 2009 and Trans Am Depot has permission to use the Trans Am name .
These new models were built off the Camaro platform ( the very same one that the real Firebird and Trans Am used ) , came with Pontiac arrowhead , flaming bird and Bandit logos , as well as instrument panels , center consoles and hood scoops emulating their 1977 counterparts , and were signed by Reynolds .
Some differences included the use of a supercharged 454-cid ( 7.4-liter ) Chevrolet - sourced engine that put out 840 HP , and four round headlights , which appeared on the 1967 - 69 Firebirds / Trans Ams only ; the actual 1977 - 81 models had rectangular headlights .
DIABLO SANDWICH Section::::Diablo sandwich .
The diablo sandwich ordered by Sheriff Justice in the Arkansas barbecue restaurant scene has entered popular culture as a minor reference to the film .
While no authoritative source identifies the composition of the sandwich , there are several possibilities .
A segment of the CMT program Reel Eats used a sloppy joe - style recipe consisting of seasoned ground beef , corn and sour cream .
Another proposal , based more closely on images from the film and the shooting location of the scene ( at an Old Hickory House restaurant in Georgia ) , is pulled pork and hot sauce on a hamburger bun .
THE BANDIT RUN Section::::The Bandit Run .
First run in 2007 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the movie , The Bandit Run was the brainchild of Dave Hall , owner of Restore A Muscle Car .
A group of Trans Am owners and fans of the movie take part in an annual road trip from Texarkana to Jonesboro , Georgia , recreating the route taken by the characters in the film .
The Bandit Run quickly caught on and has become a fixture , most recently celebrating the 40th anniversary of the movie with a special screening of the film attended by Burt Reynolds and a recreation of the jump undertaken by Bandit and Frog across a river .
MOBIL 1 COMMERCIAL Section::::Mobil 1 commercial .
In 2014 , petroleum company Mobil 1 produced television commercials , featuring NASCAR star Tony Stewart , closely based on the film .
Called Smoke is the Bandit playing on Stewart 's nickname , the commercials featured him as the Bandit opposite Darrell Waltrip who played Snowman and Jeff Hammond as Buford T. Justice .
The story replaced the Coors beer with Mobil 1 products .
The adverts poked fun at the film and even featured a Pontiac Trans Am and a cover version of the song East Bound and Down .
The commercials were produced after Stewart mentioned that the movie was one of his favorites .
TELEVISION CENSORSHIP AND ALTERNATIVE
VERSIONS Section::::Television censorship and alternative versions .
When Smokey and the Bandit first aired on American network television in the early 1980s , censors were faced with the challenge of toning down the raw language of the original film .
For this purpose , they overdubbed dialogue deemed offensive , which was ( and remains , to an extent ) common practice .
The most noted change made for network broadcast was the replacing of Buford 's often - spoken phrase " sumbitch " ( a contraction of " son of a bitch " ; usually in reference to the Bandit ) with the phrase " scum bum " .
This phrase achieved a level of popularity with children , and the 2007 Hot Wheels release of the 1970s Firebird Trans Am has " scum bum " emblazoned on its tail .
The TV prints of the first two Bandit films are still shown regularly on television , although a few TV stations aired the unedited version in recent years as some of the phraseology ( i.e. " ( son of a ) bitch " , " ass " , etc . ) became more acceptable on TV .
The original actors mostly redubbed their own lines for the television version , except for Gleason .
Actor Henry Corden , who voiced Fred Flintstone after original performer Alan Reed died , was used to replace a considerable amount of Sheriff Justice 's dialogue .
In the UK , the heavily dubbed version was shown for a number of years , particularly by the BBC .
However , in more recent years , the original version has been shown ( on ITV , a commercial channel ) , usually with the stronger language edited out , often quite awkwardly and noticeably .
The theatrical release itself had a few lines deleted , including a creative edit in which Sheriff Justice tells a state trooper to " fuck off . "
His expletive is obscured when a passing big rig sounds its horn .
At the time , using the ' F ' word would immediately require an R rating and this clever self - censorship allowed the film to avoid this rating and reach a much larger audience .
However , the scene and the obscured expletive was played for comedy value and written as such , with the passing truck being the gag of the scene more than a way to avoid the censors .
In 2006 , a DVD re - release was issued of Smokey and the Bandit featuring a digitally - remastered audio track with 5.1 Dolby - compatible surround sound .
It should be noted however that many of the film 's original sounds were replaced .
For instance , the diesel engine start and run up sequence in the opening sequence of the film was completely dubbed over with a totally new sound .
A few other examples of " sound effect replacement " occur when Bandit takes off after managing to get a reluctant Cledus involved in the bet , and after he comes to a screeching halt on a roadway moments before picking up Carrie .
Some of the original sound effects ( such as Cledus ' dog Fred 's barking ) and music ( such as the final chase to the Southern Classic ) were removed and not replaced .
( Note : earlier DVD releases and the 40th Anniversary Blu - ray of the film have the original soundtrack intact . )
Major portions of the audio ' background ' have been modified with different engine sounds or tire squeals from the original film .
The updated version of the film features sounds inaccurate for what would be produced by the Trans Am or the numerous other Pontiac vehicles in the film .
The original film had correct sounds that were usually recorded live as the action took place .
SPIN - OFF TELEVISION FILMS Section::::Spin - off television films .
A series of four made - for - TV spin - off films ( Bandit Goes Country , Bandit Bandit , Beauty and the Bandit and Bandit 's Silver Angel ) were produced in 1994 for Universal Television 's Action Pack with actor Brian Bloom playing a younger version of Bandit .
The three original films introduced two generations of the Pontiac Trans Am , and the Dodge Stealth in the television movies .
