The season was well received amongst critics , especially in regards to the episodes with Kevin Smith and the storylines on oral sex and the school shooting .
The Palm Beach Post said the series " is told from a teenager 's point of view since the writers have no interest in appealing to a broad - based demographic like the writers on , say , Fox 's The O.C. ...
it connects with teens on their level " , though it was still " surprised Jay used the graphic oral sex term you 'd hear in just about every high school hallway in America " , that word being " blow - job " .
The Boston Herald said " it is important for teens to learn about sexually transmitted diseases and the cost of unprotected sex ... and should help parents begin conversations with their own children " .
PopMatters 's Jodie Janella Horn described Degrassi : The Next Generation as " the most unnervingly accurate series ever of the high school genre " .
Another comparison was made between Degrassi : The Next Generation and The O.C. , saying " The O.C. will never remind me of anything in my life " , while the events in the two - part episode " Voices Carry " with " hotel room trashing , projectile launching , fist fighting at weddings bi - polar loon Craig [ and girlfriend Ashley ] , was like an actual scene from my actual teenage life and just like me , Ashley thinks they 're going to pull through it together " .
AfterElton.com , a website that focuses on the portrayal of gay and bisexual men in the media praised the series for " not only focusing on gay teens , but it showcases gay sex , and relationships .
By not stereotyping [ the gay characters ] they are helping thousands of confused and shameful teenagers feel accepted , in Canada and America alike . "

The Next Generation " tha Best Teen TV N da WRLD ! "
( the best teen TV in the world ) in a six - page article in The New York Times .
Commenting that " the explosive - issue - per - capita ratio is seriously out of whack " , he admitted that " the teen - diary attention to microissues ( zits , periods , parents ' night ) gives the episodes a peculiar authenticity no matter how outrageous their story lines " .
Two episodes were nominated for " Best Youth Script " at the Canadian Screenwriting Awards , which are administered by the Writers Guild of Canada .
Shelley Scarrow 's " Secrets Part One " lost out to " Mercy Street " , written by James Hurst and Miklos Perlus .
