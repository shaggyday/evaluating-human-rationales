NORWAY – EUROPEAN UNION RELATIONS
The Kingdom of Norway is not a member state of the European Union ( EU ) .
It is associated with the Union through its membership in agreements in the European Economic Area ( EEA ) established in 1994 , and by virtue of being a founding member of the European Free Trade Association ( EFTA ) which was founded in 1960 , one of the historically two dominant western European trade blocs .
Norway had twice considered joining the European Community and the European Union , but opted to decline following referenda in 1972 and 1994 .
TRADE Section::::Trade .
Norway 's trade is dominated by the EU , and Norway is the EU 's fifth most important import partner .
Norway to EU trade amounted to € 91.85 billion in 2008 , primarily energy supplies ( only 14.1 % is manufactured products ) .
The EU 's exports to Norway amounted to € 43.58 billion , primarily manufactured products .
EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA Section::::European Economic Area .
The EEA agreement grants Norway access to the EU 's single market .
From the 23,000 EU laws currently in force , the EEA has incorporated around 5,000 ( in force ) meaning that Norway is subject to roughly 21 % of EU laws .
According to Norway 's Foreign Affairs ( NOU 2012:2 p. 790 , 795 ) , from the legislative acts implemented from 1994 to 2010 , 70 % of EU directives and 17 % of EU regulations in force in the EU in 2008 were in force in Norway in 2010 .
Overall , this means that about 28 % of EU legislation in force of these two types in 2008 were in force in Norway in 2010 .
While the Norwegian parliament has to approve all new legislation which has " significant new obligations " , this has been widely supported and usually uncontested ; between 1992 and 2011 , 92 % of EU laws were approved unanimously , and most of the rest by a broad majority .
This arrangement facilitates free movement of goods , capital , services and people between the EU and EFTA members including Norway .
Free movement of goods means freedom from customs fees , where however food and beverage is excluded ( because those are subsidised by the EU ) .
Fishing and agriculture incur over 100 million euros of tariffs annually due to customs fees .
Joining the European Union as a full member would eliminate these fees and lead to lower food prices in Norway .
This is opposed by farmers and the fishing industry as it would create additional competition for domestic producers .
Free movement of people means freedom of movement for workers between Norway and EU , and that Norway is a part of the Schengen Area .
Norway has been granted participation rights ( save voting rights ) in several of the Union 's programmes , bodies and initiatives .
These include security and defence areas like the European Defence Agency , the Nordic Battle Group , Frontex , Europol and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction .
Whether or not the country should apply for full membership has been one of the most dominant and divisive issues in modern Norwegian political debate .
Norway 's total financial contribution linked to the EEA agreement consists of contributions related to the participation in these projects , and part made available to development projects for reducing social and economic disparities in the EU ( EEA and Norway Grants ) .
EEA EFTA states fund their participation in programmes and agencies by an amount corresponding to the relative size of their gross domestic product ( GDP ) compared to the GDP of the whole EEA .
The EEA EFTA participation is hence on an equal footing with EU member states .
The total EEA EFTA commitment amounts to 2.4 % of the overall EU programme budget .
In 2008 Norway 's contribution was € 188 million .
Throughout the programme period 2007–2013 , the Norwegian contribution will increase substantially in parallel with the development of the EU programme budget , from € 130 million in 2007 to € 290 million in 2013 .
For the EEA and Norway Grants from 2004 to 2009 , Norway provided almost € 1.3 billion .
HISTORY Section::::History .
In 1962 , Norway applied for membership in the European Economic Community ( EEC ) with Ireland , Britain and Denmark having applied to join the previous July and August respectively .
When France rebuffed Britain 's application the following year , accession negotiations with Norway and the other countries were also suspended , because of strong economic ties between them .
This happened again in 1967 .
Norway completed its negotiations for the terms to govern a Norwegian membership in the EEC on 22 January 1972 .
Following an overwhelming parliamentary majority in favour of joining the EEC in early 1972 , the government decided to put the question to a popular referendum , scheduled for September 24 and 25 .
The result was that 53.5 % voted against membership and 46.5 % for it .
The Norwegian Labour Party government led by Trygve Bratteli resigned over the outcome of the referendum , and a coalition government led by Lars Korvald took over .
Norway entered into a trade agreement with the Community following the outcome of the referendum .
That trade agreement remained in force until Norway joined the European Economic Area on 1 January 1994 .
On 28 November 1994 , a second referendum was held , narrowing the margin but yielding the same result : 52.2 % opposed membership and 47.8 % in favour , with a turn - out of 88.6 % .
There are currently no plans to file another application .
Norway was an associate member of the Western European Union until the organisation terminated in 2011 .
MEMBERSHIP DEBATE Section::::Membership debate .
Norway 's application for EU membership has been frozen but not withdrawn .
It could be resumed at any time following renewed domestic political will , as happened in the case of Malta .
A major issue for Norway is its fishing resources , which are a significant part of the national economy and which would come under the Common Fisheries Policy if Norway were to accede to the EU .
Norway has high GNP per capita , and would have to pay a high membership fee .
The country has a limited amount of agriculture , and few underdeveloped areas , which means that Norway would receive little economic support from the EU .
However , , Norway has chosen to opt into many EU projects and since its total financial contribution linked to the EEA agreement consists of contributions related to the participation in these projects , and a part made available to development projects for reducing social and economic disparities in the EU ( EEA and Norway Grants ) , its participation is on an equal footing with that of EU member states .
The total EEA EFTA commitment amounts to 2.4 % of the overall EU programme budget .
Because these positions to a great extent cut across ideological boundaries , various political parties have dealt with the issue in different ways .
The Centre Party has maintained the most principled stand against membership , and though parties such as the Norwegian Conservative Party and the Norwegian Labour Party support membership in their platform , they allow for a minority to oppose it .
Most dramatically , the Norwegian Liberal Party split over the issue in 1972 at the famed party conference in Røros and did not reunite until 1989 .
The EU membership crosses the traditional left – right axis in Norwegian politics .
Since the Labour Party lost its dominance in Norwegian politics , all governments have been a coalition of several political parties .
Because the EU membership issue almost certainly would break up any conceivable government coalition ( except maybe a grand coalition of Labour and the Conservatives ) , no government has raised the subject and no opposition party has stated any desire to do so either .
Disagreements on this issue have been known to create divisiveness within families and local communities .
Although there is a general pattern that urban communities favour membership and rural communities do not , there have been vocal minorities in every area of Norway .
Complicating the matter has been that a great variety of political and emotional factors have been raised in the debate .
Radical socialists oppose membership because of an opposition to conservative economic and political forces that concern them within Europe ; opponents on the right are concerned about an infringement on Norwegian culture ; and others are opposed in principle to compromising Norwegian sovereignty .
NORWEGIAN POLITICAL PARTIES ' POSITIONS
Section::::Norwegian political parties ' positions .
Currently , parties supporting or opposing EU membership are to be found in both right - wing and left - wing coalitions : as a result , most governments contain pro- and anti - EU elements .
To avoid a new debate on EU , anti - EU parties usually require " suicide paragraphs " in government - coalition agreements , meaning that if some party in the coalition officially begins a new debate on EU , the government will fall .
This has been true for both the previous centre - right Bondevik government and the centre - left Stoltenberg government .
The following table shows the different parliamentary parties ' stance on EU - membership , sorted by their vote share in the latest parliamentary election ( 2017)Red Party Social dumping , undemocratic ; withdraw EEA .
OPINION POLLING Section::::Opinion polling .
On average , Norwegian voters are strongly opposed to Norwegian membership in the European Union .
In a December 2015 poll , 18 % were for , and 72 % were against .
According to a 2010 poll , the majority of the voters of every Norwegian party were against EU membership . !
