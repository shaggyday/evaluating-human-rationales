PLOT Section::::Plot .
Alice Kingsleigh has spent the past three years following in her father 's footsteps and sailing the high seas .
Upon her return to London from China , she learns her ex - fianc√© , Hamish Ascot , has taken over his father 's company and plans to have Alice sign over her father 's ship in exchange for her family home .
Alice follows a butterfly she recognizes as Absolem and returns to Wonderland through a mirror .
Alice is greeted by the White Queen , the White Rabbit , the Tweedles , the Dormouse , the March Hare , Bayard and the Cheshire Cat .
They inform her that the Mad Hatter , Tarrant Hightopp , is acting madder than usual because his family is missing .
Alice tries to console him , but the Mad Hatter remains sure of his family 's survival of the Attack of the Jabberwocky day .
Believing that finding the Hatter 's family is the only way to stop his deteriorating health , the White Queen sends Alice to consult Time himself and convince him to save the Hatter 's family in the past .
The Queen cautions Alice that history will be destroyed if anyone sees their past or future self .
Upon visiting Time 's palace , Alice finds the Chronosphere , an object that powers all time in Underland .
After being told by Time that altering the past is impossible , Alice steals the Chronosphere and travels back in time , shortly after finding the exiled Red Queen , Iracebeth of Crims , is in the care of Time .
The Red Queen urges Time to go after Alice .
Alice accidentally flies to the day of Iracebeth 's coronation , where a younger Tarrant begins a mockery of the Red Queen when the royal crown does not fit her abnormal head .
This causes Iracebeth to melt down .
Her father deems her inappropriate to rule and passes the title of queen to her younger sister Mirana , the White Queen .
Alice learns of an event in Iracebeth and Mirana 's past that caused friction between the two , and she travels back in time again , hoping it will change Iracebeth 's ways and cease the Jabberwocky from killing the Hatter 's family .
The young Mirana steals a tart from her mother and eats it .
When confronted by their mother , Mirana lies about eating the tart , and Iracebeth is accused , causing her to run out of the castle in sadness .
Alice sees her about to run into a clock , the event that deforms her head and personality .
She is able to get the clock out of the way , but fails to change the past as Iracebeth trips and slams her head anyway .
Alice is then confronted by a weakened Time , who scolds her for putting all of time in danger .
She runs into a nearby mirror back into the real world , where she wakes up in a mental hospital , diagnosed with female hysteria .
By the help of her mother , she returns to Underland , where she travels to the Attack of the Jabberwocky and discovers that the Hatter 's family never died , but were captured by Iracebeth .
Returning to the present , Alice discovers the Hatter at the brink of death .
After Alice tearfully says that she believes him , Tarrant awakens and reforms back to his normal self .
The Underlanders go to the Red Queen 's castle , where Tarrant finds his family shrunk and trapped in an ant farm .
Iracebeth apprehends them and steals the Chronosphere from Alice , taking Mirana back to the day she lied about the tart .
By the time Tarrant and Alice get there , Iracebeth and her past self see each other .
Time becomes irrelevant , and Underland begins to freeze .
Using the Chronosphere , Alice and the Hatter race back to the present , where Alice is able to place the Chronosphere back in its original place .
With the Chronosphere stabilized , Underland reverts to normal .
The Hatter reunites with his family .
Mirana apologizes to Iracebeth for lying , and both of them make amends .
Alice bids her friends farewell and returns to the real world where her mother refuses to return Alice 's ship over to Hamish , and the two set to travel the world together with their own company .

The film was announced via Variety in December 2012 .
Bobin was first approached about the project while doing post - production work on Muppets Most Wanted .
Of being asked , Bobin has said that " I just could n't pass it up " , as he has a passion for the works of Lewis Carroll as well as history in general .
In July 2013 , it was announced that Johnny Depp would return as the Hatter , with Mia Wasikowska 's return confirmed the following November .
In January 2014 Sacha Baron Cohen joined the cast to play Time .
In May 2014 , Rhys Ifans joined the cast to play Zanik Hightopp , the Mad Hatter 's father .
In developing the character of " Time " , Bobin sought to avoid creating a " straight - up bad guy " , noting that it would be " a bit dull " , and also that the role in that universe already existed in the form of The Red Queen .
Instead , Bobin sought to make Time a " Twit " , further explaining that " There 's no one better at playing the confident idiot trope than Sacha Baron Cohen " , and adding that " it was very much with Sacha in mind " .
Principal photography began on August 4 , 2014 , at Shepperton Studios .
In August 2014 , filming took place in Gloucester Docks , which included the use of at least four historic ships : Kathleen and May , Irene , Excelsior , and the Earl of Pembroke , the last of which was renamed The Wonder for filming .
Principal photography ended on October 31 , 2014 .

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of " A ‚Äì " on an A+ to F scale , the same grade earned by its predecessor .
Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote in his review , " What does all this have to do with Lewis Carroll ?
Hardly anything " and that overall , " It 's just an excuse on which to hang two trite overbearing fables and one amusing one " .
Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the movie 1.5 out of 4 stars and called the film , " gaudy , loud , complacent , and vulgar . "
Stephen Whitty of New York Daily News called the film " hugely expensive and extravagantly stupid " and that , overall , the movie " is just one more silly Hollywood mashup , an innocent fantasy morphed into a noisy would - be blockbuster " .
Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com was deeply critical of Alice Through the Looking Glass , describing it as " the most offensive kind of film ... one that spends an enormous amount of money yet seems to have nothing on its mind but money .
You give it , they take it .
And you get nothing in return but assurances that you 're seeing magic and wonder .
The movie keeps repeating it in your ear , and flashing it onscreen in big block letters : MAGIC AND WONDER .
MAGIC AND WONDER .
But there is no magic , no wonder , just junk rehashed from a movie that was itself a rehash of Lewis Carroll , tricked out with physically unpersuasive characters and landscapes and ' action scenes ' , with blockbuster ' journey movie ' tropes affixed to every set - piece as blatantly as Post - It Notes . "
Kyle Smith of New York Post gave the film a positive review : "
The screenplay ( by Linda Woolverton ) is n't exactly heaving with brilliant ideas , but it works well enough as a blank canvas against which the special - effects team goes bonkers " .
Matthew Lickona of San Diego Reader said that while he found the visual effects to be " stupidly expensive " and the story familiar , he called it , " a solid kids ' movie in the old style " .
