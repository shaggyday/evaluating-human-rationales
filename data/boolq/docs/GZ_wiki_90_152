.300
AAC BLACKOUT
The .300 AAC Blackout ( designated as the 300 BLK by the SAAMI and 300 AAC Blackout by the C.I.P. ) , also known as 7.62×35 mm is a carbine cartridge developed in the United States by Advanced Armament Corporation ( AAC ) for use in the M4 carbine .
Its purpose is to achieve ballistics similar to the 7.62×39 mm Soviet cartridge in an AR-15 while using standard AR-15 magazines at their normal capacities .
It can be seen as a SAAMI - certified copy of J. D. Jones ' wildcat .300
Whisper .
Care should be taken not to use 300 BLK ammunition in a rifle chambered for 7.62×40 mm Wilson Tactical .
HISTORY Section::::History .
While 5.56×45 mm NATO has enjoyed widespread acceptance in military circles , the nature of the missions encountered by some special operations groups often demand a round that provides better performance than that available in the high - energy standard velocity rounds and subsonic performance greater than standard 9 mm ( the ubiquitous pistol round also commonly used in many SMGs ) .
To satisfy this need , AAC developed the 300 AAC Blackout in cooperation with Remington Defense — under the direction of AAC 's Research and Development Director Robert Silvers and with the support of the company 's founder , Kevin Brittingham .
Meeting these goals allowed the development team to negate many of the perceived drawbacks inherent to other large caliber cartridges used in the M4 .
Colt Firearms and other arms makers had previously chambered AR - pattern rifles and carbines in various .30 caliber rounds but encountered problems .
In the case of the 7.62×39 mm , its relatively severe case angle caused feeding issues unless specially modified AK-47 magazines were used , and even then results were unsatisfactory Modified bolts were also needed owing to its larger case head diameter .
Rounds such as the 6.8 SPC and 6.5 Grendel had similar part - interchangeability issues but did allow for the use of the standard M4 / M16 30-round magazine albeit with a reduced capacity .
Wildcat cartridges such as the .300 Whisper series addressed these issues , but their widespread use in single shot handguns and lack of industry standard cartridge dimension meant that a great number of the popular loads on both the supersonic and subsonic end of the spectrum were less than ideal in the AR pattern weapons .
Many of these rounds required an excessively long overall cartridge length that would prohibit feeding in a STANAG magazine while using powder charges that were not compatible with the pressure requirements of the M4 carbine .
This was particularly noticeable when using subsonic ammunition in conjunction with a suppressor as short stroking and excessive fouling would occur similar to that which was seen in the earliest variants of the M16 in Vietnam .
By keeping the M4 / M16 in mind as the primary host during load development
the designers could work up a host of cartridges that not only satisfied the ballistic requirements set forth , but also ensured mechanical reliability with the fewest changes to the weapon itself — with only a simple barrel change necessary for complete conversion .
Robert Silvers , director of research and development for AAC said , " We started development in 2009 , but most of the work was done in 2010 .
A military customer wanted a way to be able to shoot .30-cal .
bullets from an M4 platform while using normal bolts and magazines , and without losing the full 30-round capacity of standard magazines .
They also wanted a source for ammunition made to their specs .
We could not have just used .300-.221 or .300 Whisper because Remington is a SAAMI company , and will only load ammunition that is a SAAMI - standard cartridge .
We had to take the .300 - 221 wildcat concept , determine the final specs for it , and submit it to SAAMI .
We did that , and called it the .300 AAC Blackout ( .300 BLK ) . "
300 AAC BLACKOUT was approved by SAAMI on January 17 , 2011 .
On October 23 , 2011 , SSG Daniel Horner of the USAMU used 300 AAC Blackout to win his 4th USPSA Multi Gun National Championship .
MILITARY USE Section::::Military use .
No cartridge has been accepted as such by any military , but certain Special Operations elements have used it .
NETHERLANDS
Section::::Netherlands .
In July 2015 , the Netherlands ' Defense Material Organization issued a tender for 195 carbines chambered in 300 BLK on behalf of the Dutch Maritime Special Operations Force ( NL - MARSOF ) .
The intention was to purchase ball , subsonic and lead - free frangible cartridges representing the first formal military adoption of the .300 AAC Blackout .
In December 2016 the NL - MARSOF acquired 195 integrally suppressed SIG MCX carbines fitted with a new folding stock developed for use with ballistic visor helmets chambered in .300 AAC Blackout becoming the first publicly known military user of the cartridge .
UNITED KINGDOM Section::::United Kingdom .
On the 14th July 2017 , the United Kingdom issued a tender for a five year ( plus five years optional ) contract to supply .300″
Blackout supersonic and subsonic small arms ammunition .
Also noted was the fact that the ammunition type had already been in use .
UNITED STATES Section::::United States .
The US Special Operations Command ( SOCOM ) as of March 2017 , has requested defense industry proposals for conversion kits from 5.56 to the .300 AAC , highlighting interest in making the round more available to the wider Special Operations Community .
So far the .300 AAC has seen limited use within certain special operations forces , primarily within JSOC .

Energy
The 300 AAC Blackout was designed to achieve energies similar to the 7.62×39 mm Soviet in an AR-15 while using standard AR magazines at their full capacity .
The 7.62 Soviet 's cartridge taper prevented reliable feeding in AR magazines and created wear on the bolt .
From the barrel of the M4 Carbine , the M855 5.56×45 mm round has an effective point target range of 500 meters .
The bullet has significant drop , drift , and energy loss at that distance .
From a barrel , a 300 BLK round has a lower velocity and similar bullet drop and drift at shorter distances .
However , it has the same amount of energy at 700 meters that the M855 has at 500 meters .
In terms of hit probability , the Blackout has an effective range of 460 meters .
From a barrel , the 125 gr BLK round has the same muzzle energy as the M855 from the M4 , and 5 percent more energy at 440 meters .
In comparison with 7.62×39 mm rounds , 300 BLK rounds with varying loads have a better ballistic coefficient and more energy out of similar length barrels .
300 BLK rounds like the Barnes
TAC 110 grain , have " barrier blind " performance , being capable of penetration through several inches of different hard targets .
300 BLK allows a user to have one firearm with the capability of switching between subsonic , supersonic VMAX or barrier penetrating ammunition all with just the change of a magazine .
It is able to replace the H&K MP5 for close quarters , and with just a magazine change , bring the fight to longer distances , outperforming the M4 carbine .
The .30 caliber cartridge has an 89.1 percent increase in frontal bullet area over the 5.56×45 mm , and so leaves a larger wound cavity in soft targets .
It also penetrates deeper and initially yaws faster .
300 BLK rounds are effective out of barrels as short as .
Weapons chambered for the round can be as light , compact , and quiet when suppressed as submachine guns like the 9×19 mm MP5 , 5.7x28 mm FN P90 , and 4.6×30 mm MP7 while having more energy and accuracy at longer range . !

Compared to the 6.8×43 mm Special Purpose Cartridge , another round made to have increased stopping power over the 5.56 NATO , the 300 Blackout has different capabilities .
The 300 BLK was designed with a specific shorter - range focus to have equal or more energy than the 7.62 Soviet and work reliably with suppressors .
The earlier 6.8 SPC was simply designed to have more energy at all ranges than the 5.56×45 mm .
It has a relatively small projectile with a high velocity that maintains performance at range .
At , the 300 BLK drops lower than the 6.8 SPC , while it drops lower at .
The 6.8-round has a higher muzzle energy of due to its greater velocity , while the 300 BLK round has a muzzle energy of .
Both rounds were made to be used in an easily converted AR-15 .
The 6.8 SPC has a more difficult conversion because it was designed around the obsolete .30 Remington cartridge , requiring a different bolt and decreasing standard magazine capacity .
The 300 BLK was made specifically for ease of conversion , so the standard bolt will work and a magazine can be used to its full capacity , so the only change needed is the barrel .
POTENTIAL HAZARDS Section::::Potential hazards .
The very advantage of the 300 BLK ( its similarity to the popular .223/5.56 caliber ) can also be a safety issue if ammunition of the two calibers is mixed .
Because of similar chamber dimensions between the two calibers , SAAMI has listed the combination of using a 300 BLK round in a .223 chamber as unsafe .
Since the bullet of the 300 BLK is larger than the bore of the .223 caliber , chambering and firing would cause excessive pressure to build up since the bullet has nowhere to go , which can cause the rifle to explode resulting in risk of injury or death .
Since the mix up easily can be done , some suggest owners of firearms in both calibers carefully separate firearm and ammunition of the two types by , for instance , clearly marking the firearms and magazines , and visually inspect every round while loading magazines .
Whether a 300 BLK cartridge actually is able to chamber in a .223 barrel depends on bullet length and shape , bullet seating depth , crimping , and the volume of powder charge .
Ideally , cartridges would use one of the longer projectiles , a case - filling powder charge , and have the projectile crimped into place .
PREDECESSORS
* Pioneering work by the USAF Armament Lab at Eglin Air Force Base in the late 1960s produced the 7.62×28 mm cartridge which propelled a 172 gr match projectile to the range but suffered from various reliability issues .
*
More recently , popular wildcats such the .300 - 221 , 300 Fireball , and JD Jones ' proprietary version of them , the .300 Whisper , have furthered the concept .
The 300 AAC Blackout is a SAAMI standardized .300 - 221 .
Hornady states that any rifle chambered for the 300 AAC Blackout can shoot their .300 Whisper ammunition , which is made within 300 AAC Blackout specs .
The reloading dies for these two cartridges are often the same .
