SYNDROME
A syndrome is a set of medical signs and symptoms that are correlated with each other and , often , with a particular disease or disorder .
The word derives from the Greek σύνδρομον , meaning " concurrence " .
In some instances , a syndrome is so closely linked with a pathogenesis or cause that the words syndrome , disease , and disorder end up being used interchangeably for them .
This is especially true of inherited syndromes .
For example , Down syndrome , Wolf – Hirschhorn syndrome , and Andersen syndrome are disorders with known pathogeneses , so each is more than just a set of signs and symptoms , despite the syndrome nomenclature .
In other instances , a syndrome is not specific to only one disease .
For example , toxic shock syndrome can be caused by various toxins ; premotor syndrome can be caused by various brain lesions ; and premenstrual syndrome is not a disease but simply a set of symptoms .
If an underlying genetic cause is suspected but not known , a condition may be referred to as a genetic association ( often just " association " in context ) .
By definition , an association indicates that the collection of signs and symptoms occurs in combination more frequently than would be likely by chance alone .
Syndromes are often named after the physician or group of physicians that discovered them or initially described the full clinical picture .
Such eponymous syndrome names are examples of medical eponyms .
Recently , there has been a shift towards naming conditions descriptively ( by symptoms or underlying cause ) rather than eponymously , but the eponymous syndrome names often persist in common usage .
USAGE GENERAL MEDICINE
Section::::Usage .
Section::::General medicine .
In medicine a broad definition of syndrome is used , which describes a collection of symptoms and findings without necessarily tying them to a single identifiable pathogenesis .
The more specific definition employed in medical genetics describes a subset of all medical syndromes .
PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY Section::::Psychiatry and psychopathology .
Psychiatric syndromes often called psychopathological syndromes ( psychopathology is a psychic dysfunction occurring in mental disorder , also it 's the study of the origin , diagnosis , development , and treatment of mental disorders ) .
In Russia those psychopathological syndromes are used in modern clinical practice and described in psychiatric literature in the details : asthenic syndrome , obsessive syndrome , emotional syndromes ( for example , manic syndrome , depressive syndrome ) , Cotard 's syndrome , catatonic syndrome , hebephrenic syndrome , delusional and hallucinatory syndromes ( for example , paranoid syndrome , paranoid - hallucinatory syndrome , Kandinsky - Clérambault 's syndrome also known as syndrome of psychic automatism , hallucinosis ) , paraphrenic syndrome , psychopathic syndromes ( includes all personality disorders ) , clouding of consciousness syndromes ( for example , twilight clouding of consciousness , amential syndrome also known as amentia , delirious syndrome , stunned consciousness syndrome , oneiroid syndrome ) , hysteric syndrome , neurotic syndrome , Korsakoff 's syndrome , hypochondriacal syndrome , paranoiac syndrome , senestopathic syndrome , encephalopathic syndrome .
There are some examples of the psychopathological syndromes used in modern Germany : psychoorganic syndrome , depressive syndrome , paranoid - hallucinatory syndrome , obsessive - compulsive syndrome , autonomic syndrome , hostility syndrome , manic syndrome , apathy syndrome .
Münchausen syndrome , Ganser syndrome , neuroleptic - induced deficit syndrome ,
olfactory reference syndrome are also well known .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The most important psychopathological syndromes were divided by severity by German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin ( 1856—1926 ) into three groups .
The first group , which included the mild disorders , includes five syndromes : emotional , paranoid , hysterical , delirious , impulsive .
The second intermediate group includes two syndromes : schizophrenic syndrome and speech - hallucinatory syndrome .
The third group includes the most severe disorders .
The third group includes three syndromes : epileptic , oligophrenic and dementia .
Epilepsy in these times has been viewed as a mental illness .
Karl Jaspers is considered the " genuine epilepsy " to be a " psychosis " too .
He describes " the three major psychoses " : schizophrenia , epilepsy , and manic - depressive illness .
MEDICAL GENETICS Section::::Medical genetics .
In the field of medical genetics , the term " syndrome " is traditionally only used when the underlying genetic cause is known .
Thus , Trisomy 21 is commonly known as Down syndrome .
Until 2005 , CHARGE syndrome was most frequently referred to as " CHARGE association " .
When the major causative gene ( CHD7 ) for the condition was discovered , the name was changed .
The consensus underlying cause of VACTERL association has not been determined , and thus it is not commonly referred to as a " syndrome " .
OTHER FIELDS
Section::::Other fields .
In biology , " syndrome " is used in a more general sense to describe characteristic sets of features in various contexts .
Examples include behavioral syndromes , as well as pollination syndromes and seed dispersal syndromes .
NAMING
Section::::Naming .
There is no set common convention for the naming of newly identified syndromes .
In the past , syndromes were often named after the physician or scientist who identified and described the condition in an initial publication , these are referred to as " eponymous syndromes " .
In some cases , diseases are named after the patient who initially presents with symptoms , or their home town ( Stockholm syndrome ) .
There have been isolated cases of patients being eager to have their syndromes named after them , while their physicians are hesitant .
When a syndrome is named after a person , there is some difference of opinion as to whether it should take the possessive form or not ( Down syndrome vs. Down 's syndrome ) .
North American usage has tended to favor the non - possessive form , while European references often use the possessive .
Even in Europe , there has been a trend away from the possessive form , over the period between 1970 and 2008 .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Avicenna , in The Canon of Medicine ( published 1025 ) , pioneered the idea of a syndrome in the diagnosis of specific diseases .
The concept of a medical syndrome was further developed in the 17th century by Thomas Sydenham .
UNDERLYING CAUSE Section::::Underlying cause .
Even in syndromes with no known etiology , the presence of the associated symptoms with a statistically improbable correlation , normally leads the researchers to hypothesize that there exists an unknown underlying cause for all the described symptoms .
