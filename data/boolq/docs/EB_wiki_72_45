NORTH CAROLINA
TAR HEELS FOOTBALL
The North Carolina Tar Heels football team represents the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the sport of American football .
The Tar Heels have played in the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) and the Coastal Division of the Atlantic Coast Conference ( ACC ) .
Being the oldest public university and oldest collegiate team in the Carolinas , the school is nicknamed " Carolina " in athletics .
The program 's title in football is " Carolina Football " .
North Carolina has played in 31 bowl games in its history and won three Southern Conference championships and five Atlantic Coast Conference titles .
Thirty Tar Heel players have been honored as first - team All - Americas on 38 occasions .
Carolina had 32 All - Southern Conference selections when it played in that league until 1952 and since joining the ACC in 1953 , has had 174 first - team All - ACC choices .
Since joining the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1953 , the team has won five conference championships , with the most recent title coming in 1980 .
One very important contribution to the game of football by Carolina is the modern use of the forward pass ; they were the first college team to use the play in 1895 .
Bob Quincy notes in his 1973 book
They Made the Bell Tower Chime :
" John Heisman , a noted historian , wrote 30 years later that , indeed , the Tar Heels had given birth to the forward pass against the Bulldogs ( UGA ) .
It was conceived to break a scoreless deadlock and give UNC a 6–0 win .
The Tar Heels were in a punting situation and a Georgia rush seemed destined to block the ball .
The punter , with an impromptu dash to his right , tossed the ball and it was caught by George Stephens , who ran 70 yards for a touchdown . "
The program has long been overshadowed by the school 's powerhouse men 's basketball team .
While not a consistent football powerhouse , the Carolina football program has had intermittent success and has featured a number of great players , many of whom have gone on to prominence in the National Football League , including Lawrence Taylor , Charlie Justice , Chris Hanburger , Ken Willard , Don McCauley , William Fuller , Harris Barton , Jeff Saturday , Alge Crumpler , Willie Parker , Greg Ellis , Dré Bly , Julius Peppers and Hakeem Nicks .

DICK CRUM ERA ( 1978–1987 ) Section::::Dick Crum era ( 1978–1987 ) .
Dick Crum was hired away from Miami ( OH ) to replace Dooley .
Crum brought with him a tough , rigid philosophy of an aggressive offense powered by a strong running game and a defensive scheme that emphasized ball control and fundamentals .
In his first season , Crum led the 1978 Tar Heels to a 5–6 record , which included lossses to No .
18 Maryland ,
No . 9 Pittsburgh and No . 15 Clemson .
In 1979 , the Tar Heels finished 8–3–1 with a win over Michigan in the Gator Bowl to finish the season .
Crum enjoyed his best season at Carolina in 1980 , leading the Heels to a record of 11–1 , a Bluebonnet Bowl win over Texas and an ACC Championship , Carolina 's last to date .
In 1981 , the Heels compiled a 10–2 record and finished the season by beating Arkansas in the Gator Bowl .
That would be Carolina 's last season of double digit wins for 15 years .
The next two seasons saw Carolina finish 8–4 .
After the 1982 season , Carolina upset Texas in the Sun Bowl .
In 1983 , they would lose to Florida State in the Peach Bowl .
In 1984 , Carolina would finish 5–5–1 .
They would post another five - win campaign the next year , along with six losses .
Carolina would go 7–4–1 with an Aloha Bowl loss to Arizona to end the season in 1986 , but Carolina would finish 5–6 in 1987 , increasing the unhappiness fans and administration had slowly built over the past few years of mediocrity and inconsistency .
Crum resigned under pressure as Tar Heels head coach after nine seasons .
Crum led the Tar Heels to four bowl victories in six bowl appearances .
Crum departed as the winningest head coach in Carolina football history , with a 72–41–3 record .
Notable players coached by Crum at UNC include Harris Barton , Kelvin Bryant , Reuben Davis and Lawrence Taylor .
MACK BROWN ERA ( 1988–1997 ) Section::::Mack Brown era ( 1988–1997 ) .
Mack Brown was hired away from Tulane as Crum 's replacement .
He was the Tar Heel 's head football coach for nine seasons .
Brown 's first two teams finished with identical 1–10 records , the worst two seasons that the Tar Heels have suffered on the field in modern times .
However , the next two years saw a relatively quick return to respectability .
In 1990 , the Tar Heels finished 6–4–1 .
By comparison , the Tar Heels had won only seven games in the previous three years .
Included in the 1990 total was a tie of Georgia Tech that proved to be the Yellow Jackets ' only non - win that season en route to a share of the national championship .
In 1991 , the Tar Heels finished 7–4 , narrowly missing a bowl bid .
Everything finally came together for the Tar Heels in 1992 .
They finished 8–3 in the regular season and second in the Atlantic Coast Conference , and with a victory over Mississippi State in the Peach Bowl , they finished the season at 9–3 .
The Peach Bowl was the program 's first bowl appearance since 1986 , first bowl win since 1982 , and first appearance in a final Top 25 poll since 1982 .
The 1992 season was the start of UNC 's most successful period since the Charlie Justice era in the late 1940s .
Brown coached the Tar Heels to five consecutive bowl games , including UNC 's only two New Year 's Day bowl games in more than half a century ( or three , if one counts the 1992–93 Peach Bowl , which was played the day after New Year 's to avoid a conflict with the Sugar Bowl ) .
The Tar Heels were ranked in the AP Top 25 every week from October 1992 through the start of the 1995 season .
They finished in the final rankings in four out of five years , including two straight appearances in the top 10 .
Carolina won 10 regular - season games in 1993 , only the second time the Tar Heels accomplished the feat , with the only losses coming to No . 1 Florida State , No .
21 Virginia in the regular season and No . 18
Alabama in the Gator Bowl .
In 1994 , Brown led the Tar Heels to an 8–4 record with a loss to Texas in the Sun Bowl to cap the year .
UNC lost to No . 3 Florida State , No . 25 Virginia , and No . 24 Clemson .
Brown 's seventh season in 1995 saw the Tar Heels finish 7–5 with a victory over Arkansas in the Carquest Bowl to finish the season .
In 1996 and 1997 , the Tar Heels finished with ten and eleven wins , respectively .
Brown would leave North Carolina in 1997 for the head coaching position at Texas .
Largely due to Florida State joining the league in 1992 , Brown was unable to win an ACC title — something the Tar Heels have n't done since 1980 .
Brown 's tenure was also known for the rise in popularity in the Tar Heel football program that , while respectable in its own right , was overshadowed by the Tar Heel 's national powerhouse men 's basketball program .
Games at Kenan Memorial Stadium were almost always sold out , highlighted by the 62,000 that showed to watch the Tar Heels ' game against Florida State in 1997 , the largest crowd at a regular season college football game in the history of the state of North Carolina .
Brown also led an effort that resulted in upgrading UNC 's football facilities and the expansion of Kenan Memorial Stadium .
Notable players who played for Brown at North Carolina include Jeff Saturday , Greg Ellis and Dré Bly .
CARL TORBUSH ERA ( 1998–2000 )
Section::::Carl Torbush era ( 1998–2000 ) .
Carl Torbush was promoted from defensive coordinator to head coach of the UNC Tar Heels football program following Brown 's departure .
Torbush 's hiring was praised by many UNC fans and alum , who felt Torbush 's performance as defensive coordinator was superb and that an in - program hire was the best way to maintain the momentum generated by Mack Brown .
Despite the loss of most of the team 's defensive stars of the last three years , the Tar Heels were expected to pick up right where they left off in 1998 .
However , they never really recovered from an unexpected loss to Miami ( Ohio ) to open the 1998 season , during which Carolina went 6 - 5 and barely managed to qualify for a bowl appearance .
Torbush led the Tar Heels to the Las Vegas Bowl , where they defeated San Diego State by a score of 20–13 .
The next year was an unmitigated disaster .
The team was riddled with injuries , the most devastating one occurring when quarterback Ronald Curry tore his Achilles tendon .
The Tar Heels were so thin at quarterback that they were forced to convert safety Antwon Black to quarterback , but he was lost after two games to mononucleosis .
After starting the season 1–1 , the Tar Heels did n't win another game until beating North Carolina State in November .
They finished 3–8 , UNC 's first losing season since Mack Brown 's two consecutive 1–10 seasons in 1988 and 1989 .
School officials actually planned to fire him after the season , but an outpouring of support from players and fans led to a change of heart .
He was , however , forced to fire several members of his staff , including offensive coordinator Steve Marshall , who had been criticized for being too conservative in his play calling .
The Tar Heels rebounded to finish 6–5 in 2000 , but it was n't enough to save Torbush 's job ; he was fired at the end of the season .
Torbush left Carolina with a record of 17–18 .
Notable players who played for Torbush at UNC are Julius Peppers , Alge Crumpler and Jeff Reed .
JOHN BUNTING ERA ( 2001–2006 )
Section::::John Bunting era ( 2001–2006 ) .
John Bunting was hired by his alma mater as the Tar Heels head coach after the firing of Torbush despite no FBS coaching experience of any kind , assistant coaching or head coaching .
In his first season , Bunting led the Tar Heels to an 8 - 5 record , which included a win over No . 6 Florida State 41 - 9 ; the Seminoles were ranked sixth in the AP Poll at the time .
and a victory over Auburn in the 2001 Peach Bowl .
However , his teams since were highly inconsistent .
In 2002 , Bunting 's Tar Heels finished 3–9 .
That was followed by a 2–10 campaign in 2003 .
In 2004 , the Tar Heels finished 6–6 .
UNC defeated Miami 31 - 28 on a last - second field goal by Connor Barth during the 2004 season ; the Hurricanes were ranked fourth at the time in the AP poll .
The Tar Heels capped the 2004 season with a loss in the Continental Tire Bowl to Boston College by a score of 37 - 24 .
In 2005 , North Carolina finished 5–6 .
The team was routed during the 2005 season 69 - 14 by Louisville , one of the worst losses in modern Tar Heel history .
During his final season ( 2006 ) , his team had a record of 3 - 9 , while averaging over 23 fewer points per game than their opponents .
Bunting was fired by UNC athletics director Dick Baddour on October 22 , 2006 .
He was allowed to finish out the 2006 season .
Bunting 's last home victory on November 18 , 2006 , against NC State , broke a seven - game losing streak , and he was able to close out his career one week later with a 45 - 44 win over Duke .
Bunting , who led UNC to their only two victories over a top 10 ranked opponent in school history , compiled an overall record of 27 - 45 over six seasons .
BUTCH DAVIS ERA ( 2007–2010 )
Section::::Butch Davis era ( 2007–2010 ) .
Former Cleveland Browns and Miami head football coach Butch Davis was hired as the Tar Heels 32nd head football coach in late 2006 .
Davis was a big - name coach whose hiring was praised nationwide .
Davis originally signed a seven - year deal worth approximately $ 1.86 million per season , with a base salary of $ 286,000 .
Additionally , he received $ 25,000 a year in expenses and a supplement from the Educational Foundation ( Ram 's Club ) that ranged from $ 1 million in 2007 to $ 1.3 million in 2013 .
Davis took over a program that had seen three winning seasons in the past eight years and had won more than six games in a season two other times .
During his first season as head coach , the 2007 Tar Heels finished 4–8 , with six of those losses coming by a touchdown or less and two coming against teams ranked in the top 15 at the time .
Despite a losing record in 2007 , North Carolina fans averaged over 57,000 fans in Kenan Stadium during the season , the highest average attendance since the Mack Brown era .
The 2007 match - up against South Carolina saw a crowd of 61,000 , the second - largest in school history .
During the season , suspicion mounted that Davis would leave UNC after his first year if the head coaching job at his alma mater , Arkansas , opened up .
The rumors grew louder when Houston Nutt was forced to resign at Arkansas , but Davis denied he was leaving .
On November 21 , 2007 , Davis agreed to a one - year contract extension , along with a raise of about $ 291,000 annually .
Davis said in a statement that one year at UNC convinced him that this was where he wanted to be , and that he intended to have " a long and successful career in Chapel Hill . "
Athletics director Dick Baddour said he could not release all the details of the contract until it was approved by the school 's board of trustees , but did say the base salary would rise $ 29,000 , the expenses would go up $ 5,000 , and Davis ' supplemental income would go up $ 100,000 .
2008
North Carolina Tar Heels football team were expected to be much improved from the previous year , with most outlets picking them to finish second in the Coastal Division .
On October 4 , the Heels defeated the then 24th - ranked Connecticut Huskies 38–12 for their first victory over a ranked non - conference opponent in 11 years .
As a result , the Tar Heels were ranked 22nd in the weekly Associated Press rankings , their first appearance in a major poll in seven years .
The following Saturday , the Tar Heels defeated the Notre Dame Fighting Irish , their first regular - season win as a ranked team in 11 years .
A crowd of 60,500 , third - largest in school history , watched the Tar Heels play the Fighting Irish .
A 16–13 overtime loss at Virginia on October 18 briefly knocked the Heels out of the rankings , but after a 45 - 24 victory over Boston College on October 25 , the team became bowl - eligible for the first time since 2004 .
The win also resulted in the team being ranked in the Bowl Championship Series rankings for the first time since the BCS began in 1998 .
A week later , they defeated Georgia Tech to clinch their first winning season since 2001 , and only their fourth since Brown left the school after the 1997 season .
The Tar Heels lost three of their last four games , including a loss in the Meineke Car Care Bowl to West Virginia .
Davis led the 2009 Tar Heels to another 8–4 regular season record and a second straight bowl appearance , the first time since the 1997–1998 seasons that UNC had made consecutive bowl appearances .
A loss to North Carolina State in the final game of the season sent them back to the Meineke Car Care Bowl .
UNC faced the Pittsburgh Panthers on December 26 , 2009 and lost for the second straight year , giving UNC another 8–5 final record .
Additionally , Davis led Carolina football to its 6th consecutive year of graduating more than 75 % of its football players .
The America Football Coaches Association recognized fewer than 30 public universities for superior graduation rates that year , with UNC the only such institution in the state of North Carolina and the Atlantic Coast Conference .
In July 2010 , the NCAA began investigating violations involving improper benefits provided by agents to current players at UNC .
In September 2010 , the NCAA opened a second prong of its investigation , this time involving possible improper tutor involvement with UNC student - athletes .
In response to the investigation , local and national sports columnists called for Davis ' termination , but some North Carolina fans still supported the coach .
A survey of UNC fans reflected strong support for Coach Davis despite the ongoing investigation .
Thirteen UNC football players were suspended for the team 's season opener in Atlanta against LSU , and the Tar Heels lost the game 30–24 .
The Tar Heels later lost to ACC rivals Miami , Georgia Tech , Virginia Tech , and NC State , but won their first game since 1981 in Virginia 's Scott Stadium and gained their first win ever in FSU 's Doak Campbell Stadium .
In October 2010 , wide receiver Greg Little , defensive tackle Marvin Austin , and defensive end Robert Quinn were ruled permanently ineligible after it was discovered they improperly accepted gifts from sports agents .
Five other players were found guilty of accepting improper benefits and/or inappropriate academic assistance .
On July 27 , 2011 , Davis was fired by UNC chancellor Holden Thorp amid an NCAA investigation of academic misconduct and allegations players receiving improper benefits from agents .
Davis left Carolina after compiling a 28–23 record .
Thorp said the move was necessary to restore confidence in UNC 's integrity .
On September 19 , 2011 , in response to an NCAA notice of allegations , Davis was never mentioned in the NCAA inquiry and had no involvement in the investigation .
North Carolina subsequently vacated all of its wins from the 2008 and 2009 seasons after retroactively declaring Austin , Quinn and Little ineligible .
As a result , these are " officially " North Carolina 's only winless seasons in the modern era .
In 2013 , Davis told CBS Sports ' Bruce Feldman that he believed his firing was an " overreaction " by Thorp , in the belief that " if he released me , maybe the investigation of the football program would go in a different direction . "
Around the same time , Baddour told Feldman that firing Davis " was not my recommendation . "
Baddour added that Thorp was well aware that he wanted Davis to remain as coach .
NCAA investigation 2010–2011
In July 2010 , it was reported that the program was being investigated by the NCAA due to possible connections with sport agents .
The football program was also under investigation for academic fraud and a failure to properly monitor players , which the NCAA found to be true .
Seven players from the UNC football program , including starters and once top recruits Greg Little and Marvin Austin , were reported to have accepted more than $ 27,000 in impermissible benefits in 2009 and 2010 .
Following an NCAA investigation into misconduct , in July 2011 , head coach Butch Davis was fired and replaced by interim coach Everett Withers .
Also , in September 2011 , the program decided to vacate all its wins from the 2008 and 2009 seasons , reduce its scholarship athletes by 3 , begin serving two years of probation , and pay a $ 50,000 fine .
The NCAA later increased the penalties to a reduction of athletic scholarships by 15 , three years of probation , and a post - season ban of one year .
EVERETT WITHERS ERA ( 2011 ) Section::::Everett Withers era ( 2011 ) .
