GULF DEVELOPMENTAL ROAD
The Gulf Developmental Road links the Cairns and Normanton regions in northern Queensland , Australia .
It is the only sealed ( asphalt ) road linking these two regions .
In the east , the road begins at an unnamed junction on the southern edge of Forty Mile Scrub National Park , 241 km south - west of Cairns .
The Gulf Developmental Road runs west before terminating at its junction with the Burke Developmental Road 7 km south of Normanton , a total distance of 442 km .
Towns along the route include Mount Surprise , Georgetown and Croydon .
There are no other communities along the route , but it passes through the ghost town of Cumberland .
The road is sealed for its full length , but as of 2018 there are many sections of the road which are only single lane bitumen .
These sections require caution when passing other traffic as the shoulders are gravel and vehicles need to move partly onto the shoulders .
They extend between points about 55 kilometres west of Georgetown and 20 kilometres west of Mount Surprise .
The Gulf Developmental Road is designated Highway 1 ; however , it is not part of the National Highway network .
