GOOGLE SITES
Google Sites is a structured wiki- and Web page - creation tool offered by Google .
The goal of Google Sites is for anyone to be able to create simple web sites that support collaboration between different editors .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Google Sites started out as JotSpot , the name and sole product of a software company that offered enterprise social software .
It was targeted mainly at small - sized and medium - sized businesses .
The company was founded by Joe Kraus and Graham Spencer , co - founders of Excite .
In February 2006 , JotSpot was named part of Business 2.0 , " Next Net 25 " , and in May 2006 , it was honored as one of InfoWorld 's " 15 Start - ups to Watch " .
In October 2006 , JotSpot was acquired by Google .
Google announced a prolonged data transition of webpages created using Google Page Creator ( also known as " Google Pages " ) to Google Sites servers in 2007 .
On February 28 , 2008 , Google Sites was unveiled using the JotSpot technology .
The service was free , but users needed a domain name , which Google offered for $ 10 .
However , as of May 21 , 2008 , Google Sites became available for free , separately from Google Apps , and without the need for a domain .
In June 2016 , Google introduced a complete rebuild of the Google Sites platform , named New Google Sites , along with transition schedule from Classic Google Sites .
