SPLIT ( BOWLING )
A split is a situation in ten pin bowling in which the first ball of a frame knocks down the headpin ( " number 1 bowling pin " ) but leaves standing two or more non - adjacent groups of one or more pins .
Scoring a spare in this situation is often referred to as a " killer shot " .
TYPES 7–10
SPLIT
Section::::Types .
Section::::7–10 split .
One of the most infamous of splits is the 7–10 split , often called " goal posts " or " bedposts " , where the bowler is left with the leftmost and the rightmost pin in the back row ( the number 7 and number 10 ) to knock down with a single ball to achieve a spare .
This is also one of the most difficult splits to pick up .
There are two ways to convert this split .
The first is to strike either pin and have it bounce out of the pit area and strike the remaining pin .
This not only requires substantial ball speed but the pin must be struck in the right spot .
Additionally , a pin flying out from the pit is a fairly rare occurrence .
This is made more difficult by variation of the pit design according to the pinsetter system , with the Brunswick A-2 being more prone to bounce - outs than recent machines .
Bouncing out on a Brunswick GS - series pinsetter is exceedingly difficult due to a moving curtain at the back of the pit which absorbs the impact , while AMF pinsetters have a higher chance of bouncing out the pin facing away from the ball return of a lane pair .
The second method is to strike either pin on the inside with enough velocity to bounce it off the side wall ( kickback plate ) and rebound onto and across the deck into the other pin .
Sliding the pin directly will not work since the ball will fall off the lane before it gets far enough aside the 7 or 10 pin to slide it directly across .
Despite this fact , many television shows and movies over the years have depicted the 7–10 split being converted by directly sliding one pin into another .
In each case , the " conversion " was rigged by either moving the sliding pin over on a deck without pin spots ( giving the ball extra room to slide the pin sideways and making it look like the pin was spotted correctly ) or by having some help ( human or mechanical ) from the pit to " slide " the pin over .
Barring such " Hollywood magic " in real life , a freak bounce out of the pit or a side wall rebound are the only realistic ways to convert a 7–10 split .
Mark Roth was the first bowler to pick up the 7 - 10 split on television on January 5 , 1980 at the ARC Alameda Open at Mel 's Southshore Bowl in Alameda , California .
The only other two professionals to convert this split on television are John Mazza and Jess Stayrook , both of which did it in 1991 ; nobody has done it on television since .
Roth and Mazza did theirs on ABC broadcasts of the Professional Bowlers Tour , while Stayrook did his on an ESPN telecast .
OTHER COMMON SPLITS Cincinnati (
7–9 or 8–10 )
This is similar to the 7–10 , as they are both splits with pins on the back row of the deck .
It is also just about as difficult to convert .
However , it is possible to slide the 9 or 8-pin into the 7 or 10 pin , but there is only a 0.05 inch ( 1 mm ) margin of error .
( 5–7 ) or Woolworth / Kresge / Dime store ( 5–10 ) Similar to a 6–7 split , but since the pins are closer , the 5-pin does not need to be hit at such a fine angle to hit the 7-pin .
Another rare method is to deflect an extremely light ball ( under 10 lb ) off the 5-pin .
Sour apple , Lily , Full Murray , or Three wise men ( 5–7–10 ) Similar to above , one must use a light ball ( under 10 lb ) to deflect the 5-pin into either the 7- or 10-pin , deflecting the ball into the other back pin .
It is also possible to slide the 5-pin into either back pin ; with luck , either downed pin ( depending on which side the bowler chooses to go ) will slide or roll into the third pin .
It is among the most difficult splits to convert .
Section::::Other common splits .
The 5–7–10 is considered the most embarrassing split of all , because not only is it almost impossible to make , it is left by throwing a " flat ball " , that is , a shot with no revolutions or action on it .
3–7 split ( or 2 - 10 ) Similar to a 5–7 split , but since the 3-pin is two rows ahead of the further from the 7-pin , the ball must hit the right side of the 3-pin at a slight angle .
Baby split or Murphy ( 2–7 or 3 - 10 )
This is the easiest split to convert since there are two options : A ) sliding the 2-pin into the 7-pin
; B ) deflecting the ball off the " front " pin .
This can be achieved with a ball of any weight since the pins are close enough together .
Cocked hat or Christmas tree ( 2–7–10 or 3–7–10 )
This split is basically the Baby split with the opposite corner pin .
The player should ignore that " opposite " pin and play the Baby split between the pins .
With luck , the front pin will be able to slide over to get the other pin .
4–7–10 and 6–7–10
These splits are similar to the 7 - 10 split , but are easier to pick up because of the extra pin .
Always aim for the side with the two pins to ensure a possibility of a pick - up .
Note that these splits are identical to the 4 - 10 and 6 - 7 .
Big four ( 4–6–7–10 )
The Big four ( also known as The " Golden Gate split " , " Big ears " or " Grandma 's teeth " split ) consists of the two pins on either side of the pin deck .
It is similar to the 4–7–10 and the 6–7–10 , as a common attempt to make the split will consist of sliding the 4 or 6 pin into the remaining two pins on the other side ( the ball will take out either the 7 or 10 pin ) .
As with virtually all splits , it is possible to make by bouncing a pin out of the pit .
An older nickname for this split is " Double pinochle " .
The only professional to convert this split on television is Walter Ray Williams , Jr. , doing so on an ESPN telecast in 2005 .
Side - by - side splits ( 4–5 ; 5–6 ; 7–8 ;
9–10 ) Similar to baby splits because of their close distance from one another , the side - by - side split is almost always made by fitting the ball in between the two pins left standing .
A much rarer conversion of the split involves sliding one pin into the other .
A similar split ( 4–5–7 or 5–6–10 ) should be made the same way .
Also called " Fit splits ; " the 4–5 was referred to as the " Steam fitter " on Make
That Spare .
Greek church ( 4–6–7–8–10 or 4–6–7–9–10 )
This split is similar to the Big four , except there is another pin included ( either the 8 or 9 pin ) .
This split is believed to be slightly easier to convert than the Big four , because sliding the 6-pin over ( for right - handers ) will sometimes cause the 6-pin to ricochet off the 9-pin and set a crash course for the 4 and 7 pins .
Also " shooting the two " ( 4 - 7 for right - handers ) can work if the bowler can get the 4 pin to glance
/ bounce off the front of the 9 pin .
Statistical review , however , reveals this shot to be the least - converted in professional bowling .
Big five ( 3–4–6–7–10 or 2–4–6–7–10 )
This split is most easily converted by sliding either the 2-pin ( for left - handers ) or the 3-pin ( for right - handers ) into the two pins on the other side of the pin deck .
The ball should take out either the 6–10 ( for right - handers ) or the 4–7 ( for left - handers ) .
Big six ( 2–4–6–7–8–10 or 3–4–6–7–9–10 )
a.k.a .
" Greek cathedral " , " Four through the middle " or " The PBA four " or " Double trouble "
This split is similar to the Big five , but is made slightly harder because there is another pin in the back row , creating a split with two pins on one side and four pins on the other .
The split should be made with a drastic curve on the back end of the lane , so that the ball can convert the four pins and have the frontmost pin take the two remaining pins out .
Washouts
Although not a split , as the headpin ( 1 pin ) is still standing , washouts involve a setup of pins which are spaced out , including the headpin .
Common examples of the washout include the 1–2–4–10 , 1–2–8–10 , 1–3–6–7 , and 1–2–10 .
Washouts are easier than most splits , because the headpin is in the front of the pin deck and therefore gives the bowler more room for error .
The type of washout one leaves largely depends on if the bowler is left - handed or right - handed .
For example , a left - handed bowler would leave washouts such as the 1–3–6–7 and 1–3–7–9 , while a right - handed bowler would leave the 1–2–4–10 and 1–2–8–10 .
Modern variants include the 1 - 2 - 4 - 6 - 10 and 1 - 3 - 4 - 6 - 7 , where the bowler only picked a single pin out as opposed to the normal two ( picked 3 pin for right - handers , 2 pin for left - handers ) .
UNCOMMON SPLITS
Section::::Uncommon splits .
With the use of six - pound balls and/or very slow ball speeds , other splits not normally seen can be left due to that light - weight ball either deflecting into the gutter or stopping on the pin deck after contacting the pins .
An example of this is the 6 - 7 - 8 - 9 - 10 .
EQUIVALENT SPLITS Section::::Equivalent splits .
Since the pins are set up as an equilateral triangle , identically spaced splits can occur on different parts of the lane .
Converting them would be done in the same manner .
* 7–9 = 8–10 , 4–6 * 5–7
= 2–6 * ,
3–4 * , 4–9 , 5–10 , 6–8 * 3–7 = 2–10
* 3–10 = 2–7 , 2–9
* , 3–8 * , 1–4 * , 1 - 6
* ( technically the last two are not splits , see " Washouts " above ) * 2–3 * = 4–5 , 5–6 , 7–8 , 8–9 * , 9–10 ( known as " Fit splits " ) SPLITS IN CANDLEPIN BOWLING Section::::Splits in candlepin bowling .
As in the tenpin game , splits can also occur in the New England and Canadian Maritimes - centered sport of candlepin bowling .
As candlepin bowling uniquely allows the use of fallen " dead wood " pins to remain on the lane to be used in assisting the felling of standing pins for spare and split conversions , still the most notable split in the candlepin sport is the dreaded " spread eagle " , the six - pin leave made up of the 2 - 3 - 4 - 6 - 7 - 10 combination , that due to the aforementioned " fit split " status of the 2 - 3 split in tenpins ( but , with the smaller candlepin ball , the 2 and 3 pin ca n't be hit together with it ) and the " spread eagle " almost never occurs in tenpins , with the closest split to it being the 2-(or 3-)4 - 6 - 7 - 10 .
In contrast , even more difficult splits such as the infamous 7–10 split may be easier to convert in candlepin , since fallen pins are left on the lane after being knocked down ; thus , if enough pins are spread across the lane , a strategically bowled ball could knock the fallen pins into both the 7 and 10 at the same time .
