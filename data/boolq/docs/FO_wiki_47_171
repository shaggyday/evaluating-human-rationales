FC BARCELONA B
Futbol Club Barcelona B is a Spanish football team based in Barcelona , in the autonomous community of Catalonia .
Founded in 1970 as FC Barcelona Atlètic , it is the reserve team of FC Barcelona , and currently plays in Segunda División B , holding home matches at the Mini Estadi .
Reserve teams in Spain play in the same league system as the senior team , rather than in a reserve team league .
They must play at least one level below their main side , and thus Barcelona B are ineligible for promotion to La Liga .
They also can not play in the Copa del Rey .
HISTORY ESPANYA INDUSTRIAL Section::::History .
Section::::Espanya Industrial .
Founded on 1 August 1934 as Societat Esportiva Industrial Espanya , the club was originally the sports team of the factory with the same name , and its shirt featured blue and white vertical stripes .
The company was owned by the family of Josep Antoni de Albert , who was briefly president of FC Barcelona in 1943 ; during Albert 's presidency the club , now known as Club Deportivo Espanya Industrial , became Barcelona 's reserve team and began to play home games at Camp de Les Corts .
Initially , Industrial played in the local regional leagues but , in 1950 , it was promoted to Tercera División , reaching Segunda División two years later .
In 1953 the club finished as runners - up in both the league and the promotion play - off but , being a nursery club of Barcelona , it was unable to move up a division .

After winning another promotion play - off in 1956 , Espanya Industrial became independent of FC Barcelona and was renamed Club Deportivo Condal .
The club wore blue shirts with two white diagonals stripes .
Condal competed once in La Liga , in the 1956–57 season , being relegated as 16th and last .
In 1968 the club rejoined the Barcelona family as its reserve team , and adopted the blaugrana colours .

In 1970 , Barcelona president Agustí Montal decided to merge Condal with another junior club , Atlètic Catalunya , and formed Barcelona Atlètic .
Atlètic was founded in 1965 as a result of the merger of two other teams : UE Catalunya de Les Corts ( founded in 1918 as Catalunya Sporting Club ) and CD Fabra Coats ( 1926 ) .
Under the new denomination the B - team played a total of ten seasons in the second level .
At the end of 1988–89 the side returned to Segunda División B – the new third level created in 1977 – after ranking 17th .
In 1990 the team was renamed Barcelona B , but club president Joan Laporta changed the name back to Barcelona Atlètic in 2008 .
Two years later , his successor Sandro Rosell returned to the previous denomination .
Former club player Luis Enrique ( he also played for Real Madrid ) succeeded Pep Guardiola as team manager in the summer of 2008 , as the latter was appointed main squad coach .
In 2009–10 the club finished second in Group III and returned to division two after an absence of 11 years ; this was followed by a third - place in the following campaign , but the team was not eligible for promotion .
