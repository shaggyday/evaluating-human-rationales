PLOTS Section::::Plots .
The season follows the story of surgical residents , fellows , and attendings as they experience the difficulties of the competitive careers they have chosen .
It is set in the surgical wing of the fictional Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital , located in Seattle , Washington .
The season picks up right where it left off at Owen and Amelia 's wedding .
After Alex Karev ( Justin Chambers ) had found a drunk Jo Wilson ( Camilla Luddington ) with Andrew DeLuca ( Giacomo Gianniotti ) in a compromising situation during the previous season 's finale , he beats Andrew to a pulp , sending him to the hospital and subsequently landing Alex in jail .
Alex is charged with a felony and is at risk of serving substantial jail time until Andrew drops the charges .
Later , when Alex questions why Jo had turned down his proposal , she reveals that she is already married and has run away from her abusive husband .
Meanwhile , Nathan Riggs ( Martin Henderson ) continues to pursue Meredith Grey ( Ellen Pompeo ) after their recent sexual encounter , though Meredith has trouble letting go of her late husband , Derek Shepherd .
Maggie Pierce ( Kelly McCreary ) admits to Meredith that she has a crush on Nathan , unaware of Nathan and Meredith 's blossoming relationship , and asks him out , only to be rejected .
Maggie is later faced with a bigger issue when she discovers that her adoptive mother has cancer and has come to Grey - Sloan for treatment ; her mother eventually passes away .
April Kepner ( Sarah Drew ) and Jackson Avery ( Jesse Williams ) work together to co - parent their newborn daughter , Harriet , while maintaining a platonic relationship ; however , they sleep together when they travel to Montana to perform a surgery .
As Chief of Surgery , Miranda Bailey ( Chandra Wilson ) appoints Meredith as Head of General Surgery and hires Eliza Minnick ( Marika Domińczyk ) to run the training aspect of the hospital .
Though Arizona Robbins ( Jessica Capshaw ) goes on to date Minnick , the rest of the staff widely opposes Minnick 's teaching techniques and works to get her fired , only for Meredith to get temporarily suspended in the process .
Richard Webber ( James Pickens Jr. ) and Catherine Avery ( Debbie Allen ) argue over Minnick 's presence as well , making their marriage more divided than ever .
Owen Hunt ( Kevin McKidd ) and Amelia Shepherd ( Caterina Scorsone ) also have marital issues after Amelia reveals that she does n't want to have kids .
This causes Amelia to move out and hide out at Stephanie 's apartment .
During the season finale , a rapist is admitted to the hospital and attempts to attack Stephanie Edwards ( Jerrika Hinton ) and a young girl .
Stephanie starts a fire to escape the attacker , resulting in a small part of the hospital being gutted and a larger portion suffering smoke & water damage .
Owen 's missing sister , Megan , is found and transported to Seattle ; Meredith reveals this to Nathan and encourages him to return to Megan , whom he was engaged to before she was abducted .
