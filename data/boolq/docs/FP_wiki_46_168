LEGAL THREAT
A legal threat is a statement by a party that it intends to take legal action on another party , generally accompanied by a demand that the other party take an action demanded by the first party or refrain from taking or continuing actions objected to by the demanding party .
NATURE Section::::Nature .
Legal threats take many forms .
Common to all is that the party making the threat will take some form of action of a legal nature .
Most common is the threatened initiation of a lawsuit against the second party .
Other threats might include an administrative law action or complaint , referring the other party to a regulatory body , turning the party into the legal authorities over a crime or civil infraction , or the like .
Legal threats are often veiled or indirect , e.g. a threat that a party " shall be forced to consider its legal options " or " will refer the matter to legal counsel . "
TYPES CEASE AND DESIST Section::::Types .
Section::::Cease and desist .
A cease and desist ( C&D ) letter is a formalized legal demand that a party stop ( " cease " ) and refrain ( " desist " ) from an activity that the demanding party finds objectionable , generally couched in formal language accusing the activity of violating the law .
The objected - to activity may be most anything , although cease - and - desist letters are particularly common among certain areas of the law : * alleged intellectual property infringement ( e.g. patent infringement , trademark infringement , copyright infringement , etc . )
* alleged defamation such as libel and slander * harassment , nuisance , and other torts
* violation of certain agreements to not engage in certain commercial conduct ( e.g. with respect to competition , territories , etc . )
* where a personal financial and legal administrator ( e.g. as commonly appointed in Australia ) acting under an Order of a court for a represented person ( e.g. a person with an alleged disability ) for a specified time , as specified in the Order , continues the administration beyond the anniversary date ( end date ) of the Order , against the represented person 's wishes .
DEMAND LETTER
Section::::Demand letter .
A " demand letter " is a formalized demand by a party that another party pay money or take certain acts , often accompanied by a claim that the second party has engaged in illegal conduct , with an implicit or explicit threat that the demanding party will take some form of legal action .
EFFECT
Section::::Effect .
For the most part , a legal threat is of no legal significance other than a matter of negotiation tactics ; however , in certain instances a legal threat does have some legal significance .
Among other things , a legal threat may do the following :
* Establish notice - the party receiving the threat , and the party making the threat , are " on notice " of the circumstances and can not later claim they were unaware .
* Constitute extortion , blackmail , or some other crime or tort involving improper threats of harm : for example , it is considered unethical , and in some cases a crime , to threaten to report criminal conduct to the police unless a settlement is reached .
*
In some circumstances , a claim ( veiled or not ) that a party will take action based on alleged violation of the law gives rise to a right by the receiving party to bring an action for declaratory judgment that it has not broken the law : for example , if the holder of a trademark claims that a party is infringing a trademark , that party may bring suit asking a court to declare that there is in fact no infringement .
In addition to their legal significance , legal threats may create a number of practical results :
* Intimidating a party into acquiescing to the demand , whether or not there is a legal basis for it , out of fear of litigation expense , negative publicity , loss of entitlement ( e.g. losing a business license ) , or other negative consequence
* Alerting a party to illegal conduct it was unaware of , or that it did not realize was illegal or objectionable
* Delaying or disrupting lawful and legitimate activity , as the victim of the threats must devote time to obtaining expensive legal counsel .
* Risking public disclosure of the threat , thereby portraying the party making the threat in a bad light ( see the Streisand effect ) .
Threats of frivolous litigation against major news organisations are extraordinarily risky in this regard , as the newspaper will most often report the threat in the paper itself .
