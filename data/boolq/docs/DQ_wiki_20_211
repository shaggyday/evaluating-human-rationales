URINE - INDICATOR DYE Urine - indicator dye is a substance which is supposed to be able to react with urine to form a colored cloud in a swimming pool , thus indicating the location of people who are urinating while they are in the pool .
A 2015 report from the National Swimming Pool Foundation called this " the most common pool myth of all time " , with nearly half of Americans surveyed by researchers believing that the dye existed .
Rumors of this chemical 's existence go back at least as far as 1958 , and the story is commonly told to children by parents who do not wish them to urinate in the pool .
A 1985 biography of Orson Welles describes him using such a dye as part of a prank in 1937 , and references to the substance can be found through popular culture over quite a lengthy time period .
However , such a dye does not exist , and although a chemical could be manufactured that would react with urine , it would be difficult to prevent it from reacting to other organic substances present in pool water .
