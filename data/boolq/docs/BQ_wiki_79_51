TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM
The Trinidad and Tobago national football team , nicknamed the Soca Warriors , represents the twin - island Republic of Trinidad and Tobago in international football .
It is controlled by the Trinidad and Tobago Football Association and competes in both CONCACAF ( the Confederation of North , Central American and Caribbean Association Football ) and the Caribbean Football Union , its sub - continental confederation .
The team is ranked 93rd in the world according to the FIFA Rankings , and 89 in the World Football Elo Ratings .
They reached the first round of the 2006 World Cup and held the record of being the smallest nation ( both in size and population ) to ever qualify for a World Cup , until the 2018 World Cup , when Iceland broke the ( population ) record .
The national team competes in the World Cup and the Gold Cup , in addition to the Caribbean Cup and other competitions by invitation .
The Soca Warriors lone appearance at the World Cup came in 2006 after the team defeated Bahrain 2–1 on aggregate in the CONCACAF – AFC intercontinental play - off .
The team has qualified for the CONCACAF Gold Cup on eight occasions with their best performance in 2000 after reaching the semi - finals , finishing 3rd .
However , the national team has experienced great success in the Caribbean Cup having won the sub - continental competition eight times and runners - up on five occasions .
The separate Trinidad and Tobago national football teams are not related to the national team and are not directly affiliated with the game 's governing bodies of FIFA or CONCACAF , but are affiliated with the Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation .
HISTORY 1970S Section::::History .
Section::::1970s .
At the 1973 CONCACAF Championship , Trinidad and Tobago fell two points short of qualifying for the 1974 World Cup Finals in controversial fashion .
Trinidad and Tobago lost a crucial game on 4 December 1973 against hosts Haiti 2–1 after being denied five goals .
The referee , José Roberto Henríquez of El Salvador , and Canadian linesman James Higuet were subsequently banned for life by FIFA for the dubious events of the match .
1980S TO 1990S
: THE STRIKE SQUAD Section::::1980s to 1990s : The Strike Squad .
Trinidad and Tobago came within one game of qualifying for the 1990 World Cup in Italy .
Nicknamed the Strike Squad during the qualifying campaign , Trinidad and Tobago needed only a draw to qualify in their final game played at home against the United States on 19 November 1989 .
In front of an over - capacity crowd of more than 30,000 at the National Stadium on Red Day , Paul Caligiuri of the United States scored the only goal of the game in the 38th minute dashing Trinidad and Tobago 's qualification hopes .
For the good behaviour of the crowd at the stadium , despite the devastating loss and overcrowded stands , the spectators of Trinidad and Tobago were awarded the FIFA Fair Play Award in 1989 .

FIFA WORLD CUP Section::::2000s .
Section::::2006 FIFA World Cup .
Trinidad and Tobago qualified for the 2006 World Cup in Germany , its first - ever qualification for the tournament .
During their qualifying campaign , they sat at the bottom of the table in the final round of qualifying with one point from three .
However , after the arrival of Leo Beenhakker as team coach and the recalling of veteran players Dwight Yorke and Russell Latapy , Trinidad and Tobago reversed its fortunes and placed fourth in the group .
They qualified via a play - off against Bahrain , recovering from a 1–1 draw at home to win 1–0 in Manama , Bahrain to book a place in the finals .
As a result , Trinidad and Tobago became the smallest country to qualify for the FIFA World Cup , a record they held until Iceland reached their first World Cup in 2018 .
In Germany , Trinidad and Tobago were grouped with England , Sweden and Paraguay in Group B 2010S 2010 WORLD CUP CYCLE Section::::2010s .
Section::::2010 World Cup Cycle .
Trinidad and Tobago began their campaign in the Second Round with a home and away series against Bermuda .
Trinidad and Tobago lost the first match at home 1–2 , but bounced back to win the away leg in Bermuda 2–0 to progress to the third round 3–2 on aggregate .
The Soca Warriors advanced to Group 1 of the Third Round alongside the United States , Guatemala , and Cuba .
Trinidad and Tobago progressed to the Fourth Round by placing second in the group with eleven points from six games .
This qualified Trinidad and Tobago for the Fourth Round , or Hexagonal , against Costa Rica , El Salvador , Honduras , Mexico , and the United States .
The Fourth Round was also played in a home and away format among the six teams involved .
Qualification quickly turned disastrous for Trinidad and Tobago as they tied 2–2 with El Salvador after leading 2–0 .
They would then tie 1–1 with Honduras following a late - strike .
However , three consecutive losses to the United States , Costa Rica , and Mexico found the Soca Warriors bottom of the Hexagonal with two points from their first five matches .
In their sixth match , they recorded their first win of the round by defeating El Salvador 1–0 .
However , the victory was short lived as they suffered losses to Honduras and the United States the following month ; ending their hopes to qualify for the World Cup .

The Soca Warriors defeated Bermuda ( 1–0 ) and Bardados ( 2–0 ) in their first two matches to earn a full six points .
However , on 7 October 2011 , Trinidad and Tobago lost away to Bermuda in Devonshire Parish 2–1 to hurt its chances of advancing to the Third Round of qualification .
The team quickly rebounded four days later by defeating Barbados 4–0 in Hasely Crawford Stadium with a hat - trick from Lester Peltier .
Entering the final two matches in the Second Round , Trinidad and Tobago found itself in second place behind Guyana by one point .
As only the group winner would advance to the Third Round of qualification , the Soca Warriors needed to take four points in the next two matches both facing Guyana to advance .
Trinidad and Tobago first traveled to Providence , Guyana to face the Golden Jaguars on 11 November 2011 .
With an early goal from Ricky Shakes and another from Leon Cort in the 81st minute , Trinidad and Tobago found itself behind 2–0 and facing elimination .
Kenwyne Jones managed to pull the team within a goal in the 93rd minute , but it was too late as the match would end 2–1 in favor of Guyana .
With the loss , Trinidad and Tobago were officially eliminated from qualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup .
On 12 January 2012 , Otto Pfister was sacked following a disappointing campaign which saw the country 's earliest exit from World Cup qualification since 1994 .

TEAM IMAGE
HOME STADIUM Section::::Team image .
Section::::Home stadium .
For the first eighty years of their existence , Trinidad and Tobago played their home matches all around the country with Queen 's Park Oval , generally thought of as the most picturesque and largest of the old cricket grounds in the West Indies , as the most often used venue .
The cricket ground served as the country 's largest stadium until the new National Stadium was built in Mucurapo , Port of Spain , to host the nation 's athletics competitions and international football matches .
The stadium later was renovated and renamed after Hasely Crawford , the first person from Trinidad and Tobago to win an Olympic gold medal , prior to Trinidad and Tobago hosting the 2001 FIFA U-17 World Championship .
The stadium currently has a seating capacity of 23,000 and is owned by the Trinidad and Tobago government and managed through the Ministry of Sport via its special purpose state agency called SporTT .
In recent years , the TTFA have hosted matches at the smaller 10,000 seat Ato Boldon Stadium in Couva , citing a problem with the lighting system at Hasely Crawford Stadium , lower expenses for matches at Ato Boldon , and fans being seated closer to the pitch .
Trinidad and Tobago hosted two games during " The Hex " in late 2017 .
They lost to Honduras 1 - 2 on September 1 , 2017 .
On October 10 , 2017 , Trinidad and Tobago defeated the United States 2 - 1 , causing the United States to fail to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1986 .
Ato Boldon Stadium has since hosted friendlies against Grenada , Guyana , and Panama .
SUPPORTERS Section::::Supporters .
The major supporters ' group for the national team is the Soca Warriors Supporters Club or the Warrior Nation .
The group is a non - profit organisation that is independent of the Trinidad and Tobago Football Association .
Formed shortly after Trinidad and Tobago secured qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup , the supporters ' club was organised by Soca Warriors Online founder Inshan Mohammed and Nigel Myers .
The group 's activities include promoting teams locally and globally , lobbying the Trinidad and Tobago Football Association as representatives of football fans , advocating fair pricing and allocation of event tickets , organising travel for fans to home and away matches , providing a family - oriented fans ' organisation , and promoting football among the young people of Trinidad and Tobago .
