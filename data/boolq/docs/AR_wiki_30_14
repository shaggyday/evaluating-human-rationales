FART LIGHTING Fart lighting , also known as pyroflatulence or flatus ignition , is the practice of igniting the gases produced by human flatulence , often producing a flame of a blue hue , hence the act being known colloquially as a " blue angel " , " blue dart " , or in Australia , a " blue flame " .
The fact that flatus is flammable , and the actual combustion of it through this practice , gives rise to much humorous derivation .
Other colors of flame such as orange and yellow are possible with the color dependent on the mixture of gases formed in the colon .
In order to " fire fart " , one must have a fart prepared in the anal cavity , and a lighter at the ready .
Then they fart onto the lighter .
In 1999 , author Jim Dawson observed that fart lighting has been a novelty practice primarily among young men or college students for decades but is discouraged for its potential for causing injury .
Such experiments typically occur on camping trips and in single - sex group residences , such as tree - houses , dormitories , or fraternity houses .
With the advent of video sharing features online , hundreds of self - produced videos , both documentary as well as spoof , have been posted to sites such as YouTube .
The people appearing in the videos are predominantly young males .
In his book The Curse of the Self : Self - Awareness , Egotism , and the Quality of Human Life author Mark Richard Leary explains how a great deal of unhappiness is due to people 's inability to exert control over their thoughts and behavior and that " stupid stunts " , including lighting flatulence , were a way to make an impression and be included in group bonding or hazing .
Although there is little scientific discourse on the combustive properties of flatus , there are many anecdotal accounts of flatus ignition and the activity has increasingly found its way into popular culture with references in comic routines , movies , and television ; including cartoons .
In Electric Don Quixote : The Definitive Story of Frank Zappa author Neil Slaven quotes Frank Zappa for calling fart lighting " The manly art of fart - burning " , and another book quotes the musician Kenny Williams for saying that it demonstrates " compression , ignition , combustion and exhaust . "
There have been documented cases of flatulence during surgery being inadvertently ignited causing patient injury and the risk of death .
CHEMISTRY Section::::Chemistry .
The composition of flatus varies dramatically among individuals .
Flatulence produces a mixture of gases with the following six as major components : * carbon dioxide , * hydrogen , * hydrogen sulfide , * methane , * nitrogen , * oxygen .
Methane burns in oxygen forming water and carbon dioxide often producing a blue hue ( ΔH = −891 kJ / mol ) , as : Hydrogen sulfide also combusts ( ΔH = −519 kJ / mol ) to
The odor associated with flatus is due to hydrogen sulfide , skatole , indole , volatile amines and short - chain fatty acids .
These substances are detectable by olfactory neurons in concentrations as low as 10 parts per billion , hydrogen sulfide being the most detectable .
GAS PRODUCTION Section::::Gas production .
Some of the gases are produced by bacteria which live in symbiosis within the large intestines of humans and other mammals .
The gases are created as a by - product of the bacteria 's digestion of food into relatively simpler substances .
The oxygen and nitrogen component of flatus can be accounted for by aerophagy , while the CO component results from the reaction of stomach acids ( HCl ) with pancreatic bile ( NaHCO ) .
