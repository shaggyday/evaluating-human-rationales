PRIVATE ISLAND
A Private Island is a disconnected body of land wholly owned by a single private citizen or corporation .
Although this exclusivity gives the owner substantial control over the property , private islands remain under the jurisdiction of national and sometimes local governments .
OWNERSHIP Section::::Ownership .
Compared to property on the mainland , an island property has much more restricted access , both by potential trespassers and by the residents , who need to transport all supplies by boat or aircraft .
Livestock has often been kept on islands , because an island is a natural enclosure that prevents the escape of cattle and sheep .
There are many thousands of uninhabited islands in the world with potential for commercial development of tourist resorts or private recreational use .
Commercial development of uninhabited islands can raise ecological concerns , as many have a fragile environment .
Some islands can be bought undeveloped , while others already have roads and/or houses .
Islands are also available for rent .
Some celebrities have their own private islands .
There are widely varying government policies regarding private islands : for instance , islands off the coast of China , like any other land within the country , can not be purchased outright , but only leased from the government for a maximum period of 50 years .
Virtually all islands in the world are claimed and governed by some national government .
That nation 's laws apply , and any attempt by the owner to claim sovereignty would generally be unrealistic .
Nevertheless , some people still try to set up their own micronations on islands , like real - estate millionaire Michael Oliver 's attempt at building a libertarian city - state called the Republic of Minerva in the southern Pacific Ocean .
" Private " islands in the United Kingdom , Brazil , Chile and other countries are not legally entirely privateany foreshore , such as a beach , is owned by the state , and is hence publicly accessible property , despite what the owners of the land on the island may wish to claim .
The same applies to freedom to roam in Nordic countries : only the yard of a house and the immediate vicinity is legally protected against trespassing , and the water bodies around the island are freely navigable .
CRUISE LINES Section::::Cruise lines .
Since 1992 a number of cruise lines have acquired " private islands " to offer their customers exclusive beach experiences .
Such islands ( or sections thereof ) were further developed to have restaurants and perhaps additional attractions such as parasailing , waterparks , zip lines , horseback riding , spas and more .
Some islands have piers , others are reached by tender .
The purchase of an island allows the cruise line to achieve greater control over the venue and to influence the quality of experience of their passengers .
Certain private islands may be used not only by the cruise line that bought the property but also by associated lines .

The real estate market for private islands varies globally .
Prices tend to be lower in Nova Scotia , parts of Michigan and Maine , and parts of Central America ; and higher in Europe , the Bahamas , and Oceanic countries like French Polynesia .
Islands with amenities have higher market value and are not sold as frequently .
Some are available for travelers to rent , a trend which increased in the 2000s with economic recession making it more difficult for some owners to maintain them .
In the 2000s , the United States housing bubble increased the cost - per - acre for private islands .
The effect was fueled by the advent of the Internet , which provided greater access to island inventories .
Conservation groups ' efforts to restrict development reduced the supply of private islands in the market , raising prices .
Southeast Asia has numerous islands , with Indonesia being an archipelago of 17,000 islands and the Philippines having around 7,100 .
Real estate laws restrict foreigners ' ability to buy property in the geographical area , and many islands either have unclear ownership rights or are already settled .
Private islands that are available in Southeast Asia 's real estate market are also prohibitively costly due to being in high demand by hotel developers .
Developments address these difficulties by selling private islands that have villas and neighbor islands that have high - end hotels ; the proximity keeps costs of habitation down .
Europe has hundreds of thousands of islands many of which are privately owned .
With 17,000 islands in Finland , 221,831 islands in Sweden and thousands in Croatia , Europe is increasingly becoming a hotspot for private island holidays .
Many islands , although privately owned , are not suitable for development due to legal and governmental restrictions or due to the physical characteristics of the island .

Prominent among these is Weddell Island , one of the largest private islands in the world with a surface area of .
