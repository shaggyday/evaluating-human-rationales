PLOT Section::::Plot .
In 2006 , Dr. Kate Forrester ( Sandra Bullock ) is leaving a lake house that she has been renting in Madison , Wisconsin to move to Chicago .
Kate leaves a note in the mailbox for the next tenant to forward her mail , adding that the paint - embedded pawprints on the path leading to the house were already there when she arrived .
Two years earlier in 2004 , Alex Wyler ( Reeves ) , an architect , arrives at the lake house and finds Kate 's letter in the mailbox .
The house is neglected , with no sign of paw prints anywhere .
During the subsequent restoration of the house , a dog runs through Alex 's paint and leaves fresh paw prints
right where Kate said they would be .
Baffled , Alex writes back , asking how Kate knew about the paw prints since the house was unoccupied until he arrived .
On Valentine 's Day 2006 , Kate witnesses a traffic accident near Daley Plaza and tries to save the male victim , unsuccessfully .
She impulsively drives back to the lake house , finds Alex 's letter and writes back .
Both Alex and Kate continue passing messages to each other via the mailbox , and each watches its flag go up and down as the message leaves and the reply arrives as they wait at the mailbox .
They cautiously look around each time the flag changes , hoping to somehow spot the other .
It is in vain as they are alone at the mailbox .
They then discover that they are living exactly two years apart .
Their correspondence takes them through several events , including Alex finding a book , Jane Austen 's Persuasion , at a railway station where Kate said she would have lost it , and Alex taking Kate on a walking tour of his favorite places in Chicago via an annotated map that he leaves in the mailbox .
Alex eventually meets Kate at her boyfriend 's party but he does n't mention their exchange of letters to her because she did not " know " him at that time .
She later remembered the meeting as a vague memory in the past .
For Alex , the meeting happened in the present but for Kate , it had already taken place in the past without her knowing that it was Alex .
As Alex and Kate continue to write each other , they decide to try to meet again .
Alex makes a reservation at the Il Mare restaurant for March 2007 — two years into Alex 's future , but only a day away for Kate .
Kate goes to the restaurant but Alex fails to show .
Heartbroken , Kate asks Alex not to write her again , recounting the accident a year before .
Both Alex and Kate leave the lake house , continuing on with their separate lives .
On Valentine 's Day 2006 for Alex , Valentine 's Day 2008 for Kate , he returns to the lake house after something about the day triggers a memory .
Meanwhile , Kate goes to an architect to review the renovation plans for a house she wants to buy .
A drawing of the lake house on the conference room wall catches her attention and upon asking , Henry Wyler informs her
the artist was his brother , Alex , and Kate
realizes that this was the same Alex with whom she had been corresponding .
She also learns that Alex was killed in a traffic accident exactly two years ago to the day and realizes why he never showed up for their date - he was the man who died in Daley Plaza .
Rushing to the lake house , Kate frantically writes a letter telling Alex
she loves him , but begs him not to try to find her if he loves her back .
Wait two years , she says , and come to the lake house instead .
Meanwhile , Alex has gone to Daley Plaza to look for Kate .
At the lake house , Kate drops to her knees sobbing , fearing that she has arrived too late to stop Alex .
After a long pause , the mailbox flag finally lowers ; Alex has picked up her note .
Not long afterwards , a familiar mint - green truck pulls up .
She walks forward smiling as the driver , clad in jeans and a familiar tan jacket , approaches .
She and Alex kiss and walk toward the lake house .
