Section::::Casting and creation .
In February 2009 , Michael Ausiello hinted at the possibility of central character , Meredith Grey ( Ellen Pompeo ) , having another sibling .
The series had released a casting call for an actor who could pass as biracial ; casting was postponed until season six .
Williams 's casting was announced in late August 2009 .
Though his name is not given , the character 's arc was expected to last several episodes .
Williams described his audition as a " simple process . "
He got the information on his birthday , August 5 , and went in the next day to read for the role , despite not knowing what part he had auditioned for .
Williams learned he got the job a week later .
In late 2009 , a casting call for a young Ellis Grey ( Kate Burton ) and a young Richard Webber ( James Pickens , Jr. ) , who would appear in flashbacks , fueled rumors that Avery could be Meredith 's half - brother .
Williams later shot down the rumor , saying that Meredith would have noticed if her mother were pregnant .
Matt Webb Mitovich noted Williams 's absence from the " Seattle Grace : On Call " webseries as a sign of big plans for the character .
In the episode , " Perfect Little Accident , " which premiered on March 4 , 2010 , Avery is revealed to be the grandson of the legendary Harper Avery ( Chelcie Ross ) .
Shonda Rhimes hinted at the possibility of Williams and his co - star Sarah Drew becoming series regulars in her blog post about the season finale in May 2010 .
Williams 's promotion was eventually confirmed in June 2010 .
CHARACTERIZATION Section::::Characterization .
The character 's profile on official ABC website describes Avery as " hardworking , driven , observant " and " eager . "
However , at times , Avery can be too confident and " overly competitive , " and very " stubborn .
"
He has a habit of teasing his coworkers .
Williams revealed to Essence.com that his character is very " ambitious .
He does n't takes sides or deal with any drama .
He 's there to work and not really get involved in the pettiness . "
He describes the character as much more " cavalier , " and bold .
Matt Webb Mitovitch described Jackson as having a " sense of entitlement , " while Williams described Jackson 's demeanor as " swagger . "
Because his work environment is extremely competitive , Avery acts as if he belongs and refuses to second guess himself .
Upon arrival at Seattle Grace , he is " kind of a wise ass surgeon . "
He feels he is an " invader " in the new team and " he decides to deal with it kind of aggressively and not shy away from it and show his personality .
He is very confident and likes to say what is on his mind .
" Williams also said : " Jackson is more of a lone wolf .
He 's not really built to go seek support and a shoulder to cry on . "
" He 's always been trying to make it on his own .
Jackson does n't want to live off his legacy and his name , which also conflicts with him wanting to be close to his mother . "
RELATIONSHIPS Section::::Relationships .
Jackson immediately clashes with Cristina Yang ( Sandra Oh ) due their competitive natures .
The immediate tension between the duo leads to speculation about a potential romance .
Yang and Avery compete for the same cases , and in the episode , " Invest in Love , " for the first time , Jackson witnesses Cristina taking charge of a situation , and he admires her ; he looks at her differently .
At a party , when Jackson is a bit drunk , he opens up about how attractive he finds Cristina and kisses her .
Jackson is unaware of Yang 's relationship with Owen Hunt ( Kevin McKidd ) , so the attraction is natural .
Williams does not worry about fans of the couple hating his character because he understands that fans are n't really supposed to like the Mercy Westers ; Jackson is in the enemy camp and " has to take his lumps .
"
Williams said the kiss was a " pretty relatable crime of passion .
" The kiss does n't have any immediate effects on Owen and Cristina 's romance and it remains secret .
Jackson and Cristina develop a sort of mutual understanding as they tend to push one another to be better .
Speaking of Jackson 's past relationship with Lexie Grey , Williams said : " He tried to be safe and wise and not deal with girls , really , when he first focused on transitioning into Seattle Grace from Mercy West .
He kept his head down , got his work done and did n't get caught up with banging nurses or anything .
But he could n't help himself with Lexie once they got close ; he really kind of fell for her .
He made himself vulnerable probably to the least available person in the hospital , because he knew that she had a longstanding relationship with Mark .
He knew he should n't head in that direction , but he went against his better judgment and got burned for it . "
" They are both kind of suckers for love [ ... ]
they both get caught up in their own momentum [ ... ]
he 's all about his job and pressure from his grandfather but then he gets bowled over with this platonic relationship .
Avery just ca n't help himself with Lexie . "
At the end of the eighth season , April and Jackson 's friendship evolved into an intimate relationship : " I thought they were going to be able to walk the line of staying on the friendship side of things .
What they have is kind of really unique and organic in the world of Grey 's Anatomy ‚Äì two genders in a completely platonic , wholesome , pleasant and productive relationship / friendship .
Who is to say that has to end ?
" In the ninth season , Jackson started a relationship with intern Stephanie Edward .
Williams gave his insight : "
That 's a relationship that is fun , light , and no strings attached .
She 's sweet .
She 's funny .
They are n't bogged down by these big notions of each other .
Jackson later declares his love for April at her wedding to EMT Matthew .
They get married and have a child together , but he dies shortly after birth .
Distraught and searching for purpose , April turns to the army and goes on tour with Owen , leaving Jackson at Grey - Sloan Memorial .
After extending her leave several times , Jackson gives April an ultimatum that if she does not return immediately to Seattle , their relationship is over .
April does not immediately return , and when she finally does , Jackson feels that April does not respect his needs in the relationship , especially after losing a child .
The two try to make it work , but eventually come to the decision to end their marriage .
April discover she 's pregnant the day of their divorce proceedings , but does not disclose this until after the papers have been signed .
