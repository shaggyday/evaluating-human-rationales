DEMAND DEPOSIT Demand deposits , bank money or scriptural money are funds held in demand deposit accounts in commercial banks .
These account balances are usually considered money and form the greater part of the narrowly defined money supply of a country .
Simply put , these would be funds like those held in a checking account .
HISTORY Section::::History .
In the United States , demand deposits arose following the 1865 tax of 10 % on the issuance of state bank notes ; see history of banking in the USA .
In the U.S. , demand deposits only refer to funds held in checking accounts ( or cheque offering accounts ) other than NOW accounts ; however , in a 1970s and 1980s response to the 1933 promulgation of Regulation Q in the U.S. , demand deposits in some cases came to allow easier access to funds from other types of accounts ( e.g. savings accounts and money market accounts ) .
For the historical basis of the distinction between demand deposits and NOW accounts in the U.S. , see Negotiable order of withdrawal account#History .
MONEY SUPPLY Section::::Money supply .
Demand deposits are usually considered part of the narrowly defined money supply , as they can be used , via checks and drafts , as a means of payment for goods and services and to settle debts .
The money supply of a country is usually held to consist of currency plus demand deposits .
In most countries , demand deposits account for a majority of the money supply .
During times of financial crisis , bank customers will withdraw their funds in cash , leading to a drop in demand deposits and a shrinking of the money supply .
Economists have speculated that this effect contributed to the severity of the Great Depression .
This did not happen , however , in the financial crisis that began in 2008 .
In fact , demand deposits in the U.S. increased dramatically , from around $ 310bn in August 2008 to a peak of around $ 460bn in December 2008 .
