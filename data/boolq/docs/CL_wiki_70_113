UNITED STATES NAVAL ACADEMY CEMETERY
The United States Naval Academy Cemetery and Columbarium is a cemetery at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis , Maryland .
HISTORY Section::::History .
In 1868 the Naval Academy purchased a sixty - seven acre piece of land called Strawberry Hill as part of their efforts to expand after the American Civil War .
Within a year of its acquisition part of the property became the cemetery .
Since its beginning the cemetery has become the final resting place for Medal of Honor recipients , Superintendents of the Naval Academy , midshipmen , and former employees of the Academy and hundreds more of the nation 's veterans .
The cemetery is also home to monuments that do not mark remains , but commemorate the heroism of individuals who gave their life in service to their country .
The Jeannette Monument , erected in 1890 , is the most notable such monument .
It was built in memory of the men who lost their lives in the Jeannette Arctic Expedition .
COLUMBARIUM Section::::Columbarium .
In 1987 , the Naval Academy constructed a columbarium adjacent to the cemetery on College Creek .
The columbarium was built by the Naval Academy Alumni Association with $ 500,000 in gifts from alumni and friends of the Academy .
This included a major grant from the George and Carol Olmsted Foundation in memory of Jerauld L. Olmsted , Class of 1922 .
The columbarium offers resting places for those who wish to be inurned at the Naval Academy .
The columbarium is approximately 160 feet long and six feet high on a three - tiered pedestal .
All exterior surfaces are white marble .
Each niche front is removable by a special key .
