Section::::Development .
At the Television Critics Association winter press tour in January 2018 , The CW president Mark Pedowitz said he was " optimistic " and " confident " about Arrow and the other Arrowverse shows returning next season , but added that it was too soon to announce anything just yet .
On April 2 , The CW renewed the series for its fourth season .
Marc Guggenheim stepped down as co - showrunner at the end of the third season , with co - showrunner Phil Klemmer originally set to emerge as sole showrunner for the fourth season .
However , Keto Shimizu ultimately replaced Guggenheim as co - showrunner , to serve alongside Klemmer for this season .
Guggenheim , the series ' co - developer along with Klemmer , remains involved as an executive consultant .
WRITING Section::::Writing .
Phil Klemmer said that Mallus , the main antagonist of the third season , was " a sort of bellwether of bad guys to come in Season 4 " , which he said would go deep into the " world of fantastic myths and monsters " , without abandoning the time travel nature of the series .
He also said the season would further explore the Time Bureau , which was introduced in season three .
Klemmer added that at least one of the Legends would " break bad " in the season .
Tala Ashe , who joined the series as Zari Tomaz during the third season , said the fourth season would further explore the character 's backstory , in addition to the prejudice and xenophobia experienced by her .
Courtney Ford , who recurred in the third season as Damien Darhk 's daughter Nora , hoped the fourth season would explore what the character is without the influence of her father and Mallus .
