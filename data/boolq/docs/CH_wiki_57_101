FLATLINE
A flatline is an electrical time sequence measurement that shows no activity and therefore , when represented , shows a flat line instead of a moving one .
It almost always refers to either a flatlined electrocardiogram , where the heart shows no electrical activity ( asystole ) , or to a flat electroencephalogram , in which the brain shows no electrical activity ( brain death ) .
Both of these specific cases are involved in various definitions of death .
CARDIAC FLATLINE Section::::Cardiac flatline .
A cardiac flatline is also called asystole .
It can possibly be generated by malfunction of the electrocardiography device , but it is recommended to first rule out a true asystole because of the emergency of such condition .
When a patient displays a cardiac flatline , the treatment of choice is cardiopulmonary resuscitation and injection of vasopressin ( epinephrine and atropine are also possibilities ) .
Successful resuscitation is generally unlikely and is inversely related to the length of time spent attempting resuscitation .
Defibrillation is not recommended , despite commonly appearing on medical dramas as a remedy for asystole , but can be used for certain other causes of cardiac arrest .
