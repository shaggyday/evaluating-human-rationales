VANILLA SUGAR Vanilla sugar ( German : Vanillezucker , Polish : Cukier waniliowy ,
Hungarian : Vaníliás cukor , Swedish : " Vaniljsocker " , Macedonian : " Ванилин шеќер " ) is a commonly used ingredient of Dutch , German , Polish , Swedish , Finnish , Danish , Austrian , Norwegian , Hungarian , Czech , Slovak , Slovenian , Croatian , Bosnian , Serbian , Turkish and other European desserts .
Vanilla sugar is made of sugar and vanilla beans or sugar mixed with vanilla extract .
Pre - packaged vanilla sugar can be costly and difficult to obtain outside Europe but can be made at home .
Sometimes it can be replaced with vanilla extract , where one teaspoon equals one package .
However , when it is needed as a topping , vanilla extract is unsuitable .
Vanilla sugar can be prepared at home by combining approximately 2 cups of white sugar with the scraped seeds of one vanilla bean .
Alternatively , you can simply add 1 to 2 whole vanilla beans to an airtight jar containing 1 to 2 cups of white sugar ; let the mixture age for approximately 2 weeks then use 2 tablespoons in place of one packet of vanilla sugar ; continue to replace sugar as it is used and the beans will last indefinitely .
Cheaper vanilla sugar is also available , made only from sugar and vanillin .
