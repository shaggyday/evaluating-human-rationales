MASTOID ANTRUM
The mastoid antrum ( tympanic antrum , antrum mastoideum , Valsalva 's antrum ) is an air space in the petrous portion of the temporal bone , communicating posteriorly with the mastoid cells and anteriorly with the epitympanic recess of the middle ear via the aditus to mastoid antrum ( entrance to the mastoid antrum ) .
These air spaces function as sound receptors , provide voice resonance , act as acoustic insulation and dissipation , provide protection from physical damage and reduce the mass of the cranium .
The roof is formed by the tegmen antri which is a continuation of the tegmen tympani and separates it from the middle cranial fossa .
The lateral wall of the antrum is formed by a plate of bone which is an average of 1.5 cm in adults .
The mastoid air cell system is a major contributor to middle ear inflammatory diseases .
