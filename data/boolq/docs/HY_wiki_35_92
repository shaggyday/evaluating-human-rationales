PLOT Section::::Plot .
Former US Army Ranger Mike Banning ( Gerard Butler ) is the lead U.S. Secret Service agent assigned to head the U.S. Presidential detail .
Banning maintains a personal , friendly relationship with President Benjamin Asher ( Aaron Eckhart ) , First Lady Margaret ( Ashley Judd ) and their son Connor ( Finley Jacobsen ) .
During a snowy Christmas evening drive from Camp David to a campaign fundraiser , the car transporting the First Family spins out of control on a bridge due to icy conditions ; Banning pulls Asher from the vehicle , but fails to save Margaret as she falls to her death inside the car .
Eighteen months later , having been removed from the presidential detail , Banning works at Treasury headquarters .
During a meeting between Asher and South Korean Prime Minister Lee Tae - Woo ( Keong Sim ) at the White House , a North Korean terrorist organization , led by Kang Yeonsak ( Rick Yune ) , mounts an air and ground assault that results in the capture of the building .
The group is aided by treasonous members of the prime minister 's own detail , including Dave Forbes ( Dylan McDermott ) , a former Secret Service agent .
Asher and several top officials are held hostage in the White House bunker ; South Korean Prime Minister Lee is executed on live video .
Before his own death , detail agent Roma ( Cole Hauser ) alerts the Director of the Secret Service Lynne Jacobs ( Angela Bassett ) that " Olympus has fallen " .
Kang seeks to use Asher 's hostage status as leverage to force U.S. officials to withdraw the Seventh Fleet and U.S. forces from the Korean Peninsula , thus removing American opposition to a North Korean invasion of South Korea .
He also seeks to destroy the American nuclear weapons stockpile by detonating them in their respective silos across the country , turning the United States into an irradiated wasteland .
To accomplish this , he requires the access codes to a system called Cerberus , which are held by three top government officials , including the President , all of whom are inside the bunker .
Asher orders the other two officials to reveal their codes to save their lives , certain that he will not give up his code .
During the initial assault by Kang 's forces , Banning joins the White House 's defenders .
He falls back into the White House , disabling the internal surveillance and gaining access to Asher 's satellite ear phone , which he uses to maintain contact with Jacobs and Speaker of the House Allan Trumbull ( Morgan Freeman ) , now the Acting President .
Authorized to proceed , Banning 's first act is to save the President 's son Connor , whom Kang plans to use to force Asher to reveal his Cerberus code .
Banning finds Connor hiding in the building 's walls and sneaks the boy to safety .
Banning then begins reconnaissance , during which he kills several of the terrorists , including Forbes .
Meanwhile , Army Chief of Staff General Edward Clegg ( Robert Forster ) convinces Trumbull to order an aerial SEAL assault on the White House .
Kang discovers the assault force and activates the Hydra 6 , an advanced anti - aircraft system built by the military .
Discovering the system , Banning advises Trumbull and Clegg to abort the mission , but the new weapon system annihilates most of the assault force before Banning can stop it .
Kang retaliates for the infiltration by killing Vice President Charlie Rodriguez ( Phil Austin ) .
After Banning disables Kang 's communications , Kang tries to execute Secretary of Defense Ruth McMillan ( Melissa Leo ) outside the White House in front of the media , but Banning rescues her .
With his forces dwindling , Kang fakes his and Asher 's death by sacrificing several of his men and the remaining hostages .
However , Banning sees through the ruse .
Kang eventually cracks Asher 's code using brute - force attack and activates Cerberus .
As Kang and his remaining men attempt to escape , Banning ambushes them and kills the remaining terrorists .
During the fight , Asher tries to break free from Kang 's grip and is subsequently shot by him in the stomach .
Banning and Kang confront each other and a climactic fight breaks out , in which Kang quickly gains the upper hand .
Eventually , Banning kills Kang by stabbing him in the head with a knife and disables Cerberus with the assistance of Trumbull and his staff , with only seconds to spare .
During daybreak , Banning walks out with Asher and is received by the soldiers posted to await their arrival .
After the events , the United States begins to heal from the attack , while Banning once again heads the president 's security detail .

Olympus
Has Fallen was directed by Antoine Fuqua , based on a script by Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt in their first screenwriting effort .
The production company Millennium Films acquired the spec script in March 2012 , and Gerard Butler was cast later in the month as the star .
The rest of the characters were cast throughout June and July .
In 2012 , Millennium Films competed against Sony Pictures , which was producing White House Down ( also about a takeover of the White House ) to complete casting and to begin filming .
Filming began in Shreveport , Louisiana , in mid - July 2012 .
Because Olympus Has Fallen was filmed so far from its actual setting of Washington , D.C. , the entire production relied heavily upon visual effects , particularly computer - generated imagery .
For example , computers were used to create nearly all of the opening sequence in which the First Lady is killed in a car accident , with chroma key greenscreen technology used to composite the actors into the computer - generated snowy scenery .
For scenes where actors walked in or out of the White House , a first - floor fa√ßade and entrance were built ; computers added the second floor , roof , and downtown D.C. cityscape .
Action scenes with the White House in the background were filmed in open fields and the White House and D.C. were added in post - production .
