INDIA NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM
The India national football team represents India in international football and is controlled by the All India Football Federation .
Under the global jurisdiction of FIFA and governed in Asia by the AFC , the team is also part of the South Asian Football Federation .
The team , which was once considered one of the best teams in Asia , had its golden era during the 1950s and early 1960s .
During this period , under the coaching of Syed Abdul Rahim , India won gold during the 1951 and 1962 Asian Games , while finishing fourth during the 1956 Summer Olympics .
India has never participated in the FIFA World Cup , although the team did qualify by default for the 1950 World Cup after all the other nations in their qualification group withdrew .
However , India withdrew prior to the beginning of the tournament .
The team has also appeared three times in the Asia 's top football competition , the AFC Asian Cup .
Their best result in the competition occurred in 1964 when the team finished as runners - up .
India also participate in the SAFF Championship , the top regional football competition in South Asia .
They have won the tournament six times since it began in 1993 .
Despite India not achieving the same results as their golden era , the team has seen a steady resurgence since the beginning of the 21st century .
Besides the SAFF Championship triumphs , under the guidance of Bob Houghton , India won the restarted Nehru Cup in 2007 and 2009 while also managing to emerge victorious during the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup .
The Challenge Cup victory allowed India to once again qualify for the Asian Cup for the first time in 27 years .
The national team 's all - time top goalscorer is Sunil Chhetri , with 65 goals .
Chhetri is also India 's most - capped player , with 103 international appearances .
HISTORY EARLY YEARS Section::::History .
Section::::Early years .
Football teams consisting of entirely Indian players started to tour Australia , Japan , Indonesia , and Thailand during the late 1930s .
After the success of several Indian football clubs abroad , the All India Football Federation ( AIFF ) was formed in 1937 .
The national team played their first match as an independent nation in 1948 in the first round of the 1948 Summer Olympics against France .
Using mainly barefooted players , India were defeated 2–1 in London .
GOLDEN YEARS
( 1950S–1960S ) Section::::Golden years ( 1950s–1960s ) .
In 1950 , India managed to qualify for the 1950 FIFA World Cup , which was scheduled to take place in Brazil .
This was due to all their opponents during qualifying withdrawing from the pre - tournament qualifiers .
However , India themselves withdrew from the World Cup before the tournament was to begin .
The All India Football Federation gave various reasons for the team 's withdrawal , including travel costs , lack of practice time , and valuing the Olympics more than the World Cup .
Despite the reason given out from the AIFF , many historians and pundits believe India withdrew from the World Cup due to FIFA imposing a rule banning players from playing barefoot .
However , according to the then captain of India , Sailen Manna , the story of the team not being allowed to play due to wanting to play barefoot was not true and was just an excuse to cover up the real reasons the AIFF decided not to travel to Brazil .
Since then , India has not come close to qualifying for another World Cup .
Despite not participating in the World Cup in 1950 , the following years after , from 1951 to 1964 , are usually considered to be the " golden era " of Indian football .
India , coached by Hyderabad City Police head coach Syed Abdul Rahim , became one of the best teams in Asia .
In March 1951 , Rahim lead India to their first ever triumph during the 1951 Asian Games .
Hosted in India , the team defeated Iran 1–0 in the gold medal match to gain their first trophy .
Sahu Mewalal scored the winning goal for India in that match .
The next year India went back to the Olympics but were once again defeated in the first round , this time by Yugoslavia and by a score of 10–1 .
Upon returning to India , the AIFF made it mandatory for footballers to wear boots .
After taking the defeat in Finland , India participated in various minor tournaments , such as the Colombo Cup , which they won three times from 1953 to 1955 .
In 1954 , India returned to the Asian Games as defending champions in Manila .
Despite their achievement three years prior , India were unable to go past the group stage as the team finished second in Group C during the tournament , two points behind Indonesia .
Two years later , during the 1956 Summer Olympics , India went on to achieve the team 's greatest result in a competitive tournament .
The team finished in fourth place during the Summer Olympics football tournament , losing the bronze - medal match to Bulgaria 3–0 .
The tournament is also known for Neville D'Souza 's hat - trick against Australia in the quarterfinals .
D'Souza 's hat - trick was the first hat - trick scored by an Asian in Olympic history .
After their good performance during the Summer Olympics , India participated in the 1958 Asian Games in Tokyo .
The team once again finished fourth , losing the bronze - medal match to Indonesia 4–1 .
The next year the team traveled to Malaysia where they took part in the Merdeka Cup and finished as the tournament runners - up .
India began the 1960s with 1960 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers .
Despite the qualifiers for the West Zone being held in Kochi , India finished last in their qualification group and thus failed to qualify for the tournament .
Despite the set - back , India went on to win the gold medal during the Asian Games for the second time in 1962 .
The team defeated South Korea 2–1 to win their second major championship .
Two years later , following their Asian Games triumph , India participated in the 1964 AFC Asian Cup after all the other teams in their qualification group withdrew .
Despite their automatic entry into the continental tournament , India managed to finish as the runners - up during the tournament , losing out to the hosts , Israel , by two points .
This remains India 's best performance in the AFC Asian Cup .
DECLINE ( 1970S–2000 ) Section::::Decline ( 1970s–2000 ) .
India returned to the Asian Games in 1966 .
Despite their performance two years prior during the AFC Asian Cup , India could not go beyond the group stage as the team finished third , behind Japan and Iran .
Four years later , during the 1970 Asian Games , India came back and took third place during the tournament .
The team defeated Japan 1–0 during the bronze - medal match .
In 1974 , India 's performance in the Asian Games once again sharply declined as they finished the 1974 edition in last place in their group , losing all three matches , scoring two , and conceding 14 goals in the first round .
India then showed steady improvement during the 1978 tournament , finishing second in their group of three .
The team were then knocked - out in the next round , finishing last in their group with three defeats from three matches .
The 1982 tournament proved to be better for India as the side managed to qualify for the quarter - finals before losing to Saudi Arabia 1–0 .
In 1984 , India managed to qualify for the AFC Asian Cup for the first time since their second place triumph in 1964 .
During the 1984 tournament , India finished in last place in their five team group in the first round .
India 's only non - defeat during the tournament came against Iran , a 0–0 draw .
Despite India 's decline from a major football power in Asia , the team still managed to assert its dominance as the top team in South Asia .
India managed to win the football competition of the South Asian Games in 1985 and then again won the gold medal in 1987 .
The team then began the 1990s by winning the inaugural SAFF Championship in 1993 .
The team ended the 20th century by winning the SAFF Championship again in 1997 and 1999 .
RESURGENCE ( 2000–2011 )
Section::::Resurgence ( 2000–2011 ) .
India 's first competitive matches of the 21st century were the 2002 FIFA World Cup first round qualifiers .
Despite a very bright start , defeating the United Arab Emirates 1–0 , drawing Yemen 1–1 , as well as two victories over Brunei , including a 5–0 victory in Bangalore , India finished a point away from qualification for the next round .
In 2003 , India took part in the 2003 SAFF Championship .
The team qualified for the semi - finals but fell to Bangladesh 2–1 .
Later in 2003 , India participated in the Afro - Asian Games being held in Hyderabad .
Under the coaching of Stephen Constantine , India managed to make it to the final of the tournament after defeating Zimbabwe , a team ranked 85 places above India in the FIFA rankings at the time , 5–3 .
Despite the major victory , during the gold - medal match India were defeated 1–0 by Uzbekistan U21 .
Due to this achievement , Constantine was voted as the Asian Football Confederation 's Manager of the Month for October 2003 .
The tournament result also gave India more recognition around the country and around the world .
Constantine was replaced by Syed Nayeemuddin in 2005 but the Indian head coach only lasted for a little over a year as India suffered many heavy defeats during the 2007 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers .
During this time India were defeated 6–0 by Japan , 3–0 by Saudi Arabia and Yemen respectively at home , and 7–1 away in Jeddah .
Former Malmö and China coach Bob Houghton was brought in as head coach in May 2006 .
Under Houghton , India witnessed massive improvement in their football standing .
In August 2007 , Houghton won the country the restarted Nehru Cup after India defeated Syria 1–0 in the final .
Pappachen Pradeep scored the winning goal for India that match .
The next year , Houghton lead India during the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup , which was hosted in Hyderabad and Delhi .
During the tournament , India breezed through the group stage before defeating Myanmar in the semi - finals .
In the final against Tajikistan , India , through a Sunil Chhetri hat - trick , won the match 4–1 .
The victory not only earned India the championship but it also allowed India to qualify for the 2011 AFC Asian Cup , the nation 's first Asian Cup appearance in 27 years .
In order to prepare for the Asian Cup , Houghton had the team stay together as a squad for eight months from June 2010 till the start of the tournament , meaning the players would not play for their clubs .
India were drawn into Group C for the Asian Cup with Australia , South Korea , and Bahrain .
Despite staying together as a team for eight months , India lost all three of their matches during the Asian Cup , including a 4–0 defeat to Australia .
Despite the results , India were still praised by fans and pundits for their valiant efforts during the tournament .
2011–PRESENT
Section::::2011–present .
After participating the 2011 AFC Asian Cup , India 's camaign to qualify for the 2015 Asian Cup began in February 2011 with the AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers .
Bob Houghton decided to change the makeup of the India squad , replacing many of the aging players from the Asian Cup with some young players from the AIFF development side in the I - League , Indian Arrows .
Even with a young side , India managed to qualify for the AFC Challenge Cup .
Despite successfully qualifying for the AFC Challenge Cup , the AIFF decided to terminate the contract of Bob Houghton .
After having Dempo coach , Armando Colaco , as interim head coach , the AIFF signed Savio Medeira as head coach in October 2011 .
Despite leading India to another SAFF Championship victory , Medeira lead India to their worst performance in the AFC Challenge Cup in March 2012 .
The team lost all three of their group matches , unable to score a single goal during the tournament .
After the tournament , Medeira was replaced as head coach by Dutchman , Wim Koevermans .
Koeverman 's first job as head coach was the 2012 Nehru Cup .
India won their third successive Nehru Cup , defeating Cameroon 's B side on penalties .
In March 2013 , India failed to qualify for the 2014 AFC Challenge Cup and thus also failed to qualify for the 2015 AFC Asian Cup .
The team also failed to retain the SAFF Championship , losing 2–0 to Afghanistan in the 2013 final .
After more bad results in friendlies , Koevermans resigned as head coach in October 2014 .
By March 2015 , after not playing any matches , India reached their lowest FIFA ranking position of 173 .
A couple months prior , Stephen Constantine was re - hired as the head coach after first leading India more than a decade before .
Constantine 's first major assignment back as the India head coach were the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers .
After making it through the first round of qualifiers , India crashed out during the second round , losing seven of their eight matches and thus , once again , failed to qualify for the World Cup .
Despite failure to qualify for the World Cup , India managed to reach the third round of 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers after defeating Laos in the play - off round on aggregate 7–1 .
On 11 October 2017 , India secured qualification for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup after a 4–1 victory over Macau .
KIT AND COLOURS Section::::Kit and colours .
The India national team plays in blue , the colour of the Ashoka Chakra on the Indian flag .
The other colours on the flag , saffron , white , and India green , were deemed too controversial to be used as the main colour , as jerseys with saffron and green are often used by neighbouring countries .
Blue as the national colour for India was soon made more prominant due to the success of the India cricket team and field hockey teams .
The football team , however , has used some sort of shade of blue for decades .
At the turn of the 21st century , India wore a sky blue shirt with black pants and sky blue socks as their kit .
In 2002 , the All India Football Federation signed a deal with German manufacturer Adidas to produce the India kit .
The first kit made by Adidas was all - white .
After four years with Adidas , the AIFF signed an agreement with American company Nike on 27 February 2006 .
The deal was for seven years .
Nike 's first kits for India were in darker blue while the away kit was changed from white to orange .
For the 2011 AFC Asian Cup , in which India were participating , Nike designed India 's kit using the same template it used for other national teams such as Brazil .
In January 2013 .
it was announced that the AIFF 's deal with Nike was extended for an extra five years .
In September 2017 , prior to the India U17 side 's participation in the FIFA U-17 World Cup , Nike unveiled an all sky blue kit for the India senior and youth teams .
The Nike deal ended in December 2018 , and AIFF signed a 5 years deal with Six5Six to be the new official kit sponsor .
The new jerseys for 2019 AFC Asian Cup were unveiled in December 2018 , the home colour have the similar sky blue shades and
the away colour is changed to white from orange but both the jerseys have new design embellished on the sleeves representing tiger stripes to pay homage to the Indian football fans , who affectionately calls the team Blue Tigers , where as the goalkeeper 's jersey replaced the light green to orange colour with the same sleeves design .
HOME STADIUMS Section::::Home stadiums .

In June 2018 , supporters filled the Mumbai Football Arena for India 's Intercontinental Cup match against Kenya after a plea from India 's captain Sunil Chhetri went viral on social media .

Section::::Competitive record .
Section::::FIFA World Cup .
India has never participated in a FIFA World Cup .
After gaining independence in 1947 , India managed to qualify for the World Cup held in 1950 .
This was due to Myanmar , Indonesia , and the Philippines withdrawing from qualification .
However , prior to the start of the tournament , India themselves withdrew due to the expenses required in getting the team to Brazil .
Other reasons cited for why India withdrew include FIFA not allowing Indian players to play in the tournament barefoot and the All India Football Federation not considering the World Cup an important tournament compared to the Olympics .
After withdrawing from the 1950 FIFA World Cup , India did n't enter the qualifying rounds of the tournament between 1954 and 1982 .
Since the 1986 qualifiers , with the exception of the 1990 edition of the tournament , the team started to participate in qualifiers but have yet to qualify for the tournament again . !
