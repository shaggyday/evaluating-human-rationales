DOTHRAKI LANGUAGE
The Dothraki language is a constructed fictional language in George R. R. Martin 's fantasy novel series A Song of Ice and Fire and its television adaptation Game of Thrones , where it is spoken by the Dothraki , nomadic inhabitants of the Dothraki Sea .
The language was developed for the TV series by the linguist David J. Peterson , working off the Dothraki words and phrases in Martin 's novels . , the language comprised 3163 words , not all of which have been made public .
In 2012 , 146 newborn girls in the United States were named " Khaleesi " , the Dothraki term for the wife of a khal or ruler , and the title adopted in the series by Daenerys Targaryen .
Dothraki and Valyrian have been described as " the most convincing fictional tongues since Elvish " .
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Development .
The Dothraki vocabulary was created by David J. Peterson well in advance of the adaptation .
HBO hired the Language Creation Society to create the language , and after an application process involving over thirty conlangers , David Peterson was chosen to develop the Dothraki language .
He delivered over 1700 words to HBO before the initial shooting .
Peterson drew inspiration from George R. R. Martin 's description of the language , as well as from such languages as Turkish , Russian , Estonian , Inuktitut and Swahili .
David J. Peterson and his development of the Dothraki language were featured on an April 8 , 2012 episode of CNN 's The Next List .
He went on to create the Valyrian languages for season 3 of Game of Thrones .
Peterson and his development of Dothraki were also featured on the January 8 , 2017 episode of To Tell the Truth .
LANGUAGE CONSTRAINTS Section::::Language constraints .
The Dothraki language was developed under two significant constraints .
First , the language had to match the uses already put down in the books .
Secondly , it had to be easily pronounceable or learnable by the actors .
These two constraints influenced the grammar and phonology of the language : for instance , as in English , there is no contrast between aspirated and unaspirated stops .
PHONOLOGY AND ROMANIZATION Section::::Phonology and romanization .
David Peterson has said , " You know , most people probably do n't really know what Arabic actually sounds like , so to an untrained ear , it might sound like Arabic .
To someone who knows Arabic , it does n't .
I tend to think of the sound as a mix between Arabic ( minus the distinctive pharyngeals ) and Spanish , due to the dental consonants . "
Regarding the orthography , the Dothraki themselves do not have a writing system — nor do many of the surrounding peoples ( e.g. the Lhazareen ) .
If there were to be any written examples of Dothraki in the A Song of Ice and Fire universe , it would be in a writing system developed in the Free Cities and adapted to Dothraki , or in some place like Ghis or Qarth , which do have writing systems .
CONSONANTS Section::::Consonants .
There are twenty - three consonant phonemes in the Dothraki language .

The letters c and x never appear in Dothraki , although c appears in the digraph ch .
b and p seem to appear only in names , as in Bharbo and Pono .
These consonants were used in the past but have since developed into [ f ] and [ v ] .
They can still be used as variants of [ f ] and [ v ] .
Voiceless stops may be aspirated .
This does not change word meaning .
The geminates of consonants marked with digraphs have a reduced orthography :
* kkh is pronounced ( not )
* tth is pronounced ( not )
* ssh is pronounced ( not )
* zzh is pronounced ( not )
* cch is pronounced ( not ) VOWELS Section::::Vowels .
Dothraki has a four vowel system shown below : !
Vowels
There are no diphthongs .
In the A Song of Ice and Fire books , u never occurs as a vowel , appearing only after q , and only in names , as in Jhiqui and Quaro .
In sequence of multiple vowels , each such vowel represents a separate syllable .
Examples : shierak - star , rhaesh - country , khaleesi - queen .
The vowels /i , e , o , a/ turn into [ e , ɛ , ɔ , ɑ ] after /q/.
/o/ turns into [ ɤ ] after dental consonants .
/o/ can be pronounced as [ u ] after [ g ] , [ k ] and [ x ] .
GRAMMAR PARTS OF SPEECH
Section::::Grammar .
Section::::Parts of speech .
Though prepositions are also sometimes employed , the language is foremost inflectional .
Prefixes , suffixes and circumfixes are all used .
Verbs conjugate in infinitive , past , present , future , two imperatives and ( archaic ) participle ; they also agree with person , number and polarity .
Nouns divide into two classes , inanimate and animate .
They decline in five cases , nominative , accusative , genitive , allative and ablative .
Animate nouns also decline according to number .
WORD ORDER Section::::Word order .
Basic word order is SVO ( subject – verb – object ) .
In a basic sentence , the order of these elements ( when all three are present ) is as in English :
First comes the subject ( S ) , then comes the verb ( V ) , then comes the object ( O ) .
When only a subject is present , the subject precedes the verb , as it does in English :
In noun phrases there is a specific order as well .
The order is as follows : demonstrative , noun , adverb , adjective , genitive noun , prepositional phrase .
Prepositions always precede their noun complements .
but adjectives , possessor and prepositional phrases all follow the noun :
Adverbs normally are sentence final , but they can also immediately follow the verb .
Modal particles precede the verb .
In the episode " Andy 's Ancestry " from the United States television show The Office , Dwight Schrute created the Dothraki phrase
" throat rip " by placing " throat " in front to make it the accusative .
David J. Peterson adapted that language technique and called it the " Schrutean compound " .
