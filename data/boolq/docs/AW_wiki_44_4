GREATER ANTILLES
The Greater Antilles is a grouping of the larger islands in the Caribbean Sea : Cuba , Hispaniola ( containing Haiti and the Dominican Republic ) , Puerto Rico , Jamaica , and the Cayman Islands .
The Greater Antilles constitute nearly 90 % of the land mass of the entire West Indies , as well as over 90 % of its population .
The remainder of the land belongs to the archipelago of the Lesser Antilles , which is a chain of islands to the east ( running north - south and encompassing the eastern edge of the Caribbean Sea where it meets the Atlantic Ocean ) and south ( running east - west off the northern coast of South America ) .
The word Antilles originated in the period before the European conquest of the New World - Europeans used the term Antillia as one of the mysterious lands featured on medieval charts , sometimes as an archipelago , sometimes as continuous land of greater or lesser extent , its location fluctuating in mid - ocean between the Canary Islands and Eurasia .
The Lucayan Archipelago is not considered to be a part of the Antilles archipelagoes but rather of the North Atlantic .
