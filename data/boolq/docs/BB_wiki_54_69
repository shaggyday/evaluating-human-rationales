PLOT Section::::Plot .
The novel begins with a note from the author , which is an integral part of it .
Unusually , the note describes entirely fictional events .
It serves to establish and enforce one of the book 's main themes : the relativity of truth .
Life of Pi is subdivided into three sections :
PART
ONE Section::::Part one .
In the first section , the main character , by the name of Piscine Patel , an adult Canadian , reminisces about his childhood in India .
His father owns a zoo in Pondicherry .
The livelihood provides the family with a relatively affluent lifestyle and some understanding of animal psychology .
The narrator describes how he acquired his full name , Piscine Molitor Patel , as a tribute to the swimming pool in France .
After hearing schoolmates tease him by transforming the first name into " Pissing " , he establishes the short form of his name as " Pi " when he starts secondary school .
The name , he says , pays tribute to the transcendental number which is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter .
In recounting his experiences , Pi describes several other unusual situations involving proper names : two visitors to the zoo , one a devout Muslim , and the other a committed atheist , bear identical names ; and a 450-pound tiger at the zoo bears the name Richard Parker as the result of a clerical error , in which human and animal names were reversed .
Pi is raised as a Hindu who practices vegetarianism .
At the age of fourteen , he investigates Christianity and Islam , and decides to become an adherent of all three religions , much to his parents ' dismay , saying he " just wants to love God . "
He tries to understand God through the lens of each religion , and comes to recognize benefits in each one .
A few years later in February 1976 , during the period when Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declares " The Emergency " , Pi 's father decides to sell the zoo and immigrate with his wife and sons to Canada .
PART
TWO Section::::Part two .
The second part of the novel begins with Pi 's family aboard the Tsimtsum , a Japanese freighter that is transporting animals from their zoo to North America .
A few days out of port from Manila , the ship encounters a storm and sinks .
Pi manages to escape in a small lifeboat , only to learn that the boat also holds a spotted hyena , an injured Grant 's zebra , and an orangutan named Orange Juice .
Much to the boy 's distress , the hyena kills the zebra and then Orange Juice .
A tiger has been hiding under the boat 's tarpaulin : it 's Richard Parker , who had boarded the lifeboat with ambivalent assistance from Pi himself some time before the hyena attack .
Suddenly emerging from his hideaway , Richard Parker kills and eats the hyena .
Frightened , Pi constructs a small raft out of rescue flotation devices , tethers it to the bow of the boat and makes it his place of retirement .
He begins conditioning Richard Parker to take a submissive role by using food as a positive reinforcer , and seasickness as a punishment mechanism , while using a whistle for signals .
Soon , Pi asserts himself as the alpha animal , and is eventually able to share the boat with his feline companion , admitting in the end that Richard Parker is the one who helped him survive his ordeal .
Pi recounts various events while adrift in the Pacific Ocean .
At his lowest point , exposure renders him blind and unable to catch fish .
In a state of delirium , he talks with a marine " echo " , which he initially identifies as Richard Parker having gained the ability to speak , but it turns out to be another blind castaway , a Frenchman , who boards the lifeboat with the intention of killing and eating Pi , but is immediately killed by Richard Parker .
Some time later , Pi 's boat comes ashore on a floating island network of algae and inhabited by hundreds of thousands of meerkats .
Soon , Pi and Richard Parker regain strength , but the boy 's discovery of the carnivorous nature of the island 's plant life forces him to return to the ocean .
Two hundred and twenty - seven days after the ship 's sinking , the lifeboat washes onto a beach in Mexico , after which Richard Parker disappears into the nearby jungle without looking back , leaving Pi heartbroken at the abrupt farewell .
PART
THREE Section::::Part three .
The third part of the novel describes a conversation between Pi and two officials from the Japanese Ministry of Transport , who are conducting an inquiry into the shipwreck .
They meet him at the hospital in Mexico where he is recovering .
Pi tells them his tale , but the officials reject it as unbelievable .
Pi then offers them a second story in which he is adrift on a lifeboat not with zoo animals , but with the ship 's cook , a Taiwanese sailor with a broken leg , and his own mother .
The cook amputates the sailor 's leg for use as fishing bait , then kills the sailor himself as well as Pi 's mother for food , and soon he is killed by Pi , who dines on him .
The investigators note parallels between the two stories .
They soon conclude that the hyena symbolizes the cook , the zebra the sailor , the orangutan Pi 's mother , and the tiger represents Pi .
Pi points out that neither story can be proven and neither explains the cause of the shipwreck , so he asks the officials which story they prefer : the one without animals or the one with animals .
They eventually choose the story with the animals .
Pi thanks them and says : "
And so it goes with God .
"
The investigators then leave and file a report .
MAJOR
THEMES LIFE IS A STORY Section::::Major themes .
Section::::Life is a story .
Life of Pi , according to Yann Martel , can be summarized in three statements : " Life is a story ...
You can choose your story ...
A story with God is the better story . "
A recurring theme throughout the novel seems to be believability .
Pi at the end of the book asks the two investigators " If you stumble at mere believability , what are you living for ? "
According to Gordon Houser there are two main themes of the book : " that all life is interdependent , and that we live and breathe via belief . "
GROWTH THROUGH ADVERSITY Section::::Growth through adversity .
PBS has described Martel 's story as one of " personal growth through adversity .
" The main character learns that " tigers are dangerous " at a young age when his father forces him to watch the zoo 's Royal Bengal tiger patriarch , Mahisha , devour a live goat .
Later , after he has been reduced to eking out a desperate existence on the lifeboat with the company of a fully grown tiger , Pi develops " alpha " qualities as he musters the strength , will and skills he needs to survive .
INSPIRATION
Section::::Inspiration .
In a 2002 interview with PBS , Martel said " I was sort of looking for a story , not only with a small 's ' but sort of with a capital 'S ' – something that would direct my life . "
He spoke of being lonely and needing direction in his life , and found that writing the novel met this need .
RICHARD PARKER AND SHIPWRECK NARRATIVES Section::::Richard Parker and shipwreck narratives .
The name of Martel 's tiger , Richard Parker , was inspired by a character in Edgar Allan Poe 's nautical adventure novel
The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket ( 1838 ) .
In this book , Richard Parker is a mutineer who is stranded and eventually cannibalized on the hull of an overturned ship ( and there is a dog aboard who is named Tiger ) .
The author also had in mind another occurrence of the name , in the famous legal case R v Dudley and Stephens ( 1884 ) where a shipwreck again results in the cannibalism of a cabin boy named Richard Parker , this time in a lifeboat .
A third Richard Parker drowned in the sinking of the Francis Spaight in 1846 , described by author Jack London , and later the cabin boy ( not Richard Parker ) was cannibalized .
Having read about these events , Yann Martel thought , " So many victimized Richard Parkers had to mean something . "
MOACYR SCLIAR Section::::Moacyr Scliar .
Martel has mentioned that a book review he read of Brazilian author Moacyr Scliar 's 1981 novella Max and the Cats accounts in part for his novel 's premise .
Scliar 's story describes a Jewish - German refugee crossing the Atlantic Ocean with a jaguar in his boat .
Scliar said that he was perplexed that Martel " used the idea without consulting or even informing me , " and indicated that he was reviewing the situation before deciding whether to take any action in response .
After talking with Martel , Scliar elected not to pursue the matter .
A dedication to Scliar " for the spark of life " appears in the author 's note of Life of Pi .
Literary reviews have described the similarities between Life of Pi and Max and the Cats as superficial .
Reviewer Peter Yan wrote : " Reading the two books side - by - side , one realizes how inadequate bald plot summaries are in conveying the unique imaginative impact of each book , " and noted that Martel 's distinctive narrative structure is not found in Scliar 's novella .
The themes of the books are also dissimilar , with Max and the Cats being an allegory for Nazism .
In Life of Pi , 211 of 354 pages are devoted to Pi 's experience in the lifeboat , compared to Max and the Cats , in which 17 of its 99 pages depict time spent in a lifeboat .
NARRATIVE STRUCTURE Section::::Narrative structure .
According to the reviewer Peter Yan , ' Life of Pi ' is told from two alternating points of view , the main character Pi in a flashback and Yann Martel himself , who is the " visiting writer " ( Martel 101 ) interviewing Pi many years after the tiger in the boat story .
This technique of the intrusive narrator adds the documentary realism to the book , setting up , like a musical counter - point , the myth - making , unreliable narrator , Pi .
The reader is left to ponder at the end whether Pi 's story is an allegory of another set of parallel events .
SETTING
Section::::Setting .
The novel is a work of fiction set in the summer of 1977 that draws on places and historical events in India .
The Patel Family 's discussions of the political situation refer to the Emergency period of the mid-1970s , when Indira Gandhi 's administration ruled by decree , curtailed press freedoms , and imprisoned political opponents .
Pondicherry is a former French colony in India .
It does have an Indian Coffee House and Botanical Gardens .
The Botanical Garden had a zoo in 1977 but did not have any animals bigger than a deer .
Munnar , the destination for the Patel family 's vacation , is a small but popular hill station in Kerala .
Madurai , also referenced in the novel , is a popular tourist and pilgrimage site in Tamil Nadu .
CHARACTERS PISCINE MOLITOR " PI " PATEL Section::::Characters .
Section::::Piscine Molitor " Pi " Patel .
Piscine Molitor Patel , known to all as just " Pi " , is the narrator and protagonist of the novel .
He was named after a swimming pool in Paris , despite the fact that neither his mother nor his father particularly liked swimming .
The story is told as a narrative from the perspective of a middle - aged Pi , now married with his own family , and living in Canada .
At the time of main events of the story , he is sixteen years old .
He recounts the story of his life and his 227-day journey on a lifeboat when his ship sinks in the middle of the Pacific Ocean during a voyage to North America .
RICHARD PARKER Section::::Richard Parker .
Richard Parker is a royal Bengal tiger who is stranded on the lifeboat with Pi when the ship sinks .
Richard Parker lives on the lifeboat with Pi and is kept alive with the food and water Pi delivers .
Richard Parker develops a relationship with Pi that allows them to coexist in their struggle .
In the novel , a hunter named Richard Parker is hired to kill a panther thought to have killed seven people within two months .
Instead , he accidentally immobilizes a female Bengal tiger with tranquilizer darts while her cub escapes hiding in a bush .
Parker names the cub Thirsty after his enthusiasm when drinking from a nearby river .
The paperwork that accompanies the shipment of the two tigers to Pi 's family 's zoo in Pondicherry states that the cub 's name is " Richard Parker " and the hunter 's given name is " Thirsty " and his surname is " None Given " , due to a mix - up with the names .
Pi 's father finds the story so amusing that they continue to call the tiger " Richard Parker " .
RECEPTION Section::::Reception .
Brian Bethune of Maclean 's describes Life of Pi as a " head - scratching combination of dense religious allegory , zoological lore and enthralling adventure tale , written with warmth and grace " .
Master Plots suggested that the " central themes of Life of Pi concern religion and human faith in God " .
Reutter said , " So believable is Pi 's story telling that readers will be amazed . "
Gregory Stephens added that it " achieves something more quietly spectacular . "
Smith stated that there was " no bamboozlement here . "
Gary Krist of The New York Times praised the book , but added that at times Martel " pushes the didactic agenda of his story too hard . "
In 2010 , U.S. President Barack Obama wrote a letter directly to Martel , describing Life of Pi as " an elegant proof of God , and the power of storytelling . "
