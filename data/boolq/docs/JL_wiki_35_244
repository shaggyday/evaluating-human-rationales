PLOT Section::::Plot .
In 1972 , Mason Skiles is a U.S. diplomat in Lebanon living in Beirut with his Lebanese wife , Nadia .
They have recently begun caring for Karim , a 13-year - old Palestinian boy who claims he is without a family .
While hosting a party , Skiles is confronted by his friend , CIA officer Cal Riley , who wishes to question Karim , whose brother has been linked to the 1972 Munich massacre .
The party is attacked by Karim 's brother , Rami , who abducts Karim ; in the ensuing gunfight , Nadia is killed .
Ten years later , Skiles has become an alcoholic and is working as a self - employed labor arbitrator in New England .
While arbitrating a labor issue between particularly intransigent parties and struggling to keep his small firm afloat , he is approached by Sully , an old client , on behalf of the U.S. government .
Sully discloses that Skiles has been requested for an academic lecture in Lebanon , and hands him money , a plane ticket , and a passport .
Skiles is initially resistant but decides to travel to Beirut .
He meets several government officials , including Donald Gaines , Colonel Gary Ruzak , and Ambassador Frank Whalen , along with CIA officer Sandy Crowder , and learns that Cal Riley was recently abducted in Lebanon .
The kidnappers have specifically requested Skiles as the negotiator .
The group meets with the kidnappers and find Karim heading the organization .
Karim demands the release of his brother in exchange for Riley , despite the Americans ' protest that they do not have Rafid in captivity .
Skiles suspects that Israel is holding Rafid , and travels with Ruzak to secure his release .
The Israelis reveal that they do not have Rafid , and Skiles returns to Beirut to meet with Alice , Riley 's wife .
Alice holds Skiles responsible for Riley 's abduction , believing that Riley has remained in Lebanon over the guilt he feels for Nadia 's death .
The next day , while Skiles is conducting the lecture at the American University of Beirut ( the official reason for his visit ) , a car bomb is set off outside the building .
In the ensuing chaos , Skiles is instructed to leave to meet Karim .
Karim brings him to Riley , who covertly tells Skiles that the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) is holding Rafid and that Gaines is not to be trusted .
Before releasing Skiles , Karim threatens that unless Rafid is returned later that night , he will sell Riley to Iran .
Skiles returns to Riley 's apartment to search for clues , where he encounters Crowder .
She reveals that Gaines had been stealing money from the embassy and that Riley had been preparing to make a report shortly before his disappearance .
Skiles convinces Crowder that the PLO is holding Rafid , and she steals $ 4 million from the CIA office to trade for Rafid .
After Skiles attacks a PLO officer , he sets up a trade for Rafid and brings him to the exchange with Karim .
After trading Riley for Rafid , Rafid is shot and killed by a Mossad sniper in a nearby building .
The Americans successfully escape .
The Mossad sniper is actually Bernard who originally met Skiles when he arrived to Beirut .
Bernard meets Sandrine , the mistress of the PLO officer whom Skiles attacked , who is also an Israeli agent , and leaves on a helicopter .
Before departing Beirut , Skiles learns that Gaines has unexpectedly retired and that Ruzak has left Beirut .
Crowder announces her intention to apply for the newly vacant jobs , and Skiles offers his services as a negotiator .
As the film ends , news footage is shown of the subsequent Israeli invasion of Lebanon , increasing international involvement in the country , and , finally , the bombings of the U.S. Embassy and the U.S. Marine Corps ' barracks in Beirut in 1983 .

TRAILER CRITICISM Section::::Trailer criticism .
The film 's trailer received criticism from social media users for dehumanizing Arabs and Muslims , having a white savior narrative , ignoring political complexities of the Lebanese Civil War , and failing to show Lebanese people as fully formed characters .
The trailer 's closing tagline of " 2,000 years of revenge , vendetta , murder ... welcome to Beirut " has been criticized as a confusing misrepresentation of the history of Beirut .
The trailer was criticized by Sopan Deb in the New York Times .
He called it offensive , portraying a stereotypical image of Lebanese , Arabs and the Middle East at large .
He points out that no Lebanese actors are featured in the film , and cites a social media hashtag , # BoycottBeirutMovie , as evidence of the trailer 's reception in Lebanon .
Walaa Chahine , writing for the Huffington Post , echoed similar criticisms , arguing that the trailer " seems to follow the same rhetoric so many other Middle East thrillers like to portray - Arabs are barbaric and uncivilized , and their countries are a mess " .
