BUY ONE , GET ONE FREE
" Buy one , get one free " or " two for the price of one " is a common form of sales promotion .
Economist Alex Tabarrok has argued that the success of this promotion lies in the fact that the price actually takes into account the fact that two items are being sold .
The price of " one " is somewhat nominal and is typically raised when used as part of a buy one get one free deal .
Whilst the cost per item is proportionately cheaper than if bought on its own , it is not actually half price .
This technique is commonly known in the marketing industry by the acronym BOGOF .
