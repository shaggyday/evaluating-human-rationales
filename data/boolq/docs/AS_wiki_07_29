PLOT Section::::Plot .
The film begins as Lizzie McGuire prepares for her junior - high graduation with one of her two closest friends , David " Gordo " Gordon .
Her other best friend , Miranda , has chosen to skip the graduation ceremony in favor of a trip to Mexico City to visit relatives .
During the ceremony , Lizzie trips onstage and accidentally brings the curtain down on her fellow graduates ; this causes her to be teased by her ex - best friend Kate Sanders and her younger brother Matt .
After graduation , Lizzie and some of her class embark on a trip to Rome , Italy , chaperoned by their future high school principal , the rude and stern Angela Ungermeyer .
To their dismay , Lizzie and Kate are assigned to the same hotel room .
Their class visits the Trevi Fountain , where Lizzie is approached by an Italian pop star named Paolo who mistakes her for his singing partner , Isabella .
Paolo asks Lizzie to meet him at the fountain the next day , and she feigns illness to sneak away .
He explains that he and Isabella are booked for the Italian Music Awards , but she left Italy after their breakup .
Paolo tells Lizzie that Isabella lip syncs , and begs her to pose as Isabella for the concert .
Lizzie reluctantly agrees but soon begins to enjoy the experience and to fall in love with Paolo .
Lizzie continues to fake being ill to prepare for the concert , but Kate quickly figures out her secret .
To Lizzie 's surprise , Kate agrees to help her and the two become friends again .
Meanwhile , Ms. Ungermeyer interrogates the students to learn who has been sneaking out .
Gordo takes the blame and is sent back home as punishment .
Lizzie is shocked when Kate says that Gordo sacrificed himself to protect her .
Back home , Matt browses the Internet and finds Italian gossip sites with pictures of Lizzie as Isabella .
When he tells his parents , the family flies to Rome .
At the airport Gordo meets Isabella , who is upset that someone is impersonating her .
She and Gordo realize that Paolo is planning to have a nervous Lizzie unknowingly sing live at the concert ( as Isabella actually does ) , creating the impression that Isabella is a fake , which would damage Isabella 's career and embarrass Lizzie .
Gordo and Isabella rush to the concert to stop him .
When Lizzie 's parents arrive in Rome , Ms. Ungermeyer learns that Lizzie is missing .
Ethan reveals that she is performing at the Italian Music Awards , and Lizzie 's family and the class also rush to the concert .
Backstage , Gordo and Isabella find Lizzie preparing for the show and warn her about Paolo 's scheme .
Lizzie refuses to believe them at first , but Isabella convinces her that Paolo is using her .
Ms. Ungermeyer gets the class ( and Lizzie 's family ) into the concert by pushing through the bouncers .
During the performance Isabella and Gordo expose Paolo ( who is actually the one who lip syncs ) by turning on his microphone , revealing his real voice .
Embarrassed , Paolo runs off stage and is ambushed outside by paparazzi .
Isabella introduces Lizzie to the crowd , and the two of them sing " What Dreams Are Made Of " ; when Isabella leaves the stage , Lizzie finishes the song solo , displaying a newfound confidence .
Later , they all celebrate at the hotel 's after party , where Ms. Ungermeyer rescinds Gordo 's punishment .
Lizzie and Gordo sneak away from the party to go up to the roof , where they promise to never let things change between them .
The two kiss and then rejoin the party .

The site 's consensus stated it was a " harmless piece of fluff that ought to satisfy fans of the TV show " .
Scott Brown of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B+ : "
Let 's face it : Lizzie McGuire ( Hilary Duff ) is just too darn polished to be a junior - high underdog , even by the standards of her ' luxe suburban environs ' .
But that has n't tarnished her comeback - kid cred among the six - and - ups who faithfully follow her Disney Channel show â€” and it does n't make The Lizzie McGuire Movie , a clever , agreeably weightless theatrical outing , any less enjoyable . "
Conversely , Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four , but praised Borstein 's performance , calling her work " the only really delightful element in the movie ; everything else is simply slick and professional . "
