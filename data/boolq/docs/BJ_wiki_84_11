HISTORY Section::::History .
It was introduced in 1958 and initially released as a dietetic product , but was introduced nationwide and marketed to the general public as a healthful beverage in 1962 .
The original formula was sweetened with cyclamate and saccharin .
After cyclamate was banned in 1969 , it was removed from the product .
NutraSweet brand aspartame was added upon its introduction to the market , and in 1987 the saccharin was replaced entirely with together with complete elimination of caffeine .
In the 1990s , several fruit - flavored varieties of Diet Rite were introduced .
In 2000 , the line was reformulated yet again , this time to replace aspartame with Splenda brand sucralose and Sunett brand Acesulfame potassium .
It became the first major diet soda in the United States to use neither aspartame nor saccharin as a sweetener .
In 2005 , " Pure Zero " was added to the name , and a cherry cola flavor was introduced in 2006 .
Today it is owned by and distributed by Keurig Dr Pepper .
