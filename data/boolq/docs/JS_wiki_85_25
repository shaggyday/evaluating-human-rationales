PLOT Section::::Plot .
In the future , after a second civil war , most reading in America is confined to the Internet , called " the 9 , " and most books are banned ( except for The Bible , To the Lighthouse and Moby Dick ) and ordered to be burned by the " firemen " who are part of the Ministry , an authoritarian dictatorship that blames unhappiness , mental illness , and conflicting opinions on reading the " wrong " literature .
Guy Montag , a fireman living in Cleveland , goes about his work without question , believing that by following in his father 's footsteps he is serving and protecting society .
All this changes when he meets an informant named Clarisse , who makes him challenge his actions and convictions by sharing with him some of the real history of America and the rise of the Ministry .
When he finally decides to rebel and understand how the " Eels " ( book - reading outcasts ) read , he comes to a realization â€” he now wants to read as well .
Montag decides to help a rebel who has a plan to reproduce their information through animals .
This rebel group encoded books into a bird 's DNA so that it can live on and survive the efforts of the firemen .
Montag is confronted by Captain Beatty and finds himself on the run , eventually connecting with a group of Eels .
The Eels ' house is discovered by the firemen ; Montag finds the bird and places a transponder inside it so that it can find its way to scientists in Canada .
Captain Beatty confronts him and attempts to stop him , but allows the bird to fly away .
After Montag releases the bird , Beatty burns him alive in a fit of rage .
The starling makes it to Canada , and joins with an immense flock of other starlings .

RECEPTION Section::::Reception .
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the film holds an approval rating of 35 % based on 68 reviews , and an average rating of 5/10 .
The site 's critical consensus reads , " Fahrenheit 451 fails to burn as brightly as its classic source material , opting for slickly mundane smoke - blowing over hard - hitting topical edge .
"
On Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating to reviews , the film has a score of 47 out of 100 , based on 19 critics , indicating " mixed or average reviews " .
For IndieWire , Ben Travers gave the film a grade of " C+ " , writing that " Michael B. Jordan and Michael Shannon make for a compelling pair in an aptly modernized update that still feels far too conventional .
" Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter praised the production value but wrote that ( referring to the ending of the adaptation ) " as disturbing as the forecast for American life and politics may be in Fahrenheit 451 , this wrinkle nonetheless serves to seriously diminish the absolute need to preserve texts when they 're known to still exist elsewhere ; when America gets its head on straight again , there is backup to resupply the intellectually deprived . "
In his review for Rogerebert.com , Odie Henderson noted the steering of Bradbury 's ideas into the factual realm , drawing parallels with the satirical direction of Network being weakened by the evolution of television , adding that " much of the novel 's shock value and allegorical power also feels weakened as a result . "
IGN 's Matt Fowler wrote that the film " features strong performances and a dancing , flickering visual flare , but all that 's not enough to cover up the clunkiness of the script and the strain of reconfiguring this always relevant -
yet still very 1950s - story to fit within our 2018 specifics " .
Entertainment Weeklys Darren Franich wrote that the film " has its heart in the right place , but its head sure crawled up somewhere . "
