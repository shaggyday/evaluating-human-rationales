MALIGNANT HYPERTHERMIA Malignant hyperthermia ( MH ) is a type of severe reaction that occurs to particular medications used during general anesthesia , among those who are susceptible .
Symptoms include muscle rigidity , high fever , and a fast heart rate .
Complications can include rhabdomyolysis and high blood potassium .
Most people who are susceptible are generally otherwise normal when not exposed .
The cause of MH is the use of certain volatile anesthetic agents or succinylcholine in those who are susceptible .
Susceptibility can occur due to at least six genetic mutations , with the most common one being of the RYR1 gene .
Susceptibility is often inherited from a person 's parents in an autosomal dominant manner .
The condition may also occur as a new mutation or be associated with a number of inherited muscle diseases , such as central core disease .
In susceptible individuals , the medications induce the release of stored calcium ions within muscle cells .
The resulting increase in calcium concentrations within the cells cause the muscle fibers to contract .
This generates excessive heat and results in metabolic acidosis .
Diagnosis is based on symptoms in the appropriate situation .
Family members may be tested to see if they are susceptible by muscle biopsy or genetic testing .
Treatment is with dantrolene and rapid cooling along with other supportive measures .
The avoidance of potential triggers is recommended in susceptible people .
The condition affects one in 5,000 to 50,000 cases where people are given anesthetic gases .
Males are more often affected than females .
The risk of death with proper treatment is about 5 % while without it is around 75 % .
While cases that appear similar to MH have been documented since the early 20th century , the condition was only formally recognized in 1960 .
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Section::::Signs and symptoms .
The typical signs of malignant hyperthermia are due to a hypercatabolic state , which presents as a very high temperature , an increased heart rate and abnormally rapid breathing , increased carbon dioxide production , increased oxygen consumption , mixed acidosis , rigid muscles , and rhabdomyolysis .
These signs can develop any time during the administration of the anesthetic triggering agents .
It is difficult to find confirmed cases in the postoperative period more than several minutes after discontinuation of anesthetic agents .
CAUSES Section::::Causes .
Malignant hyperthermia is a disorder that can be considered a gene - environment interaction .
In most people with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility , they have few or no symptoms unless they are exposed to a triggering agent .
The most common triggering agents are volatile anesthetic gases , such as halothane , sevoflurane , desflurane , isoflurane , enflurane or the depolarizing muscle relaxants suxamethonium and decamethonium used primarily in general anesthesia .
In rare cases , the biological stresses of physical exercise or heat may be the trigger .
Other anesthetic drugs are considered safe .These include local anesthetics ( lidocaine , bupivacaine , mepivacaine ) , opiates ( morphine , fentanyl ) , ketamine , barbiturates , nitrous oxide , propofol , etomidate , and benzodiazepines .
The nondepolarizing muscle relaxants pancuronium , cisatracurium , atracurium , mivacurium , vecuronium and rocuronium also do not cause MH .
There is mounting evidence that some individuals with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility may develop MH with exercise and/or on exposure to hot environments .
GENETICS Section::::Genetics .
Malignant hyperthermia 's inheritance is autosomal dominant with variable penetrance .
The defect is typically located on the long arm of chromosome 19 ( 19q13.2 ) involving the ryanodine receptor .
More than 25 different mutations in this gene are linked with malignant hyperthermia .
These mutations tend to cluster in one of three domains within the protein , designated MH1 - 3 .
MH1 and MH2 are located in the N - terminus of the protein , which interacts with L - type calcium channels and .
MH3 is located in the transmembrane forming C - terminus .
This region is important for allowing passage through the protein following opening .
Chromosome 7q and chromosome 17 have also been implicated .
It has also been postulated that MH and central core disease may be allelic and thus can be co - inherited .
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY DISEASE MECHANISM Section::::Pathophysiology .
Section::::Disease mechanism .
In a large proportion ( 50–70 % ) of cases , the propensity for malignant hyperthermia is due to a mutation of the ryanodine receptor ( type 1 ) , located on the sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR ) , the organelle within skeletal muscle cells that stores calcium .
RYR1 opens in response to increases in intracellular level mediated by L - type calcium channels , thereby resulting in a drastic increase in intracellular calcium levels and muscle contraction .
RYR1 has two sites believed to be important for reacting to changing concentrations : the A - site and the I - site .
The A - site is a high affinity binding site that mediates RYR1 opening .
The I - site is a lower affinity site that mediates the protein 's closing .
Caffeine , halothane , and other triggering agents act by drastically increasing the affinity of the A - site for and concomitantly decreasing the affinity of the I - site in mutant proteins .
also affect RYR1 activity , causing the protein to close by acting at either the A- or I - sites .
In MH mutant proteins , the affinity for at either one of these sites is greatly reduced .
The end result of these alterations is greatly increased release due to a lowered activation and heightened deactivation threshold .
The process of sequestering this excess consumes large amounts of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , the main cellular energy carrier , and generates the excessive heat ( hyperthermia ) that is the hallmark of the disease .
The muscle cell is damaged by the depletion of ATP and possibly the high temperatures , and cellular constituents " leak " into the circulation , including potassium , myoglobin , creatine , phosphate and creatine kinase .
The other known causative gene for MH is CACNA1S , which encodes an L - type voltage - gated calcium channel α - subunit .
There are two known mutations in this protein , both affecting the same residue , R1086 .
This residue is located in the large intracellular loop connecting domains 3 and 4 , a domain possibly involved in negatively regulating RYR1 activity .
When these mutant channels are expressed in human embryonic kidney ( HEK 293 ) cells , the resulting channels are five times more sensitive to activation by caffeine ( and presumably halothane ) and activate at 5–10mV more hyperpolarized .
Furthermore , cells expressing these channels have an increased basal cytosolic concentration .
As these channels interact with and activate
RYR1 , these alterations result in a drastic increase of intracellular , and , thereby , muscle excitability .
Other mutations causing MH have been identified , although in most cases the relevant gene remains to be identified .
ANIMAL MODEL
Section::::Animal model .
Research into malignant hyperthermia was limited until the discovery of " porcine stress syndrome " ( PSS ) in Danish Landrace and other pig breeds selected for muscling , a condition in which stressed pigs develop " pale , soft , exudative " flesh ( a manifestation of the effects of malignant hyperthermia ) rendering their meat less marketable at slaughter .
This " awake triggering " was not observed in humans , and initially cast doubts on the value of the animal model , but subsequently , susceptible humans were discovered to " awake trigger " ( develop malignant hyperthermia ) in stressful situations .
This supported the use of the pig model for research .
Pig farmers use halothane cones in swine yards to expose piglets to halothane .
Those that die were MH - susceptible , thus saving the farmer the expense of raising a pig whose meat he would not be able to market .
This also reduced the use of breeding stock carrying the genes for PSS .
The condition in swine is also due to a defect in ryanodine receptors .
Gillard et al .
discovered the causative mutation in humans only after similar mutations had first been described in pigs .
Horses also suffer from malignant hyperthermia .
A causative mutated allele , ryanodine receptor 1 gene
( RyR1 ) at nucleotide C7360 G , generating a R2454 G amino acid substitution .
has been identified in the American Quarter Horse and breeds with Quarter Horse ancestry , inherited as an autosomal dominant It can be caused by overwork , anesthesia , or stress .
In dogs , its inheritance is autosomal recessive .
An MH mouse has been constructed , bearing the R163C mutation prevalent in humans .
These mice display signs similar to human MH patients , including sensitivity to halothane ( increased respiration , body temperature , and death ) .
Blockade of RYR1 by dantrolene prevents adverse reaction to halothane in these mice , as with humans .
Muscle from these mice also shows increased -induced depolarization and an increased caffeine sensitivity .
DIAGNOSIS DURING AN ATTACK Section::::Diagnosis .
Section::::During an attack .
The earliest signs may include : masseter muscle contracture following administration of succinylcholine , a rise in end - tidal carbon dioxide concentration ( despite increased minute ventilation ) , unexplained tachycardia , and muscle rigidity .
Despite the name , elevation of body temperature is often a late sign , but may appear early in severe cases .
Respiratory acidosis is universally present and many patients have developed metabolic acidosis at the time of diagnosis .
A fast rate of breathing ( in a spontaneously breathing patient ) , cyanosis , hypertension , abnormal heart rhythms , and high blood potassium may also be seen .
Core body temperatures should be measured in any patient undergoing general anesthesia longer than 30 minutes .
Malignant hyperthermia is diagnosed on clinical grounds , but various laboratory investigations may prove confirmatory .
These include a raised creatine kinase level , elevated potassium , increased phosphate ( leading to decreased calcium ) and — if determined — raised myoglobin ; this is the result of damage to muscle cells .
Severe rhabdomyolysis may lead to acute kidney failure , so kidney function is generally measured on a frequent basis .
Patients may also get premature ventricular contractions due to the increased levels of potassium released from the muscles during episodes .
SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING MUSCLE TESTING Section::::Susceptibility testing .
Section::::Muscle testing .
The main candidates for testing are those with a close relative who has suffered an episode of MH or have been shown to be susceptible .
The standard procedure is the " caffeine - halothane contracture test " , CHCT .
A muscle biopsy is carried out at an approved research center , under local anesthesia .
The fresh biopsy is bathed in solutions containing caffeine or halothane and observed for contraction ; under good conditions , the sensitivity is 97 % and the specificity 78 % .
Negative biopsies are not definitive , so any patient who is suspected of MH by their medical history or that of blood relatives is generally treated with non - triggering anesthetics , even if the biopsy was negative .
Some researchers advocate the use of the " calcium - induced calcium release " test in addition to the CHCT to make the test more specific .
Less invasive diagnostic techniques have been proposed .
Intramuscular injection of halothane 6 vol% has been shown to result in higher than normal increases in local among patients with known malignant hyperthermia susceptibility .
The sensitivity was 100 % and specificity was 75 % .
For patients at similar risk to those in this study , this leads to a positive predictive value of 80 % and negative predictive value of 100 % .
This method may provide a suitable alternative to more invasive techniques .
A 2002 study examined another possible metabolic test .
In this test , intramuscular injection of caffeine was followed by local measurement of the ; those with known MH susceptibility had a significantly higher ( 63 versus 44 mmHg ) .
The authors propose larger studies to assess the test 's suitability for determining MH risk .
GENETIC TESTING Section::::Genetic testing .
Genetic testing is being performed in a limited fashion to determine susceptibility to MH .
In people with a family history of MH , analysis for RYR1 mutations may be useful .
CRITERIA Section::::Criteria .
A 1994 consensus conference led to the formulation of a set of diagnostic criteria .
The higher the score ( above 6 ) , the more likely a reaction constituted MH : * Respiratory acidosis ( end - tidal above 55 mmHg/7.32 kPa or arterial above 60 mmHg/7.98 kPa )
* Heart involvement ( unexplained sinus tachycardia , ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation )
* Metabolic acidosis ( base excess lower than -8 , pH < 7.25 ) * Muscle rigidity ( generalized rigidity including severe masseter muscle rigidity )
* Muscle breakdown ( CK > 20,000 / L units , cola colored urine or excess myoglobin in urine or serum , potassium above 6 mmol / l )
* Temperature increase ( rapidly increasing temperature , T > 38.8 ° C )
*
Other ( rapid reversal of MH signs with dantrolene , elevated resting serum CK levels )
* Family history ( autosomal dominant pattern ) PREVENTION Section::::Prevention .
In the past , the prophylactic use of dantrolene was recommended for MH - susceptible patients undergoing general anesthesia .
However , multiple retrospective studies have demonstrated the safety of trigger - free general anesthesia in these patients in the absence of prophylactic dantrolene administration .
The largest of these studies looked at the charts of 2214 patients who underwent general or regional anesthesia for an elective muscle biopsy .
About half ( 1082 ) of the patients were muscle biopsy positive for MH .
Only five of these patients exhibited signs consistent with MH , four of which were treated successfully with parenteral dantrolene , and the remaining one recovered with only symptomatic therapy .
After weighing its questionable benefits against its possible adverse effects ( including nausea , vomiting , muscle weakness and prolonged duration of action of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents ) , experts no longer recommend the use of prophylactic dantrolene prior to trigger - free general anesthesia in MH - susceptible patients .
ANESTHESIA MACHINE PREPARATION
Section::::Anesthesia machine preparation .
Anesthesia for people with known MH susceptible requires avoidance of triggering agent concentrations above 5 parts per million ( all volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine ) .
All other drugs are safe ( including nitrous oxide ) , as are regional anesthetic techniques .
Where general anesthesia is planned , it can be provided safely by either flushing the machine or using charcoal filters .
To flush the machine , first remove or disable the vaporizers and then flush the machine with 10 L / min or greater fresh gas flow rate for at least 20 minutes .
While flushing the machine the ventilator should be set to periodically ventilate a new breathing circuit .
The soda lime should also be replaced .
After machine preparation , anesthesia should be induced and maintained with non - triggering agents .
The time required to flush a machine varies for different machines and volatile anesthetics .
This prevention technique was optimized to prepare older generation anesthesia machines .
Modern anesthetic machines have more rubber and plastic components which provide a reservoir for volatile anesthetics , and should be flushed for 60 minutes .
Charcoal filters can be used to prepare an anesthesia machine in less than 60 seconds for people at risk of malignant hyperthermia .
These filters prevent residual anesthetic from triggering malignant hyperthermia for up to 12 hours , even at low fresh gas flows .
Prior to placing the charcoal filters , the machine should be flushed with fresh gas flows greater than 10 L / min for 90 seconds .
TREATMENT Section::::Treatment .
The current treatment of choice is the intravenous administration of dantrolene , the only known antidote , discontinuation of triggering agents , and supportive therapy directed at correcting hyperthermia , acidosis , and organ dysfunction .
Treatment must be instituted rapidly on clinical suspicion of the onset of malignant hyperthermia .
DANTROLENE Section::::Dantrolene .
Dantrolene is a muscle relaxant that appears to work directly on the ryanodine receptor to prevent the release of calcium .
After the widespread introduction of treatment with dantrolene , the mortality of malignant hyperthermia fell from 80 % in the 1960s to less than 5 % .
Dantrolene remains the only drug known to be effective in the treatment of MH .
The recommended dose of dantrolene is 2.5 mg / kg , repeated as necessary .
It is recommended that each hospital keeps a minimum stock of 36 dantrolene vials ( 720 mg ) , sufficient for four doses in a 70-kg person .
TRAINING
Section::::Training .
Fast recognition and treatment of MH utilizes skills and procedures that are utilized with a low - frequency and high - risk .
Conducting MH crisis training for perioperative teams can identify system failures as well as improve response to these events .
Simulation techniques to include the use of cognitive aids have also been shown to improve communication in clinical treatment of MH .
PROGNOSIS Section::::Prognosis .
Prognosis is poor if this condition is not aggressively treated .
In the 1970s , mortality was greater than 80 % ; with the current management , however , mortality is now less than 5 % .
EPIDEMIOLOGY Section::::Epidemiology .
It occurs in between 1:5,000 and 1:100,000 in procedures involving general anaesthesia .
This disorder occurs worldwide and affects all racial groups .
In the Manawatu region of New Zealand , up to 1 in 200 people are at high risk of the condition .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The syndrome was first recognized in Royal Melbourne Hospital , Australia in an affected family by Denborough et al .
in 1962 .
Denborough did much of his subsequent work on the condition at the Royal Canberra Hospital .
Similar reactions were found in pigs .
The efficacy of dantrolene as a treatment was discovered by South African anesthesiologist Gaisford Harrison and reported in a 1975 article published in the British Journal of Anaesthesia .
After further animal studies corroborated the possible benefit from dantrolene , a 1982 study confirmed its usefulness in humans .
In 1981 , the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States ( MHAUS ) hotline was established to provide telephone support to clinical teams treating patients with suspected malignant hyperthermia .
The hotline became active in 1982 and since that time MHAUS has provided continuous access to board certified anesthesiologists to assist teams in treatment .
OTHER ANIMALS
Section::::Other animals .
Other animals , including certain pig breeds , dogs , and horses , are susceptible to malignant hyperthermia .
In dogs its inheritance is autosomal dominant .
In pigs its inheritance is autosomal recessive .
In horses its inheritance is autosomal dominant , and most associated with the American Quarter Horse although it can occur in other breeds .
RESEARCH Section::::Research .
Azumolene is a 30-fold more water - soluble analog of dantrolene that also works to decrease the release of intracellular calcium by its action on the ryanodine receptor .
In MH - susceptible swine , azumolene was as potent as dantrolene .
It has yet to be studied in vivo in humans , but may present a suitable alternative to dantrolene in the treatment of MH .
