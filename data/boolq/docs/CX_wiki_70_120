LIEUTENANT COLONEL ( UNITED STATES )
In the United States Army , U.S. Marine Corps , and U.S. Air Force , a lieutenant colonel is a field - grade military officer rank just above the rank of major and just below the rank of colonel .
It is equivalent to the naval rank of commander in the other uniformed services .
The pay grade for the rank of lieutenant colonel is O-5 .
In the United States armed forces , the insignia for the rank consists of a silver oak leaf , with slight stylized differences between the Army / Air Force version and the Navy / Marine Corps version .
Promotion to lieutenant colonel is governed by Department of Defense policies derived from the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act ( DOPMA ) of 1980 for officers in the Active Component and its companion Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act ( ROPMA ) for officers in the Reserve Component ( e.g. , Reserve and National Guard ) .
DOPMA guidelines suggest 70 % of majors should be promoted to lieutenant colonel after serving a minimum of three years at their present rank and after attaining 15–17 years of cumulative commissioned service .
ETYMOLOGY Section::::Etymology .
While sometimes written as " Lt . Colonel " in orders and signature blocks , as a courtesy , lieutenant colonels are addressed simply as " colonel " verbally and in the salutation of correspondence .
The U.S. Army uses the three letter abbreviation " LTC , " while the United States Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force use the abbreviations of " LtCol " and " Lt Col " ( note the space ) , respectively .
These abbreviation formats are also outlined in The Naval Institute Guide to Naval Writing and in Air Force Handbook 33 - 337 ( AFH 33 - 337 ) , The Tongue and Quill .
The U.S. Government Printing Office recommends the abbreviation " LTC " for U.S. Army usage , " LtCol " for Marine Corps usage , and " Lt . Col . " for the Air Force .
The Associated Press Stylebook recommends the abbreviation " Lt . Col . " for the Army , Marine Corps , and Air Force .
Slang terms for the rank historically used by the U.S. military include " light colonel " , " short colonel " , " light bird " , " half colonel " , " bottlecap colonel " ( referring to the silver oak leaf insignia ) , and " telephone colonel " ( from self - reference as " colonel " when using a telephone ) .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The rank of lieutenant colonel has existed in the British Army since at least the 16th century and was used in both American colonial militia and colonial regular regiments .
The Continental Army continued the British and colonial use of the rank of lieutenant colonel , as the second - in - command to a colonel commanding a regiment .
The lieutenant colonel was sometimes known as " lieutenant to the colonel . "
In British practice , regiments were actually commanded by their lieutenant colonels , as the colonel was a titular position ( with the incumbent absent from the regiment serving as a senior staff officer , a general officer , or as a member of the nobility ) .
Since the British colonel was not a " combat " officer , beginning in May 1778 to simplify prisoner of war exchanges , American regiments began to eliminate colonels by attrition and replace them with a lieutenant colonel commandant .
The conversion was never completely effected and some regiments remained commanded by colonels throughout the war .
From 1784 until 1791 , there was only one lieutenant colonel in the US Army ( Josiah Harmar ) , who acted as the army 's commanding officer .
In the Continental Army aides to the Commander in Chief , viz . , Lieutenant General George Washington , were lieutenant colonels .
Additionally , certain officers serving under the Adjutant General , Inspector General , and Judge Advocate General , ranked as lieutenant colonels .
During the 19th century , lieutenant colonel was often a terminal rank for many officers , since the rank of " full colonel " was considered extremely prestigious reserved only for the most successful officers .
Upon the outbreak of the Civil War , the rank of lieutenant colonel became much more common and was used as a " stepping stone " for officers who commanded small regiments or battalions and were expected , by default , to be promoted to full colonel once the manpower of a regiment grew in strength .
Such was the case of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain , who commanded a Maine regiment as both a lieutenant colonel and later as a colonel .
After the Civil War ended , those officers remaining in the United States Armed Forces found lieutenant colonel to again be a terminal rank , although many lieutenant colonels were raised to higher positions in a brevet status .
Such was the case with George A. Custer , who was a lieutenant colonel in the regular army , but held the brevet rank of major general .
The 20th century saw lieutenant colonel in its present - day status although , during the 1930s , many officers again found the rank to be terminal as the rank of colonel was reserved for only a select few officers .
MODERN USAGE Section::::Modern usage .
In the United States Army and the United States Marine Corps ( USMC ) , a lieutenant colonel typically commands a battalion / squadron - sized unit ( 300 to 1,200 Soldiers / Marines ) , with a major as executive officer ( XO ) and a command sergeant major / sergeant major ( USMC )
as principal NCO or senior enlisted adviser ( SEA ) .
A lieutenant colonel may also serve as a brigade / brigade combat team , regiment / regimental combat team , Marine Aviation Group ( MAG ) , Marine Expeditionary Unit ( MEU ) , or battalion task force executive officer .
Lieutenant colonels routinely serve as principal staff officers , under a colonel as chief of staff , on a general staff ( " G " staff ) of a division , Marine Expeditionary Brigade ( MEB ) , Marine Aircraft Wing ( MAW ) , or Marine Logistics Group ( MLG ) .
These staff positions may include : G-1 ( administration and personnel ) , G-2 ( intelligence ) , G-3 ( operations ) , G-4 ( logistics ) , G-5 ( civil / military affairs ) , or G-6 ( computers and communications ) .
Usage of " The G - n " may refer to either a specific staff section or the staff officer leading a section .
Lieutenant colonels may also be junior staff at a variety of higher echelons .
In the United States Air Force , a lieutenant colonel is generally a squadron commander in the operations group , mission support group , or maintenance groups , or a squadron commander or division chief in a medical group .
They may also serve as a Deputy Commander for Operations ( DO ) in a squadron in the operations group prior to assuming command of their own squadron ( this is common for aeronautically rated officers in flying units ) , or as a deputy commander of a squadron in the maintenance , mission support or medical groups .
Lieutenant colonels may also serve on general staffs and may be the heads of some wing staff departments .
Senior lieutenant colonels occasionally serve as group commanders , most commonly in units of the Air Force Reserve Command or the Air National Guard .
In U.S. Army ROTC detachments , the commander is typically a lieutenant colonel , along with several majors , captains , and non - commissioned officers serving as assistants .
In the U.S. Air Force , Air Force ROTC detachments may be commanded by full colonels or lieutenant colonels depending on the size of the detachment and the size of the associated college or university .
NON - MILITARY USE Section::::Non - military use .
The rank of lieutenant colonel is also used by many large American municipal police departments , county sheriff 's offices / departments , state highway patrols / state police and other law enforcement agencies for officers in senior administrative positions .
The rank is not always called " lieutenant colonel , " and in many cases – particularly with municipal police agencies – an alternate term such as " assistant chief " or " commander " is used , and only the insignia is retained .
In some organizations , however , especially state police agencies , both the title and insignia are used .
Occasionally , the rank is used in conjunction with , rather than instead of , an official title .
For example , in the Texas Department of Public Safety , the head of the agency 's patrol division is titled " Chief of the Highway Patrol " , but holds the rank of a lieutenant colonel : this figure is thus referred to as " lieutenant colonel , " not " chief " .
