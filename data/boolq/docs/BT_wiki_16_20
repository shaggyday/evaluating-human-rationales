Swanson ( 2011 ) examines the critical role of Guy M. Brandborg of the U.S. Forest Service , who was supervisor of the Bitterroot National Forest from 1935 to 1955 .
By insisting on selection cutting , he tried to protect the watersheds and wildlife habitats that are harmed by clear - cutting .
After he retired in 1955 Brandborg denounced the Forest Service for deviating from his model .
He launched a public attack , known as the " Bitterroot controversy . "
Brandborg lobbied to secure passage of the National Forest Management Act of 1976 , that codified his model .
