SYNOPSIS
ACT 1
Section::::Synopsis . Section::::Act 1 .
There 's a party at Delray 's , an underground black Rock and Roll bar in 1950s Memphis
( " Underground " ) .
Huey Calhoun , a white man , arrives on the scene .
The regulars begin to leave , but Huey convinces them to stay , claiming he is there for the music ( " The Music of My Soul " ) .
Later , Huey is about to be fired from his job as a stock boy at a local department store , but he makes a deal with the owner , if he can sell 5 records by playing them over the speakers , he can have a sales job .
Huey plays a rock & roll hit ( " Scratch My Itch " ) .
He sells 29 records in five minutes , but the store owner fires him anyway , incensed at the type of music being played .
Huey returns to Delray 's club , and begins flirting with Felicia , Delray 's talented sister , and promises to get her on the radio ( " Ai n't Nothin' But a Kiss " ) .
Huey then proceeds to apply for DJ jobs at various local white radio stations ( " Hello My Name is Huey " ) .
One of the owners , Mr. Simmons , invites him in , saying he 'll show him what a ' real ' DJ looks like .
Huey hijacks the mic , and plays another African - American rock song
( " Everybody Wants to be Black on Saturday Night " ) .
Mr. Simmons is about to have Huey thrown out , but then dozens of teenagers start calling in demanding more of Huey and his music ( " That 's Not Possible " ) .
Mr. Simmons agrees to give him a two - week trial , and if he 's successful he 'll get hired full - time .
After a few days Huey is told to read an advertisement for beer , but he is illiterate .
Huey asks Bobby , a friend of Delray 's with a janitor position , to tell him what it says .
He forgets the exact words almost immediately and begins to improvise , ending with the phrase " Hockadoo ! " .
Mr. Simmons again almost fires Huey , until the manager of the store advertised calls in saying that he wants Huey to do all of his advertisements , seeing as his stock sold out in minutes .
Huey 's station gains immediate popularity , as does his new catch phrase , even though no one understands what it means ... including Huey .
While on the radio , Huey encourages white people to go down to black churches ( " Make Me Stronger " ) , and they begin to .
Meanwhile , Delray has saved enough money to put Felicia 's voice on the record , and she travels to Huey 's house to tell him this .
He is overjoyed and promises to play it the next day .
Huey 's prejudiced mother , however , breaks the record , which leaves Felicia heartbroken , but Huey tells her to come down to the radio station anyway ( " Colored Woman " ) .
The next day , Huey brings in a band and back - up singers to play for Felicia live .
Despite her reservations , Felicia sings and becomes an instant sensation ( " Someday " ) .
Felicia and Huey 's relationship begins to grow , and Delray is becoming more and more infuriated with Huey .
He warns him of the danger of what he is doing , threatening to harm Huey if anything happens to Felicia ( " She 's My Sister " ) .
Huey 's radio popularity grows more and more as white teens and black teens begin to accept each other ( " Radio " ) .
Huey and Felicia have been carrying on a secret relationship since the day she sang live on the radio .
Two years later Huey proposes to Felicia on the way to a party at Delray 's .
She says no because of laws and prejudice , but admits that without those obstacles she would accept .
As the two share a kiss , a gang of white men pass by , spotting this .
They hold Huey down as they beat Felicia with a bat .
Huey manages to carry her into the club , crying out for help .
Delray tries to go after Huey , for he promised to harm Huey should Felicia get hurt because of him , but Gator , a friend who has not spoken since he saw his father lynched as a child , calms him and sends out a prayer for change as Delray takes Felicia outside and gets her into the ambulance they called ( " Say a Prayer " ) .
ACT 2 Section::::Act 2 .
Time has passed , and Huey is about to open his new TV show , a rock and roll variety show featuring all black dancers ( " Crazy Little Huey " ) .
Felicia is supposed to be his first guest , but she backs out at the last minute , fearing that people will think her and Huey to be in a relationship .
Huey informs Bobby that he will fill in , and after getting over some jitters , Bobby brings the house down ( " Big Love " ) .
Felicia 's popularity is also beginning to grow around Memphis , as does her relationship with Huey .
Felicia tells Huey that if they went to New York they would n't have to sneak around all the time , but Huey insists that they are happy the way they are and do n't need to leave ( " Love Will Stand When All Else Falls " ) .
She has been discovered by a talent agency in New York , as has Huey 's TV show .
The agency wants them both to come up to New York , although Huey has to compete with Dick Clark for the national show .
They ponder the decision ( " Stand Up " ) , and are even supported by Huey 's mother , who has changed her racist ways after seeing a black church choir ( " Change Do n't Come Easy " ) .
Huey is told he has won the TV position , if he agrees not to use black dancers .
Huey refuses , and proceeds to strip out of his suit on the air ( " Tear Down the House " ) .
Felicia tells Huey that she plans to go anyway , as it is her dream .
In a desperate attempt to keep her , he kisses her on the air , and says he loves her ( " Love Will Stand /
Ain't
Nothin'
But a Kiss " ( Reprise ) ) .
The feed is cut , and Huey is fired on the grounds that no one would watch his show if they knew about him and Felicia , and that he was n't the only white person to play black music anymore .
Felicia is taken away by Delray in an attempt to save her career .
Now unemployed , Huey leaves the station and ponders his relationship with Memphis , realizing he could n't leave for any reason ( " Memphis Lives in Me " ) .
Four years later , Huey is a DJ on an obviously low budget and low rated station ( he jokes that they have " exactly one listener " ) .
Felicia walks in , about to start a national tour .
She tells Huey that she is engaged to a man named Bill , but that she wants him to join her on stage one last time .
He refuses , afraid that no one will remember him .
She begins her performance , and halfway through the song Huey walks on stage , and finishes the song with her to thunderous applause .
He then proclaims " The name is Huey Calhoun .
Goodnight and HOCKADOO ! "
( " Steal Your Rock and Roll " ) .

CRITICAL RECEPTION Section::::Critical reception .
Memphis opened to mainly positive reviews .
The New York Post 's Elisabeth Vincentelli stated , " An exuberant musical with classic values : catchy songs , heaping spoonfuls of inspirational moments , and gifted performers at the top of their game . "
Michael Kuchwara of the Associated Press also praised the show , stating " The exhilarating new musical shaking the Shubert Theatre is the very essence of what a Broadway musical should be . "
Joe Dziemianowicz of the New York Daily News gave the show three and a half out of five stars and said , " It 's nice to know a new musical can actually surprise you !
Though it starts on a familiar note and sparks deja vu at other points , Memphis eventually finds its own voice and beat , and wins you over with its sheer enthusiasm and exuberant performances . "
John Simon of the Bloomberg News praised the show as well : " I guarantee you a rambunctious good time , highlighted by rousing music and singing , spectacular dancing , and a witty , moving story . "
Despite these positive reviews , Memphis had its share of negative reviews .
Although both Glover and Kimball received almost unanimous praise for their portrayals of Felicia and Huey , the show was criticized for its storyline .
Charles Isherwood of The New York Times gave the show a lukewarm review , stating " This slick but formulaic entertainment , written by David Bryan and Joe DiPietro , barely generates enough heat to warp a vinyl record , despite the vigorous efforts of a hard charging cast . "
However he praised the performance of both leading performers . "
Miss Glover , beautiful and poised , brings a spark of toughness to her role as Felicia .
She acts with a focused clarity and sings with intensity . "
