GIBRALTAR POUND
The Gibraltar pound ( currency sign : £ ; banking code : GIP ) is the currency of Gibraltar .
It is pegged to – and exchangeable with – the British pound sterling at par value .
Gibraltar pound coins are minted notes printed by the Government of Gibraltar .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Until 1872 , the currency situation in Gibraltar was complicated , with a system based on the real being employed which encompassed British , Spanish and Gibraltarian coins .
From 1825 , the real ( actually the Spanish real de plata ) was tied to the pound at the rate of 1 Spanish dollar to 4 shillings 4 pence ( equivalent to 21.67 pence today ) .
In 1872 , however , the Spanish currency became the sole legal tender in Gibraltar .
In 1898 , the Spanish – American War made the Spanish peseta drop alarmingly and the pound was introduced as the sole currency of Gibraltar , initially in the form of British coins and banknotes .
In 1898 , the British pound was made sole legal tender , although the Spanish peseta continued in circulation until the Spanish Civil War .
Since 1927 , Gibraltar has issued its own banknotes and , since 1988 , its own coins .
Gibraltar decimalised in 1971 at the same time as the UK , replacing the system of 1 pound = 20 shillings = 240 pence with one of 1 pound = 100 ( new ) pence .
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BRITISH POUND Section::::Relationship with the British pound .
The since repealed Currency Notes Act 1934 , conferred on the Government of Gibraltar the right to print its own notes .
Notes issued are either backed by Bank of England notes at a rate of one pound to one pound sterling , or can be backed by securities issued by the Government of Gibraltar .
Although Gibraltar notes are denominated in " pounds sterling " , they are not legal tender anywhere in the United Kingdom .
Gibraltar 's coins are the same weight , size and metal as British coins , although the designs are different , and they are occasionally found in circulation across Britain .
Under the Currency Notes Act 2011 the notes and coins issued by the Government of Gibraltar are legal tender and current coin within Gibraltar .
British coins and Bank of England notes also circulate in Gibraltar and are universally accepted and interchangeable with Gibraltarian issues .
COINS Section::::Coins .
In 1988 , coins in denominations of 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 pence and 1 pound were introduced which bore specific designs for and the name of Gibraltar .
They were the same sizes and compositions as the corresponding British coins , with 2 pound coins introduced in 1999 .
A new coin of 5 pounds was issued in 2010 with the inscription " Elizabeth II · Queen of Gibraltar " .
This issue caused controversy in Spain , where the title of King of Gibraltar historically corresponds to the crown of Castile .

£ 2.00 BANKNOTES Section::::Banknotes .
At the outbreak of World War I , Gibraltar was forced to issue banknotes to prevent paying out sterling or gold .
These notes were issued under emergency wartime legislation , Ordinance 10 of 1914 .
At first the typeset notes were signed by hand by Treasurer Greenwood , though he later used stamps .
The notes bore the embossed stamp of the Anglo - Egyptian Bank Ltd. and circulated alongside British Territory notes .
The 1914 notes were issued in denominations of 2 and 10 shillings , 1 , 5 and 50 pounds .
The 2 shilling and 50 pound notes were not continued when a new series of notes was introduced in 1927 .
The 10 shilling note was replaced by the 50 pence coin during the process of decimalization .
In 1975 , 10 and 20 pound notes were introduced , followed by 50 pounds in 1986 .
The 1 pound note was discontinued in 1988 .
In 1995 , a new series of notes was introduced which , for the first time , bore the words " pounds sterling " rather than just " pounds " .
The government of Gibraltar introduced a new series of banknotes beginning with the 10 and 50 pound sterling notes issued on July 8 , 2010 .
On May 11 , 2011 , the 5 , 20 and 100 pound sterling notes were issued . !
