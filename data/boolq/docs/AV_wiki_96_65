RESPIRATORY TRACT
In humans , the respiratory tract is the part of the anatomy of the respiratory system involved with the process of respiration .
Air is breathed in through the nose or the mouth .
In the nasal cavity , a layer of mucous membrane acts as a filter and traps pollutants and other harmful substances found in the air .
Next , air moves into the pharynx , a passage that contains the intersection between the esophagus and the larynx .
The opening of the larynx has a special flap of cartilage , the epiglottis , that opens to allow air to pass through but closes to prevent food from moving into the airway .
From the larynx , air moves into the trachea and down to the intersection that branches to form the right and left primary ( main ) bronchi .
Each of these bronchi branch into secondary ( lobar ) bronchi that branch into tertiary ( segmental ) bronchi that branch into smaller airways called bronchioles that eventually connect with tiny specialized structures called alveoli that function in gas exchange .
The lungs which are located in the thoracic cavity , are protected from physical damage by the rib cage .
At the base of the lungs is a sheet of skeletal muscle called the diaphragm .
The diaphragm separates the lungs from the stomach and intestines .
The diaphragm is also the main muscle of respiration involved in breathing , and is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system .
The lungs are encased in a serous membrane that folds in on itself to form the pleurae – a two - layered protective barrier .
The inner visceral pleura covers the surface of the lungs , and the outer parietal pleura is attached to the inner surface of the thoracic cavity .
The pleurae enclose a cavity called the pleural cavity that contains pleural fluid .
This fluid is used to decrease the amount of friction that lungs experience during breathing .
STRUCTURE
Section::::Structure .
The respiratory tract is divided into the upper airways and lower airways .
The upper airways or upper respiratory tract includes the nose and nasal passages , paranasal sinuses , the pharynx , and the portion of the larynx above the vocal folds ( cords ) .
The lower airways or lower respiratory tract includes the portion of the larynx below the vocal folds , trachea , bronchi and bronchioles .
The lungs can be included in the lower respiratory tract or as separate entity and include the respiratory bronchioles , alveolar ducts , alveolar sacs , and alveoli .
The respiratory tract can also be divided into a conducting zone and a respiratory zone , based on the distinction of transporting gases or exchanging them .
The conducting zone includes structures outside of the lungs – the nose , pharynx , larynx , and trachea , and structures inside the lungs – the bronchi , bronchioles , and terminal bronchioles .
The conduction zone conducts air breathed in that is filtered , warmed , and moistened , into the lungs .
It represents the 1st through the 16th division of the respiratory tract .
The conducting zone is most of the respiratory tract that conducts gases into and out of the lungs , but excludes the respiratory zone that exchanges gases .
The conducting zone also functions to offer a low resistance pathway for airflow .
It provides a major defense role in its filtering abilities .
The respiratory zone includes the respiratory bronchioles , alveolar ducts and alveoli , and is the site of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange with the blood .
The respiratory bronchioles and the alveolar ducts are responsible for 10 % of the gas exchange .
The alveoli are responsible for the other 90 % .
The respiratory zone represents the 16th through the 23rd division of the respiratory tract .
From the bronchi , the dividing tubes become progressively smaller with an estimated 20 to 23 divisions before ending at an alveolus .
UPPER RESPIRATORY
TRACT Section::::Upper respiratory tract .
The upper respiratory tract , can refer to the parts of the respiratory system lying above the sternal angle ( outside of the thorax ) , above the vocal folds , or above the cricoid cartilage .
The larynx is sometimes included in both the upper and lower airways .
The larynx is also called the voice box and has the associated cartilage that produces sound .
The tract consists of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses , the pharynx ( nasopharynx , oropharynx and laryngopharynx ) and sometimes includes the larynx .
LOWER RESPIRATORY
TRACT Section::::Lower respiratory tract .
The lower respiratory tract or lower airway is derived from the developing foregut and consists of the trachea , bronchi ( primary , secondary and tertiary ) , bronchioles ( including terminal and respiratory ) , and lungs ( including alveoli ) .
It also sometimes includes the larynx .
The lower respiratory tract is also called the respiratory tree or tracheobronchial tree , to describe the branching structure of airways supplying air to the lungs , and includes the trachea , bronchi and bronchioles .
* trachea * main bronchus ( diameter approximately 1 – 1.4 cm in adults )
* lobar bronchus ( diameter approximately 1 cm )
* segmental bronchus ( diameter 4.5 to 13 mm ) * subsegmental bronchus ( diameter 1 to 6 mm ) * conducting bronchiole * terminal bronchiole * respiratory bronchiole *
alveolar duct
* alveolar sac * alveolus At each division point or generation , one airway branches into two or more smaller airways .
The human respiratory tree may consist on average of 23 generations , while the respiratory tree of the mouse has up to 13 generations .
Proximal divisions ( those closest to the top of the tree , such as the bronchi ) mainly function to transmit air to the lower airways .
Later divisions including the respiratory bronchiole , alveolar ducts and alveoli , are specialized for gas exchange .
The trachea is the largest tube in the respiratory tract and consists of tracheal rings of hyaline cartilage .
It branches off into two bronchial tubes , a left and a right main bronchus .
The bronchi branch off into smaller sections inside the lungs , called bronchioles .
These bronchioles give rise to the air sacs in the lungs called the alveoli .
The lungs are the largest organs in the lower respiratory tract .
The lungs are suspended within the pleural cavity of the thorax .
The pleurae are two thin membranes , one cell layer thick , which surround the lungs .
The inner ( visceral pleura ) covers the lungs and the outer ( parietal pleura ) lines the inner surface of the chest wall .
This membrane secretes a small amount of fluid , allowing the lungs to move freely within the pleural cavity while expanding and contracting during breathing .
The lungs are divided into different lobes .
The right lung is larger in size than the left , because of the heart 's being situated to the left of the midline .
The right lung has three lobes – upper , middle , and lower ( or superior , middle and inferior ) , and the left lung has two – upper and lower ( or superior and inferior ) , plus a small tongue - shaped portion of the upper lobe known as the lingula .
Each lobe is further divided up into segments called bronchopulmonary segments .
Each lung has a costal surface , which is adjacent to the ribcage ; a diaphragmatic surface , which faces downward toward the diaphragm ; and a mediastinal surface , which faces toward the center of the chest , and lies against the heart , great vessels , and the carina where the two mainstem bronchi branch off from the base of the trachea .
The alveoli are tiny air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange takes place .
The mean number of alveoli in a human lung is 480 million .
When the diaphragm contracts , a negative pressure is generated in the thorax and air rushes in to fill the cavity .
When that happens , these sacs fill with air , making the lung expand .
The alveoli are rich with capillaries , called alveolor capillaries .
Here the red blood cells absorb oxygen from the air and then carry it back in the form of oxyhaemaglobin , to nourish the cells .
The red blood cells also carry carbon dioxide ( )
away from the cells in the form of carboxyhemoglobin and releases it into the alveoli through the alveolor capillaries .
When the diaphragm relaxes , a positive pressure is generated in the thorax and air rushes out of the alveoli expelling the carbon dioxide .
MICROANATOMY Section::::Microanatomy .
The respiratory tract is covered in epithelium , which varies down the tract .
There are glands and mucus produced by goblet cells in parts , as well as smooth muscle , elastin or cartilage .
Most of the epithelium ( from the nose to the bronchi ) is covered in ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium , commonly called respiratory epithelium .
The cilia beat in one direction , moving mucus towards the throat where it is swallowed .
Moving down the bronchioles , the cells get more cuboidal in shape but are still ciliated .
Glands are abundant in the upper respiratory tract , but there are fewer lower down and they are absent starting at the bronchioles .
The same goes for goblet cells , although there are scattered ones in the first bronchioles .
Cartilage is present until the small bronchi .
In the trachea they are C - shaped rings of hyaline cartilage , whereas in the bronchi the cartilage takes the form of interspersed plates .
Smooth muscle starts in the trachea , where it joins the C - shaped rings of cartilage .
It continues down the bronchi and bronchioles , which it completely encircles .
Instead of hard cartilage , the bronchi and bronchioles are composed of elastic tissue .
The lungs are made up of thirteen different kinds of cells , eleven types of epithelial cell and two types of mesenchymal cell .
The epithelial cells form the lining of the tracheal , and bronchial tubes , while the mesenchymal cells line the lungs .
FUNCTION Section::::Function .
Most of the respiratory tract exists merely as a piping system for air to travel in the lungs , and alveoli are the only part of the lung that exchanges oxygen and carbon dioxide with the blood .
RESPIRATION Section::::Respiration .
Respiration is the rhythmical process of breathing , in which air is drawn into the alveoli of the lungs via inhalation and subsequently expelled via exhalation .
When a human being inhales , air travels down the trachea , through the bronchial tubes , and into the lungs .
The entire tract is protected by the rib cage , spine , and sternum .
In the lungs , oxygen from the inhaled air is transferred into the blood and circulated throughout the body .
Carbon dioxide ( CO ) is transferred from returning blood back into gaseous form in the lungs and exhaled through the lower respiratory tract and then the upper , to complete the process of breathing .
Unlike the trachea and bronchi , the upper airway is a collapsible , compliant tube .
As such , it has to be able to withstand suction pressures generated by the rhythmic contraction of the diaphragm that sucks air into the lungs .
This is accomplished by the rhythmic contraction of upper airway muscles , such as the genioglossus ( tongue ) and the hyoid muscles .
In addition to rhythmic innervation from the respiratory center in the medulla oblongata , the motor neurons controlling the muscles also receive tonic innervation that sets a baseline level of stiffness and size .
The diaphragm is the primary muscle that allows for lung expansion and contraction .
Smaller muscles between the ribs , the external intercostals , assist with this process .
DEFENCES AGAINST INFECTION
Section::::Defences against infection .
The epithelial lining of the upper respiratory tract is interspersed with goblet cells that secrete a protective mucus .
This helps to filter waste , which is eventually either swallowed into the highly acidic stomach environment or expelled via spitting .
The epithelium lining the respiratory tract is covered in small hairs called cilia .
These beat rhythmically out from the lungs , moving secreted mucus foreign particles toward the laryngopharynx upwards and outwards , in a process called the mucociliary escalator .
In addition to keeping the lower respiratory tract sterile , they prevent mucus accumulation in the lungs .
Macrophages in the alveoli are part of the immune system which engulf and digest any inhaled harmful agents .
Hair in the nostrils plays a protective role , trapping particulate matter such as dust .
The cough reflex expels all irritants within the mucus membrane to the outside .
The airways of the lungs contain rings of muscle .
When the passageways are irritated by some allergen , these muscles can constrict .
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Section::::Clinical significance .
The respiratory tract is a common site for infections .
INFECTION Section::::Infection .
Upper respiratory tract infections are probably the most common infections in the world .
The respiratory system is very prone to developing infections in the lungs .
Infants and older adults are more likely to develop infections in their lungs , because their lungs are not as strong in fighting off these infections .
Most of these infections used to be fatal , but with new research and medicine , they are now treatable .
With bacterial infections , antibiotics are prescribed , while viral infections are harder to treat , but still curable .
The common cold / flu is the most common cause for the upper respiratory tract infection , which can cause more serious illness that can develop in the lower respiratory tract .
Pneumonia is the most common , and frequent lower respiratory tract infection .
This can be either viral , bacterial , or fungal .
This infection is very common , because pneumonia can be airborne , and when you inhale this infection in the air , the particles enter the lungs and move into the air sacs .
This infection quickly develops in the lower part of the lung , and fills the lung with fluid , and excess mucus .
This causes difficulty in breathing , and coughing as the lower respiratory tract tries to get rid of the fluid in the lungs .
You can be more prone to developing this infection if you have asthma , flu , heart disease , or cancer LUNG CANCER Section::::Lung cancer .
Some of these cancers have environmental causes such as smoking .
When a tobacco product is inhaled , the smoke paralyzes the cilia , causing mucus to enter the lungs .
Frequent smoking , over time causes the cilia hairs to die and can no longer filter mucus .
Tar from the smoke inhaled enters the lungs , turning the pink - coloured lungs black .
The accumulation of this tar could eventually lead to lung cancer , or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE
PULMONARY DISEASE Section::::Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) is a common lower respiratory disease that can be caused by exposure to harmful chemicals , or prolonged use of tobacco .
This disease is chronic and progressive , the damage to the lungs is irreversible and eventually fatal .
COPD destroys the alveoli , and lung tissue which makes breathing very difficult , causing shortness of breath , hyperventilation , and raised chest .
The decreased number of alveoli causes loss of oxygen supply to the lungs , and an increased accumulation of carbon dioxide .
There are two types of COPD : primary and secondary .
Primary COPD can be found in younger adults .
This type of COPD deteriorates the air sacs , and lung mass .
Secondary COPD can be found in older adults who smoke or have smoked and have a history of bronchitis .
Older terms for COPD are emphysema and chronic bronchitis .
ASTHMA Section::::Asthma .
The bronchi are the main passages to the right and left lungs .
These airways carry the oxygen to the bronchioles inside the lungs .
Inflammation of the bronchii and bronchioles can cause them to swell up , which could lead to an asthma attack .
This results in wheezing , tightness of the chest and severe difficulty in breathing .
There are different types of asthma that affect the functions of the bronchial tubes .
Allergies can also set off an allergic reaction , causing swelling of the bronchial tubes ; as a result , the air passage will swell up , or close up completely .
