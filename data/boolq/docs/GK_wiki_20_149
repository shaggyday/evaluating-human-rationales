CONSUMER ( FOOD CHAIN )
Consumers are organisms that eat organisms from a different population .
These organisms are formally referred to as heterotrophs , which include animals , some bacteria and fungi .
Such organisms may consume by various means , they are called primary consumers .
CLASSIFICATION Section::::Classification .
Consumers are typically viewed as predatory animals such as the wolf and hyena .
However , herbivorous animals and parasitic fungi are also consumers .
Some carnivorous plants , like the Venus flytrap , are classified as both .
So are omnivorous animals .
LEVELS OF THE FOOD CHAIN Section::::Levels of the food chain .
Within an ecological food chain , Consumers are categorized into primary consumers , secondary consumers , and the tertiary consumers .
Primary consumers are herbivores , feeding on plants .
Secondary consumers , on the other hand , are carnivores , and prey on other animals .
Omnivores , who feed on both plants and animals , can also be considered a secondary consumer .
Tertiary consumers , sometimes also known as apex predators , are usually at the top of food chains , capable of feeding on secondary consumers and primary consumers .
Tertiary consumers can be either fully carnivorous or omnivorous .
Humans are one such example of a tertiary consumer .
IMPORTANCE TO THE ECOSYSTEM
Section::::Importance to the ecosystem .
Consumers have important roles to play within an ecosystem such as balancing the food chain by keeping plant populations at a reasonable number .
Without proper balance , an ecosystem can collapse and cause the decline of all affected species .
This will lead to a severely disrupted ecosystem and a nonfunctional consumer web .
