SPRING FEVER Spring fever is any of a number of mood , physical , or behavioral changes , which may be experienced coinciding with the arrival of spring , particularly restlessness , laziness , and even amorousness .
OVERVIEW
Section::::Overview .
The term spring fever is an auto - antonym ( a term with multiple and opposed meanings ) :
On the one hand , the term may refer to an increase in energy , vitality , and sexual appetite , as well as a feeling of restlessness , associated with the end of winter .
This concept may have a biological basis .
A lift in mood with the arrival of spring , and longer periods of daylight , is often particularly strong in those suffering from seasonal affective disorder ( SAD ) , who experience lows or depression during the winter months .
It is this sense that inspires the use of the term as a title for several works of literature and entertainment .
On the other hand , the term may sometimes be used to describe an opposite effect of springtime lethargy or depression .
