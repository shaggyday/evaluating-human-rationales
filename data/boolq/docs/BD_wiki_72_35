COLOR WONDER
Color Wonder is a product made by Crayola , primarily intended for use by younger children , in which the special clear - ink marker only appears on the Color Wonder paper .
Originally made with markers and paper , Color Wonder has also made specialty products including paints , etc .
The Color Wonder products debuted in 1993 .
Color Wonder paints and fingerpaints , as well as Color Wonder
coloring books of popular characters such as Disney Pixar 's Cars and Disney Princess also exist .
The ' magic ' clear - ink products were designed so that toddlers and young children do n't stain their clothes , paint on the walls , etc .
Crayola has a patent under Binney & Smith relating to this kind of mess - free marking system .
An applicator , such as a felt pen , uses a composition containing a clear leuco dye that is developed by color - triggering compounds in the paper substrate .
There is also another line similar to this one by Crayola , but marketed towards older children , called Color Explosion .
It is like Color Wonder , except there is not only one color hidden in the paper , but stripes , dots , and swirls of a variety of colors , depending on the package you get ( Fire & Ice , Twisted Tropicals , etc . )
It is also available in black and white paper .
