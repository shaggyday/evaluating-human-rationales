INTEL CORE 2 Core 2 is a brand encompassing a range of Intel 's consumer 64-bit x86 - 64 single- , dual- , and quad - core microprocessors based on the Core microarchitecture .
The single- and dual - core models are single - die , whereas the quad - core models comprise two dies , each containing two cores , packaged in a multi - chip module .
The introduction of Core 2 relegated the Pentium brand to the mid - range market , and reunified laptop and desktop CPU lines for marketing purposes under the same product name , which previously had been divided into the Pentium 4 , Pentium D , and Pentium M brands .
The Core 2 brand was introduced on July 27 , 2006 , comprising the Solo ( single - core ) , Duo ( dual - core ) , Quad ( quad - core ) , and in 2007 , the Extreme ( dual- or quad - core CPUs for enthusiasts ) subbrands .
Intel Core 2 processors with vPro technology ( designed for businesses ) include the dual - core and quad - core branches .
Although Woodcrest processors are also based on the Core architecture , they are available under the Xeon brand .
Since December 2006 , all Core 2 Duo processors are manufactured from 300 millimeter plates at Fab 12 factory in Arizona , USA and at Fab 24 - 2 in County Kildare , Ireland .

The Core 2-branded CPUs include : " Conroe"/"Allendale " ( dual - core for desktops ) , " Merom " ( dual - core for laptops ) , " Merom - L " ( single - core for laptops ) , " Kentsfield " ( quad - core for desktops ) , and the updated variants named " Wolfdale " ( dual - core for desktops ) , " Penryn " ( dual - core for laptops ) , and " Yorkfield " ( quad - core for desktops ) .
( Note : For the server and workstation " Woodcrest " , " Tigerton " , " Harpertown " and " Dunnington " CPUs see the Xeon brand . )
The Core 2 branded processors feature Virtualization Technology ( with some exceptions ) , Execute Disable Bit , and SSE3 .
Their Core microarchitecture introduced SSSE3 , Trusted Execution Technology , Enhanced SpeedStep , and Active Management Technology ( iAMT2 ) .
With a maximum thermal design power ( TDP ) of 65W , the Core 2 Duo Conroe dissipates half the power of the less capable contemporary Pentium D - branded desktop chips that have a max TDP of 130 W. !

2 microprocessors
With the release of the Core 2 processor , the abbreviation C2 has come into common use , with its variants C2D ( the present Core 2 Duo ) , and C2Q , C2E to refer to the Core 2 Quad and Core 2 Extreme processors respectively .
C2QX stands for the Extreme - Editions of the Quad ( QX6700 , QX6800 , QX6850 ) .
The successors to the Core 2 brand are a set of Nehalem microarchitecture based processors called Core i3 , i5 , and i7 .
Core i7 was officially launched on November 17 , 2008 as a family of three quad - core processor desktop models , further models started appearing throughout 2009 .
The last Core 2 processor to be released was the Core 2 Quad Q9500 in January 2010 .
The Core 2 processor line was removed from the official price lists in July 2011 .
