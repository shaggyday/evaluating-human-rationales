BLIND - BAKING
Baking blind ( sometimes called pre - baking ) is the process of baking a pie crust or other pastry without the filling .
Blind baking a pie crust is necessary when it will be filled with an unbaked filling ( such as with pudding or cream pies ) , in which case the crust must be fully baked .
It is also called for if the filling has a shorter bake time than the crust , in which case the crust is partly baked .
Blind baking is also used to keep pie crust from becoming soggy due to a wet filling .
Blind baking can be accomplished by different methods .
In one technique , the pie crust is lined with aluminium foil or parchment paper , then filled with pastry- or pie weights ( sometimes called " baking beans " )
to ensure the crust retains its shape while baking .
Pie - weights are available as ceramic or metal beads , but rice , dried peas , lentils , beans or other pulses can be used instead .
When using this method for a fully baked crust , the weights are removed before the pre - baking is complete in order to achieve a browned crust .
Another technique dispenses with weights by placing a second pie tin on top of the crust , then inverting the tins to bake .
In this method , the crust browns between the tins .
A further simplified technique involves piercing the crust repeatedly with the tines of a fork to produce small holes , allowing steam to escape and preventing the crust from bubbling up , but that does not work with soft doughs such as pâte sucrée .
