HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE CAREER
Section::::High school and college career .
Before his college career at Notre Dame , Brown played for Woodrow Wilson High School in Dallas , the same school as 1938 Heisman Trophy winner Davey O'Brien .
Brown 's receipt of the 1987 Heisman Trophy gave Woodrow the distinction of being the first high school in the country to have produced two Heisman Trophy winners .
Amazingly , Tim did n't play football as a freshman at Woodrow , because he was forbidden to do so by his mother .
Instead , he played in the Woodrow band during that first year .
But he joined the Woodrow football team as a sophomore , although he initially tried to hide that fact from his mom .
She later found out about it when the band leader called his house asking why he was no longer at band practices .
Despite his outstanding contributions to Woodrow 's football program , the team fared poorly , posting only a 4–25–1 record over his three years as a starter .
Nevertheless , Brown was heavily recruited by major colleges .
His five official visits were to Notre Dame , Nebraska , Oklahoma , nearby SMU and Iowa .
While at Woodrow , Brown also was a standout track athlete .
He was one of the state 's top performers in the 400-meter dash , with a PR of 47.14 seconds , and he cleared 7.42 meters in the long jump event .
Brown chose the University of Notre Dame and played there from 1984–1987 , earning the nickname " Touchdown Timmy .
" In his first year , he set a freshman record with twenty - eight receptions .
As a junior , he set a record with 1,937 all - purpose yards .
Offensively he ran for 254 yards with 2 TD and caught 45 passes for 910 yards with 5 TD .
During 1987 , Brown caught 34 passes for 846 yards , returned 34 punts for 401 yards , rushed for 144 yards , gained 456 yards on 23 kickoff returns , and scored eight touchdowns .
Brown finished his career at Notre Dame with 137 receptions for 2,493 yards , a school record 5,024 all - purpose yards , and 22 touchdowns .
However , just as in high school , Brown 's team achieved limited success , with a 25–21 record over his four seasons , and an 0–2 record in bowl games .
But in the year after Brown graduated ( 1988 ) , Notre Dame won the national title .
Brown made the College Football All - America Team twice and won the 1987 Heisman Trophy , becoming the first wide receiver ever to win that award .
As of 2015 , Woodrow Wilson High School remains the only public high school with two Heisman Trophy winners .
When Brown graduated , he held 19 individual school records .
In 1989 , Brown and Davey O'Brien were inducted together as members of the initial class of the Woodrow Wilson High School Hall of Fame , created in celebration of the school 's 60th Anniversary .
In 2009 , Brown was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame .
In January 2012 , Brown received the Silver Anniversary Award from the NCAA in recognition of his myriad athletic and professional accomplishments .
NFL CAREER Section::::NFL career .
Brown was selected by the Los Angeles Raiders with the 6th pick of the 1988 NFL Draft .
In his first NFL season , he led the league in kickoff returns , return yards , and yards per return average .
Though it took time for him to fill into the role as the team 's # 1 receiver , catching just 147 passes in his first five seasons , he went on to rack up 9 consecutive 1,000-yard seasons from 1993 - 2001 .
He also led the NFL in punt returns in 1994 , and receptions in 1997 .
In March 1994 , Brown was offered and signed a free - agent offer - sheet with the Denver Broncos .
The Raiders matched the offer soon thereafter .
He was voted to the Pro Bowl nine times , in 1988 and 1991 as a kick returner , and in 1993 - 97 , 1999 and 2001 as a receiver .
In 2001 , Brown would later play alongside another well - known wide receiver , Jerry Rice .
On December 9 , 2001 , Brown returned a punt 88 yards for a touchdown in a home game against the Kansas City Chiefs , making him the oldest player in NFL history to score a touchdown on a punt return .
In 2002 , he passed Gene Upshaw to become the Raiders ' all - time leader in games played with 224 .
He also set Raiders franchise records for receptions , receiving yards , and punt return yards .
Brown was released by the Raiders before the 2004 season , as he did not want to accept a smaller role in the offense .
He was signed shortly thereafter by the Buccaneers ( coached by former Raider head coach Jon Gruden ) .
The move was controversial , considering that Brown had always been a fan favorite in the Oakland area and was much admired by many current and former Raiders players and staff over the sixteen years he spent with the Raider organization .
He was the last of the Los Angeles Raiders to remain with Oakland .
On September 27 , 2004 , in his first game at Oakland since being signed by Tampa Bay , Brown reached 100 career receiving touchdowns , tying him ( with Steve Largent ) for 3rd on the NFL 's all - time career receiving touchdown list at that time
( behind former teammate Jerry Rice [ 197 ] and Cris Carter [ 130 ] ) .
He received a standing ovation from the Oakland Raider crowd .
In 2005 , Brown signed a one - day contract with the Raiders to retire with the team .
The July 18 news conference was attended by two Raiders officials and only one active Raider , wide receiver Jerry Porter .
Brown retired with 14,934 receiving yards , the second - highest total in NFL history , 1,094 receptions ( 3rd ) , and 100 touchdown catches ( 3rd - Tied ) .
Brown also gained 190 rushing yards , 3,320 punt - return yards ( 5th in NFL history ) , 3 fumble - return yards , and 1,235 yards returning kickoffs .
This gave him a total of 19,682 combined net yards , ranking him # 5 among the NFL 's all - time leaders at the time of his retirement .
He also scored 105 total touchdowns ( 100 receiving , 1 rushing , 3 punt returns , 1 kickoff return ) .
Brown is the only player ever to retire in the NFL 's top five leaders for both receiving and return yards .
Brown became eligible for enshrinement in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2010 , but was not selected that year .
He was considered a long shot to get in on his first try , as there was a logjam of accomplished receiver candidates , including Jerry Rice ( Brown 's former teammate ) , Cris Carter and Andre Reed .
On January 7 , 2012 and again on January 11 , 2013 , Brown was selected as a finalist for enshrinement in the Pro Football Hall of Fame , but was not chosen .
On January 31 , 2015 , Brown was selected for enshrinement in the Pro Football Hall of Fame .
He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on August 8 , 2015 .

However , the plan never successfully began .
He now lives in DeSoto , Texas .
RELATIONSHIP WITH RAIDERS OWNER AL DAVIS
Section::::Relationship with Raiders owner Al Davis .
Since joining the Raiders , Brown had a complicated relationship with the Oakland Raiders and late owner Al Davis .
During a 2009 interview with Sportsradiointerview.com Brown commented on his former boss :
" Meeting Al ( Davis ) was pretty unique .
I found out five or ten minutes after my first practice there that he hated African - American athletes from Notre Dame .
And they literally told me that .
They literally told me that because we 're known for using our education more than our athletic ability that he thought that I would be one of these guys that would basically take the money and run .
I do n't know if that was a ploy to get me amped up , but it certainly worked . "
In 2000 , Brown was dining in an Oakland restaurant with former Raiders Chester McGlockton and Sean Jones .
During their meal , Brown found himself unable to approach or speak to Davis .
Brown told a reporter , " I was saddened by that because I do n't know anybody who I 've dealt with for twelve years who I ca n't say hello to in that situation .
I was saddened that the situation is where it is . "
On August 5 , 2004 , the Raiders held a press conference with Brown and Davis which stated that Brown was leaving the Raiders .
Davis and Brown professed mutual respect for one another and both men expressed a desire for Brown to return to the Raiders someday .
On July 19 , 2005 , Brown officially retired but the Raiders did not hold a press conference at the team headquarters .
Instead , Brown held his own press conference in an Oakland hotel ballroom .
Davis did not attend the conference because he had a " scheduling conflict " .
Davis did allow Brown to sign a ceremonial $ 765,000 contract with the Raiders so he could retire as an Oakland Raider .
Brown 's 2004 departure from the Raiders eventually became acrimonious , and the outspoken receiver often criticized Davis , senior assistant Michael Lombardi and coach Norv Turner publicly for conspiring to make him expendable .
Former teammates Marcus Allen , Lincoln Kennedy and Chester McGlockton attended the press conference .
For the Raiders , Amy Trask , the Raiders ' chief executive officer who had Brown sign the ceremonial contract , Marc Badain , a finance executive and Mike Taylor , the team 's director of public relations , were on hand .
At the time , Raiders receiver Jerry Porter was also in attendance .
Lincoln Kennedy stuck up for the absence of Davis stating " It 's not his style ; he 'll probably invite Tim up to his office , or out to dinner later on .
But this ?
This is not his style . "
Recent history suggested that Davis was possibly out of touch with the football world prior to his death in 2011 because the Raiders had suffered through seven straight losing seasons ( 2003–2009 ) since losing to Tampa Bay in Super Bowl XXXVII .
Brown disagreed , stating "
In a lot of peoples ' minds , Al is out of touch , but nothing is further from the truth .
He is still quite lucid . "
