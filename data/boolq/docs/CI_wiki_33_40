SPECIAL SESSION
In a legislature , a special session ( also extraordinary session ) is a period when the body convenes outside of the normal legislative session .
This most frequently occurs in order to complete unfinished tasks for the year ( often delayed by conflict between political parties ) , such as outlining the government 's budget for the next fiscal year , biennium , or other period .
Special sessions may also be called during an economic downturn in order to cut the budget .
In other cases , a special session may be convened to address special topics , or emergencies such as war or natural disaster .
Who calls a special session varies - by vote of the legislature during regular session , by the executive , or by the legislature 's speaker or presiding officer .
The United Nations has both special sessions and emergency special sessions .
UNITED STATES Section::::United States .
In the United States of America , Article II , Section 3 of the United States Constitution gives the President of the United States the power to " on extraordinary occasions , convene both Houses or either of them . "
This power exists for urgent or extraordinary situations that require congressional action when Congress is adjourned .
Presidents have exercised this power 46 times to recall only the Senate and 28 times to recall both Chambers of Congress , most recently by Harry Truman in 1948 .
The Senate itself differentiates between " extraordinary sessions " called by the Presidential proclamation and " special sessions " that merely indicate a session not normally scheduled .
The term " session " can refer to either the formal start and end of a Congressional session or the daily sessions of the chambers of Congress .
Thus a formal " special session " will only happen when Congress has adjourned sine die and is not simply in recess ( in other words Congress may or may not already be in an official session , but in recess , when convened ) .
