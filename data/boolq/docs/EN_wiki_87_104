THE TERROR ( NOVEL )
The Terror is a 2007 novel by American author Dan Simmons .
It is a fictionalized account of Captain Sir John Franklin 's lost expedition of HMS Erebus and HMS Terror to the Arctic , in 1845â€“1848 , to locate the Northwest Passage .
In the novel , while Franklin and his crew are plagued by starvation and illness , and forced to contend with mutiny and cannibalism , they are stalked across the bleak Arctic landscape by a monster .
Most of the characters featured in The Terror are actual members of Franklin 's crew , whose unexplained disappearance has warranted a great deal of speculation .
The main characters in the novel include Sir John Franklin , commander of the expedition and captain of Erebus ; Francis Crozier , captain of Terror ; Dr. Harry D. S. Goodsir ; and Captain James Fitzjames .
The Terror was nominated for the British Fantasy Award in 2008 and adapted for the first season of an eponymous television series that aired on AMC TV in 2018 .
PLOT SUMMARY Section::::Plot summary .
The novel follows a non - linear narrative structure , beginning at a point approximately midway through the overall plot .
The narrative switches among multiple viewpoint characters and uses both third- and first - person narrative ( the latter in the form of Dr. Goodsir 's diary entries ) .
The story begins in the winter of 1847 .
For more than a year , HMS Terror and HMS Erebus have been trapped in ice , 28 miles north - northwest of King William Island .
The weather has been much colder than normal , the ships ' tinned provisions are dwindling and often putrid , and the sea ice and landmasses are mysteriously devoid of any wildlife that can be hunted .
In addition to the natural dangers , the crews are being stalked and attacked by a monster resembling an immense polar bear .
In flashbacks , the novel relates some of the backstory behind the expedition 's current predicament .
The Franklin expedition is the latest in a series of attempts to forge the Northwest Passage , all of which have ended in failure .
Sir John Franklin , having been recalled in disgrace from a government posting in Van Diemen 's Land , views the expedition as his last chance for glory and recognition .
Captain Francis Crozier , embittered by romantic rejection at the hands of Franklin 's niece , seeks to distract himself by again venturing into the Arctic .
The rest of the crew have signed on for adventure .
Although the expedition begins auspiciously enough , three men die of disease during their first winter in the ice , and soon afterward , Franklin makes the fateful decision to travel around the northeast coast of King William Island , which results in the ships ' becoming trapped .
In the summer of 1847 , Franklin sends out parties in various directions across the ice , in hopes of finding open water .
None of the parties succeeds in this goal .
However , one of the parties encounters a pair of " Esquimaux " on the ice , a young woman and an old man .
They accidentally shoot the man , whereupon they are set upon by the monster , who kills Lt . Graham Gore , the leader of the party .
When the party returns to the ships , the girl follows them .
Crozier names her " Lady Silence " , as her tongue appears to have been bitten off in the past , rendering her mute .
After the Esquimaux man dies aboard Erebus , the monster begins stalking and attacking the crews .
Although the beast shows signs of intelligence , the men believe it is nothing more than an unusually aggressive bear .
This assumption leads them to underestimate the creature .
Franklin is killed in a botched attempt to bait the creature out in the open , and a number of other officers and men are killed as the months progress .
Following Franklin 's death , Crozier becomes the expedition commander , with Captain James Fitzjames assuming the role of executive officer .
Despite some initial tension between them , the two men gradually become friends as they attempt to deal with the threats of the monster , disease , and impending starvation .
By 1848 , the crews become further debilitated by the extreme cold and lack of fresh food , and the monster continues to prey on them .
An ill - fated ' morale boosting ' New Year 's Eve carnivale masque ends with a large number of the expedition , including three of the four surgeons , being killed by the monster and friendly fire from the expedition 's Royal Marines detachment .
Crozier subsequently orders punished Caulker 's Mate Cornelius Hickey ( for wearing a white polar bear costume ) and two other men ( for unbecoming behavior ) with 50 lashes of the cat o ' nine tails .
Hickey begins to plot against the officers , especially Crozier and Lt .
John Irving , who had earlier discovered Hickey copulating with another member of the crew in Terrors hold .
As spring approaches , Erebus is eventually crushed and sunk by the relentless ice .
Its remaining crew decamps to Terror for a short time , until Crozier finally orders the ship abandoned .
The expedition 's 105 survivors relocate to ' Terror Camp ' , a tented refuge on King William Island .
After ruling out an attempt to reach the far side of the Boothia Peninsula , Crozier and Fitzjames conclude that their best hope is to man - haul the lifeboats of both ships south to the Canadian mainland and then down Back 's River to an outpost on Great Slave Lake , an arduous journey of several hundred miles .
However , before they can set out , Irving is set upon and murdered by Hickey .
Hickey lays the blame for Irving 's death on a band of Esquimaux hunters whom Irving had in fact befriended , and the Esquimaux are attacked and massacred in revenge .
From this point on , the crews fear and avoid the native population .
With all hope of outside rescue eliminated , the crews begin hauling the boats across King William Island .
The trek is brutal , and many of the men die from exhaustion , exposure , and disease , including Fitzjames .
There are rumblings of mutiny from Hickey and his growing entourage , and the monster continues to appear with deadly frequency , at one point slaughtering an entire boat crew as they explore an open lead in the ice .
With no other options , and despite mounting casualties , the crew continues to press south and eventually reach a position on the southern shore of the island that they name ' Rescue Camp ' .
From there , the survivors splinter into several groups .
Hickey and his faction declare their intent to return to Terror Camp , while another group opts to return to Terror herself , despite the possibility that she has been crushed by the ice .
Crozier agrees to let them go , but later he and Goodsir are lured away from the camp and ambushed by Hickey 's men .
Crozier shoots and fatally wounds Magnus Manson , Hickey 's lover and chief crony , and is then shot and apparently killed by Hickey , while Goodsir is taken hostage .
The remainder of the crew decides to keep marching south .
All three groups eventually meet with disaster .
Hickey 's group , despite resorting to cannibalism , is stopped short of its goal by a blizzard , and most of the men either starve or freeze to death , while the remainder are murdered by Hickey , who has begun to suffer delusions of godhood .
Goodsir commits suicide by poisoning himself , ensuring that any of Hickey 's crew who eats his body will die .
The monster delivers a death blow to Hickey , but pulls away and does not consume his soul , seemingly because Hickey 's soul is befouled
( a later vision relayed to Crozier suggests that the monster will eventually become sick and die from consuming the souls of white explorers ) .
The other groups ' fates are not revealed , but it is implied that they all die as well , rendering Crozier the expedition 's sole survivor .
Crozier is rescued by Lady Silence , who treats his wounds with native medicine and brings him with her on her travels .
As he recovers from his injuries , Crozier experiences a series of dreams or visions which finally reveal the true nature of the creature .
It is called the Tuunbaq , a demon created millennia ago by the Esquimaux goddess Sedna to kill her fellow spirits , with whom she had become angry .
After a war lasting 10,000 years , the other spirits defeated the Tuunbaq , and it turned back on Sedna , who banished it to the Arctic wastes .
There , the Tuunbaq began preying on the Esquimaux , massacring them by the thousands , until their most powerful shamans discovered a way to communicate with the demon .
By sacrificing their tongues to the beast and promising to stay out of its domain , these shamans , the sixam ieua , were able to stop the Tuunbaq 's rampage .
Lady Silence is revealed to be one of these shamans , and she and Crozier eventually become lovers .
He chooses to abandon his old life and join her as a sixam ieua .
