CAREER EARLY CAREER AND FIRST OLYMPICS ( 1984–1986 )
Section::::Career .
Section::::Early career and first Olympics ( 1984–1986 ) .
Blair made her international competitive debut at the 1984 World Sprinting Championships where she placed tenth .
Later that year , Blair appeared at her first Olympic games at age 19 in Sarajevo .
Blair had not been not considered a front - runner and later recalled
she was happy just to be at the games and see her family in the stands .
She failed to medal and finished eighth in the 500 meters .
The U.S. failed to win any speed skating medals at the 1984 Olympics .
Blair trained in both short - track and long - track .
Blair won events at 1984 , 1985 and 1986 short - track world championships and was the 1986 overall short - track world champion .
A strong performance at the United States International Skating Association Metric All - Around Championships , held in West Allis , Wisconsin , earned Blair a spot on the U.S. long track women`s sprint team for the 1985 World Championships .
Blair won both the 500 meter and 1500 meter at the West Allis event , and was considered one of the U.S. team 's strongest medal contenders .
In May 1985 , at a time when U.S. speed skating lacked unity , U.S. International Speedskating Association replaced national team coach Dianne Holum with Mike Crowe .
RISE AND BECOMING AN OLYMPIC MEDALIST ( 1987–1989 ) Section::::Rise and becoming an Olympic medalist ( 1987–1989 ) .
Early in 1987 , Blair won World Cup titles in the 500 and 1,000 meters .
She followed up her World Cup titles in by setting her first world record in the 500 meters with a time 39.43 seconds .
Blair also proved she could beat East - German world champion Karin Enke - Kania in head to head match - ups .
Although Blair was four inches shorter than Enke - Kania , Blair 's technique and fast start time made her a formidable competitor .
Blair held a world record at 500 meters until December 1987
when Christa Rothenburger beat her time at the World Cup .
Blair , under the weather with a cough and cold , finished second in the event .
Overall , Blair won 4 of 18 women 's medals at the 1987 World Cup ; East German skaters , including Rothenburger , won 13 .
At the December 1987 U.S. speed skating trials for the 1988 Winter Olympics , Blair led the women 's field in the 500,1,000 , and 1,500 meters , securing her place on the U.S. Olympic team , as expected .
Blair was considered a stronger competitor in the shorter distances , where she was seen as the United States ' best chance at a gold medal in speed skating .
U.S. speed skating failure to win a single medal at the 1984 Olympics added to the pressure and attention focused on Blair leading up to the 1988 games .
Blair went on to the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary , Alberta , where her first event was the 500 meters .
Rothenburger skating first , setting a new world record .
Blair responded to the challenge with her best start ever in the 500 meters , winning the gold medal in world record time of 39.10 seconds .
For her second event of the games , Blair had a personal best and briefly set an Olympic record in the 1,000 meters .
Two of Blair 's competitors , who skated after her , subsequently beat her time ; thus Blair won the bronze in the 1,000 meters .
Blair 's third and final event of the 1988 Winter Olympics was the 1,500 meters , in which she placed fourth .
Blair 's family friends in the stands , affectionately known as the " Blair Bunch , " became a staple of her competitive career .
Despite her success at the 1988 Olympics , Blair did not enjoy a windfall from endorsements .
Holding Blair back from more advertisements was both her choice of sports , which was thought to be less marketable , and ABC 's coverage of the games , which failed to resonate with viewers .
Following the 1988 Olympics , Blair also tried track cycle racing , and was coached by former speed skater and cycling world champion Connie Paraskevin .
Cycling became part of Blair 's speed skating training as both sports utilized the same muscle groups .
She made her competitive cycling debut in June 1989 at the Sundance Juice Sparkler Grand Prix .
REPEAT OLYMPIC GOLD ( 1992 ) Section::::Repeat Olympic gold ( 1992 ) .
Blair again competed at Olympics in 1992 , this time held in Albertville , France .
Blair again won gold in the 500 meters , becoming the first woman to win the event in back to back Olympics , with a time of 40.33 seconds .
The time was slower than Blair 's time in Calgary , however , the venue in Albertville was outdoors creating conditions which were less conducive for speed skating .
The second place finisher , Ye Qiaobo of China , claimed to have been slowed down by an improper crossover from another skater .
Although Ye claimed the crossover cost her the gold , the referee 's rejected China 's protest .
Blair dedicated her gold medal to her father , Charlie , who had passed away from lung cancer two years earlier .
Charlie had dreamed of Bonnie becoming an Olympic speed skater .
In her second event , the 1,500 meters , Blair finished 21st .
The placement was due in part to the strategy of her coach , Peter Mueller ; Mueller told Blair he would give her a signal to coast if he felt she was not on pace for a podium finish , allowing her to conserve energy .
As Blair approached the final 400 meters , Mueller gave the signal .
Blair also won gold in the 1,000 meters ( 1:21.90 ) .
Her time was only .02 seconds faster than Ye .
Blair 's gold made her the most decorated U.S. woman in Winter Olympics of all time .
FINAL OLYMPICS ( 1994 ) Section::::Final Olympics ( 1994 ) .
Blair took advantage of a change of Olympic rules .
In 1986 , the International Olympic Committee voted to stage the Winter Olympics and Summer Olympics in alternating four year cycles .

At the 1994 , U.S. Olympic long - track trials at the Pettit National Ice Center , Blair set track records in the first round of the 500 meter and 1,000 meter trails .
The 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer , Norway , were a coronation of sorts for Blair : She again won gold in the 500 meters ( 39.25 ) and 1,000 ( 1:18.74 ) meters races , in dominating fashion .
Blair finished 0.36 seconds ahead of the second best time in the 500 meters , and her 1.38 second margin in the 1,000 meters race is the largest margin of victory in the history of the event .
In the process she became the first American woman to win five gold medals .
She also was the only American to have 6 medals at any Winter Olympics , a record that stood until short - track speed skater Apolo Ohno surpassed it at the 2010 Winter Olympics .
