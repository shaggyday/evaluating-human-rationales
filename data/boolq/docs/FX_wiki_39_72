In 1974 , the World Football League was formed , and a franchise originally planned for Boston , then moved to the Washington , D.C. area , wound up in Orlando as the Florida Blazers .
Despite playing before sparse crowds at the Citrus Bowl and not getting paid for weeks at a time , the Blazers won their division with a 14–6 record and qualified for the first ( and only ) WFL championship game , losing to the Birmingham Americans , 22–21 .
The franchise was relocated to San Antonio for the 1975 season , then quietly expired with the league in October of that year .
Since then , Orlando has hosted several pro teams in short - lived leagues .
In 1985 , the USFL 's Washington Federals shifted to the Citrus Bowl and were renamed the Orlando Renegades .

After the original AFL folded in 2009 , the Predators resumed play in 2010 in the new Arena Football League , reconstituted by a group of AFL and af2 franchises .
The Predators played at the city - owned Amway Center until 2013 , but in September 2013 the city of Orlando notified the Predators it was canceling their lease , because the low attendance numbers of 5,878 were in default of the lease 's minimum provisions , and because of the team 's " thin and tenuous financial performance . "
For the 2014 season , the Predators moved to the smaller CFE Arena on the University of Central Florida campus after its lease at Amway Center was revoked due to declining attendance .
With the team purchased by Westgate Resorts owner David Siegel during the 2014 season , the Predators will move back to Amway Center for the 2015 season .
