PLOT Section::::Plot .
Samuel Sayer ( Robert Morley ) and his sister Rose ( Katharine Hepburn ) are British Methodist missionaries in the village of Kungdu in German East Africa at the beginning of World War I in September 1914 .
Their mail and supplies are delivered by a small steam launch named the African Queen , helmed by the rough - and - ready Canadian boat captain Charlie Allnut ( Humphrey Bogart ) , whose coarse behavior they tolerate in a rather stiff manner .
When Charlie warns them that war has broken out between Germany and Britain , the Sayers choose to stay on , only to witness the Germans burn down the mission village and herd the villagers away .
When Samuel protests , he is beaten by a German soldier .
After the Germans leave , Samuel becomes delirious with fever and soon dies .
Charlie returns shortly afterward .
He helps Rose bury her brother , and they set off in the African Queen .
Charlie mentions to Rose that the Germans have a gunboat , the Königin Luise ( " Queen Luise " ) , which patrols a large lake downriver , effectively blocking any British attacks .
( This is based on a real boat that is still sailing , named the MV Liemba . )
Rose comes up with a plan to convert the African Queen into a torpedo boat and sink the Königin Luise .
Charlie points out that navigating the Ulanga River to get to the lake would be suicidal : to reach the lake they would have to pass a German fort and negotiate several dangerous rapids .
But Rose is insistent and eventually persuades him to go along with the plan .
During their journey down the river , Charlie , Rose and the African Queen encounter many obstacles , including the German fort and three sets of rapids .
The first set of rapids is rather easy ; they get through with minimal flooding in the boat .
But when they pass the fortress and the soldiers begin shooting at them , the bullets pierce the top of the boiler and cause one of the steam pressure hoses to disconnect from the boiler .
This causes the boat 's engine to stop .
Luckily , Charlie manages to reattach the hose to the boiler just as they are about to enter the second set of rapids .
The boat rolls and pitches crazily as it goes down the rapids , leading to more severe flooding in the boat .
However , they make it through .
While celebrating their success , the two find themselves in an embrace .
Embarrassed , they break off , but eventually succumb and strike up a relationship .
The third set of rapids comes up .
This time , there is a loud metallic clattering noise as the boat goes over the falls .
They dock on the river bank to check for damage .
When Charlie dives under the boat , he finds the propeller shaft hopelessly twisted " like a cork screw " and a blade missing from the propeller .
At first defeated , Charlie is finally roused by Rose 's technically naive but determined prodding .
Rigging up a simple forge on shore , he straightens the shaft while Rose works the makeshift bellows , welds a new blade onto the prop , and they are off again .
All appears lost when Charlie and Rose " lose the channel " and the boat becomes mired in the sprawling delta 's islets and mud amid dense reeds near the mouth of the river .
First , they try to tow the boat through the muck , only to have Charlie come out of the water covered with leeches .
All their efforts to free the African Queen fail .
With no supplies left and short of potable water , Rose and a feverish Charlie turn in , convinced they have no hope of survival .
Before going to sleep Rose prays that she and Charlie be admitted into Heaven .
As they sleep , exhausted and beaten , heavy rains falling upstream raise the river 's level and float the African Queen off of the mud and into the lake which , it turns out , is just a short distance from their location .
Once on the lake , they narrowly avoid being spotted by the Königin Luise .
The Königin Luise departs , but Charlie believes that she will return as she makes her normal rounds of the lake .
Over the next two days , Charlie and Rose convert some oxygen cylinders into torpedoes using gelatin explosives and improvised detonators that use nails as the firing pins for rifle cartridges .
They then push the torpedoes through holes cut in the bow of the African Queen as improvised spar torpedoes .
The Königin Luise returns as Charlie predicted , and Charlie and Rose steam the African Queen out onto the lake in darkness , intending to set her on a collision course with the Königin Luise before diving overboard and making their way to safety to " Kenya " on the east side of the lake .
A strong storm strikes as they head toward the Königin Luise .
Unfortunately , the torpedo holes they cut are not sealed , which allows water to pour into the African Queen , causing her to sink lower and lower .
Eventually the African Queen capsizes , throwing them both into the water .
Charlie loses sight of Rose in the storm .
Charlie is captured and taken aboard the Königin Luise , where he is questioned by the captain .
Believing Rose to have drowned , he makes no attempt to defend himself against accusations of spying , and the German captain sentences him to death by hanging .
However , Rose is captured and brought to the Königin Luise just after Charlie 's sentence is pronounced .
Charlie hollers her name in excitement that she is actually alive , but then tries to protect her by pretending not to know her .
The captain questions her , and Rose confesses the whole plot proudly , deciding they have nothing to lose anyway .
The captain sentences her to be executed as a spy , too .
Charlie asks the German captain to marry them before executing them .
After a brief marriage ceremony , the Germans prepare to hang them , but there is a sudden explosion and the Königin Luise quickly capsizes and sinks .
The Königin Luise has struck the overturned hull of the African Queen and detonated the torpedoes , still attached .
Their plan has worked after all , if a little belatedly , and the newly married couple happily swims to safety on the east shore of the lake .
CAST * Humphrey Bogart as Charlie Allnut * Katharine Hepburn as Rose Sayer * Robert Morley as Rev. Samuel Sayer * Peter Bull as the Captain of the Königin Luise * Theodore Bikel as the First Officer of the Königin Luise * Walter Gotell as the Second Officer of the Königin Luise * Peter Swanwick as the First Officer of Fort Shona * Richard Marner as the Second Officer of Fort Shona PRODUCTION Section::::Production .
Production censors objected to several aspects of the original script , which included the two characters cohabiting without the formality of marriage ( as in the book ) .
Some changes were made before the film was completed .
Another change followed the casting of Bogart ; his character 's lines in the original screenplay were rendered with a thick Cockney dialect but the script had to be completely rewritten because the actor was unable to reproduce it .
The rewrite made the character Canadian .
The film was partially financed by John and James Woolf of Romulus Films , a British company .
Michael Balcon , Honorary Adviser to the National Film Finance Corporation , advised the NFFC to refuse a loan to John Woolf 's The African Queen ( 1951 ) unless it starred John McCallum and Googie Withers , rather than Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn as Woolf wanted .
This was clearly partial as he was favouring his former Ealing Studio actors .
It was only because of Woolf 's personal intervention that he persuaded the chairman of the NFFC , Lord Reith to overrule Balcon and the film went ahead .
The Woolf brothers provided £ 250,000 and were so pleased with the completed movie that they talked John Huston into directing their next picture , Moulin Rouge ( 1952 ) .
Much of the film was shot on location in Uganda and the Congo in Africa .
This was rather novel for the time , especially for a Technicolor picture which utilized large unwieldy cameras .
The cast and crew endured sickness , and spartan living conditions during their time on location .
In one scene , Hepburn was playing an organ but had a bucket nearby because she was often sick between takes .
Bogart later bragged that he and Huston were the only ones to escape illness , which he credited to not drinking any water on location , but instead fortifying themselves from the large supply of whiskey they had brought along .
About half of the film was shot in Britain .
For instance , the scenes in which Bogart and Hepburn are seen in the water were all shot in studio tanks at Isleworth Studios , Middlesex .
These scenes were considered too dangerous to shoot in Africa .
All of the foreground plates for the process shots were also done in studio .
A myth has grown that the scenes in the reed - filled riverbank were filmed in Dalyan , Turkey .
But Katharine Hepburn 's published book ( p. 118 ) on the filming states '
We were about to head ... back to Entebbe , but John [ Huston ] wanted to get shots of Bogie and me in the miles of high reeds before we come out into the lake ... " .
The reeds sequence was thus shot on location in Africa ( Uganda and Congo ) and London studios .
Most of the action takes place aboard a boat – the African Queen of the title – and scenes on board the boat were filmed using a large raft with a mockup of the boat on top .
Sections of the boat set could be removed to make room for the large Technicolor camera .
This proved hazardous on one occasion when the boat 's boiler – a heavy copper replica – almost fell on Hepburn .
It was not bolted down because it also had to be moved to accommodate the camera .
The small steam - boat used in the film to depict the African Queen was built in 1912 , in Britain , for service in Africa .
At one time it was owned by actor Fess Parker .
In December 2011 , plans were announced to restore the boat .
Restoration was completed by the following April and the African Queen is now on display as a tourist attraction at Key Largo , Florida .
Because of the dangers involved with shooting the rapid scenes , a small - scale model was used in the studio tank in London .
The vessel used to portray the German gunboat Königin Luise in the film was the steam tug Buganda , owned and operated on Lake Victoria by the East African Railways and Harbours Corporation .
Although fictional , the Königin Luise was inspired by the German First World War vessel Graf Goetzen ( also known as Graf von Goetzen ) , which operated on Lake Tanganyika until she was scuttled in 1916 during the Battle for Lake Tanganyika .
The British refloated the Graf Goetzen in 1924 and placed her in service on Lake Tanganyika in 1927 as the passenger ferry MV Liemba , and she remains in active service there as of 2015 .
The name ' SS Königin Luise ' was taken from a German steam ferry which operated from Hamburg , before being taken over by the Kaiserliche Marine on the outbreak of the First World War .
She was used as an auxiliary minelayer off Harwich before being sunk on 5 August 1914 by the cruiser HMS Amphion .
A persistent rumour regarding London 's population of feral Ring Necked Parakeets is that they originated from birds escaped or released from the filming of this movie .
This claim was initially considered dubious though it was given more credence when a zoologist admitted her grandparents fed them .
PREMIERE
Section::::Premiere .
The African Queen opened on December 26 , 1951 at the Fox Wilshire Theatre in Beverly Hills , in order to qualify for the 1951 Oscars .
Its New York City opening was on February 20 , 1952 at the Capitol Theatre .
RECEPTION AND BOX OFFICE
Section::::Reception and box office .
Contemporary reviews from critics were mostly positive .
Upon the film 's premiere , Edwin Schallert of the Los Angeles Times wrote that it " should impress for its novelty both in casting and scenically , " and found the ending " rather contrived and even incredible , but melodramatic enough , with almost a western accent , to be popularly effective . "
Bosley Crowther of The New York Times called the film " a slick job of movie hoodwinking with a thoroughly implausible romance , set in a frame of wild adventure that is as whopping as its tale of off - beat love ...
This is not noted with disfavor .
"
Crowther added that " Mr. Huston merits credit for putting this fantastic tale on a level of sly , polite kidding and generally keeping it there , while going about the happy business of engineering excitement and visual thrills . "
Variety called it " an engrossing motion picture ...
Performance - wise , Bogart has never been seen to better advantage .
Nor has he ever had a more knowing , talented film partner than Miss Hepburn . "
John McCarten of The New Yorker declared that " Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart come up with a couple of remarkable performances , and it 's fortunate that they do , for the movie concentrates on them so single - mindedly that any conspicuous uncertainty in their acting would have left the whole thing high and dry . "
Richard L. Coe wrote in the March 8 , 1952 edition of The Washington Post that " Huston has tried a risky trick and most of the time pulls it off in delicious style .
And from both his stars he has drawn performances which have rightly been nominated for those Academy Awards on the [ 20th ] . "
Harrison 's Reports printed a negative review , writing that the film " has its moments of comedy and excitement , but on the whole the dialogue is childish , the action silly , and the story bereft of human appeal .
The characters act as childishly as they talk , and discriminating picture - goers will , no doubt , laugh at them .
There is nothing romantic about either Katharine Hepburn or Humphrey Bogart , for both look bedraggled throughout . "
The Monthly Film Bulletin was also negative , writing : " Huston seems to have been aiming at a measured , quiet , almost digressive tempo , but the material does not support it , and would have benefited by the incisiveness his previous films have shown .
In spite of Hepburn 's wonderful playing , and some engaging scenes , the film must be accounted a misfire . "
The film earned an estimated £ 256,267 at UK cinemas in 1952 , making it the 11th most popular movie of the year .
It earned an estimated $ 4 million in US and Canadian theatrical rentals .

Though intended as the pilot for a series , it was not picked up .
An elliptic commentary on the making of The African Queen can be found in the 1990 film White Hunter Black Heart , directed by Clint Eastwood .
The African Queen was part of the inspiration for the Jungle Cruise attraction at Disneyland in California .
Imagineer Harper Goff referenced the African Queen frequently in his ideas ; even his designs of the ride vehicles were inspired by the steamer used in the film .
THE AFRICAN QUEEN Section::::The African Queen .
The boat used as the African Queen is actually the L.S. Livingston which had been a working diesel boat for 40 years ; the steam engine was a prop and the real diesel engine was hidden under stacked crates of gin and other cargo .
Florida attorney and Humphrey Bogart enthusiast , Jim Hendricks Sr . came to own the boat in 1982 in Key Largo , FL .
After falling into a state of disrepair following the death Hendricks Sr . in 2001 , the vessel was spotted gathering rust in a Florida marina in 2012 by Suzanne Holmquist and her engineer husband , Lance .
The couple have since repaired the ailing ship and opened it up to tourists and film enthusiasts , providing cruises around the Florida Keys aboard the famous vessel .
