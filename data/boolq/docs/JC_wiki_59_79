On February 24 , 2015 , Paige announced Total Divas was renewed for a fourth season , with filming commencing at the end of the month .
It was then announced at the end of the season three finale , that the fourth season would premiere on July 7 , 2015 , moving from Sunday to Tuesday nights .
Unlike other WWE programs , most of the performers use their real names instead of their ring names , leading to Cameron , Naomi , Natalya , Jimmy Uso , and Tyson Kidd being referred to as Ariane , Trinity , Nattie , Jon , and TJ respectively .
On April 1 , 2015 , E ! announced the show had been renewed for a fourth season via a press release .
In the press release , it was confirmed that Naomi would return as a series regular with Cameron and Rosa Mendes being removed from the main cast .
All of the other divas would return as series regulars .
On September 5 , 2015 , an online article states that there could be a strong possibility Total Divas will be renewed for a fifth season .
It reads that season four will " wrap up this fall " and the new season " wo n't air till 2016 some time " .
On September 9 , 2015 , Naomi revealed on Twitter that she had been taken off the main cast after the mid - season finale , which aired on September 29 .
Season four may be extended following the mid - season hiatus instead of jumping to season five .
There has been speculation that WWE Tough Enough runner - up Amanda Saccomanno may join the cast after the mid - season hiatus .
It was later confirmed that Amanda will be joining the cast for season 5 .
After the September 22 episode of Total Divas aired , it was announced that next weeks episode would serve as the season finale , rather than a mid - season finale , so the show will jump to a fifth season following the conclusion of season four .
