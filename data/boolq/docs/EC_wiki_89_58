DELAY OF GAME ( ICE HOCKEY )
Delay of game is a penalty in ice hockey .
It results in the offending player spending two minutes in the penalty box .
In the NHL , delay of game is usually called under seven circumstances : * A player or goaltender intentionally shoots or throws the puck out of the playing area .
* * A defensive player in the defensive zone shoots the puck directly ( without being deflected ) over the glass .
This penalty only applies if the player shoots it over the glass .
If the puck is shot into the bench , no penalty is assessed .
* * A player or goaltender intentionally knocks the net 's goalpost off its moorings , which stops the play .
If the net is intentionally knocked loose during a breakaway , the breakaway player is awarded a penalty shot .
If there is not enough time in the game to serve the full delay of game penalty , the last player to take a shot is also awarded a penalty shot .
* * The Player or goalie intentionally keeps the puck behind the net for more than a minute *
* The goaltender freezes the puck rather than passing it on to a teammate when no player on the opposing team is within sufficient distance to apply offensive pressure to him .
*
*
Any skater other than the goaltender uses their hands to make the puck unplayable ( in some leagues , this is called " closing hand on puck " ) .
*
* Fans begin to throw objects onto the ice or disrupt the game .
*
* Beginning from the 2017 - 18 NHL season , an unsuccessful coach 's challenge for offside results in the challenging team being assessed a bench minor for delay of game .
* Delay of game penalties may also be assessed as a bench minor penalty ( a minor penalty against the entire team rather than a specific player ) .
These may be called if the team repeatedly engages in actions that postpone resumption of play ( for example , being offsides before the faceoff ) or if objects are thrown onto the ice that impede the progress of the game - traditional celebratory actions such as the throwing of hats onto the ice after a player records a hat trick are usually exempt from this rule .
