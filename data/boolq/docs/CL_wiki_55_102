BOND PAPER Bond paper is a high quality durable writing paper similar to bank paper but having a weight greater than 50 g / m .
The most common weights are 60 g / m ( 16 lb ) , 75 g / m ( 20 lb ) and 90 g / m ( 24 lb ) .
The name comes from its having originally been made for documents such as government bonds .
It is now used for letterheads and other stationery and as paper for electronic printers .
Widely employed for graphic work involving pencil , pen and felt - tip marker , bond paper can sometimes contain rag fibre pulp , which produces a stronger , though rougher , sheet of paper .
