The cities of Portland , Beaverton , Tigard , Oregon City , Salem , and Independence , as well as Multnomah County , have statutes which do not allow open carry of loaded firearms ( unless one has a concealed carry permit ) .
} CONCEALED AND OPEN CARRY Section::::Concealed and open carry .
Oregon is a shall - issue concealed - carry state .
and is notable for having very few restrictions on where a concealed firearm may be carried .
Oregon also has statewide preemption for its concealed - carry laws â€” with limited exceptions , counties and cities can not place limits on the ability of people to carry concealed weapons beyond those provided by state law .
There is one possible exception to the " shall issue " state .
The concealed - carry license is issued by each county 's sheriff , and is valid statewide .
The sheriff is given personal discretion if that sheriff " has reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant has been or is reasonably likely to be a danger to self or others .
" There is no pure definition of what that reason must be .
For instance it might be a statement from another law enforcement officer about an individual , and that statement might come from personal acquaintance .
The burden , and perhaps the right to recover damages would then be on the applicant .
There is no reciprocity with other states ' concealed handgun licenses .
Individuals wanting to carry a concealed handgun in Oregon will need an Oregon Concealed Handgun License .
Oregon is also an open - carry state , but cities and counties are free to limit public possession of loaded firearms by individuals who do not have an Oregon Concealed Handgun License .
The cities of Portland , Beaverton , Tigard , Oregon City , Salem , and Independence , as well as Multnomah County have banned loaded firearms in all public places for those without a license .
