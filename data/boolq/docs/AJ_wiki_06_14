FRANCHISE HISTORY
EARLY YEARS ( 1992–1998 ) Section::::Franchise history .
Section::::Early years ( 1992–1998 ) .
In the late 1980s , the NHL announced it would expand .
Two rival groups from the Tampa Bay Area decided to bid for a franchise : a St. Petersburg - based group fronted by future Hartford Whalers / Carolina Hurricanes owners Peter Karmanos and Jim Rutherford , and a Tampa - based group fronted by two Hall of Famers — Phil Esposito and his brother Tony .
One of Esposito 's key backers , the Pritzker family , backed out a few months before the bid , to be replaced by a consortium of Japanese businesses headed by Kokusai Green , a golf course and resort operator .
On paper , it looked like the Karmanos / Rutherford group was the more stable bid , however , the group wanted to pay only $ 29 million before starting play , while the Esposito group was one of the few groups willing to pay the $ 50 million expansion fee up front .
The Esposito group would win the expansion franchise , and name the team the Lightning , after Tampa Bay 's status as the " Lightning Capital of North America " .
After being awarded the franchise , Phil Esposito installed himself as president and general manager , while Tony became chief scout .
Terry Crisp , who played for the Philadelphia Flyers when they won two Stanley Cups in the mid-1970s and coached the Calgary Flames to a Stanley Cup in 1989 , was tapped as the first head coach .
Phil Esposito would also hire former teammates from the Boston Bruins of the 1970s ; he hired former linemate Wayne Cashman as an assistant coach , former Bruin trainer
John " Frosty " Forristal as the team 's trainer and the inaugural team photo has him flanked by Cashman and player Ken Hodge , Jr. , son of his other Bruins ' linemate .
The team turned heads in the pre - season when Manon Rheaume became the first woman to play in an NHL game , which also made her the first woman to play in any of the major professional North American sports leagues ; she played for the Lightning against the St. Louis Blues , and stopped seven of nine shots .
The Lightning 's first regular season game took place on October 7 , 1992 , playing in Tampa 's tiny 11,000-seat Expo Hall at the Florida State Fairgrounds .
They shocked the visiting Chicago Blackhawks 7–3 with four goals by little - known Chris Kontos .
The Lightning shot to the top of the Campbell Conference 's Norris Division within a month , behind Kontos ' initial torrid scoring pace and a breakout season by forward Brian Bradley .
However , they buckled under the strain of some of the longest road trips in the NHL — their nearest division rival , the Blues , were over 1,000 miles away — and finished in last place with a record of 23–54–7 for 53 points .
This was , at the time , one of the best - ever showings by an NHL expansion team .
Bradley 's 42 goals gave Tampa Bay fans optimism for the next season ; it would be a team record until the 2006–07 season .
The following season saw the Lightning shift to the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division , as well as move into the Florida Suncoast Dome ( a building originally designed for baseball ) in St. Petersburg , which was reconfigured for hockey and renamed " the ThunderDome .
"
The team acquired goaltender Daren Puppa , left - wing goal scorer Petr Klima and Denis Savard .
While Puppa 's play resulted in a significant improvement in goals allowed ( from 332 to 251 ) , Savard was long past his prime and
Klima 's scoring was offset by his defensive lapses .
The Lightning finished last in the Atlantic Division in 1993–94 with a record of 30–43–11 for 71 points .
Another disappointing season followed in the lockout - shortened 1995 season with a record of 17–28–3 for 37 points .
ON - ICE AND OFF - ICE
STRUGGLES Section::::On - ice and off - ice struggles .
In their fourth season , 1995–96 , with Bradley still leading the team in scoring , second - year forward Alexander Selivanov scoring a total of 31 goals , and Roman Hamrlik having an All - Star year on defense , the Lightning finally qualified for the playoffs , nosing out the defending Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils with a record of 38–33–12 with 88 points for the eighth spot in the Eastern Conference by a single win .
Due to his stellar play in net , Puppa was named a finalist for the Vezina Trophy ( losing out to Jim Carey of the Washington Capitals ) .
Set to play the Stanley Cup contending Philadelphia Flyers , the Lighting would split the opening two games in Philadelphia before taking a 2 - 1 series lead in overtime before a ThunderDome crowd of 28,183 .
This was the largest crowd for an NHL game , a record that stood until the 2003 Heritage Classic in Edmonton .
An injury to Puppa in that game , however , would see the Lightning lose the next three games and the series .
The Lightning acquired goalscorer Dino Ciccarelli from the Detroit Red Wings during the 1996 off - season , and he did not disappoint , scoring 35 goals in the 1996–97 season , with Chris Gratton notching another 30 goals .
The team moved into a glittering new arena , the Ice Palace ( now Amalie Arena ) , and appeared destined for another playoff spot .
However , the Lightning suffered a devastating rash of injuries .
Puppa developed back trouble that kept him out of all but four games during the season ; he would only play a total of 50 games from 1996 until his retirement in 2000 .
Bradley also lost time to a series of concussions that would limit him to a total of 49 games from 1996 until his retirement in December 1999 .
Center John Cullen developed non - Hodgkin lymphoma , and missed the last 12 games of the 1996–97 season ; he would eventually be forced to retire in 1999 .
Decimated by these ailments , the Lightning narrowly missed the playoffs .
Most of the Lightning 's early stars were gone by 1998 due to free agency and a series of ill - advised trades .
Crisp was fired 11 games into the 1997–98 season and replaced by Jacques Demers .
Though Demers had presided over the resurgence of the Detroit Red Wings in the 1980s and helmed a Stanley Cup run with the Montreal Canadiens in 1993 , he was unable to change the team 's fortunes and the Lightning ended up losing 55 games .
By most accounts , the Lightning 's plunge to the bottom of the NHL was due to inattentive ownership by Kokusai Green .
Rumors abounded as early as the team 's second season that the Lightning were on the brink of bankruptcy and that the team was part of a money laundering scheme for the yakuza ( Japanese crime families ) .
Its scouting operation consisted of Tony Esposito and several satellite dishes .
The Internal Revenue Service investigated the team in 1994 and 1995 , and nearly threatened to put a tax lien on the team for $ 750,000 in back taxes .
The situation led longtime NHL broadcaster and writer Stan Fischler to call the Lightning a " skating vaudeville show " .
Even in their first playoff season , the team was awash in red ink and Kokusai Green was looking to sell the team , however its asking price of $ 230 million for the team and the lease with the Ice Palace deterred buyers .
A possible sale was further hampered by the team 's murky ownership structure ; even some team officials ( including Crisp ) did not know who really owned the team .
Takashi Okubo , the owner of Kokusai Green , had never met with the Espositos or with NHL officials in person prior to being awarded the Lightning franchise , and had never watched his team play or visited the city of Tampa .
Nearly all of Kokusai Green 's investment in the team and the Ice Palace came in the form of loans , leaving the team constantly short of cash .
At least one prospective buyer pulled out after expressing doubts that Okubo even existed .
In fact , the first time anyone connected with the Lightning or the NHL even saw Okubo was in the spring of 1998 .
Many of Esposito 's trades came simply to keep the team above water .
The team 's financial situation was a considerable concern to NHL officials ; rumors surfaced that the league was seriously considering taking control of the team if Okubo failed to find a buyer by the summer of 1998 .
Forbes wrote an article in late 1997 calling the Lightning a financial nightmare , with a debt equal to 236 % of its value , the highest of any major North American sports franchise .
Even though the Ice Palace was built for hockey and the Lightning were the only major tenant , Forbes called the team 's deal with the arena a lemon since it would not result in much revenue for 30 years .
It was also behind on paying state sales taxes and federal payroll taxes .
Finally , in 1998 , Kokusai Green found a buyer .
Although Detroit Pistons owner William Davidson was thought to be the frontrunner , the buyer turned out to be insurance tycoon and motivational speaker Art Williams , who previously owned the Birmingham Barracudas of the Canadian Football League ( CFL ) .
The team was $ 102 million in debt at the time the sale closed .
Williams knew very little about hockey , but was very visible and outspoken , and immediately pumped an additional $ 6 million into the team 's payroll .
He also cleared most of the debt from the Kokusai Green era .
After taking control , Williams publicly assured the Espositos that their jobs were safe , only to fire them two games into the 1998–99 season .
He then gave Demers complete control of hockey operations as both coach and general manager .
The Lightning drafted Vincent Lecavalier in 1998 , a player who would be a cornerstone of the team for years to come .
Williams was widely seen as being in over his head and was an easy target for his NHL colleagues , who called him " Jed Clampett " behind his back due to his thick Southern accent and fundamentalist Christian views .
Early in the 1998–99 season , the Lightning lost ten games in a row , all but ending any chance of making the playoffs .
They ended up losing 54 games that year , more than the expansion Nashville Predators .
VINCENT LECAVALIER AND MARTIN ST .
LOUIS ERA ( 1998–2013 ) RETURN TO RESPECTABILITY Section::::Vincent Lecavalier and Martin St. Louis
era ( 1998–2013 ) .
Section::::Return to respectability .
By the spring of 1999 , Williams had seen enough .
He had not attended a game in some time because " this team broke my heart " .
He lost $ 20 million in the 1998–99 season alone , as much money in one year as he had estimated he could have reasonably lost in five years .
Williams sold the team for $ 115 million—$2 million less than he had paid for the team a year earlier — to Detroit Pistons owner William Davidson , who had almost bought the team a year earlier .
Along with the sale , the Lightning acquired a new top minor league affiliate ; Davidson also owned the Detroit Vipers of the now - defunct International Hockey League .
Davidson remained in Detroit , but appointed Tom Wilson as team president to handle day - to - day management of the team .
Wilson immediately fired Jacques Demers , who despite his best efforts ( and fatherly attitude toward Vincent Lecavalier ) was unable to overcome the damage from the Kokusai Green ownership .
Wilson persuaded Ottawa Senators general manager ( and former Vipers GM )
Rick Dudley to take over as the Lightning 's new general manager ; Dudley , in turn , brought Vipers coach Steve Ludzik in as the team 's new head coach .
Wilson , Dudley and Ludzik had helped make the Vipers one of the premier minor league hockey franchises , having won a Turner Cup in only their third season in Detroit ( the team had originally been based in Salt Lake City ) .
However , as had been the case with Demers ,
the damage from the last few seasons under Kokusai Green was too much for Ludzik to overcome .
Even with a wholesale transfer of talent from Detroit to Tampa ( a move that eventually doomed the Vipers , which folded along with the IHL in 2001 ) , the Lightning lost 54 games in 1999–2000 and 52 in 2000–01 , becoming the first team in NHL history to post four straight 50-loss seasons .
The lone bright spots in those years were the blossoming of Vincent Lecavalier and Brad Richards into NHL stars .
Ludzik was replaced in early 2001 by career NHL assistant John Tortorella .
The March 5 trade deadline offered another glimmer of hope when the team acquired hold - out goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin from the Phoenix Coyotes for three players and a draft pick .
The 2001–02 season , Tortorella 's first full year behind the bench , saw some improvement .
Martin St. Louis was having a breakout season when he broke his leg in game number 47 and was lost for the remainder of the season .
Khabibulin recorded a shut out at the NHL
All - Star Game but was not named its MVP , by all accounts due to the game 's voting protocol .
By mid - February , the Lightning were well out of playoff contention and were sinking under a rash of injuries .
Dudley , who had guaranteed a playoff berth before the season , was fired and replaced by his assistant , Jay Feaster .
Still the Lightning showed some signs of life , earning more than 60 points for the first time since 1997 .
Tortorella stripped Lecavalier of the captaincy due to contract negotiations that had made the young center miss the start of the season .
TWO DREAM SEASONS AND THE STANLEY CUP Section::::Two dream seasons and the Stanley Cup .
With a young core of players led by Vincent Lecavalier , Brad Richards , Martin St. Louis and Fredrik Modin , the Lightning were thought to be very close to respectability .
However , they arrived somewhat earlier than expected in 2002–03 .
The young team was led by the goaltending of Nikolai Khabibulin and the scoring efforts of Lecavalier , St. Louis , Modin , Richards and Ruslan Fedotenko , and also boasted a new captain , former prolific scorer Dave Andreychuk .
Throughout the season , the Lightning battled the Washington Capitals for first place in the Southeast Division .
They finished with a record of 36–25–16 for 93 points , breaking the 90-point barrier for the first time in team history .
They won the division by just one point , giving them home - ice advantage in their first round match - up with the Capitals .
At season 's end , coach Tortorella was recognized for his efforts by being named a finalist for the Jack Adams Award , losing out to Jacques Lemaire of the Minnesota Wild .
In the first round of the playoffs , the Lightning quickly fell two games behind in the series but followed the two losses with four consecutive wins which advanced them to the Conference Semi - finals for the first time in team history .
In the semi - finals , the Lightning won only one game , losing the series to the New Jersey Devils , who went on to win the Stanley Cup .
The Lightning 's dramatic improvement continued through the 2003–04 regular season , finishing with a record of 46–22–8–6 for 106 points , second - best in the NHL after the Western Conference 's Detroit Red Wings — the first 100-point season in franchise history .
The Lightning went through the season with only 20-man - games lost to injury .
In the first round of the playoffs , the Lightning ousted the Alexei Yashin - led New York Islanders in five games , with solid play from goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin , who posted three shutouts in Games 1 , 3 and 4 .
In the second round , the Lightning faced the Montreal Canadiens , captained by Saku Koivu ; Lecavalier , Richards , and Khabibulin led the team to a four - game sweep of Montreal .
They next faced Keith Primeau and his Philadelphia Flyers in the Conference Finals .
After a tightly - fought seven - game series in which neither team was able to win consecutive games , Fredrik Modin notched the winning goal of the seventh and deciding game , earning the Eastern Conference championship for the Lightning and their first - ever berth in the Stanley Cup Finals .
Their opponent in the final round was the Calgary Flames , captained by Jarome Iginla .
The final round also went the full seven games , with the deciding game played in the St. Pete Times Forum on June 7 , 2004 .
This time , Ruslan Fedotenko was the Game 7 hero , scoring both Lightning goals in a 2–1 victory .
Brad Richards , who had 26 points in the post - season , won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs ; the Lightning had won all 31 contests in which he had scored a goal since the opening of the season .
Tortorella won the Jack Adams Award as the NHL 's Coach of the Year .
Only three years after their last of four consecutive seasons of 50 or more losses , and in only their 12th year of existence , the Lightning became the southernmost team ever to win the Stanley Cup .
Martin St. Louis led the team and the NHL with 94 points ( his 38 goals were fourth - most after the 41 of tied trio Jarome Iginla , Rick Nash and Ilya Kovalchuk ) , and won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL 's most valuable player .
St. Louis also won the Lester B. Pearson Award for the NHL 's most outstanding player as voted by the NHL Players ' Association , and tied the Vancouver Canucks ' Marek Malik for the NHL Plus / Minus Award .
A season of superlatives was capped with one final accolade , as The Sporting News named GM Jay Feaster as the league 's executive of the year for 2003–04 .
The Lightning had to wait a year to defend their title due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout , but in 2005–06 , they barely made the playoffs with a record of 43–33–6 for 93 points in a conference where six teams notched 100 or more points .
They lost to the Ottawa Senators in five games in the first round of the 2006 playoffs .
DISAPPOINTMENTS AND REBUILDING Section::::Disappointments and rebuilding .
During the off - season , the Lightning traded Fredrik Modin and Fredrik Norrena to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for goaltender Marc Denis in an effort to replace the departing John Grahame , who had signed with the Carolina Hurricanes .
However , free agent Johan Holmqvist would eventually receive the majority of playing time and most of the club 's wins .
The first half of 2006–07 was inconsistent for the Lightning , maintaining an 18–19–2 record throughout the first few months .
January and February were far better months for the team , going 9–4–0 in January and 9–2–2 in February , driving them back into the playoff race .
Fourteen games in March were split even , and on March 16 , 2007 , Vincent Lecavalier broke the franchise record for most points in a season , with 95 ( finishing with 108 ) .
The record was previously held by Martin St. Louis , who had set the record in the 2003–04 Stanley Cup - winning year .
Lecavalier also broke the franchise 's goal scoring record , finishing with a league - leading 52 goals .
The Lightning were busy during the final weeks before the NHL 's trade deadline , acquiring wingers Kyle Wanvig , Stephen Baby and defenseman Shane O'Brien .
Former first round pick Nikita Alexeev was traded on deadline day to the Chicago Blackhawks .
Other mid - season additions to the team included Filip Kuba , Luke Richardson and Doug Janik .
Veteran Andre Roy , who had won the Stanley Cup with the Lightning in 2004 , was claimed off waivers from the Pittsburgh Penguins .
Throughout March , the Lightning had been competing with the Atlanta Thrashers for first place in the Southeast Division .
With a chance to overtake the Thrashers one final time and once again become division champions for the third time in team history , on April 6 , 2007 , in the final week of the regular season , the Lighting suffered a loss to the Florida Panthers , the night before the season finale in Atlanta .
That same night , the Thrashers defeated the Carolina Hurricanes and subsequently clinched the division .
For the Lightning , this meant having to settle for the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference with a final record of 44–33–5 ( 93 points ) .
However , the Lightning were eliminated from playoff competition on April 22 after a 3–2 home loss to the New Jersey Devils in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals .
Following their playoff exit , on August 7 , 2007 , Absolute Hockey Enterprises , a group led by Doug MacLean , announced it had signed a purchase agreement for the team and the leasehold on the St. Pete Times Forum .
MacLean is the former president and general manager of the Columbus Blue Jackets and former head coach for both the Blue Jackets and the Florida Panthers .
The group announced it planned to keep the team in Tampa , but the deal collapsed during the 2007–08 season .
The Lightning struggled to maintain success during the 2007–08 campaign .
Although the " Big 3 " of Vincent Lecavalier , Martin St. Louis and Brad Richards , along with Vaclav Prospal , had performed up to expectations , they had little consistent play from supporting players .
At the start of the All - Star Break on January 25 , 2008 , the Lightning had a 20–25–5 record , and with 45 points , were in last place in both the Southeast Division and the Eastern Conference .
Only the Los Angeles Kings had a lower point total at this time of the season , with 40 points .
On February 13 , 2008 , it was announced that Palace Sports & Entertainment had agreed to sell the Lightning to OK Hockey LLC , a group headed by Oren Koules , a producer of the Saw horror movies , and Len Barrie , a former NHL player and real estate developer .
The Lightning were active during the trade deadline , similar to the previous season .
More notable trades included Vaclav Prospal 's trade to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for prospect Alexandre Picard and a conditional draft pick .
Additionally , former Conn Smythe Trophy winner Brad Richards and goaltender Johan Holmqvist were traded to the Dallas Stars in exchange for goaltender Mike Smith and forwards Jussi Jokinen and Jeff Halpern , as well as a fourth - round draft pick in 2009 .
Jan Hlavac , a regular contributor , was also traded , moving to the Nashville Predators in exchange for a seventh - round pick in 2008 .
Defenseman Dan Boyle was re - signed to a six - year contract extension reportedly worth $ 40 million .
However , after the trade deadline , the Lightning fared no better than they had throughout the entire season .
After the February 26 trade deadline , the Lightning won only five games .
Finishing with a 31–42–9 record , with 71 points , they had the highest chance of winning the top overall pick in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft through the draft lottery , which they eventually won on April 7 .
They would use their first overall pick to select Steven Stamkos of the Ontario Hockey League ( OHL ) 's Sarnia Sting .
The Lightning were the worst team on the road in the NHL , winning only 11 games .
Another showing of the team 's poor play was the difference from the previous season 's success in the overtime / shootout periods .
In the 2006–07 season , the Lightning had one of the best extra period records , winning 15 games in either overtime or the shootout .
However , in the 2007–08 season , they won only three games , losing nine .
Vincent Lecavalier suffered a dislocated shoulder as the result of an open - ice hit from Matt Cooke of the Washington Capitals in the game before the season finale in Atlanta .
Lecavalier , who planned on having arthroscopic wrist surgery after the season 's ending , would undergo surgery to repair his right shoulder as well .
Cooke was fined $ 2,500 by the NHL for the hit , as Lecavalier did not have possession of the puck at the time .
Perhaps the lone bright spot in the season was Lecavalier 's winning both the King Clancy Memorial Trophy and the NHL Foundation Player Award for work through his foundation , including a $ 3 million pledge to All Children 's Hospital in St. Petersburg , Florida , for what would become the Vincent Lecavalier Pediatric Cancer and Blood Disorders Center at All Children 's Hospital .
Head coach John Tortorella was fired by the Lightning following their worst season since Tortorella was hired .
At the time working as an NHL analyst for ESPN , Barry Melrose stated on June 4 during an episode of Pardon the Interruption that he missed coaching and would entertain any NHL coaching offers .
He stated , " I miss not having a dog in the fight . "
On June 23 , ESPN reported Melrose had been chosen to be the head coach of the Lightning , beginning in 2008–09 .
The next day , the Lightning officially introduced him as their new head coach .
On July 4 , 2008 , Dan Boyle , despite coming off a recent contract extension , was traded ( along with Brad Lukowich ) to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for Matt Carle , Ty Wishart , a first - round draft pick in 2009 and a fourth - round pick in 2010 .
Boyle was pressured to waive his no - trade clause by Tampa Bay 's ownership , who said they would otherwise place him on waivers , where he would likely be claimed by the Atlanta Thrashers .
In the fallout from the trade , Boyle would call Lightning ownership " liars " for misrepresenting the aforementioned events to the public , while former coach Tortorella later labeled them as " cowboys " and said he had zero respect for them .
Frustrated at interference in the team 's hockey operations by Barrie and Koules , seven days later , Jay Feaster resigned as general manager , despite having three years remaining on his contract .
The Lightning opened the 2008–09 season in the Czech Republic against the New York Rangers as a part of the NHL 's regular season " Premiere " that selects several teams to open the regular season in Europe .
Barry Melrose would record his first win as a head coach in over 13 years on October 21 , 2008 , with a 3–2 victory over the Atlanta Thrashers .
However , the Lightning did not get off to a great start as hoped , and Melrose was eventually fired by the Lightning with a 5–7–4 record .
Rick Tocchet , who had been hired as assistant coach during the previous off - season , was promoted to interim head coach .
On March 4 , veterans Mark Recchi and Olaf Kolzig were traded by the Tampa Bay Lightning to the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs , respectively .
The Lightning acquired top round picks
Matt Lashoff and Martins Karsums from the Bruins .
After the firing of Melrose , the Lightning went 19–33–14 and would finish the season 24–40–18 with 66 points , their lowest point total since the 2000–01 season .
With the second overall pick in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft , the Lightning selected Swedish defenseman Victor Hedman .
In the 2009 off - season , the Lightning removed the interim status of Rick Tocchet , making him the full - time head coach and signing him to a multi - year contract .
The Lightning had an up - and - down beginning to the 2009–10 campaign .
Despite an overmatched roster on paper , and a team that struggled in the first two periods of many games , the Lightning remained competitive in the playoff race until March , when they went 5–10–1 for the month and fell eight points out of a playoff spot .
Unable to make a final push for the playoffs , they were officially eliminated from contention within the first week of April .
The Lightning finished the season 34–36–12 for 80 points , fourth in the Southeast Division and 12th in the Eastern Conference .
Steven Stamkos scored 51 goals in just his second NHL season , earning himself a share of the Maurice " Rocket " Richard Trophy by finishing tied for the NHL lead in goals with Pittsburgh Penguins star Sidney Crosby .
During the season , the team was sold to Bostonian investment banker Jeffrey Vinik .
Following the late - season collapse , Vinik cleaned house , firing both head coach Rick Tocchet and GM Brian Lawton on April 12 , 2010 , one day after the season ended .
In May 2010 , Vinik hired Steve Yzerman away from the Detroit Red Wings front office to be the new GM , signing him to a five - year contract .
Yzerman then hired Guy Boucher away from the Montreal Canadiens organization to succeed Tocchet as the head coach two weeks later .
Yzerman 's first off - season with Tampa Bay began with a splash .
With the sixth pick of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft , the Lightning selected forward Brett Connolly despite a history of injuries while playing for the Western Hockey League ( WHL ) 's Prince George Cougars .
When asked about Connolly 's injuries being a factor in the decision to draft him , Yzerman boldly declared , " I think it was a factor that he was available with the 6th pick .
Because if he had been healthy all year , based on everything I know , he would not have been available with the 6th pick . "
On July 1 , 2010 , veteran blueliner Andrej Meszaros was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for their second - round pick in 2011 .
Later that day , the Lightning signed star winger Martin St. Louis to a four - year , $ 22.5 million contract extension to come into effect on July 1 , 2011 .
On July 19 , in another move with the Flyers organization , the Lightning traded defenseman Matt Walker and Tampa Bay 's fourth - round pick in 2011 for high - scoring winger Simon Gagne .
Other off - season acquisitions included the signing of forwards Sean Bergenheim , Dominic Moore and Marc - Antoine Pouliot , along with defensemen Brett Clark , Randy Jones and Pavel Kubina and goaltender Dan Ellis , as well as the re - signing of restricted free agent forward Steve Downie to a two - year , $ 3.7 million deal .
END OF THE LECAVALIER / ST .
LOUIS ERA Section::::End of the Lecavalier / St .
Louis era .
With starting goaltender Mike Smith injured , the Lightning called up Cedrick Desjardins , who played with a .950 save percentage and a 1.00 goals against average ( GAA ) in two games .
The team then acquired veteran Dwayne Roloson from the New York Islanders for further coverage in net .
The Lightning compiled a 46–25–11 record with 103 points in the 2010–11 season , matching a franchise record for wins in a season .
After holding the first place in the Southeast Division for several months , they fell to second after a poor performance in March .
However , their record was solid enough for second in the Southeast Division and fifth in the Eastern Conference , and they returned to the playoffs for the first time since the 2006–07 season .
Scoring 31 goals and assisting on 68 , Martin St. Louis finished second in the NHL in points .
In the playoffs , Tampa Bay drew the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Conference Quarterfinals .
After losing Game 4 at home in the second overtime period , they fell behind in the series one game to three .
However , the Lightning went on to win the next three games , including a 1–0 Game 7 win on the road , taking their first playoff series since winning the Stanley Cup in 2004 .
In the Conference Semi - finals , the Lightning swept the top - seeded Washington Capitals .
Tampa Bay went up against the Boston Bruins in the Eastern Conference Finals .
In Game 4 of the series , the Lightning trailed 3–0 at the end of the first period .
When Dwayne Roloson was pulled for Mike Smith , the Bruins failed to score again , and the Lightning tied the game in the second period by scoring three goals in 3:58 , going on to win the game 5–3 and tying the series at two games apiece .
The series went the full seven games , though the Lightning were eliminated by a single goal , as the game was lost ( 0–1 ) .
The Lightning finished the 2011–12 season with a 38–36–8 record .
With only 84 points , they fell short of reaching the playoffs , ending the season third in the Southeast Division and tenth in the Eastern Conference .
Individually , Steven Stamkos scored a franchise - record 60 goals .
He won the Maurice " Rocket " Richard Trophy for the second time in his career , the first time in which he was the unanimous victor .
Stamkos was also second in the NHL in points with 97 , and was a finalist for both the Hart Memorial Trophy and the Ted Lindsay Award .
As with the 1994–95 NHL lockout , the 2012–13 NHL lockout resulted in a 48-game season .
Nearing the end of a dismal 18–26–4 season for 40 points , in which the Lightning ended fourth in the Southeast and 14th in the East , GM Steve Yzerman looked to their highly - successful American Hockey League ( AHL ) affiliate , the Syracuse Crunch .
On March 25 , 2013 , head coach Guy Boucher was dismissed for following a 7–16–1 record .
The Lightning announced Jon Cooper would become the eighth head coach in franchise history .
Martin St. Louis won his second Art Ross Trophy with 60 points in the shortened season , as Stamkos finished runner - up 57 .
On June 27 , 2013 , the team announced that they would exercise one of their two " compliance buyouts " on captain Vincent Lecavalier , as permitted by the collective agreement .
This move would make Lecavalier an unrestricted free agent beginning July 5 , free to sign with any team except the Lightning .
The team stated the move was made not because of Lecavalier 's play on the ice , but simply because of how his contract affected the team 's salary cap , which would have been over $ 7 million per year until its expiration after the 2019–20 season .
STEVEN STAMKOS ERA ( 2013–PRESENT ) RETURN TO THE PLAYOFFS
Section::::Steven Stamkos era ( 2013–present ) .
Section::::Return to the playoffs .
After acquiring goaltender Ben Bishop from the Ottawa Senators in a trade the previous season , the Lightning started the 2013 season with an above average performance .
On November 11 , 2013 , going into the day tied for most goals during the regular season , Steven Stamkos suffered a broken right tibia after crashing into one of the goalposts during play against the Boston Bruins .
He would miss 45 games and was not cleared to play again until March 5 , 2014 .
In January , GM Steve Yzerman , who also served as the general manager for Canada 's team at the 2014 Winter Olympics , elected not to name Lightning captain Martin St. Louis to Canada 's roster , instead choosing the still - injured Stamkos .
After Stamkos was not medically cleared to play in Sochi in early February , Yzerman ultimately named St. Louis to Team Canada as an injury replacement .
In late February , it was reported St. Louis had requested a trade from Yzerman the month prior .
St. Louis , who had a no - move clause in his contract with Tampa Bay , reportedly consented to only being traded to the New York Rangers .
On March 5 , 2014 , St. Louis was sent to New York along with a conditional 2015 second - round pick in exchange for New York captain Ryan Callahan , a 2015 first - round draft pick , a conditional 2014 second - round pick and a 2015 conditional seventh - round pick .
The deal came subsequently after Stamkos had been cleared to return to the Lightning 's active roster .
St. Louis cited his decision based on his family and thanked Lightning fans for their support during his tenure with the franchise , but would not specify any further about the reasons leading to his request .
On March 6 , 2014 , Steven Stamkos was named Tampa Bay 's tenth captain in franchise history in his first game back after recovering from his tibia injury .
On April 7 , 2014 , the team announced it had signed GM Steve Yzerman to a four - year contract extension .
Finishing the season with 101 points , the Lightning placed second in the Atlantic Division , qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since 2011 .
However , Tampa Bay was eliminated in the first round of the Atlantic divisional semi - finals , losing to the Montreal Canadiens in a four - game sweep .
On June 25 , 2014 , the Lightning agreed to terms with Ryan Callahan , who was slated to become a free agent in the off - season , signing him to a six - year , $ 34.8 million contract extension .
The same day , the Lightning used its remaining compliance buyout on forward Ryan Malone after his on - ice performance had declined from injuries seasons prior in addition to his off - ice troubles that included a DUI arrest before the end of the season .
SECOND STANLEY CUP FINALS APPEARANCE Section::::Second Stanley Cup Finals appearance .
Finishing the 2014–15 season with 108 points , the Lightning placed second in the Atlantic Division and qualified for the playoffs for the second - straight season , scoring the most goals out of any team in the NHL .
Tampa Bay eliminated the Detroit Red Wings in seven games in the first round of the playoffs before facing Montreal in the second round .
The Lightning won the first three games of the series and had a chance to sweep the Canadiens , however Montreal responded with wins in Games 4 and 5 to extend the series to a sixth game .
Tampa Bay won the sixth game of the series to eliminate the Canadiens and advance to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 2011 , facing the New York Rangers .
In the Eastern Conference Finals , the Lightning and the Rangers split the first two games of the series in New York , with the Lightning winning Game 2 of the series thanks to a Tyler Johnson hat - trick .
The series then shifted to Tampa , where the Lightning had a come - from - behind overtime victory in Game 3 but lost Game 4 to even the series at two games apiece .
During Game 5 in New York , goaltender Ben Bishop recorded his second shutout of the playoffs in a 2–0 victory , but the Rangers responded in Game 6 by scoring seven goals to tie the series at three games apiece .
In Game 7 , Bishop recorded his third shutout of the playoffs in another 2–0 victory against the Rangers to lead the Lightning to their first appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals since 2004 .
The Lightning not only became the first team to defeat the Rangers in a Game 7 at Madison Square Garden , but they also became the first team to successfully defeat three Original Six teams in the first three rounds of the playoffs .
The Lightning would face the Chicago Blackhawks in the Stanley Cup Finals , making it the first time a finalist faced four Original Six teams in the playoffs since the four - round format was introduced in 1980 .
After losing Game 1 at home , the Lightning built a two games to one series lead , though the Blackhawks would win the following three games to win the Stanley Cup in six games at the United Center in Chicago .
This made Tampa Bay the first team to beat three of the Original Six teams in the playoffs since the Pittsburgh Penguins completed the feat in 1992 .
However , they became the first team to lose the Stanley Cup Finals despite beating three Original Six teams .
CONTINUING CHAMPIONSHIP CONTENTION Section::::Continuing championship contention .
Despite finishing with 46 wins and 97 points , the Lightning had a very slow start to the 2015–16 season .
The 2015–16 season was filled with controversy for the Lightning , starting off with the contractual questions regarding team captain Steven Stamkos and with the former third overall pick Jonathan Drouin publicly requesting a trade and being suspended from the organization .
The Lightning picked up their play at the beginning of the year 2016 and set the franchise record to nine consecutive wins on March 5 , 2016 , when Alex Killorn scored with 42.5 seconds remaining in overtime to propel the Lightning to a 4–3 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes at Amalie Arena .
On March 26 , 2016 , the Lightning announced cornerstone defenseman Anton Stralman had suffered a fractured leg in their game against the New York Islanders at home .
Tampa 's fortunes would get even worse when Stamkos shockingly was out of the lineup for the team 's game on April 2 against the New Jersey Devils in Tampa .
Lightning GM Steve Yzerman announced after the game that the captain would miss one - to - three months due to a blood clot in his arm .
Due to unfortunate circumstances , the team had no other option but to bring Drouin back to the team .
The Lightning ended up finishing second in the Atlantic Division and would once again face the third - seeded Detroit Red Wings in the first round of the playoffs .
The Lightning ended up defeating the Red Wings in five games after winning 1–0 at Amalie Arena .
Next up , the Islanders ( who had recently defeated the Panthers to win their first playoff series since the 1992–93 season ) would face the Lightning .
In Game 1 , the Islanders defeated the Bolts 5–3 .
The Lightning would eventually answer back by winning four consecutive games in the series to defeat the Isles in five games , in large part due to back - to - back road overtime victories with goals scored by Brian Boyle and Jason Garrison .
The Lightning were set to play against the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Eastern Conference Finals .
In Game 1 at Consol Energy Center , star goaltender Ben Bishop would be added to the list of devastating injuries for the team as he left on a stretcher and did not return for the remainder of the series .
Stralman would eventually return in Game 2 .
A back - and - forth series would eventually lead to a Game 7 showdown in Pittsburgh .
Lightning captain Steven Stamkos surprisingly took warmups and was in the Lightning lineup after a long absence from blood clot surgery .
However , it was not enough , as the Lightning would fall 2–1 against the Penguins , who went on to defeat the San Jose Sharks and win the Stanley Cup .
With the Lightning under the spotlight in the 2016 off - season , Drouin rescinded his trade request .
Steve Yzerman would then announce on June 29 the team re - signed Stamkos to an eight - year , cap - friendly deal .
He would then sign star defenseman Victor Hedman to an eight - year contract on July 1 , along with a seven - year deal for Alex Killorn and a three - year deal for former first round pick , goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy .
The Lightning narrowly missed the playoffs in the 2016–17 season .
Finishing with 94 points , they were beaten to the second wildcard by the Toronto Maple Leafs , with 95 points .
The 2016–17 season for the Lightning was a host of injuries , mainly their captain , Steven Stamkos .
Stamkos went down in the 17th game , against the Detroit Red Wings .
It was revealed he suffered from a torn left meniscus , which put him out for the rest of the season .
During the season , they traded goaltender Ben Bishop to the Los Angeles Kings , center Brian Boyle to the Toronto Maple Leafs , and forward Valtteri Filppula to the Philadelphia Flyers .
However , there were positive signs as winger Nikita Kucherov emerged with 40 goals and goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy stepped up after Bishop left .
The Lightning also showcased their young talent with rookie Brayden Point and promising AHL call - ups Yanni Gourde and Jake Dotchin .
The Lightning bounced back with this talent in the last third of the season , but it was not enough as they missed the playoffs by one point .
In the off - season , the Lightning made a deal with the Montreal Canadiens to send Jonathan Drouin to their franchise in exchange for defensive prospect Mikhail Sergachev and a second - round pick in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft .
They also signed defenseman Dan Girardi for two years and winger Chris Kunitz to a one - year deal .
In the 2017–18 season , Steven Stamkos returned from injury , scoring 20 points in the first 10 games and assisting on 9 of Nikita Kucherov 's 11 .
The Lightning finished the 2017–18 season with a record of 54–23–5 , finishing with 113 points .
The Lightning won their first Atlantic Division title and first division title since the 2003–04 season , as well as securing the top seed in the Eastern Conference for the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs .
Andrei Vasilevskiy was nominated for the Vezina Trophy .
Nikita Kucherov scored 100 points during the regular season , finishing third overall in the league .
Steve Yzerman was once again nominated for the NHL General Manager of the Year Award .
During the playoffs , the Lightning eliminated the New Jersey Devils in the first round and the Boston Bruins in the second round , both in five games .
However , they were defeated in the Eastern Conference Finals by the eventual - Stanley Cup champions , the Washington Capitals , in seven games .
On September 11 , 2018 , It was announced that Steve Yzerman would be resigning from his position as GM , and Julien BriseBois would be currently taking his place .

Taylor had served as the teams color commentator since the 1993–94 season , which was the team 's second year of existence .
Taylor cited that he desired to be home with his wife Jan more .
Taylor said , " The road was starting to get a little stale , " and " I 've been traveling since I was 15 , and that 's a long time . "
However , Taylor announced that he is not completely stepping away from the team broadcasts .
He will continue to serve as a sideline or studio analyst during the games on Fox Sports Sun for both home and away games .
Taylor may also see sometime between the benches during broadcasts the following season .
The Lightning have begun an immediate search for a replacement for Taylor for the coming season .

He won three Stanley Cups with the Canadiens ( 1977–1979 ) .
TEAM COLORS AND MASCOT Section::::Team colors and mascot .
Since 2010 , the Lightning colors have been blue , black and white .
Their logo has been a stylized lightning bolt .
This is the origin of one nickname for the team — the " Bolts . "
LOGO AND JERSEYS Section::::Logo and jerseys .
The original Lightning jerseys featured simple stripes on the sleeves and tail , and contrasting shoulders — black shoulders over a white jersey , and white shoulders over the black — with the alternate logo ( a lightning bolt over the outline of the state of Florida ) .
The underarm gussets included a feature referred to as " victory stripes"—a group of thin stripes , alternating in the team 's colors ( black - silver - blue on white , or white - blue - silver on black ) .
For the 1996–97 season , the Lightning added a third jersey , primarily blue with a sublimated wave and rain design on the front and back , lightning bolts down the sleeves , a silver - gray shoulder yoke , and black gussets .
The third jersey was retired after the 1998–99 season .
In their first two seasons , the Lightning used a stylized block font for player names , with gaps in the upper loops of letters such as A , B , D , and R.
The numbers were standard block numbers with drop shadows .
The fonts were vertical in 1992–93 , and italicized in 1993–94 .
The following season , the name font changed to a block font , vertically arched , while the number font changed to a painted style resembling the letters " Tampa Bay " in the logo .
This style was also used on the blue alternate in 1998–99 , replacing an " electrified " number font used from 1996–98 .
In 2001–02 , the old fonts were replaced with traditional block letters and numbers , which have been used ever since .
They also darkened their shades of blue that season from a royal blue to a speed ( Indy ) blue .
As with all NHL teams for the 2007–08 season , the Lightning debuted in new Reebok " Rbk Edge " jerseys .
Also , like several other NHL teams , the Lightning updated their team logo .
The Lightning unveiled their new logo on August 25 , 2007 .
The logo was similar to the inaugural one , but with a more modern look .
The new logo also kept the same theme as the previous one , but with the words " Tampa Bay " across the top now appearing with tall capital initials , and the word " Lightning " no longer appearing on the bottom of the logo .
The Edge jerseys use the same template adopted by the Ottawa Senators and Pittsburgh Penguins .
Unlike those teams , the Lightning 's elbow panels remain the base color of the jersey , and an additional blue panel is added near the cuff of the sleeve .
The Edge uniforms retain the underarm gusset " victory stripes " of their predecessors .
The Lightning then debuted a new " alternate " or " third " jersey in the 2008–09 season .
The jersey features a dominant " electric blue " color , with black and silver accents at the end of the sleeves .
The logo is removed , and in its place emblazoned across the front of the jersey descending to the lower left of the jersey is the word " BOLTS " ( utilizing a layout similar to that of the Ottawa Senators ' third jersey ) .
The numbers are featured on the back and sleeves only , using white lettering .
It was reported on January 23 , 2011 , that the Lightning had filed paperwork with the NHL to change their logo and colors , beginning with the 2011–12 season .
The new logo , as well as the new home and away jerseys , were unveiled by the team at a press conference at the St. Pete Times Forum on January 31 , 2011 .
The Lightning began to integrate the new logo onto center ice , and even distributed free T - shirts with the simplified logo on February 4 , 2011 , while still using the old Lightning logo and uniforms .
The current uniforms are made in a traditional hockey sweater design .
Initially , the colors that were to be used were simply blue and white , but by popular demand , black was later added as a trim color on the numbers .
The victory stripes were also eliminated .
Despite the introduction of the new uniforms , the previous third jersey was retained , with the new simplified logo replacing the old logo in the shoulders prior to the 2012–13 season .
For the 2014–15 season , the Lightning announced that a new black third sweater will replace the existing " BOLTS " sweaters .
The new sweaters were unveiled on September 27 , 2014 .
It retained the " BOLTS " wordmark , while adding white accents in a similar manner as the Los Angeles Kings ' sweaters .
The secondary roundel logo also replaced the primary logo on the sleeves , while the city name was enscripted on the collar .
The Lightning made some minor tweaks to their current uniform set following the NHL 's move to Adidas as its uniform provider in the 2017–18 season .
The most notable change is the removal of the " TAMPA BAY " wordmark on the white away sweaters .
