HALLUCINATION
A hallucination is a perception in the absence of external stimulus that has qualities of real perception .
Hallucinations are vivid , substantial , and are perceived to be located in external objective space .
They are distinguishable from several related phenomena , such as dreaming , which does not involve wakefulness ; pseudohallucination , which does not mimic real perception , and is accurately perceived as unreal ; illusion , which involves distorted or misinterpreted real perception ; and imagery , which does not mimic real perception and is under voluntary control .
Hallucinations also differ from " delusional perceptions " , in which a correctly sensed and interpreted stimulus ( i.e. , a real perception ) is given some additional ( and typically absurd ) significance .
Hallucinations can occur in any sensory modality â€” visual , auditory , olfactory , gustatory , tactile , proprioceptive , equilibrioceptive , nociceptive , thermoceptive and chronoceptive .
A mild form of hallucination is known as a disturbance , and can occur in most of the senses above .
These may be things like seeing movement in peripheral vision , or hearing faint noises and/or voices .
Auditory hallucinations are very common in schizophrenia .
They may be benevolent ( telling the subject good things about themselves ) or malicious , cursing the subject , etc .
Auditory hallucinations of the malicious type are frequently heard , for example people talking about the subject behind their back .
Like auditory hallucinations , the source of the visual counterpart can also be behind the subject 's back .
Their visual counterpart is the feeling of being looked or stared at , usually with malicious intent .
Frequently , auditory hallucinations and their visual counterpart are experienced by the subject together .
Hypnagogic hallucinations and hypnopompic hallucinations are considered normal phenomena .
Hypnagogic hallucinations can occur as one is falling asleep and
hypnopompic hallucinations occur when one is waking up .
Hallucinations can be associated with drug use ( particularly deliriants ) , sleep deprivation , psychosis , neurological disorders , and delirium tremens .
The word " hallucination " itself was introduced into the English language by the 17th - century physician Sir Thomas Browne in 1646 from the derivation of the Latin word alucinari meaning to wander in the mind .
For Browne , hallucination means a sort of vision that is " depraved and receive[s ]
its objects erroneously " .
CLASSIFICATION Section::::Classification .
Hallucinations may be manifested in a variety of forms .
Various forms of hallucinations affect different senses , sometimes occurring simultaneously , creating multiple sensory hallucinations for those experiencing them .
VISUAL Section::::Visual .
A visual hallucination is " the perception of an external visual stimulus where none exists " .
Alternatively , a visual illusion is a distortion of a real external stimulus .
Visual hallucinations are separated into simple and complex .
* Simple visual hallucinations ( SVH ) are also referred to as non - formed visual hallucinations and elementary visual hallucinations .
These terms refer to lights , colors , geometric shapes , and indiscrete objects .
These can be further subdivided into phosphenes which are SVH without structure , and photopsias which are SVH with geometric structures .
* Complex visual hallucinations ( CVH ) are also referred to as formed visual hallucinations .
CVHs are clear , lifelike images or scenes such as people , animals , objects , etc .
For example , one may report hallucinating a giraffe .
A simple visual hallucination is an amorphous figure that may have a similar shape or color to a giraffe ( looks like a giraffe ) , while a complex visual hallucination is a discrete , lifelike image that is , unmistakably , a giraffe .
AUDITORY Section::::Auditory .
Auditory hallucinations ( also known as paracusia ) are the perception of sound without outside stimulus .
Auditory hallucinations are the most common type of hallucination .
Auditory hallucinations can be divided into two categories : elementary and complex .
Elementary hallucinations are the perception of sounds such as hissing , whistling , an extended tone , and more .
In many cases , tinnitus is an elementary auditory hallucination .
However , some people who experience certain types of tinnitus , especially pulsatile tinnitus , are actually hearing the blood rushing through vessels near the ear .
Because the auditory stimulus is present in this situation , it does not qualify it as a hallucination .
Complex hallucinations are those of voices , music , or other sounds that may or may not be clear , may be familiar or completely unfamiliar , and friendly or aggressive , among other possibilities .
A hallucination of a single individual person of one or more talking voices is particularly associated with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia , and hold special significance in diagnosing these conditions .
If a group of people experience a complex auditory hallucination , no single individual can be named psychotic or schizophrenic .
Another typical disorder where auditory hallucinations are very common is dissociative identity disorder .
In schizophrenia voices are normally perceived coming from outside the person but in dissociative disorders they are perceived as originating from within the person , commenting in their head instead of behind their back .
Differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and dissociative disorders is challenging due to many overlapping symptoms , especially Schneiderian first rank symptoms such as hallucinations .
However , many people not suffering from diagnosable mental illness may sometimes hear voices as well .
One important example to consider when forming a differential diagnosis for a patient with paracusia is lateral temporal lobe epilepsy .
Despite the tendency to associate hearing voices , or otherwise hallucinating , and psychosis with schizophrenia or other psychiatric illnesses , it is crucial to take into consideration that , even if a person does exhibit psychotic features , he /
she does not necessarily suffer from a psychiatric disorder on its own .
Disorders such as Wilson 's disease , various endocrine diseases , numerous metabolic disturbances , multiple sclerosis , systemic lupus erythematosus , porphyria , sarcoidosis , and many others can present with psychosis .
Musical hallucinations are also relatively common in terms of complex auditory hallucinations and may be the result of a wide range of causes ranging from hearing - loss ( such as in musical ear syndrome , the auditory version of Charles Bonnet syndrome ) , lateral temporal lobe epilepsy , arteriovenous malformation , stroke , lesion , abscess , or tumor .
The Hearing Voices Movement is a support and advocacy group for people who hallucinate voices , but do not otherwise show signs of mental illness or impairment .
High caffeine consumption has been linked to an increase in the likelihood of one 's experiencing auditory hallucinations .
A study conducted by the La Trobe University School of Psychological Sciences revealed that as few as five cups of coffee a day ( approximately 500 mg of caffeine ) could trigger the phenomenon .
COMMAND Section::::Command .
Command hallucinations are hallucinations in the form of commands ; they can be auditory or inside of the person 's mind and/or consciousness .
The contents of the hallucinations can range from the innocuous to commands to cause harm to the self or others .
Command hallucinations are often associated with schizophrenia .
People experiencing command hallucinations may or may not comply with the hallucinated commands , depending on the circumstances .
Compliance is more common for non - violent commands .
Command hallucinations are sometimes used to defend a crime that has been committed , often homicides .
In essence , it is a voice that one hears and it tells the listener what to do .
Sometimes the commands are quite benign directives such as " Stand up " or " Shut the door .
" Whether it is a command for something simple or something that is a threat , it is still considered a " command hallucination . "
Some helpful questions that can assist one in figuring out if he / she may be suffering from this include : " What are the voices telling you to do ? " , " When did your voices first start telling you to do things ? " , " Do you recognize the person who is telling you to harm yourself ( or others ) ? " , " Do you think you can resist doing what the voices are telling you to do ? "
OLFACTORY Section::::Olfactory .
Phantosmia ( olfactory hallucinations ) , smelling an odor that is not actually there , and parosmia ( olfactory illusions ) , inhaling a real odor but perceiving it as different scent than remembered , are distortions to the sense of smell ( olfactory system ) that , in most cases , are not caused by anything serious and usually go away on their own in time .
It can result from a range of conditions such as nasal infections , nasal polyps , dental problems , migraines , head injuries , seizures , strokes , or brain tumors .
Environmental exposures are sometimes the cause as well , such as smoking , exposure to certain types of chemicals ( e.g. , insecticides or solvents ) , or radiation treatment for head or neck cancer .
It can also be a symptom of certain mental disorders such as depression , bipolar disorder , intoxication or withdrawal from drugs and alcohol , or psychotic disorders ( e.g. , schizophrenia ) .
The perceived odors are usually unpleasant and commonly described as smelling burned , foul spoiled , or rotten .
TACTILE Section::::Tactile .
Tactile hallucinations are the illusion of tactile sensory input , simulating various types of pressure to the skin or other organs .
One subtype of tactile hallucination , formication , is the sensation of insects crawling underneath the skin and is frequently associated with prolonged cocaine use .
However , formication may also be the result of normal hormonal changes such as menopause , or disorders such as peripheral neuropathy , high fevers , Lyme disease , skin cancer , and more .
GUSTATORY Section::::Gustatory .
This type of hallucination is the perception of taste without a stimulus .
These hallucinations , which are typically strange or unpleasant , are relatively common among individuals who have certain types of focal epilepsy , especially temporal lobe epilepsy .
The regions of the brain responsible for gustatory hallucination in this case are the insula and the superior bank of the sylvian fissure .
GENERAL SOMATIC
SENSATIONS Section::::General somatic sensations .
General somatic sensations of a hallucinatory nature are experienced when an individual feels that their body is being mutilated , i.e. twisted , torn , or disembowelled .
Other reported cases are invasion by animals in the person 's internal organs such as snakes in the stomach or frogs in the rectum .
The general feeling that one 's flesh is decomposing is also classified under this type of hallucination .
CAUSE Section::::Cause .
Hallucinations can be caused by a number of factors .
HYPNAGOGIC HALLUCINATION Section::::Hypnagogic hallucination .
These hallucinations occur just before falling asleep , and affect a high proportion of the population : in one survey 37 % of the respondents experienced them twice a week .
The hallucinations can last from seconds to minutes ; all the while , the subject usually remains aware of the true nature of the images .
These may be associated with narcolepsy .
Hypnagogic hallucinations are sometimes associated with brainstem abnormalities , but this is rare .
PEDUNCULAR HALLUCINOSIS Section::::Peduncular hallucinosis .
Peduncular means pertaining to the peduncle , which is a neural tract running to and from the pons on the brain stem .
These hallucinations usually occur in the evenings , but not during drowsiness , as in the case of hypnagogic hallucination .
The subject is usually fully conscious and then can interact with the hallucinatory characters for extended periods of time .
As in the case of hypnagogic hallucinations , insight into the nature of the images remains intact .
The false images can occur in any part of the visual field , and are rarely polymodal .
DELIRIUM TREMENS Section::::Delirium tremens .
One of the more enigmatic forms of visual hallucination is the highly variable , possibly polymodal delirium tremens .
Individuals suffering from delirium tremens may be agitated and confused , especially in the later stages of this disease .
Insight is gradually reduced with the progression of this disorder .
Sleep is disturbed and occurs for a shorter period of time , with rapid eye movement sleep .
PARKINSON 'S DISEASE AND LEWY BODY
DEMENTIA
Section::::Parkinson 's disease and Lewy body dementia .
Parkinson 's disease is linked with Lewy body dementia for their similar hallucinatory symptoms .
The symptoms strike during the evening in any part of the visual field , and are rarely polymodal .
The segue into hallucination may begin with illusions where sensory perception is greatly distorted , but no novel sensory information is present .
These typically last for several minutes , during which time the subject may be either conscious and normal or drowsy / inaccessible .
Insight into these hallucinations is usually preserved and REM sleep is usually reduced .
Parkinson 's disease is usually associated with a degraded substantia nigra pars compacta , but recent evidence suggests that PD affects a number of sites in the brain .
Some places of noted degradation include the median raphe nuclei , the noradrenergic parts of the locus coeruleus , and the cholinergic neurons in the parabrachial area and pedunculopontine nuclei of the tegmentum .
MIGRAINE COMA Section::::Migraine coma .
This type of hallucination is usually experienced during the recovery from a comatose state .
The migraine coma can last for up to two days , and a state of depression is sometimes comorbid .
The hallucinations occur during states of full consciousness , and insight into the hallucinatory nature of the images is preserved .
It has been noted that ataxic lesions accompany the migraine coma .
CHARLES BONNET SYNDROME Section::::Charles Bonnet syndrome .
Charles Bonnet syndrome is the name given to visual hallucinations experienced by a partially or severely sight impaired person .
The hallucinations can occur at any time and can distress people of any age , as they may not initially be aware that they are hallucinating , they may fear initially for their own mental health which may delay them sharing with carers what is happening until they start to understand it themselves .
The hallucinations can frighten and disconcert as to what is real and what is not and carers need to learn how to support sufferers .
The hallucinations can sometimes be dispersed by eye movements , or perhaps just reasoned logic such as , " I can see fire but there is no smoke and there is no heat from it " or perhaps " We have an infestation of rats but they have pink ribbons with a bell tied on their necks . "
Over elapsed months and years the manifestation of the hallucinations may change , becoming more or less frequent with changes in ability to see .
The length of time that the sight impaired person can suffer from these hallucinations varies according to the underlying speed of eye deterioration .
A differential diagnosis are ophthalmopathic hallucinations .
FOCAL EPILEPSY Section::::Focal epilepsy .
Visual hallucinations due to focal seizures differ depending on the region of the brain where the seizure occurs .
For example , visual hallucinations during occipital lobe seizures are typically visions of brightly colored , geometric shapes that may move across the visual field , multiply , or form concentric rings and generally persist from a few seconds to a few minutes .
They are usually unilateral and localized to one part of the visual field on the contralateral side of the seizure focus , typically the temporal field .
However , unilateral visions moving horizontally across the visual field begin on the contralateral side and move toward the ipsilateral side .
Temporal lobe seizures , on the other hand , can produce complex visual hallucinations of people , scenes , animals , and more as well as distortions of visual perception .
Complex hallucinations may appear to be real or unreal , may or may not be distorted with respect to size , and may seem disturbing or affable , among other variables .
One rare but notable type of hallucination is heautoscopy , a hallucination of a mirror image of one 's self .
These " other selves " may be perfectly still or performing complex tasks , may be an image of a younger self or the present self , and tend to be only briefly present .
Complex hallucinations are a relatively uncommon finding in temporal lobe epilepsy patients .
Rarely , they may occur during occipital focal seizures or in parietal lobe seizures .
Distortions in visual perception during a temporal lobe seizure may include size distortion ( micropsia or macropsia ) , distorted perception of movement ( where moving objects may appear to be moving very slowly or to be perfectly still ) , a sense that surfaces such as ceilings and even entire horizons are moving farther away in a fashion similar to the dolly zoom effect , and other illusions .
Even when consciousness is impaired , insight into the hallucination or illusion is typically preserved .
DRUG - INDUCED HALLUCINATION Section::::Drug - induced hallucination .
Drug - induced hallucinations are caused hallucinogens , dissociatives , deliriants including many drugs with anticholinergic actions and certain stimulants , which are known to cause visual and auditory hallucinations .
Some psychedelics such as lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) and psilocybin can cause hallucinations that range from a spectrum of mild to severe .
Hallucinations , pseudohallucinations , or intensification of pareidolia , particularly auditory , are known side effects of opioids to different degrees â€” it may be associated with the absolute degree of agonism and/or antagonism of especially the kappa opioid receptor , sigma receptors , delta opioid receptor and the NMDA receptors or the overall receptor activation profile as synthetic opioids like those of the pentazocine , levorphanol , fentanyl , pethidine , methadone and some other families are more associated with this side effect than natural opioids like morphine and codeine and semi - synthetics like hydromorphone , amongst which there also appears to be a stronger correlation with the relative analgesic strength .
Three opioids , Cyclazocine ( a benzormorphan opioid / pentazocine relative ) and two levorphanol - related morphinan opioids , Cyclorphan and Dextorphan are classified as hallucinogens , and Dextromethorphan as a dissociative .
These drugs also can induce sleep ( relating to hypnagogic hallucinations ) and especially the pethidines have atropine - like anticholinergic activity , which was possibly also a limiting factor in the use , the psychotomometic side effects of potentiating morphine , oxycodone , and other opioids with scopolamine ( respectively in the Twilight Sleep technique and the combination drug Skophedal , which was eukodal ( oxycodone ) , scopolamine and ephedrine , called the " wonder drug of the 1930s " after its invention in Germany in 1928 , but only rarely specially compounded today )
( q.q.v . ) .
SENSORY DEPRIVATION HALLUCINATION Section::::Sensory deprivation hallucination .
Hallucinations can be caused by sense deprivation when it occurs for prolonged periods of time , and almost always occur in the modality being deprived ( visual for blindfolded / darkness , auditory for muffled conditions , etc . )
EXPERIMENTALLY - INDUCED
HALLUCINATIONS Section::::Experimentally - induced hallucinations .
Anomalous experiences , such as so - called benign hallucinations , may occur in a person in a state of good mental and physical health , even in the apparent absence of a transient trigger factor such as fatigue , intoxication or sensory deprivation .
The evidence for this statement has been accumulating for more than a century .
Studies of benign hallucinatory experiences go back to 1886 and the early work of the Society for Psychical Research , which suggested approximately 10 % of the population had experienced at least one hallucinatory episode in the course of their life .
More recent studies have validated these findings ; the precise incidence found varies with the nature of the episode and the criteria of " hallucination " adopted , but the basic finding is now well - supported . NON - CELIAC GLUTEN SENSITIVITY Section::::Non - celiac gluten sensitivity .
There is tentative evidence of a relationship with non - celiac gluten sensitivity , the so - called " gluten psychosis " .
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY NEUROANATOMY Section::::Pathophysiology .
Section::::Neuroanatomy .
Hallucinations are associated with structural and functional abnormalities in primary and secondary sensory cortices .
Reduced grey matter in regions of the superior temporal gyrus / middle temporal gyrus , including broca 's area , is associated with auditory hallucinations as a trait , while acute hallucinations are associated with increased activity in the same regions along with the hippocampus , parahippocampus , and the right hemispheric homologue of broca 's area in the inferior frontal gyrus .
Grey and white matter abnormalities in visual regions are associated with visual hallucinations in diseases such as alzheimer 's disease , further supporting the notion of dysfunction in sensory regions underlying hallucinations .
One proposed model of hallucinations posits that overactivity in sensory regions , which is normally attributed to internal sources via feedforward networks to the inferior frontal gyrus , is interpreted as originating externally due to abnormal connectivity or functionality of the feedforward network .
This is supported by cognitive studies those with hallucinations , who demonstrate abnormal attribution of self generated stimuli .
Disruptions in thalamocortical circuitry may underlie the observed top down and bottom up dysfunction .
Thalamocortical circuits , composed of projections between thalamic and cortical neurons and adjacent interneurons , underlie certain electrophysical characteristics(gamma oscillations ) that are underlie sensory processing .
Cortical inputs to thalamic neurons enable attentional modulation of sensory neurons .
Dysfunction in sensory afferents , and abnormal cortical input may result in pre - existing expectations modulating sensory experience , potentially resulting in the generation of hallucinations .
Hallucinations are associated with less accurate sensory processing , and more intense stimuli with less interference are necessary for accurate processing and the appearance of gamma oscillations(called
" gamma synchrony " ) .
Hallucinations are also associated with the absence of reduction in P50 amplitude in response to the presentation of a second stimuli after an initial stimulus ; this is thought to represent failure to gate sensory stimuli , and can be exacerbated by dopamine release agents .
Abnormal assignment of salience to stimuli may be one mechanism of hallucinations .
Dysfunctional dopamine signaling may lead to abnormal top down regulation of sensory processing , allowing expectations to distort sensory input .
TREATMENTS
Section::::Treatments .
There are few treatments for many types of hallucinations .
However , for those hallucinations caused by mental disease , a psychologist or psychiatrist should be alerted , and treatment will be based on the observations of those doctors .
Antipsychotic and atypical antipsychotic medication may also be utilized to treat the illness if the symptoms are severe and cause significant distress .
For other causes of hallucinations there is no factual evidence to support any one treatment is scientifically tested and proven .
However , abstaining from hallucinogenic drugs , stimulant drugs , managing stress levels , living healthily , and getting plenty of sleep can help reduce the prevalence of hallucinations .
In all cases of hallucinations , medical attention should be sought out and informed of one 's specific symptoms .
EPIDEMIOLOGY Section::::Epidemiology .
One study from as early as 1895 reported a much higher figure , with almost 39 % of people reporting hallucinatory experiences , 27 % of which daytime hallucinations , mostly outside the context of illness or drug use .
From this survey , olfactory ( smell ) and gustatory ( taste ) hallucinations seem the most common in the general population .
