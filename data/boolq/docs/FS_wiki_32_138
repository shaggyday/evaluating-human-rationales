HOLLY Ilex , or holly , is a genus of about 480 species of flowering plants in the family Aquifoliaceae , and the only living genus in that family .
The species are evergreen or deciduous trees , shrubs , and climbers from tropics to temperate zones worldwide .
DESCRIPTION Section::::Description .
The genus Ilex includes about 480 species , divided into three subgenera : * Ilex subg .
Byronia , with the type species Ilex polypyrena
* Ilex subg .
Prinos , with 12 species * Ilex subg .
Ilex , with the rest of the species
The genus is widespread throughout the temperate and subtropical regions of the world .
It includes species of trees , shrubs , and climbers , with evergreen or deciduous foliage and inconspicuous flowers .
Its range was more extended in the Tertiary period and many species are adapted to laurel forest habitat .
It occurs from sea level to more than with high mountain species .
It is a genus of small , evergreen trees with smooth , glabrous , or pubescent branchlets .
The plants are generally slow - growing with some species growing to tall .
The type species is the European holly Ilex aquifolium described by Linnaeus .
Plants in this genus have simple , alternate glossy leaves , frequently with a spiny leaf margin .
The inconspicuous flower is greenish white , with four petals .
They are generally dioecious , with male and female flowers on different plants .
The small fruits of Ilex , although often referred to as berries , are technically drupes .
They range in color from red to brown to black , and rarely green or yellow .
The " bones " contain up to ten seeds each .
Some species produce fruits parthenogenetically , such as the cultivar ' Nellie R. Stevens ' .
The fruits ripen in winter and thus provide winter colour contrast between the bright red of the fruits and the glossy green evergreen leaves .
Hence the cut branches , especially of I. aquifolium , are widely used in Christmas decoration .
The fruits are generally slightly toxic to humans , and can cause vomiting and diarrhea when ingested .
However , they are an important food source for birds and other animals , which help disperse the seeds .
Unfortunately this can have negative impacts as well .
Along the west coast of North America , from California to British Columbia , English Holly ( Ilex aquifolium ) , which is grown commercially , is quickly spreading into native forest habitat , where it thrives in shade and crowds out native species .
It has been placed on the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board 's monitor list , and is a Class C invasive plant in Portland .
ETYMOLOGY Section::::Etymology .
Ilex in Latin means the holm - oak or evergreen oak ( Quercus ilex ) .
Despite the Linnaean classification of Ilex as holly , as late as the 19th century in Britain , the term Ilex was still being applied to the oak as well as the holly – possibly due to the superficial similarity of the leaves .
The name " holly " in common speech refers to Ilex aquifolium , specifically stems with berries used in Christmas decoration .
By extension , " holly " is also applied to the whole genus .
The origin of the word " holly " is considered a reduced form of Old English , Middle English Holin , later Hollen .
The French word for holly , ' , derives from the Old Low Franconian * hulis ( Middle Dutch huls ) .
Both are related to Old High German ' , huls , as are Low German / Low Franconian terms like ' or ' .
These Germanic words appear to be related to words for holly in Celtic languages , such as Welsh ' , Breton ' and Irish .
Several Romance languages use the Latin word acrifolium , literally " sharp leaf " ( turned into aquifolium in modern time ) , so Italian ' , Occitan ' , etc . HISTORY Section::::History .
The phylogeography of this group provides examples of various speciation mechanisms at work .
In this scenario ancestors of this group became isolated from the remaining Ilex when the Earth mass broke away into Gondwana and Laurasia about 82million years ago , resulting in a physical separation of the groups and beginning a process of change to adapt to new conditions .
This mechanism is called allopatric speciation .
Over time , survivor species of the holly genus adapted to different ecological niches .
This led to reproductive isolation , an example of ecological speciation .
In the Pliocene , around five million years ago , mountain formation diversified the landscape and provided new opportunities for speciation within the genus .
The fossil record indicates that the Ilex lineage was already widespread prior to the end of the Cretaceous period .
Based on the molecular clock , the common ancestor of most of the extant species probably appeared during the Eocene , about 50million years ago , suggesting that older representatives of the genus belong to now extinct branches .
The laurel forest covered great areas of the Earth during the Paleogene , when the genus was more prosperous .
This type of forest extended during the Neogene , more than 20million years ago .
Most of the last remaining temperate broadleaf evergreen forests are believed to have disappeared about 10,000 years ago at the end of the Pleistocene .
Many of the then - existing species with the strictest ecological requirements became extinct because they could not cross the barriers imposed by the geography , but others found refuge as a species relict in coastal enclaves , archipelagos , and coastal mountains sufficiently far from areas of extreme cold and aridity and protected by the oceanic influence .
RANGE Section::::Range .
The genus is distributed throughout the world 's different climates .
Most species make their home in the tropics and subtropics , with a worldwide distribution in temperate zones .
The greatest diversity of species is found in the Americas and in Southeast Asia .
Ilex mucronata , formerly the type species of Nemopanthus , is native to eastern North America .
Nemopanthus was treated as a separate genus with eight species .
of the family Aquifoliaceae , now transferred to Ilex on molecular data ; it is closely related to Ilex amelanchier .
In Europe the genus is represented by a single species , the classically named holly Ilex aquifolium , and in continental Africa by this species and ( Ilex mitis ) .
Ilex canariensis , from Macaronesia , and Ilex aquifolium arose from a common ancestor in the laurel forests of the Mediterranean .
Australia , isolated at an early period , has ( Ilex arnhemensis ) .
Of 204 species growing in China , 149 species are endemic .
A species which stands out for its economic importance in Spanish - speaking countries and in Brazil is Ilex paraguariensis or Yerba mate .
Having evolved numerous species that are endemic to islands and small mountain ranges , and being highly useful plants , many hollies are now becoming rare .
ECOLOGY Section::::Ecology .
Often the tropical species are especially threatened by habitat destruction and overexploitation .
At least two species of Ilex have become extinct recently , and many others are barely surviving .
They are extremely important food for numerous species of birds , and also are eaten by other wild animals .
In the autumn and early winter the fruits are hard and apparently unpalatable .
After being frozen or frosted several times , the fruits soften , and become milder in taste .
During winter storms , birds often take refuge in hollies , which provide shelter , protection from predators ( by the spiny leaves ) , and food .
The flowers are sometimes eaten by the larva of the double - striped pug moth ( Gymnoscelis rufifasciata ) .
Other Lepidoptera whose larvae feed on holly include Bucculatrix ilecella , which feeds exclusively on hollies , and the engrailed ( Ectropis crepuscularia ) .
TOXICITY Section::::Toxicity .
Holly can contain caffeic acid , caffeoyl derivatives , caffeoylshikimic acid , chlorogenic acid , feruloylquinic acid , quercetin , quinic acid , kaempferol , tannins , rutin , caffeine , and theobromine .
Holly berries can cause vomiting and diarrhea .
They are especially dangerous in cases involving accidental consumption by children attracted to the bright red berries .
Ingestion of over 20 berries may be fatal to children .
Holly leaves , if eaten , might cause diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , and stomach and intestinal problems .
Holly plants might be toxic to pets and livestock .
USAGE Section::::Usage .
Leaves of some holly species are used by some cultures to make daily tea .
These species are Yerba mate ( I. paraguariensis ) , Ilex guayusa , Kuding ( Ilex kaushue ) , Yaupon ( I. vomitoria ) and others .
Leaves of other species , such as gallberry ( I. glabra ) are bitter and emetic .
In general little is known about inter - species variation in constituents or toxicity of hollies .
ORNAMENTAL USE Section::::Ornamental use .
Many of the holly species are widely used as ornamental plants in temperate / European gardens and parks , notably : * I. aquifolium ( common European holly )
* I. crenata ( box - leaved holly )
* I. verticillata ( winterberry )
Moreover , many hundreds of hybrids and cultivars have been developed for garden use , among them the very popular " Highclere holly " , Ilex × altaclerensis ( I. aquifolium × I. perado ) and the " blue holly " , Ilex × meserveae ( I. aquifolium × I. rugosa ) .
The cultivar I. × meserveae Blue Prince = '
Conablu ' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society 's Award of Garden Merit .
Hollies are often used for hedges ; the spiny leaves make them difficult to penetrate , and they take well to pruning and shaping .
CULTURE
Section::::Culture .
Holly – more specifically the European holly , Ilex aquifolium – is commonly referenced at Christmas time , and is often referred to by the name Christ 's thorn .
In many Western Christian cultures , holly is a traditional Christmas decoration , used especially in wreaths and illustrations , for instance on Christmas cards .
Since medieval times the plant has carried a Christian symbolism , as expressed in the well - known Christian Christmas carol " The Holly and the Ivy " , in which the holly represents Jesus and the ivy represents the Virgin Mary .
Angie Mostellar discusses the Christian use of holly at Christmas , stating that : In heraldry , holly is used to symbolize truth .
The Norwegian municipality of Stord has a yellow twig of holly in its Coat - of - arms .
The Druids held that " leaves of holly offered protection against evil spirits " and thus " wore holly in their hair " .
In the Harry Potter novels , holly is used as the wood in Harry 's wand .
In some Traditions of Wicca , the Holly King is one of the faces of the Sun God .
He is born at Midsummer and rules from Mabon to Ostara .
