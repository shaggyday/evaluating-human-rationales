GUN LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES
BY
STATE Gun laws in the United States regulate the sale , possession , and use of firearms and ammunition .
State laws ( and the laws of the District of Columbia and of the U.S. territories ) vary considerably , and are independent of existing federal firearms laws , although they are sometimes broader or more limited in scope than the federal laws .
State level laws vary significantly in their form , content , and level of restriction .
Forty - four states have a provision in their state constitutions similar to the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , which protects the right to keep and bear arms .
The exceptions are California , Iowa , Maryland , Minnesota , New Jersey , and New York .
In New York , however , the statutory civil rights laws contain a provision virtually identical to the Second Amendment .
Additionally , the U.S. Supreme Court held in McDonald v. Chicago that the protections of the Second Amendment to keep and bear arms for self - defense in one 's home apply against state governments and their political subdivisions .
Firearm owners are subject to the firearm laws of the state they are in , and not exclusively their state of residence .
Reciprocity between states exists in certain situations , such as with regard to concealed carry permits .
These are recognized on a state - by - state basis .
For example , Idaho recognizes an Oregon permit , but Oregon does not recognize an Idaho permit .
Florida issues a license to carry both concealed weapons and firearms , but others license only the concealed carry of firearms .
Some states do not recognize out - of - state permits to carry a firearm at all , so it is important to understand the laws of each state when traveling with a handgun .
In many cases , state firearms laws can be considerably less restrictive than federal firearms laws .
This does not confer any de jure immunity against prosecution for violations of the federal laws .
However , state and local police departments are not legally obligated to enforce federal gun law as per the U.S. Supreme Court 's ruling in Printz v. United States .
