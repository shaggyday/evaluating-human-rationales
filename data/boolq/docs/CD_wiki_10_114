POSTAL ORDER
A postal order is a financial instrument usually intended for sending money through the mail .
It is purchased at a post office and is payable at another post office to the named recipient .
A small fee for the service , known as poundage , is paid by the purchaser .
In the United States , this is known as a postal money order .
Postal orders are not legal tender , but a type of promissory note , similar to a cheque .
HISTORY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM Section::::History in the United Kingdom .
The postal order is a direct descendent of the money order , which had been established by a private company in 1792 .
During World War I and World War II , British postal orders were temporarily declared legal tender to save paper and labour .
Postal orders can be bought and redeemed at post offices in the UK , although a crossed postal order must be paid into a bank account .
Until April 2006 they came in fixed denominations but due to increased popularity they were redesigned to make them more flexible and secure .
They now have the payee and value added at the time of purchase , making them more like a cheque .
The fee for using this form of payment falls into one of three bands - details are available on the Post Office website .
The maximum value of postal order available is £ 250.00 with the fee capped at £ 12.50 .
Despite competition from cheques and electronic funds transfer , postal orders continue to appeal to customers , especially as a form of payment for shopping on the Internet , as they are drawn on the Post Office 's accounts so a vendor can be certain that they will not bounce .
They also enable those without a bank account , including minors , to make small financial transactions without the need for cash .
Postal workers in the United Kingdom use voided or cancelled orders in their training .
INTERNATIONAL USE OF THE BRITISH POSTAL ORDER
Section::::International use of the British postal order .

THE UNITED STATES Section::::The United States .
United States Postal Money Orders appear facially as a draft against an account held by the United States Postal Service , and the United States Postal Service requires a purchaser to know , in advance , where presentment of the instrument will occur .

In the United States , international money orders are pink and domestic money orders are green .

COLLECTING
Section::::Collecting .
Postal orders are gaining in popularity as collectibles , especially among numismatists who collect banknotes .
