AUSTRALIA
AT
THE FIFA WORLD CUP
The Australia national soccer team , nicknamed the Socceroos , has represented Australia at the FIFA World Cup finals on five occasions : in 1974 , 2006 , 2010 , 2014 and 2018 .
In Australia 's first appearance , representing OFC , a team made up entirely of amateurs secured a scoreless draw against Chile , though eventually departed from the 1974 tournament without a goal to show from their inaugural appearance .
Australia made up for lost time at Germany 2006 and qualified for the Round of 16 before narrowly falling to eventual champions Italy .
The German theme continued at South Africa 2010 although this time Australia , now representing the AFC , suffered a 4 - 0 loss against the European giants in a scoreline which ultimately scuppered their progress .
A ten - man 1–1 draw against Ghana and a 2–1 win against Serbia saw Australia eliminated on goal difference , three goals off the Africans .
Australia were to lose all three games in a tough group at Brazil 2014 .
