IMMEDIATE FAMILY
The immediate family is a defined group of relations , used in rules or laws to determine which members of a person 's family are affected by those rules .
It normally includes a person 's parents , spouses , siblings , children , or an individual related by blood whose close association is an equivalent of a family relationship .
It can contain others connected by birth , adoption , marriage , civil partnership , or cohabitation , such as grandparents , great - grandparents , grandchildren , great - grandchildren , aunts , uncles , siblings - in - law , half - siblings , cousins , adopted children and step - parents / step - children , and cohabiting partners .
The term close relatives is used similarly .
The concept of " immediate family " acknowledges that a person has or may feel particular responsibilities towards family members , which may make it difficult to act fairly towards non - family ( hence the refusal of many companies to employ immediate family members of current employees ) , or which call for special allowance to recognise this responsibility ( such as compensation on death , or permission to leave work to attend a funeral ) .
It is used by travel insurance policies to determine a set of people on the basis of whose health someone might need to cancel a journey or return early .
The concept is used by some countries ' inheritance laws .
