AZEOTROPE
An azeotrope ( UK , US ) or a constant boiling point mixture is a mixture of two or more liquids whose proportions can not be altered or changed by simple distillation .
This happens because when an azeotrope is boiled , the vapour has the same proportions of constituents as the unboiled mixture .
Because their composition is unchanged by distillation , azeotropes are also called ( especially in older texts ) constant boiling point mixtures .
Many azeotropic mixtures of pairs of compounds are known , and many azeotropes of three or more compounds are also known .
In such a case it is not possible to separate the components by fractional distillation .
There are two types of azeotropes : minimum boiling azeotrope and maximum boiling azeotrope .
A solution that shows greater positive deviation from Raoult 's law forms a minimum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition .
For example , an ethanol - water mixture ( obtained by fermentation of sugars ) on fractional distillation yields a solution containing approximately 95 % by volume of ethanol .
Once this composition has been achieved , the liquid and vapour have the same composition , and no further separation occurs .
A solution that shows large negative deviation from Raoult 's law forms a maximum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition .
Nitric acid and water is an example of this class of azeotrope .
This azeotrope has an approximate composition of 68 % nitric acid and 32 % water by mass , with a boiling point of .
ETYMOLOGY Section::::Etymology .
The term azeotrope is derived from the Greek words ζέειν ( boil ) and τρόπος ( turning ) with the prefix α- ( no ) to give the overall meaning , " no change on boiling " .
The term was coined in 1911 by English chemist John Wade ( 1864–1912 ) and Richard William Merriman .
TYPES
POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE
AZEOTROPES Section::::Types .
Section::::Positive and negative azeotropes .
Each azeotrope has a characteristic boiling point .
The boiling point of an azeotrope is either less than the boiling point temperatures of any of its constituents ( a positive azeotrope ) , or greater than the boiling point of any of its constituents ( a negative azeotrope ) .
A well - known example of a positive azeotrope is 95.63 % ethanol and 4.37 % water ( by mass ) boils at 78.2 ° C .
Ethanol boils at 78.4 ° C , water boils at 100 ° C , but the azeotrope boils at 78.2 ° C , which is lower than either of its constituents .
Indeed , 78.2 ° C is the minimum temperature at which any ethanol / water solution can boil at atmospheric pressure .
In general , a positive azeotrope boils at a lower temperature than any other ratio of its constituents .
Positive azeotropes are also called minimum boiling mixtures or pressure maximum azeotropes .
In general , a negative azeotrope boils at a higher temperature than any other ratio of its constituents .
Negative azeotropes are also called maximum boiling mixtures or pressure minimum azeotropes .
An example of a negative azeotrope is hydrochloric acid at a concentration of 20.2 % and 79.8 % water ( by mass ) .
Hydrogen chloride boils at −84 ° C and water at 100 ° C , but the azeotrope boils at 110 ° C , which is higher than either of its constituents .
The maximum temperature at which any hydrochloric acid solution can boil is 110 ° C .
Other examples : * sulfuric acid ( 98.3 % ) / water , boils at 338 ° C * nitric acid ( 68 % ) / water , boils at 120.2 ° C at 1 atm * perchloric acid ( 71.6 % ) / water , boils at 203 ° C * hydrofluoric acid ( 35.6 % ) / water , boils at 111.35 ° C HOMOGENEOUS AND HETEROGENEOUS AZEOTROPES Section::::Homogeneous and heterogeneous azeotropes .
If the constituents of a mixture are completely miscible in all proportions with each other , the type of azeotrope is called a homogeneous azeotrope .
For example , any amount of ethanol can be mixed with any amount of water to form a homogeneous solution .
If the constituents are not completely miscible , an azeotrope can be found inside the miscibility gap .
This type of azeotrope is called heterogeneous azeotrope or heteroazeotrope .
A heteroazeotropic distillation will have two liquid phases .
For example , acetone / methanol / chloroform form an intermediate boiling ( saddle ) azeotrope .
For example , if equal volumes of chloroform ( water solubility 0.8 g/100
ml at 20 ° C ) and water are shaken together and then left to stand , the liquid will separate into two layers .
Analysis of the layers shows that the top layer is mostly water with a small amount of chloroform dissolved in it , and the bottom layer is mostly chloroform with a small amount of water dissolved in it .
If the two layers are heated together , the system of layers will boil at 53.3 ° C , which is lower than either the boiling point of chloroform ( 61.2 ° C ) or the boiling point of water ( 100 ° C ) .
The vapor will consist of 97.0 % chloroform and 3.0 % water regardless of how much of each liquid layer is present provided both layers are indeed present .
If the vapor is re - condensed , the layers will reform in the condensate , and will do so in a fixed ratio , which in this case is 4.4 % of the volume in the top layer and 95.6 % in the bottom layer .
Such a system of solvents is known as a heteroazeotrope .
Heteroazeotropes are always minimum boiling mixtures .
The diagram illustrates how the various phases of a heteroazeotrope are related .
NUMBER OF CONSTITUENTS Section::::Number of constituents .
Azeotropes consisting of two constituents are called binary azeotropes such as diethyl ether ( 33 % ) / halothane ( 66 % ) a mixture once commonly used in anaesthesia .
For example , benzene and hexafluorobenzene form a double binary azeotrope .
Azeotropes consisting of three constituents are called ternary azeotropes , e.g. acetone / methanol / chloroform .
Azeotropes of more than three constituents are also known .
ZEOTROPY Section::::Zeotropy .
Combinations of solvents that do not form an azeotrope when mixed in any proportion are said to be zeotropic .
Azeotropes are useful in separating zeotropic mixtures .
An example is acetic acid and water , which do not form an azeotrope .
Despite this it is very difficult to separate pure acetic acid ( boiling point : 118.1 ° C )
from a solution of acetic acid and water by distillation alone .
As progressive distillations produce solutions with less and less water , each further distillation becomes less effective at removing the remaining water .
Distilling the solution to dry acetic acid is therefore economically impractical .
But ethyl acetate forms an azeotrope with water that boils at 70.4 ° C .
By adding ethyl acetate as an entrainer , it is possible to distill away the azeotrope and leave nearly pure acetic acid as the residue .
MECHANISM CONDITION OF EXISTENCE Section::::Mechanism .
Section::::Condition of existence .
The condition relates activity coefficients in liquid phase to total pressure and the vapour pressures of pure components .
Azeotropes can form only when a mixture deviates from Raoult 's law , the equality of compositions in liquid phase and vapor phases , in vapour - liquid equilibrium and Dalton 's law the equality of pressures for total pressure being equal to the sum of the partial pressures in real mixtures .
In other words : Raoult 's law predicts the vapor pressures of ideal mixtures as a function of composition ratio .
More simply : per Raoult 's law molecules of the constituents stick to each other to the same degree as they do to themselves .
For example , if the constituents are X and Y , then X sticks to Y with roughly equal energy as X does with X and Y does with Y. A so - called positive deviation from Raoult 's law results when the constituents have a disaffinity for each other – that is X sticks to X and Y to Y better than X sticks to Y. Because this results in the mixture having less total affinity of the molecules than the pure constituents , they more readily escape from the stuck - together phase , which is to say the liquid phase , and into the vapor phase .
When X sticks to Y more aggressively than X does to X and Y does to Y , the result is a negative deviation from Raoult 's law .
In this case because the molecules in the mixture are sticking together more than in the pure constituents , they are more reluctant to escape the stuck - together liquid phase .
When the deviation is great enough to cause a maximum or minimum in the vapor pressure versus composition function , it is a mathematical consequence that at that point , the vapor will have the same composition as the liquid , resulting in an azeotrope .
The adjacent diagram illustrates total vapor pressure of three hypothetical mixtures of constituents , X , and Y.
The temperature throughout the plot is assumed to be constant .
The center trace is a straight line , which is what Raoult 's law predicts for an ideal mixture .
In general solely mixtures of chemically similar solvents , such as n - hexane with n - heptane , form nearly ideal mixtures that come close to obeying Raoult 's law .
The top trace illustrates a nonideal mixture that has a positive deviation from Raoult 's law , where the total combined vapor pressure of constituents , X and Y , is greater than what is predicted by Raoult 's law .
The top trace deviates sufficiently that there is a point on the curve where its tangent is horizontal .
Whenever a mixture has a positive deviation and has a point at which the tangent is horizontal , the composition at that point is a positive azeotrope .
At that point the total vapor pressure is at a maximum .
Likewise the bottom trace illustrates a nonideal mixture that has a negative deviation from Raoult 's law , and at the composition where tangent to the trace is horizontal there is a negative azeotrope .
This is also the point where total vapor pressure is minimum .
MINIMUM - BOILING OR POSITIVE AZEOTROPE Section::::Minimum - boiling or Positive azeotrope .
The boiling and recondensation of a mixture of two solvents are changes of chemical state ; as such , they are best illustrated with a phase diagram .
If the pressure is held constant , the two variable parameters are the temperature and the composition .
The phase diagram on the right shows a positive azeotrope of hypothetical constituents , X and Y.
The bottom trace illustrates the boiling temperature of various compositions .
Below the bottom trace , only the liquid phase is in equilibrium .
The top trace illustrates the vapor composition above the liquid at a given temperature .
Above the top trace , only the vapor is in equilibrium .
Between the two traces , liquid and vapor phases exist simultaneously in equilibrium : for example , heating a 25 % X : 75 % Y mixture
to temperature AB would generate vapor of composition B over liquid of composition A.
The azeotrope is the point on the diagram where the two curves touch .
The horizontal and vertical steps show the path of repeated distillations .
Point A is the boiling point of a nonazeotropic mixture .
The vapor that separates at that temperature has composition
B.
The shape of the curves requires that the vapor at B be richer in constituent X than the liquid at point A.
The vapor is physically separated from the VLE ( vapor - liquid equilibrium ) system and is cooled to point C , where it condenses .
The resulting liquid ( point C ) is now richer in X than it was at point A.
If the collected liquid is boiled again , it progresses to point D , and so on .
The stepwise progression shows how repeated distillation can never produce a distillate that is richer in constituent X than the azeotrope .
Note that starting to the right of the azeotrope point results in the same stepwise process closing in on the azeotrope point from the other direction .
MAXIMUM - BOILING OR NEGATIVE AZEOTROPE Section::::Maximum - boiling or Negative azeotrope .
The phase diagram on the right shows a negative azeotrope of ideal constituents , X and Y. Again the bottom trace illustrates the boiling temperature at various compositions , and again , below the bottom trace the mixture must be entirely liquid phase .
The top trace again illustrates the condensation temperature of various compositions , and again , above the top trace the mixture must be entirely vapor phase .
The point , A , shown here is a boiling point with a composition chosen very near to the azeotrope .
The vapor is collected at the same temperature at point B.
That vapor is cooled , condensed , and collected at point C. Because this example is a negative azeotrope rather than a positive one , the distillate is farther from the azeotrope than the original liquid mixture at
point A was .
So the distillate is poorer in constituent X and richer in constituent Y than the original mixture .
Because this process has removed a greater fraction of Y from the liquid than it had originally , the residue must be poorer in Y and richer in X after distillation than before .
If the point , A had been chosen to the right of the azeotrope rather than to the left , the distillate at point C would be farther to the right than A , which is to say that the distillate would be richer in X and poorer in Y than the original mixture .
So in this case too , the distillate moves away from the azeotrope and the residue moves toward it .
This is characteristic of negative azeotropes .
No amount of distillation , however , can make either the distillate or the residue arrive on the opposite side of the azeotrope from the original mixture .
This is characteristic of all azeotropes .
TRACES Section::::Traces .
The traces in the phase diagrams separate whenever the composition of the vapor differs from the composition of the liquid at the same temperature .
Suppose the total composition were 50/50 % .
You could make this composition using 50 % of 50/50 % vapor and 50 % of 50/50 % liquid , but you could also make it from 83.33 % of 45/55 % vapor and 16.67 % of 75%/25 % liquid , as well as from many other combinations .
The separation of the two traces represents the range of combinations of liquid and vapor that can make each total composition .
TEMPERATURE - PRESSURE DEPENDENCE Section::::Temperature - pressure dependence .
For both the top and bottom traces , the temperature point of the azeotrope is the constant temperature chosen for the graph .
If the ambient pressure is controlled to be equal to the total vapor pressure at the azeotropic mixture , then the mixture will boil at this fixed temperature .
Vapor pressure of both pure liquids as well as mixtures is a sensitive function of temperature .
As a rule , vapor pressure of a liquid increases nearly exponentially as a function of temperature .
If the graph were replotted for a different fixed temperature , then the total vapor pressure at the azeotropic composition will certainly change , but it is also possible that the composition at which the azeotrope occurs will change .
This implies that the composition of an azeotrope is affected by the pressure chosen at which to boil the mixture .
Ordinarily distillation is done at atmospheric pressure , but with proper equipment it is possible to carry out distillation at a wide variety of pressures , both above and below atmospheric pressure .
SEPARATION OF CONSTITUENTS Section::::Separation of constituents .
If two solvents can form a negative azeotrope , then distillation of any mixture of those constituents will result in the residue being away from the composition at the azeotrope than the original mixture .
For example , if a hydrochloric acid solution contains less than 20.2 % hydrogen chloride , boiling the mixture will leave behind a solution that is richer in hydrogen chloride than the original .
If the solution initially contains more than 20.2 % hydrogen chloride , then boiling will leave behind a solution that is poorer in hydrogen chloride than the original .
Boiling of any hydrochloric acid solution long enough will cause the solution left behind to approach the azeotropic ratio ..
On the other hand , if two solvents can form a positive azeotrope , then distillation of any mixture of those constituents will result in the residue closer to the composition at the azeotrope than the original mixture .
For example , if a 50/50 mixture of ethanol and water is distilled once , the distillate will be 80 % ethanol and 20 % water , which is closer to the azeotropic mixture than the original , which means the solution left behind will be poorer in ethanol .
Distilling the 80/20 % mixture produces a distillate that is 87 % ethanol and 13 % water .
Further repeated distillations will produce mixtures that are progressively closer to the azeotropic ratio of 95.5/4.5 % .
No numbers of distillations will ever result in a distillate that exceeds the azeotropic ratio .
Likewise , when distilling a mixture of ethanol and water that is richer in ethanol than the azeotrope , the distillate ( contrary to intuition ) will be poorer in ethanol than the original but still richer than the azeotrope .
Distillation is one of the primary tools that chemists and chemical engineers use to separate mixtures into their constituents .
Because distillation can not separate the constituents of an azeotrope , the separation of azeotropic mixtures ( also called azeotrope breaking ) is a topic of considerable interest .
Indeed , this difficulty led some early investigators to believe that azeotropes were actually compounds of their constituents .
But there are two reasons for believing that this is not the case .
One is that the molar ratio of the constituents of an azeotrope is not generally the ratio of small integers .
For example , the azeotrope formed by water and acetonitrile contains 2.253 moles ( or 9/4 with a relative error of just 2 % ) of acetonitrile for each mole of water .
A more compelling reason for believing that azeotropes are not compounds is , as discussed in the last section , that the composition of an azeotrope can be affected by pressure .
Contrast that with a true compound , carbon dioxide for example , which is two moles of oxygen for each mole of carbon no matter what pressure the gas is observed at .
That azeotropic composition can be affected by pressure suggests a means by which such a mixture can be separated .
PRESSURE SWING
DISTILLATION Section::::Pressure swing distillation .
A hypothetical azeotrope of constituents
X and Y is shown in the adjacent diagram .
Two sets of curves on a phase diagram one at an arbitrarily chosen low pressure and another at an arbitrarily chosen , but higher , pressure .
The composition of the azeotrope is substantially different between the high- and low - pressure plots – higher in X for the high - pressure system .
The goal is to separate X in as high a concentration as possible starting from point A.
At the low pressure , it is possible by progressive distillation to reach a distillate at the point , B , which is on the same side of the azeotrope as A. Note that successive distillation steps near the azeotropic composition exhibit very little difference in boiling temperature .
If this distillate is now exposed to the high pressure , it boils at point C. From C , by progressive distillation it is possible to reach a distillate at the point D , which is on the same side of the high - pressure azeotrope as C.
If that distillate is then exposed again to the low pressure , it boils at point E , which is on the opposite side of the low - pressure azeotrope to A.
So , by means of the pressure swing , it is possible to cross over the low - pressure azeotrope .
When the solution is boiled at point E , the distillate is poorer in X than the residue at point
E.
This means that the residue is richer in X than the distillate at point E. Indeed , progressive distillation can produce a residue as rich in X as is required .
In summary : 1 . Low - pressure rectification ( A to B ) 2 .
High - pressure rectification ( C to D ) 3 .
Low - pressure stripping ( E to target purity )
* Rectification : the distillate , or " tops " , is retained and exhibits an increasingly lower boiling point .
* Stripping : the residue , or " bottoms " , is retained and exhibits an increasingly higher boiling point .
Note that both azeotropes above are of the positive , or minimum boiling type ; care must be taken to ensure that the correct component of the separation step is retained , i.e. the binary phase - envelope diagram ( boiling - point curve ) must be correctly read .
A mixture of 5 % water with 95 % tetrahydrofuran is an example of an azeotrope that can be economically separated using a pressure swing – a swing in this case between 1 atm and 8 atm .
By contrast the composition of the water to ethanol azeotrope discussed earlier is not affected enough by pressure to be easily separated using pressure swings and instead , an entrainer may be added that either modifies the azeotropic composition and exhibits immiscibility with one of the components , or extractive distillation may be used .
AZEOTROPIC DISTILLATION
Section::::Azeotropic distillation .
Other methods of separation involve introducing an additional agent , called an entrainer , that will affect the volatility of one of the azeotrope constituents more than another .
When an entrainer is added to a binary azeotrope to form a ternary azeotrope , and the resulting mixture distilled , the method is called azeotropic distillation .
The best known example is adding benzene or cyclohexane to the water / ethanol azeotrope .
With cyclohexane as the entrainer , the ternary azeotrope is 7 % water , 17 % ethanol , and 76 % cyclohexane , and boils at 62.1 ° C .
Just enough cyclohexane is added to the water / ethanol azeotrope to engage all of the water into the ternary azeotrope .
When the mixture is then boiled , the azeotrope vaporizes leaving a residue composed almost entirely of the excess ethanol .
CHEMICAL ACTION
SEPARATION Section::::Chemical action separation .
Another type of entrainer is one that has a strong chemical affinity for one of the constituents .
Using again the example of the water / ethanol azeotrope , the liquid can be shaken with calcium oxide , which reacts strongly with water to form the nonvolatile compound , calcium hydroxide .
Nearly all of the calcium hydroxide can be separated by filtration and the filtrate redistilled to obtain 100 % pure ethanol .
A more extreme example is the azeotrope of 1.2 % water with 98.8 % diethyl ether .
Ether holds the last bit of water so tenaciously that only a very powerful desiccant such as sodium metal added to the liquid phase can result in completely dry ether .
Anhydrous calcium chloride is used as a desiccant for drying a wide variety of solvents since it is inexpensive and does not react with most nonaqueous solvents .
Chloroform is an example of a solvent that can be effectively dried using calcium chloride .
DISTILLATION USING A DISSOLVED SALT Section::::Distillation using a dissolved salt .
When a salt is dissolved in a solvent , it always has the effect of raising the boiling point of that solvent –
that is it decreases the volatility of the solvent .
When the salt is readily soluble in one constituent of a mixture but not in another , the volatility of the constituent in which it is soluble is decreased and the other constituent is unaffected .
In this way , for example , it is possible to break the water / ethanol azeotrope by dissolving potassium acetate in it and distilling the result .
EXTRACTIVE DISTILLATION Section::::Extractive distillation .
Extractive distillation is similar to azeotropic distillation , except in this case the entrainer is less volatile than any of the azeotrope 's constituents .
For example , the azeotrope of 20 % acetone with 80 % chloroform can be broken by adding water and distilling the result .
The water forms a separate layer in which the acetone preferentially dissolves .
The result is that the distillate is richer in chloroform than the original azeotrope .
PERVAPORATION AND OTHER MEMBRANE METHODS Section::::Pervaporation and other membrane methods .
The pervaporation method uses a membrane that is more permeable to the one constituent than to another to separate the constituents of an azeotrope as it passes from liquid to vapor phase .
The membrane is rigged to lie between the liquid and vapor phases .
Another membrane method is vapor permeation , where the constituents pass through the membrane entirely in the vapor phase .
In all membrane methods , the membrane separates the fluid passing through it into a permeate ( that which passes through ) and a retentate ( that which is left behind ) .
When the membrane is chosen so that is it more permeable to one constituent than another , then the permeate will be richer in that first constituent than the retentate .
COMPLEX SYSTEMS Section::::Complex systems .
The rules for positive and negative azeotropes apply to all the examples discussed so far .
But there are some examples that do n't fit into the categories of positive or negative azeotropes .
The best known of these is the ternary azeotrope formed by 30 % acetone , 47 % chloroform , and 23 % methanol , which boils at 57.5 ° C .
Each pair of these constituents forms a binary azeotrope , but chloroform / methanol and acetone / methanol both form positive azeotropes while chloroform / acetone forms a negative azeotrope .
The resulting ternary azeotrope is neither positive nor negative .
Its boiling point falls between the boiling points of acetone and chloroform , so it is neither a maximum nor a minimum boiling point .
This type of system is called a saddle azeotrope .
Only systems of three or more constituents can form saddle azeotropes .
A rare type of complex binary azeotrope is one where the boiling point and condensation point curves touch at two points in the phase diagram .
Such a system is called a double azeotrope , and will have two azeotropic compositions and boiling points .
An example is water and N - methylethylenediamine .
