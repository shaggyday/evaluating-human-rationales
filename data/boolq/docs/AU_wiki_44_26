BACHELOR OF EDUCATION
A Bachelor of Education ( B.Ed . ) is a graduate professional degree which prepares students for work as a teacher in schools , though in some countries additional work must be done in order for the student to be fully qualified to teach .
USA AND CANADA Section::::USA and Canada .
In the United States and Canada , this degree is awarded for coursework completed within a program lasting one to five years , depending on the requirements established by the place where the province or state in which the university is located .
In Canada , a B.Ed . degree is required for teaching certification .
A B.Ed . program may have direct entry from high school ; as a combined degree with another bachelor 's degree ( e.g. , B.A./B.Ed . ) ; or as an after - degree program where the candidate has obtained a bachelor 's degree , usually in the field in which the student wishes to teach .
A good rapport or previous experience with young children or teens is also a desired characteristic of applicants .
There are several streams to a Bachelor of Education , each corresponding to the particular level of instruction .
In the United States , this includes elementary school education , middle school education , and high school education .
Students in the elementary education stream generally study for a Liberal Studies degree .
In the high school ( secondary education ) stream , the student specializes in one to two subject areas .
Upon completion of the degree , they will prepare and eventually sit for the state 's Board of Education certification examination .

AUSTRALIA Section::::Australia .
In Australia , a 4-Year Bachelor of Education degree combines practical / pedagogical study with a Major sequence in the academic discipline of Education .
In the majority of Australian universities , there is usually 2 distinct types of the Bachelor of Education : Primary and Secondary .
The subjects and degree programs are quite different in both degrees e.g. for a student studying the Bachelor of Education ( Primary ) the focus of their degree would lie in behaviour , children , basic literacy , how children learn etc .
For a student studying the Bachelor of Education ( Secondary ) they would therefore be teaching roughly 11- to 18-year - old adolescents and their programs would have less focus on those kinds of areas by the Primary degree .
Instead , the degree is based around the student 's intending teaching subjects ; usually 1 or 2 .
In NSW , these teaching areas provide the major focus for their degrees in their final years .
They consist of : English , Mathematics , Science ( Biology , Physics & Chemistry ) , Geography , History , Business Studies , Legal Studies , Economics , Society & Culture and Languages .
The longer duration of the course allows for more practical experiences and greater personal or professional development before teaching service .
Most Australian State Teacher - Certification bodies require either a Bachelor of Education , or a bachelor 's degree in one or two subject areas , with a Graduate Diploma in Education as a minimum .
A
B.Ed .
is not to be confused with the lesser degree Bachelor of Teaching , which is usually an ' End - On ' course similar but slightly longer than a Graduate Diploma in Education .

In Australia , the term Undergraduate Degree is used to describe all degrees undertaken by a first - time university student and usually no pre - requisite tertiary level studies are required , mostly just the completion of Secondary High School .

SRI LANKA Section::::Sri Lanka .
The Bachelor of Education degree was first introduced by the University of Ceylon ( Sri Lanka ) in 1963 .
Prof. J. E. Jayasuriya , then Professor of Education at University of Ceylon introduced the course to meet the growing demand for professional teacher qualifications .
Then the practice was to join the teaching profession with a bachelor 's degree either in Arts or Sciences and after four years of teaching in a Secondary school teachers get the One year Post - Graduate Diploma in Education .
The University of Ceylon used to take only 50 -60 Post Graduate Diploma candidates at a time in an annual program .
The B.Ed . degree was introduced combining the bachelor 's degree and the Post Graduate Diploma in Education .
B.Ed . was introduced as a four - year special degree and in contrast with the 9 - 10 3hr papers at the final degree examination , a B.Ed . degree required a candidates to sit for 19 - 20 papers for the finals .
This happened due to combining of the bachelor 's degree and the Post - graduate Diploma in Education .
Only the top performing students were admitted to B.Ed . degree at University of Ceylon , Peradeniya .
The first batch graduated in 1967 .
Following this Australia introduced the B.Ed . degree .
Upali M Sedere was the first First Class holder of the B.Ed . degree from University of Ceylon , Peradeniya in 1969 .
Subsequently , in 1973 , the B.Ed . program at the University of Sri Lanka changed in its scope and character .
UNITED KINGDOM Section::::United Kingdom .
In the United Kingdom , where both the university system and school system are very different , the degree is awarded after a three or four - year course ( the course length depends on the university ) which is specifically tailored to either primary education or for a limited range of secondary education subjects .
It leads to Qualified Teacher Status ( QTS ) in England and Wales and is a teaching qualification in Scotland and Northern Ireland .
As a result of the Robbins Report on higher education ( 1963 ) , the teacher training colleges were reformed as Colleges of Education .
Such colleges , as in the case of those in London , became ' constituent colleges ' of the Institute of Education , with their academic award being from the University of London .
Students were offered an extra year of study , bringing the course up to four years in length and resulting in the award of the Bachelor of Education degree .
The first Bachelors of Education graduated in 1968 .
The BEd became more widespread in the early 1980s , when a bachelor 's degree became a requirement for new teachers in the whole of the United Kingdom , replacing the old Certificate in Education ( Cert Ed ) .
The BEd is not the only way of gaining Qualified Teacher Status or gaining a teaching qualification .

( B.SC.ED . ) Section::::Bachelor of Science Education ( B.Sc .
Ed . ) .
A Bachelor of Science Education is a degree awarded to students who complete the four to five - year course of study in the field of science ( major and minor in biology , chemistry , physics , and math ) with major Educational courses .
It is the combination of degrees in science and education course ( sometimes referred to double degree programs B.Sc +
B.Ed . =
B.Sc .
Ed . ) .
Even though B.Sc and B.Ed . are notionally two degrees , they must be taken together .
There are very few universities that offer this course because it requires collaboration between the Faculty / School of Science and that of Education , to ensure that the teacher not only can work in an education institution but also in an industrial area related to science .
In Malaysia , it is one of the most difficult admittance degrees for the students to get into .
Students not only need a distinction result but also need to go through a psychology test , rigorous interviews and demos of teaching .
Students who already get these courses will be given a full scholarship by the Minister of Education .
Upon graduation , the students will get job offers from government and private institutions ( mostly to teach for matriculation , foundation or high school students ) due to deep understanding of specific science and professional teaching training .
Graduates also can work in other science related industries .
Bachelor of Science and Education is totally different from Bachelor of Science in Education .
In Singapore , the National Institute of Education , an autonomous institute of Nanyang Technological University , offers a four - year undergraduate programme , offering B.Sc.(Ed . )
or B.A.(Ed . )
in its initial teacher training programmes .
Students are taught pedagogical theories and principles , alongside their chosen subject majors ( and minors ) .
