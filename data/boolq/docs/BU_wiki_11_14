HISTORY Section::::History .
William ( Bill )
Darden opened his first restaurant , The Green Frog , in his hometown of Waycross , Georgia in 1938 at age 19 .
The restaurant , which grew quickly , formed the basis of the organization that later became known as Darden Restaurants .
He later founded the Red Lobster Inns of America and opened the first Red Lobster restaurant in Lakeland , Florida in 1968 .
Darden chose Lakeland because he wished to see how a seafood restaurant would fare in a non - coastal region , and Lakeland was the innermost city in Florida .
The initial Red Lobster franchise was applauded by diners and critics alike .
The store became successful and by 1970 had expanded to three locations in the state with two more under construction .
While the locations were profitable , the company lacked the resources to expand further , so Darden sold the company to food giant General Mills that year .
GENERAL MILLS OWNERSHIP
Section::::General Mills ownership .
General Mills upgraded the chain to a more casual dining / family fare oriented format , opened a new company headquarters in Orlando and retained Darden as company manager .
In 1975 , when Darden was promoted to Vice President of General Mills , Joseph
( Joe ) R. Lee , the company 's first restaurant manager , was promoted as President of Red Lobster .
Under General Mills ownership , Red Lobster expanded into a chain of almost 400 locations by 1985 .
The company underwent several restructurings and transformed itself from an inexpensive fast - food seller into a chain of casual dining seafood restaurants by 1988 .
One of the company 's first ventures into the diversification of its portfolio was the York Steak House chain of English - themed steak and chop restaurants in the 1970s .
The franchised steak and potatoes restaurant was a cafeteria - style restaurant with salad bar and hot station .
By the end of the 1980s , the chain had been mostly closed down , though some independent locations still exist .
These places were very similar to Ruby Tuesday now .
In 1982 , Darden opened the first Olive Garden concept store in Orlando .
The chain took off , and by 1989 General Mills had opened over 145 stores , making the chain the fastest - growing unit in the company 's restaurant holdings .
While Olive Garden did not meet critical success , it was popular , and its per - store sales soon grew to match those of Red Lobster .
The company eventually became the largest chain of Italian - themed full - service restaurants in the United States .
In 1990 , China Coast was launched as an attempt to create a ( U.S. ) national casual dining restaurant that featured American Chinese cuisine .
While the chain eventually expanded to some 50 restaurants , its sales were lackluster and lost an estimated US$ 20 million .
By the end of 1995 , the company was shuttered , and the remaining locations were either converted to Red Lobsters or Olive Gardens or closed altogether .

The company then began testing a new concept entitled Smokey Bones BBQ Sports Bar that opened in late 1999 in Orlando .
The restaurant is a sports bar concept featuring barbecue and related foodstuffs in an Appalachian mountain - lodge setting .
In 2003 , Seasons 52 was under development with the idea of " provide guests the opportunity to indulge while still eating well " .

RED LOBSTER
SALE Section::::Red Lobster sale .
On December 19 , 2013 , Darden announced plans to sell or spin - off the Red Lobster brand , citing pressure from stock investors .
This was in direct response to the company spending US$ 100 million on a new digital platform .
At the time , the project was already at least one year behind schedule and above budget .
A large number of layoffs occurred in its marketing department , and the company 's second in command also left .
On May 12 , 2014 , Darden announced that as part of the spinoff of Red Lobster , it was converting the co - located Red Lobster and Olive Garden locations into standalone Olive Garden locations .

Darden announced the completion of the sale of Red Lobster on July 28 , 2014 .
ACQUISITIONS Section::::Acquisitions .
Differences between Starboard and Darden management soon emerged over the hedge fund 's proposal to split the company in two and spin off a third to handle their real estate portfolio , a move Starboard said would greatly boost shareholder value .
Matters came to head when management announced a plan to spin off the underperforming Red Lobster early in 2014 .
Starboard led a large group of investors in asking management to delay the move and see if better options , such as its plans to revitalize the chain , were available .
When management instead decided to sell the chain to private equity firm Golden Gate Capital in May , Starboard and other investors sharply criticized the $ 2.1 billion " fire sale " price as a serious undervaluing of Red Lobster and its assets such as the underlying real estate .
It also claimed management had refused shareholders ' requests for a special meeting to discuss the deal .
Chief Executive Officer Clarence Otis , Jr. announced he would be resigning at the end of the year , the same day the Red Lobster sale was complete .
Management said afterwards that it would work on a needed turnaround plan for Olive Garden , also struggling .
However , after CNBC reported on a leaked document , supposedly offered to potential lenders and buyers earlier in the year , that described Red Lobster 's financial position far more optimistically than management had in its contemporary public statements , one of the investors , a union pension fund , filed suit alleging material misrepresentation .
Management claimed the document had been prepared by Golden Gate in consultation with Red Lobster 's executives , who could have been expected to have that view of the chain 's future .
Eugene Lee was named permanent CEO on February 23 , 2015 , after serving as interim CEO in October 2014 .
Starboard assembled its own slate of directors to challenge all the sitting board members in the company 's upcoming shareholder elections .
In support of their candidacy it released a 294-slide presentation in early September about how the company had gone wrong and how its directors would restore it to health .
While it received considerable media attention for its detailed focus on Olive Garden , in particular the chain 's " wasteful " practice of serving too many of its free unlimited breadsticks at once ( to prevent food waste due to staleness : instead of one per customer plus an additional one per table ; additional breadsticks are served fresh on demand ) and not salting the water it boiled pasta in so as to secure a longer warranty on the pots , it also attacked management for spending lavishly on the chain 's corporate headquarters while paying the general managers of individual restaurants less than its competitors did .
Management responded two days later that it was already implementing many of the suggested changes , and said the free breadsticks merely represented " Italian generosity " .
Nevertheless , in October , shareholders replaced the entire board with Starboard 's slate , in what an observer called an " epic fail " for management , since that rarely happens .
On March 27 , 2017 , Darden announced its intent to acquire Cheddar 's Scratch Kitchen for $ 780 million from shareholders such as L Catterton and Oak Investment Partners .
On March 28 , 2017 , when Darden announced it that had acquired Cheddar 's Scratch Kitchen and " lifted its full - year earnings outlook , " the company became the biggest gainer that day on the S&P 500 , with shares growing nearly 9 percent .
The acquisition was completed on April 24 , 2017 .
