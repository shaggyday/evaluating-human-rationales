PLOT Section::::Plot .
At Kuranose High School in Tokyo , Japan , Makoto Konno discovers a message written on a blackboard and inadvertently falls upon a walnut - shaped object .
On her way home , Makoto is ejected into a railroad crossing when the brakes on her bicycle fail and is hit by an oncoming train , but finds herself transported back to the point in time when she was riding her bicycle right before the accident .
After entering the Tokyo National Museum to meet with Kazuko Yoshiyama , she explains to Makoto that she has the power to " time - leap " , to literally leap through time .
At first , Makoto uses her powers to avoid being late , getting perfect grades , and even relive a single karaoke session for several hours , but soon discovers that her actions can adversely affect others .
Consequently , Makoto uses most of her leaps frivolously , to prevent undesirable situations from happening , including an awkward love confession from her best friend Chiaki Mamiya .
Makoto realizes that she has a numbered tattoo on her arm indicating the limited number of times she can time leap .
Using her remaining time leaps , Makoto attempts to make things right for everyone .
When Chiaki calls Makoto to ask if she has been time - leaping , she uses her final time leap to prevent Chiaki 's call .
In the meantime , Makoto 's friend Kōsuke Tsuda and his new girlfriend , Kaho Fujitani , borrow her faulty bike .
Makoto attempts to stop them , but because she had just used her final leap , she is unable to rescue them from the train .
A moment later , Chiaki freezes time , telling Makoto that he is from the future .
He explains that the walnut - shaped object is a time - traveling device , and he used it to leap through time hoping to see a painting that is being restored by Kazuko , as it has been destroyed in the future .
While walking with Makoto in the frozen city , Chiaki also explains why he stayed longer in her time frame than he originally planned .
Consequently , he has used his final leap to ensure Kōsuke 's existence and has stopped time only to explain to Makoto what the results will be .
Having revealed his origins and the nature of the item that allowed Makoto to leap through time , and now unable to return to his own time period , Chiaki must leave .
Makoto then realizes that she loves him .
True to his words , Chiaki disappears once time resumes .
Initially distraught by Chiaki 's disappearance , Makoto discovers that Chiaki 's time - leap inadvertently restored her final time - leap : Chiaki had leaped back to the time before Makoto used it .
Makoto uses it to safely leap back to the moment right after she originally gained her powers , at which point Chiaki still has one remaining time - leap , and recovers the used up time - travel device .
Makoto explains her knowledge of everything as she shows the device to Chiaki .
Makoto vows to ensure the painting 's existence
so Chiaki can see it in his era .
Before Chiaki departs , he tells Makoto that he will be waiting for her in the future .
When Kōsuke asks her where Chiaki went , she says that he went to study abroad , and that she made a decision about her own future .
