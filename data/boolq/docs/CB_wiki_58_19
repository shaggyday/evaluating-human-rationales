WITHDRAWN CANADIAN BANKNOTES Banknotes that are no longer in issue in Canada , and are being removed from circulation , are said to be withdrawn from circulation .
CURRENT ISSUES Section::::Current issues .
The Bank of Canada , Canada 's sole issuer of bank notes , currently issues five different denominations ( $ 5 , $ 10 , $ 20 , $ 50 and $ 100 ) .
Smaller denominations have been replaced by coins , and larger ones are felt to be no longer required in an era of electronic transmission of most large transactions .
Despite competition from some more valuable foreign notes ( most notably , the 500 euro banknote ) , there are no plans to re - issue Canadian banknotes larger than $ 100 .
DEFUNCT CURRENCY Section::::Defunct currency .
Notes issued by these former issuing authorities are considered to be withdrawn from circulation :
* Colonial governments , prior to each province or dominion entering confederation .
* The Dominion of Canada between 1870 and 1935 , which issued notes in denominations of 25Â¢ , $ 1 , $ 2 , $ 4 , $ 5 , $ 50 , $ 100 , $ 500 , and $ 1,000 * Canadian chartered banks , from pre - Confederation to 1944 .
BANK OF CANADA NOTES Section::::Bank of Canada notes .
All Bank of Canada notes issued prior to the current Frontier Series are being withdrawn from circulation .
The following Bank of Canada denominations included in previous series have been permanently retired : $ 25 Section::::$25 .
The $ 25 note was issued only in 1935 , to commemorate the silver jubilee of King George V. As with other 1935 issues , separate English and French versions were printed .
This was a limited release that was never printed in large quantities .
The note was coloured an appropriate royal purple ; both the King & his consort Queen Mary were featured , with Windsor Castle appearing on the back .
The $ 25 note was withdrawn from circulation in 1937 .
$ 500 Section::::$500 .
The $ 500 denomination was included only in the 1935 series .
No note of this denomination has been printed since .
The note was coloured sepia , or burnt sienna ; the face featured Sir John A. Macdonald , and
the back depicted a fertility allegory .
The $ 500 note was withdrawn from circulation in 1938 .
There had been two previous printings of the $ 500 note by the Dominion of Canada , one in 1925 featuring King George V , and one in 1911 picturing Queen Mary .
Of the latter , only three are known to still exist , one of which sold for US$ 322,000 in a Heritage auction in October 2008 .
It is unlikely that further 1911 notes survived the Depression .
$ 1 Section::::$1 .
Printing of the $ 1 note ceased in 1989 after the release of the loonie ( in 1987 ) had been implemented .
These notes are virtually never seen in circulation today .
The most recent banknote series that included the $ 1 note was the Scenes of Canada , with the $ 1 note released in 1974 , coloured green and black .
The face featured a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II ; the back featured an image of Parliament Hill from across the Ottawa River , with log driving activities taking place on the water .
$ 2 Section::::$2 .
Printing of the $ 2 note ceased on February 18 , 1996 , with initial release of the toonie , a coin that replaced it .
These notes are virtually never seen in circulation today .
The most recent banknote series that included the two - dollar note was the Birds of Canada series in 1986 , in which this note was a terra cotta colour .
The face featured a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II ; the back featured a meadow scene with two robins .
Prior to the withdrawal of the $ 1 note , the $ 2 was not as widely circulated and was difficult to find in some regions , Alberta in particular .
After the $ 1 note was withdrawn , the $ 2 was much more widely circulated .
$ 1,000
Section::::$1,000 .
Printing of the $ 1,000 note ceased in 2000 .
The denomination was withdrawn on the advice of the Solicitor General and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police ( RCMP ) , as it was often used for money laundering and organized crime .
The Bank of Canada has requested that financial institutions return $ 1,000 notes for destruction .
The most recent issue of this denomination was in 1992 as part of the Birds of Canada series .
It was pink in colour , featuring Queen Elizabeth II on the face , and two pine grosbeaks on the back .
STATUS OF WITHDRAWN BANKNOTES Section::::Status of withdrawn banknotes .
Currency withdrawn from circulation remains legal tender , but this does not obligate any creditor to accept it as a medium of exchange .
Withdrawn currency is usually exchanged at commercial bank branches , though some banks require that exchangers be bank customers .
The bank then returns the withdrawn currency , together with worn out currency , to the Bank of Canada for destruction .
Liabilities for outstanding provincial and Dominion of Canada notes was transferred to the Bank of Canada in 1935 , and liability for chartered bank notes in 1950 .
As of December 31 , 2016 , the total value of provincial , Dominion , chartered bank , and discontinued Bank of Canada denominations still outstanding is $ 1.139 billion , of which more than $ 765 million is in $ 1,000 notes .
The liability for this amount remains on the Bank of Canada 's books up to the present day .
On February 27 , 2018 , The Government of Canada announced in their 2018 Federal Budget that there are plans to make all withdrawn banknotes no longer legal tender .
If passed into law , these notes will still retain face value and may still be redeemed at banks in exchange for current banknotes .
The current five denominations - $ 5 , $ 10 , $ 20 , $ 50 and $ 100 - will not be affected at this time , but the government may decide to remove legal tender status from older series versions of these denominations in the future .
