In season 6B , Stiles is now an intern for the FBI in Virginia .
He is surprised the FBI happened to be hunting Derek Hale for mass murder .
In the series finale , Stiles and Derek reunite with Scott and his pack to stop the hunters and the Anuk - Ite .
Two years later , Stiles is seen with Scott , Lydia , Malia , Derek , Liam , and a beta named Alec planning to stop Monroe and the hunters .
" Teen Wolf : The Hunt " , a Teen Wolf - inspired social network game , states that Stiles was born on April 8 .
He likes drumming , snowboarding , and the New York Mets .
He is a fan of the bands The Ramones , The Offspring , Mumford and Sons , All Time Low and Slow Kids At Play ( Dylan O'Brien 's band in real life , in which he plays drums ) .
Derek Hale is a werewolf by birth .
Derek lived in Beacon Hills with his family , a Pack of both werewolves and humans , and his mother Talia Hale being Alpha .
When he was 15 , Derek fell in love with a girl named Paige .
His uncle Peter came up with the idea of turning her into a werewolf so they could be together long term .
Ennis , an Alpha werewolf , gave her the Bite although it is not clear if Peter asked him to or if he took action on his own .
Derek , hearing Paige 's screams , was too late to save her and saw that Paige was rejecting the Bite .
Derek attempted to pull Paige 's pain out of her , but it was too intense and she asked him to end her suffering .
Mercy killing her caused his werewolf eyes to change from yellow to blue .
Later on , Kate Argent seduced Derek and committed statutory rape .
Derek was unaware she was a hunter and was only using him to get information on the Hales .
Kate burned the Hale House down , killing most of Derek 's family and rendering Peter comatose .
Derek and his older sister Laura left Beacon Hills for New York soon after .
Due to his tragic experiences , Derek became angry , sullen , misanthropic , cynical , defensive and mistrustful .
In Season 1 , Derek returns to Beacon Hills six years after the fire to investigate a mysterious Alpha who had Bitten Scott McCall and killed Laura .
He attempts to train Scott to help him control his new werewolf nature but Scott resists , blaming Derek for everything wrong in his life when Derek had nothing to do with it .
He is antagonistic towards the Argents , especially Kate , the murderer of his family , and immediately disapproves of Scott 's relationship with Allison .
Without any support system and desperate for help , he uses empty threats against Scott and Stiles as it is the only way anyone will help him .
In " Wolf 's Bane " , Derek discovers the Alpha is his uncle Peter who had murdered Laura to rise to Alpha status and his nurse
was helping him sending the message to Allison .
In the Season 1 finale , Derek becomes the new Alpha werewolf , killing Peter to stop him from continuing to take revenge on the people responsible for the Hale fire .
In Season 2 , Derek is on an initial power rush from the sudden power gain and sometimes acts rashly .
He attempts to recruit Scott into his Pack , but Scott still holds an unfounded grudge against him .
He goes on to Bite three students , Isaac , Erica , and Boyd , after informing them of the downsides and the threat of hunters .
He provides them with a chosen family of sorts and does his best to train them in hopes they will be able to survive together .
As the town becomes threatened by the Kanima , he sets out to kill it to prevent it from killing even more innocent lives .
As the dangers escalate , Erica and Boyd leave , frightened of the Argents ' werewolf genocide .
In the finale " Master Plan " , Scott forces a paralyzed Derek to bite Gerard Argent even as Derek begs Scott not to , convinced Gerard will kill him after in order to become alpha .
However , Gerard was poisoned with mountain ash in Deaton and Scott 's attempt to kill the hunter .
Rejected , used , and betrayed by Scott , Derek avoids him over the following summer even though he really could have used additional help .
The reason Derek was in a hurry to build his Pack and train them to survive was because an Alpha pack would be on the prowl for a development such as his rising to Alpha status .
In Season 3 , the Alpha Pack are in Beacon Hills ostensibly to recruit Derek , and are holding Erica and Boyd hostage .
Derek is devastated when Erica is found dead and is further emotionally shaken when he discovers his younger sister Cora is there and had survived the fire that killed their family .
When Boyd and Cora are feral under the full moon , Derek saves Jennifer Blake , the English teacher , from them .
She uses the power of virgin sacrifices in order to magically seduce and later rape him towards the middle of the season .
After discovering that Cora is alive , Derek displays a more caring and timid side of himself around her , becomes protective of her and seeking her approval from wanting to connect with one of his few remaining family members .
In " Currents " , Derek is shattered when the Alphas use his body against his will to kill Boyd .
Jennifer is later revealed to be the Darach who was making Human sacrifices across Beacon Hills , and had poisoned Cora with mistletoe for leverage against him to his anger .
Having almost no one left in his pack and fearing for his sister 's life , Derek gives up his Alpha status to save Cora from death .
He tricks Jennifer into using up most of her power healing Deucalion 's eyesight , giving Deucalion and later Peter the chance to kill her for good .
Derek leaves town with Cora for South America with the weight of his previous alpha responsibilities lifted from his shoulders .
In Season 3B , Derek , now an Omega werewolf once again , is on a mission with Peter in Mexico to retrieve his mother Talia 's claws which are in the possession of the Calavera family and had Cora go into hiding .
They retrieve the claws with the mercenary Braeden 's help .
After returning to Beacon Hills , Derek uses the claws in a ritual to communicate with Talia his late mother .
Derek meets with Scott , telling him Talia revealed to him the Hales did n't only live in Beacon Hills , they protected the town and it needs someone like Scott to continue protecting it .
Derek comes to solve his differences with Argent after he saves Argent 's life from a bomb set off by the Nogitsune , and Argent tells Derek they are n't enemies anymore right after the Nogitsune had controlled him to kill the former .
In the Season 3 finale , Derek and the twins face off against the Oni after bringing the triskele urn which held Talia 's claws because it could be used to seal the Dark Kitsune away .
Derek is last seen being cornered in his loft by the Calaveras .
Suddenly the hunters are attacked , and Derek comes face to face with a revealed - to - be - alive Kate Argent .
In the Season 4 premiere , " The Dark Moon " , Kate is holding Derek in Mexico , in an underground Aztec temple .
Scott 's Pack and Braeden rescue him , but Kate , using the magic of Tezcatlipoca , had Derek regressed in age and mind to 15 or 16 years old , the time of his life when he trusted Kate before she killed his family .
In the episode " 117 " , Kate used him to have him reveal to her the location of the Hale vault so she could steal a Triskelion medallion .
Later on , Derek fights Kate 's Berserkers , shifting to his werewolf form , and this causes him to return to his normal age , but his werewolf eye color has returned to gold .
He later realizes this means he 's gradually losing his werewolf power .
Derek hires Braeden to find Kate for him over her contract with the Calaveras .
Braeden accepts the job while simultaneously starting up a flirtation with him .
Derek and Malia later seek out the Pack of Satomi Ito after finding out they are on the Deadpool .
Tracking them , he finds Braeden injured , and takes her to the hospital .
Derek and Braeden start a casual relationship as she gives him lessons on how to use firearms , as well as hand - to - hand combat necessary for a human against supernatural foes .
He overpowers the assassins at the high school and protects Satomi 's Pack .
With Lydia arriving at his loft letting out a Banshee Scream , Derek contemplates the fact he may not come back alive on the mission to rescue Scott , sharing a final kiss with Braeden and refusing her weapons , implicitly ending their relationship .
Derek is wounded by a Berserker and later dies .
However , he revives with all of his powers restored and at their peak , destroying the Berserker , as well as gaining the talent to fully shapeshift into a wolf , like his mother Talia and sister Laura before him .
Derek learns he was actually Evolving all throughout Season 4 .
Derek and Braeden leave together , presumably back to Beacon Hills as they had n't packed for anything other than a rescue mission , and later go their separate ways .
Derek returns to Beacon Hills in the last two episodes of season 6 to help fight the hunters .
In the final flashforward , two years later , he 's shown to still be allied with Scott 's pack .
Lydia Martin is Beacon Hills High 's most popular student , a member of Scott 's Pack , the former love interest of both Jackson Whittemore and the werewolf Aiden , Allison Argent 's best friend , and ( revealed in Season 3 episode " The Girl Who Knew Too Much " ) is a banshee .
In Season 1 , Lydia at first appears to be the archetypal spoiled materialistic high school queen bee .
In reality she is surprisingly caring to her friends , befriending Allison on her first day at school .
Lydia is also extremely intelligent , having a GPA exceeding 5.0 .
Her boyfriend is Jackson Whittemore , although she initially makes it apparent she is merely dating him due to his status as the school 's lacrosse team captain , Lydia is actually in love with Jackson .
She initially barely knows who Scott and Stiles are , only expressing interest in Scott after he is Bitten and shows skill at lacrosse .
Stiles , throughout Seasons 1 and 2 , has an intense , sweet crush on Lydia , but she does not reciprocate .
In the Season 1 penultimate episode " Formality " , Lydia is Bitten by the Alpha Peter Hale , which starts to trigger her supernatural powers .
In the beginning of Season 2 , Lydia recovers , but suffers from a hallucination while in the shower and goes into a fugue state running through the woods naked for two days .
Afterwards she does n't remember the entire experience at all .
Lydia is determined to be immune to the Kanima 's venom , and thus Derek assumes she 's the Kanima , although it is later revealed to be Jackson .
Lydia suffers further fugue episodes and hallucinations which , along with Jackson 's rejection , causes her to have emotional breakdowns .
The hallucinations are caused by Peter , who planted memories of himself in Lydia 's mind from his Bite , possessing her to use her to resurrect himself .
As a result , she learns pieces of the supernatural events taking place .
In the Season 2 finale , Lydia selflessly faces the Kanima and successfully coaxes the shapeshifter to transform back into Jackson , by holding up the house key Jackson had given her when they were together .
When Jackson asks if she still loves him while he 's dying , she responds that she does and embraces him when he is cured of being a Kanima and resurrected as a werewolf .
By Season 3 , Lydia has been brought up to speed on the supernatural , has matured and come to care deeply for Scott and Stiles .
She and Jackson have parted since he moved to London and she is attempting to get over it .
Lydia enters into a purely physical relationship with Aiden , initially to distract herself from Jackson , unaware he was assigned to get close to her to get leverage on Scott .
Lydia displays a strange connection to the events occurring in Beacon Hills being mysteriously drawn to the locations of several of the sacrifices and occupying her time with drawing the same tree over and over again .
Lydia joins forces with Stiles to figure out who is really behind the sacrifices .
In " The Girl Who Knew Too Much " , when Cora Hale tells she , Scott and Stiles all they do is find bodies , not saving anyone , Lydia later appears at the memorial recital deciding to stop fighting her peculiar talents if it could help save someone with Scott offering his support .
Later she is held captive by Jennifer Blake , the Darach , who attempts to kill her and Lydia
lets out a high pitched Scream .
Jennifer then reveals to Lydia that she is actually a banshee .
Lydia later helps Stiles through a panic attack by kissing him .
She then begins to develop small mutual feelings for Stiles .
Lydia and Stiles find out the tree she 's been consistently drawing is an inversion of the Nemeton 's root system , which allows them to realize it is where the kidnapped parents are being held .
During Season 3B , though Lydia continues her liaison with Aiden , she eventually tells the werewolf that he is only a ' bad guy ' because he helped to kill Boyd , while she uses her abilities to help save lives .
Lydia 's talents allow for her to communicate on a network that predicts death : Jeff Davis has revealed this network is the whispers of other banshees .
The Nogitsune kidnaps Lydia in " Insatiable " and takes her to Oak Creek .
She senses the pending death of the Nogitsune - only this was the reason the he took her , to know in advance when the Oni would appear to kill him , so he would be able to take control of the demons .
Lydia had warned the others through a message relayed by fellow banshee Meredith Walker not to come for her , because she had sensed an impending death - Allison 's .
Lydia Screams for Allison when she 's impaled by an Oni and is overcome with grief as she feels her best friend 's death .
In the Season 3 finale , Lydia meets with Deaton and Scott , and comes up with the idea to use the Hales ' triskele urn to trap the Void kitsune .
Shortly after the Nogitsune 's defeat , she " feels " another death - this time it is Aiden .

Lydia helps Malia with her schoolwork by lending her notes .
She learns some of the notes is actually computer code she does n't remember transcribing .
Using her banshee talents , Lydia learns the computer code comprises the Dead Pool , a hit list of supernaturals in Beacon Hills as well as the first cipher key to decode the list : ALLISON .
Lydia immediately works on getting the other two cypher keys , later learning from Meredith the second is AIDEN .
Lydia cracks the final third of the Dead Pool but sees that Meredith is on the list .
She is saddened that Meredith has committed suicide out of fear .
Lydia later learns her paternal grandmother Lorraine was also a banshee ; she 'd written a list of names , part of the Dead Pool code which lead her and Stiles to Eichen House .
The twosome , along with Parrish , learn Lorraine was actually murdered by Brunski , that Meredith is alive and has been the Benefactor all along , and later on , Meredith 's history with Peter .

Jackson Whittemore is the - captain of the Beacon Hills lacrosse team and the captain of the school 's swim team .
Jackson 's birth parents were Gordon and Margaret Miller .
They died in a car crash on June 14 , 1995 , but Margaret was kept on life support long enough for the doctors to deliver Jackson by c - section into the middle of the night as his birthday is June 15th .
He was adopted by attorney David Whittemore and his wife .
In compensation for their deaths , Jackson is to receive a large insurance settlement on his eighteenth birthday .
Jackson is the big man on campus at Beacon Hills High , and has a competitive , self - absorbed and aggressive nature , which shows through hostility towards people who best him .
Jackson wishes to make others proud of him , this desire to always live up to people 's expectations appears to stem from his deeply rooted insecurity about his adoption and the fact that he does not know his real parents , leading him to be unable to see his adoptive parents as his true mom and dad .
Despite his abrasive character , he is shown to care for his friends and dislikes hurting them .
It turns out he is genuine friends with Danny Mahealani and he actually cares more for Lydia Martin than he lets on , though he 'd never admit it .
During Season 1 , Jackson is angered , suspicious by Scott 's sudden , seemingly impossible improvement on the lacrosse field and other activities repeatedly besting him , which impacts his psyche .
Consequently , he investigates Scott , eventually coming in contact with Derek Hale and being accidentally scratched by Derek in " Magic Bullet " ( who was poisoned with wolfsbane at the time and partially passes the poisoning onto Jackson through the claws ) , witnessing the Alpha werewolf in " Night School " .
He eventually discovers Scott is a werewolf .
Jackson threatens to expose Scott unless he helps him become one too .
The Argents grew suspicious of Jackson .
At the school formal he gets drunk and exposes Scott 's werewolf nature to them .
In the Season 1 finale , " Code Breaker " , he regrets turning Scott over to the Argents , and helps Scott , Allison and Stiles defeat the Alpha werewolf , Peter Hale .
Later Jackson appears the Hale house demanding the Bite from Derek because he helped him .
In the Season 2 premiere " Omega " , it is revealed Derek had Bitten Jackson , which he takes with absolute smugness .
However , Derek notices his body is rejecting the transformation , causing black blood to bleed out of his orifices .
In the fifth episode of Season 2 " Venomous " it is revealed Jackson instead became a Kanima , a murderous reptilian shapeshifter that is a weapon of vengeance .
Jackson , as the Kanima , commits numerous murders throughout Season 2 .
Jackson does not know that he is the Kanima , nor does the Kanima side of him know that it is Jackson .
In his Kanima form , Jackson was nigh unstoppable : he had enhanced strength and agility that far exceeded the werewolves , even Derek , the Alpha werewolf , the Kanima could heal from being shot by Argent repeatedly , Derek slashing its throat , and Allison putting an arrow in its head and stabbing it in the chest .
The Kanima 's claws also produced a paralytic poison that could completely immobilize a victim by the Kanima slashing the back of the neck and it could scale walls .
The Kanima seeks a Master who wishes to exact revenge on others to control the shapeshifter and the Kanima carries out whatever vengeance the Master bids , revealing that as the Kanima , Jackson 's every move is controlled by someone else .
In the episode " Fury " , it is revealed Jackson came across an unstable , traumatized student , Matt Daehler who became his Master .
Matt had the Kanima murder former Beacon Hills High students who almost caused him to drown when he was a little boy during a drunken pool party .
After Gerard Argent kills Matt , he becomes Jackson 's new Master .
It is revealed that Jackson became the Kanima because he is an orphan , exemplified by his outward behavior and personality , meaning he lacks an identity .
He can be saved by a person with whom he shared a true bond ; in Jackson 's case , this person is Lydia .
Through Lydia 's selflessness in the Season 2 finale , " Master Plan " , the Kanima reverts to Jackson .
Aware of what he is , Jackson then allows Derek and Peter Hale to kill him .
Dying , he asks Lydia does she still love him , she responds that she does .
Jackson returned to life and finally becomes a werewolf , however , with blue eyes rather than the common yellow .
His eyes as a werewolf are blue , because as the Kanima he took innocent lives ( regardless of his intent ) ; Derek , Peter , and the twins Ethan and Aiden share this feature .
In the Season 3 premiere , Lydia revealed that Jackson was trained by Derek to control his werewolf nature .
Later he and Lydia parted and his father moved him to London .
He is next seen late in season six , when he is revealed to be in a same - sex relationship with Ethan Steiner , another werewolf .
The pair live together in London attempting to find other werewolves , but are attacked by hunters linked to Gerard Argent .
Returning to Beacon Hills , they are captured by Gerard 's lieutenant , school guidance counselor Ms. Monroe , although they are later freed by Lydia and Stiles after Gerard reveals he has the pair captive .
When telling Lydia he is in a same - sex relationship now , she is initially startled and then happy that he " figured it out " .
He is seen checking out a female and male student in his brief scene at Beacon Hills High , and to have retained some of his kanima abilities , including venom , claws , and the ability to manifest kanima eyes and a kanima tail , but is unable to completely shift into one .
In the closing montage of the series finale , he and Ethan are shown happily together in London once more .
" Teen Wolf : The Hunt " , a Teen Wolf - inspired social network game , states that Jackson was born on June 15 .
He likes Porsche , Golden State Warriors , USC Trojans , and the San Jose Sharks , and is a fan of Wiz Khalifa , Nicki Minaj , Drake , and Gym Class Heroes .

As the series progress , Malia readjusts to her humanity .
In " Echo House " , Malia is interned at Eichen House sanatorium .
There , she sees Stiles who has voluntarily committed himself .
When he walks up to Malia , she attacks him aggressively .
Malia tells Stiles she is unhappy as a human , because she now lives back with her father and ca n't tell him that she killed her mom and sister , and Scott 's Alpha roar has caused her to remain human and unable to fully transform again .
Stiles , who needs access to the basement for information regarding the Nogitsune 's connection to Eichen House , specifically the kanji " self " on the wall , makes a deal with her : she helps him get into the basement , then Scott will teach her how to change back .
Very soon afterward , they sleep together .
Behind a wall in Eichen House , they find the Nogitsune 's original host 's body , a sheathed katana , and a photo .
Afterwards , they are attacked by Oliver , Stiles ' roommate , who is being controlled by the Nogitsune .

In Season 4 , Malia is continuing her romance with Stiles , with the Pack attempting to help her reintegrate back into society .
Malia has a survival - of - the - fittest mentality , as shown when she was willing to leave Lydia behind when the Pack was held captive by the Calaveras .
She regularly sneaks into Stiles ' house at night .
Malia is struggling in learning control during the full moon .
In " The Benefactor " , Stiles stays with her on the full moon while she is transformed into her werecoyote shape for the first time ; he surmises she lacks control because of her guilt in what she did to her mother and sister .
He relates to her because of the Nogitsune 's possession of him .
Malia perfects control at this .
The Pack keeps Malia in the dark that Peter Hale is her biological father , to protect her from the sociopathic werewolf .
But in " Weaponized " Malia discovers the truth when she sees she is listed on the Dead Pool as " Malia Hale " .
Malia is severely hurt and feels betrayed by Stiles keeping the information from her , straining her relationship with him .
Malia meets with Peter , learning from him her real mother is known as ' the Desert Wolf ' .
Malia does n't see herself as different from Peter , he being a killer while she killed her adoptive mother and sister .
In " Monstrous " after being almost killed and learning of Stiles ' own near - death experience , Malia , with a push from Melissa , ultimately makes up with him , and at the Martin lakehouse they locate the computer servers that house the Dead Pool , and shut them down .
On the mission to rescue Scott and Kira , Peter tries to coax Malia into unleashing her animal side in the fight against Kate and the Berserkers , but Malia sees Peter for the monster he truly is upon learning he was intending to murder Scott .

Unfortunately , Tracy is euthanized by the Dread Doctors at that moment to her horror .
Malia soon grows to trust the newcomer Theo Raeken .

Overwhelmed , she confesses she ca n't pull off her suicide by herself and asks Argent to help her .
Together , they impale her upon a knife .
Victoria dies in Argent 's arms .
Victoria 's death causes Allison 's devastation and moral spiral at the end of Season 2 , but also Argent 's defection from the hunter 's cause .
Victoria 's attempt to murder Scott is unknown to Allison until Season 3 , as Scott did not want her actions to be Allison 's last memory of her mother .

In " Wolf 's Bane " , Harris is questioned by Sheriff Stilinski regarding the murderous events that take place during Season 1 after the Alpha werewolf tries to kill him .
Harris reveals that six years ago , he babbled to a woman on how to set a house on fire and make it look like it was not an act of arson after she got him drunk .
A few days after he gave this information , a house caught on fire and was burned down ( the Hale family mass murder ) .
The woman he gave information to is revealed to be Kate Argent .
In Season 2 , Harris is believed to be the Kanima 's Master , because his car was stolen by the Master and was identified to be at the presence of several of the murder sites .
He was proven innocent by Stiles and Scott .
During Season 3 , in episode " Unleashed " , it is revealed Harris was a former military officer and so he was sacrificed as a Warrior .
Before he was abducted from his classroom , he left behind a clue to the gang in his test papers allowing Deaton to identify the killer as a Darach .
He begged for his life , saying the Darach still needs him .
He knew who and also about this person 's motives , but the Darach kills him .
Later in " Currents " , Stiles uncovers Danny 's proposed telluric currents project for Harris along with a note to Danny directly from Harris to stay away from the subject .
This allows them to figure out the Darach 's abductions and sacrifices are aligned with the telluric currents around Beacon Hills , and that Harris was n't only sacrificed , he knew something .
It 's implied that eventually Harris ' body was found off - screen since Sheriff Stilinski had labeled him when he 's investigating possible supernatural explanations of some crimes .
colspan=5Alan Deaton is the veterinarian at the Beacon Hills Animal Clinic , the older brother of guidance counselor Marin Morrell , and Scott 's boss .

In Season 3 , Deaton has taken on a mentor - like figure to Scott and all his friends .
In the episode " Unleashed " , Stiles comes to him concerning a new killer committing Human Sacrifices , having linked the murders to the Druid order , and that he always seems to have more information than anyone else .
When Stiles demands why he 's always so cryptic and withdrawing , Deaton alludes to a dark past that presumably caused him to go into retirement when he answers that spending the past decade " trying to push something away " with the lies and the denial becomes a pretty habit .
When Lydia calls saying the music teacher has been taken for to be sacrificed
he helps Stiles and Lydia identify the new killer as a Darach .
He also identifies the pattern of the sacrifices of being groups of three offering the Darach its type of power - Virgins , Healers , Philosophers , Warriors .
It is discovered Marin is actually his younger sister , and that they are both Emissaries , Druid practitioners , that function as advisers to the werewolf Packs and ambassadors between them and humanity .
Deaton fulfilled this role for the Hale family , and was especially close to Derek 's mother , Talia Hale .
In " Alpha Pact " , he helps Scott , Stiles and Allison find their parents , by proposing they take a sacrificial Druid ritual in order to locate the Nemeton which will have consequences for them , leaving a " scar " around their hearts for the rest of their lives and being substitute Guardian sacrifices for the parents which will fully revitalize the Nemeton , subsequently attracting the supernatural to Beacon Hills like a magnet .
They decide to do it , to sacrifice themselves temporarily with someone to pull them back as a tether .

When it is revealed the Nogitsune is possessing Stiles , Deaton heads to Japan in " Letharia Vulpina " , to retrieve a sample of a plant called letharia vulpina that was born out of the blood of the very Nogitsune Argent
saw killed 24 years earlier , which makes the plant " quite special " .
Upon arriving back in Beacon Hills , he poisons Stiles with the plant which temporarily breaks the Nogitsune 's hold over Stiles .
After Scott retrieves the ShugendÅ scroll in " Echo House " , which has instructions on how to exorcise a Nogitsune , Deaton translates that the host 's body has to be changed .
In " The Divine Move " , Deaton confirms that the Hales ' triskele urn could imprison the Nogitsune because it was crafted by Deaton himself , out of wood of the Nemeton tree .
At Season 3B end , after Allison 's death , Deaton provides counsel for Scott with the fallacy " Regression to the Mean " , saying things will stop being all bad , or all good and always revert to a neutral space .
In Season 4 , Deaton sets out to learn what Kate did to Derek , causing him to revert to being a teenager , the subsequent loss of his werewolf abilities and what it means for him .
He visits an inmate at Eichen House 's prison for supernaturals , Gabriel Valack .
When Valack asks him why , Deaton answers he made a promise to a woman he loved ( Talia Hale ) that he would look after Derek .
Valack inflicts a psychic vision upon Deaton concerning La Iglesia .
Lydia snaps Deaton out of his vegetative state with a Scream .
Deaton tells the Pack the old Mexican church is where Scott and Kira will be found after they 're abducted by Kate .

Tracy , however , escapes through the barrier .
After Tracy is killed , Deaton stores her corpse in the clinic and studies her .
He reports to Scott Tracy had the claws of a werewolf but the venom and scales of a kanima .
He also realizes the werewolf mutant and Tracy could n't be supernatural , born or Bitten : they had to have been artificially made .
Deaton is shaken saying someone has blurred the lines between science and the supernatural , changing the rules .
He tells Scott he has to leave for a few days .
In " Ouroboros " , Deaton is in Russia , and discovers an old lair used by the Dread Doctors .
He takes a particular tooth out of a container calling it " an answer " .

The werecoyote takes him hostage across the borders .
In " The Sword and the Spirit " , Deaton is used as bait for a trap for Malia by the Desert Wolf .

Later , he stabilises Hayden 's mortal injuries after Sebastien wounds her .
In season 6A " Superposition " , Deaton examines the blue shard of glass from the sheriff 's impound as Scott tells him that pieces of his memory are missing .
Deaton suggests that Scott 's subconscious is trying to tell him what 's missing .
The easiest way to figure this out would be to sleep .
Later in the episode , as Lydia is tapping into her subconscious through automatic writing , Deaton explains how the Wild Hunt does n't just take people , it erases them from reality .

In 2006 , 9-year - old Matt had gone to Isaac Lahey 's house to trade superhero comic books with him .
The swim team of Beacon Hills High at that time was having a pool party at the house and drinking alcohol to celebrate their winning the state championship .
Matt was thrown into the pool by Camden , Isaac 's older brother , despite yelling that he ca n't swim , resulting in him almost drowning .
He was resuscitated by Coach Lahey who berates him about not knowing how to swim and demands
he tell no one what happened .
Matt obliged keeping the incident secret for years , causing himself trauma and having irregular nightmares where he 's drowning .
Back during the Argents ' funeral , when he was photographing Allison , Lahey had got in one of his shots .
Matt'd felt an unbelievable rage for his near - drowning years earlier and wished that Lahey was dead .
The following morning he found out Lahey was dead .
In " Shape - Shifted " he 'd spied on Jackson using his camera and witnessed his transformation into the Kanima .
He and the Kanima touched hands seemingly by instinct .

He needed answers as to why he was beginning to transform into the Kanima , but Derek silently realized Matt had broken the rules of the Kanima .
The Master is to use the Kanima to kill murderers , while Matt had him kill innocent people and he had killed people himself .
The hunters attack the building and in the struggle between the Argents , Jackson , and Scott and Derek , Matt escapes but Gerard kills him by drowning him , using this opportunity to become the Kanima 's new Master .
As a result of his childhood trauma , Matt became a teenage killer , psychologically unstable , dangerous .
He irrationally called Lahey and the swim team murderers saying they ' murdered ' him .
He was also a stalker , relentlessly pursuing Allison by taking photos of her and photo shopping himself into these pictures depicting they were in a relationship .
As Master of the Kanima , Matt gained abilities to control the Kanima through a supernatural bond .
He could communicate with Jackson telepathically , control him also as a human , sense him from a distance and speak through him .
The bond between Master and Kanima was affected akin to Matt 's personality ; Jackson , as the Kanima would share his fear of water , and his affinity for photography : to target a victim , Matt just had to take their picture or think about killing them , then Jackson would kill them .

During Season 3 , Gerard is shown to be alive , in hiding and living at a medical home .
His cancer has now vanished , but is confined to a wheelchair and is consistently suffering the effects of the rejected Bite , black liquid still pouring out of his orifices .
He reveals to Argent that one of their family members in 1977 , Alexander Argent , his brother , was bitten by the Alpha werewolf , Deucalion .
In " Visionary " , Allison and Scott come to him for information about Deucalion 's Alpha pack in exchange for Scott siphoning some of his pain .
Gerard lies to them about Deucalion ambushing him and killing his men when they met with Deucalion 's pack during Deucalion 's proposed peace offering , when it was actually Gerard himself who ambushed all involved parties , killing Deucalion 's Pack members and killing his own men because they wanted peace with the Packs ( which Scott catches onto ) .
He 'd also stabbed Deucalion in the eyes with two arrows which caused Deucalion 's blindness .
Gerard 's treachery is what caused Deucalion to become the sociopath he is in the present , and lead to the Alpha Pack being formed .
However , he truthfully tells them that while Deucalion is blind , he can actually see in his werewolf form .
Scott threatens Gerard ; if he finds out that the story he told them about how Deucalion truly lost his eyesight was a lie , and people get hurt , he will return to " take away more than ( Gerard 's ) pain " .
In Season 5B " Damnatio Memoriae " , Gerard , still hospitalized , is visited by Argent .
Argent reluctantly produces yellow monkshood to Gerard 's surprise .
The older man eats the plant 's flowers voraciously : he is fully healed of his ailment .
Argent tells his father he knows he 's kept eyes and ears open .
Gerard responds that he knows of the Dread Doctors ' success .
The creature is a resurrected monster whose only purpose was to just take life wherever it could find it and is also personally connected to their family : the Beast of GÃ©vaudan .
In " The Sword and the Spirit " , Gerard reveals himself alongside Argent to a stumped Scott , but the meeting is cut short by the sight of the Dread Doctors ' terrifying fresco depicting the Beast fighting a creature Gerard identifies as a hellhound , a guardian of supernatural places - amongst bodies littering Beacon Hills .
Gerard and Argent then visit Parrish : Gerard informs and confirms Parrish 's supernatural species as a hellhound .
In " The Maid of GÃ©vaudan " , Gerard tells Lydia and Argent the story of their ancestor , Marie - Jeanne Valet who 'd slain the original Beast - her own brother , Sebastien Valet .
In particular Gerard references the weapon she used to kill Sebastien , the only thing capable of totally killing the Beast , is the mystical Pike she and her husband forged , and that Marie - Jeanne became the first hunter in the Argent family line : that his family name will be remembered once more .
He , Argent and Parrish track the Beast just as the monster has killed the Dread Doctors and completely revived as Sebastien Valet .
Gerard calls out to Sebastien as " La BÃªte du GÃ©vaudan " and demands Sebastien to answer him by his name .
Sebastien answers Gerard from afar :
" Argent " .
In " Apotheosis " , Gerard and Argent recover the Pike ( re - forged into the cane used by the Surgeon ) , and Gerard affirmatively answers that the cane will kill the Beast for sure .
Parrish takes on the Beast at spear - point , Gerard readies to kill the ancient werewolf at spear point , ready to strike once both the werewolf and the hellhound
are weak enough .
Gerard puts a bullet into Deucalion , discovering the alliance between him and Scott to his surprise , holding him and Liam at gun point , but Argent double crosses his father passing the Pike to Scott .
He and Scott had known Gerard would eventually stab them all in the back , regardless of how many people would perish and in the end , Gerard 's only care would be about immortalizing his own name .
Father and son hold each other at gun point : Gerard is shot by Argent .
In the end , Gerard snarls at an unapologetic Argent , who departs once again .

She asks Deaton is he going to inform them " what 's coming " .
At the end of Season 2 , she convinces Deaton to get more involved in the supernatural circle of Beacon Hills and the two start tracking Gerard after his plan fails .

She is actually Deaton 's younger sister and they are both practitioner druids called Emissaries that act as advisers to werewolf Packs , liaisons between them and humanity
and she supposedly fulfills this role for the Alpha Pack .
Marin was originally the Emissary for Deucalion 's original Pack and was the only one spared when the Alphas killed off their Packs .
In the episode " The Girl Who Knew Too Much " , Scott confronts her asking her what Deucalion wants with him .
Marin replies he wants to make a killer out of him , because if Scott kills someone he 'll destroy his potential to be a True Alpha or have Scott join his Pack , either way Scott is eliminated as a threat to Deucalion .
In " Alpha Pact " , after the Darach is revealed to be Jennifer Blake , she is seen fleeing from the Alphas in the woods but protects herself with a mountain ash circle .
They had suspected her to have had a role to play with the Darach .
Marin confronts Deucalion over his ruthlessness in his goal to form his ' perfect pack ' , that she 'd begun to try and stop him .
Kali tells her they know she sent the mystery woman to save Isaac and had begun helping Scott and his friends find a way to stop Deucalion .
Marin reveals the woman 's name was Braeden , that she 'd sent Braeden to do what Marin herself does , " maintain balance " and reveals to the other Alphas that Deaton had actually saved Ennis , but Deucalion killed him and lied to them about it being Derek who 'd killed him .
She tries to tell Kali he intended for her to force Derek 's decision to join the Pack , because that paves the way for Deucalion 's plans for him and Scott .

Marin supplies Stiles with amphetamines to keep him awake as he needs to avoid sleeping when he 'll be most vulnerable to the Nogitsune possession .
Marin lets Stiles know if the burns disappear completely , the Nogitsune returns and Scott and Deaton have n't found a cure by then
, she will kill him by lethal injection to do what she does : " maintain the balance " .

Boyd felt terrible guilt over not watching his sister .
In Season 2 , he is first seen in episode " Ice Pick " .
Boyd becomes the third member of Derek 's pack , completing the basic requirement for an actual werewolf pack .
He joined so he would n't have to be the high school loner anymore .
For most of the season , he was Derek 's right - hand man and physically the strongest Beta werewolf of the pack .
Derek treated Boyd distinctly differently from the way he treated Isaac and Erica .
Isaac and Erica were sent in like attack dogs , while Derek held Boyd in reserve , as he was more mature and stronger than them .
In " Party Guessed " , he experiences his first full moon as a werewolf ; he goes feral and almost gets loose but is subdued by a more successful Isaac .

Erica tried to fight back against the Alphas , but was killed .
Boyd and Cora , Derek 's younger sister who was also captured , were refrained from fully transforming during the full moons , by the hecatolite lined in the bank vault keeping the full moon from reaching them .
This caused their rage and bloodlust to build up inside for months .

Upon being found by Derek and Scott , both of them lost all control and escaped into the woods to kill whomever they came across .
They were later subdued by Derek , with assistance from Scott , Isaac and Argent .

During Derek 's fight with Kali , Boyd is held captive by Kali and she has the twins Ethan and Aiden hold Derek 's claws upward .
Kali then kills Boyd by impaling him upon Derek 's claws , causing the latter to absorb Boyd 's powers and see his memory of Erica 's death , which shatters him .
Dying , Boyd comforts Derek by telling him to not blame himself and that the sensation of the full moon was worth everything .

The twins were originally members of a Pack of infamously brutal werewolves and their Alpha having been the worst .
The twins were constantly mistreated , abused by all the others ; Ethan admitted to them being something like " the bitches " of the Pack .
After meeting Deucalion , he taught them how to harness a form where they could Merge .
Once they mastered the skill they proceeded to eliminate each member of the pack , eventually both becoming Alpha werewolves themselves after killing their Alpha together .
Out of fealty , and perhaps fear , they joined Deucalion 's Alpha pack .
Enrolling at Beacon Hills High in Season 3A , they repeatedly antagonize Isaac and Scott .
Ethan is gay and begins pursuing Danny Mahealani , while Aiden begins a liaison with Lydia .
Ethan and Aiden initially seduced Danny and Lydia respectively to try to get leverage and information on Scott and his allies , but Ethan 's feelings for Danny eventually turn genuine .
Aiden insists that his feelings for Lydia are fabricated , though they in fact run deeper than he would like to admit .
Ethan 's relationship with Danny softens the Alpha to the point where he meets Scott halfway in the episode " Currents " explaining
he wo n't harm Danny , as he realizes that Danny is n't part of Scott 's group but now knows that Lydia is .
When the Alphas have Derek kill Boyd by hand as per Kali 's order , Ethan shows guilt for his actions , which Scott catches onto .
Having Lydia distract Aiden , Scott and Stiles confront Ethan for conformation concerning whether or not the Darach could have been an emissary to any one of them in " The Girl Who Knew Too Much " .

Fortunately , Lydia and Cora get them to Deaton , who helps save their lives .
In Season 3B , they 've lost their Alpha status and their talent to merge into their super - werewolf form in their feat to survive Jennifer 's attack , so they disappear for a couple of weeks , with Ethan breaking up with Danny , though Lydia keeps in contact with Aiden .
In " Galvanize " , they say they need to join a new Pack as they are now Omegas and enemies will come for them because of their time with Deucalion .
They come to ask Scott to join his Pack .
Isaac and Stiles are vehemently against this and Scott says no as they do n't trust them , particularly because of their part in Boyd 's murder .
Later , they decide to re - enroll in high school .
Aiden continues his affair with Lydia but she eventually states that she helps to save lives , while all she sees is how he helped kill Boyd saying he 's a ' bad guy ' not just a ' bad boy ' .
Aiden shows genuine guilt for this .
Ethan , meanwhile catches Danny making out with his ex - boyfriend and appears hurt .
To make a fresh start and earn Scott 's trust the twins help out with threats such as finding the serial killer William Barrow , combating the Oni , where they are both " tagged " by the said demons and helping out with the chaos caused by Stiles under the Nogitsune 's possession .

Bleeding heavily and dying , Aiden is held in Derek 's arms while Ethan cries over him .
Aiden tearfully states that Lydia will have a hard time thinking he became a ' good guy ' , but Derek reassures
he will tell her himself .
After passing away , Aiden 's death is " felt " by Lydia , which deeply saddens her .
With the loss of his brother , Ethan decides to leave Beacon Hills .
Danny breaks up with him instead and reveals that he knows Ethan is a werewolf , which shocks the latter .
He then gives Ethan a kiss goodbye .
Ethan and Aiden had a talent to sense when the other is in pain and the power to physically merge their bodies into a single more powerful werewolf form .
However , when Jennifer Blake killed their " super - wolf " form , their feat to survive as individuals cost them their Alpha status and that ability .
Personality - wise , Ethan is calm , reserved , calculating , passive and shows remorse for his actions , as while Aiden was impulsive , aggressive , cocky , spontaneous and prone to violence .
Both twins have a sense of honor as they followed Deucalion after he helped them fight back against their abusers in their original pack , and they both show guilt for their actions against Scott 's fellowship .
colspan=5Jennifer Blake was the English teacher at Beacon Hills High School .
Jennifer was the Darach .
In " Tattoo " , Jennifer starts her class with the last quote from Joseph Conrad 's " Heart of Darkness " .
Suddenly , flocks of birds mysteriously come flying through the window and begin attacking the class .
She is seen mildly distressed afterward .
In " Fireflies " , Jennifer is seen late at school grading papers , when she happens across a feral Boyd and Cora .
She is saved by Derek who endures their attacks until the sun rises .
Derek helps her up and she supposedly takes a liking to him .
She sees Derek again in " Unleashed " , where she says she 'll say nothing about what she saw .
Derek says he was going to see if she was okay
and they connect .
When Derek comes to her for help , after being wounded by Deucalion 's Alpha pack , she takes him to his loft in " Motel California " and tries to help him heal .
Jennifer and Derek connect again with him saying she should n't get involved with him , because everyone around him gets hurt , but she says she 's been hurt before .
They share a kiss and spend the night together , which helps Derek heal faster .
When the Alphas attack his loft in " Currents " , Kali has the twins hold her hostage as leverage against Derek and she witnesses Derek , in his Alpha werewolf form , and Kali fight .
She is saved by Isaac but Kali has Derek kill Boyd .
In the episode " The Girl Who Knew Too Much " , Jennifer is taking a class and sees Lydia drawing a tree .
Later , she organizes the recital to honor the dead .
Sheriff Stilinski simultaneously uncovers an old case about a patient who was brought to Beacon Hills Memorial years ago , but birds , similarly to the events in " Tattoo " died that day with Stilinski realizing the birds were sacrificing themselves for the girl - who he figures out to actually be Jennifer .
Jennifer is revealed to be the Darach , the dark druid responsible for the mass sacrifices in Beacon Hills , tries to kill Lydia and kidnaps Stilinski .
Using mistletoe Scott and Stiles prove to Derek she is the Darach in " The Overlooked " , by exposing her true form .
Derek angrily attacks her , but she reveals she 's poisoned his sister Cora with the same plant and only she can heal her .
As the Alpha pack try to kill her , she shows her intense hatred for them .
She reveals to Derek her first name was Julia Baccari
and she was Kali 's Emissary .
She and Kali were close , but Kali had attempted to kill her , as part of killing her entire Pack in order to join the Alpha pack .
She was able to survive because Kali could n't bring herself to deliver the final blow .
Julia then struggled to the Nemeton , which had n't had power for a long time .
But the sacrifice of a virgin months earlier had given the tree stump a spark of power again , which gave Julia the ability to survive just long enough until help arrived .
Eventually , because Kali 's attack had left Julia hideously disfigured , she used her talents to disguise herself with a new identity , ' Jennifer Blake ' .
She informs him of her plan to destroy Deucalion 's Alpha Pack on the next full moon which is also a lunar eclipse because werewolves lose all their power during the eclipse .
Derek affirms this .
She also tells him the virgin sacrificed at the Nemeton that reignited its power was Paige Krasikeva , his first love when Derek mercy - killed her , explaining her felt connection towards him .
In " Alpha Pact " , Jennifer holds Stiles ' father , along with Scott 's mother and Allison 's father for the final sacrifice , Guardians , as they are all Guardians of their children .
The behavior of the animals throughout the season is later discovered to have been caused by Jennifer in response to her and her mass sacrifices .
She is also discovered to be aligned with the telluric currents as she committed her sacrifices in line with them .
She 's holding the captive parents at the Nemeton , the same tree in Lydia 's been consistently drawing which is why Jennifer tried to kill her .
In " Lunar Ellipse " , Jennifer appears at Derek 's loft , breaking through the glass roof and takes on the Alpha Pack .
She overpowers Kali and the twins .
She angrily faces Kali , asking her what it takes for to look normal to spite Kali as she 'd physically ruined her actual face .
Jennifer demonstrates her power using telekinesis to have the glass shards rise and suspend .
Kali stubbornly rages at her former friend and Jennifer ferociously rockets the glass shards into Kali 's body , killing her former Alpha .
The twins then take her on in their merged form but she snaps their neck inducing them into a coma .
She uses Lydia to lure Derek back to his loft .
She promises Derek the kidnapped parents if he will be her " Guardian " , even after he informs her he 's no longer an Alpha werewolf .
Jennifer begins sacrificing the parents using the storm to bury them alive with her connection to the telluric currents .
At the abandoned distillery outside of Beacon Hills , they face off against Deucalion who has Scott with him .
Deucalion easily overpowers both of them , but , to buy more time , Scott blinds the " Demon Wolf " long enough for the lunar eclipse to arrive and the werewolves are rendered powerless .
Jennifer assumes her true form and thrashes Deucalion .
Derek convinces her to heal his blindness so he can see the results of his actions on her with the intent of him repenting her .
However , this leaves Jennifer weakened as Derek had intended .
Enraged , Jennifer repeatedly assaults Derek , but he endures her attacks just long enough for the lunar eclipse to pass .
The lunar eclipse passes , but Jennifer protects herself with a mountain ash barrier , now fully intent on sacrificing the parents .
To save them , Scott determinedly pushes through her barrier and eventually breaks it becoming a True Alpha .
Scott says he 'll kill her himself if she does n't stop the storm , but Deucalion does it mortally wounding her .
Jennifer survived Deucalion 's slash to the throat , and was hoping the Nemeton would restore her health once more only to be stopped by Peter Hale .
After revealing she knows all about his plan ( killing Scott to steal his new Alpha status ) , Peter slashes her throat himself , killing her for good .
Jennifer was highly intelligent , specializing in literature and mythology , as expected of a druid Emissary .
She had an intense hatred for Deucalion 's Alpha pack , specifically Kali as she was friends with her and Kali tried to kill her and she stopped at nothing to get revenge on them , to the point of sacrificing innocent people .
As the Darach , Jennifer was amongst the most powerful beings seen in the series because of her mass druid sacrifices .
By massacring Warriors , she gained enhanced strength , Healers for healing abilities so great she healed Deucalion 's eyesight , Philosophers for intelligence and strategy , and Virgins , to seduce people easily for her agenda as with Derek .
She could use telekinesis , a form of mind control to have a pianist killed by a split random cord off the piano to slit her throat for her final Philosopher sacrifice , she could appear somewhere else partially or teleport completely as seen when Lydia saw her materialize in a blaze in " Motel California " and when she abducted victims .
Overall , her most impressive ability was glamoring herself to hide in plain sight
so efficiently she settled into her " Jennifer Blake " persona for the majority of the time fooling many people
she was a harmless , innocent woman .
colspan=5Cora Hale is Laura and Derek 's younger sister and also a born werewolf .
She unknowingly survived the Hale House fire and was apparently unaware her siblings
Laura and Derek were away at school at the time .
Cora was long believed by Derek and Laura to be dead .
After the fire , Cora ventured to South America where she lived during the intervening years .
She believed her entire family was dead , but she came into town after hearing rumors an Alpha werewolf was building a Pack back in Beacon Hills , California , " one of the Hales " .
After Boyd and Erica were captured by the Alpha Pack , Cora was captured also and learned her brother Derek was alive .
All three were held captive in the abandoned Beacon Hills First National Bank .
During this period , Erica tried to fight back , but was killed by the Alpha werewolf Kali .
Cora became friends with Boyd during their imprisonment , but the hecatolite lined in the bank vault refracted the moonlight , refraining the two werewolves from fully transforming during the full moons , causing their rage and bloodlust to build up inside .
Three months later , upon being found by Derek and Scott , Cora and Boyd lost all control of their animal sides and escaped into the woods to kill .
They were later subdued by Derek , with assistance from Scott , Isaac and Argent .
Eventually the sun rises and she and Boyd are rescued and Cora is reunited with her brother joining his Pack .
Cora is impulsive , trigger - happy , short tempered , vengeful and tomboyish but she cares for those close to her .
Like her older brother Derek , she gives death threats to people ; of course , like her older brother , she has no intention of going through with them .
In " Currents " , when Deaton is kidnapped to be sacrificed by the Darach , Cora helps Scott 's friends to find him deducing that Deaton is being held in the same bank she was locked in for three months , but she learns the Alphas have attacked Derek 's loft and sabotaged the trap for them .
Cora leaves with Stiles and Lydia to help her brother .
After Boyd is killed by the Alphas , she breaks down in tears and cradles her close friend 's body .
Cora tries to avenge his death by killing Aiden , but fails to do so and is knocked out when Aiden strikes her in the head with a weight .
She is saved by Scott and Ethan when they restrain Aiden .
Her wound from the blow to her head Aiden gave her suddenly does n't heal , she falls unconscious and is put in the hospital .
She was later revealed to have also been poisoned by Jennifer with mistletoe for leverage against Derek .
Derek saves her life by giving up his Alpha werewolf status using his pain transference to heal her .
In the mid - season 3 finale , Cora helps Lydia and Deaton save the lives of Aiden and Ethan after their defection from the Alpha Pack .
She later leaves Beacon Hills with Derek for her former residence in South America .
During Season 3B , Cora goes into hiding at Derek 's request , remaining in South America as he undertakes a mission to retrieve their mother Talia 's claws from the Calavera hunters and they separate .

She comes up to Allison and Lydia asking for Scott .
Unfortunately the twins spot her .
She bruises the two girls ' arms .
The Alphas corner her
and she manages to put up a good fight against the Pack , but is ultimately knocked down after sustaining wounds from them .
Braeden lets
Deucalion know she knows he 's afraid of Scott , of ' the man he 'll become ' .
The Alpha pack leader informs her
he 's aware
Scott 's a potential threat , but he intends to place Derek and Scott against each other to eliminate " the threat " and slashes Braeden .
Braden 's actions are revealed in the episodes " Chaos Rising " , that the bruises she left on Allison and Lydia form the logo for the abandoned Beacon Hills First National Bank where the Alpha pack is holding Boyd and Cora hostage and " Currents " , that her words regarding Scott was that he had the potential to be a True Alpha and was intending to warn him about the Alpha Pack and Deucalion 's plan for him .
Her identity remained unknown until " Alpha Pact " when the Alpha Pack confront Marin Morrell that she sent her in a move against them .
Morrell reveals she sent Braeden to rescue Isaac from the Alphas , to ensure balance .
In " More Bad Than Good " , it is discovered Braeden is actually alive , but scarred on her face and neck from Deucalion 's claws .
She rescues Derek and Peter from the Calavera werewolf hunters and helps them retrieve the triskele urn in the hunters ' possession .
She reveals she was hired by Deucalion to save them .
While Braeden is shown to be fearless , spontaneous and altruistic , it is explained she is a mercenary for hire , taking dangerous jobs from anyone who can pay her , regardless of her client 's intentions or identity , or the moral compunctions of her missions .
Braeden appears in " The Dark Moon " in Season 4 , being provided by Araya Calavera as a guide to Scott 's Pack during their mission in Mexico to find Derek .
She 's taken a contract from the Calaveras to find Kate , capture her and return her to them .

Braeden staggers into the house and knocks Corrine unconscious finally capturing the Desert Wolf .
colspan=5Deucalion is an Alpha werewolf , formerly the Alpha Pack leader .
In the past , Deucalion was the leader of his Pack and his Emissary was Marin Morrell .
Deucalion had come to Beacon Hills for a meeting to discuss the threat of the Argent werewolf - hunter family .
Fellow Alpha Ennis wanted help to combat the Argents because they had killed one of his Beta werewolves .
Deucalion reasoned saying they killed his Beta because he killed two of theirs .
Ennis declared revenge , anyway .
Deucalion wanted to avoid bloodshed to make peace with the Argents .
He met with Alpha werewolf Talia Hale and her Emissary , Deaton , to seek their advice before meeting with Gerard Argent .
He and three of his Betas were instead tricked and ambushed by Gerard , who not only killed Deucalion 's Betas , but his men who wished for peace with the Packs .
He later blinded Deucalion in an unsuccessful attempt to kill him .
With the help of Deaton , Deucalion 's eyes healed physically , but his sight did n't return .
This discovery coupled with Gerard 's betrayal enraged Deucalion .
Marco , another of his beta werewolves , took this opportunity to try and kill Deucalion to become the Alpha of their pack .
Deucalion , however , realized he could see using his werewolf vision and savagely killed Marco in retaliation .
In doing so he realized Alphas became stronger when they kill their own Betas .
The entire experience corrupted Deucalion .
Eventually , he killed the rest of his pack to add all of their powers to his own and lead fellow Alphas Kali and Ennis to do the same .
Sometime after , he came across the twins ( Aiden and Ethan ) who were " the bitches " in a brutal Pack .
Deucalion taught them how to control their merged form to fight back against their abusers and they joined him after killing their original Alpha .
He pulled all five of them together to form an Alpha pack .
He even had all the members kill their Emissaries , except for Marin , his own .
Deucalion eventually came to be known as " the Demon Wolf " .
Deucalion 's Alpha Pack arrived in Beacon Hills in the Season 2 finale , capturing Boyd and Erica in the process .
In " Unleashed " , Deucalion goes to Derek 's loft along with Kali and Ennis to offer Derek a proposition for Derek to kill his own Pack to join his own with the intention of recruiting him .
Deucalion 's actual plan for Derek was to place him against Scott .
To this end , after the battle between the Packs in " Frayed " , Deucalion kills Ennis after he fails to heal himself , absorbing Ennis ' power ; he lies to Kali and the twins that Ennis died of his wounds , intending to have a vengeful , distraught Kali force Derek 's decision to join the Alpha Pack .
In " Currents " , the reason for this is because Deucalion knows that Scott has the potential to become a True Alpha and wants to recruit Scott , not Derek .
Deucalion 's true intentions throughout Season 3 were to push Scott into a position to either join the Alpha Pack or have Scott kill somebody , destroying his True Alpha potential and eliminating Scott as a potential threat to him .
He had Ethan and Aiden enroll in high school to seduce people close to Scott for leverage .
When the new killer committing human sacrifices is revealed to be a Darach , Deucalion had his pack hunt it down .
He targets the Darach because it used to be a druid who can call upon powers from sacrifices .
After finding out that the Darach is Jennifer , Kali 's old emissary , the Alpha Pack leader tried to have her killed .
Scott later tearfully joins Deucalion 's pack in " The Overlooked " in return for Deucalion 's offer to help look for his kidnapped mother .
In " Alpha Pact " , he tries to have Marin killed when he suspects her to have had a role with the human sacrifices and she confirms to have had been working against him to " maintain balance " , but Scott ultimately saves her .
In " Lunar Ellipse " , Deucalion and Scott face off against Jennifer and Derek ( who Jennifer forced into helping him ) .
Deucalion shifts into his Demon Wolf persona and overpowers both of them easily .
He then tries to force Scott into killing Jennifer to become an Alpha , but Scott blinds him using flash bolts as he can see as a wolf .
During the lunar eclipse , Deucalion temporarily loses his powers and Jennifer is to be able to defeat him .
After being beaten to a pulp , Jennifer is tricked by Derek into healing Deucalion 's normal eyesight to allow him to see her face and the result of his crimes on her but Jennifer is weakened because of this .
After the lunar eclipse passes , Deucalion is in awe as Scott awakens his True Alpha abilities , breaking through Jennifer 's mountain ash barrier .
Deucalion saves Scott from becoming a killer by mortally wounding Jennifer , slashing her throat , subsequently stopping her from sacrificing the kidnapped parents .
Because of this , Derek and Scott decide to let Deucalion go , hoping he can be the man he once was before .
They warn him , if he commits something they do n't like , he 'll never see them coming .
In Season 3B episode , " More Bad than Good " , Braeden reveals Deucalion had hired her to rescue Derek from the Calavera werewolf hunters .
In Season 5 , " The Sword and the Spirit " , Deucalion has been tracked down and is held hostage by Theo 's Chimera Pack after some strife and pain on their part .
Deucalion is blind again saying Jennifer 's magically healing his eyesight was only temporary .
The Alpha tells Theo he 's aware of the Beast of GÃ©vaudan which has been resurrected by the Dread Doctors and that Theo wants the werewolf to show him how to steal its power .
In exchange , Deucalion says that he only wants Scott 's eyes " on the tips of ( his ) claws " .
In " Amplification " , Hayden is assigned to watch over Deucalion .
The Alpha offhandedly lets her know Theo plans on siphoning the Beast 's power using the garuda talons , but Theo 's own Chimera frequency would reject the talons then kill him .
He also gives her subtle advice on where her loyalties lie referring to the skirmish between Scott and Theo 's Packs , giving her the resolve to leave Theo so she can be with Liam .
In " The Beast of Beacon Hills " , Deucalion proposes that a ruffled Theo trust him while revealing he 'd has been playing them all along in that he 'd let them take him hostage .
Deucalion tells Theo the secret to stealing power is to " take their pain , take their life , take their power " which leads to Theo murdering Josh to siphon the latter 's power to use the Dread Doctor mask to identify the Beast .
He encourages Theo to align with Scott , saying he ca n't get to the Beast 's host â Mason â without Scott 's connection .
In " Apotheosis " , Deucalion is betrayed by Theo after the latter tests
his newfound Chimera abilities on him .
It is then revealed that Deucalion allied himself with Scott all along to double cross Theo and had lied to Theo about being both blind again ( using a mastery over his werewolf body to disguise his eyes ) , wanting to get back at Scott , and that Belasko 's talons could 've worked to siphon the Beast 's power .
Deucalion blinks with purpose and
his natural eye colour is back .
He then breaks Theo 's neck .
Deucalion presumably then leaves after Gerard is disabled by Argent , the Beast is killed and Theo is banished to the underworld .
Originally , Deucalion was described as a " man of vision " in the past , a level - headed , rational person as an Alpha , the leader of his Pack with a belief and faith in humanity .
He was changed by Gerard Argent 's treachery , the loss of his sight and his subsuming the powers of his Pack members by killing them .
As the Alpha Pack leader , Deucalion is obsessive , vain , charismatic , power - hungry , willing to kill anyone who gets in his way , not above killing members of his own if they are useless to him .
By Season 5 , Deucalion reforms , having helped Scott and his Pack against Theo and the Beast .
As the Alpha Pack leader , Deucalion possessed abilities greater than that of an average Alpha werewolf ; he was able to command a Pack of exceptionally powerful Alphas with both fear and respect .
Unlike most werewolves , in his transformed state , Deucalion 's skin turns dark blue / grey and his facial features appears more demonic than wolf - like .
colspan=5Kali was an Alpha werewolf and a member of Deucalion 's Alpha Pack .
Kali was one of the most dangerous werewolves and used the claws on her feet to fight in a martial arts form of combat .
Kali was Deucalion 's right hand in his Alpha pack , though Deucalion mentioned later , she joined so she could be with Ennis , hinting she and Ennis were involved with each other .
Kali was ruthless , arrogant , sadistic , cowardly and had no remorse for her actions ; like Deucalion and Ennis , Kali murdered her entire Pack to add all their power to hers , which she states felt " liberating " and she was responsible for the death of Erica .
After their pack 's battle with Derek 's Pack , Kali is shown to be worried over Ennis ' condition from his fight with Derek .
With Aiden and Morrell 's help , they get Ennis to Deaton 's clinic for treatment .
She is devastated when Deucalion reports that Ennis has died from his wounds ( in truth Deaton had actually saved Ennis , but Deucalion killed him to entice Kali into coming for Derek to further his plans for Derek and Scott ) .
Kali eventually fought Derek one - on - one at his loft , having Ethan and Aiden hold Derek 's girlfriend Jennifer Blake hostage and disabling the trap Boyd had set with the electrified water .
During the fight , Kali gets a hold of Boyd and has Derek inadvertently kill him so to have him absorb Boyd 's powers with an ultimatum : Derek has to join their pack by the full moon or she would kill him and all of his pack in repentance for Ennis ' death .
In the episode " The Overlooked " , when the Alpha pack began hunting the Darach which is actually Jennifer , it is revealed she is really Julia Baccari , Kali 's former Emissary .
When Deucalion confronted her , Kali admitted she 'd attempted to kill Julia , as part of killing her entire Pack in order to join the Alpha Pack , but she 'd loved Julia and was unable to do it in the end and left her to die .
Kali felt genuine remorse for this .
The Alphas attempted to kill Jennifer , but were foiled by Scott and his allies .
In the mid - season finale , she and Aiden show up at Derek 's loft to kill Derek , only to have their plans foiled by Ethan - who betrayed them .
Kali demands to know where Derek is .
Aiden is quick to join his brother after she threatens Lydia .
Kali confronts Aiden over his loyalties when he becomes violent in his supposed defection .
However , this turn of events is interrupted by Jennifer , who breaks into the loft through the glass roof .
Kali takes her on , but is overpowered .
Jennifer confronts Kali about her new glamoured form , asking her what it takes to be able to look normal to spite Kali as the malicious Alpha had ruined her real face when she 'd attempted to kill her .
Kali fires back saying she does n't care , but Jennifer responds saying " it takes power .
Power like this " , and uses telekinesis to levitate shards of the broken glass off the floor .
Kali shows fear at this display , but ultimately refused to back down in arrogance and screams she " should 've ripped
( Julia 's ) head off " , and Jennifer rockets the glass shards into Kali 's body , violently killing her .
colspan=5Ennis was an Alpha werewolf and part of Deucalion 's Alpha Pack .
In the past , one of Ennis ' Pack members accidentally killed two werewolf hunters and was killed in retaliation .
This enraged and saddened Ennis because he considered the Beta werewolf to be family to him .
This caused him to seek out a new member for his Pack .
He also came to Beacon Hills to seek out help combating the Argents meeting with delegations from other Packs including Deucalion , Kali and Talia Hale .
He was advised against it , but he declared revenge anyway igniting the conflict between the packs and the Argents that persisted to the present .
After being sought out and asked by Peter Hale , Ennis Bit Derek 's girlfriend Paige .
His intention was to be on good terms with Talia and to give his Pack a new member .
After changing his mind Derek tried to save Paige , but Ennis had already bitten her .
However , the Bite did n't take effect , her body rejecting the transformation , and Derek later killed her to end her suffering .
Sometime after that , Ennis killed his Emissary and his remaining Pack members to absorb their powers following Deucalion 's lead , along with Kali , and later on , with Ethan and Aiden , forming the Alpha Pack .
In the Season 3 premiere , " Tattoo " Ennis first appears disguised as a hospital orderly and tried to kidnap Isaac at the hospital , only to be stopped by Derek and Scott .
After breaking into Derek 's loft , Ennis easily subdued Cora while Deucalion explained his proposition to Derek about joining their pack .
During the Alpha pack 's battle against Derek 's pack in " Frayed " , Ennis was severely injured by Derek and Scott , which caused Kali and Aiden , along with their Emissary , Marin Morrell , to seek out Deaton for help .
Deaton saves his life , but Deucalion kills Ennis to absorb his powers after he could n't heal himself .
The Alpha pack leader lies to Kali and the twins that Ennis had actually died from his fight with Derek .
The Alpha pack declares that Derek must now either be killed or he is to join their Pack in repentance for Ennis ' death , as per their rules .
Marin tries to let the Alphas know Deucalion had actually killed Ennis intending to have Kali force Derek 's decision to further Deucalion 's plans for Derek and Scott , but he states she 's lying and Kali came for Derek anyway .
Ennis was the biggest member of the Alpha pack and a force of pure brutality .
His brute strength and fighting knowledge made him a deadly adversary in a fight .
He was arrogant , brutal and made rather zealous , amoral actions as an Alpha werewolf , declaring revenge on the Argents for their killing his dangerous Beta and Biting Paige .
He was also quite murderous , killing his entire Pack and Emissary to absorb all their power .
It 's shown that he and Kali were involved with each other and that he followed Deucalion which is why Kali joined , according to Deucalion .
colspan=5Rafael McCall is an FBI agent , Scott 's father , and Melissa 's ex - husband .
Rafael arrives in the episode " Alpha Pact " of Season 3 , investigating the murders by the Darach .
While it was implied now and then ( via Melissa 's response to Adrian Harris ' question regarding Scott 's relationship with his father in Season 1 , her asking Scott if his actions are in relation to his father during Season 2 , as well as Stiles ' negative reaction to the sight and questions of him during season 3 ) that Rafael is a jerk and deadbeat , he is shown sitting in Scott 's room with teary eyes , implying that whatever his flaws , Rafael cares about his son .
In the mid - Season 3 finale , Rafael insensitively reunites with Scott at Allison 's house .
He is seen trying to reconcile with Scott to no avail , which Melissa finds amusing .
During Season 3B , Rafael begins having Sheriff Stilinski 's cases forwarded to him .
As many of these are unclosed and unresolved ( due to the Sheriff 's new found knowledge of the supernatural ) , and inspecting Stilinski 's reopening of the Malia Tate case , he starts to have Stilinski impeached , which would have him fired , much to Scott and Melissa 's anger .
Stiles coldly lets Rafael know that his attitude towards his father is because of something else rather than his " professional disapproval " of Stilinski , something Rafael does n't like Stilinski knowing and
Stiles says he knows what it is .
When Stiles goes missing while sleepwalking in " Riddled " , Rafael picks up on a line from Stiles ' phone message to Scott and correctly deduces Stiles is sleepwalking , had called Scott while still asleep and is unknowingly at the werecoyote 's den .
Stilinski puts aside his differences with Rafael when he finds Stiles and brings him to the hospital , shaking his hand .
When Stilinski faces the impeachment case in " De - Void " , Rafael helps to talk him out of the case , revealing to him the real reason he came was to have an excuse to stay so he could talk to Scott .
In " Insatiable " , Rafael reveals to Scott why he left .
He used to drink heavily back when he and Melissa were still married .
One time , Rafael had come home drunk and was holding Scott when Scott was little .

colspan=5Noshiko Yukimura is Kira 's mother and Ken 's wife .
Noshiko is also a Kitsune of the type Celestial , and she is close to 900 years old .
Despite her supernatural status , Noshiko is a caring , domesticated and helpful mother to Kira and happily married to Ken .
She is a pragmatist , being stoic and forthcoming .
Noshiko serves as Kira 's mentor to harness her Kitsune powers , and due to her centuries ' long life , occasionally a source of guidance and knowledge .
Noshiko is first seen in " Galvanize " when Scott is invited over for a sushi dinner with the family after Scott and Kira develop an interest in each other .
Noshiko tells Scott some of their family history .
In " Riddled " , Noshiko unintentionally displays talents similar to Kira 's which Kira catches .
Noshiko later appears at the hospital during the power surge .
She faces off against the Nogitsune , who is possessing Stiles Stilinski , with two of the Oni by her side .
She and the Nogitsune trade words letting him know she will be undeterred in eliminating the Dark Kitsune , even if his chosen host is an innocent .
Later , Noshiko sees Kira manifest her Foxfire defusing a sabotaged electrical cable , subsequently leaving Kira all the more suspicious .
In " Letharia Vulpina " , Noshiko meets with Ken , where he hands her a fake book containing blades , unaware that Kira is spying on them .
It 's realized that Noshiko is who summoned the Oni to Beacon Hills .
The blades she carries , represent her Kitsune Tails .
By sacrificing a Tail , a respective Oni is summoned from the Nemeton , and she can command the demons .
Noshiko is adamant that Stiles be killed to eliminate the Nogitsune .
In " The Fox and the Wolf " , Scott and Kira object to her saying they want to save Stiles instead and implore her to call off the Oni .
Noshiko reveals her story to her daughter and Scott , that she is responsible for unleashing the Nogitsune , saying he " came from ( her ) " .
In 1943 , Noshiko was living in a " relocation camp " called Camp Oak Creek under Executive Order 9066 .
Noshiko would subtly improve the lives of the interned Japanese Americans by stealing food and supplies , all the while engaged in a clandestine romance with a field medic , Corporal Rhys .
During an outbreak of pneumonia , Noshiko and Rhys discovered that the camp 's army medics were selling medical supplies on the black market , resulting in several deaths in the camp .
Noshiko hastily told her fellow interns of her discovery , but this unintentionally incited a riot .
Rhys had attempted to defuse the chaos but was set aflame by a cocktail from an intern , Satomi , who Noshiko realized too late
was a Bitten werewolf , and he died in agony .
Eventually the officers opened fire and innocents were put down .
Noshiko was shot also , but survived with her body healing .
She learned the entire incident was going to be covered up .
Enraged the army medics were going to get away with mass murder , as well as distraught with Rhys ' death .
Out of injustice , Noshiko prayed for her ancestors to send a Nogitsune to punish those responsible for the massacre , intending for the Dark Kitsune to possess her , for her pain and misery to imbue him with power .
But a Kitsune can not be controlled .
So being a trickster , the Nogitsune possessed Rhys ' corpse instead .
He proceeded to slaughter not only the officers , but the interns at Eichen House when the inhabitants relocated there .
Realizing her great mistake , Noshiko eventually cornered the Nogitsune and , with some help from Satomi , slew him .
Noshiko had buried the fly from the corpse which embodied the Nogitsune 's very being underneath the Nemeton .
The Yukimuras had relocated to Beacon Hills because the ritual Allison , Stiles and Scott undertook released the Kitsune from its prison .
Later , Noshiko visits Rhys ' grave in Eichen House 's basement in " De - Void " .
It is revealed she had carved the kanji " self " into the board to signify that Rhys had died as himself , not as a monster when the Nogitsune possessed him .
The Nogitsune corners her and he steals her last Kitsune Tail from her .
In " Insatiable " , Noshiko and the Oni arrive at Camp Oak Creek to slay the Nogitsune .
She confronts Kira 's protesting that she thinks he could be taken alive , saying that she tried to save Rhys seventy years ago , saying Stiles is gone .
She admits that while she is indeed no longer the Fox because of the sacrifice of her Tails , her daughter is , but the Nogitsune is still her demon to bury .
Unfortunately , the Void Kitsune , takes control of the Oni using her final Tail and he turns the demons against the group and Allison is killed .
With the Oni taken from her control , Noshiko takes Stiles and Kira back to their home .
The stakes having been raised , Kira asks her mom if the Nogitsune could be trapped again .
Noshiko replies the Nemeton 's power is what trapped the Void kitsune .

Kira figures out the shuriken represents her first Kitsune Tail with her mother smiling in pride .

At home , Noshiko attempts to help her daughter regain control of her power using acupuncture .
Unfortunately , she and Ken later see that Kira has involuntarily escaped into the night , and then that Kira 's sword was found embedded in a deceased Chimera .
Noshiko , enlightened , helps a frustrated Kira to read Valack 's coded novel which uncovers suppressed memories .
The elder kitsune advises Kira she ca n't read the novel because the story is confusing her Fox spirit .
To solve this issue , Kira should read the book , but without following the story : read the book backwards .
Kira succeeds , remembering the Dread Doctors experimented on her the night of the traffic jam .
Kira and Noshiko leave Beacon Hills for answers so to tame her daughter 's Fox spirit .
In Season 5B , " Codominance " Noshiko and Kira are in Shiprock , New Mexico .
They track down a trio of skinwalkers .
Noshiko tells Kira they may have a solution for taming her Fox spirit if she passes their test , but the alternative would be Kira staying with them and become a skinwalker herself .
Kira is appalled at her mother for even considering the option .
Noshiko placates her daughter , saying if the Fox becomes too powerful it will consume Kira and there 'll be nothing of her left , but if she becomes a skinwalker her daughter would be kept alive .
Kira despondently asks her mom would she really leave her there .
Noshiko is conflicted after this .
After Kira destroys the Oni manifestation as the test , but the shifters declare Kira must stay with them , Noshiko changes her mind .
The elder kitsune firmly tells the skinwalkers if they want her daughter " they 'll have to go through ( her ) " .
Scott and Stiles arrive at that moment and help them escape .
Noshiko is surprised but smiles upon hearing Kira tell Scott she loves him .

colspan=5"The Nogitsune " ( éç ) is a Void , or Dark , Kitsune , a 1000-year - old spirit .
The Nogitsune possessed Stiles Stilinski , causing a string of chaos throughout Beacon Hills .
He is a trickster that feeds on pain , tragedy , chaos and the like .
Stiles was vulnerable to Nogitsune 's control as the sacrificial ritual Stiles took , along with Scott and Allison , had left a door to his mind ajar .
This Void kitsune was the reason the demon entities known as the Oni were summoned to Beacon Hills by the 900-year - old Kitsune Noshiko Yukimura ; to search for the Nogitsune and kill him .

In the episode , " The Fox and the Wolf " , it is revealed Noshiko Yukimura had summoned the Nogitsune in the first place back in 1943 .
Noshiko had wanted him to possess her to seek vengeance upon the corrupt army medics that had caused a manslaughter at Camp Oak Creek , by selling medical supplies for her fellow interns on the black market and the death of her lover Corporal Rhys .
She wanted her pain and tragic experience to imbue the Void Kitsune spirit with power .
Only the trickster , once it was unleashed from Noshiko 's prayers to her ancestors , he instead possessed the bandaged corpse of Rhys because a Kitsune can not be controlled .
The Nogitsune had unleashed his horror causing a bloodbath at the Eichen House institution where the interns had been relocated which Noshiko had never intended to happen .
She eventually cornered him and with some help from her werewolf friend , Satomi , slew the Nogitsune .
But because the Void Kitsune could not be killed , his very essence , embodied in the form of a fly , left Rhys ' corpse , was captured by Noshiko and buried beneath the magical tree , the Nemeton , just outside Beacon Hills .
He laid there dormant for the next seventy years , but the sacrifice undertaken by Stiles , Scott and Allison had released him from his prison .
The Nogitsune corners Noshiko Yukimura in the basement of Eichen House in " De - Void " where he steals Noshiko 's last Kitsune Tail from her , her last remaining kaiken and cuts open Stiles ' stomach which releases a stream of flies from Stiles ' body .

In the Season 3 finale episode " The Divine Move " , the Nogitsune , with the Oni still under his control , enters the final stages of his plan of destruction by unleashing the demons all over Beacon Hills ; with each person dying as a result of being cut by their blades .

When Scott , Kira , Stiles , and Lydia face off against the Nogitsune at the school , the Dark Kitsune informs them that the only way to stop the chaos is for Scott to kill Stiles ( comparing the young Alpha and his best friend respectively to a kaishakunin and a samurai ) in a Seppuku ritual .
When Stiles feels he has no other choice , he grabs Kira 's dropped katana and starts to kill himself to end the strife , but then figures out that everything that is happening around him and his friends is an illusion , which they break .
The Nogitsune , angered that his " game " has been ruined by the destruction of the Oni and by Stiles ' divine move , attempts to kill his host .
He advances on Stiles and Lydia raging , " I 'm a 1000 years old !
You ca n't kill me ! "
Stiles and Lydia tell the Kitsune they can change him instead by changing the body of his host 's copy .
Stiles tells his foe he " ca n't be a Fox and a Wolf
" moments before Scott Bites him , turning him and Kira stabs him with her sword .

Meredith recalls being able to communicate with a kidnapped Lydia over an immense distance .
Meredith had received a message that Lydia does not want them to look for her .
She listens to a phone , and says " Coup de Foudre " .
Scott translates her message as French for " Love at first sight " , the phrase Noshiko Yukimura had taught her lover Corporal Rhys at Camp Oak Creek in 1943 : Lydia is at Camp Oak Creek .
Meredith is then presumably returned to Eichen House .
In Season 4 , Lydia and Malia decide they need help from Meredith in " I.E.D. " to decode the rest of the Dead Pool .
Meredith heads to the high school , but is brought to the sheriff 's station by Parrish , saying she 's looking for Lydia .
Lydia and Malia arrive and they ask her about what she knows .
Meredith is cryptic as always saying Lydia ' called her ' .
Parrish offers input that perhaps what she needs to tell Lydia may be a number to call .
Meredith affirms this reciting the number 2 - 4 - 3 - 6 .

Unfortunately , Meredith had apparently committed suicide by hanging herself out of fear for her life .
Her corpse is found by Brunski and Lydia and Stiles mourn her death .
In " Weaponized " , Lydia claims a box of Meredith 's possessions and finds a photo of Meredith standing in the study of the Martins ' lakehouse .

In " Monstrous " , Meredith is brought to the sheriff 's station .
Lydia implores Meredith
why would she launch the Dead Pool .
Meredith tells Lydia she only wanted " to help " and that she 'll only talk to Peter Hale .
When Peter arrives , he repeatedly tells Meredith they have never met .
Meredith says Peter does n't remember her .
Peter reacts to this , and performs a mind meld .
Through Meredith 's memories , it is revealed during her hospitalization from Lorraine 's experiment , Meredith was placed next to Peter when he was comatose from the Hale Fire for months .
The whole time , a catatonic Meredith could involuntarily hear Peter 's thoughts telepathically : Peter was ranting due his trauma from the fire , raving over how he 'd predicted the Argents would target his family .
Meredith was terrorized by Peter 's cognizant revenge - fueled thoughts that he would remake the supernatural population of Beacon Hills in his image instead of his sister Talia 's .
To do this , Peter said first he 'd hire assassins to purge Beacon Hills of all supernaturals , placing them all on a hit list , " The Dead Pool " .
Peter was originally the one who planned the Dead Pool , though he did n't remember ; Meredith , using Lorraine 's computer code to comprise the Dead Pool , put the list online .
After Peter leaves , Lydia talks with Meredith afterward , showing her compassion for " someone who 'd put their name on a hit list .
"
Meredith justifies Peter 's ' plan ' in that the supernatural are monsters , even the banshees .
She believed too many people had died at their hands , and that she decided " to help " : she enacted the plan in response to her Hearing Lydia Scream as Allison died .
Lydia tells Meredith " not all monsters do monstrous things " , like Scott .
Meredith touches Lydia 's face and realizes , the latter is also an example .
The vulnerable banshee tears up , showing remorse , lamenting " What have I done ? "
In Season 5 , " Damnatio Memoriae " , Meredith communicates with a catatonic Lydia during the latter 's stint at Eichen House .
Meredith tells Lydia she has to wake up if she wants to save her friends .
Meredith reminds Lydia that she learned how to fight and promises to teach her the rest , how to use her voice as a weapon .
Within their telepathic communication , Meredith instructs Lydia to use her hands to guide her voice , to push it towards the target .
She traps Lydia in a cell to push her to break the glass .
Lydia asks Meredith to tell her how she learned .
Meredith immediately says Lydia has to find her own way .
She caves in to Lydia 's questions saying her way got people hurt .
Meredith was at school in chemistry class .
She was hearing people dying " everywhere " , she started slamming the desk so hard
and then Meredith Screamed .
All the windows shattered , the glass reverberated throughout the classroom , embedding into people 's arms , faces and their ears bled .
The event was blamed on an explosion caused by chemicals , but people knew it was her .
Meredith implores Lydia find " her own way " because her voice is like a bomb , she is too dangerous ; Lydia has to make hers " a bullet . "
When Malia is close to being killed by the Desert Wolf , Meredith yells at Lydia to break the glass , successfully coaxing Lydia to find her voice and snap her out of her catatonia .
When Scott 's Pack breaks into Eichen House to rescue Lydia , Scott finds Meredith also catatonic .

He binds them with restraints , and Lydia realizes the suicides committed were actually murders committed by him , including Lorraine and Meredith , and conclude that Brunski is ' the Benefactor ' .
Brunski bawls that some people are just beyond helping , and that he helps them , not by treatment , but by " releasing them " .

When the interns were relocated to Eichen House institution and the Nogitsune had brought his chaos to the institution resulting in a bloodbath , Satomi had survived and helped Noshiko defeat the Dark Kitsune .
In " Orphaned " , it is revealed that over the years Satomi had become an Alpha of a Pack : werewolves targeted by assassins in Beacon Hills , DeMarco Montana , Carrie Hudson and Brett Talbot were all Betas of this Pack .
Satomi had risen to her status by adhering to the percepts of Buddhism ; several of her Pack members utilized the mantra " Three things that can not be long hidden .
The sun , the moon , the truth " as an anchor for their animal nature .
Derek and Malia track down Satomi 's Pack to warn them of the Dead Pool , but they find members of the Pack slaughtered .

Scott figures out that Kate is whom Araya is referring to .
Araya spitefully tells Scott he would n't have believed her if she 'd just told him .

Instead , Araya watches on as Kate is defeated , severely mauled by Derek in a full - wolf - shapeshift .
When Kate escapes , Araya continues her hunt of Kate with Argent in tow as he agreed to , but on the condition she has to leave Scott and his Pack be .
Araya is most often portrayed as easily amused with a wide smile on her face , while simultaneously displaying her ruthlessness and cruelty towards supernaturals , particularly werewolves , typical of a hunter , or hunters who violate the Code , even people who cross her as she murdered one of her own men for " robbing " her .
While zealous and amoral as a hunter , Araya is ultimately fair as she follows the Hunter 's Code not to kill were - creatures unless there 's proof they 've harmed innocents .
Her base of operations is a music / dance club as she has an adoration for " the music of youth " .

When the Chimeras come to bleed mercury , the Doctors kill them off declaring them failures ; they are aiming , searching for a " success " .
In " A Novel Approach " , Theo reports to the Doctors Scott 's Pack is going to see Valack at Eichen at nightfall .
Eichen House was closed off to the Dread Doctors due to electromagnetic energy from the convergence of ley lines .

The Doctors ' methods were to achieve the process of reviving the ancient werewolf with their last chimera test subject serving as a host for the creature from their skills in pseudoscience .
All the other Chimeras were only guinea pigs to perfect their experiment .
Another requirement for the process to work was to kill off the failed Chimeras ( " Failure compromises the experiment pool " ) .
The Doctors also end their partnership with Theo , allowing him to use the Soldier 's blood to revive several Chimeras to form his own Pack .
With their work completed , the Doctors watch over and protect the Beast from discovery , covering up its carnage .
They now want the Beast to remember itself in its previous life .
To do this , they nurture its naturally lethal actions as it rampages throughout Beacon County , triggering the Beast 's shapeshifting using high - powered frequencies and inconspicuously leave the Beast the message ' Damnatio Memoriae ' .
In " The Beast of Beacon Hills " , after Scott 's Pack discover Mason is the host for the Beast , the Doctors abduct Mason hiding him in a cabin and hook him up to the Soldier preventing him from escaping to allow for the transformation to finish .
Scott , Liam and Theo arrive for Mason before the Doctors corner them , having anticipated Theo would come to take the Beast 's power .
The Surgeon goads his narcissistic henchman openly declaring him a failure for their experiment while also laying out their epiphany of their work .
The lead para - scientist adds Theo 's ultimate failure however provided a turning viewpoint in their paranormal research for the Chimeras , for reviving " La BÃªte " : the ' banality of evil ' .
The Dread Doctors initially believed that to resurrect the Beast , the perfect killer , they first needed the " perfect evil " .
They chose Theo as the ideal candidate as Theo would murder his caring sister given motive and opportunity .
However , they realized Theo failed in the end because ' true evil ' comes only from corrupting someone truly good which is why Mason is the success .
An infuriated Theo assaults his former masters to no use .

The lead para - scientist however , jolts awake and hears the voice of Beast of Gevuadan , Sebastien Valet calling to him .
He bursts out of the clinic , and staggers to his knees before Sebastien walks up to him .
Sebastien rips off the Mask , revealing his disfigured , inhuman face .
Sebastien recognizes the Surgeon as his loving friend , Marcel .
Sebastien scolds Marcel that if his appearance is what immortality promised him , he was misled .

He tells Sebastien the Pike , which he now uses as his cane was taken by the Argents .

In 1760 , Sebastien was a soldier alongside his faithful companion Marcel , and fought against the British in the French territory of Canada .
One rainy night , whilst he and Marcel were evading the British , Sebastien fell face - forward into a puddle and unintentionally drank from it .
The water - filled hole was a wolf 's footprint .
Sebastien , as a result of his disturbed persona , became a demonic werewolf .
Overtime , he started killing , driven to simply kill whoever and whatever came across his path .
His friend Marcel also became aware of his carnage , but steadfastly remained his ally , covering for him .
Soon Sebastien was mentioned with fear throughout GÃ©vaudan , becoming known as " La BÃªte " .
In 1764 , Sebastien and Marcel return to town entering the local pub where all are talking the Beast and he reunites with his sister , Marie - Jeanne .
Sebastien urges his sister to lead the hunting party for La BÃªte , which she eventually accepts after a little boy , the innkeeper 's son is found dead by a man , Henri .
Later at night , Marie - Jeanne 's hunting party is slaughtered by La BÃªte one by one , but Marie - Jeanne is saved by Henri via a mountain ash barrier .
Later on , Marie - Jeanne proposes a toast to honor the dead .
Sebastien plays along , but he and Marcel uncover the spiked wolfsbane in Marie - Jeanne 's mead .
Sebastien splutters and involuntarily starts to shapeshift with eyes glowing blue .
Sebastien unperturbedly waits as his sister walks over to him , having discovered his secret .
A tearful Marie - Jeanne tells him he is a monster .
Sebastien responds he 's a beast , " the Beast " to his sister , that he 'll kill anyone who crosses his path , because it is what he is .
Sebastien gives his sister a kiss to the forehead , tells her she wo n't go up against him because they 're family .
Three years later , Marie - Jeanne tracks her brother down .
Sebastien gives chase , attempts to kill her in his werewolf shape , but Marie - Jeanne reveals the pike hidden underneath the snow and impales the Beast .
Back in human form , Sebastien is unconcerned with his injury , confident he 'll heal from it and he will be remembered by history , that everyone will speak his name .
Marie - Jeanne responds no one will remember his name .
Affronted , Sebastien realizes she intends to invoke " Damnatio Memoriae " on his name .
Suddenly , Sebastien realizes he 's not healing
but he 's dying .
Marie - Jeanne reveals the pike is mystical , was forged with their blood .
In the Beast 's dying moments , Marie - Jeanne tells Sebastien everyone will remember him , " but only as a Beast . "
Sebastien dies .
During the Dread Doctors ' reign on Beacon Hills , they work on perfecting the process of reviving Sebastien Valet .
Using the teenage chimera Mason as a host , they produce an engineered version of Sebastien 's demonic Wolf form which Mason sporadically transforms into under the Doctors ' guidance as it kills its way throughout Beacon County .
The Beast gradually remembers its former incarnation , nurtured by the Dread Doctors ' actions .
In " The Beast of Beacon Hills " , the process fully completes , with Mason being enveloped by Sebastien 's essence , with Sebastien himself completely reviving once he shapeshifts back from the Beast shape .
Mason Hewitt now only exists as memory within Sebastien 's form .
In " Apotheosis " , the resurrected Beast of GÃ©vaudan accesses Mason 's memory and uses his vessel 's persona to adapt to the 20th century .
Having killed the Dread Doctors , but aware the Surgeon is still partially alive , he looks for the surviving para - scientist , becoming aware he took possession of the only weapon that 's capable of killing him , the Pike .
He finds the Surgeon , whose face is horribly ravaged from his centuries ' work but recognizes him as Marcel , his old comrade .
Sebastien is disaffected by Marcel 's centuries of twisted actions to bring him back , only demanding the location of the Pike .
Marcel , in his dying moments , tells him the Argents took the weapon .
Sebastien wreaks havoc throughout Beacon Hills searching for the Argents and the Pike , threatening Stilinski at the Sheriff 's station , mauling both Lydia and Hayden , fighting ferociously against Parrish , the Argents and disabling Theo Raeken attempting to steal his power in the process .
Sebastien finally comes face to face with Liam and Scott , and politely asks the Pike back .
The Alpha and Beta state they just want Mason .
Sebastien states he does n't know where to begin , but states that Mason is gone anyway .
The two werewolves take Sebastien on with all their might :
Sebastien easily overpowers them whilst mocking them for not fighting with a killer instinct .
He 's about to kill Scott , but he unintentionally taps into Scott 's memories , seeing images of Allison Argent .
Sebastien confusedly hesitates , mistaking Allison for his sister Marie - Jeanne , allowing Scott escapes his grip .
Right then , Lydia and Kira arrive :
Sebastien shifts into the Beast then moves to kill them .
Lydia Screams out Mason 's name in her banshee voice , powerful sound waves striking the Beast .
The power reverses the process , allowing Mason to separate from the Beast .
Having been stripped of a physical body , the Beast now only exists as a shadow .
Parrish arrives , catching and holding the Beast 's essence captive .
Scott then takes the opportunity to take the sword / cane and spears the Beast 's spirit with the weapon , the shadow dissipating vanquishing Sebastien Valet , the Beast of GÃ©vaudan once again .
Having killed close to 500 people , Sebastien Valet is a born monster , arrogant , diabolical , vain and boasting of his immense power , entitled in being the " famous and feared Beast of GÃ©vaudan " .
He has no emotions , no regard for any human life , not even those of his sister and Marcel and kills for the sake of killing , even his family , all so to carve himself in history .
Sebastien 's werewolf ability is the most powerful seen so far , surpassing even Peter 's Alpha capabilities , Deucalion 's as the Alpha Pack leader and those of Parrish , a hellhound : his strength , speed , durability and healing all extremely heightened , and completely indestructible due to being a sociopath relishing in his carnage .
He is fully vulnerable only to the mystical Pike forged by his sister .
When Sebastien shapeshifts , he is enveloped in dark energy and his clothes assimilate as part of his transformation .

Ghost Riders are humanoid horsemen dressed in cowboy hats and other " old west " clothing and are part of the Wild Hunt .
They are mentioned a few times in season 5 , but first appear in season 6 .
There are many Ghost Riders but only 3 are named , the Outlaw , the Enforcer and the Ranger .
The Ghost Riders tend to take and erase people who have seen them .
The process can be instant or gradual as the memory seems to disappear for different people at different times .
In the season 6 premiere , they take a couple whose son is left behind .
The boy is later taken as he saw his parents get taken .
The boy and his parents are instantly forgotten .
Stiles Stilinski encounters a Ghost Rider at the boy 's house .
His memory is gradually erased from those who knew him until Lydia Martin is the only one who still remembers him .
Stiles is taken by the Ghost Riders as Lydia watches on .
The Ghost Riders take people by shooting them with guns .
They also use whips and ropes to grab and erase their victims .
The whip carries a supernatural toxin that can kill if the victim is struck but not taken .
Victims disappear in a puff of green smoke .
The Ghost Riders deliver their victims to what appears to be a train station that only the Ghost Riders can enter and exit safely .
They apparently do n't erase banshees despite their ability to see them , which is evident in " Ghosted " when the Ghost Riders erased the residents of Canaan but leave behind a banshee named Lenore .
Lydia speculates that this may be because the Wild Hunt is connected to the old Irish legend of Morrigan , a mythical Irish figure that Lydia saya was a banshee .
She also figures out that once the Ghost Riders left Canaan , their victims became Ghost Riders .
Capturing a Ghost Rider is possible as Scott , Mason and Corey constructed a special cage that shielded it from electric currents to prevent the Ghost Rider from leaving once he enters the cage .
They then surrounded it with mountain ash as a precaution .
Killing a Ghost Rider was n't deemed possible until Garrett Douglas killed the Outlaw in " Heartless " .
This is due to the fact that he was infused with their power .
In " Memory Found " , Liam and Theo battle Ghost Riders and were able to kill a few of them with a bone saw and their own guns .
In " Riders on the Storm " , after Scott diverts the phantom train , the Ghost Riders holster their weapons and start to leave .
Garrett Douglas yells for them to come back , claiming that he is their master .
The Ghost Riders turn around and surround him .
Peter Hale points out to Garrett that the Ghost Riders have no leader .

He also reveals that the marks left on victims of the Oni is the Japanese kanji for self [ å·± ] indicating that said victim is still themselves and is not possessed by the Nogitsune .
He declares to Argent that he owes him his life , his honor because when Argent saved his life from before as Katashi had intended to flee and according to Yakuza code he would 've paid with his " head " for such an act of cowardice .
Silverfinger concludes with a warning that if they have a Nogitsune amongst them , they should let the Oni destroy it .

He reveals the duel was a cover story , used for one of the brothers being bitten in the woods by something " monstrous " and by the family 's code of honor the other brother put down his sibling .
Ironically , Kincaid bears unsheathed werewolf claws during the entire interview .
He restrains Isaac and brings him to Katashi , but when Katashi recognizes Argent , he lets Isaac go .
After Katashi is found murdered , Kincaid raids the federal transport vehicle in " Echo House " containing all the evidence surrounding the murder including his silver prosthetic and takes the finger .

Ikeda takes Deaton to the garden of his estate , the same location where Argent had conducted his first arms deal with the Yakuza , seen the Oni appear and slain the Nogitsune - possessed kumichÅ twenty - four years earlier .
The same kumichÅ happened to be Ikeda 's father .
Deaton asks Ikeda to hold a jar for him and takes a sample of the plant he was looking for , letharia vulpina , off a fountain .
In the past , Ikeda 's Nogitsune father had bled all over the very fountain when the Oni had impaled him on their Ninjatos .
When Deaton brought up the subject of his father , Ikeda pulled a gun on him .
Deaton revealed he had n't poisoned Yuki , he 'd given the wolf a paralytic toxin , Kanima venom , the same he 'd applied to the jar Ikeda was holding .
Ikeda falls paralyzed .
Deaton and Argent had set up the ruse at Ikeda 's estate to obtain a sample of the plant because it was quite special being born out of the Nogitsune 's blood and was used to poison the Nogitsune possessing Stiles .

Rhys immediately stepped into the riot preventing the soldiers from opening fire on the interns and tried to diffuse the chaos .
Rhys unfortunately was set aflame by a werewolf intern named Satomi much to Noshiko 's horror .
Because the doctor had also sold the morphine , Rhys died in absolute agony .
Noshiko 's fury over the death of her boyfriend was a key factor in her decision in unleashing the Nogitsune : unfortunately rather than possess Noshiko as she intended , the Dark Kitsune possessed Rhys ' corpse as it began its terror spree at Oak Creek and Eichen House .
Noshiko , with the help of Satomi , exorcised the Nogitsune from Rhys ' corpse and gave him peace .
Rhys was buried in the basement of Eichen House with a photo of Noshiko and her shattered katana with the Japanese kanji for " self " marked on the wall to show that he died as himself .
