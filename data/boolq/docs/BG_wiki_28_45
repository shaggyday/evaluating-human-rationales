HISTORY Section::::History .
Bank of the West began as Farmers National Gold Bank of San Jose , California , in 1874 .
When all bank notes became convertible to gold or silver in 1880 , the bank converted from a gold national bank and changed its name to the First National Bank of San Jose , California .
In 1970 , Banque Nationale de Paris ( BNP ) established the French Bank of California .
Later that decade , First National Bank of San Jose changed its name to Bank of the West .
In 1979 , BNP bought Bank of the West and merged in the French Bank of California .
The bank owned 35 locations and $ 350 million in assets .
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s , Bank of the West bought several other banks and branches .
In 1987 , Bank of the West bought Bank of Los Gatos .
This was followed by the 1990 purchase of Central Banking Systems ; the 1991 purchase of 30 branches in northern California from failed Imperial Savings and Loan ; the 1992 purchase of Atlantic Financial Federal Savings Bank from the Resolution Trust Corporation ; the 1993 purchase of 15 branches in northern California from Citibank for $ 360 million ; the 1995 purchase of NorthBay Savings Bank , headquartered in Petaluma , California ; and the 1997 purchase of branches from Bank of America and Coast Federal Bank .
In 1995 , First Hawaiian Bank established Pacific One Bank to hold 30 branches in Washington , Oregon , and Idaho that it acquired from West One Bank when that bank was acquired by U.S. Bancorp and had to divest certain assets , due to the number of preexisting branches of U.S. Bank in the region .
Three years later , in 1998 , BNP and First Hawaiian Inc. , the parent of First Hawaiian Bank and Pacific One Bank , created a company under the BancWest Bancorp name to hold Bank of the West and First Hawaiian Bank , with Bank of the West absorbing Pacific One .
The creation of BancWest Bancorp caused the now - called BNP Paribas 's ( BNPP ) ownership of the holding company to fall to 45 % .
BNPP also agreed not to increase its ownership of the bank holding company before November 2001 .
In 1999 , Bank of the West bought Sierra West Bancorp .
This transaction temporarily diluted BNPP 's ownership of the holding company to 42 % .
In May 2000 , BNP and Paribas merged to form BNP Paribas .
In 2001 , as part of the regulatory approval process with Wells Fargo Banks 's acquisition of First Security Corp. , Bank of the West acquired 23 First Security branches in New Mexico and seven First Security branches in Nevada to avoid antitrust issues with overlapping Wells Fargo operations .
Also in 2001 , First Hawaiian Bank bought Union Bank of California 's branches in Guam and Saipan .
First Hawaiian had established its first branch in Guam in 1970 and its first branch in Saipan in 1997 .
( Union Bank of California had established its branch in Guam in 1974 . )
In May 2001 , the independent directors of BancWest Bancorp established a special committee that then unanimously voted to accept BNP 's offer to acquire the remaining 55 % of BancWest Bancorp , making the holding company a wholly owned subsidiary of BNP .
The year 2001 concluded with the December purchase by Bank of the West of United California Bank from Japan 's UFJ Bank .
In March 2004 , Bank of the West announced the purchase of Community First Bankshares , a bank holding company that operated Community First National Bank , headquartered in Fargo , North Dakota , which had 155 offices in 12 states : Arizona , California , Colorado , Iowa , Minnesota , Nebraska , New Mexico , North Dakota , South Dakota , Utah , Wisconsin , and Wyoming .
Soon after , Bank of the West agreed to buy USDB Bancorp , the parent of Union Safe Deposit Bank .
In December 2005 , Bank of the West bought Commercial Federal Corporation of Omaha , Nebraska .
This merger added offices in Arizona , Colorado , Iowa , Kansas , Missouri , Nebraska , and Oklahoma to Bank of the West .
In January 2006 , Bank of the West opened a representative office in Tokyo , Japan , and in September 2007 , it opened a representative office in Taipei , Taiwan .
