LIST OF EARTHQUAKES IN THE BRITISH ISLES
The following is an extensive list of earthquakes that have been detected in the British Isles&Ireland .
On average , several hundred earthquakes are detected by the British Geological Survey each year , but almost all are far too faint to be felt by humans .
Those that are felt generally cause very little damage .
Nonetheless , earthquakes have on occasion resulted in considerable damage , most notably in 1580 and 1884 ; Musson ( 2003 ) reports that there have been ten documented fatalities – six caused by falling masonry and four by building collapse .
The causes of earthquakes in the UK are unclear , but may include " regional compression caused by motion of the Earth 's tectonic plates , and uplift resulting from the melting of the ice sheets that covered many parts of Britain thousands of years ago . "
Medieval reports of " earthquakes " that threw down newly built cathedrals may simply have been catastrophic failure of overloaded masonry , particularly towers , rather than actual tectonic events .
