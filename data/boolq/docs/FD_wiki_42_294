PRODUCTION
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Production .
Section::::Development .
Star Wars creator George Lucas discussed ideas for a sequel trilogy several times after the conclusion of the original trilogy , but denied any intent to make it .
In October 2012 , he sold his production company Lucasfilm , and with it the Star Wars franchise , to The Walt Disney Company .
Speaking alongside Lucasfilm 's new president , Kathleen Kennedy , Lucas said : " I always said I was n't going to do any more and that 's true , because I 'm not going to do any more , but that does n't mean
I 'm unwilling to turn it over to Kathy to do more . "
As creative consultant on the film , Lucas attended early story meetings and advised on the details of the Star Wars universe .
Among the materials he turned over to the production team were his rough story treatments for Episodes VII â€“ IX , which Lucas requested be read only by Kennedy , Bob Iger , Alan Horn , and Kevin Mayer .
Lucas later said Disney had discarded his story ideas and that he had no further involvement with the film .
Lucas 's son Jett told The Guardian that his father was " very torn " about having sold the rights to the franchise , despite having picked Abrams to direct , and that his father was " there to guide " but that " he wants to let it go and become its new generation " .
The Force Awakenss first screenplay was written by Michael Arndt .
Early drafts had Luke appear midway through the film , but Arndt found that " every time Luke came in and entered the movie , he just took it over .
Suddenly you did n't care about your main character anymore .
" Luke became the film 's MacGuffin and does not appear in person until the final scene .
Several directors were considered , including David Fincher , Brad Bird , Ben Affleck and Guillermo del Toro ; after a suggestion by Steven Spielberg to Kennedy , J. J. Abrams was named director in January 2013 , with Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg as project consultants .
Arndt worked on the script for eight months , but said he needed 18 more , which was more time than Disney or Abrams could give him .
The production announced Arndt 's exit from the project on October 24 , 2013 , and Kasdan and Abrams took over script duties .
Abrams expressed relief that the release date was announced for December 2015 instead of a previously discussed summer release .
He and Kasdan planned the story while walking in Santa Monica , New York City , Paris and London .
The first draft was completed in six weeks .
Abrams said the key to the film was to return to the roots of the first Star Wars film and be based more on emotion than explanation .
In January 2014 , Abrams confirmed that the script was complete .
In April 2014 , Lucasfilm clarified that Episodes VII â€“ IX would not feature storylines from the Star Wars expanded universe , though other elements could be included , as with the TV series Star Wars Rebels .
Abrams stated that he purposely withheld some plot elements from The Force Awakens , such as Finn and Rey 's last names and backgrounds .
Kennedy admitted that " we have n't mapped out every single detail [ of the sequel trilogy ] yet " , but said that Abrams was collaborating with The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson , and that Johnson would work with Episode IXs then - director Colin Trevorrow to ensure a smooth transition and that " everybody 's got a say in how we move forward with this " .
A fictional language was developed for use in the film by YouTube star Sara Forsberg , who created the viral video series " What Languages Sound Like To Foreigners " ; Forsberg developed the language by studying languages such as Hindi and Gujarati .
In November 2015 , Lucas recorded an hour - long interview with CBS News reporter Charlie Rose in which he said Disney had not been " keen " to involve him and conceded : " If I get in there , I 'm just going to cause trouble because they 're not going to do what I want them to do , and I do n't have the control to do that any more , and all it would do is just muck everything up . "
He also said , " They wanted to do a retro movie .
I do n't like that .
Every movie , I worked very hard to make them different â€¦ I made them completely different â€” different planets , different spaceships to make it new . "
In early December 2015 , Kathleen Kennedy told The Hollywood Reporter that Lucas had seen the movie and " liked it " .
In the same month , at the Kennedy Center Honors , Lucas said : " I think the fans are going to love it , It 's very much the kind of movie they 've been looking for . "
Abrams felt that , as the first in a new trilogy , the film " needed to take a couple of steps backwards into very familiar terrain " and use plot elements from previous Star Wars films .
PRE - PRODUCTION Section::::Pre - production .
In May 2013 , it was confirmed that The Force Awakens would be filmed in the United Kingdom .
Representatives from Lucasfilm met with Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to agree to produce The Force Awakens in the UK .
Osborne committed Â£ 25 million of public money towards the film , claiming it was a boost for British culture and the film industry .
According to production company account filings in the United Kingdom , The Force Awakens ultimately received a total of Â£ 31.6 million ( $ 47.4 million ) from the government .
Beginning in September 2013 , production spaces at the Bad Robot facility were converted for shooting of The Force Awakens for the benefit of shooting a minor portion of the film in the United States .
The film 's costume designer was Michael Kaplan , who had previously worked with Abrams on the films Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darkness .
Film editors Mary Jo Markey and Maryann Brandon , long - term collaborators with Abrams , were also signed .
In August 2013 , it was announced that cinematographer Daniel Mindel would be shooting the film on 35-mm film ( specifically Kodak 5219 ) .
In October 2013 , other crew members were confirmed , including sound designer Ben Burtt , director of photography Daniel Mindel , production designers Rick Carter and Darren Gilford , costume designer Michael Kaplan , special effects supervisor Chris Corbould , re - recording mixer Gary Rydstrom , supervising sound editor Matthew Wood , visual effects supervisors Roger Guyett and Matthew Cunnelly , and executive producer Jason McGatlin .
CASTING
Section::::Casting .
Casting began around August 2013 , with Abrams meeting with potential actors for script readings and screen tests .
Open auditions were held in the UK , Ireland , and the United States in November 2013 for the roles of Rachel and Thomas .
Casting began in earnest in January 2014 , because of changes to the script by Kasdan and Abrams .
Screen tests with actors continued until at least three weeks before the official announcement on April 29 , 2014 , with final casting decisions made only a few weeks earlier .
Actors testing had strict nondisclosure agreements , preventing them , their agents or their publicists from commenting on their involvement .
Though Lucas intimated that previous cast members Carrie Fisher , Harrison Ford , and Mark Hamill would return for the new film as early as March 2013 , their casting was not confirmed until over a year later .
Saoirse Ronan , Michael B. Jordan , and Lupita Nyong'o auditioned for new characters ; industry publications reported Jesse Plemons was considered , possibly for Luke Skywalker 's son ; Adam Driver for an unnamed villain ; and Maisie Richardson - Sellers for an unknown character .
In March 2014 , actor Dominic Monaghan said that Abrams was looking for three unknown actors to play the leads in The Force Awakens and that rumors of bigger - name stars were untrue .
Daisy Ridley was cast by February 2014 , and by the end of that month a deal had been worked out with Driver , who was able to work around his Girls schedule .
Talks with Andy Serkis and Oscar Isaac began by March and continued into April .
In April , John Boyega began talks after dropping out of a Jesse Owens biopic .
Denis Lawson , who played Wedge Antilles in the original trilogy , declined to reprise his role , saying it would have " bored " him .
On April 29 , 2014 , the cast was announced with a photo of the first table read of the script at Pinewood Studios near London , picturing director Abrams with Ford , Ridley , Fisher , Peter Mayhew , producer Bryan Burk , Lucasfilm president and producer Kathleen Kennedy , Domhnall Gleeson , Anthony Daniels , Hamill , Serkis , Oscar Isaac , Boyega , Driver , and writer Lawrence Kasdan .
The announcement was originally planned for May 4 ( Star Wars Day ) , but was announced early for fear of media leaks .
In June 2014 , cast additions Lupita Nyong'o and Gwendoline Christie were announced .
To prepare for his role , Hamill was assigned a personal trainer and a nutritionist at the request of the producers , who wanted him to resemble an older Luke .
Fisher was also assigned a personal trainer and a nutritionist .
Abrams initially considered using Daniels only in a voice role for C-3PO , but Daniels opted to reprise the role physically as well ; the production team built a new C-3PO costume to accommodate him .
A flashback scene was cut from Rey 's vision ( following her discovery of Luke 's lightsaber ) , which would have featured Robert Boulter standing in for Luke as he appeared in his duel with Vader in The Empire
Strikes Back .
In May , Abrams announced a donation contest for UNICEF from the Star Wars set in Abu Dhabi ; the winner was allowed to visit the set , meet members of the cast and appear in the film .
In October 2014 , Warwick Davis , who played Wald and Weazle in and Wicket in Return of the Jedi , announced that he would appear in The Force Awakens , but did not reveal his role .
In November 2014 , Debbie Reynolds confirmed that her granddaughter ( Fisher 's daughter ) , Billie Lourd , was in the film .
Isaac 's uncle , a Star Wars fan , was cast as an extra at Abrams 's invitation upon visiting the set .
In December 2015 , The Mail reported that Ford would be paid $ 25 million plus a 0.5 % share of the revenue .
Ridley and Boyega each would receive $ 460,000 plus a share if the movie grossed over $ 1 billion .
Fisher received $ 1.5 million ; Abrams was paid $ 5.1 million plus a 2 % share of the revenue .
For the original 1977 film , Ford was paid $ 10,000 ( ) .
FILMING Section::::Filming .
In February 2014 , Abrams said filming would begin in May and last about three months .
The official announcement came in March , when Disney and Lucasfilm announced that principal photography would commence in May and be based at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire , United Kingdom .
That month , it was revealed that pre - production filming would take place in Iceland prior to the start of official filming in May , consisting of landscape shots that would be used for scenery in the film .
In April , Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn confirmed that filming had begun , filming in secret in the UAE emirate of Abu Dhabi by a second - unit .
Later that month , it was revealed that in addition to 35 mm film , segments of the film were being shot in the 65 mm IMAX format .
In July , Bad Robot reported on Twitter that the film would be at least partially shot on IMAX cameras .
On May 4 , 2014 ( Star Wars Day ) , the studio posted a selfie taken by Iger with an unidentified actor in a Chewbacca costume .
Iger said the photo was taken when he visited Pinewood Studios two weeks earlier to discuss the shoot , " which was just about to start " , with Abrams , Kennedy , and Horn .
Principal photography began in Abu Dhabi on May 16 , 2014 .
Abrams and the cast members went to Abu Dhabi in early - May , where large sets were built on location â€“ including a shuttle - like spacecraft , a large tower , and a big market â€“ and where explosives were used to create a " blast crater " .
Cast members were spotted practicing driving vehicles that would be used during filming .
Production moved to Pinewood Studios in June .
That same month , Harrison Ford fractured his leg while filming at Pinewood after a hydraulic door on the Millennium Falcon set fell on him , and was taken to a hospital .
According to Abrams , Ford 's ankle " went to a 90-degree angle " .
Production was suspended for two weeks because of Ford 's injury .
Ford 's son Ben said the ankle would likely need a plate and screws and that filming could be altered slightly , with the crew needing to shoot Ford from the waist up for a short time until he recovered .
A month later , Jake Steinfeld , Ford 's personal trainer , said Ford was recovering rapidly .
Abrams also suffered a fractured vertebra in his back when he was trying to help lift the door after Ford 's accident , but he kept this to himself for over a month .
In February 2016 , it was reported that the Health and Safety Executive brought four criminal charges against Disney subsidiary Foodles Production ( UK ) , Ltd. for alleged health and safety breaches relating to Ford 's accident .
Foodles Production ( UK ) Ltd was subsequently fined $ 1.95 million in October 2016 for two health and safety breaches , after admitting the counts at an earlier hearing .
Storyboard artists Simon Duric said , " The security on the film was a challenge .
That script was locked in a safe .
Most of the time on a film you can sit at your desk with a copy of the script next to you .
On this , you could n't .
That 's fine but it was tricky in places .
We had people flying drones over Pinewood studios trying to take photographs .
It was nuts .
If a prop was being moved we had to have them covered in a big black sheet .
We were told in an email to be [ wary ] of drones . "
In July 2014 , filming took place over three days at Skellig Michael , an island off the coast of County Kerry , Ireland , with a cast including Mark Hamill and Daisy Ridley .
Landscape shots for the planet
Takodana were shot in July in the Lake District in the northwest of England .
Production was halted for two weeks in early August 2014
so Abrams could rework shooting in Ford 's absence and resumed with a fully healed Ford in mid - August .
In September , the former RAF Greenham Common military base in Berkshire was used and featured set constructions of several spaceships from the Star Wars Universe .
Puzzlewood in the Forest of Dean was used for forest scenes .
Principal photography ended on November 3 , 2014 .
POST - PRODUCTION Section::::Post - production .
Cinematographer Daniel Mindel said The Force Awakens would use real locations and scale models over computer - generated imagery to make it aesthetically similar to the original Star Wars trilogy .
Rian Johnson , director of The Last Jedi , reiterated that Abrams would use little CGI and more practical , traditional special effects , saying : " I think people are coming back around to [ practical effects ] .
It feels like there is sort of that gravity pulling us back toward it .
I think that more and more people are hitting kind of a critical mass in terms of the CG - driven action scene lending itself to a very specific type of action scene , where physics go out the window and it becomes so big so quick .
"
Abrams 's intention in prioritizing practical special effects was to recreate the visual realism and authenticity of the original Star Wars .
To that end , the droid BB-8 was a physical prop developed by Disney Research , created by special effects artist Neal Scanlan and operated live on set with the actors .
In February 2014 , Industrial Light & Magic ( ILM ) announced plans to open a facility in London , citing Disney 's Star Wars films as a catalyst for the expansion .
ILM 's Vancouver branch also worked on the special effects for the film .
Abrams supervised post - production and editing of the film at Bad Robot Productions ' headquarters in Santa Monica .
In August 2015 , he gave the film 's estimated running time as 124â€“125 minutes .
Abrams made changes to the film 's plot in the editing process to simplify the film , by removing some sequences shown in trailers : " At one point , Maz used to continue along with the characters back to the Resistance base , but we realised that she really had nothing to do there of value , except to be sitting around .
"
The film was converted to 3D in post - production .
MUSIC Section::::Music .
In July 2013 , John Williams was confirmed to compose the score .
The music for the film 's first two trailers was reworked from earlier Williams compositions .
He began working on the film in December 2014 , and by June 2015 had been through most of the film reels , working on a daily basis .
In May 2015 , Williams said he would return to themes from the previous films , such as those for Luke , Leia and Han , in ways that " will seem very natural and right in the moments for which we 've chosen to do these kinds of quotes .
There are n't many of them , but there are a few that I think are important and will seem very much a part of the fabric of the piece in a positive and constructive way . "
He said that working with Abrams was similar to the process he went through with Lucas in the earlier films .
Recording sessions for The Force Awakens began in June 2015 at the Sony Pictures Studios ' Barbra Streisand Scoring Stage in Culver City , with William Ross conducting most of the music .
The first day of recording was June 1 , 2015 .
Williams attended the sessions and conducted the remainder of the recordings .
Williams said the recording process was " very luxurious " , with 12 sessions scattered over a five - month period between June and November .
The score was recorded by the Hollywood Studio Symphony , a freelance orchestra , with sessions continuing on and off over that five - month period .
The 90-piece orchestra recorded 175 minutes of music , although nearly an hour of that was discarded , modified , or rerecorded as Abrams reedited the film .
Williams 's theme for Snoke was recorded by a 24-voice men 's chorus .
Gustavo Dudamel conducted the opening and end title music for the film at Williams 's behest .
Recording of the score was completed on November 14 , 2015 .
The film 's soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on December 18 , 2015 .
Williams 's score is more than two hours long .
Lin - Manuel Miranda and Abrams contributed music to the film 's cantina scene .
Abrams met Miranda at a performance of his Broadway musical Hamilton , where Miranda jokingly offered to compose cantina music , should it be needed .
Unknown to Miranda , Williams had previously told Abrams that he did not want to compose the music for that scene , wanting to focus on the orchestral score .
Abrams then contacted Miranda , and the two collaborated on the music for the scene over a period of two months .
South Korean boy band EXO released their song " Lightsaber " in collaboration with the film for its release in their home country on November 11 .
The promoted track was subsequently released as part of their Sing for You album with a Chinese version , as well as being released in Japanese .
Chinese pop singer Luhan provided the Chinese theme " Inner Force " for the Chinese release of the film .
RELEASE
Section::::Release .
Star Wars :
The Force Awakens premiered in Los Angeles at the TCL Chinese Theatre , El Capitan Theatre and Dolby Theatre on December 14 , 2015 .
A white tent stretched along Hollywood Boulevard from Orange Drive to Highland Avenue , covering the " massive " premiere event that hosted more than five thousand guests .
The film was released in 12 countries , including European nations ( such as Italy and France , releasing it on a Wednesday ) , the Philippines and Thailand on December 16 ; 32 countries including the United Kingdom ( releasing on a Thursday ) , Mexico and additional European , Asian , African , South American and Oceania countries on December 17 ; and in North America , Japan , Spain , and Venezuela on December 18 , in 3D and IMAX 3D.
It was released in India on December 25 and in China on January 9 , 2016 .
In North America , it had the widest release of December across 4,134 theaters of which 3,300 were 3D locations , a record 392 IMAX screens ( 13 of which were 70 mm ) , 451 premium large format screens , 146 D - Box locations , as well as releasing in the Dolby Vision format ( High dynamic range , Rec . 2020 color ) in Dolby Cinema .
Worldwide , it was released across 940 IMAX theaters , a new record .
On December 18 , 2015 , the film began playing on every IMAX screen in North America for four straight weeks up to January 14 , 2016 .
This made it the first film since Warner Bros. Pictures ' The Hobbit trilogy to receive such a release .
The film finally shed some of its IMAX screens with the release of The Revenant and The Finest Hours in mid - January 2016 .
On November 6 , 2014 , the film 's title was announced as Star Wars : The Force Awakens .
Similarly to The Empire
Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi , " Episode VII " was included in the film 's opening crawl , but not in its official title .
In December 2015 , Pablo Hidalgo , the creative executive at the Lucasfilm Story Group which handles all the canonical continuity for the Star Wars universe , revealed that the working title for the film was Shadow of the Empire " for the longest time " .
Advance ticket sales for the film began on October 19 , 2015 , and were in strong demand , resulting in online movie ticket sites crashing .
Vue Cinemas , the United Kingdom 's third - largest theater chain , sold 45,000 tickets in 24 hours , 10,000 of which were sold in 90 minutes , a record for the theater .
In the United States , the film pre - sold a record - breaking $ 6.5 million worth of IMAX ticket sales on a single day .
IMAX has never previously registered more than $ 1 million in pre - sales on a single day .
In total it sold over $ 50 million in pre - sales breaking the record .
This number was raised to $ 100 million including $ 50â€“60 million in advance ticket sales by December 14 .
However , not all tickets that were pre - sold were for the film 's opening weekend , with Fandango President Paul Yanover saying " people have set aside tickets for screenings in January , weeks after the big opening â€¦ We have people buying Star Wars
[ The Force Awakens ] into 2016 .
It 's not just an opening - weekend phenomenon . "
Similarly , the film broke pre - sales records in the UK , Canada , and Germany .
The film is the first live - action Star Wars film not to be released theatrically by 20th Century Fox ; accordingly the film is not introduced with either that company 's logo , or its signature fanfare composed by Alfred Newman .

COMMERCIAL ANALYSIS
Section::::Commercial analysis .
With a production budget of $ 306 million , plus $ 175 million for marketing , printing and advertising costs , The Force Awakens was predicted to be a major box office success .
The cost of the film was subsidized by Â£ 31.6 million ( $ 47 million USD ) from the UK film incentive program .
Total costs , after accounting for profit participations , production and distribution of home videos , as well as other ancillary mediums , is expected to run $ 423 million .
Reports in April 2015 from The Hollywood Reporter and Amboee Brand Intelligence predicted the film would earn up to $ 540 million worldwide for its opening , breaking the record for the biggest worldwide opening , as well as breaking the record for the biggest U.S. opening .
They believed that The Force Awakens would have the widest release ever , across 4,500 theaters in North America .
Instead , it received a total of 4,134 theaters , and had the widest December opening .
Box office analyst Phil Contrino likened the film to Avatar ( 2009 ) , which opened to $ 77 million in North America and went on to earn $ 2.8 billion worldwide , saying The Force Awakens would earn $ 1 billion " without blinking " and could gross $ 2 billion .
In August 2015 , Deadline Hollywood predicted an opening weekend of $ 615 million worldwide could be possible , including a $ 300 million opening in North America .
In November , box office analysts reported opening weekend projections were at $ 175â€“250 million .
In December , capital analyst Barton Crockett suggested that the film will be the first to gross over $ 3 billion worldwide at the box office .
Analysts said that the box office receipts of the film , when compared to predecessors , must be adjusted for inflation , and that the first Star Wars film made more when this adjustment is made .
It has further been observed that each of the first three films in the series was more profitable in calculating revenue against production costs .
Box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian said that while Avatar and The Force Awakens were both released on the same date of December 18 , higher ticket prices in 2015 and IMAX screenings could push Star Wars " into the box office stratosphere " .
On December 23 , Mark Hughes of Forbes stated that The Force Awakens had matched the most optimistic projections for its opening , and he predicted that The Force Awakens would likely surpass Titanic as the second - highest - grossing film of all time .
He commented that The Force Awakens could catch Avatar as the top - grossing film of all time , but only if it managed to avoid major week - to - week declines in ticket sales .
By January 13 , analysts concluded that it was unlikely that The Force Awakens would surpass Avatar 's global gross .
While The Force Awakens was very successful in North America , the same success was not witnessed in many overseas individual markets such as Germany , India , Latin America , and parts of Asia .
One cited reason for this is that overseas audiences do not have the same nostalgia or affinity for the film as those in the U.S.
The Star Wars franchise has traditionally lacked resonance with filmgoers in China , and marketing for The Force Awakens heavily focused on appealing to that market .
Pamela McClintock of The Hollywood Reporter stated that , for these territories , Star Wars " does n't have the same legacy as it does in North America and more mature markets .
It 's also a faster burn , meaning it likely wo n't stay in theaters as long as Avatar did . "
Dergarabedian said , " As in all box - office trajectories , the higher the altitude , the tougher it becomes to rack up sales at the kind of breakneck pace as in the beginning of the run . "
Nancy Tartaglione of Deadline.com argued that , if accounting for its 40/60 domestic to international split , The Force Awakens did well overseas .
Avatar did well internationally because of its novelty , the marketing campaign advertising it as showcasing the newest 3D technology that can only be fully appreciated in the theaters , and because of its extended time in overseas theaters .
While The Force Awakens had appeal with its special effects , analysts feel that it lacked the novelty factor ; they also cite that its gross was stilted due to markets making way for new films sooner than was previously done .
Films do not play in overseas theaters as long as they did back when Avatar was released .
Dergarabedian stated , " No matter what , [ The Force Awakens ] is an absolute , all - out blockbuster without peer in terms of the sheer speed at which it has crossed all of these major box - office milestones . "
Moreover , Mike Fleming of Deadline.com argued that the movie was the " most valuable movie " of the year , with " the net profit to Disney an astounding $ 923 M , and the Cash on Cash Return
twice that of any other film [ released in 2016 ] , at 2.31 " .

That it achieves this both immediately and joyously is perhaps the single greatest relief of the movie - going year . "
Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave it five stars out of five , writing that it was " both a narrative progression from the earlier three films and a shrewdly affectionate next - gen reboot â€¦ ridiculous and melodramatic and sentimental of course , but exciting and brimming with energy and its own kind of generosity .
"

Andrew O'Hehir wrote for Salon that it was " the work of a talented mimic or ventriloquist who can just about cover for the fact that he has nothing much to say " .
Stephanie Zacharek of TIME wrote that Abrams had delivered " everything we expect , as opposed to those nebulous wonders
we did n't know we wanted " .
Reviewing for Forbes , Scott Mendelson cited the film 's " top - tier production values and a strong sense of scale and scope " , but felt it was so much " an exercise in fan service [
that ] it is only due to the charisma and talent of our newbies and J. J. Abrams ' undeniable skill as a visual storyteller that the Mad Libs narrative does n't outright destroy the picture " .
Brian Merchant of Motherboard wrote that " Science fiction is supposed to be all about exploring the unexplored , not rehashing the well - trod â€¦ one of the most unabashedly creative enterprises of the 20th century has been rendered another largely enjoyable , but mostly forgettable Hollywood reboot . "
In an interview with journalist Charlie Rose that aired on December 24 , 2015 , Lucas likened his decision to sell Lucasfilm to Disney to a " divorce " and outlined the creative differences between him and the producers of The Force Awakens .
Lucas described the previous Star Wars films as his " children " and criticized the " retro feel " of The Force Awakens , saying : " I worked very hard to make [ my films ] completely different , with different planets , with different spaceships â€“ you know , to make it new . "
Lucas also likened Disney to " white slavers " , which drew some criticism ; he subsequently apologized .
