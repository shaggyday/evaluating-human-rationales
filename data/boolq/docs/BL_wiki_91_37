Section::::Montreal Expos .
The Montreal Expos selected Raines in the fifth round of the 1977 Major League Baseball draft .
After debuting with six games as a pinch runner in 1979 , he played briefly as a second baseman for the Expos in 1980 but soon switched to playing the outfield , and rapidly became a fan favorite due to his aggressiveness on the basepaths .
In the strike - interrupted 1981 rookie season , he batted .304 and set a then Major League Baseball rookie record with 71 stolen bases , breaking the previous mark of 56 steals set by Gene Richards in 1977 .
Raines was caught stealing for the first time in 1981 , after having begun his career with a major league record 27 consecutive successful stolen bases .
Raines was the runner - up for the National League 's Rookie of the Year Award in 1981 , which was won by Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Fernando Valenzuela .
Raines ' performance dipped in 1982 , as he hit .277 with a .353 on - base percentage .
At the end of the season , Raines entered treatment for substance abuse , having spent an estimated $ 40,000 that year on cocaine .
To avoid leaving the drug in his locker , Raines carried it in his hip pocket , and slid headfirst when running the bases .
He used cocaine before games , in his car , after games , and on some occasions , between innings in the clubhouse .
Raines would later testify at the Pittsburgh drug trials , in September 1985 .
In 1983 , Raines stole a career high of 90 bases , the second - highest total in franchise history , and scored 133 runs , a franchise record .

In each season from 1981 to 1986 , Raines stole at least 70 bases .
He had a career - high .334 batting average in 1986 , winning the National League Batting Championship .
Raines maintained a consistently high on - base percentage during this period and a rising slugging percentage , reaching a career peak of .429 in 1987 .
Although he never won a Gold Glove Award , Raines was an excellent defensive player who led the National League with 21 assists in 1983 and , with 4 double plays , tied for the league lead in double plays by an outfielder in 1985 .
Raines became a free agent on November 12 , 1986 , but in spite of his league - leading play , no team made a serious attempt to sign him .
( During this period , the Major League Baseball owners acted in collusion to keep salaries down . )
On May 1 , 1987 , hours after being permitted to negotiate again with Montreal , Raines signed a new deal with the Expos for $ 5,000,000 over three years , and a $ 900,000 signing bonus .
In his first game back , on May 2 , facing the Mets , although Raines had not participated in spring training or any other competitive preparation for the season , he hit the first pitch he saw off the right - field wall for a triple .
Raines finished the game with four hits in five at - bats , three runs , one walk , a stolen base , and a game - winning grand slam in the 10th inning .
Even without having played in April , Raines led the Expos in runs , walks , times on base , runs created , and stolen bases , in addition to batting average , on - base percentage , and slugging percentage .
He also garnered MVP honors in the All - Star Game as he delivered a game - winning triple in the 13th inning .
