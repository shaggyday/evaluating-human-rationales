LEGAL ISSUES 2013 DISCRIMINATION SETTLEMENT Section::::Legal issues .
Section::::2013 discrimination settlement .
In December 2013 , the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) announced a settlement with Ally Financial to resolve alleged discrimination in its indirect auto lending program .
According to the consent order , Ally charged African American borrowers an average of 29 basis points more than similarly situated White borrowers , Hispanic borrowers
20 basis points more than White borrowers , and Asian / Pacific Islanders 22 basis points more than White borrowers .
The CFPB concluded that these disparities were statistically significant , based on race , and not based on creditworthiness or objective criteria related to borrower risk .
The CFPB also alleged that the higher markups resulted from Ally 's specific policy and practice of allowing dealers to mark up a consumer 's interest rate above Ally 's established buy rate and then compensating dealers based on the markup .
Under the terms of the consent order , Ally was required to establish a compliance committee , submit a compliance plan to the CFPB and United States Department of Justice for review , and pay $ 80 million in consumer monetary damages and $ 18 million in civil penalties .
