LIST OF MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL SINGLE - GAME STRIKEOUT LEADERS
In baseball , a strikeout occurs when a pitcher throws three strikes to a batter during his time at bat .
Twenty different pitchers have struck out at least 18 batters in a single nine - inning Major League Baseball ( MLB ) game as of 2016 , the most recent being Max Scherzer of the Washington Nationals on May 11 , 2016 .
Four players have accomplished the feat more than once in their career ; no player has ever struck out more than 20 batters in a nine - inning game .
( Tom Cheney struckout 21 in a 16-inning game . )
Charlie Sweeney was the first player to strike out 18 batters in a single game , doing so for the Providence Grays against the Boston Beaneaters on June 7 , 1884 .
In spite of this , Bob Feller is viewed as the first pitcher to accomplish the feat , since his then - record 18 strikeouts was the first to occur during the 20th century and the live - ball era .
Out of the twenty pitchers who have accomplished the feat , fifteen were right - handed and five pitched left - handed .
Five of these players have played for only one major league team .
Five pitchers — Steve Carlton , Roger Clemens , Randy Johnson , Nolan Ryan and Tom Seaver — are also members of the 3,000 strikeout club .
Sweeney has the fewest career strikeouts in the group with 505 , while Nolan Ryan , with 5,714 , struck out more batters than any other pitcher in major league history .
Bill Gullickson and Kerry Wood are the only rookies to have achieved the feat .
Tom Seaver concluded his milestone game by striking out the final ten batters he faced , setting a new major league record for most consecutive strikeouts .
Of the eleven players eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame who have struck out 18 batters in a game , six have been elected ; all six were elected on the first ballot .
Players are eligible for the Hall of Fame if they have played in at least 10 major league seasons , and have either been retired for five seasons or deceased for at least six months .
These requirements leave two players ineligible who are active , two players ineligible who are living and have played in the past five seasons , and five who did not play in 10 major league seasons .

18 STRIKEOUTS IN EXTRA - INNING GAMES Section::::18 strikeouts in extra - inning games .
Seven different pitchers have struck out at least 18 batters in an extra - inning Major League Baseball ( MLB ) game to date .
Only Nolan Ryan accomplished the feat more than once in his career and no player has ever struck out more than 21 batters in a game .
The following list is kept separate from the above list of pitchers who have struck out 18 or more batters in a nine - inning game .
This is due to the differing number of innings pitched during an extra - inning game , the lack of a definitive endpoint to the game that would otherwise allow for a fair comparison to be made , and the advantage of having more opportunities to strike out players during an extra - inning game as opposed to one lasting nine innings .
