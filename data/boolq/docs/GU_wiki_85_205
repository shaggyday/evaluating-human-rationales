Entertainment Weekly included the show in the 10 TV events to look forward to in 2011 .
Critic David Hinckley from the New York Daily News gave the show a positive review , noting it " would be interesting enough if it were just Quincy with better legs .
Add the other elements and you have something worth checking out at 10 o'clock " .
Other reviews were more negative , commenting on the clichéd plot and character development .
Las Vegas Weekly critic Josh Bell commented that " The problem is that Megan 's personal issues are as clichéd and clumsily presented as her boilerplate murder cases , and the show makes strained connections between the two that do n't really hold together .
"
The Detroit News called it " saggy , predictable and preachy , the series debut was delayed for months and still does n't have what it takes to impress viewers .
What a poor replacement for Detroit 1 - 8 - 7 .
"
The Los Angeles Times said " Murphey and the writers will have to do a lot of heavy lifting for Body of Proof to transcend its immediate predictability .
There 's only so much Delany can do with a cardboard show .
God may be in the details , but the walls still have to hold . "
