CANDIDATE VENUES
* † – American football team .

Although sponsored stadium names are listed in this article , they were not used in the actual bid documents , and would not be used during the World Cup .
FIFA controls all naming rights related to the World Cup , and generally prohibits the use of such names .
Even stadiums that bear the names of FIFA sponsors are subject to this restriction — the venue then known commercially as Coca - Cola Park in Johannesburg was known by its non - commercial name of Ellis Park Stadium during the 2010 World Cup , even though The Coca - Cola Company is one of FIFA 's main sponsors .
