Trump had initially approached Ruffin two years earlier about developing a property on or near the Las Vegas Strip .
Construction on Trump Tower Las Vegas was to begin in six to seven months , and was expected to last approximately 18 months .
In August 2003 , Ruffin said the tower had been decreased to 43 stories and was expected to cost $ 272 million .
In November 2003 , Trump denied that the project had been delayed or that it was suffering from a lack of financing .
Trump also said he was considering " something on a larger scale " for the project .
In July 2004 , Ruffin said the project had been delayed up to that point because of other business ventures , including Trump 's reality television show , The Apprentice .
That month , Trump and Ruffin announced revised plans for Trump International Hotel and Tower , a $ 300 million condominium - hotel with over 1,000 units .
Although Trump held a Nevada gaming license , he chose not to include a casino on the property .
Donald Trump 's son Eric Trump later said , " We have no problem getting a gaming license , but we wanted to do something different here .
We wanted a true luxury resort experience .
It 's hard to have a high - quality product when you walk into ' ding , ding , ding ' and there are people walking around in Hawaiian shirts with big plastic drink mugs . "
Ruffin appeared in an October 2004 episode of The Apprentice to sign a $ 300 million deal with Trump regarding the project .
The project was referenced again in the show 's second - season finale , when winner Kelly Perdew was offered a job at the property .
Jack Wishna , who introduced Trump to Ruffin , was a minority partner in the project .
In January 2005 , the project was valued at $ 1 billion .

Condominium units went on sale the same day with the opening of a $ 3 million temporary sales center at the corner of South Las Vegas Boulevard and Fashion Show Drive , in front of the New Frontier .
The building was , and featured a 10-foot replica of the tower .
That month , an NBA team was in negotiations to purchase an entire floor of the tower , while Trump was considering an alternative version of The Apprentice that would involve the tower .
Construction was expected to begin by the end of that summer , and was expected to last 24 to 30 months .
Construction began in November 2005 , when the building 's foundation was poured .
After the completion of a 36,000-square - foot recreational deck in March 2006 , an average of 800 workers constructed one new floor for the tower approximately every six days .
The tower was topped out on May 25 , 2007 .

SECOND TOWER Section::::Second tower .
By April 2005 , a second , identical 64-story tower was being planned , due to popular demand .
Sales of the second tower were planned to begin by the end of 2005 , with a 35 percent increase in prices from the first tower .
In November 2005 , the second tower was planned to open sometime in 2009 .
In April 2007 , the second tower was the subject of an episode of The Apprentice in which the show 's candidates were tasked with creating a marketing program for the new tower .
Condo units for the tower went on sale the next day .
Trump said the tower would be nearly identical to the first tower , and would also include 1,282 units .
Because of rising construction expenses , the second tower was expected to cost $ 625 million , which would have brought the total cost of Trump International Hotel and Tower to $ 1.1 billion .
This number was later reported to be $ 1.2 billion in February 2008 , at which point the second tower was expected to begin construction at the end of the year .
In April 2008 , Trump said he had not decided on a start date for the second tower , choosing to wait until all sales had closed on the first tower 's rooms .
At that time , reservations were still being accepted for the second tower 's units .
The second tower was ultimately put on hold because of bad credit markets .
In August 2015 , Eric Trump spoke of the potential for the second tower : " I think in time it 's a very good possibility . "
