WATER TABLE
The water table is the upper surface of the zone of saturation .
The zone of saturation is where the pores and fractures of the ground are saturated with water .
The water table is the surface where the water pressure head is equal to the atmospheric pressure ( where gauge pressure = 0 ) .
It may be visualized as the " surface " of the subsurface materials that are saturated with groundwater in a given vicinity .
The groundwater may be from precipitation or from groundwater flowing into the aquifer .
In areas with sufficient precipitation , water infiltrates through pore spaces in the soil , passing through the unsaturated zone .
At increasing depths , water fills in more of the pore spaces in the soils , until a zone of saturation is reached .
Below the water table , in the phreatic zone ( zone of saturation ) , layers of permeable rock that yield groundwater are called aquifers .
In less permeable soils , such as tight bedrock formations and historic lakebed deposits , the water table may be more difficult to define .
The water table should not be confused with the water level in a deeper well .
If a deeper aquifer has a lower permeable unit that confines the upward flow , then the water level in this aquifer may rise to a level that is greater or less than the elevation of the actual water table .
The elevation of the water in this deeper well is dependent upon the pressure in the deeper aquifer and is referred to as the potentiometric surface , not the water table .
FORM Section::::Form .
The water table may vary due to seasonal changes such as precipitation and evapotranspiration .
In undeveloped regions with permeable soils that receive sufficient amounts of precipitation , the water table typically slopes toward rivers that act to drain the groundwater away and release the pressure in the aquifer .
Springs , rivers , lakes and oases occur when the water table reaches the surface .
Groundwater entering rivers and lakes accounts for the base - flow water levels in water bodies .
SURFACE TOPOGRAPHY Section::::Surface topography .
Within an aquifer , the water table is rarely horizontal , but reflects the surface relief due to the capillary effect ( capillary fringe ) in soils , sediments and other porous media .
In the aquifer , groundwater flows from points of higher pressure to points of lower pressure , and the direction of groundwater flow typically has both a horizontal and a vertical component .
The slope of the water table is known as the hydraulic gradient , which depends on the rate at which water is added to and removed from the aquifer and the permeability of the material .
The water table does not always mimic the topography due to variations in the underlying geological structure ( e.g. , folded , faulted , fractured bedrock ) .
PERCHED WATER TABLES
Section::::Perched water tables .
A perched water table ( or perched aquifer ) is an aquifer that occurs above the regional water table , in the vadose zone .
This occurs when there is an impermeable layer of rock or sediment ( aquiclude ) or relatively impermeable layer ( aquitard ) above the main water table / aquifer but below the land surface .
If a perched aquifer 's flow intersects the surface , at a valley wall , for example , the water is discharged as a spring .
FLUCTUATIONS
TIDAL FLUCTUATIONS
Section::::Fluctuations .
Section::::Tidal fluctuations .
On low - lying oceanic islands with porous soil , freshwater tends to collect in lenticular pools on top of the denser seawater intruding from the sides of the islands .
Such an island 's freshwater lens , and thus the water table , rises and falls with the tides .
SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS
Section::::Seasonal fluctuations .
In some regions , for example , Great Britain or California , winter precipitation is often higher than summer precipitation and so the groundwater storage is not fully recharged in summer .
Consequently , the water table is lower during the summer .
This disparity between the level of the winter and summer water table is known as the " zone of intermittent saturation " , wherein the water table will fluctuate in response to climatic conditions .
LONG - TERM
FLUCTUATIONS Section::::Long - term fluctuations .
Fossil water is groundwater that has remained in an aquifer for several millennia and occurs mainly in deserts .
It is non - renewable by present - day rainfall due to its depth below the surface , and any extraction causes a permanent change in the water table in such regions .
EFFECTS ON SEA LEVEL Section::::Effects on sea level .
Aquifer drawdown or overdrafting and the pumping of fossil water may be a contributing factor to sea - level rise .
EFFECTS ON CROP YIELD Section::::Effects on crop yield .
Most crops need a water table at a minimum depth because at shallower depths the crop suffers a yield decline .
For some important food and fiber crops a classification was made : !
