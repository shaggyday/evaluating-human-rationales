DEVELOPMENT CASTING AND CREATION Section::::Development .
Section::::Casting and creation .
Drew was cast in late September 2009 and first appeared on the show in the fifth episode of the sixth season as one of the residents from the Mercy West Hospital after its merger with Seattle Grace .
Drew was brought aboard Grey 's Anatomy after former collaborations with the Series ' producer and creator Shonda Rhimes ; she was formally featured as a guest in two episodes of Private Practice in 2008 and was one of the main cast in Rhimes television pilot Inside the Box ( 2009 ) which was eventually not picked up by ABC .
Her casting came after the absence of some of the central cast members , notably Katherine Heigl departure after her maternity leave and Ellen Pompeo 's absence due to pregnancy .
Drew was originally contracted to guest star in a multi - episodes story arc where her character would be eventually fired from the series after two episodes .
She explained : " I came on to the show
and I was told from day one that I was only going to be there for two episodes .
I did not expect anything beyond that .
The morning my firing episode aired , my agent got a call that they were talking about a contract
and I was just completely floored . "
However she was promoted to a series regular on June 9 , 2010 for the seventh season of the show .
Rhimes said in the wake of the news : " Kepner has really been folded into the group " of Grey 's Anatomy adding " It 'll depend on what the studio and the network decide to do with those actors , but I fully advocate to have [ the characters ] " .
Drew received the call for her promotion the morning after the sixth episode of season six was telecast on October 29 , 2009 .
She described the call as a " totally happy surprise " .
CHARACTERIZATION Section::::Characterization .
Drew 's character has been called intelligent , hardworking , thorough and determined by Grey 's Anatomy executives .
But she is also considered vulnerable , insecure , sensitive and overly eager by her colleagues .
Of the character , Drew said : " April is a very , very good doctor .
She really knows what she 's doing , she 's worked really hard , and she certainly wants to do her best and stick around . "
but also described her as " annoying " , " neurotic " and " really insecure " .
In the eighth season , April 's position as chief resident and her struggle to get a handle on her fellow residents formed the central arc of her storyline .
Rhimes explained : " Watching April try to be in charge of Cristina and Alex and Jackson is a pretty impossible task , and it 's made for comedy , it 's one of the funniest things we 're working on this season . "
One of Kepner 's central characteristics is her religious belief , notably her chastity and her instance on saving herself for someone she truly loves .
In an interview , Drew assessed that : There certainly has never been a 28-year - old virgin on Grey 's .
I do n't even think there 's been a 28-year - old virgin on television .
Unless it 's someone who is sort of a recluse .
A normal , smart , doctor ‚Ä¶ .pretty , healthy ‚Ä¶ that in and of itself is really fascinating , and really interesting , and totally different .
It 's neat to see someone who is just totally clueless in that area .
Everyone else [ On Grey ' Anatomy ] seems like they know exactly what they 're doing .
April is totally , totally clueless .
Shonda told one of the directors , there are virgins that have sort of done everything else .
But not April .
April 's really pretty much done nothing .
She 's completely untouched . "
RELATIONSHIPS Section::::Relationships .
Kepner entertained several relationships throughout her time on Grey 's Anatomy .
In her early appearances , she is introduced as the best friend and roommate of her fellow Mercy West resident , Reed Adamson .
In the season six finale , when Reed is tragically murdered by Gary Clark during the shooting , April is the first to find her when she trips over her dead body .
In season seven April forms a friendship with Meredith Grey and she eventually moves into her house .
Ellen Pompeo offered regarding their bond : " Meredith will accept April in order to get the audience to accept her , " and Drew further explained : " She 's being plugged into the community .
Meredith has really taken her under her wing , is really looking out for her .
Having Meredith come around to April helps the audience come around to April . "
She first develops a crush on Derek Shepherd in season six .
Carina MacKenzie from The Los Angeles Times called it " ridiculous " and added : " April is drooling all over Chief McDreamy .
Vomit .
( ... ) She 's been reduced to a 12-year - old with hearts in her eyes and a painful inability to be subtle .
"
Drew herself was skeptical about it , saying : " The biggest thing that people did not like about my character was they thought I was a threat for the Mer / Der relationship , which I kind of found was super ridiculous ( ... )
I never saw it as anything that would ever transpire into something that might threaten them .
I only saw it as a really pathetic little crush .
" She briefly has feelings for Alex Karev who almost makes her lose her virginity when he tries to sleep with her in Something 's Got ta Give .
Wetpaint commented that Alex made her feel " worthless and unwanted when she was at her most vulnerable . "
Kepner also briefly dates Dr. Robert Stark , a senior pediatric surgical attending .
After her fellow residents make fun of her , she breaks up with him , creating a coldness between them .
However , it is Stark who recommends her as chief resident to Dr. Hunt .
Drew stated : " She sees a side to Dr. Stark that he does n't show to anyone else at the hospital , and she finds that part endearing ...
I think they enjoy the companionship . "
In the end of season eight , Kepner embarks on a relationship with her best friend turned lover Jackson Avery ( Williams ) , who she loses her virginity to and that eventually leads her to reflect on her faith and fail her boards .
Critics praised the chemistry between April and Jackson .
Rhimes commented on the dynamic between the two in season nine and said : " I think it 's going to be funny , sexy , and good . "
RECEPTION Section::::Reception .
Initially , Carina MacKenzie of the Los Angeles Times highly praised the characterization of Kepner .
writing : " One of my favorite Mercy Westers is intern April ( Sarah Drew ) .
Her saccharine - sweet attitude and wide - eyed insincerity were hilarious , as was her super - mysterious hot pink notebook full of morale - boosting platitudes . "
However , she criticized the later development of her story , especially her crush on Derek Shepherd calling it " vomit " PopSugar noted similarities between Kepner and Lexie Grey , stating : " Am I the only one who thinks the new doctor is kind of like Lexie 2.0 ?
Their dynamic reminded me of when Lexie first started and tries really hard to make nice with Mere , but gets the cold shoulder in return . "
Mariella Mosthof from Wetpaint stated : " Despite her obnoxious yet well - meaning tendencies , we briefly flirted with the idea of liking April 's character last season , and it looks like there 's plenty of opportunity for her to come back and charm us again yet again this time around . "
Reviewing the first part of the eight season , Courtney Morrison of TV Fanatic wrote : " Although the girl has grown in terms of likeability , her downfalls still outweigh the positives .
She does n't really bring too much to the table .
She was n't the best choice for Chief Resident ; she does n't seem to be on the same level surgical wise and she has n't carried a story on her own that makes us care about her . "
Kepner was included in TV Guide list of The Most Loathed TV Characters , adding : " The extremely neurotic April ( she makes Liz Lemon look laid back ) has slowly made strides with fans thanks to her personal setbacks ‚Äî she lost her treasured virginity to her best friend and failed her boards ‚Äî but she still has a long way to go . "
Entertainment Weekly also named her one of the " 21 Most Annoying TV Characters Ever " , commenting : "
April 's lightened up a little this season [ season 9 ] , but a few episodes of sympathetic behavior ca n't erase the painful memories of Seattle Grace - Mercy West 's most irritating doctor being . "
TV Fanatic included her in their list of Worst Character on TV .
Christina Tran commented : " Could she be any more annoying ? ! ? "
Drew stated that it was initially " hard " for her as an actress to play an unpopular character but deemed her " interesting " and when she was informed by the writers that her character would get Dr. Shepherd ( Dempsey ) shot in the season six finale , her reaction was : " Oh , come on , guys , really ?
They already hate my character , now they 're going to hate her even more ! "
Critics reception gradually changed positively .
Entertainment Weekly noted : " April was chirpy , irritating , and immature , and her crush on Derek did n't endear her to us either .
But these days , we say hooray for April ; since Meredith declared that the two of them are pals , April 's become a lot more tolerable , instead of being Lexie 2.0 . "
Courtney Morrison of TVFanatic wrote : " April has grown since her character was introduced .
She 's no longer much less annoying than she used to be , and she 's honest .
A girl with principles is a girl you want to do well . " and described her and Avery as " a couple for whom viewers can root " .
The Hollywood Reporter also remarked : " It 's nice to see April with a bit of a backbone and putting Alex in his place as the newfound confidence suits her well . "
