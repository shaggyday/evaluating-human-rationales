CAP ( SPORT )
In sport , a cap is a metaphorical term for a player 's appearance in a game at international level .
The term dates from the practice in the United Kingdom of awarding a cap to every player in an international match of association football .
In the early days of football , the concept of each team wearing a set of matching shirts had not been universally adopted , so each side would distinguish itself from the other by wearing a specific sort of cap .
An early illustration of the first international football match between Scotland and England in 1872 shows the Scottish players wearing cowls , and the English wearing a variety of school caps .
The practice was first approved on 10 May 1886 for association football after a proposal made by N. Lane Jackson , founder of the Corinthians :
The act of awarding a cap is now international and is applied to other sports .
Although in some sports physical caps may not now always be given ( whether at all or for each appearance ) the term " cap " for an international or other appearance has been retained as an indicator of the number of occasions on which a sportsperson has represented a team in a particular sport .
Thus , a " cap " is awarded for each game played and so a player who has played x games , for the team , is said to have been capped x times or have won x caps .
The practice of awarding a physical cap varies from sport to sport .
It may be awarded prior to a player 's debut or , particularly for national teams , a commemorative cap may be awarded after a player reaches the 100th cap .
ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL Section::::Association football .
As an example , the England men 's association football teams still awards physical caps .
Players are awarded one cap for every match they play — unless they play in a World Cup or European Championship finals tournament .
Then they are given a single cap for the competition — with the names of all their opponents stitched into the fabric of the cap itself .
For example , when David Beckham made his one hundredth appearance for England , because a number of his appearances had been at World Cup and European Championship final tournaments for which he received only one cap , he received only his 85th physical cap .
The world record holder for the highest number of international caps as of 5 November 2010 is retired American player Kristine Lilly , who has 354 caps ( between 1987 and 2010 ) .
In men 's association football , the record belongs to former player Ahmed Hassan of Egypt ; he surpassed Claudio Suárez with his 178th cap on 27 March 2012 .
The first footballer to win 100 international caps was Billy Wright of England 's Wolverhampton Wanderers .
Wright went on to appear 105 times for England , 90 of them he obtained whilst he was a captain .
FIFA rules state that any club that refuses to release a player for national team duty is barred from using the player for two matches , a rule which is intended to discourage clubs from pretending that the player is injured .
However , it is a player 's choice to refuse to play for or retire from his or her national team .

CRICKET
Section::::Cricket .
In cricket , there are two types of caps .
Firstly , there is the international type , as described above .
Some countries also award a domestic type generally known as a " county cap " .
The latter system is most commonly applied in English county cricket .
Most counties do not automatically award caps to players on their first appearance ; instead , they have to be " earned " through good performances .
Indeed , one can play at the highest domestic level for several years , and have a quite significant career in first - class cricket , without ever winning a cap .
RECORDS Section::::Records .
The world record for the number of caps in Test cricket is held by Sachin Tendulkar of India , who has , over the course of a 22-year career , collected 200 .
Tendulkar also holds the record for One Day Internationals , with 463 caps .
