Peacekeeping , as defined by the United Nations , is a way to help countries torn by conflict create conditions for sustainable peace .
UN peacekeepers — usually military officers , civilian police officers and civilian personnel from many countries — monitor and observe peace processes that emerge in post - conflict situations and assist ex - combatants in implementing the peace agreements they have signed .
Such assistance comes in many forms , including confidence - building measures , power - sharing arrangements , electoral support , strengthening the rule of law , and economic and social development .
Pakistan has contributed mainly military , but also paramilitary and civilian police as peacekeepers as well .
All operations must include the resolution of conflicts through the use of force to be considered valid under the charter of the United Nations .
