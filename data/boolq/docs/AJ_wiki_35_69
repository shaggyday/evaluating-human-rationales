ALTITUDE SICKNESS Altitude sickness , the mildest form being acute mountain sickness ( AMS ) , is the negative health effect of high altitude , caused by rapid exposure to low amounts of oxygen at high elevation .
Symptoms may include headaches , vomiting , tiredness , trouble sleeping , and dizziness .
Acute mountain sickness can progress to high altitude pulmonary edema ( HAPE ) with associated shortness of breath or high altitude cerebral edema ( HACE ) with associated confusion .
Chronic mountain sickness may occur after long term exposure to high altitude .
Altitude sickness typically occurs only above , though some are affected at lower altitudes .
Risk factors include a prior episode of altitude sickness , a high degree of activity , and a rapid increase in elevation .
Diagnosis is based on symptoms and is supported in those who have more than a minor reduction in activities .
It is recommended that at high - altitude any symptoms of headache , nausea , shortness of breath , or vomiting be assumed to be altitude sickness .
Prevention is by gradually increasing elevation by no more than per day .
Being physically fit does not decrease the risk .
Treatment is generally by descending to a lower altitude and sufficient fluids .
Mild cases may be helped by ibuprofen , acetazolamide , or dexamethasone .
Severe cases may benefit from oxygen therapy and a portable hyperbaric bag may be used if descent is not possible .
Treatment efforts , however , have not been well studied .
AMS occurs in about 20 % of people after rapidly going to and 40 % of people going to .
While AMS and HACE occurs equally frequently in males and females , HAPE occurs more often in males .
The earliest description of altitude sickness is attributed to a Chinese text from around 30 BCE which describes " Big Headache Mountains " possibly referring to the Karakoram Mountains around Kilik Pass .
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Section::::Signs and symptoms .
People have different susceptibilities to altitude sickness ; for some otherwise healthy people , acute altitude sickness can begin to appear at around above sea level , such as at many mountain ski resorts , equivalent to a pressure of .
This is the most frequent type of altitude sickness encountered .
Symptoms often manifest themselves six to ten hours after ascent and generally subside in one to two days , but they occasionally develop into the more serious conditions .
Symptoms include headache , fatigue , stomach illness , dizziness , and sleep disturbance .
Exertion aggravates the symptoms .
Those individuals with the lowest initial partial pressure of end - tidal pCO ( the lowest concentration of carbon dioxide at the end of the respiratory cycle , a measure of a higher alveolar ventilation ) and corresponding high oxygen saturation levels tend to have a lower incidence of acute mountain sickness than those with high end - tidal pCO and low oxygen saturation levels .
PRIMARY SYMPTOMS Section::::Primary symptoms .
Headaches are the primary symptom used to diagnose altitude sickness , although a headache is also a symptom of dehydration .
A headache occurring at an altitude above a pressure of combined with any one or more of the following symptoms , may indicate altitude sickness : !

Symptoms SEVERE SYMPTOMS
Section::::Severe symptoms .
Symptoms that may indicate life - threatening altitude sickness include : Pulmonary edema ( fluid in the lungs )
Cerebral edema ( swelling of the brain ) :
The most serious symptoms of altitude sickness arise from edema ( fluid accumulation in the tissues of the body ) .
At very high altitude , humans can get either high altitude pulmonary edema ( HAPE ) , or high altitude cerebral edema ( HACE ) .
The physiological cause of altitude - induced edema is not conclusively established .
It is currently believed , however , that HACE is caused by local vasodilation of cerebral blood vessels in response to hypoxia , resulting in greater blood flow and , consequently , greater capillary pressures .
On the other hand , HAPE may be due to general vasoconstriction in the pulmonary circulation ( normally a response to regional ventilation - perfusion mismatches ) which , with constant or increased cardiac output , also leads to increases in capillary pressures .
For those suffering HACE , dexamethasone may provide temporary relief from symptoms in order to keep descending under their own power .
HAPE can progress rapidly and is often fatal .
Symptoms include fatigue , severe dyspnea at rest , and cough that is initially dry but may progress to produce pink , frothy sputum .
Descent to lower altitudes alleviates the symptoms of HAPE .
HACE is a life - threatening condition that can lead to coma or death .
Symptoms include headache , fatigue , visual impairment , bladder dysfunction , bowel dysfunction , loss of coordination , paralysis on one side of the body , and confusion .
Descent to lower altitudes may save those afflicted with HACE .
CAUSE Section::::Cause .
Altitude sickness can first occur at 1,500 metres , with the effects becoming severe at extreme altitudes ( greater than 5,500 metres ) .
Only brief trips above 6,000 metres are possible and supplemental oxygen is needed to avert sickness .
As altitude increases , the available amount of oxygen to sustain mental and physical alertness decreases with the overall air pressure , though the relative percentage of oxygen in air , at about 21 % , remains practically unchanged up to .
The RMS velocities of diatomic nitrogen and oxygen are very similar and thus no change occurs in the ratio of oxygen to nitrogen until stratospheric heights .
Dehydration due to the higher rate of water vapor lost from the lungs at higher altitudes may contribute to the symptoms of altitude sickness .
The rate of ascent , altitude attained , amount of physical activity at high altitude , as well as individual susceptibility , are contributing factors to the onset and severity of high - altitude illness .
Altitude sickness usually occurs following a rapid ascent and can usually be prevented by ascending slowly .
In most of these cases , the symptoms are temporary and usually abate as altitude acclimatization occurs .
However , in extreme cases , altitude sickness can be fatal .
HIGH ALTITUDE Section::::High altitude .
At high altitude , , the onset of physiological effects of diminished inspiratory oxygen pressure ( PiO ) includes decreased exercise performance and increased ventilation ( lower arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide : PCO ) .
While arterial oxygen transport may be only slightly impaired the arterial oxygen saturation ( SaO ) generally stays above 90 % .
Altitude sickness is common between 2,400 and 4,000 m because of the large number of people who ascend rapidly to these altitudes .
VERY HIGH ALTITUDE Section::::Very high altitude .
At very high altitude , , maximum SaO falls below 90 % as the arterial PO falls below 60mmHg .
Extreme hypoxemia may occur during exercise , during sleep , and in the presence of high altitude pulmonary edema or other acute lung conditions .
Severe altitude illness occurs most commonly in this range .
EXTREME ALTITUDE Section::::Extreme altitude .
Above , marked hypoxemia , hypocapnia , and alkalosis are characteristic of extreme altitudes .
Progressive deterioration of physiologic function eventually outstrips acclimatization .
As a result , no permanent human habitation occurs above .
A period of acclimatization is necessary when ascending to extreme altitude ; abrupt ascent without supplemental oxygen for other than brief exposures invites severe altitude sickness .
MECHANISM Section::::Mechanism .
The physiology of altitude sickness centres around the alveolar gas equation ; the atmospheric pressure is low , but there is still 20.9 % Oxygen , water vapour still occupies the same pressure too , this means that there is less oxygen pressure available in the lungs and blood .
Compare these two equations comparing the amount of oxygen in blood at altitude : !

Formula Pressure of oxygen in the alveolus Oxygen Carriage in the blood
The hypoxia leads to an increase in minute ventilation ( hence both low CO , and subsequently bicarbonate ) ,
Hb increases through haemoconcentration and erythrogenesis .
Alkylosis shifts the haemaglobin dissociation constant to the left , 2,3-DPG increases to counter this .
Cardiac output increases through an increase in heart rate .
The body 's response to high altitude includes the following : * ↑ Erythropoietin → ↑ hematocrit and hemoglobin * ↑ 2,3-BPG ( allows ↑ release of O and a right shift on the Hb - O disassociation curve ) * ↑ kidney excretion of bicarbonate ( use of acetazolamide can augment for treatment )
* Chronic hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction ( can cause right ventricular hypertrophy )
People with high - altitude sickness generally have reduced hyperventilator response , impaired gas exchange , fluid retention or increased sympathetic drive .
There is thought to be an increase in cerebral venous volume because of an increase in cerebral blood flow and hypocapnic cerebral vasoconstriction causing oedema .
DIAGNOSIS Section::::Diagnosis .
Diagnosis can be assisted with a number of different scoring systems .
PREVENTION Section::::Prevention .
Ascending slowly is the best way to avoid altitude sickness .
Avoiding strenuous activity such as skiing , hiking , etc .
in the first 24 hours at high altitude reduces the symptoms of AMS .
Alcohol and sleeping pills are respiratory depressants , and thus slow down the acclimatization process and should be avoided .
Alcohol also tends to cause dehydration and exacerbates AMS .
Thus , avoiding alcohol consumption in the first 24–48 hours at a higher altitude is optimal .
PRE - ACCLIMATIZATION Section::::Pre - acclimatization .
Pre - acclimatization is when the body develops tolerance to low oxygen concentrations before ascending to an altitude .
It significantly reduces risk because less time has to be spent at altitude to acclimatize in the traditional way .
Additionally , because less time has to be spent on the mountain , less food and supplies have to be taken up .
Several commercial systems exist that use altitude tents , so called because they mimic altitude by reducing the percentage of oxygen in the air while keeping air pressure constant to the surroundings .
ALTITUDE ACCLIMATIZATION Section::::Altitude acclimatization .
Altitude acclimatization is the process of adjusting to decreasing oxygen levels at higher elevations , in order to avoid altitude sickness .
Once above approximately a pressure of most climbers and high - altitude trekkers take the " climb - high , sleep - low " approach .
For high - altitude climbers , a typical acclimatization regimen might be to stay a few days at a base camp , climb up to a higher camp ( slowly ) , and then return to base camp .
A subsequent climb to the higher camp then includes an overnight stay .
This process is then repeated a few times , each time extending the time spent at higher altitudes to let the body adjust to the oxygen level there , a process that involves the production of additional red blood cells .
Once the climber has acclimatized to a given altitude , the process is repeated with camps placed at progressively higher elevations .
The rule of thumb is to ascend no more than per day to sleep .
That is , one can climb from ( ) to ( ) in one day , but one should then descend back to ( ) to sleep .
This process can not safely be rushed , and this is why climbers need to spend days ( or even weeks at times )
acclimatizing before attempting to climb a high peak .
Simulated altitude equipment such as altitude tents provide hypoxic ( reduced oxygen ) air , and are designed to allow partial pre - acclimation to high altitude , reducing the total time required on the mountain itself .
Altitude acclimatization is necessary for some people who move rapidly from lower altitudes to intermediate altitudes ( e.g. , by aircraft and ground transportation over a few hours ) , such as from sea level to as in many Colorado , USA mountain resorts .
Stopping at an intermediate altitude overnight ( for example , staying overnight when arriving through Denver , at , when traveling to the aforementioned Colorado resorts ) can alleviate or eliminate occurrences of AMS .
MEDICATIONS Section::::Medications .
The drug acetazolamide ( trade name Diamox ) may help some people making a rapid ascent to sleeping altitude above , and it may also be effective if started early in the course of AMS .
Acetazolamide can be taken before symptoms appear as a preventive measure at a dose of 125 mg twice daily .
The Everest Base Camp Medical Centre cautions against its routine use as a substitute for a reasonable ascent schedule , except where rapid ascent is forced by flying into high altitude locations or due to terrain considerations .
The Centre suggests a dosage of 125 mg twice daily for prophylaxis , starting from 24 hours before ascending until a few days at the highest altitude or on descending ; with 250 mg twice daily recommended for treatment of AMS .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) suggest the same dose for prevention of 125 mg acetazolamide every 12 hours .
Acetazolamide , a mild diuretic , works by stimulating the kidneys to secrete more bicarbonate in the urine , thereby acidifying the blood .
This change in pH stimulates the respiratory center to increase the depth and frequency of respiration , thus speeding the natural acclimatization process .
An undesirable side - effect of acetazolamide is a reduction in aerobic endurance performance .
Other minor side effects include a tingle - sensation in hands and feet .
Although a sulfonamide ; acetazolamide is a non - antibiotic and has not been shown to cause life - threatening allergic cross - reactivity in those with a self - reported sulfonamide allergy .
Dosage of 1000 mg / day will produce a 25 % decrease in performance , on top of the reduction due to high - altitude exposure .
The CDC advises that Dexamethasone be reserved for treatment of severe AMS and HACE during descents , and notes that Nifedipine may prevent HAPE .
A single randomized controlled trial found that sumatriptan may help prevent altitude sickness .
Despite their popularity , antioxidant treatments have not been found to be effective medications for prevention of AMS .
Interest in phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as sildenafil has been limited by the possibility that these drugs might worsen the headache of mountain sickness .
A promising possible preventive for altitude sickness is myo - inositol trispyrophosphate ( ITPP ) , which increases the amount of oxygen released by hemoglobin .
Prior to the onset of altitude sickness , ibuprofen is a suggested non - steroidal anti - inflammatory and painkiller that can help alleviate both the headache and nausea associated with AMS .
It has not been studied for the prevention of cerebral edema ( swelling of the brain ) associated with extreme symptoms of AMS .
For centuries , indigenous peoples of the Americas such as the Aymaras of the Altiplano , have chewed coca leaves to try to alleviate the symptoms of mild altitude sickness .
In Chinese and Tibetan traditional medicine , an extract of the root tissue of Radix rhodiola is often taken in order to prevent the same symptoms , though neither of these therapies has been proven effective in clinical study .
OXYGEN ENRICHMENT
Section::::Oxygen enrichment .
In high - altitude conditions , oxygen enrichment can counteract the hypoxia related effects of altitude sickness .
A small amount of supplemental oxygen reduces the equivalent altitude in climate - controlled rooms .
At ( ) , raising the oxygen concentration level by 5 % via an oxygen concentrator and an existing ventilation system provides an effective altitude of ( ) , which is more tolerable for those unaccustomed to high altitudes .
Oxygen from gas bottles or liquid containers can be applied directly via a nasal cannula or mask .
Oxygen concentrators based upon pressure swing adsorption ( PSA ) , VSA , or vacuum - pressure swing adsorption ( VPSA ) can be used to generate the oxygen if electricity is available .
Stationary oxygen concentrators typically use PSA technology , which has performance degradations at the lower barometric pressures at high altitudes .
One way to compensate for the performance degradation is to utilize a concentrator with more flow capacity .
There are also portable oxygen concentrators that can be used on vehicular DC power or on internal batteries , and at least one system commercially available measures and compensates for the altitude effect on its performance up to .
The application of high - purity oxygen from one of these methods increases the partial pressure of oxygen by raising the FiO ( fraction of inspired oxygen ) .
OTHER METHODS
Section::::Other methods .
Increased water intake may also help in acclimatization to replace the fluids lost through heavier breathing in the thin , dry air found at altitude , although consuming excessive quantities ( " over - hydration " ) has no benefits and may cause dangerous hyponatremia .
TREATMENT Section::::Treatment .
The only reliable treatment , and in many cases the only option available , is to descend .
Attempts to treat or stabilize the patient in situ ( at altitude ) are dangerous unless highly controlled and with good medical facilities .
However , the following treatments have been used when the patient 's location and circumstances permit : *
Oxygen may be used for mild to moderate AMS below and is commonly provided by physicians at mountain resorts .
Symptoms abate in 12 to 36 hours without the need to descend .
*
For more serious cases of AMS , or where rapid descent is impractical , a Gamow bag , a portable plastic hyperbaric chamber inflated with a foot pump , can be used to reduce the effective altitude by as much as .
A Gamow bag is generally used only as an aid to evacuate severe AMS patients , not to treat them at altitude .
* Acetazolamide 250 mg twice daily dosing assists in AMS treatment by quickening altitude acclimatization .
A study by the Denali Medical Research Project concluded : " In established cases of acute mountain sickness , treatment with acetazolamide relieves symptoms , improves arterial oxygenation , and prevents further impairment of pulmonary gas exchange . "
* The folk remedy for altitude sickness in Ecuador , Peru and Bolivia is a tea made from the coca plant .
See mate de coca .
* Steroids can be used to treat the symptoms of pulmonary or cerebral edema , but do not treat the underlying AMS .
* Two studies in 2012 showed that Ibuprofen 600 milligrams three times daily was effective at decreasing the severity and incidence of AMS ; it was not clear if HAPE or HACE was affected .
*
Paracetamol ( acetaminophen ) has also shown to be as good as ibuprofen for altitude sickness when tested on climbers ascending Everest .
