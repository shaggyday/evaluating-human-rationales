MOUNTAIN TIME ZONE
The Mountain Time Zone of North America keeps time by subtracting seven hours from Coordinated Universal Time ( UTC ) when standard time is in effect , and by subtracting six hours during daylight saving time ( UTC−6 ) .
The clock time in this zone is based on the mean solar time at the 105th meridian west of the Greenwich Observatory .
In the United States , the exact specification for the location of time zones and the dividing lines between zones is set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations at 49 CFR 71 .
In the United States and Canada , this time zone is generically called Mountain Time ( MT ) .
Specifically , it is Mountain Standard Time ( MST )
when observing standard time , and Mountain Daylight Time ( MDT ) when observing daylight saving time .
The term refers to how the Rocky Mountains , which range from northwestern Canada to the US state of New Mexico , are located almost entirely in the time zone .
In Mexico , this time zone is known as the Zona Pacífico ( Pacific Zone ) .
In the US and Canada , the Mountain Time Zone is to the east of the Pacific Time Zone and to the west of the Central Time Zone .
In some areas , starting in 2007 , the local time changes from MST to MDT at 2 am MST to 3 am MDT on the second Sunday in March and returns at 2 am MDT to 1 am MST on the first Sunday in November .
Sonora in Mexico and most of Arizona in the United States do not observe daylight saving time , and during the spring , summer , and autumn months they are on the same time as Pacific Daylight Time .
The Navajo Nation , most of which lies within Arizona , does observe DST , although the Hopi Nation , as well as some Arizona state offices lying within the Navajo Nation , do not .
The largest city in the Mountain Time Zone is Phoenix , Arizona .
The Phoenix metropolitan area is the largest metropolitan area in the zone ; the next largest metropolitan area that observes Mountain Time is Denver , closely followed by the El Paso – Juárez area .
TV broadcasting in the Mountain Time Zone is typically tape - delayed one hour , so that shows match the broadcast times of the Central Time Zone ( i.e. prime time begins at 7 pm MT following the same order of programming as the Central Time Zone ) .
