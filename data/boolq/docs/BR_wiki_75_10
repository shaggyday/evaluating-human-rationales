ATLANTIC TIME ZONE
The Atlantic Time Zone is a geographical region that keeps standard time — called Atlantic Standard Time ( AST)—by subtracting four hours from Coordinated Universal Time ( UTC ) , resulting in .
During part of the year , some portions of the zone observe daylight saving time , referred to as Atlantic Daylight Time ( ADT ) , by moving their clocks forward one hour to result in .
The clock time in this zone is based on the mean solar time of the 60th meridian west of the Greenwich Observatory .
In Canada , the provinces of New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , and Prince Edward Island are in this zone , though legally they calculate time specifically as an offset of four hours from Greenwich Mean Time
( GMT–4 ) rather than from UTC .
Small portions of Quebec ( eastern Côte - Nord and the Magdalen Islands ) also observe Atlantic Time .
Officially , the entirety of Newfoundland and Labrador observes Newfoundland Standard Time , but in practice Atlantic Time is used in most of Labrador .
No portion of the continental United States currently uses Atlantic Time , although it is used by the territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands .
A number of New England states are considering a regional change to Atlantic Standard Time year - round ( with no observance of daylight saving time ) , even though only a small portion of Maine lies to the east of the 67.5 ° W theoretical extent of this zone .
Florida is in the process of enacting a similar change ; in both cases any changes will need to be approved by the United States Department of Transportation and the United States Congress .

A Massachusetts commission concluded in 2017 that the benefits of changing to Atlantic Standard Time year - round would outweigh the disadvantages , provided that a majority of northeastern states made the same change .
In May 2017 , the Maine Senate approved a change to AST , on the condition that there would be a referendum , and that Massachusetts and New Hampshire decided to make the same switch .
Also in 2017 , the New Hampshire House of Representatives approved a bill in favour of a regional change , but this was voted down by the state 's Senate .
Similar bills have been put forward in Connecticut and Rhode Island .
In Florida , two bills were approved in January 2018 by House and Senate committees , to move most of the state permanently to Atlantic Standard Time ( with the panhandle moving to year - round Eastern Standard Time ) with no observation of daylight saving time .
