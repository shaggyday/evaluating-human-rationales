PUBLICATION HISTORY Section::::Publication history .
Harry Osborn first appeared in The Amazing Spider - Man # 31 ( December 1965 ) , and was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko .
In The Amazing Spider - Man # 122 ( July 1973 ) , Harry 's father , Norman , is killed off , and a subplot leading to Harry Osborn inheriting his father 's identity as the Green Goblin is introduced .
This subplot culminates in The Amazing Spider - Man # 136 ( September 1974 ) .
Writer Gerry Conway said that the idea of Harry Osborn becoming the Green Goblin stemmed in part from a desire to deal with the consequences of the psychedelic drugs
Harry began using in The Amazing Spider - Man # 96 ( May 1971 ) .
Conway said that he had had experience with such drugs himself , and that " with psychedelic drugs , hallucinogens , if they 've been misused , there 's a potential for additional hallucinogenic experiences that are completely beyond your control or volition .
I could imagine Harry getting hit by something like that , in the fragile emotional state following the death of his father , and losing touch with reality , as a result .
Besides , I never had any intention of getting rid of the Green Goblin as a concept forever , so it all came together . "
Harry dies in The Spectacular Spider - Man # 200 ( May 1993 ) .
Artist Sal Buscema said that drawing the final two pages of this issue was a deeply emotional experience for him due to how long he had drawn the character , and felt it was appropriate that writer
J. M. DeMatteis chose not to add any dialogue to those pages .
Several years later , the Spider - Man writers made plans to reveal that the mysterious villain Gaunt was Harry Osborn , who was still alive and had orchestrated the entire " Clone Saga " , but an editorial edict prevented this from coming to fruition .
However , Harry was eventually revived in The Amazing Spider - Man # 545 ( December 2007 ) .
He received an entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update ' 89 # 5 .
FICTIONAL
CHARACTER
BIOGRAPHY
Section::::Fictional character biography .
Harry is the son of Norman Osborn and Emily Lyman .
The circumstances of Harry 's birth weakens Emily , and she dies after a long illness .
Heartbroken , Norman becomes a cold and unloving father ; Norman either contemptuously dismisses Harry or lashes out at him in fury .
As a result , Harry spends much of his life trying desperately to earn his father 's approval .
Upon graduating from high school , he enrolls in Empire State University .
Among the wealthiest students in the school , Harry soon becomes one of the most popular as well , despite his aloof manner .
He has a clique of rich , popular students around him ; one of these is the lovely Gwen Stacy .
Gwen is intrigued by a new student : bookish , studious and painfully - shy Peter Parker .
Harry takes a dislike to Parker ; he resents the attention Gwen pays to Peter , and he assumes that Peter 's standoffishness is snobbery .
After confronting Parker , Harry realizes that Peter is merely shy and is also worried about his ailing aunt May Parker .
Despite this rocky start , Harry and Peter became friends , eventually sharing an apartment .
Harry does not realize that his best friend is the superhero Spider - Man , nor that his father became the supervillain Green Goblin in an accident while attempting to create a super - serum .
Moreover , before he became friends with Harry , Spider - Man was unmasked and captured by Green Goblin .
During the subsequent battle , an electric shock removed all memory of being Green Goblin from Norman 's mind .
Spider - Man then hid all evidence of Norman 's double identity , to keep Harry from being hurt by the revelation .
However , Norman 's Green Goblin persona resurfaces from time to time .
These are difficult times for Harry , as his father 's periodic episodes are unexplainable .
He had experimented with drugs in his teens ; but he escalates his usage , as well as trying ever - harder substances .
This affects his mental stability and his relationships with his friends .
Spider - Man uses this to his advantage during one battle with Green Goblin ; he is able to stop the fight by showing Norman his son 's emaciated condition , brought on by an accidental cocaine overdose .
The sight shocks Norman so much that it brings him back to sanity .
GREEN GOBLIN
Section::::Green Goblin .
Harry is dumped by Mary Jane Watson due to being fed up with his self - destructive lifestyle .
Disconsolate , Harry turns to drugs and suffers an amphetamine overdose .
He survives , but this tragedy , compounded by imminent bankruptcy , drives his father Norman Osborn over the edge .
The elder Osborn kidnaps Gwen as bait for Spider - Man , and then throws her off the George Washington Bridge ( or Brooklyn Bridge ) .
In a vicious battle with Spider - Man , the Green Goblin accidentally impales himself on his own goblin glider .
Harry Osborn secretly witnesses this .
Wanting to protect his father 's identity , he strips Norman Osborn 's body of the Green Goblin costume .
Blaming Spider - Man for his father 's " murder " , Harry , angry and mentally unbalanced , swears vengeance .
Having inherited his father 's company , Harry manages to get the business back in shape .
One day , to his shock , he finds a Spider - Man costume in Peter Parker 's apartment and realizes that his best friend is the man he blames for his father 's death .
Using his father 's old equipment , Harry confronts Peter as the second Green Goblin .
Not wanting to hurt Harry , Peter avoids fighting his old friend .
After Spider - Man is able to thwart Harry 's initial attempt on his life , Harry is knocked unconscious and taken into police custody .
There , he raves that he is the true Green Goblin and Peter Parker is Spider - Man , but is dismissed as a lunatic .
He is put in the care of criminal psychologist Dr. Bart Hamilton to extract the Green Goblin secrets from Harry through hypnosis , and buries the knowledge deep within Harry 's mind .
Hamilton then raids one of Harry 's hideouts and becomes the third Green Goblin .
Meanwhile , Harry is released and considered cured .
He sustains a concussion that makes him forget his knowledge of Spider - Man 's identity and he and Peter rekindle their friendship .
For a while , Harry 's life seems back on track ; his company begins turning profits once more , and he develops a romance with Liz Allan after they meet at the wedding of Betty Brant and Ned Leeds .
Not long after the two are married , and eventually they have their son Normie Osborn named in memory of the boy 's grandfather .
Harry also gives his blessing to the marriage of Peter and Mary Jane Watson .
However , Harry starts regaining his memories when he is blackmailed by the original Hobgoblin ( Roderick Kingsley ) with a package which contains evidence that his father was the original Green Goblin .
When Hobgoblin learns he had raided all of Norman 's hideouts , he leaves Harry alone , knowing he had nothing more to offer him .
Later , Harry is forced to act as Green Goblin a few times , once to defeat the second Hobgoblin ( Jason Macendale ) .
This Hobgoblin is seeking the Goblin Formula that gave the Green Goblin superhuman strength ; Harry is able to defeat him by doubling back during an aerial chase and emptying his entire supply of pumpkin bombs onto Hobgoblin .
Harry even wonders if he could use the Green Goblin persona for a career as a superhero , but Peter convinces him that Green Goblin had too much baggage for such a role .
Harry buries the Green Goblin menace within his mind once more and focuses on his business and family .
DEATH
Section::::Death .
This tranquility is shattered when the aftereffects of the " Inferno " crisis sunder the barrier between Harry 's conscious and subconscious minds .
Once again , he remembers being Green Goblin â€” and his hatred of Spider - Man .
Harry has now convinced himself that Peter Parker resents the Osborns ' " stable family life " due to never having been wanted by his own parents or guardians , when in fact it was the complete opposite .
He uses Peter 's trust in him to capture him , and subjects him to hallucinogenic gases to psychologically torment him .
He finds himself unsatisfied with this revenge , however , and decides to kill Spider - Man .
However , given the opportunity he proves unwilling to kill his best friend .
Harry investigates his father 's old hideouts and notes , and finally uncovers and ingests the formula for the original Green Goblin 's superhuman strength .
He then kidnaps his wife , son , and brother - in - law Mark Raxton , terrorizing them in an old family mansion .
Raxton manages to signal their location to Spider - Man who defeats the Green Goblin and turns him in to the police .
Spider - Man pushes for Harry to get psychiatric treatment from Dr. Ashley Kafka , but he is ultimately transferred to the Vault .
However , the state is unable to put together a sufficient case against Harry , and after just a few weeks in prison , he is released .
Harry discovers that his father developed an advanced version of the Goblin Formula , but was unable to test it before his final battle with Spider - Man .
After testing it , he ingests the new formula .
When he spies Spider - Man investigating his townhouse , Harry loses his temper and attacks him as the Green Goblin .
He injects Peter with a drug that leaves him immobile and , in a fit of depression , activates timed explosives that he had planted throughout the townhouse , planning to kill both himself and Peter .
However , when he realizes that Mary Jane and his son Normie are also in the townhouse , he is shocked back to his normal self .
Harry rescues Mary Jane , Normie , and Peter before he collapses .
He belatedly realizes that he did not test the new formula diligently enough , and that it is , in fact , lethal .
POST - MORTEM Section::::Post - mortem .
Sometime before his death , Harry created a computer system with copies of his and Norman Osborn 's minds programmed into it ; after Harry 's death , the computer system activates and abducts Normie Osborn with the intent of subjecting him to the Green Goblin Serum ( the same one that had caused Harry 's death ) to make into the newest Green Goblin .
This computer facsimile of Harry and its robotic drones ( which resemble female versions of Green Goblin ) were all destroyed by Spider - Man and the Molten Man who manage to save Normie from it .
However , Harry had one last trick up his sleeve .
Sometime before his final confrontation with Spider - Man , Harry had employed the Chameleon to construct Life Model Decoys of Peter 's parents to play with his emotions .
The plot ends with both constructs revealed as fakes when both " die " , shattering Peter 's mind .
After nearly killing the Chameleon , Peter found a tape Harry had left before he died revealing his role in the plot and mocking Peter , demonstrating that Harry was as manipulative and cruel as his father when gripped by insanity .
Peter goes temporarily insane from the shock , even briefly rejecting his identity until the return of his clone Ben Reilly snaps him back to reality .
RETURN FROM THE GRAVE
Section::::Return from the grave .
It is subsequently revealed that Harry 's supposed death is faked by Mysterio and his father who spirits his son away to Europe where he is held prisoner in several " rehab " clinics and believes that his son had relapsed into drug addiction , and this , in turn , led to his brief return to wearing the Green Goblin costume .
At some point , Harry is released from rehab and reunites with his friends .
However , because of the machinations of his father and Mephisto 's warping of reality , erasing the entire world 's knowledge of Spider - Man 's secret ( save for Mary Jane ) , Harry no longer remembers that Peter Parker is Spider - Man .
His marriage to Liz Allan also disintegrates and the two divorce .
Harry engages in a string of relationships , several of which result in Harry marrying and divorcing in rapid fashion .
He is in a relationship with Lily Hollister .
Harry tries to help Lily 's father in the latter 's bid for Mayor of New York by funding her father 's campaign with his dwindling finances .
Harry is also one of the leading suspects for the secret identity of the New Goblin .
In the " New Ways to Die " story arc , Menace battles Norman Osborn and is infuriated when Norman states that all he cares about is killing Spider - Man .
Norman dons the Green Goblin costume and mentions that Harry has been in the Green Goblin 's lair .
Norman calls Harry , who realizes from Norman 's distorted voice that Norman is wearing the Green Goblin suit .
This horrifies and disgusts Harry , who vows to stop his father .
Harry angrily confronts his father , who wants Harry to follow his legacy and become a greater man .
The confused Harry is saved by Spider - Man .
Spider - Man , who wants to beat Norman senseless , stops when he sees an area for human testing .
Harry is claimed to be the one responsible for the atrocious acts , although he attempts to plead innocence .
Harry later states that he wants to talk to Peter , who moments earlier was kissed by Lily , and is seen leaving with a mysterious canister labelled " Prometheus
X-90 " .
Prometheus X-90 , it is revealed later , was developed as a successful cure for Mark Raxton 's condition as Molten Man .
The only human test subject was Charlie Weiderman , the short - lived second Molten Man , and the only person on whom the serum could be tested .
After the cure is administered , Liz finally forgives Harry and gives him back the wedding ring , which she originally claimed she lost .
Renting out all of Liberty Island , Harry takes Lily there and , at the top of the Statue of Liberty , he gets down on one knee and proposes to her .
Lily rejects his proposal because she is not sure where their relationship will lead , which surprises Harry .
He later goes to her place to check up on her , and as he enters the room he is surprised to discover Lily wearing the Menace costume .
She found a hidden door in his closet and one of his old journals .
She begins giving him a hard time about whining so much about his father .
Harry thinks her behavior is because she is sick .
She continues to tell him she uncovered one of Norman 's secret rooms described in the journal .
This explains why she kissed Peter after the Thunderbolts attacked ; he almost found the secret trigger to open the room .
When she first entered the room , she found the Green Goblin 's equipment and some experiments .
Knocking over some chemicals , she absorbed them and is now able to transform at will .
She explains that she discovered Menace 's attacks against her father gives him more public support .
She also tells him that she accepts his marriage proposal .
After their talk , Harry enters one of his father 's weapons caches , takes a glider ( filled with bombs and winged bombs ) , a pair of Goblin gloves , a sword , and a dart gun containing an unknown chemical .
In the midst of a battle between Menace and Spider - Man , Harry confronts and shoots her with that chemical , which is a type of antidote that reverts her back to her human form .
He saves Spider - Man from the crowd and leaves .
Lily is incarcerated but later escapes , leaving Harry her ring and a note .

Disabling the camera in his room , Harry sneaks off .
He finds a cure for Lily 's condition that will be safe for both Lily and the baby , but Lily pushes him away .
Lily reveals that it is a ruse to coerce Harry into taking on the American Son armor , whom Norman had plotted would die in a tragedy to increase sympathy for Norman and the Dark Avengers .
Lily also reveals that the baby is not Harry 's but , in fact , Norman 's .
In retaliation for this , Harry dons his American Son armor , and fights Norman in his Iron Patriot armor .
During the battle , Norman declares that Harry is no longer his son , and that Norman has bred a better child to replace the ' failure ' of Harry .
After further taunts from Norman , Harry lashes out and defeats his father , declaring " I was never your son ! " .
When Harry has the option of killing Norman , Spider - Man tells him to decapitate Norman , since his father 's healing factor may repair a blow to the head .
Spider - Man also cautions Harry that killing Norman will cause Harry to " become the son Norman always wanted " .
Seeing what he may become with his actions , Harry instead backs down , and turns away from his father forever .
Harry is next seen in a psychiatrist 's office , claiming to be getting over the effects of a medical treatment he received .
The doctor offers to prescribe him oxycodone
but it is not revealed if Harry takes the prescription .
Afterwards , Harry is cut off financially and is forced out of his penthouse apartment .
He moves into Peter 's old room at May Parker 's .
