BACARDI 151 Bacardi 151 is a discontinued brand of highly alcoholic rum made by Bacardi Limited of Hamilton , Bermuda .
It is named for its alcohol proof level of 151 , that is , 75.5 % alcohol by volume .
This is much higher than typical rum at 35%–40 % .
Bacardi 151 was sold in the US from at least 1963 until 2016 , when its production was discontinued .
FLAMMABILITY AND SAFETY Section::::Flammability and safety .
As with all high - alcohol beverages , Bacardi 151 is flammable .
Bacardi 151 has multiple warnings on the label of the bottle stating that it should not be ignited or exposed to an open flame .
Bottles are also equipped with a stainless steel flame arrester crimped onto the neck of the bottle to prevent the rum inside the bottle from igniting , in case a consumer ignores the warnings and applies the rum to a source of ignition ( e.g. a flaming pan or dish , a flambé ) .
Despite the warnings against ignition and the flame arrester , consumers have claimed to have been burned by people who ignored repeated warnings , removed the flame arrester , and exposed the bottle to an open flame .
