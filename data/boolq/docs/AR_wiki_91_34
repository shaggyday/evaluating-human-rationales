TWO POUNDS ( BRITISH COIN )
The British two pound ( £ 2 ) coin is a denomination of the pound sterling .
Its obverse has featured the profile of Queen Elizabeth II since the coin 's introduction .
Three different portraits of the Queen have been used , with the current design by Jody Clark being introduced in 2015 .
The reverse design features Britannia .
The coin was introduced on 15 June 1998 ( coins minted 1997 ) after a review of the United Kingdom 's coinage
decided that a general - circulation £ 2 coin was needed .
The new bi - metallic coin design replaced a series of commemorative , uni - metallic coins which were issued between 1986 and 1996 to celebrate special occasions .
Although legal tender , these coins have never been common in everyday circulation .
As of March 2014 there were an estimated 417 million £ 2 coins in circulation with an estimated face value of £ 834 million .
DESIGN Section::::Design .
The original reverse of the coin , designed by Bruce Rushin , is an abstract design symbolising the history of technological achievement , accompanied by the words above , and the year of minting below .
This was the first bi - metallic coin to be produced for circulation in Britain since the tin farthing with a copper plug produced in 1692 , and is the highest denomination coin in common circulation in the UK .
The coin consists of an outer yellow metal nickel - brass ring made from 76 % copper , 20 % zinc , and 4 % nickel , and an inner steel - coloured cupro - nickel disc made from 75 % copper , 25 % nickel .
The coin weighs and is in diameter .
The design itself was first tried out in 1994 when the Royal Mint produced a short run of demonstration pieces to the new bi - metal standard .
These pieces were not for circulation and were simply intended to test the manufacturing process .
The coin was technically similar to the version which eventually entered circulation with the Maklouf effigy of Queen Elizabeth II on the obverse and the image of a sailing ship similar to that previously used on the reverse of the pre - decimal halfpenny piece .
The inscription on the reverse read with an edge inscription based on the one pound coin which read , meaning " An ornament and a safeguard – [ in the ] 46th year of [ her ] reign " .
The 1994 pieces were never legal tender but were eventually released for sale as part of a presentation set in 1998 .
At the same time in 1994 the Royal Mint produced a mono - metallic trial two - pound coin , with the same ship reverse and inscription , but otherwise similar to the earlier commemorative coins .
These were never issued in presentation sets , and so are much scarcer than the bi - metallic version .
Because of technical difficulties , the 1997-dated coins , which bear the effigy of Queen Elizabeth II by Raphael Maklouf , were not released to circulation until June 1998 ( the same time as the 1998-dated coins ) .
1998 and later dated coins bear the effigy of the Queen by Ian Rank - Broadley .
The Maklouf - effigy coins bear the inscription on the obverse ; the Rank - Broadley coins bear the inscription .
The reverse of the regular - issue coin , designed by Bruce Rushin , bears a concentric design symbolically representing technological development from the Iron Age , through the Industrial Revolution and the Electronic Age to the Internet , with the inscription above the design and the date below .
An oddity of the design is that it depicts nineteen interlocking gears .
Because there is an odd number of them , the mechanism could not actually turn .
The coin has the edge inscription , a quote taken from a letter by Isaac Newton to Robert Hooke , in which he describes how his work was built on the knowledge of those that had gone before him .
" If I have seen further , it is by standing on the shoulders of giants . "
( Newton was Warden and later Master of the Royal Mint . )
In February 2015 , the Royal Mint announced a new design featuring Britannia by Antony Dufort replacing the previous design .
The new coins will feature the edge inscription , meaning " I will claim the four seas " , an inscription previously featured on coins bearing the image of Britannia .
The comparative rarity of the Maklouf - effigy coins has led to an urban myth that they are much more valuable than the other coins , but this is not true – there were over 13 million 1997-dated £ 2 coins issued .
Another urban myth about the coin is that putting it in the freezer overnight causes the cupro - nickel centre to pop out , a claim which had been true of some early mintings of the similarly bimetallic Canadian 2 dollar coin .
VARIANTS Section::::Variants .
In addition to the standard designs there have been several variant reverse designs used on the £ 2 coin to commemorate important events .
