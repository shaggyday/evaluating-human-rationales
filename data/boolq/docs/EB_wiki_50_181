* 5—Curtis Staples * 44—Sean Singletary RIVALRIES LOUISVILLE CARDINALS Section::::Rivalries . Section::::Louisville Cardinals .
Following conference realignment , the Cardinals moved from the Big East to the ACC and were designated UVA 's rival , replacing Maryland .
While the two schools had little previous history , having met only 8 times prior to becoming conference rivals , the series has been characterized by tight games and blowouts since 2014 .
The rivalry has taken on a similar feel to the old Maryland series , as both teams have acted as spoilers to the other with a Cardinal win in 2015 and a 2017 Cavalier win delaying or preventing an ACC regular season title , while an injury to star player Justin Anderson during the 2015 matchup derailed UVA 's national championship aspirations .
The March 2018 matchup between the two teams ended with Virginia scoring 5 points in the final 0.9 seconds and dealing what proved to be a mortal blow to Louisville 's NCAA tournament hopes .
Virginia leads the all - time series 11 - 4 .
The most recent matchup was a 75–58 Virginia win in the ACC Tournament on March 8 , 2018 .
MARYLAND TERRAPINS Section::::Maryland Terrapins .
Thanks to the proximity of these two long - time ACC members , and their status as Tobacco Road outsiders , Maryland and Virginia have a long - standing rivalry that spans many decades .
Traditionally , these two schools would meet in the last game of the season , and they both acted as spoilers to the other as they sought conference championships and NCAA tournament appearances .
This rivalry has been dormant in recent years however , thanks to Maryland 's move to the Big Ten Conference , though they did match up in the 2018 ACC - Big Ten Challenge .
The most recent matchup was 76 - 71 win for the Cavaliers on November 28 , 2018 in College Park , Maryland .
NORTH CAROLINA
TAR
HEELS
Section::::North Carolina Tar Heels .
As two of the ACC 's oldest and most successful members , the UVA - UNC rivalry spans all sports and has persisted since the late 1800s .
The 1980s were a particular highlight for this series as All - time greats like Ralph Sampson and Michael Jordan leading both programs to national prominence .
While the Tar Heels have a significant lead in the All - Time series , the resurgence of both programs under Roy Williams and Tony Bennett has rekindled this once - fierce rivalry , as both schools have regularly found themselves at or near the top of national and conference polls during the 2010s .
The most recent matchup came in the ACC Tournament championship on March 10 , 2018 , where Virginia beat UNC 71 - 63 .
VIRGINIA TECH HOKIES Section::::Virginia Tech Hokies .
As the two Power Conference teams in the Commonwealth , the Cavaliers and Hokies have a long - standing rivalry .
While the intensity has picked up since Virginia Tech joined the ACC in 2004 , the series has long been dominated by UVA , with the Cavaliers leading the series 91 - 55 ( .623 winning percentage ) .
The most recent matchup occurred at John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville , with UVA falling in overtime 61 - 60 on February 10 , 2018 .
