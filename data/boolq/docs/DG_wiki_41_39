The dominion , jurisdiction , and sovereignty of the islands have variously been the subject of a colonial land grant , a provincial governor 's directive , and an interstate compact , as well as several court cases and U.S. Supreme Court decisions .
Liberty Island and the acreage on Ellis Island are part of New York City which are completely surrounded by the municipal borders of Jersey City , including created by land reclamation at Ellis Island and riparian areas .
