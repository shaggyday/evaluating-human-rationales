ALPINE FAULT
The Alpine Fault is a geological fault , specifically a right - lateral strike - slip fault , that runs almost the entire length of New Zealand 's South Island .
It forms a transform boundary between the Pacific Plate and the Indo - Australian Plate .
Earthquakes along the fault , and the associated earth movements , have formed the Southern Alps .
The uplift to the southeast of the fault is due to an element of convergence between the plates , meaning that the fault has a significant high - angle reverse oblique component to its displacement .
In 1941 Harold Wellman discovered the true extent of the Alpine Fault and correctly identified its 480 km lateral offset of New Zealand 's basement terranes .
Uplift on the Alpine Fault has lead to the exposure of deep metamorphic rocks near the fault within the Southern Alps .
This includes mylonites and the Alpine Schist , which increases in metamorphic grade towards the fault .
The Alpine Fault is believed to align with the Macquarie Fault Zone in the Puysegur Trench off the southwestern corner of the South Island .
From there , the Alpine Fault runs along the western edge of the Southern Alps , before splitting into a set of smaller dextral strike - slip faults north of Arthur 's Pass , known as the Marlborough Fault System .
This set of faults , which includes the Wairau Fault , the Hope Fault , the Awatere Fault , and the Clarence Fault , transfer displacement between the Alpine Fault and the Hikurangi subduction zone to the north .
The Hope fault is thought to represent the primary continuation of the Alpine fault .
Average slip rates in the fault 's central region are about 30 mm a year , very fast by global standards .
MAJOR RUPTURES Section::::Major ruptures .
Over the last thousand years , there have been four major ruptures along the Alpine Fault causing earthquakes of about magnitude 8 .
These had previously been determined to have occurred in approximately 1100 , 1430 , 1620 and 1717 CE , at intervals between 100 and 350 years .
The 1717 quake appears to have involved a rupture along nearly of the southern two - thirds of the fault .
Scientists say that a similar earthquake could happen at any time as the interval since 1717 is longer than between the earlier events .
Newer research carried out by the University of Otago and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation revised the dates of the pre-1717 earthquakes to between 1535 and 1596 ( instead of 1620 ) , 1374 and 1405 ( instead of 1430 ) , and 1064 and 1120 ( instead of 1100 ) .
In addition , an earlier earthquake was identified to have occurred between 887 and 965 .
In 2012 , GNS Science researchers published an 8000-year timeline of 24 major earthquakes on the ( southern end of the ) fault from sediments at Hokuri Creek , near Lake McKerrow in north Fiordland .
In earthquake terms , the long fault is remarkably consistent , rupturing on average every 330 years , at intervals ranging from 140 years to 510 years .
In 2017 , GNS researchers revised the figures after they combined updated Hokuri site records with a thousand year record from another site 20 km away at John O'Groats River to produce a record of 27 major earthquake events during the 8000-year period .
This gave a mean recurrence rate of 291 years , plus or minus 23 years , down from the previously estimated rate of 329 years , plus or minus 26 years .
In the new study , the interval between earthquakes ranged from 160 to 350 years and the probability of an earthquake occurring in the following 50 years was estimated at 29 per cent .
Large ruptures can also trigger earthquakes on the faults continuing north from the Alpine Fault .
There is paleotsunami evidence of near - simultaneous ruptures of the Alpine fault and Wellington ( and/or other major ) faults to the North having occurred at least twice in the past 1,000 years .
EFFECTS OF
ALPINE FAULT RUPTURE
Section::::Effects of Alpine Fault rupture .
A 2018 study says that a significant rupture in the Alpine Fault could lead to roads ( particularly in or to the West Coast ) being blocked for months , as with the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake , with problems in supplying towns and evacuating tourists .
EARTHQUAKES IN HISTORIC TIMES Section::::Earthquakes in historic times .
The Alpine Fault and its northern offshoots have experienced sizable earthquakes in historic times : * 1848 –
Marlborough , estimated magnitude = 7.5 * 1888 –
North Canterbury , estimated magnitude =
7.3 * 1929 –
Arthur 's Pass , estimated magnitude = 7.1 * 1929 – Murchison , estimated magnitude = 7.8 * 1968 – Inangahua , estimated magnitude = 7.1 * 2003 – Fiordland , estimated magnitude = 7.1 * 2009 – Fiordland , estimated magnitude = 7.8 HYDROTHERMAL ACTIVITY
Section::::Hydrothermal activity .
In 2017 scientists reported they had discovered beneath Whataroa , a small township on the Alpine Fault , " extreme " hydrothermal activity which " could be commercially very significant " .
