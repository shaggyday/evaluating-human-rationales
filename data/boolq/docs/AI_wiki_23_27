LINE - ITEM VETO IN THE UNITED STATES
In United States government , the line - item veto , or partial veto , is the power of an executive authority to nullify or cancel specific provisions of a bill , usually a budget appropriations bill , without vetoing the entire legislative package .
The line - item vetoes are usually subject to the possibility of legislative override as are traditional vetoes .
GOVERNORS Section::::Governors .
Forty - four states — with Indiana , Nevada , New Hampshire , North Carolina , Rhode Island , and Vermont as the only states that do not grant such powers — give their governors some form of line - item veto power .
The Mayor of Washington , D.C. also has this power .
WISCONSIN
Section::::Wisconsin .
The Governor of Wisconsin is empowered with a sweeping line - item veto .
Wisconsin governors have the power to strike out words , numbers , and even entire sentences from appropriations bills .
According to scholars , Wisconsin has used four types of extraordinary partial vetoes .
The first , the " digit veto " , was first used by Governor Patrick Lucey in 1973 .
In appropriation for $ 25 million , he vetoed the digit 2 , resulting in an appropriation of $ 5 million .
Just two years later , Lucey introduced the " editing veto " .
In this instance , the word " not " was removed in the phrase " not less than 50 percent " , thus resulting in the opposite effect than desired by the legislature .
In 1983 , an even more extreme version , the " pick - a - letter " or " Vanna White veto " was introduced .
Governor Anthony Earl edited a 121-word , five - sentence paragraph down to a one - sentence , 22-word paragraph to change an appeals process from the courts to the Public Service Commission .
The final version , the " reduction veto " , was introduced in 1993 by Governor Tommy Thompson .
This resulted in a legislatively - appropriated amount being reduced arbitrarily by the governor .
This unprecedented usage has resulted in eight lawsuits and numerous amendment proposals .
In the first lawsuit , State ex . rel .
Wisconsin Telephone Co. v. Henry , the Wisconsin Supreme Court granted absolute partial veto power to the Governor as long as a workable , complete law remained , stating the governor had " the right to pass independently on every separable piece of legislation in an appropriation bill . "
In his first two terms as governor , Thompson used 1,500 line - item vetoes to cancel a total of $ 150 million in spending ; none of these vetoes were overridden .
The only judicial limitation was Risser v. Klauser , which prohibited the " reduction veto " , stating that " the constitution prohibits a writein veto of monetary figures which are not appropriation amounts .
"
In 2009 , a constitutional amendment was passed abolishing the " Vanna White veto " .
Yet , in 2011 , Governor Scott Walker controversially crossed out 116 words in a pension - related section of the budget bill .
CONFEDERATE STATES Section::::Confederate States .
Article 1 , Section 7 of the Confederate States Constitution , adopted just before the start of the American Civil War , would have granted the President of the Confederate States the ability to " approve any appropriation and disapprove any other appropriation in the same bill , " with such disapprovals returned to the Houses of Congress for reconsideration and potentially for override .
LINE - ITEM VETO ACT OF 1996
Section::::Line - Item Veto Act of 1996 .
Presidents of the United States have repeatedly asked the Congress to give them a line - item veto power .
According to Louis Fisher in The Politics of Shared Power , Ronald Reagan said to Congress in his 1986 State of the Union address , " Tonight I ask you to give me what forty - three governors have : Give me a line - item veto this year .
Give me the authority to veto waste , and I 'll take the responsibility , I 'll make the cuts , I 'll take the heat . "
Bill Clinton echoed the request in his State of the Union address in 1995 .
Congress attempted to grant this power to the president by the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 to control " pork barrel spending " , but in 1998 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the act to be unconstitutional in a 6 - 3 decision in Clinton v. City of New York .
The court found that exercise of the line - item veto is tantamount to a unilateral amendment or repeal by the executive of only parts of statutes authorizing federal spending , and therefore violated the Presentment Clause of the United States Constitution .
Thus a federal line - item veto , at least in this particular formulation , would only be possible through a constitutional amendment .
Prior to that ruling , President Clinton applied the line - item veto to the federal budget 82 times .
SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENTS Section::::Subsequent developments .
Though the Supreme Court struck down the Line - Item Veto Act in 1998 , President George W. Bush asked the Congress to enact legislation that would return the line - item veto power to the Executive Authority .
First announcing his intent to seek such legislation in his January 31 , 2006 State of the Union address , President Bush sent a legislative proposal , the Legislative Line - Item Veto Act of 2006 , to the Congress on March 6 , 2006 , urging its prompt passage .
Senators Bill Frist ( R - TN ) and John McCain ( R - AZ ) , and Republican Whip Senator Mitch McConnell ( KY ) jointly introduced this proposal .
Representative Paul Ryan ( R - WI ) introduced his own version , the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 , in March of that year .
On that same day , Joshua Bolten , the Director of the Office of Management and Budget , gave a press conference on the President 's line - item veto proposal .
Bolten explained that the proposed Act would give the President the ability to single out " wasteful " spending and to put such spending on hold .
While the spending line - item is on hold , the President can send legislation to Congress to withdraw the particular line - item .
The proposal would then be considered in both houses within ten days on an up or down basis , and could be passed by a simple majority .
Additionally , such proposals could not be filibustered .
When asked how this proposed legislation was different from the 1996 Line - Item Veto Act that the United States Supreme Court had declared illegal , Bolten said that whereas the former act granted unilateral authority to the Executive to disallow specific spending line items , the new proposal would seek Congressional approval of such line - item vetoes .
Thus , for the President to successfully withdraw previously enacted spending , a simple majority of Congress is required to agree to specific legislation to that effect .
Though the 2006 line - item veto proposal was much weaker than the 1996 version , it nevertheless failed to find strong support in the Congress .
Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia , called it " an offensive slap at Congress " , asserting that the legislation would enable the President to intimidate individual members of any Congress by targeting the projects of his political opponents .
He also complained that the line - item veto as proposed would take away the Congress 's constitutional " power of the purse " and give it to the executive branch .
On June 8 , 2006 , Viet D. Dinh , Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center , and Nathan Sales , John M. Olin Fellow at Georgetown University Law Center , testified by written statement before the House Committee on the Budget on the constitutional issues in connection with the proposed legislation .
Dinh and Sales argued that the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 satisfies the Constitution 's Bicameralism and Presentment Clause , and therefore avoids the constitutional issues raised in the 1996 Act struck down by the Supreme Court .
They also stated that the proposed Act is consistent with the basic principle that grants the Congress broad discretion to establish procedures to govern its internal operations .
H.R. 4890 , the Legislative Line - Item Veto Act , was approved by the House Budget Committee on June 14 , 2006 by a vote of 24 - 9 .
It was approved in the full House on June 22 .
A similar version was included in the " Stop Over Spending Act of 2006 " , authored by Senator Judd Gregg , in the Senate and approved by the Senate Budget Committee , but the full Senate failed to approve it , thereby preventing the Legislative Line - Item Veto Act from becoming law .
LINE ITEM VETO RE - ENACTMENT ACTIVITY OF 2009 Section::::Line Item Veto Re - Enactment Activity of 2009 .
In 2009 , Senators Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) and John McCain introduced legislation of a limited version of the line - item veto .
This bill would give the president the power to withdraw earmarks in new bills by sending the bill back to Congress minus the line - item vetoed earmark .
Congress would then vote on the line - item vetoed bill with a majority vote under fast track rules to make any deadlines the bill had .
DEBATE Section::::Debate .
Some scholars , such as Louis Fisher , believe the line - item veto would give presidents too much power over government spending compared with the power of the Congress .
