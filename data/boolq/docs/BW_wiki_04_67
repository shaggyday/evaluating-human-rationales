WHAT
A WONDERFUL
WORLD
" What a Wonderful World " is a pop ballad written by Bob Thiele ( as " George Douglas " ) and George David Weiss .
It was first recorded by Louis Armstrong and released in 1967 as a single , which topped the pop charts in the United Kingdom .
Thiele and Weiss were both prominent in the music world ( Thiele as a producer and Weiss as a composer / performer ) .
Armstrong 's recording was inducted in the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999 .
The publishing for this song is controlled by Memory Lane Music Group , Carlin Music Corp. and BMG Rights Management .
HISTORY Section::::History .
One source claims the song was initially offered to Tony Bennett , who turned it down , although Louis Armstrong biographer Ricky Riccardi disputes this claim .
The song was offered to Louis Armstrong .
George Weiss recounts in the book Off the Record :
Songwriters on Songwriting by Graham Nash that he wrote the song specifically for Louis Armstrong .
Weiss was inspired by Armstrong 's ability to bring people of different races together .
The song was not initially a hit in the United States , where it sold fewer than 1,000 copies because ABC Records head Larry Newton did not like the song and therefore did not promote it , but was a major success in the United Kingdom , reaching number one on the UK Singles Chart .
In the United States , the song hit No . 16 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Chart .
It was also the biggest - selling single of 1968 in the UK where it was among the last pop singles issued by HMV Records before becoming an exclusive classical music label .
The song made Louis Armstrong the oldest male to top the UK Singles Chart .
Armstrong 's record was broken in 2009 when a remake of " Islands in the Stream " recorded for Comic Relief — which included the 68-year - old Tom Jones —
reached number one in that chart .
Tony Bennett did go on to record "
What A Wonderful World " several times , as in 2003 with k.d . lang , paying homage to Bennett 's friend , Armstrong .
ABC Records ' European distributor EMI forced ABC to issue a What a Wonderful World album in 1968 ( catalogue number ABCS-650 ) .
It did not chart in the United States , due to ABC not promoting it , but charted in the UK where it was issued by Stateside Records with catalogue number SSL 10247 and peaked on the British chart at No . 37 .
The song gradually became something of a standard and reached a new level of popularity .
In 1978 , it was featured in the closing scenes of BBC radio 's cult hit , The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy , and was repeated for BBC 's 1981 TV adaptation of the series .
In 1988 , Armstrong 's recording appeared in the film Good Morning , Vietnam ( despite the film being set in 1965 — two years before it was recorded ) and was re - released as a single , hitting No . 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in February 1988 .
The single charted at number one for the fortnight ending June 27 , 1988 on the Australian chart .
It is also the closing song for the 1995 movie 12 Monkeys .
In 2001 , rappers Ghostface Killah , Raekwon and The Alchemist released " The Forest , " a song that begins with three lines of lyric adapted from " What a Wonderful World " , altered to become " an invitation to get high " on marijuana .
The rappers and their record company , Sony Music Entertainment , were sued by the owners of " What a Wonderful World , " Abilene Music .
The suit was thrown out of court after Judge Gerard E. Lynch determined that the altered lyric was indisputably a parody , transforming the uplifting original message to a new one with a darker nature .
By April 2014 , Louis Armstrong 's 1967 recording had sold 2,173,000 downloads in the United States after it was released digitally .

VERSION Section::::Eva Cassidy and Katie Melua version .
In 2007 , Georgian - British singer - songwriter Katie Melua recorded a version of the song with American singer and guitarist Eva Cassidy , who had passed away in 1996 .
Recorded by Melua singing over the original Cassidy track , the duet was released in late 2007 as a charity single for the British Red Cross .
Melua , who considers Cassidy one of her musical idols , had previously sung with Cassidy in this manner on Christmas Eve 2006 , when she performed " Over the Rainbow " on the BBC One television program Duets Impossible with a videotape of Cassidy singing the song .
Upon release , the single debuted at number 45 on the Scottish Singles Chart on the week of December 9 , 2007 .
The next week , the song rose 44 positions to number one while also debuting at number one on the UK Singles Chart , becoming both Cassidy 's and Melua 's first number - one single in the United Kingdom .
However , the song quickly dropped off the UK chart after peaking , spending only five weeks in the UK top 100 .
In Scotland , the song stayed in the top 100 for 11 weeks .
In November 2008 , the song peaked at number 19 in Sweden and was a minor hit in Walloon Belgium .
When the song reached number one in the UK , Melua thanked everyone who bought the single , saying , " Thank you to everyone who has shown such festive goodwill .
" The duet was later included on her 2008 compilation album The Katie Melua Collection .
