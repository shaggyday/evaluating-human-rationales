ARE YOU THE ONE ?
Are You the One ? , sometimes abbreviated as AYTO ? , is an American reality television series on MTV , in which young singles try to find love .
A group of men and women are secretly paired into male - female couples by producers , via a matchmaking algorithm .
Then , while living together , the contestants try to identify all of these " perfect matches .
" If they succeed , the entire group shares a prize of up to $ 1 million .
Over the course of each season , the contestants have the opportunity to pair up in different combinations to compete against each other to win dates , as well as the opportunity to learn in the " truth booth " if a given couple is a correct match .
At the end of each episode , the contestants pair up in a " matching ceremony " and learn how many perfect matches they have , but not which matches are correct .
From season 3 onward , the prize was reduced any time that the house failed to identify any matches other than those already confirmed via the truth booth .
On March 22 , 2017 , spin - off Are You The One : Second Chances premiered .
10 perfect matches from previous seasons returned to compete in tasks designed to test the strength of their bonds .
Each week , teams could add to their potential winnings , but individual contestants had the opportunity to take their team 's winnings from their partner and remove their team from the game .
