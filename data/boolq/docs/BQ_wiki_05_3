ICE RINK
An ice rink ( or ice skating rink ) is a frozen body of water and/or hardened chemicals where people can ice skate or play winter sports .
Besides recreational ice skating , some of its uses include ice hockey , bandy , rink bandy , ringette , broomball , speed skating , figure skating , ice stock sport and curling as well as exhibitions , contests and ice shows .
There are two types of rinks in prevalent use today : natural , where freezing occurs from cold ambient temperatures , and artificial ( or mechanically frozen ) , where a coolant produces cold temperatures in the surface below the water , causing the water to freeze .
There are also synthetic ice rinks where skating surfaces are made out of plastics .
ETYMOLOGY Section::::Etymology .
Rink , a Scottish word meaning ' course ' , was used as the name of a place where curling was played .
The name has been retained for the construction of ice areas for other sports and uses .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Early attempts at the construction of artificial ice rinks were first made in the ' rink mania ' of 1841–44 .
As the technology for the maintenance of natural ice did not exist , these early rinks used a substitute consisting of a mixture of hog 's lard and various salts .
An item in the 8 May 1844 issue of Eliakim Littell 's Living Age headed " The Glaciarium " reported that " This establishment , which has been removed to Grafton street East ' Tottenham Court Road , was opened on Monday afternoon .
The area of artificial ice is extremely convenient for such as may be desirous of engaging in the graceful and manly pastime of skating " .
By 1844 , these venues fell out of fashion , as customers grew tired of the ' smelly ' ice substitute , and it was only thirty years later , that refrigeration technology developed to the point that natural ice could finally be feasibly used in the rink .
The world 's first mechanically frozen ice rink was the Glaciarium , opened by John Gamgee in a tent in a small building just off the Kings Road in Chelsea , London , on 7 January 1876 .
In March , it moved to a permanent venue at 379 Kings Road , where a rink measuring was established .
The rink was based on a concrete surface , with layers of earth , cow hair and timber planks .
Atop these were laid oval copper pipes carrying a solution of glycerine with ether , nitrogen peroxide and water .
The pipes were covered by water and the solution was pumped through , freezing the water into ice .
Gamgee discovered the process while attempting to develop a method to freeze meat for import from Australia and New Zealand , and patented it as early as 1870 .
Gamgee operated the rink on a membership - only basis and attempted to attract a wealthy clientele , experienced in open - air ice skating during winters in the Alps .
He installed an orchestra gallery , which could also be used by spectators , and decorated the walls with views of the Swiss Alps .
The rink initially proved a success , and Gamgee opened two further rinks later in the year : at Rusholme in Manchester and the " Floating Glaciarium " at Charing Cross in London , this last significantly larger at .
The Southport Glaciarium opened in 1879 , using Gamgee 's method .
In Germany , the first ice skating rink opened in 1882 in Frankfurt during a patent exhibition .
It covered 520 m and operated for two months ; the refrigeration system was designed by Linde , and it was probably the first skating rink where Ammonia was used as a refrigerant .
Ten years later , a larger rink was permanently installed on the same site .
The oldest indoor artificial ice rink still in existence ( built 1909 - 10 ) and in use
is the one in Boston 's Matthews Arena , on the campus of Northeastern University .
TYPES NATURAL ICE Section::::Types .
Section::::Natural ice .
Many ice rinks consist of , or are found on , open bodies of water such as lakes , ponds , canals , and sometimes rivers ; these can only be used in the winter in climates where the surface would freeze thickly enough to support human weight .
Rinks can also be made in cold climates by enclosing a level area of ground , filling it with water , and letting it freeze .
Snow may even be packed to use as a containment material .
A famous example of this type of rink is the Rideau Canal Skateway in Ottawa , Ontario , Canada , estimated at and long , which is equivalent to 90 Olympic size skating rinks .
The rink is prepared by lowering the canal 's water level and letting the canal water freeze .
The rink is then resurfaced nightly by cleaning the ice of snow and flooding it with water from below the ice .
The rink is recognized as the " world 's largest naturally frozen ice rink " by the Guinness Book of World Records because " its entire length receives daily maintenance such as sweeping , ice thickness checks and there are toilet and recreational facilities along its entire length " .
The longest ice skating trail can be found in Invermere , British Columbia , Canada , on Lake Windermere Whiteway .
The naturally frozen trail measures .
ARTIFICIAL ICE Section::::Artificial ice .
In any climate , an arena ice surface can be installed in a properly built space .
This consists of a bed of sand or occasionally a slab of concrete , through ( or on top of ) which pipes run .
The pipes carry a chilled fluid ( usually either a salt brine or water with antifreeze , or in the case of smaller rinks , refrigerant ) which can lower the temperature of the slab so that water placed atop will freeze .
This method is known as ' artificial ice ' to differentiate from ice rinks made by simply freezing water in a cold climate , indoors or outdoors , although both types are of frozen water .
A more proper technical term is ' mechanically frozen ' ice .
A famous example of this type of rink is the outdoor rink at Rockefeller Center in New York .
CONSTRUCTION Section::::Construction .
Modern rinks have a specific procedure for preparing the surface .
With the pipes cold , a thin layer of water is sprayed on the sand or concrete to seal and level it ( or in the case of concrete , to keep it from being marked ) .
This thin layer is painted white or pale blue for better contrast ; markings necessary for hockey or curling are also placed , along with logos or other decorations .
Another thin layer of water is sprayed on top of this .
The ice is built up to a thickness of 3/4ths an inch to 1 1/2 inches .
The industry standard in the NHL is around 1 1/2 " .
SYNTHETIC Section::::Synthetic .
Synthetic rinks are constructed from a solid polymer material designed for skating using normal metal - bladed ice skates .
High density polyethelene ( HDPE ) and ultra - high molecular weight polyethylene ( UHMW ) are the only materials that offer reasonable skating characteristics , with UHMW synthetic rinks offering the most ice - like skating but also being the most expensive .
A typical synthetic rink will consist of many panels of thin surface material assembled on top of a sturdy , level and smooth sub - floor ( anything from concrete to wood or even dirt or grass ) to create a large skating area .
OPERATION Section::::Operation .
Periodically after the ice has been used , it is resurfaced using a machine called an ice resurfacer ( sometimes colloquially referred to as a Zamboni – referring to a major manufacturer of such machinery ) .
For curling , the surface is ' pebbled ' by allowing loose drops of cold water to fall onto the ice and freeze into rounded peaks .
Between events , especially if the arena is being used without need for the ice surface , it is either covered with a heavily insulated floor or melted by allowing the fluid in the pipes below the ice to warm .
A highly specialized form of rink is used for speed skating ; this is a large oval ( or ring ) much like an athletic track .
Because of their limited use , speed skating ovals are far less common than hockey or curling rinks .
Those skilled at preparing arena ice are often in demand for major events where ice quality is critical .
The popularity of the sport of hockey in Canada has led its icemakers to be particularly sought after .
One such team of professionals was responsible for placing a loonie coin under center ice at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City , Utah ; as both Canadian teams ( men 's and women 's ) won their respective hockey gold medals , the coin was christened " lucky " and is now in the possession of the Hockey Hall of Fame after having been retrieved from beneath the ice .
STANDARD RINK SIZES BANDY
Section::::Standard rink sizes .
Section::::Bandy .
In bandy , the rink size is x .
For internationals , the size must not be smaller than x .
The variety rink bandy is played on ice hockey rinks .
FIGURE SKATING
Section::::Figure skating .
The size of figure skating rinks can be quite variable , but the International Skating Union prefers Olympic - sized rinks for figure skating competitions , particularly for major events .
These are 60 meters by 30 meters .
The ISU specifies that competition rinks must not be larger than this and not smaller than 56 meters by 26 meters .
ICE HOCKEY Section::::Ice hockey .
There are basically two rink sizes in use , although there is a great deal of variation in the dimensions of actual ice rinks .
Historically , earlier ice rinks were smaller than today .
Official National Hockey League rinks are .
The dimensions originate from the size of the Victoria Skating Rink in Montreal , Quebec , Canada .
Official Olympic
/ International rinks have dimensions of .
SPEED SKATING
Section::::Speed skating .
In speed skating , for short track , the official Olympic rink size is 30 x 60 meters , with an oval ice track of 111.12 meters in circumference .
In long track speed skating the oval ice track is usually 400 meters in circumference .
