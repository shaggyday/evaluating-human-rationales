STAR WARS ( FILM )
Star Wars
( later retitled Star Wars :
Episode IV – A New Hope ) is a 1977 American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas .
It is the first film in the original Star Wars trilogy and the beginning of the Star Wars franchise .
Starring Mark Hamill , Harrison Ford , Carrie Fisher , Peter Cushing , Alec Guinness , David Prowse , James Earl Jones , Anthony Daniels , Kenny Baker , and Peter Mayhew , the film focuses on the Rebel Alliance , led by Princess Leia ( Fisher ) , and its attempt to destroy the Galactic Empire 's space station , the Death Star .
Star Wars was released in theatres in the United States on May 25 , 1977 .
It earned $ 461 million in the U.S. and $ 314 million overseas , totaling $ 775 million .
It surpassed Jaws ( 1975 ) to become the highest - grossing film of all time until the release of E.T. the Extra - Terrestrial ( 1982 ) .
When adjusted for inflation , Star Wars is the second - highest - grossing film in North America , and the third - highest - grossing film in the world .
It received ten Academy Award nominations ( including Best Picture ) , winning seven .
It was among the first films to be selected as part of the U.S. Library of Congress 's National Film Registry as being " culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant " .
At the time , it was the most recent film on the registry and the only one chosen from the 1970s .
In 2005 , the British Film Institute included it in their list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14 .
Its soundtrack was added to the U.S. National Recording Registry in 2004 .
Today , it is regarded as one of the most important films in the history of motion pictures .
It launched an industry of tie - in products , including spin - off TV series , novels , comic books , video games , amusement park attractions , and merchandise including toys , games , and clothing .
The film has been reissued multiple times at Lucas 's behest , incorporating many changes including modified computer - generated effects , altered dialogue , re - edited shots , remixed soundtracks and added scenes .
The film 's success led to two critically and commercially successful sequels , The Empire Strikes Back in 1980 and Return of the Jedi in 1983 , and later to a prequel trilogy , a sequel trilogy , and two anthology films .

PRODUCTION
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Production .
Section::::Development .
Lucas has said that it was early as 1971—after he completed directing his first full - length feature , THX 1138—that
he first had an idea for a space fantasy film , though he has also claimed to have had the idea long before then .
Lucas believed that the bleak tone of THX 1138 led to its poor reception , and therefore chose to make Star Wars more optimistic .
This is what led to the fun and adventurous tone of the space opera .
Originally , Lucas wanted to adapt the Flash Gordon space adventure comics and serials into his own films , having been fascinated by them since he was young .
In 1979 , he said , " I especially loved the Flash Gordon serials ...
Of course I realize now how crude and badly done they were ... loving them that much when they were so awful , I began to wonder what would happen if they were done really well . "
At the Cannes Film Festival following the completion of THX 1138 , Lucas was granted a two - film development deal with United Artists ; the two films were American Graffiti , and an untitled space opera inspired by Flash Gordon .
He pushed towards buying the Flash Gordon rights , later recounting :
Director Francis Ford Coppola , who accompanied Lucas in trying to buy the Flash Gordon rights , recounted in 1999 :
" [ George ] was very depressed because he had just come back and they would n't sell him Flash Gordon .
And he says , ' Well , I 'll just invent my own .
Lucas went to United Artists and showed them the script for American Graffiti , but they passed on the film , which was then picked up by Universal Pictures .
United Artists also passed on Lucas ' space opera concept , which he shelved for the time being .
After spending the next two years completing American Graffiti , Lucas turned his attention to his space opera .
He drew inspiration from politics of the era , later saying , " It was really about the Vietnam War , and that was the period where Nixon was trying to run for a [ second ] term , which got me to thinking historically about how do democracies get turned into dictatorships ? "
Lucas began writing in January 1973 , " eight hours a day , five days a week " , by taking small notes , inventing odd names and assigning them possible characterizations .
Lucas would discard many of these by the time the final script was written , but he included several names and places in the final script or its sequels .
He used these initial names and ideas to compile a two - page synopsis titled Journal of the Whills , which told the tale of the training of apprentice CJ Thorpe as a " Jedi - Bendu " space commando by the legendary Mace Windy .
Frustrated that his story was too difficult to understand , Lucas then began writing a 13-page treatment called The Star Wars on April 17 , 1973 , which had thematic parallels with Akira Kurosawa 's 1958 film The Hidden Fortress .
After United Artists declined to budget the film , Lucas and producer Gary Kurtz presented the film treatment to Universal Pictures , the studio that financed American Graffiti ; however , it rejected its options for the film because the concept was " a little strange " , and it said that Lucas should follow American Graffiti with more consequential themes .
Disney also turned down the film .
Lucas said , " I 've always been an outsider to Hollywood types .
They think I do weirdo films . "
According to Kurtz , Lew Wasserman , the studio 's head , " just did n't think much of science fiction at that time , did n't think it had much of a future then , with that particular audience . "
He said that " science fiction was n't popular in the mid-'70s ...
what seems to be the case generally is that the studio executives are looking for what was popular last year , rather than trying to look forward to what might be popular next year . "
Lucas explained in 1977 that the film is not " about the future " and that it " is a fantasy much closer to the Brothers Grimm than it is to " .
He added : " My main reason for making it was to give young people an honest , wholesome fantasy life , the kind my generation had .
We had Westerns , pirate movies , all kinds of great things .
Now they have The Six Million Dollar Man and Kojak .
Where are the romance , the adventure , and the fun that used to be in practically every movie made ? "
Kurtz said , " Although Star Wars was n't like [ then - current science fiction ] at all , it was just sort of lumped into that same kind of category . "
There were also concerns regarding the project 's potentially high budget .
Lucas and Kurtz , in pitching the film , said that it would be " low - budget , Roger Corman style , and the budget was never going to be more than —
well , originally we had proposed about 8 million , it ended up being about 10 .
Both of those figures are very low budget by Hollywood standards at the time . "
After Walt Disney Productions rejected the project , Lucas and Kurtz persisted in securing a studio to support the film because " other people had read it and said , ' Yeah , it could be a good idea ...
Lucas pursued Alan Ladd Jr. , the head of 20th Century Fox , and in June 1973 completed a deal to write and direct the film .
Although Ladd did not grasp the technical side of the project , he believed that Lucas was talented .
Lucas later stated that Ladd " invested in me , he did not invest in the movie .
"
The deal gave Lucas $ 150,000 to write and direct the film .
WRITING Section::::Writing .
Since commencing his writing process in January 1973 , Lucas had done " various rewrites in the evenings after the day 's work . "
He would write four different screenplays for Star Wars , " searching for just the right ingredients , characters and storyline .
It 's always been what you might call a good idea in search of a story .
" By May 1974 , he had expanded the film treatment into a rough draft screenplay , adding elements such as the Sith , the Death Star , and a general by the name of Annikin Starkiller .
He changed Starkiller to an adolescent boy , and he shifted the general into a supporting role as a member of a family of dwarfs .
Lucas envisioned the Corellian smuggler , Han Solo , as a large , green - skinned monster with gills .
He based Chewbacca on his Alaskan Malamute dog , Indiana ( whom he would later use as namesake for his character Indiana Jones ) , who often acted as the director 's " co - pilot " by sitting in the passenger seat of his car .
Lucas began researching the science fiction genre by watching films and reading books and comics .
His first script incorporated ideas from many new sources , including Joseph Campbell 's The Hero with a Thousand Faces .
The script would also introduce the concept of a Jedi Master and his son , who trains to be a Jedi under his father 's friend ; this would ultimately form the basis for the film and , later , the trilogy .
However , in this draft , the father is a hero who is still alive at the start of the film .
Lucas completed a second draft of The Star Wars in January 1975 , making heavy simplifications and introducing the young hero on a farm as Luke Starkiller .
Annikin became Luke 's father , a wise Jedi knight .
"
The Force " was also introduced as a mystical energy field .
This second draft still had some differences from the final version in the characters and relationships .
For example , Luke had several brothers , as well as his father , who appears in a minor role at the end of the film .
The script became more of a fairy tale quest as opposed to the action - adventure of the previous versions .
This version ended with another text crawl , previewing the next story in the series .
This draft was also the first to introduce the concept of a Jedi turning to the dark side : the draft included a historical Jedi who became the first to ever fall to the dark side , and then trained the Sith to use it .
Impressed with his works , Lucas hired conceptual artist Ralph McQuarrie to create paintings of certain scenes around this time .
When Lucas delivered his screenplay to the studio , he included several of McQuarrie 's paintings .
A third draft , dated August 1 , 1975 , was titled The Star Wars : From the Adventures of Luke Starkiller .
This third draft had most of the elements of the final plot , with only some differences in the characters and settings .
The draft characterized Luke as an only child , with his father already dead , replacing him with a substitute named Ben Kenobi .
This script would be re - written for the fourth and final draft , dated January 1 , 1976 , as The Adventures of Luke Starkiller as taken from the Journal of the Whills , Saga
I : The Star Wars .
Lucas worked with his friends Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck to revise the fourth draft into the final pre - production script .
20th Century Fox approved a budget of $ 8.25 million ; American Graffitis positive reception afforded Lucas the leverage necessary to renegotiate his deal with Alan Ladd Jr. and request the sequel rights to the film .
For Lucas , this deal protected Star Warss unwritten segments and most of the merchandising profits .
Lucas finished writing his script in March 1976 , when the crew started filming .
He said , " What finally emerged through the many drafts of the script has obviously been influenced by science - fiction and action - adventure I 've read and seen .
And I 've seen a lot of it .
I 'm trying to make a classic sort of genre picture , a classic space fantasy in which all the influences are working together .
There are certain traditional aspects of the genre I wanted to keep and help perpetuate in Star Wars . "
During production , he changed Luke 's name from Starkiller to Skywalker and altered the title to The Star Wars and later Star Wars .
He would also continue to tweak the script during filming , including adding the death of Obi - Wan after realizing he served no purpose in the ending of the film .
For the film 's opening crawl , Lucas originally wrote a composition consisting of six paragraphs with four sentences each .
He said , " The crawl is such a hard thing because you have to be careful that you 're not using too many words that people do n't understand .
It 's like a poem . "
Lucas showed his draft to his friends .
Director Brian De Palma , who was there , described it : " The crawl at the beginning looks like it was written on a driveway .
It goes on forever .
It 's gibberish . "
Lucas recounted what De Palma said the first time he saw it : " George , you 're out of your mind !
Let me sit down and write this for you . "
De Palma helped edit the text into the form used in the film .
DESIGN Section::::Design .
George Lucas recruited many conceptual designers , including Colin Cantwell , who worked on ( 1968 ) , to conceptualize the initial spacecraft models ; Alex Tavoularis to create the preliminary conceptual storyboard sketches of early scripts ; and Ralph McQuarrie to visualize the characters , costumes , props and scenery .
McQuarrie 's pre - production paintings of certain scenes from Lucas 's early screenplay drafts helped 20th Century Fox visualize the film , which positively influenced their decision to fund the project .
After McQuarrie 's drawings for Lucas 's colleagues Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins ( who were collaborating for a film ) caught his interest , Lucas met with McQuarrie to discuss his plans for the untitled space fantasy film he wanted to make .
Two years later , after completing American Graffiti , Lucas approached McQuarrie and asked him if he would be interested " in doing something for Star Wars . "
McQuarrie produced a series of artworks from simple sketches ; these set a visual tone for the film , and for the rest of the original trilogy .
The film was ambitious as Lucas wanted to create fresh prop prototypes and sets ( based on McQuarrie 's paintings ) that had never been realized before in science fiction films .
He commissioned production designers John Barry and Roger Christian , who were working on the sets of the film Lucky Lady ( 1975 ) when Lucas first approached them , to work on the production sets .
Christian recounted in 2014 : " George came to the set I was doing , it was an old salt factory design and he helped me shovel salt , just like two students in plaid shirts and sneakers .
And we spoke and he looked at the set and could n't believe it was n't real .
" They had a conversation with Lucas on what he would like the film to appear like , with them creating the desired sets .
Christian said that Lucas " did n't want anything [ in Star Wars ] to stand out , he wanted it [ to look ] all real and used .
And I said , ' Finally somebody 's doing it the right way . ' "
Lucas described a " used future " concept to the production designers in which all devices , ships , and buildings looked aged and dirty .
Instead of following the traditional sleekness and futuristic architecture of science fiction films that came before , the Star Wars sets were designed to look inhabited and used .
Barry said that the director " wants to make it look like it 's shot on location on your average everyday Death Star or Mos Eisley Spaceport or local cantina . "
Lucas believed that " what is required for true credibility is a used future " , opposing the interpretation of " future in most futurist movies " that " always looks new and clean and shiny . "
Christian supported Lucas 's vision , saying " All science fiction before was very plastic and stupid uniforms and Flash Gordon stuff .
Nothing was new .
George was going right against that . "
The designers started working with the director before Star Wars was approved by 20th Century Fox .
For four to five months , in a studio in Kensal Rise , England , they attempted to plan the creation of the props and sets with " no money " .
Although Lucas initially provided funds using his earnings from American Graffiti , it was inadequate .
As they could not afford to dress the sets , Christian was forced to use unconventional methods and materials to achieve the desired look .
He suggested that Lucas use scrap in making the dressings , and the director agreed .
Christian said , " I 've always had this idea .
I used to do it with models when I was a kid .
I 'd stick things on them and we 'd make things look old . "
Barry , Christian , and their team began designing the props and sets at Elstree Studios .
According to Christian , the Millennium Falcon set was the most difficult to build .
Christian wanted the interior of the Falcon to look like that of a submarine .
He found scrap airplane metal " that no one wanted in those days and bought them " .
He began his creation process by breaking down jet engines into scrap pieces , giving him the chance to " stick it in the sets in specific ways " .
It took him several weeks to finish the chess set ( which he described as " the most encrusted set " ) in the hold of the Falcon .
The garbage compactor set " was also pretty hard , because I knew I had actors in there and the walls had to come in , and they had to be in dirty water
and I had to get stuff that would be light enough
so it would n't hurt them but also not bobbing around " .
A total of 30 sets consisting of planets , starships , caves , control rooms , cantinas , and the Death Star corridors were created ; all of the nine sound stages at Elstree were used to accommodate them .
The massive rebel hangar set was housed at a second sound stage at Shepperton Studios ; the stage was the largest in Europe at the time .
FILMING Section::::Filming .
In 1975 , Lucas formed his own visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic ( ILM ) after discovering that 20th Century Fox 's visual effects department had been disbanded .
ILM began its work on Star Wars in a warehouse in Van Nuys , California .
Most of the visual effects used pioneering digital motion control photography developed by John Dykstra and his team , which created the illusion of size by employing small models and slowly moving cameras .
George Lucas tried " to get a cohesive reality " for his feature .
However , since the film is a fairy tale , as he had described , " I still wanted it to have an ethereal quality , yet be well composed and , also , have an alien look . "
He designed the film to have an " extremely bizarre , Gregg Toland - like surreal look with strange over - exposed colors , a lot of shadows , a lot of hot areas . "
Lucas wanted Star Wars to embrace the combination of " strange graphics of fantasy " and " the feel of a documentary " to impress a distinct look .
To achieve this , he hired the British cinematographer Gilbert Taylor .
Originally , Lucas 's first choice for the position was Geoffrey Unsworth , who also provided the cinematography for Stanley Kubrick 's 2001 : A Space Odyssey .
Unsworth was interested in working with the director , and initially accepted the job when it was offered to him by Lucas and Kurtz .
However , he eventually withdrew to work on the Vincente Minnelli - directed A Matter of Time ( 1976 ) instead , which " really annoy[ed ] " Kurtz .
Lucas called up for other cinematographers , and eventually chose Taylor , basing his choice on Taylor 's cinematography for Dr. Strangelove and A Hard Day 's Night ( both 1964 ) .
On his decision , Lucas said : " I thought they were good , eccentrically photographed pictures with a strong documentary flavor " .
Taylor said that Lucas , who was consumed by the details of the complicated production , " avoided all meetings and contact with me from day one , so I read the extra - long script many times and made my own decisions as to how I would shoot the picture . "
He also " took it upon myself to experiment with photographing the lightsabers and other things onstage before we moved on to our two weeks of location work in Tunisia " .
Taylor was aware of the " enormous amount of process work " to follow principal photography and believed " a crisp result would help " .
During production , Lucas and Taylor — whom Kurtz called " old - school " and " crotchety"—had disputes over filming .
With a background in independent filmmaking , Lucas was accustomed to creating most of the elements of the film himself .
His lighting suggestions were rejected by Taylor , who believed that Lucas was overstepping his boundaries by giving specific instructions , sometimes even moving lights and cameras himself .
Taylor refused to use the soft - focus lenses and gauze Lucas wanted after Fox executives complained about the look .
Kurtz stated that " In a couple of scenes [ ... ] rather than saying , ' It looks a bit over lit , can you fix that ? ' , [ Lucas would ] say , ' turn off this light , and turn off that light . '
And Gil would say , ' No , I wo n't do that
, I 've lit it the way I think it should be — tell me what 's the effect that you want , and I 'll make a judgment about what to do with my lights .
Originally , Lucas envisioned the planet of Tatooine , where much of the film would take place , as a jungle planet .
Gary Kurtz traveled to the Philippines to scout locations ; however , because of the idea of spending months filming in the jungle would make Lucas " itchy " , the director refined his vision and made Tatooine a desert planet instead .
Kurtz then researched all American , North African , and Middle Eastern deserts , and found Tunisia , near the Sahara desert , as the ideal location .
In the director 's commentary of the 2004 DVD edition of A New Hope , Lucas said he wanted to also make it look more " spacy " or outer space - like in style .
When principal photography began on March 22 , 1976 , in the Tunisian desert for the scenes on Tatooine , the project faced several problems .
Lucas fell behind schedule in the first week of shooting due to malfunctioning props and electronic breakdowns .
Moreover , a rare Tunisian rainstorm struck the country , which further disrupted filming .
Taylor said , " you could n't really see where the land ended and the sky began .
It was all a gray mess , and the robots were just a blur .
" Given this situation , Lucas requested for heavy filtration , which Taylor rejected , who said : " I thought the look of the film should be absolutely clean ...
But George saw it differently , so we tried using nets and other diffusion .
He asked to set up one shot on the robots with a 300 mm , and the sand and sky just mushed together .
I told him it would n't work , but he said that was the way he wanted to do the entire film , all diffused .
" This difference was later settled by 20th Century Fox executives , who backed Taylor 's suggestion .
Filming began in Chott el Djerid , while a construction crew in Tozeur took eight weeks to transform the desert into the desired setting .
Other locations included the sand dunes of the Tunisian desert near Nafta , where a scene featuring a giant skeleton of a creature lying in the background as R2-D2 and C-3PO make their way across the sands was filmed .
When actor Anthony Daniels wore the C-3PO outfit for the first time in Tunisia , the left leg piece shattered down through the plastic covering his left foot , stabbing him .
He also could not see through his costume 's eyes , which was covered with gold to prevent corrosion .
Abnormal radio signals caused by the Tunisian sands made the radio - controlled R2-D2 models run out of control .
Kenny Baker , who portrayed R2-D2 , said : " I was incredibly grateful each time an [ R2 ] would actually work right . "
After several scenes were filmed against the volcanic canyons outside Tozeur , production moved to Matmata to film Luke 's home on Tatooine .
Lucas chose Hotel Sidi Driss , which is larger than the typical underground dwellings , to shoot the interior of Luke 's homestead .
Additional scenes for Tatooine were filmed at Death Valley in North America .
After completing two and a half weeks of filming in Tunisia , the cast and crew moved into the more controlled environment of Elstree Studios , near London .
Difficulties encountered in Tunisia were assumed to cease ; however , due to strict British working conditions adhered to on set , a new problem arose : filming had to finish by 5:30 pm , unless Lucas was in the middle of a scene .
The interiors were shot in London due to its proximity to North Africa and because of the availability of top technical crews at Elstree Studios .
The film studio was the only one of its kind in Britain or America that could cater nine large stages at the same time and allow the company complete freedom to use its own personnel .
Despite Lucas 's efforts , his crew had little interest in the film .
Most of the crew considered the project a " children 's film " , rarely took their work seriously , and often found it unintentionally humorous .
Actor Baker later confessed that he thought the film would be a failure .
Harrison Ford found it strange that " there 's a princess with weird buns in her hair " , and he called Chewbacca a " giant in a monkey suit " .
The Elstree sets designed by John Barry , according to Gilbert Taylor , " were like a coal mine " .
He said that " they were all black and gray , with really no opportunities for lighting at all " .
To resolve the problem , he worked the lighting into the sets by chopping in its walls , ceiling and floors .
This would result in " a ' cut - out ' system of panel lighting " , with quartz lamps that could be placed in the holes in the walls , ceiling and floors .
His idea was supported by the Fox studio , which agreed that " we could n't have this ' black hole of Calcutta .
The lighting approach Taylor devised " allowed George to shoot in almost any direction without extensive relighting , which gave him more freedom .
"
In total , filming the scenes in Britain took 14 and a half weeks .
The moon Yavin 4 , which acted as the rebel base in the film , was filmed in the Mayan temples at Tikal , Guatemala .
Lucas selected the location as a potential filming site after seeing a poster of it hanging at a travel agency while he was filming in Britain .
This inspired him to send a film crew to Guatemala in March 1977 to shoot scenes .
While filming in Tikal , the crew paid locals with a six pack of beer to watch over the camera equipment for several days .
Lucas rarely spoke to the actors , who believed that he expected too much of them while providing little direction .
His directions to the actors usually consisted of the words " faster " and " more intense " .
Kurtz stated that " it happened a lot where he would just say , ' Let 's try it again a little bit faster . '
That was about the only instruction he 'd give anybody .
A lot of actors do n't mind — they do n't care , they just get on with it .
But some actors really need a lot of pampering and a lot of feedback , and if they do n't get it , they get paranoid that they might not be doing a good job .
" Kurtz has said that Lucas " was n't gregarious , he 's very much a loner and very shy , so he did n't like large groups of people , he did n't like working with a large crew , he did n't like working with a lot of actors . "
Ladd offered Lucas some of the only support from the studio ; he dealt with scrutiny from board members over the rising budget and complex screenplay drafts .
Initially , Fox approved $ 8 million for the project ; Gary Kurtz said : " we proceeded to pick a production plan and do a more final budget with a British art department and look for locations in North Africa , and kind of pulled together some things .
Then , it was obvious that 8 million was n't going to do it — they had approved 8 million . "
After requests from the team that " it had to be more " , the executives " got a bit scared " .
For two weeks , Lucas and his crew " did n't really do anything except kind of pull together new budget figures " .
At the same time , after production fell behind schedule , Ladd told Lucas he had to finish production within a week or he would be forced to shut down production .
Kurtz said that " it came out to be like 9.8 or .9 or something like that , and in the end they just said , ' Yes , that 's okay
, we 'll go ahead .
The crew split into three units , with those units led by Lucas , Kurtz , and production supervisor Robert Watts .
Under the new system , the project met the studio 's deadline .
During production , the cast attempted to make Lucas laugh or smile , as he often appeared depressed .
At one point , the project became so demanding that Lucas was diagnosed with hypertension and exhaustion and was warned to reduce his stress level .
Post - production was equally stressful due to increasing pressure from 20th Century Fox .
Moreover , Mark Hamill 's car accident left his face visibly scarred , which restricted re - shoots .
POST - PRODUCTION Section::::Post - production .
Star Wars was originally slated for release on Christmas 1976 ; however , its production delays pushed the film 's release to summer 1977 .
Already anxious about meeting his deadline , Lucas was shocked when editor John Jympson 's first cut of the film was a " complete disaster " .
According to an article in Star Wars Insider No . 41 by David West Reynolds , this first edit of Star Wars contained about 30–40 % different footage from the final version .
After attempting to persuade Jympson to cut the film his way , Lucas replaced him with Paul Hirsch and Richard Chew .
He also allowed his then - wife , Marcia Lucas , to aid the editing process while she was cutting the film New York , New York ( 1977 ) with Lucas 's friend Martin Scorsese .
Richard Chew found the film to have a lethargic pace and to have been cut in a by - the - book manner : scenes were played out in master shots that flowed into close - up coverage .
He found that the pace was dictated by the actors instead of the cuts .
Hirsch and Chew worked on two reels simultaneously .
Jympson 's original assembly contained a large amount of footage which differed from the final cut of the film , including several alternate takes and a number of scenes which were subsequently deleted to improve the narrative pace .
The most significant material cut was a series of scenes from the first part of the film which served to introduce the character of Luke Skywalker .
These early scenes , set in Anchorhead on the planet Tatooine , presented the audience with Luke 's everyday life among his friends as it is affected by the space battle above the planet ; they also introduced the character of Biggs Darklighter , Luke 's closest friend who departs to join the rebellion .
Chew explained the rationale behind removing these scenes as a narrative decision : " In the first five minutes , we were hitting everybody with more information than they could handle .
There were too many story lines to keep straight : the robots and the Princess , Vader , Luke .
So we simplified it by taking out Luke and Biggs " .
After viewing a rough cut , Alan Ladd likened these Anchorhead scenes to " American Graffiti in outer space " .
Lucas was looking for a way of accelerating the storytelling , and removing Luke 's early scenes would distinguish Star Wars from his earlier teenage drama and " get that American Graffiti feel out of it " .
Lucas also stated that he wanted to move the narrative focus to C-3PO and R2-D2 : " At the time , to have the first half - hour of the film be mainly about robots was a bold idea . "
Meanwhile , Industrial Light & Magic was struggling to achieve unprecedented special effects .
The company had spent half of its budget on four shots that Lucas deemed unacceptable .
Moreover , theories surfaced that the workers at ILM lacked discipline , forcing Lucas to intervene frequently to ensure that they were on schedule .
With hundreds of uncompleted shots remaining , ILM was forced to finish a year 's work in six months .
Lucas inspired ILM by editing together aerial dogfights from old war films , which enhanced the pacing of the scenes .
During the chaos of production and post - production , the team made decisions about character voicing and sound effects .
Sound designer Ben Burtt had created a library of sounds that Lucas referred to as an " organic soundtrack " .
Blaster sounds were a modified recording of a steel cable , under tension , being struck .
The lightsaber sound effect was developed by Burtt as a combination of the hum of idling interlock motors in aged movie projectors and interference caused by a television set on a shieldless microphone .
Burtt discovered the latter accidentally as he was looking for a buzzing , sparking sound to add to the projector - motor hum .
For Chewbacca 's growls , Burtt recorded and combined sounds made by dogs , bears , lions , tigers , and walruses to create phrases and sentences .
Lucas and Burtt created the robotic voice of R2-D2 by filtering their voices through an electronic synthesizer .
Darth Vader 's breathing was achieved by Burtt breathing through the mask of a scuba regulator implanted with a microphone .
In February 1977 , Lucas screened an early cut of the film for Fox executives , several director friends , along with Roy Thomas and Howard Chaykin of Marvel Comics who were preparing a Star Wars comic book .
The cut had a different crawl from the finished version and used Prowse 's voice for Darth Vader .
It also lacked most special effects ; hand - drawn arrows took the place of blaster beams , and when the Millennium Falcon fought TIE fighters , the film cut to footage of World War II dogfights .
The reactions of the directors present , such as Brian De Palma , John Milius , and Steven Spielberg , disappointed Lucas .
Spielberg , who claimed to have been the only person in the audience to have enjoyed the film , believed that the lack of enthusiasm was due to the absence of finished special effects .
Lucas later said that the group was honest and seemed bemused by the film .
In contrast , Ladd and the other studio executives loved the film ; Gareth Wigan told Lucas : " This is the greatest film I 've ever seen " and cried during the screening .
Lucas found the experience shocking and rewarding , having never gained any approval from studio executives before .
The delays increased the budget from $ 8 million to $ 11 million .
With the project $ 2 million over budget , Lucas was forced to make numerous artistic compromises to complete Star Wars .
Ladd reluctantly agreed to release an extra $ 20,000 funding and in early 1977 second unit filming completed a number of sequences including exterior desert shots for Tatooine in Death Valley and China Lake Acres in California , and exterior Yavin jungle shots in Guatemala , along with additional studio footage to complete the Mos Eisley Cantina sequence .
Lucas had planned to rework a confrontation scene between Han Solo and Jabba the Hutt in Mos Eisley Spaceport by compositing a stop - motion animated model of Jabba to replace the actor Declan Mulholland , but with time and money running out , Lucas reluctantly decided to cut the scene entirely .
The sequence was later re - instated in the 1997 Special Edition with a computer - generated version of Jabba .
SOUNDTRACK Section::::Soundtrack .
On the recommendation of his friend Steven Spielberg , Lucas hired composer John Williams .
Williams had worked with Spielberg on the film Jaws , for which he won an Academy Award .
Lucas believed that the film would portray visually foreign worlds , but that the musical score would give the audience an emotional familiarity ; he wanted a grand musical sound for Star Wars , with leitmotifs to provide distinction .
Therefore , he assembled his favorite orchestral pieces for the soundtrack , until Williams convinced him that an original score would be unique and more unified .
However , a few of Williams 's pieces were influenced by the tracks given to him by Lucas : the " Main Title Theme " was inspired by the theme from the 1942 film Kings Row , scored by Erich Wolfgang Korngold ; and
the track " Dune Sea of Tatooine " drew from the soundtrack of Bicycle Thieves , scored by Alessandro Cicognini .
In March 1977 , Williams conducted the London Symphony Orchestra to record the Star Wars soundtrack in 12 days .
The original soundtrack was released as a double LP in 1977 by 20th Century Records .
20th Century Records also released The Story of Star Wars that same year , a narrated audio drama adaptation of the film utilizing some of its original music , dialogue , and sound effects .
The American Film Institute 's list of best film scores ranks the Star Wars soundtrack at number one .
CINEMATIC AND LITERARY ALLUSIONS Section::::Cinematic and literary allusions .
According to Lucas , different concepts of the film were inspired by numerous sources , such as Beowulf and King Arthur for the origins of myth and religion .
Lucas had originally intended to remake the 1930s Flash Gordon film serials , but was unable to obtain the rights ; thus , he resorted to drawing from Akira Kurosawa 's 1958 film The Hidden Fortress , and Joseph Campbell 's The Hero with a Thousand Faces .
Star Wars features many elements derived from Flash Gordon , such as the conflict between rebels and Imperial Forces , the wipes between scenes , the fusion of futuristic technology and traditional mythology , and the famous opening crawl that begins each film .
The film has also been compared to The Wizard of Oz .
The influence of The Hidden Fortress can be seen in the relationship between C-3PO and R2-D2 , which evolved from the two bickering peasants , Tahei and Matashichi , and a Japanese family crest seen in the earlier film is similar to the Imperial Crest .
Star Wars also borrows heavily from another Kurosawa film , Yojimbo ( 1961 ) .
In both films , several men threaten the hero , bragging about how wanted they are by the authorities , and have an arm being cut off by a blade ; Kuwabatake Sanjuro ( portrayed by Toshiro Mifune ) is offered " ...
twenty - five ryo now , twenty - five when you complete the mission ...
" , whereas Han Solo is offered " Two thousand now , plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan .
"
Its sequel Sanjuro ( 1962 ) also inspired the hiding - under - the - floor trick featured in the film .
Another source of influence was Lawrence of Arabia ( 1962 ) , which inspired the film 's visual approach , including long - lens desert shots .
There are also thematic parallels , including the freedom fight by a rebel army against an empire , and politicians who meddle behind the scenes .
Tatooine is similar to the desert planet of Arrakis from Frank Herbert 's Dune series .
Arrakis is the only known source of a longevity spice ; Star Wars makes references to spice in " the spice mines of Kessel " , and a spice freighter .
Other similarities include those between Princess Leia and Princess Alia , and Jedi mind tricks and " The Voice " , a controlling ability used by the Bene Gesserit .
In passing , Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru are " moisture farmers " ; in Dune , dew collectors are used by Fremen to " provide a small but reliable source of water . "
Frank Herbert reported that " David Lynch , [ director of the 1984 film Dune ] had trouble with the fact that Star Wars used up so much of Dune .
"
The pair found " sixteen points of identity " and they calculated that " the odds against coincidence produced a number larger than the number of stars in the universe . "
The Death Star assault scene was modeled after the World War II film
The Dam Busters ( 1955 ) , in which Royal Air Force Lancaster bombers fly along heavily defended reservoirs and aim bouncing bombs at dams , in order to cripple the heavy industry of Germany 's Ruhr region .
Some of the dialogue in The Dam Busters is repeated in the Star Wars climax ; Gilbert Taylor also filmed the special effects sequences in The Dam Busters .
In addition , the sequence was partially inspired by the climax of the film 633 Squadron ( 1964 ) , directed by Walter Grauman , in which RAF de Havilland Mosquitos attack a German heavy water plant by flying down a narrow fjord to drop special bombs at a precise point , while avoiding anti - aircraft guns and German fighters .
Clips from both films were included in Lucas 's temporary dogfight footage version of the sequence .
The opening shot of Star Wars , in which a detailed spaceship fills the screen overhead , is a reference to the scene introducing the interplanetary spacecraft
Discovery One in Stanley Kubrick 's seminal 1968 film .
The earlier big - budget science fiction film influenced the look of Star Wars in many other ways , including the use of EVA pods and hexagonal corridors .
The Death Star has a docking bay reminiscent of the one on the orbiting space station in 2001 .
Although golden and male , C-3PO was inspired by the silver female robot Maria , the Maschinenmensch from Fritz Lang 's 1927 film Metropolis .
TITLE Section::::Title .
The film was originally released in 1977 with the title " Star Wars " .
The subtitles Episode IV and A New Hope were only added to the opening crawl in subsequent re - releases .
Official sources state that the change was made at the theatrical re - release of April 10 , 1981 .
The retroactive addition of these subtitles was intended to bring the film into line with the introduction to its sequel , The Empire Strikes Back , which was released in 1980 bearing the designation " Episode V " .
Lucas has claimed to have had Episode IVs subtitle in mind before its release , but removed it to avoid confusing audiences .
Kurtz has corroborated that they had originally considered using a higher episode number to emulate the chapter numbering used in the Flash Gordon serial .
Some of Lucas 's early script drafts bear titles such as " The Adventures of the Starkiller ( Episode One ) : The Star Wars " ( 1975 ) or " The Adventures of Luke Starkiller as Taken from the Journal of the Whills : Saga One :
Star Wars " ( 1976 ) .
The revised fourth draft of the script dated January 1975 acquired the subtitle " Episode IV : A New Hope – from the Journal of the Whills " when published in the 1979 book
The Art of Star Wars .
MARKETING
Section::::Marketing .
While the film was in production , a logo was commissioned from Dan Perri , a title sequence designer who had worked on the titles for films such as The Exorcist ( 1973 ) , Taxi Driver ( 1976 ) .
Perri devised a foreshortened STAR WARS logotype consisting of block - capital letters filled with stars and skewed towards a vanishing point .
This logo design was originally conceived to follow the same perspective as the film 's opening crawl .
In the end , Perri 's logo was not used for the film 's opening title sequence , although it was used widely on pre - release print advertising and on cinema marquees .
The logotype eventually selected for on - screen use originated in a promotional brochure that was distributed by Fox to cinema owners in 1976 .
This brochure was designed by Suzy Rice , a young art director at the Los Angeles advertising agency Seiniger Advertising .
On a visit to ILM in Van Nuys , Rice was instructed by Lucas to produce a logo that would intimidate the viewer , and he reportedly asked for the logo to appear " very fascist " in style .
Rice 's response to her brief was to use an outlined , modified Helvetica Black .
After some feedback from Lucas , Rice decided to join the S and T of STAR and the R and S of WARS .
Lucas signed off on the brochure in between takes while filming inserts for the Mos Eisley Cantina scene .
Gary Kurtz was impressed with Rice 's logo and selected it over Perri 's design for the film 's opening titles , after modifying the letter W to flatten the pointed tips originally designed by Rice .
This finalised the design of one of the most recognisable logos in cinema design , although Rice 's contribution was not credited in the film .
For the US release in 1977 , 20th Century Fox commissioned a promotional film poster from the advertising agency Smolen , Smith and Connolly .
They used the freelance artist Tom Jung who was given the brief of " good over evil " .
His poster , known as , depicted Luke Skywalker standing in a heroic pose , brandishing a shining lightsaber above his head , with Princess Leia below him , and a large , ghostly image of Darth Vader 's helmet looming behind them .
Some Fox executives considered this poster " too dark " and commissioned the Brothers Hildebrandt , a pair of well - known fantasy artists , to rework the poster for the UK release .
When the film opened in British theaters , the Hildebrandts ' was used in cinema billboards .
Fox and Lucasfilm subsequently decided that they wanted to promote the new film with a less stylised and more realistic depiction of the lead characters .
Producer Gary Kurtz turned to the film poster artist Tom Chantrell , who was already well known for his prolific work for Hammer horror films , and commissioned a new version .
Two months after Star Wars opened , the Hildebrandts ' poster was replaced by Chantrell 's in UK cinemas .
RELEASE PREMIERE AND INITIAL
RELEASE
Section::::Release .
Section::::Premiere and initial release .
Lucasfilm hired Charles Lippincott as marketing director for Star Wars .
As 20th Century Fox gave little support for marketing beyond licensing T - shirts and posters , Lippincott was forced to look elsewhere .
He secured deals with Marvel Comics for a comic book adaptation , and with Del Rey Books for a novelization .
A fan of science fiction , he used his contacts to promote the film at the San Diego Comic - Con and elsewhere within science fiction fandom .
Worried that Star Wars would be beaten out by other summer films , such as Smokey and the Bandit , 20th Century Fox moved the release date to May 25 , the Wednesday before Memorial Day .
However , fewer than 40 theaters ordered the film to be shown .
In response , the studio demanded that theaters order Star Wars if they wanted the eagerly anticipated The Other Side of Midnight based on the novel by the same name .
Star Wars debuted on Wednesday , May 25 , 1977 , in fewer than 32 theaters , and eight more on Thursday and Friday .
Kurtz said in 2002 , " That would be laughable today .
" It immediately broke box office records , effectively becoming one of the first blockbuster films , and Fox accelerated plans to broaden its release .
Lucas himself was not able to predict how successful Star Wars would be .
After visiting the set of the Steven Spielberg film Close Encounters of the Third Kind , Lucas was sure Close Encounters would outperform the yet - to - be - released Star Wars at the box office .
Spielberg disagreed , and believed Star Wars would be the bigger hit .
Lucas proposed they trade 2.5 % of the profit on each other 's films ; Spielberg took the trade , and still receives 2.5 % of the profits from Star Wars .
Fox initially had doubts if Star Wars would emerge successful .
The Other Side of Midnight was supposed to be the studio 's big summer hit , while Lucas 's movie was considered the " B track " for theater owners nationwide .
While Fox requested Mann 's Chinese Theatre , the studio promised that the film only needed two weeks .
Fearing that the film would fail , Lucas had made plans to be in Hawaii with his wife Marcia .
Having forgotten that the film would open that day , he spent most of Wednesday in a sound studio in Los Angeles .
When Lucas went out for lunch with Marcia , they encountered a long line of people along the sidewalks leading to Mann 's Chinese Theatre , waiting to see Star Wars .
He was still skeptical of the film 's success , even with enthusiastic reports from Ladd and the studio .
While in Hawaii , it was not until he watched Walter Cronkite discuss the gigantic crowds for Star Wars on the CBS Evening News that Lucas realized he had become very wealthy ; Francis Ford Coppola , who needed money to finish Apocalypse Now , sent a telegram to Lucas 's hotel asking for funding .
Even technical crew members , such as model makers , were asked for autographs , and cast members became instant household names ; when Ford visited a record store to buy an album , enthusiastic fans tore half his shirt off .
The film was a huge success for 20th Century Fox , and was credited for reinvigorating the company .
Within three weeks of the film 's release , the studio 's stock price had doubled to a record high .
Prior to 1977 , 20th Century Fox 's greatest annual profits were $ 37 million , while in 1977 , the company broke that record by posting a profit of $ 79 million .
Although the film 's cultural neutrality helped it to gain international success , Ladd became anxious during the premiere in Japan .
After the screening , the audience was silent , leading him to fear that the film would be unsuccessful .
Ladd was reassured by his local contacts that this was a positive reaction considering that in Japan , silence was the greatest honor to a film , and the subsequent strong box office returns confirmed its popularity .
After two weeks William Friedkin 's Sorcerer replaced Star Wars at Mann 's Chinese Theatre because of contractual obligations ; Mann Theatres moved the film to a less - prestigious location after quickly renovating it .
When Star Wars made an unprecedented second opening at Mann 's Chinese Theatre on August 3 , 1977 , after Sorcerer failed , thousands of people attended a ceremony in which C-3PO , R2-D2 and Darth Vader placed their footprints in the theater 's forecourt .
At that time Star Wars was playing in 1,096 theaters in the United States .
Approximately 60 theaters played the film continuously for over a year ; in 1978 , Lucasfilm distributed " Birthday Cake " posters to those theaters for special events on May 25 , the one - year anniversary of the film 's release .
Star Wars premiered in the UK on December 27 , 1977 .
News reports of the film 's popularity in America caused long lines to form at the two London theaters that first offered the film ; it became available in 12 large cities in January 1978 , and other London theaters in February .
LATER RELEASES Section::::Later releases .
Star Wars was re - released theatrically in 1978 , 1979 , 1981 and 1982 .
After ILM used computer - generated effects for Steven Spielberg 's 1993 film Jurassic Park , Lucas claimed that digital technology had caught up to his " original vision " for Star Wars .
For the film 's 20th anniversary in 1997 , Star Wars was digitally remastered and re - released to movie theaters , along with The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi , under the campaign title Star Wars Trilogy : Special Edition .
This version of the film runs 124 minutes .
The Special Edition contains visual shots and scenes that were unachievable in the original release due to financial , technological , and time constraints ; one such scene involves a meeting between Han Solo and Jabba the Hutt .
The process of creating the new visual effects for Star Wars was featured in the documentary film , , directed by Star Wars sound designer , Ben Burtt .
Although most changes are minor or cosmetic in nature , many fans and critics believe that Lucas degraded the film with the additions .
A particularly controversial change in which a bounty hunter named Greedo shoots first when confronting Han Solo has inspired T - shirts brandishing the phrase " Han Shot First " .
Star Wars required extensive recovery of misplaced footage and restoration of the whole , before Lucas 's Special Edition modifications could be attempted .
It was discovered that in addition to the negative motion picture stocks commonly used on feature films , Lucas had also used Color Reversal Internegative ( CRI ) film , a reversal stock which deteriorated faster than negative stocks did , although theoretically it was higher quality as it saved two generations ( an interpositive followed by an internegative ) , where employed ( CRI was subsequently discontinued by Kodak ) .
This meant that the entire composited negative had to be disassembled , and the CRI portions cleaned separately from the negative portions .
Once the cleaning was complete , the film was scanned into the computer for restoration .
In many cases , entire scenes had to be reconstructed from their individual elements .
Digital compositing technology allowed them to correct for problems such as alignment of mattes , " blue - spill " , and so forth .
The 1977 theatrical version of Star Wars was selected by the National Film Registry of the United States Library of Congress in 1989 .
35 mm reels of the 1997 Special Edition were initially presented for preservation because of the difficulty of transferring from the original prints , but it was later revealed that the Library possessed a copyright deposit print of the original theatrical release .
By 2015 , it had been transferred to a 2 K scan which can be viewed by appointment .
HOME MEDIA Section::::Home media .
In the United States , France , West Germany , Italy and Japan , parts of or the whole film were released on Super 8 .

The film was released for the first time on DVD on September 21 , 2004 , in a box set with The Empire Strikes Back , Return of the Jedi , and a bonus disc of supplementary material .
The films were digitally restored and remastered , and more changes were made by George Lucas .
The DVD features a commentary track from Lucas , Ben Burtt , Dennis Muren , and Carrie Fisher .
The bonus disc contains the documentary Empire of Dreams :
The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy , three featurettes , teasers , theatrical trailers , TV spots , still galleries , an exclusive preview of , a playable Xbox demo of the LucasArts game , and a " Making Of " documentary on .

The trilogy was re - released on separate two - disc limited edition DVD sets from September 12 to December 31 , 2006 , and again in a limited edition tin box set on November 4 , 2008 ; the original versions of the films were added as bonus material .
The release was met with criticism as the unaltered versions were from the 1993 non - anamorphic LaserDisc masters and were not re - transferred using modern video standards .
The transfer led to problems with colors and digital image jarring .
All six Star Wars films were released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on Blu - ray Disc on September 16 , 2011 in three different editions , with A New Hope available in both a box set of the original trilogy and with all six films on Star Wars :
The Complete Saga , which includes nine discs and over 40 hours of special features .
The original theatrical versions of the films were not included in the box set ; however , the new 2011 revisions of the trilogy were leaked a month prior to release , inciting controversy the new changes made to these movies and causing an online uproar against Lucas .
On April 7 , 2015 , Walt Disney Studios , 20th Century Fox , and Lucasfilm jointly announced the digital releases of the six released Star Wars films .
Fox released A New Hope for digital download on April 10 , 2015 and Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the other five films .
In December 2016 , an interview done by Rogue One director Gareth Edwards revealed that Lucasfilm had recently completed a 4 K restoration of the film , but did not elaborate on whether the restored version was based on the 1977 original or a subsequent re - release .

The film was met with critical acclaim upon its release .
In his 1977 review , Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun - Times called the film " an out - of - body experience " , compared its special effects to those of , and opined that the true strength of the film was its " pure narrative " .
Vincent Canby of The New York Times called the film " the movie that 's going to entertain a lot of contemporary folk who have a soft spot for the virtually ritualized manners of comic - book adventure " and " the most elaborate , most expensive , most beautiful movie serial ever made . "
A.D. Murphy of Variety described the film as " magnificent " and claimed George Lucas had succeeded in his attempt to create the " biggest possible adventure fantasy " based on the serials and older action epics from his childhood .
Writing for The Washington Post , Gary Arnold gave the film a positive review , writing that the film " is a new classic in a rousing movie tradition : a space swashbuckler . "
However , the film was not without its detractors :
Pauline Kael of The New Yorker criticized Star Wars , stating that " there 's no breather in the picture , no lyricism " , and that it had no " emotional grip " .
John Simon of New York magazine also panned the film and wrote , " Strip Star Wars of its often striking images and its highfalutin scientific jargon , and you get a story , characters , and dialogue of overwhelming banality . "
Stanley Kauffmann , reviewing the film in The New Republic , opined that it " was made for those ( particularly males ) who carry a portable shrine within them of their adolescence , a chalice of a Self that was Better Then , before the world 's affairs or — in any complex way — sex intruded . "
When Star Wars opened in the UK , stating that Lucas 's earlier films were better , Derek Malcolm of The Guardian concluded that it " plays enough games to satisfy the most sophisticated . "
The Daily Telegraphs science correspondent Adrian Berry said that Star Wars " is the best such film since 2001 and in certain respects it is one of the most exciting ever made . "
He described the plot as " unpretentious and pleasantly devoid of any ' message . ' "
The film continues to receive critical acclaim from modern critics .
The film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes indicates a 93 % approval rating based on 113 reviews with an overall rating of 8.7/10 .
Its consensus states in summary , " A legendarily expansive and ambitious start to the sci - fi saga , George Lucas opened our eyes to the possibilities of blockbuster filmmaking and things have never been the same . "

Andrew Collins of Empire magazine awarded the film five out of five and said , " Star Wars timeless appeal lies in its easily identified , universal archetypes — goodies to root for , baddies to boo , a princess to be rescued and so on — and if it is most obviously dated to the 70s by the special effects , so be it . "
In his 2009 review , Robert Hatch of The Nation called the film " an outrageously successful , what will be called a ' classic , ' compilation of nonsense , largely derived but thoroughly reconditioned .
I doubt that anyone will ever match it , though the imitations must already be on the drawing boards .
" In a more critical review , Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader stated , " None of these characters has any depth , and they 're all treated like the fanciful props and settings . "
Peter Keough of the Boston Phoenix said , " Star Wars is a junkyard of cinematic gimcracks not unlike the Jawas ' heap of purloined , discarded , barely functioning droids . "

The original Star Wars trilogy is considered one of the best film trilogies in history .
Lucas has often stated that the entire trilogy was intended to be considered one film .
However , he said that his story material for Star Wars was too long for a single film , prompting Lucas to split the story into multiple films .
Lucas also stated that the story evolved over time and that " There was never a script completed that had the entire story as it exists now [ in 1983 ] ...
As the stories unfolded , I would take certain ideas and save them ...
I kept taking out all the good parts , and I just kept telling myself I would make other movies someday . "
In early interviews , it was suggested the series might comprise nine or twelve films .
Star Wars launched the careers of Mark Hamill , Harrison Ford , and Carrie Fisher .
Ford , who subsequently starred in the Indiana Jones series ( 1981–2008 ) , Blade Runner ( 1982 ) , and Witness ( 1985 ) after working on the film , told the Daily Mirror that Star Wars " boosted my career " , and said , " I think the great luck of my career is that I 've made these family movies which are introduced to succeeding generations of kids by their families at the time it seems appropriate . "
The film has spawned a series of films consisting of three trilogies ( including the original film ) , anthology films and an extensive media franchise called the Star Wars expanded universe including books , television series , computer and video games , and comic books .
All of the main films have been box office successes , with the overall box office revenue generated by the Star Wars films ( including the theatrical ) totaling over $ 6.5 billion , making it the third highest - grossing film series .
The film also spawned the Star Wars Holiday Special , which debuted on CBS on November 17 , 1978 and is often considered a failure ; Lucas himself disowned it .
The special has never been aired after its original broadcast , and it has never been officially released on home video .
However , many bootleg copies exist , and the special has consequently become something of an underground legend .
A radio drama adaptation of the film was broadcast on the American National Public Radio network in 1981 .
The adaptation was written by Brian Daley and directed by John Madden , and was produced with cooperation from George Lucas , who donated the rights to NPR .
John Williams 's music and Ben Burtt 's sound design were retained for the show , and Mark Hamill ( Luke Skywalker ) and Anthony Daniels ( C-3PO ) reprised their roles .
The radio drama narrative began with a version of the backstory to the film which relates Princess Leia 's acquisition of the secret Death Star plans .
It also featured scenes not seen in the final cut of the film , such as Luke Skywalker 's observation of the space battle above Tatooine through binoculars , a skyhopper race , and Darth Vader 's interrogation of Princess Leia .
The radio version was originally considered to be part of the official Star Wars canon , but has since been supplanted by revised canonical narratives .

POPULAR CULTURE Section::::In
popular culture .
Star Wars and its ensuing film installments have been explicitly referenced and satirized across a wide range of media .
Hardware Wars , released in 1978 , was one of the first fan films to parody Star Wars .
It received positive critical reaction , went to earn over $ 1 million , and is one of Lucas 's favorite Star Wars spoofs .
Writing for The New York Times , Frank DeCaro said , " Star Wars littered pop culture of the late 1970s with a galaxy of space junk . "
He cited Quark ( a short - lived 1977 sitcom that parodies the science fiction genre ) and Donny & Marie ( a 1970s variety show that produced a 10-minute musical adaptation of Star Wars guest starring Daniels and Mayhew ) as " television 's two most infamous examples " .
Mel Brooks 's Spaceballs , a satirical comic science fiction parody , was released in 1987 to mixed reviews .
Lucas permitted Brooks to make a spoof of the film under " one incredibly big restriction : no action figures . "
Contemporary animated comedy TV series Family Guy , Robot Chicken , and
The Simpsons have produced episodes satirizing the film series .
Star Wars , together with Lucas , is the subject of the 2010 documentary film The People vs. George Lucas that details the issues of filmmaking and fanaticism pertaining to the film franchise and its creator .
Many elements of the film have also endured presence in popular culture .
The iconic weapon of choice of the Jedi , the lightsaber , was voted as the most popular weapon in film history in a survey of approximately 2,000 film fans .
Characters such as Darth Vader , Han Solo , and Yoda have become iconic , and all three were named in the top twenty of the British Film Institute 's " Best Sci - Fi Characters of All - Time " list .
The expressions " Evil empire " and " May the Force be with you " have become part of the popular lexicon .
A pun on the latter phrase has led to May 4 being regarded by many fans of the franchise as an unofficial Star Wars Day .
To commemorate the film 's 30th anniversary in May 2007 , the United States Postal Service issued a set of 15 stamps depicting the characters of the franchise .
Approximately 400 mailboxes across the country were also designed to look like R2-D2 .
CINEMATIC INFLUENCE Section::::Cinematic influence .
Film critic Roger Ebert wrote in his book The Great Movies , " Like The Birth of a Nation and Citizen Kane , Star Wars was a technical watershed that influenced many of the movies that came after .
" It began a new generation of special effects and high - energy motion pictures .
The film was one of the first films to link genres together to invent a new , high - concept genre for filmmakers to build upon .
Finally , along with Steven Spielberg 's Jaws , it shifted the film industry 's focus away from personal filmmaking of the 1970s and towards fast - paced , big - budget blockbusters for younger audiences .
Filmmakers who have said to have been influenced by Star Wars include James Cameron , J.J. Abrams , Damon Lindelof , Dean Devlin , Gareth Edwards , Roland Emmerich , John Lasseter , David Fincher , Peter Jackson , Joss Whedon , Christopher Nolan , Ridley Scott , John Singleton , and Kevin Smith .
Scott , Cameron , and Jackson were influenced by Lucas 's concept of the " used future " ( where vehicles and culture are obviously dated ) and extended the concept for their films , such as Scott 's science fiction films
Alien ( 1979 ) and Blade Runner ( 1982 ) , Cameron 's acclaimed sequel Aliens ( 1986 ) and his earlier breakthrough film
The Terminator ( 1984 ) .
Jackson used the concept for his production of The Lord of the Rings trilogy to add a sense of realism and believability .
Christopher Nolan cited Star Wars as an influence when making the 2010 blockbuster film , Inception .
Some critics have blamed Star Wars , as well as Jaws , for ruining Hollywood by shifting its focus from " sophisticated " films such as The Godfather , Taxi Driver , and Annie Hall to films about spectacle and juvenile fantasy .
One such critic , Peter Biskind , complained , " When all was said and done , Lucas and Spielberg returned the 1970s audience , grown sophisticated on a diet of European and New Hollywood films , to the simplicities of the pre-1960s Golden Age of movies ...
They marched backward through the looking - glass .
" In an opposing view , Tom Shone wrote that through Star Wars and Jaws , Lucas and Spielberg " did n't betray cinema at all : they plugged it back into the grid , returning the medium to its roots as a carnival sideshow , a magic act , one big special effect " , which was " a kind of rebirth " .
RECOGNITION Section::::Recognition .
In its May 30 , 1977 issue , the film 's year of release , Time magazine named Star Wars the " Movie of the Year " .
The publication claimed it was a " big early supporter " of the vision which would become Star Wars .
In an article intended for the cover of the issue , Times Gerald Clarke wrote that Star Wars is " a grand and glorious film that may well be the smash hit of 1977 , and certainly is the best movie of the year so far .
The result is a remarkable confection : a subliminal history of the movies , wrapped in a riveting tale of suspense and adventure , ornamented with some of the most ingenious special effects ever contrived for film .
" Each of the subsequent films of the Star Wars saga has appeared on the magazine 's cover .
Star Wars was voted the second most popular film by Americans in a 2008 nationwide poll conducted by the market research firm , Harris Interactive .
Star Wars has also been featured in several high - profile audience polls : in 1997 , it ranked as the 10th Greatest American Film on the Los Angeles Daily News
Readers ' Poll ; in 2002 , the film and its sequel The Empire Strikes Back were voted as the greatest films ever made in Channel 4 's 100 Greatest Films poll ; in 2011 , it ranked as Best Sci - Fi Film on , a primetime special aired by ABC that counted down the best films as chosen by fans , based on results of a poll conducted by ABC and People magazine ; in 2014 the film placed 11th in a poll undertaken by The Hollywood Reporter , which balloted every studio , agency , publicity firm , and production house in the Hollywood region .
Reputable publications also have included Star Wars in their best films lists : in 2008 , Empire magazine ranked Star Wars at No . 22 on its list of the " 500 Greatest Movies of All Time " ; in 2010 , the film ranked among the " All - Time 100 " list of the greatest films as chosen by Time magazine film critic Richard Schickel ; the film was also placed on a similar list created by The New York Times , " The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made " ; in 2012 , the film was included in Sight & Sounds prestigious decennial critics poll " Critics ' Top 250 Films " , ranking at 171st on the list , and in their directors poll at 224th .
Lucas 's original screenplay was selected by the Writers Guild of America as the 68th greatest of all time .
In 1989 , the United States Library of Congress named Star Wars among its first selections to the National Film Registry as being " culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant " ; at the time , it was the most recent film to be selected and it was the only film from the 1970s to be chosen .
Although Lucas declined to provide the Library with a workable copy of the original film upon request ( instead offering the Special Edition ) , a viewable scan was made of the original copyright deposit print .
The soundtrack was added to the United States National Recording Registry 15 years later ( in 2004 ) .
The lack of a commercially available version of the 1977 original theatrical edit of the film since early ' 80s VHS releases has spawned numerous restorations by disgruntled fans over the years , such as Harmy 's Despecialized Edition .
In addition to the film 's multiple awards and nominations , Star Wars has also been recognized by the American Film Institute on several of its lists .
The film ranks first on 100 Years of Film Scores , second on Top 10 Sci - Fi Films , 15th on 100 Years ...
100 Movies ( ranked 13th on the updated 10th anniversary edition ) , 27th on 100 Years ... 100 Thrills , and 39th on 100 Years ... 100 Cheers .
