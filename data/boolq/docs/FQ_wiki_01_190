Graduate certificates are available in a limited range of subjects that are typically work - related , for example psychology , management , counselling or law .
Graduate certificates are normally taken by those who have already graduated with a bachelor 's degree in another discipline ( hence the name ) .
This qualification should not be confused with postgraduate certificates or postgraduate diplomas , which are master 's degree - level qualification , or with certificates of Higher Education , which are lower - level qualifications normally taken by those without previous HE qualification .
