FRUIT TREE POLLINATION
Pollination of fruit trees is required to produce seeds with surrounding fruit .
It is the process of moving pollen from the anther to the stigma , either in the same flower or in another flower .
Some tree species , including many fruit trees , do not produce fruit from self - pollination , so pollinizer trees are planted in orchards .
The pollination process requires a carrier for the pollen , which can be animal , wind , or human intervention ( by hand - pollination or by using a pollen sprayer ) .
Cross pollination produces seeds with a different genetic makeup from the parent plants ; such seeds may be created deliberately as part of a selective breeding program for fruit trees with desired attributes .
Trees that are cross - pollinated or pollinated via an insect pollinator produce more fruit than trees with flowers that just self - pollinate .
In fruit trees , bees are an essential part of the pollination process for the formation of fruit .
Pollination of fruit trees around the world has been highly studied for hundreds of years .
There is a lot of information known about fruit tree pollination from temperate climates , but very little information known about fruit tree pollination from tropical climates .
Fruits from temperate climates include apples , pears , plums , peaches , cherries , berries , grapes , and nuts which are considered dry fruits .
Fruits from tropical climates include bananas , pineapples , papayas , passion fruit , avocado , mango , and members of the genus
Citrus .
APPLE Section::::Apple .
Most apple plants /
trees are self - incompatible , that is , they do not produce fruit when pollinated from a flower of the same tree or from another tree of the same cultivar , and must be cross pollinated .
A few are described as " self - fertile " and are capable of self - pollination , although even those tend to carry larger crops when cross pollinated from a suitable pollenizer .
A relatively small number of cultivars are " triploid " , meaning that they provide almost no viable pollen for themselves or other apple trees .
Apples that can pollinate one another are grouped by the time they flower
so cross - pollinators are in bloom at the same time .
Pollination management is an important component of apple culture .
Before planting , it is important to arrange for pollenizers - varieties of apple or crabapple that provide plentiful , viable and compatible pollen .
Orchard blocks may alternate rows of compatible varieties , or may plant crabapple trees , or graft on limbs of crabapple .
Some varieties produce very little pollen , or the pollen is sterile , so these are not good pollenizers .
Good - quality nurseries have pollenizer compatibility lists .
Growers with old orchard blocks of single varieties sometimes provide bouquets of crabapple blossoms in drums or pails in the orchard for pollenizers .
Home growers with a single tree and no other variety in the neighborhood can do the same on a smaller scale .
During the bloom each season , commercial apple growers usually provide pollinators to carry the pollen .
Honeybee hives are most commonly used in the United States , and arrangements may be made with a commercial beekeeper who supply hives for a fee .
Honeybees of the genus Apis are the most common pollinator for apple trees , although members of the genera Andrena , Bombus , Halictus , and Osmia pollinate apple trees in the wild .
Solitary bees such as ground - nesting mining bees ( Andrena ) may play a far bigger role in pollination than at one time suspected .
Bumble bees are sometimes present in orchards , but not usually in enough quantity to be significant pollinators ; in the home garden with only a few trees , their role may be much greater .
Increasingly Orchard bees ( spring mason bees ) are being used in fruit tree pollination .
According to British writer Christopher O'Toole in his book
The Red Mason Bee , Osmia rufa is a much more efficient pollinator of orchard crops ( in Europe ) than honey bees .
Both O. rufa and O. cornuta are used in Europe , while in western North America , the " Blue Orchard Bee " ( Osmia lignaria , more black than blue in color ) is a proven orchard pollinator .
In Japan , the Japanese Orchard Bee — the hornfaced bee , Osmia cornifrons — provides up to 80 % of the apple pollination .
Beyond Japan , Osmia cornifrons is also used increasingly in the eastern US , because like other mason bees it is up to 100 times more efficient than the honeybee — a mere 600 hornfaced bees being required per hectare , as opposed to tens of thousands of honeybees .
Home growers may find these more acceptable in suburban locations because they rarely sting .
Symptoms of inadequate pollination are small and misshapen apples , and slowness to ripen .
The seeds can be counted to evaluate pollination .
Well - pollinated apples have best quality , and will have seven to ten seeds .
Apples with fewer than three seeds will usually not mature and will drop from the trees in the early summer .
Inadequate pollination can result from either a lack of pollinators or pollenizers , or from poor pollinating weather at bloom time .
Multiple bee visits are usually required to deliver sufficient grains of pollen to accomplish complete pollination .
ALMONDS Section::::Almonds .
The blossoms of most California Almond varieties are self - incompatible , requiring cross - pollination with other varieties to produce a crop .
The single most important factor determining a good yield is pollination during the bloom period .
More than a million colonies of honey bees are placed in California Almond orchards at the beginning of the bloom period to pollinate the crop .
California beekeepers alone can not supply this critical need , which is why honey bees travel across the country to the San Joaqin Valley each year .
Although the recommended number of hives per acre is 2 to 3 , due to the high demand in conjunction with the reduced availability of commercial beehives , many almond growers have to make do with a lower hive density during pollination .
These growers started using semiochemical formulations , like SPLAT Bloom , to compensate for the low hive density .
SPLAT Bloom manipulates the behavior of the bees , inciting them to spend more time foraging , and thus pollinating flowers in the entire almond orchard ( increasing pollination and fruit set ) , not only close to the hive .
Research into self - fertile almonds has led to the development of several almond varieties that do not need a pollinator tree .
Working from an old Spanish variety , " Tuono " , researchers in 2008 started making available new self - fertile varieties that more closely match the qualities of the popular " Nonpareil " almond — including varieties " Lone Star " and " Independence " .
While self - fertile trees do not require pollen from a second tree variety for fruit / nut set , they still depend upon insect pollination for good production .
Almond growers with self - fertile almonds report excellent nut set with half ( or less )
the number of bees in the field .
PEAR Section::::Pear .
Like apples , pears are self - incompatible and need to attract insects in order to be pollinated and produce fruit .
One notable difference from apples is that pear blossoms are much less attractive to bees due to their pale coloring and light odor .
Bees may abandon the pear blossoms to visit dandelions or a nearby apple orchard .
The majority of pollinators of pear trees are honey bees , although pears are also visited by blow flies and hoverflies .
A way to combat the low attraction of honey bees to pear blossoms is to use bee attractants to entice the bees to pollinate the flowers .
Bee attractants may include pheromones that mimic the brood pheromone or the juvenile pheromone , or other attractants .
There are also other methods for attracting honey bees to pear blossoms .
One is saturation pollination , that is to stock so many bees that all area blossoms are worked regardless of the attractiveness to the bees .
Another method is to delay the movement of the beehives into the orchards until there is about 30 percent bloom .
The bees are moved into the orchard during the night and will usually visit the pear blossoms for a few hours until they discover the richer nectar sources .
The recommended number of hives per acre is one .
CITRUS Section::::Citrus .
Many citrus cultivars are seedless and are produced parthenocarpically without pollination .
Some cultivars may be capable of producing fruit either way , having seeds in the segments , if pollinated , and no seeds if not .
Citrus that requires pollination may be self - compatible , thus pollen must be moved only a short distance from the anther to the stigma by a pollinator .
Some citrus , such as Meyer Lemons , are popular container plants .
When these bloom indoors , they often suffer from blossom drop because no pollinators have access .
Hand pollination by a human pollinator is a solution .
A few citrus , including some tangelos and tangerines , are self - incompatible , and require cross pollination .
Pollinizers must be planned when groves are planted .
Managed honeybee hives at bloom time are often used to ensure adequate pollination .
