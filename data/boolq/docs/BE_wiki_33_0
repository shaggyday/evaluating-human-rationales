PROFESSIONAL CAREER TORONTO RAPTORS ( 1998–2004 )
Section::::Professional career .
Section::::Toronto Raptors ( 1998–2004 ) .
Carter was initially drafted by the Golden State Warriors with the fifth overall pick in the 1998 NBA draft .
He was then traded to the Toronto Raptors for the fourth overall pick , Antawn Jamison — Carter 's college teammate and good friend .
The Raptors had struggled in their first three years as a franchise .
Carter was instrumental in leading the Raptors to their first ever playoff appearance in 2000 before going on to lead them to a 47-win season and their first ever playoff series win in 2001 , advancing them to the Eastern Conference Semifinals .
Due to the NBA lockout , Carter 's rookie season did not start until January 1999 .
Carter quickly became a fan favorite with a soaring offensive game that earned him the nickname " Air Canada " .
He won NBA Rookie of the Year Award after averaging 18.3 points and throwing down countless highlight - reel dunks .
Carter ascended to full - fledged stardom in his second season – he averaged 25.7 points per game ( fourth - highest in the league ) and lifted Toronto to its first playoff appearance in franchise history .
He subsequently earned his first NBA All - Star selection and was named to the All - NBA Third Team .
During the 2000 NBA All - Star Weekend , Carter showcased arguably the most memorable Slam Dunk Contest event in its history .
He won the contest by performing an array of dunks including a 360 ° windmill , a between the legs bounce dunk , and an " elbow in the rim " dunk ( also known as a " cookie jar " dunk or the " honey dip " ) .
Carter and his distant cousin Tracy McGrady formed a formidable one - two punch as teammates in Toronto between 1998 and 2000 .
However , McGrady was dealt to the Orlando Magic in August 2000 , leaving Carter as the Raptors ' franchise player .
It is believed by some that the Raptors could have won championships if McGrady and Carter stayed together in Toronto .
In 2000–01 , his third season , Carter averaged a career - high 27.6 points per game , made the All - NBA Second Team , and was voted in as a starter for the 2001 NBA All - Star Game .
The Raptors also finished the regular season with a then franchise - record 47 wins .
In the playoffs , the Raptors beat the New York Knicks 3–2 in the first round , and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals to face off against the Philadelphia 76ers .
Carter and Allen Iverson played in a seven - game series that see - sawed back and forth .
Carter scored 50 points in Game 3 and set an NBA playoff record for most three - point field goals made in one game .
Television ratings for Game 7 soared as one of the highest watched in NBC 's history for a non - finals game .
As the Sixers and Raptors increased their double team pressures on Carter and Iverson respectively , the game winning shot came down to Carter who missed with 2.0 seconds remaining .
Iverson said of the series in July 2011 : " It was incredible .
( Carter ) had great games at home
and I had some great games at home , but both of us were just trying to put our teams on our back and win basketball games .
It is great just having those memories and being a part of something like that . "
In August 2001 , Carter signed a six - year contract extension worth as much as $ 94 million .
However , Carter began showing the effects of what would become career - altering problems with his knees in the wake of his big contract .
He earned a reputation as a fragile player after suffering a series of knee and hamstring injuries .
Carter missed the final 22 games of the 2001–02 regular season due to injury .
He started in 60 games and averaged 24.7 points per game .
On December 7 , 2001 , Carter recorded 42 points , 15 rebounds , 6 assists and 5 steals against the Denver Nuggets .
He joined Charles Barkley ( 1988 ) as the only two players to have ever posted a game with 40 points , 15 rebounds , five steals and five assists , dating back to the 1973–74 season , when the league officially began tracking steals .
He was voted into the 2002 NBA All - Star Game , but he could not participate due to injury .
Without Carter during the 2002 NBA Playoffs , the Raptors were defeated in five games by the Detroit Pistons in the first round .
Following off - season surgery , Carter only managed 43 games during the 2002–03 season .
In February 2003 , Carter gave up his starting spot in the 2003 NBA All - Star Game to Michael Jordan to allow Jordan to make his final start as an All - Star .
Carter played in 73 games during the 2003–04 season , but the Raptors fell three games short of making the playoffs .
TRADE TO THE NETS Section::::Trade to the Nets .
During the 2004 off - season , general manager Glen Grunwald and the entire coaching staff were fired following the team 's failure to reach the playoffs .
Carter became frustrated with the Raptors ' upper management .
In particular , Carter was unhappy with Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment ( MLSE ) and Raptors president Richard Peddie .
In a private meeting , Peddie reassured Carter that MLSE was serious in building a contender in Toronto and that he would pursue established players like point guard Steve Nash and center Jamaal Magloire .
Carter was also given the impression that Peddie would consider Julius Erving as a serious candidate for general manager ; however , it was later disclosed that Erving was never really in the mix .
Peddie instead hired Rob Babcock as general manager , whose first priority in rebuilding the Raptors was to " establish our philosophy " , stating " we are not really worried about how many wins we get right away , or whether we make the playoffs within the first year or two . "
He then hired Sam Mitchell as head coach .
Consequently , much speculation arose whether Carter wanted to be traded .
The Toronto Sun reported that Carter felt misled and felt the Raptors would never be an elite team under the current MLSE structure with Peddie as Raptors president .
Some fans raised money to fly a " Keep Vince , Trade Peddie " banner over the Air Canada Centre just before Carter 's annual charity game .
When Rob Babcock was questioned about the trade speculations , he denied Carter asked for a trade but indiscreetly revealed Carter 's agent had approached him for a trade request .
During the 2004–05 season , coach Mitchell often benched Carter in the fourth quarter to emphasize the new team philosophy he and Babcock wanted players to adapt to , spurring rumors of fights between Carter and Mitchell and new point guard Rafer Alston .
Carter 's trade wish was finally granted on December 17 , 2004 , when he was dealt to the New Jersey Nets for Alonzo Mourning , Aaron Williams , Eric Williams and two first round draft picks .
In his first game back in Toronto , on April 15 , 2005 , Carter was heavily booed and jeered by Raptors fans ; some fans were found burning Vince Carter jerseys , while many donned No . 15 baby bibs , ' FUVC ' T - shirts , and other merchandise that labelled Carter as " Wince " or as " immature " , alluding to Carter 's knee and ankle injuries and his dissent .
Much like former Raptors teammate Tracy McGrady , Carter received such treatment for years to come in the town that once embraced him .
In January 2005 , Carter was asked if he had pushed himself as hard as he should have in Toronto .
Carter replied , " In years past , no .
I was fortunate to have the talent ...
you get spoiled when you 're able to do a lot of things .
You see that you do n't have to work at it .
Now , with the all the injuries , I have to work harder .
I 'm a little hungrier .
Getting a fresh start has made me want to attack the basket . "
Though Carter 's comments were perceived by Raptors fans as his confession of quitting on the Raptors , Thompson said the comments were misinterpreted , saying , " That boy never said to me , ' Coach , I just laid down and quit . '
...
I was embarrassed and felt awful about it for his sake , because I knew what he was communicating to me ...
he was more expressing a desire of wanting to do better , as we all do . "
Despite Thompson 's defense of Carter , the Toronto Stars Dave Feschuk in 2007 wrote that Carter " cheated on ( the Raptors ) .
He quit on the floor . "
Carter later stated his comments were misconstrued .
On the eve of the Raptors – Nets playoff series in 2007 , Carter told New York 's WFAN radio station , " One day , maybe the fans will understand how it all went down .
That 's all I can say . "
In November 2011 , Carter , along with his cousin Tracy McGrady and Charles Oakley , addressed the Toronto audience in an interview on Off the Record with Michael Landsberg .
When asked about being booed in Toronto , Carter said , " They watched myself and Tracy grow up .
And when we left they still got to see ( us )
flourish and become ( who we are ) .
For me , I looked at it as , a young child growing up into a grown man and moving on .
And I get it .
Leaving , hurt a lot of people .
It hurt me because I tell you what ...
I accomplished a lot
, I learned a lot ,
I became the person and player of who I am today because of that experience , through the coaches , players , and everything else .
I get it ...
but regardless I still love the city .
I have friends there and my heart is still there because that 's where it all started . "
Later in the interview , when asked about any words to the Toronto fans , Carter said , " I appreciate the fans and whether you cheer for me , boo me , or hate me , I still love you .
Toronto 's one of the best kept secrets .. puts one of the best products on the floor and one of the top places to play in . "
On November 6 , 2012 , in an interview with TSN Radio 1050 , Carter reiterated his love for the city and his appreciation for the Toronto Raptors organization .
The next day , Sam Mitchell and Rob Babcock revealed on Sportsnet 590 , The Fan that the night before Carter was traded to New Jersey , Carter phoned Mitchell to express his desire to stay in Toronto and commit to their vision for the team .
However , Babcock said it was too late and the trade had already been verbally agreed upon .
Looking back on it , Mitchell feels he should have personally contacted the MLSE chairman , Larry Tanenbaum , but was reluctant because he did not want to break the chain of command .
Raptors general manager Masai Ujiri referred to Carter in April 2014 as " one of the symbols of the Toronto Raptors .
" To this day , Carter remains the Raptors ' all - time leader in points per game with 23.4 , having amassed 9,420 points during his -year run in Toronto .
RAPTORS ' 20TH ANNIVERSARY Section::::Raptors ' 20th anniversary .
On November 19 , 2014 , nearly a decade after the trade , as a part of the Raptors ' 20th anniversary celebration , the team paid tribute to Carter with a video montage during the first quarter of the Raptors - Grizzlies game .
Leading up to the game , questions were raised about how Raptors fans would receive the planned video tribute .
As the sellout crowd watched the video tribute featuring highlights of Carter 's high - flying Raptors days , what began as the usual booing turned into an overwhelmingly positive standing ovation .
An emotional Carter used his warm - up shirt to wipe tears running down his face as he pointed to his heart and waved to the fans in appreciation .
He later stated , " It was a great feeling , I could n't write it any better . "

He celebrated explosive dunks with his patented " Crank it up " celebration , which is expressed by rolling his wrists as if revving the engine of a motorcycle .
