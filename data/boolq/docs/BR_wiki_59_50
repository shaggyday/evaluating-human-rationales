MAZDA6
The Mazda 6 or Mazda6 ( known as the Mazda Atenza in China and Japan , derived from the Italian attenzione ) is a mid - size car produced by Mazda since 2002 .
It replaced the long - produced Capella/626 in 2002 .
The Mazda6 sold more than one million units faster than all previous Mazdas .
The Mazda6 was marketed as the first example of the company 's Stylish , Insightful , and Spirited design philosophy followed by the Mazda2 in December 2002 , the RX-8 in August 2003 , the Mazda3 in January 2004 , the Mazda5 in the summer of 2005 , the MX-5 in October 2005 , and the CX-7 in November 2006 .
The 2003 Mazda6 is essentially the 6th generation Mazda 626 as the Mazda6 continues on the G Platform , progressing from the GF - platform 626 / Capella to the GG - platform Mazda6 .
FIRST GENERATION
( GG1 ; 2002–2008 )
Section::::First generation ( GG1 ; 2002–2008 ) .
The first generation Mazda6 was launched in Japan as the Mazda Atenza in May 2002 .
The model lineup consisted of a four - door sedan , a four door hatchback and a five - door wagon , marketed in North America as the " Sport Sedan " , " 5-Door " and " Sport Wagon " , respectively .
In Australia , the lineup was first available in Limited trim , as a sedan ; in Classic trim as sedan , hatch or wagon and in Luxury trim as sedan and liftback — and Luxury Sports trim , as a liftback .
In New Zealand the lineup consisted of 2.0L GLX ( sedan only ) , 2.3L GSX ( sedan , liftback , and wagon ) , and the 2.3L Limited ( sedan and liftback ) .
Its arrival in Japan signified a new consolidated approach as compared to previous large luxury sedans previously offered , such as the Mazda Sentia and the Mazda Millenia , as well as giving the Mazda Capella a refreshed appearance .
The Atenza continues luxury car offerings to Japanese buyers due to dimensions placing it in the larger " normal size " classification , according to Japanese Government dimension regulations .
In North America , the first generation was marketed as a 2003 model in the United States and as a 2004 model in Canada .
In Europe , the luxury sports model was available as a direct injection turbodiesel
( " DITD " ) estate up until 2007 .
As of 2008 , the European Mazda catalog lists only the " Sport " version of the turbodiesel estate , while the " Luxury Sport " version has been dropped .
Drivetrain combinations include the Mazda MZR engine in configurations of 1.8 L ( L8-DE ) , 2.0 L ( LF - VE ) and 2.3 L ( L3-VE ) , initially with a five - speed manual or four - speed automatic transmission ( with sequential - automatic option , dubbed the " Four - Speed Sport AT " ) .
In the US domestic market a 3.0 L Duratec 30 V6 engine is also available with a five - speed manual or five - speed automatic ( with sequential - automatic option , dubbed the " 5-Speed Sport AT " ) .
European and Australian versions also feature a four - cylinder turbodiesel that comes with a six - speed manual transmission and produces significantly more torque than the V6 , with much improved fuel economy .
In North America , the 5-speed automatic optional on the V6 models is replaced by an Aisin 6-speed automatic for 2005 model year .
The four - cylinder model receives a Jatco five - speed automatic in the following year .
Power is directed to the front wheels in most markets , although full - time all - wheel - drive models are available in Japan , Europe and Australia .
Not all configurations are available in all areas – for example , the Mazda 6 as released in Australia is available in 2.3L four - cylinder guise only , while the 626 which it replaced was available with a choice of four- or six - cylinder engines .
The MZI V6 engine was only fitted to vehicles manufactured at Mazda 's Flat Rock Assembly Plant and destined for the U.S. and Canadian domestic markets .
Just as before the Mazda 626 was renamed to Mazda6
Atenza , Ford continues to use the Mazda 's G - series platform for the basis of a number of its CD3 platform coded vehicles , including the Ford Fusion , Mercury Milan , Lincoln Zephyr / MKZ , Lincoln MKX , and a range of SUVs and minivans .
Ford also plans to offer a hybrid powertrain on the platform .
The official Mazda chassis codes are GG ( saloon / hatch ) and GY ( estate ) series – following the 626 / Capella in its GF / GW series .
Mazda 's Hofu Plant in Yamaguchi Prefecture , Japan produced the Mazda6 for international markets from February 2002 to August 2007 .
In North America , Mazda6 production was handled at the AutoAlliance International plant in Flat Rock , Michigan .
The first Mazda 6 rolled off the AAI assembly line on October 1 , 2002 , one month after 626 production ended .
There are also satellite plants building Mazda 6 models in China and Thailand for their respective local markets .
In September 2005 , all Australian Mazda 6s received a facelift which included a feature upgrade , 5-speed auto and 6-speed manual transmissions , standard 16- or 17-inch alloy wheels and minor bodywork upgrades .
In China , the Mazda6 was introduced by FAW Mazda in 2003 .
Despite the release of its successors , the first generation car , known locally as the Maliu ( 马六 , " Horse 6 " ) , continues to be manufactured at FAW 's Changchun plant , having sold over 770,000 units as of 2014 .
This model is also used as the base for the FAW Benteng , also known as Besturn B70 or Hongqi C301 .
MAZDA6 MPS Section::::Mazda6 MPS .
The 2006 Mazdaspeed Atenza ( known as Mazdaspeed6 in North America and Mazda6 MPS in Europe , South Africa and Australia ) is a high - performance version of the Mazda6 .
Its mission statement was written with the help of Peter Birtwhistle , chief of Mazda 's advanced design studio in Germany at the time .
It was initially unveiled as a concept at the 2002 Paris show .
It features a turbocharged version of the 2.3 L MZR I4 which produces 272 PS ( 200 kW )
( European version is detuned to 260 PS ( 191 kW ) ; the North American version , at 274 hp ( 204 kW ) , revised to for 2007 ) .
All models have of torque .
This 2.3 L DISI turbocharged engine features direct fuel injection and conforms to the new Euro 5 emissions standards .
It has a revised front fascia with a raised hood , a 6-speed manual transmission , and all - wheel drive .
The all - wheel - drive system uses Mazda 's Active Torque Split computer - based control , which routes up to 50 % of the power to the rear wheels depending on driving conditions .
Originally scheduled to be launched in June 2005 , the Mazdaspeed Atenza was delayed until November .
In North America , the Mazdaspeed6 comes in two trim levels ; the " Sport " trim with cloth interior and standard key entry and ignition ; and the " Grand Touring " trim with leather interior , keyless entry / ignition , and an optional DVD navigation .

The Atenza Wagon also won What Car ? 's Best Estate award in 2004 .
Also the Mazda6 won the 2003 Semperit Irish Car of the Year .
The Mazda6 won the ' Best Mid - size Car ( over $ 28,000 ) ' title in Australia 's Best Cars in 2002 and 2003 .

The Mazda6 also won " Best Family Sedan " in MotorWeek 's 2009 Driver 's Choice Awards .
The Mazda 6 was praised for its edgy handsome design , communicative steering and tight suspension .
However , as it was designed as a world car in order to fit the needs of Europe and Japan , it was smaller than its North American contemporaries in the midsize segment , being criticized for its reduced passenger space .
Its acceleration , particularly the V6 engine models , lagged behind that of its rivals as well .
The hatchback 's liftback / notchback styling was considered a clever design to disguise it as a four - door saloon , as North Americans generally considered trunks more elegant than hatches .
The estate had an early demise , but the hatchback was somewhat successful in Canada , especially in Québec , though it would not have a 2009 refresh , as both models were unpopular in the US .
SECOND GENERATION ( GH1 ; 2007–2012 )
Section::::Second generation ( GH1 ; 2007–2012 ) .
The second generation Mazda6 made its premiere at the 2007 Frankfurt Auto Show in September .
The new Mazda6 is based on the Mazda GH chassis platform , a revised version of the GG chassis which Ford also still uses as their CD3 platform .
Mazda continues to provide three body styles , including 4-door saloon ( sedan ) , 5-door hatchback and wagon .
A number of journalists have already praised its electrically assisted steering for being considerably improved compared to the previous generation , providing more feedback to the driver .
The hatchback model even has a trunk space which beats the larger rival Ford Mondeo and Opel / Vauxhall Insignia ( hatchback ) by 200 liters with rear seats folded down .
This model of the Mazda6 was awarded 2010 Family Car of the Year by What Car ? magazine .
At the 2010 Geneva Motor Show , Mazda announced their new 2011 Mazda6 .
In China , over 680,000 Mazdas , including Mazda6 made between September 2008 and January 2016 , were recalled due to faulty air bags .
An earlier recall involved 280,000 Mazda6 models made between 2003 and 2008 for a similar issue .
The recall was issued the same day the Chinese peak quality watchdog requested General Motors , Mercedes - Benz and Volkswagen recall vehicles with faulty air bags in China .
NORTH AMERICA Section::::North America .
The North American version was redesigned for the 2009 model year , with the wagon version being dropped there .
It is a widened and lengthened version of the model sold elsewhere , with larger engines .

In America , only a sedan model was available ( In Middle East , USDM Mazda 6 known as Mazda 6 Ultra is sold alongside the JDM Mazda 6 ) .
A Mazdaspeed 6 variant was not offered .
Despite the North American version 's increase in dimensions , Mazda maintains that the 6 retains the overall driving experience is still sportier than rivaling Honda Accords , Toyota Camrys , or Chevrolet Malibus .

On March 3 , 2011 , around 50,000 Mazda6 vehicles from the 2009–10 model years were recalled in the United States , with another 15,000 in Canada , Mexico and Puerto Rico after it was found that Yellow Sac Spiders were building nests in the fuel line of the vehicles .
The Mazda6 has two pipes coming from its gas tank , an extremely rare configuration .
The amount of gasoline vapor in the fuel line is just strong enough to draw the spider in but not strong enough to kill it .
On April 5 , 2014 , Mazda reissued the same recall for spiders against all 2010–2012 Mazda6 vehicles with 2.5 liter engines .

North American SKYACTIV - G 2.5-liter gasoline engine models were set to go on sale in January 2013 as 2014 model year vehicle , followed by SKYACTIV - D engine models in second half of 2013 .
However the introduction of the diesel variant of Mazda6 to the U.S. market was delayed from the second half of 2013 to spring 2014 due to emission issue .
In early 2014 , it is reported that the introduction of the diesel engine has been delayed again , effectively cancelling the program for at least this generation of the model .
The engine is already available on both the Asian and European models of the third generation Mazda6 .
Notably , the North American models are no longer offered with a V6 engine putting the model at a disadvantage .
The 2.5 L produces and has an EPA rating of City and Highway ( with the 6-speed automatic ) .

The North American 2016 Mazda6
Grand Touring trim introduced LED Headlights in lieu of bi - xenon HID headlights , new LED daytime running lights and LED foglights .
The North American 2016 Mazda6
Grand Touring trim with Technology Package also introduced Smart Brake Support ( SBS ) which is different than Smart City Brake Support ( SCBS ) which was introduced in earlier Mazda models such as the CX-5 .
Although the two systems are similarly named , they perform different functions at different speed ranges .
* Smart City Brake Support uses a windshield mounted laser that measures the distance to a car in front , works with car braking systems at speeds below 19 mph ( 30 km / h ) to avoid or reduce the severity of a rear - end collision .
If the SCBS laser detects imminent collision conditions , the braking system is prepared to deliver full stopping power , the engine speed is reduced , and if necessary , brakes are applied .
* The similarly named Smart Brake Support uses a millimeter wave radar to measure distances to the next car as far as ahead , at speeds up to 90 mph ( 145 km / h ) .
The SBS radar inputs can be used for adaptive cruise control inputs to allow for safe following distances using cruise control throttle and brake inputs , and in the event of a potential collision , SBS can apply brakes and slow the car for collision avoidance or collision severity mitigation .
*
In all instances , the driver is given audible and visual warnings when either SCBS or SBS are activated .
The systems only take over if no driver response is detected .
Production of all North American models was transferred to Hofu , Japan , due to ongoing efforts to increase global manufacturing efficiencies .
* MY 2017 ( started 05/2016 ) became GL as family code .
Only reason for new GL code : new Mazda maintenance strategy , to prevent confusion in these Mazda data systems the GJ is split from GL .
The GL is same platform as GJ with minor MY changes like , new steering wheel , better doors sound isolation , G - Vectoring Control GVC system .
( source : Mazda importer The Netherlands ) I - ELOOP Section::::i - ELOOP .
The North American 2014 Mazda6
Grand Touring trim with Technology Package
introduced the Mazda i - ELOOP ( intelligent - Energy Loop ) technology .
* i - ELOOP is a unique regenerative engine braking system that uses the free wheeling alternator to capture energy when you lift your foot off the accelerator .
*
The captured energy is stored in a capacitor , and that stored energy is then used to power the car 's electrical components — from the AC to the power steering — and in turn , improves real – world fuel efficiency by as much as 5 percent .
The i - ELOOP equipped cars , which also use active grill shutters at highway speeds , claim an EPA mileage rating of City/ Highway , 2 mpg better EPA mileage ratings than the standard gasoline engine Mazda6 with 26/38 .
The significance of the capacitor system is that the capacitor can store in seconds enough energy to run the car electronics for about several minutes .
*
The capacitor system offers large weight and space savings over batteries .
i - ELOOP also achieves better gas mileage by disengaging the energy sapping alternator during acceleration , i - ELOOP is an innovative use of existing alternator waste energy in deceleration mode , which can happen more frequently than regenerative braking , common in hybrid cars .
* i - ELOOP is representative of the " different " thinking applied by Mazda engineers to age old problems .
While not the case now , it is possible that this type capacitor technology could become part of a suite of energy saving tools used in any type of car , electric , hybrid , etc . , similar to the engine stop start technologies that are widely applied in cars today .
