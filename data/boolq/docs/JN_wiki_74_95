2017 CLEVELAND BROWNS SEASON
The 2017 season was the Cleveland Browns ' 69th as a professional sports franchise , their 65th season as a member of the National Football League , their second under head coach Hue Jackson and their second and final season under GM Sashi Brown .
The Browns failed to improve upon their 1–15 record from the previous season , losing all sixteen games in 2017 and continuing a losing streak dating to the final game of the previous season .
They became the second team in NFL history to go 0–16
after the 2008 Detroit Lions .
The Browns became the twelfth NFL team to have gone winless playing eight games or more and the fourth since the AFL - NFL merger in 1970 .
In going 0–16 , the Browns became the first franchise in NFL history to have multiple seasons with 15 or more losses and the first to start consecutive seasons with at least 14 losses .
They were mathematically eliminated from the AFC North title contention in Week 11 , extending an active NFL record drought of 25 consecutive seasons without a division title .
They were then eliminated from playoff contention in Week 12 , extending their franchise record playoff drought to 15 consecutive seasons .
With the Buffalo Bills qualifying for the postseason for the first time since 1999 , the Browns now have the longest postseason drought in the NFL and the second longest in the four major American sports leagues , only behind the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball .
The Browns finished 4th place in the AFC North for the seventh consecutive season in addition to finishing the season with a losing record for the tenth consecutive season , extending a franchise record .
It was the first season in which the team lost every home game since 1999 .
The Browns also extended their road losing streak to 21 games and their losing streak within the division to 17 games , both date back to the 2015 season .
A Week 13 loss moved the Browns to 1–27 in their first 28 games under Jackson , surpassing the 1976–77 Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the worst 28 game start ( 2–26 ) for a regime in NFL history .
The Browns finished the 2017 season with a combined record of 1–31 over the previous two seasons , an NFL record for worst winning percentage over any two season span .
After starting 2014 with a 6–3 record heading into Week 11 , the Browns went 5–50 in the 55 games between that point and the end of this season .
On December 7 , Brown was relieved of his duties as executive vice president .
John Dorsey , formerly of the Kansas City Chiefs , was hired as general manager the same day .
To further add to these failures , offensive tackle Joe Thomas missed the Pro Bowl for the first time in his career , as he tore his left triceps on October 22 , ending his season .
Before his injury , Thomas had not missed a single snap since joining the league in 2007 , a total of 10,363 plays .
He then decided to retire on March 14 , 2018 following the season .
The season saw the Browns play in London for the first time in franchise history , where they lost to the Minnesota Vikings 33–16 on October 29 .
