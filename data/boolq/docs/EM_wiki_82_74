THE PACIFIC ( MINISERIES )
The Pacific is a 2010 American television series produced by HBO , Playtone , and DreamWorks that premiered in the United States on March 14 , 2010 .
The series is a companion piece to the 2001 miniseries Band of Brothers and focuses on the United States Marine Corps ' actions in the Pacific Theater of Operations within the wider Pacific War .
Whereas Band of Brothers followed the men of Easy Company of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment through the European Theater , The Pacific centers on the experiences of three Marines ( Robert Leckie , Eugene Sledge , and John Basilone ) who were all in different regiments ( 1st , 5th , and 7th , respectively ) of the 1st Marine Division .
The Pacific was spearheaded by Bruce C. McKenna ( co - executive producer ) , one of the main writers on Band of Brothers .
Hugh Ambrose , the son of Band of Brothers author Stephen Ambrose , served as a project consultant .
The Pacific miniseries features the 1st Marine Division 's battles in the Pacific , such as Guadalcanal , Cape Gloucester , Peleliu , and Okinawa , as well as Basilone 's involvement in the Battle of Iwo Jima .
It is based primarily on the memoirs of two U.S. Marines : With the Old Breed : At Peleliu and Okinawa by Eugene Sledge and Helmet for My Pillow by Robert Leckie .
It also draws on Sledge 's memoir China Marine and Red Blood , Black Sand , the memoir of Chuck Tatum , a Marine who fought alongside Basilone on Iwo Jima .

The Pacific was produced by Steven Spielberg , Tom Hanks , and Gary Goetzman in association with HBO Miniseries , Playtone , DreamWorks , Seven Network and Sky Movies .
Seven and Sky both invested in the project for the right to broadcast it in Australia and the United Kingdom respectively .
Nine Network has previously broadcast the HBO productions of Band of Brothers .
Nine had a broadcast deal with HBO 's parent Warner Bros. , but then HBO started to distribute its own productions separately .
In April 2007 , the producers set up a production office in Melbourne and began casting .

According to The Sydney Morning Herald the series cost $ 270 million , with an estimated A$ 134 million of that spent in Australia .
The Australian newspaper Herald Sun estimates that it brought 4,000 jobs and generated A$ 180 million for the Australian economy .
Filming of the miniseries in Australia started on August 10 , 2007 , and finished in late May 2008 .
From August until November 2007 filming took place at locations in and around Port Douglas , Queensland including Mossman , Queensland ; Drumsara Plantation , Mowbray National Park and beaches at Rocky Point , Queensland .
Production then moved to rural Victoria , in the You Yangs near Lara ( from November – December 2007 ) , then at a sand quarry on Sandy Creek Road near Geelong , Victoria until February 2008 .
Melbourne city locations were used in late 2007 and through 2008 including Central City Studios at Melbourne Docklands ( March 2008 ) ; Flinders Street ( between Swanston and Elizabeth streets , 1–4 February 2008 ) ; the intersection of Swanston and Flinders streets ( February 2008 ) ; Flinders Street Station ( 2–3 February 2008 ) .

The series ' score was written by Hans Zimmer , Geoff Zanelli and Blake Neely and was released on March 9 , 2010 .
Historian Hugh Ambrose , son of Band of Brothers author Stephen E. Ambrose , wrote the official tie - in book to the miniseries , which follows the stories of two of the featured men from the miniseries , Basilone and Sledge , as well as stories of Sledge 's close friend Sidney Phillips and two men not featured in the series , marine officer Austin Shofner and U.S. Navy pilot Vernon Micheel .
The different cast provides a wider view of the Pacific theatre , allowing the book to include the fall of the Philippines , Midway , Philippine Sea and Luzon and expand the narrative to include depictions of life as experienced by prisoners of war , senior officers and the development of naval aviation .
It was published in the UK and the U.S. in March 2010 and Ambrose gave a webcast interview about the book at the Pritzker Military Library on April 15 , 2010 .

RECEPTION CRITICAL RECEPTION Section::::Reception .
Section::::Critical reception .
The Pacific was very well received by critics , receiving an average score of 87 out of 100 at review aggregator Metacritic .
Time magazine 's James Poniewozik named it one of the Top 10 TV Series of 2010 .
IGN reviewer Ramsey Isler gave the entire miniseries an 8.5 out of 10 ' Great ' score , saying " Although I do n't think The Pacific overtakes Band of Brothers in terms of technical execution and overall entertainment value , many of the comparisons will be moot as The Pacific is a different kind of series with different goals .
This series sought to look beyond the combat and it paints a full , vivid picture of the war and the people that fought it through focused , individual stories .
That 's a tall order for any series to fulfill , and although The Pacific does n't always come through with shining colors , it does make an admirable effort .
" IGN also reviewed each individual episode , with Episode 9 receiving a perfect 10 out of 10 score .

The Pacific won a Peabody Award in 2010 for " this series reminding us of the necessities — and the costs — of service . "
