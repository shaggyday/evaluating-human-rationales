HISTORY Section::::History .
Denver had long been a hotbed of Denver Bears / Zephyrs minor league baseball and many in the area desired a Major League team .
Following the Pittsburgh drug trials , an unsuccessful attempt was made to purchase the Pittsburgh Pirates and relocate them .
However , in 1991 , as part of Major League Baseball 's two - team expansion ( along with the Florida ( now Miami ) Marlins ) , an ownership group representing Denver led by John Antonucci and Michael I. Monus was granted a franchise ; they took the name " Rockies " due to Denver 's proximity to the Rocky Mountains , which is reflected in their logo .
Monus and Antonucci were forced to drop out in 1992 after Monus ' reputation was ruined by an accounting scandal .
Trucking magnate Jerry McMorris stepped in at the 11th hour to save the franchise , allowing the team to begin play in 1993 .
The Rockies shared Mile High Stadium ( which had originally been built for the Bears ) with the National Football League ( NFL ) 's Denver Broncos for their first two seasons while Coors Field was constructed .
It was completed for the 1995 Major League Baseball season .
In 1993 , they started play in the West division of the National League .
The Rockies were MLB 's first team based in the Mountain Time Zone .
have reached the Major League Baseball postseason five times , each time as the National League wild card team .
Twice ( 1995 and 2009 )
they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs .
In 2007 , the Rockies advanced to the World Series , only to be swept by the Boston Red Sox .
Like their expansion brethren , the Miami Marlins , they have never won a division title since their establishment ; they are also one of two current MLB teams that have never won their division .
The Rockies have played their home games at Coors Field since 1995 .
Their newest spring training home , Salt River Fields at Talking Stick in Scottsdale , Arizona , opened in March 2011 and is shared with the Arizona Diamondbacks .
