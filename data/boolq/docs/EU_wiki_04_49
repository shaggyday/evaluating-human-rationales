Along the way , Selene not only discovers a mutinous plot to destroy the vampire Elders , but also a shocking revelation about her father figure Elder , Viktor .
The vampires and Lycans are not supernatural creatures , but rather the product of a virus .
It is revealed in the film that Alexander Corvinus is the first of the vampire and lycan lines .
He was the only survivor of a plague that wiped out his village .
Somehow , his body was able to mutate the virus , mold it to his own benefit .
He had three sons , two of whom inherited their father 's immortality and were bitten , one by bat Markus , and one by wolf William , creating the vampire and werewolf lines .
Corvinus ' third son , who did not inherit immortality , also carried the Corvinus Strain as an exact duplicate of the original virus , hidden away in his genetic code and passed along to his human descendants through the centuries .
This , according to Singe , is the key to creating a hybrid .

CHARACTERS
VAMPIRES Section::::Characters .
Section::::Vampires .
Their transformation is not nearly as startling as their lycan counterparts .
When they transform , their eyes turn a shade of electric blue or bright gold , while their upper canine teeth lengthen to become pointed fangs .
At all times , the upper lateral incisors and upper canine teeth on all vampires are elongated and come to a sharp point .
Biologically immortal transgenics , the vampires of Underworld display most of the prominent superhuman physical prowess of other vampires commonly seen in popular culture , including superhuman strength , reflexes and speed , as well as an inhuman resistance to injury and accelerated healing .
These abilities are maintained by feeding on blood , which is a prominent factor in their healing capabilities in addition to being strengthened with age .
They do not possess any of the mystical weaknesses of mythological vampires ( crosses , holy water , garlic , wooden stakes , unable to cast a reflection in a mirror , etc . ) ; however , they are highly vulnerable to ultraviolet radiation ( including sunlight ) .
They can also be killed by a broken neck , blood loss , nightshade poisoning , dismemberment , decapitation , mutilation and other extreme physical trauma , especially if their head or heart is destroyed or removed .
The oldest vampires , the Elders , are , by consequence of their great ages , therefore the most powerful of their race , even stronger than Lycans in wolf form .
In the novelizations , the Vampire population as a whole is referred to as the " Vampire Nation " , consisting of covens ; traditionally , before the events of Evolution , the two main covens were the Old World Coven ( based in Hungary , in the environs of Budapest , with branch covens all - over the Euro - Asian continent ) , and the New World Coven ( based in the United States , in New York ) .
But since the assassinations of the Vampire Elder , Lady Amelia , and the Vampire Council , by the Lycans , the Vampire Elder , Lord Viktor 's death at Selene 's hand after learning the truth of her family 's deaths at his hands , the final Vampire Elder , Lord Marcus ' destruction of the main branch of the Old World Coven and its seat of power , Ördögház , and then his death at Selene 's hand to stop him and his rampaging brother , William ; the leadership and organization of the Vampire Nation was scattered and divided .
Though Vampire Councils still existed to rule the singular Covens , the Vampire Nation as a whole lacked central leadership , a weakness that made them noticeably different from the Lycans who gained a new singular leader each time after the death of their previous leaderships .
During the events of Underworld : Blood Wars , Selene 's Vampire ally David is revealed to be the secret son of the Elder Amelia and thus her rightful heir as both the leader of the Eastern Coven and as an Elder .
At the end of Blood Wars , three new Vampire Elders are chosen : Selene , David and the gifted Nordic Vampire Lena .
With the election of three new Vampire Elders , the central leadership of the Vampire Nation was restored after over a decade .
In the post - production of the film , the pallor of the vampires was achieved via D.I ..
As explained by Selene in the first Underworld film , a bite from both a Lycan and a vampire is lethal , but Michael 's bloodline allows him to survive and become a hybrid of both species .
Death Dealers are vampires that are specifically trained and tasked to kill Lycans .
SELENE Section::::Selene .
Selene appears in the films Underworld , , , and ; as well as in for a brief cameo .
Her lover is Michael Corvin , and together they now have a daughter , named Eve .
Selene is portrayed by Kate Beckinsale , and by Beckinsale 's daughter , Lily Mo Sheen , in Underworld : Evolution in flashback scenes as a child .
Selene was created by Kevin Grevioux , Len Wiseman , and Danny McBride .
According to Kevin Grevioux , Selene is based loosely on the Marvel Comics character of the same name .
After the events of Evolution , Selene is no longer merely a vampire , but a Vampire / Corvinus - Strain Hybrid , now more powerful and also immune to UV radiation .
At the end of , Selene is not only accepted once again by the vampire Covens , but also named a new vampire Elder alongside David and Lena .
VIKTOR Section::::Viktor .
Viktor was one of the three founding Vampire Elders of the Vampire Nation in the Underworld series .
He is portrayed by Bill Nighy .
Viktor was a Hungarian general and warlord born sometime in the 4th or early 5th century .
As he was nearing the end of his life , Markus Corvinus , the first true Vampire , offered immortality in exchange for Viktor 's military expertise and army in fighting against the Werewolves , spawn of Markus ' twin brother , William .
When Markus turned Viktor , the general became a vampire Elder .
The Death Dealers were created from Viktor 's army .
Viktor is a ruthless vampire Elder with his armies loyal to him , he overthrew the original vampire Markus and set himself up in Vampire myth as the first Vampire .
Viktor was the most powerful vampire ever to have lived mostly because his manipulation , experience , and cunning far surpassed the other Elders .
He is killed by Selene who cuts his head in half with his own sword .
In Blood Wars , Selene is hunted by the vampires for killing Viktor .
Selene 's only two allies are Thomas , who had no love for Viktor , and his son David whose mother was secretly Viktor 's fellow Elder Amelia .
Due to the threat of the new Lycan leader Marius , the Vampire Council agrees to pardon Selene for Viktor 's death if she will train their new Death Dealers but Semira , an old favorite of Viktor , frames Selene for murder to get revenge .
Following the deaths of Marius and Semira , the Vampires grudge against Selene for killing Viktor ends and she goes from pariah to one of the three new vampire Elders alongside Amelia 's son David and the Nordic Vampire Lena .
SONJA Section::::Sonja .
Sonja is the daughter of the vampire elder Viktor , introduced by flashback , in Underworld played Jázmin Dammak .
The character is heavily featured in , and is played by Rhona Mitra .
She fell in love with the lycan slave , Lucian , despite knowing her father would disapprove .
Without Viktor 's knowledge or blessing , she eventually married Lucian in secret , and became pregnant with his child .
For breaking the Covenant , Viktor executed her and her unborn child by exposure to sunlight , and her husband was forced to watch .
Viktor viewed the child as an abomination and was acting to protect the vampire line 's purity , although Sonja 's death haunted him for the rest of his life .
His guilt over this led him to spare Selene , who bore an uncanny resemblance to Sonja , from the slaughter of the rest of her family .
Sonja wore a pendant , which was given to her by her father .
After her death , Lucian took that pendant as a keepsake of his beloved wife .
This pendant proved to be vitally important to the events that unfolded in .
Her death started the war between Vampires and Lycans that lasted for centuries afterward .
MARKUS CORVINUS Section::::Markus Corvinus .
Markus Corvinus was the first vampire and one of the three founding Vampire Elders of the Vampire Nation in the Underworld series .
He is portrayed by Tony Curran .
Markus also appears in the novelization of the sequel .
Born sometime in the 5th century ; Markus was one of three sons of Helena and Alexander Corvinus , the first immortal .
Markus was also the twin brother of William Corvinus ; and they each inherited the immortality strain in its active form from their father .
Together , Markus and William both shared a bond as twins that Alexander never truly saw .
Markus was later bitten by a bat , thus making him the progenitor of what would become the Vampire species .
His twin , William , was bitten by a wolf and went on to ravage the countryside of Hungary , infecting the populace with his highly infectious lycanthropy virus .
In order to combat the growing werewolf threat Markus approached Viktor , a dying warlord , to utilize his military genius and army ( who became the Death Dealers ) in exchange for immortality .
Viktor accepted and became one of the Vampire Elders .
After being revived by the blood of the Lycan Singe , Markus awakens as a Hybrid and goes on a rampage to rescue William and turn him into a Hybrid too .
He kills his own father , and apparently his distant relative Michael Corvin , but is defeated and killed by an enhanced Selene in a final fight when she stabs him through the head with one of his own wing talons and knocks him into spinning helicopter blades , dismembering him .
In Blood Wars , while Selene is wanted for killing the Vampire Elder Viktor , no mention is ever made of her being wanted dead for killing Markus .
This suggests that his rogue actions became well - enough known for Selene to be pardoned for his death .
AMELIA
Section::::Amelia .
Amelia is one of the three founding Vampire Elders of the Vampire Nation in the Underworld series .
She appears briefly in Underworld and in a flashback sequence in , and appears in archive footage and as a painting in .
She is portrayed by Zita Görög and Sveta Driga .
Amelia was bitten and turned into a vampire , most likely by the first vampire , Markus himself , sometime 1500-years prior to the events of the first Underworld installment , according to the first novelization ( " Although nearly fifteen centuries old , the Lady Amelia still had all the youthful beauty and haughty carriage of an international supermodel " ) , and , as such , Amelia was the youngest of all three Elders , as well as the only female .
She was elevated to the rank of an Elder both in order to help control the chaos created by Markus 's brother William ( the first werewolf ; William was unable to return to human form after his transformation and his bite caused even the dead to turn to werewolves ) , and to perform the role of a tie - breaker between her fellow Elders , Markus and Viktor , if there was ever a deadlock in the ruling of the coven ; her original background prior to her Vampirism is yet unrevealed .
In 1202 AD .
Amelia sided with Viktor ( who also sought to undermine Markus ' authority , something he could not do without her help ) , supporting him in locking - up William within a coffin - like prison , in a remote place where Markus could not find him ( which turns Marcus against her too ) , as William was just too dangerous to be allowed to roam free .
The capture of William would not have happened without Amelia 's help .
Ultimately , Amelia did not keep control during her last reign , spending the majority of her reign amongst the New World Coven , which only allowed Viktor 's regent , Kraven , to conspire with Lucian , and Lucian to work deals with Tanis for weapons to kill Vampires ; She - herself was killed and " bled dry " by Lycans led by Raze during a planned attack , with Soren 's help , on her train .
In Blood Wars , Amelia was illustrated as having been something of a ' coven builder ' , founding or - else supporting the founding of a number of covens .
It is also later revealed that Amelia and a high - ranking vampire Thomas ( later the leader of the Western Coven following the events of the Purge ) had fallen in love , having fought 1st generation Werewolves alongside one - another , and , at some point , they had entered into a secret , private relationship ; some point into their centuries - long love , in the late 20th century , Amelia discovered she had become pregnant , and she and Thomas made plans to keep her pregnancy a secret ; before her pregnancy can start to show , Amelia announces her intention to visit old friends in the Var Dohr coven in Scandinavia , and appoints Thomas as her sole escort .
They both stayed with the Var Dohr coven for the duration of her pregnancy , culminating with the safe delivery of their pureborn son , David .
By this point , it would seem , Amelia 's prolonged absence from the Vampire Nation at large had aroused at least some suspicion as to why she was absent , and Semira was dispatched to investigate ; but by this time , however , David having been born and Amelia having recovered from the birth , Thomas and Amelia had left with their son and gone their separate ways ; to keep - up the appearances , Thomas put it out that he 'd had a low - born vampiress for a consort , who had just died in childbirth , and Amelia returned to the New World coven with no - one the wiser to the truth ; it would seem that Amelia , despite siding with Viktor against Marcus over William 's sentence , did n't completely trust him , keeping the existence of her son a secret .
During the main events of , Selene 's ally David learns that he is Amelia 's secret son and thus her heir as the new leader of the Eastern Coven .
Using some of Amelia 's blood she had left behind in case anything happened to her beforehand , David is able to prove his claim as Amelia 's rightful heir .
David thus becomes the new leader of the Eastern Coven and one of the three new Vampire Elders alongside Selene and the Nordic vampire Lena .
In the 3rd installment of the Underworld franchise , though Amelia makes no physical appearance in the story , there was an unspoken allusion that Viktor was plotting to get rid of her and replace her with his daughter , Sonja : Viktor kept saying " When you are an Elder " to Sonja rather than If , but never alludes to a future when he would be gone , and touting the bonds of family and blood being stronger than anything else ; as he sought to further increase and reinforce his own power base within the Vampire Nation , and believing Marcus ' lie about how his death would mean the immediate deaths of all Vampires , and that , as his own flesh and blood ( and having been planning - out her whole life for her ) , Sonja would be a more loyal ally
then Amelia , if Amelia should ever side with Marcus against him ( as Amelia had with Viktor against Marcus over William 's sentence ) , Viktor , paranoid and ambitious as ever , likely sought to replace Amelia with his daughter , Sonja , only to sentence Sonja to death for her affair and pregnancy with Lucian , abandoning this plan .
Whether Amelia ever suspected anything about this is unknown , but it would give credence to Amelia 's later efforts in keeping the existence and birth of her son from Viktor and his followers ( and , indeed , the Vampire Nation at large ) .
In the non - canon novel , Blood Enemy , Amelia , though making no physical appearance in the story , is described has having a habit similar to real - life historical Sanguinarian figure , Elizabeth Báthory the " Blood Countess " , of often indulging in baths of blood , believing it to enhance her beauty ( " The aroma of so much fresh blood was intoxicating .
Sonja tried to imagine what it would be like to bathe in such a tub ; her skin tingled beneath her gown .
It was said that Amelia herself sometimes indulged in such luxurious ablutions in order to enhance her beauty " , Blood Enemy novelization , chapter 8) .
ERIKA Section::::Erika .
Erika is portrayed by Sophia Myles .
She is a character in the Underworld film series as well as in the novelization of the film .
She is a vampire seductress , a social - climbing courtier in Viktor 's mansion , obsessed with rising through the ranks of the vampire aristocracy .
She is a high ranking maid who most recently began seeking the attentions of Kraven .
KRAVEN
Section::::Kraven .
Kraven is portrayed by actor Shane Brolly .
The name " Kraven " is a derivation of the English word " " , meaning " coward " , a reference to Kraven 's spineless nature .
Kraven has a vainglorious personality and a highly inflated - but - extremely - fragile narcissistic ego .
Kraven is a long - time suitor of Selene , a Death Dealer .
Kraven fancies himself in a relationship with Selene , even though she spurns him at every turn .
Yet , Kraven was so obsessed with Selene that the more she refused him , the more he wanted her .
When it becomes evident that Selene has fallen in love with Michael Corvin , Kraven becomes insanely jealous and highly irrational , demanding Michael Corvin 's head , and even shoots Michael multiple times with silver nitrate bullets , nearly killing him .
However , Selene revived Michael in the nick of time by biting him .
In his quest for power , Kraven had entered into a secret alliance with Lucian in - order to overthrow the Elders , helping to set up an ambush for the Lady Amelia .
After Lady Amelia 's death , and with Lucian and Viktor dead , Kraven goes after a slumbering Markus and tries to murder him in his sleep .
But , Markus surprisingly wakes as a Hybrid and massacres Kraven 's men .
Markus then bites Kraven and obtains his Blood memories .
Although , Markus stops before Kraven dies of blood loss , he turns down Kraven 's offer to ' assist ' him , seeing Kraven as untrustworthy .
Immediately after that , Markus kills Kraven by beheading him .
ANDREAS TANIS
Section::::Andreas Tanis .
Andreas Tanis is a character in the 2006 movie Underworld : Evolution and in the 2009 movie Underworld : Rise of the Lycans .
He is portrayed by Steven Mackintosh .
Tanis is a vampire of considerable age ( estimated at over 1000-years - old at the time of his death ) , he was at one point the official scribe and Historian of the Old World Coven .
An ambitious man , Tanis knew things about other vampires and kept the things he knew secret until it was of use for him .
Coveting a rise in status to a member of the Vampire Council , Tanis enters into a covert alliance with Sonja and Lucian , aiding them in exchange for his silence and Sonja 's seat on the Council ; his part in Sonja 's and Lucian 's plan remained a secret after Sonja 's execution , and later after Lucian 's faked death .
However , over 300 years prior to the events that occurred in the first and , the Vampire Elder , Lord Viktor , in his bid to rewrite history , turns on Tanis and orders his banishment , citing that Tanis had been recording " malicious lies " .
The order of banishment was carried out by Selene , who escorted him to an abandoned monastery on Viktor 's orders .
Over three hundred years later , Selene would learn the truth about Viktor and realize that what Tanis had recorded years earlier was , in fact , true .
Tanis is later killed by Markus after being drained of blood .
SOREN Section::::Soren .
Soren , having a surprising lack of personal ambition for a vampire , was Kraven 's janissary , and , being two of a kind , he was the rival / vampire counterpart of Raze before their deaths .
He is played by Scott McElroy .
Soren appears predominantly in the first film installment of Underworld , but is also referenced in the novelization of the sequel and also appearing in the comic book prequel , Not much is revealed about Soren 's past ; rumors surrounding him say that he is almost as old as Viktor himself ( and was probably bitten by the Vampire Elder ) , Soren was originally Viktor 's bodyguard , a position he may have held since before either were vampires .
Later , he served as the head torturer in Viktor 's employ .
He proved to be very skilled in taming Lycan slaves with silver - edged whips , and even used them on Lucian at Viktor 's request prior to Sonja 's execution .
In the non - canon novel , Underworld : Blood Enemy , Soren lost his position in Viktor 's good graces after he left Viktor 's daughter Sonja , whom he was charged to protect , alone during an ambush by mortals who were hateful of vampires .
He also remained ignorant of the fact that Sonja was in love with the Lycan Lucian until he was informed by a Lycan woman who had been obsessed with Lucian and resented him falling for Sonja .
Soren informed Viktor , who then executed his daughter .
Viktor blamed Soren for not protecting her .
Soren is one of the vampires involved in Viktor 's assault on the Lycan base in the first film , and ultimately faces Raze in single combat .
Soren initially holds the Lycan off , but after Raze shifts into full Lycan form , he tackles Soren and apparently kills him , since Soren is not seen afterward and Raze is .
DAVID Section::::David .
David is a character from the 2012 movie Underworld : Awakening and Underworld : Blood Wars .
He is portrayed by Theo James .
He is the son of Thomas , leader of the Western Coven and Amelia , the Vampire Elder .
Although never trained as a Death Dealer , and in contrast with his father , Thomas , David is not a coward and would fight when situations demanded it .
Fascinated by Selene 's past as a Death Dealer , he brought her back to the vampire coven with her hybrid daughter , Eve , hoping she would teach some of the members so that they could become what she used to be , as there are not any left within the coven .
David died after a raid by Lycans led by Quint Lane , but was revived by Selene using her Vampire - Corvinus Strain Hybrid blood , making him into a Vampire - Corvinus Strain Hybrid too .
During the final assault on Antigen , David , now with similar abilities to Selene including sunlight immunity , arrives to help unexpectedly .
Armed with a shotgun and two blades , David distracts Jacob Lane long enough for Eve to break free and fight back .
As more Lycan guards arrive , David turns his focus to them and single - handedly kills around a dozen Lycans .
After the battle , David joins Selene and Eve in searching for Michael Corvin who has escaped .
In Underworld : Blood Wars , David attempts to get Selene to return to aid the Vampire Covens against the new Lycan leader , Marius .
His resurrection has become something of a legend amongst the Vampires as he is the first Vampire to have ever been brought back from the dead .
After Semira betrays them , David and his father rescued Selene , but Thomas is killed after telling David to take Selene to the Nordic Coven .
David is able to use his sunlight immunity to escape Semira 's clutches and learns from the Nordic Coven that he is the son of the Vampire Elder Amelia and thus her rightful heir .
During the Lycan attack on the Nordic Coven , David helps defend it and is devastated by Selene 's apparent death .
David then returns to the Eastern Coven and interrupts a coup attempt by Semira by presenting himself as the heir of Amelia with some of her blood to prove it .
The Death Dealers and Vampire Council side with David and he leads a futile defense against a massive Lycan attack before a revived and enhanced Selene arrives with the Nordic Coven to help .
David and Semira , who has become a Vampire - Corvinus Strain Hybrid herself by drinking Selene 's blood , fight ending with David raising the shutters keeping out the sunlight .
David is able to use Semira 's distraction over her new sunlight immunity to kill her and after discovering that Selene has killed Marius , cuts off Marius ' head and uses it to get the Lycans to retreat .
Following the battle , David is made one of the new Vampire Elders alongside Selene and Nordic Vampire Lena .
THOMAS Section::::Thomas .
Thomas is one of the surviving Vampire Elders in and the father of David .
According to David , his father was once a vampire who had " defended [ his coven ] with fire and steel , rather than hollow words " , and that Selene reminds Thomas of the way he once was .
He does not trust Selene , and openly discriminates against her daughter , Eve , who is a Hybrid .
In contrast with his son , Thomas is a coward and ordered the coven to flee rather than fight , leaving David as de facto leader because of his demonstration of courage and intelligence , despite Thomas ' status now as a coven Elder .
His arrogance made him fail to realize the necessity of Selene 's presence or what she has become , until she used her blood to resurrect David after he died from the critical injuries he received from Lycans .
In , Thomas is approached by Semira to petition the Vampire Council to grant Selene clemency in exchange for her help in training their Death Dealers .
Thomas is successful , but Semira later frames Selene for murder and kidnaps her .
Thomas helps David rescue Selene and orders his son to take Selene to the Nordic Coven .
Thomas then battles both Semira and Varga before Semira kills him with a stab to the back of his head while he 's distracted .
Upon arrival at the Nordic Coven , David learns that Thomas once had a relationship with the Vampire Elder Amelia and he is their son as proven by blood memories left behind for him by Amelia .
He is portrayed by Charles Dance .

With the threat of the Lycan leader Marius and his army , Cassius and the Council are petitioned by the Vampire Thomas to offer Selene a pardon in exchange for her help in training their Death Dealer recruits .
Due to his hatred and mistrust for Selene , Cassius agrees only reluctantly and places Semira in charge of keeping an eye on Selene .
After Selene supposedly kills the recruits and Thomas , Cassius takes it as a sign that he was right and orders Selene 's death once more .
When Semira attempts to get the Council to take the fight to the Lycans , Cassius refuses , leading Semira to attempt a coup .
The coup is foiled by David who arrives with proof that he is the son of the Vampire Elder Amelia , making him the rightful leader of the Eastern Coven , causing Cassius , the Council and the Death Dealers to defer to his authority .
Cassius fights in the final battle with Marius ' army and at one point engages a transformed Lycan in hand - to - hand combat , killing it .
The battle ends when Selene kills Marius and the Lycans retreat .
In the aftermath , Cassius presents Selene with a goblet of blood as a sign of conceding power to her and forgiveness for her past transgressions .

Selene is rescued by David and Thomas , the latter of whom Semira murders , but Semira is able to get some of Selene 's blood and learns of Selene and David 's ability to walk in sunlight .
Semira later sends Alexia to the Nordic Coven , knowing she is really the lover of the new Lycan leader Marius and kills her upon her return .
Using Selene 's blood , Semira is able to turn herself into a Vampire - Corvinus Strain Hybrid like Selene and David and attempts to overthrow the Vampire Council .
However , David returns and reveals himself to be the son of the Vampire Elder Amelia and thus her rightful heir and true leader of the Eastern Coven .
At this revelation , Semira 's own Death Dealers turn on her , including her lover Varga
and she is arrested .
Semira manages to escape when the Lycans attack the Coven and battles David , being an even match for him with her new powers and proficient fighting skills .

LYCANS Section::::Lycans .
Werewolves in the Underworld films , like their vampire counterparts , are biologically immortal transgenics .
Lycans display a number of greatly enhanced physical attributes in either form ( superhuman strength , speed , reflexes , healing , etc . )
although the werewolf form is physically superior to both their human form and even to most vampires .
Lycans are highly allergic to silver , to the point of it being toxic and lethal to them , and it is even able to keep them weakened and unable to transform into their werewolf form .
They can also be killed or permanently damaged by extreme physical trauma as normal humans are , such as mutilation , a broken neck , or dismemberment , especially if their head or heart is destroyed or removed .
However , while first generation werewolves sired by William Corvinus are permanently transformed and feral , second generation werewolves , the Lycans , and those they convert , can become able to change between their human or werewolf forms at will and retain their personalities while transformed .
Their control over their transformation increases overtimes , to the point where they can partially transform to physically enhance themselves further , while age also gives them a limited tolerance to silver .
As explained by Selene in the first Underworld film though , a bite from both a Lycan and a vampire is lethal , but Michael 's heritage allows him to survive and become a hybrid of both species .
LUCIAN Section::::Lucian .
Lucian was the very first of the second - generation Lycans .

Lucian was once a Lycan servant to Viktor 's clan .
His relationship with Sonja began when they grew up and it was eventually revealed that Sonja was pregnant with his child , making their child a Lycan - Vampire hybrid ; but Sonja was executed , preventing the birth of the child .
He starts a war with Viktor as a result and fakes his own death with the help of Kraven , planning to become a Hybrid in order to kill Viktor .
His plan fails , but he holds Kraven off long enough for Selene to turn Michael Corvin into a Hybrid .
Selene also later kills Viktor to fulfill her own revenge against him .
Despite his plans to become a hybrid and to kill Viktor himself has failed , his will is seen through regardless with Michael 's turning and Viktor 's death .

Born sometime in the 5th century , William was one of three sons of Helena and Alexander Corvinus , the first immortal .
He , along with Markus , inherited the immortality strain in its active form from their father .
Markus and William both shared a bond as twins that Alexander never truly saw .
William was later bitten by a wolf , thus making him the progenitor of what would become the Lycan species ( his twin , Markus , was bitten by a bat ) .
Unlike most later Lycans , his fur was white .
William was unable to transform back into human form and had little more than ferocious savagery , nor is he ever shown in human form in any of the films .
His lycanthropy virus was much more potent than Markus ' vampire virus , even allowing dead victims to transform .
William went on to ravage the countryside of Hungary , infecting the populace with his highly infectious lycanthropy virus .
In order to combat the growing lycan threat Markus approached Viktor , a dying warlord , to utilize his military genius and army ( who became the Death Dealers ) in exchange for immortality .
Later , William was successfully captured and contained by the combined forces of Markus , Amelia and Viktor and used by Viktor to keep Markus in line .

Alexander was a Hungarian warlord who lived in the early 5th century .
He ascended to power just in time to watch his village ravaged by an unknown plague .
Alexander was the only survivor of the plague .
His body had adapted to the virus , and through some unknown means consequently made him immortal .
Years later , with his wife Helena , he fathered three children , two of whom inherited the immortal strain in its active form : twin brothers Markus and William .
Markus was bitten by a bat and became the first vampire .
William was bitten by a wolf and became the first werewolf .
William became a savage beast that was unable to ever assume human form again , something Alexander attributed to his uncontrollable rage .
Only Alexander 's third son ( who inherited the immortal strain in its inactive form ) remained a mortal human .
Markus and his vampire army ( led by Viktor ) captured his brother William and locked him in a secret prison for over 800 years , the location of which was kept from Markus .
When Viktor ordered his vampire daughter executed for becoming pregnant by a Lycan , he inadvertently touched off a centuries long war between lycans and vampires .
Alexander chose to keep the war contained from ever spilling into the mortal realm .
He hired humans to clean up after the battles and to help conceal their existence from the normal human population .
Alexander states in that he believes he and his sons were oddities of nature , and that the world is not theirs to conquer but belongs to the humans .
Despite not displaying any powers of his own , he is referred to by Selene as the strongest of the immortals and the only one capable of killing his sons , indicating he does possess some abilities .
At the time of Underworld : Evolution , Alexander was operating under the alias of Lorenz Macaro , and ran his operation from the ship " Sancta Helena " .
He meets with Selene and Michael , who ask for his help to destroy Markus and William .

As Alexander lays dying , he calls Selene to him to drink some of his pure immortal blood .
The blood , he tells her , will make her " the future " and is her only hope of being strong enough to destroy the Corvinus brothers .
After Selene and Michael leave , Alexander detonates a case of explosives on his ship , obliterating it in the harbor , along with killing himself .
His blood enhances Selene 's powers , making her equal to the Hybrid Markus in strength and giving her an immunity to sunlight , ultimately allowing her to defeat him .

After her escape , Selene discovers Eve and learns that she is her daughter , realizing that she had been pregnant at the time of her capture , and given birth to Eve all during her unconscious state .

UnderworldSeleneMichael Corvin DEVELOPMENT Section::::Development .
In September 2003 , shortly after the release of Underworld , production companies Screen Gems and Lakeshore planned to release a prequel as the third film following Underworlds sequel , Underworld : Evolution .
Kate Beckinsale , who portrayed Selene in Underworld , expressed interest in reprising her role for the sequel and the prequel .
In December 2005 , Underworld : Evolution director Len Wiseman explained that the Underworld franchise was originally conceived as a trilogy .
Wiseman said : " We sort of mapped out an entire history and story ...
a massive collection of ideas and stories that we 're putting out at certain times .
" Wiseman anticipated creating a third installment for the franchise based on the audiences ' reception of Underworld : Evolution , which would be released the following month .
In a June 2006 interview , Wiseman said , " The third film is going to be a prequel .
It will be the origin story and we find out things we did n't know about Lucian ; he 'll have a much bigger part in it .
It will be about the creation [ of the races ] and what started the war .
It will be a period piece .
The movie will also focus for the first time through the Lycans ' point of view .
"
The director also shared , " In terms of the writing , a lot of the writing has been done .
We 've been developing Underworld 3 for a while .
I wo n't be directing Underworld : Rise of the Lycans ; I 'm just going to be producing and writing . "
When asked if Kate Beckinsale would reprise her role as Selene in the prequel , Wiseman said , " It will be in the time period before , but it will overlap into the creation of her as well .
We 're in the process of seeing how far we go with that . "
The following October , actor Michael Sheen , who portrays Lucian in the film series , expressed interest in being part of the prequel .
The Hollywood Reporter announced that the film would be written by Danny McBride and mark the directorial début of Patrick Tatopoulos , who designed the creature effects for all three Underworld films .
Len Wiseman would produce , and contribute to the writing of this film , but would not direct , nor would Kate Beckinsale reprise her lead role of Selene nor would Scott Speedman reprise his role of Michael .
In late September 2007 , Outlander scribes Dirk Blackman and Howard McCain were brought on board and delivered a draft on November 3 , mere days before the 2007 - 2008 Writers Guild of America strike .
Pre - production began shortly thereafter .
The prequel film was shot in Auckland , New Zealand and in Roxboro , North Carolina .
There is a brief pickup shot of Tenaya Lake in Yosemite National Park as well .
