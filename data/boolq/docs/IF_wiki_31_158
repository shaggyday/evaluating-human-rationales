SUMMARY Section::::Summary .
In 1781 , Ichabod Crane works for George Washington as a double agent .
Crane beheads a Horseman , who does n't die ; in desperation , Crane wins with a mutual blow .
However , Crane next awakes in 2013 Sleepy Hollow with Washington 's bible to guide him ; he meets Lt . Abigail Mills , and learns the Horseman is back .
Crane learns he and Abbie are the Witnesses and the Horseman is Death ; should he get his head back , or his master , Moloch , be released from Purgatory , the End of Days will occur .
Crane also learns his wife , Katrina , was a witch banished to Purgatory for saving him as his blunder linked his life with the Horseman 's .
Fighting off Moloch 's army of demons , Crane learns the Horseman of War is his own son Jeremy Crane / Henry Parish , who loathes him and Katrina for abandoning him ; he also learns " Headless " is his former friend Abraham Von Brunt .
They manage to defeat Moloch , but at the cost of releasing everything trapped in Purgatory , including demons looking for a replacement for Moloch .
Henry gets Katrina to side with him to awaken the descendants of their coven , but both are regretfully killed by Crane .
In the following months , Crane investigates all myths regarding the Witnesses , learning that Moloch was the first of the Seven Tribulations .
The second comes in the form of Pandora , and her master the Hidden One , an ancient Sumerian god .
As Moloch is dead ( and thus can not end the world ) , Crane gives the Horseman back his head , allowing him to destroy Pandora ; however , the head is sucked into her box , which is destroyed .
This battle cost Abigail her soul .
Learning that there will always be two Witnesses , Crane vows to find her replacement to face the last five Tribulations .
Relocating to Washington D.C. , Crane discovers the next Witness is a little girl named Molly ; Crane works with her mother Agent Diana Thomas of Homeland Security to combat supernatural threats until Molly is old enough to help .
Crane also allies with Agency 355 agents Jake Wells and Alex Norwood , taking command of the organization as Washington wished .
The third tribulation comes in the form of Malcolm Dreyfuss , who sold his soul to build his business ; he seeks immortality to avoid dying .
After Dreyfuss becomes immortal , he decides to assemble the Four Horsemen to kill the president and takeover America .
A woman named Lara arrives from the future Dreyfuss wishes to create , revealing herself to be an alternate version of Molly ; as a result of being in her prime , Lara gains the Witness title from Molly , freeing her past self from the burden .
Crane is forced to make a deal with the devil for a piece of the philosophers ' stone to strip Dreyfuss of his immortality , sending Dreyfuss to hell .
