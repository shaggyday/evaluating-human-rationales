SONS OF ANARCHY
SEASON 1 Section::::Sons of Anarchy .
Section::::Season 1 .
Gemma Teller Morrow is the queen of Charming and the matriarch of the Sons of Anarchy .
A Machiavellian schemer and expert in psychological manipulation , Gemma is extremely protective of her son and grandson , and she longs for the day when Jax will , in her eyes , be ready to assume control over SAMCRO to ensure the organization 's survival for another generation .
She adores her husband , Clay , and does her best to make things work out his way .
Many of SAMCRO 's plans succeed because of Gemma 's quiet intervention ( e.g. , finding out who raped the little girl at the carnival in the episode " Fun Town , " and surveillance of L.O.A.N. in season two ) .
She generally has a hostile attitude toward all of Jax 's female friends and partners , including his ex - wife Wendy ; his on - again , off - again girlfriend Tara
( although Gemma later takes Tara under her wing ) ; and the club " groupies " with whom he occasionally has sex .
Her tough , but relatively classy , image includes hair highlights and a tattoo on her breast .
Nord boss Ernest Darby has indicated that he had a prior romantic interest in her .
She claims to be part Jewish " on the angry Russian side . "
SEASON 2
Section::::Season 2 .
Early in season Gemma is raped by Sons of Anarchy rival AJ Weston and two other unknown men wearing white masks .
During the assault , Gemma is told to tell Clay that it will happen again if he does not end his dealings with minorities .
Later , Gemma realizes Weston is one of her rapists , when she recognizes his tattoos .
When her friend Unser finds her at the rape scene , Gemma demands that he not tell Clay or Jax about the rape so as not to play into AJ Weston and Ethan Zobelle 's plans to get Clay and/or Jax to do something rash .
Unser complies and further covers up the source of Gemma 's injuries by crashing her car into a road divider and taking her to the hospital .
The only other person whom Gemma confides in about the rape is Tara Knowles , Jax 's girlfriend .
Unser later realizes that Chief Deputy Hale is starting to become more involved with Zobelle and his people and tells Hale about Gemma 's assault .
This causes Hale to re - evaluate his dealing with Zobelle .
The rape leaves Gemma with significant and visible emotional trauma , which causes problems in her marriage with Clay .
She also feels somewhat paranoid that AJ might try to attack her again .
Her paranoia is further compounded when someone from L.O.A.N. mails one of the rapists ' white masks to her .
When Gemma learns of Jax 's plans to become a Nomad , she tells him that she knows about the book her first husband , Jax 's father John Teller , had written .
She tells Jax she believes John 's death may not have been an accident , but rather a suicide .
After asking Jax to reconsider his decision , she implores him to read a certain page in John 's book , hoping it will give him guidance and perhaps change his mind .
The book fails to make Jax decide to stay and when the vote needed to allow him to leave is taken , it passes .
Upon learning that Jax still plans to become a Nomad , Gemma calls together her son , Tara , and husband Clay at her home and reveals , fairly graphically , the details of her assault and gang rape .
As a result , Jax picks up the jacket patches he had removed from his vest after the vote , which indicates that Jax has decided to stay with SAMCRO .
The following morning , feeling unwanted by Clay , Gemma comes on to an emotionally wrecked Tig , who reciprocates her advances , but stops when he sees a picture of Jax and Thomas at the beach as children .
Later , Tig is guilt - ridden and proceeds to confess to Opie about Donna 's murder .
Then , outside the church where Unser 's support group meets , Gemma is approached by the priest who runs the support group ; he offers her advice to serve others in order to deal with her own self - loathing .
Back at the garage , she runs into Chibs , who is distraught about his dealings with ATF agent Stahl .
She comforts him and advises him to come clean with the club .
After the club meeting , Tig tells Clay , at the end of the day , that Gemma thinks he does not want her anymore ; Clay proceeds to the office and shows that he still wants Gemma .
When the club goes on lock - down , Gemma looks after other families .
She tells Tara she ( Tara ) does not have to take crap from anyone , because she is the old lady of the Vice President .
Gemma has been teaching Tara , because she will one day be the queen of the club .
Inspired by Gemma , Tara stands up to her supervisor at the hospital , assaulting her at one point when she calls Gemma a whore .
In the second - season finale , Gemma happens to come across Polly Zobelle .
Wanting to get revenge and also do her part for SAMCRO , she follows Polly to Edmond Hayes ' house .
She sends Tara home and sneaks onto the property , where she finds a distraught Polly brandishing a gun .
Polly attempts to shoot , so Gemma kills her in self - defense .
She then discovers Edmond Hayes ' body and ATF Agent Stahl , saying that both of them had a bloody day .
Stahl offers to let her leave , but not before tossing her sidearm to Gemma , who catches it .
Gemma instantly realizes Stahl 's trick to get her fingerprints on the murder weapon , and flees .
At a bus stop payphone , she calls Police Chief Wayne Unser for help .
She is last seen fleeing Charming with Unser with no idea where to go .

Section::::Season 3 .
Gemma is still on the run at the beginning of Season 3 .
Tig is keeping her at a motel until Clay and SAMCRO can figure out a way to clear her name .

While at the motel , Gemma reads her mother 's obituary in a newspaper , which disturbs her .

However , upon returning home , Gemma discovers that Abel had been kidnapped .
This aggravates her heart condition , and she ends up in the hospital .
Gemma had made a deal to turn herself in to Stahl upon her return to Charming , in exchange for not receiving the death penalty for the murders of Edmund Hayes and Polly Zoebelle .
However , Stahl reneges on the deal , informing Gemma that because she did not turn herself in at the agreed - upon time ( because she was in the hospital )
, Gemma has violated the terms of the deal .
Later , Jax secretly works out a deal with Stahl , wherein he will give Stahl information on the IRA and get her back in the good graces of the ATF , in exchange for help with his mother .
( Stahl had been demoted and taken off the IRA case following the events at the end of season 2 . )
Stahl then supplies Jax with a statement for Gemma to give to the ATF , in which Gemma states the real events of the Hayes and Zoebelle shooting , except that Gemma fingered another ATF agent for the Edmund Hayes shooting .

The next day Gemma , Jax , and Opie go to the orphanage to get Abel .
When they get there , they are under orders of Father Ashby , who tries to prevent them from taking Abel home by lying about knowing where Abel is .
Gemma sees right through this , takes the baby hostage , and threatens to kill Ashby .
When the Irish finally tell where Abel is , Gemma gives the baby back , and Jax goes to find him .

After a deal is made between Jimmy and the True IRA , Abel returns home with his true family .
Once back in Charming , the club is trying to find Tara , and Gemma is struggling with the deal Jax made with Stahl .
Gemma knows it does not matter how much the rest of the club loves him ; if they find out he is ratting , they will kill him without hesitation .
Jax is still confident that nothing will go wrong and promises her that everything and everyone will be all right .
Gemma , still afraid , decides to take Stahl at gunpoint and force to kill the deal , warning that if Stahl does n't end the deal she will turn herself in and tell where her previous statement really came from .
She later greets Tara and hugs her for her safe return from Salazar .
In the season 3 finale , Gemma is still worried about the deal Jax made with Stahl .

Gemma warns Stahl that someone will get hurt .
When Clay comes to see Gemma in jail , she tells him they ca n't look at Jax the same way they saw John Teller , because club has been in desperate times .
At the end , she sees Jax arrive with Stahl and watches with sadness as Stahl sets up Jax to die at the hands of his own club , by exposing the deal they made .
But Gemma gets some relief after Jax sends her a letter explaining that he was never a rat ; the deal was a trap the entire club was in on , and the only reason they did n't tell her was to keep her from being an accessory if things went awry .
