LIST OF HIGHEST - SCORING NBA GAMES
In basketball , points are used to keep track of the score in a game .
Points can be accumulated by making field goals ( worth two points from within the three - point line or three points from beyond the three - point line ) or free throws ( worth one point ) .
The team that records the most points at the end of a game is declared the game 's winner .
If the game is still tied at the end of regulation play , additional overtime period(s ) are played in order to determine the winner .
Teams only averaged around 80 points per game in the years following the founding of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) in 1946 .
Before the introduction of the shot clock , teams often ran out the clock by passing the ball more frequently after they established a lead in a game .
If one team chose to stall , the other team ( especially if behind ) would often commit fouls to regain possession .
This resulted in very low - scoring games with many fouls , affecting attendance by making fans irritable .
Starting in the 1954–55 season , the NBA implemented a 24-second shot clock .
If the offensive team fails to hit the rim with the ball within the allotted time , they would lose possession .
This innovation resulted in much higher scoring games .
All of the highest - scoring games in the NBA have happened during the shot - clock era .
SUMMARY Section::::Summary .
The highest - scoring reguler season game is the triple - overtime game between the Detroit Pistons and the Denver Nuggets on December 13 , 1983 .
The two teams combined to score 370 points , with the Pistons defeating the Nuggets 186–184 .
An NBA - record four players scored over 40 points in the game , including the Nuggets ' Kiki Vandeweghe with a game - high 51 .
The two teams also set several other NBA records , including the most points scored by one team ( 186 points ) , the most points scored by a losing team ( 184 ) , the most field goals by two teams ( 142 ) , most field goals by one team ( 74 ) and most assists by two teams ( 93 ) .
The highest - scoring regular season game in regulation was between the Golden State Warriors and the Denver Nuggets on November 2 , 1990 .
In that game , Golden State defeated Denver 162–158 .
The Warriors ' Chris Mullin scored a game - high 38 points .
The Nuggets were coached by Doug Moe from 1980 to 1990 and Paul Westhead from 1990 to 1992 , both of whom employed a run and gun offensive strategy , which focuses on attempting a high number of field goals while also conceding a large number of points on defense .
In fact , Moe 's and Westhead 's Nuggets were participants in five of the ten highest - scoring regular season games in NBA history .
The Warriors were coached by Don Nelson from 1988 to 1995 and 2006 to 2010 .
He employed Nellie Ball , a style of run and gun that uses smaller , more athletic players to outrun opponents .
Another notable high scoring regular season game is a March 2 , 1962 game between the Philadelphia Warriors and the New York Knicks .
In that game , the Warriors ' Wilt Chamberlain scored an NBA - record 100 points .
The highest - scoring playoff game is the double - overtime game between the Portland Trail Blazers and the Phoenix Suns on May 11 , 1992 .
The two teams combined to score 304 points , with the Trail Blazers defeating the Suns 153–151 .
The Suns ' Kevin Johnson scored a game - high 35 points , with 12 other players also scoring in double figures .
The highest - scoring playoff game in regulation occurred when the San Antonio Spurs defeated the Denver Nuggets with a score of 152–133 for a combined score of 285 points on April 26 , 1983 .
In that game , the Spurs ' George Gervin scored a game - high 42 points .
Most of the highest - scoring games happened before the 1995–96 season , when the average scoring ( points per game ) per team was always in the 100s .
Until the emergence of ' small ball ' in 2013 , the average had dropped down to the 90s .
Only two post-1995 games make the top - ten lists of both the regular season and playoffs : a May 10 , 2003 game between the Dallas Mavericks and the Sacramento Kings and a December 7 , 2006 game between the Phoenix Suns and New Jersey Nets .
Both the Mavericks and the Suns were coached by Nelson and Mike D'Antoni respectively , both of whom also made use of the run and gun style .
