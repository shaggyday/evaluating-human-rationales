This Finals marked a rematch of the 2006 Finals , won by Miami in six games , after the Mavericks were up 2–0 .
It was also the first time since 2006 that neither the Los Angeles Lakers nor the San Antonio Spurs represented the Western Conference in the Finals and only the second time since , and also the thirteenth consecutive NBA Finals to feature a Western Conference Champion from either the states of California or Texas .

The Heat made only 28.6 percent of their shots during the first quarter , and this low scoring percentage early on left the Mavs with an 8-point lead early into the 3rd quarter .
The Heat changed course from this point on , outscoring the Mavs 22–10 and taking a 65–61 lead going into the 4th quarter .
Mavs power forward Dirk Nowitzki injured his finger within the last four minutes of the game , but remained in play , wearing a splint to support the torn tendon .
Despite having a below - average performance early in the game , Heat shooting guard Dwyane Wade and small forward LeBron James collaborated on both defensive and offensive ends of the court in the fourth quarter , leading the Heat to win Game 1 over the Mavs 92–84 .
GAME 2 Section::::Game 2 .
The Mavs ' 15-point comeback was the biggest in an NBA Finals game since the 24-point comeback the Celtics made against the Lakers in Game 4 of the 2008 NBA Finals .
Dirk Nowitzki hit a 3 with 26.7 seconds left to give the Mavericks a 93–90 lead .
However , Mario Chalmers tied it with a 3 of his own with 24.5 seconds left when Jason Terry left him wide open .
After Jason Kidd ran the clock down , Nowitzki then made a driving layup with his injured left hand with 3.6 seconds left .
The Heat had no timeouts left , and Dwyane Wade 's potential game - winning 3 hit the back rim at the buzzer as he fell to the ground in an attempt to draw a foul on Nowitzki .
The Mavs win broke the Heat 's 9-game home winning streak in the playoffs , costing them a chance to tie the 1996 Bulls ' mark of 10 straight .

With 39.6 seconds left in the 4th , LeBron James found Chris Bosh for a 20-foot baseline jumper ; Dirk Nowitzki had a chance to force OT , but missed a well - defended fadeaway jumper at the buzzer as the Heat handed Dallas another defeat to go up 2–1 in the series .
It was Miami 's 6th win in its last 7 NBA Finals games , 4 by 3 points or less .
GAME 4 Section::::Game 4 .

Unhappy with Terry for missing a defensive assignment and setting a poor cross - screen , Mavs coach Rick Carlisle pulled Terry from the game , telling him , " Refocus .
I 'm putting you right back in . "

This move ignited Dallas ' offense , leading them on a game - winning 15–3 run in which Terry scored or assisted on 11 points .
