CIVIL CALENDAR
The civil calendar is the calendar , or possibly one of several calendars , used within a country for civil , official or administrative purposes .
The civil calendar is almost always used for general purposes by people and private organizations .
The most widespread civil calendar and de facto international standard is the Gregorian calendar .
Although that calendar is associated with the Catholic Church and the papacy , it has been adopted , as a matter of convenience , by many secular and non - Christian countries although some countries use other calendars .
