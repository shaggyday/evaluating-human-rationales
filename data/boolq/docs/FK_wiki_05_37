LIST OF MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL SINGLE - GAME GRAND SLAM LEADERS
In baseball , a grand slam is a home run that is hit when all three bases are occupied by baserunners ( " bases loaded " ) , thereby scoring four runs — the most possible in one play .
Thirteen players have hit two grand slams in a single Major League Baseball ( MLB ) game to date , the most recent being Josh Willingham of the Washington Nationals on July 27 , 2009 .
No player has accomplished the feat more than once in his career and no player has ever hit more than two in a game .
Tony Lazzeri was the first player to hit two grand slams in a single game , doing so for the New York Yankees against the Philadelphia Athletics on May 24 , 1936 .
Every team which had a player hit
two grand slams won their milestone games .
These games have resulted in other single - game MLB records being set due to the extreme offensive performance .
Lazzeri , for example , proceeded to hit a third home run in the game and finished with a total of eleven runs batted in , an American League record .
Fernando Tatís became the only player to hit two grand slams in the same inning , when he attained the milestone , slugging two in the third inning for the St. Louis Cardinals on April 23 , 1999 .
In achieving the feat , he also set a new major league record with eight runs batted in in a single inning .
Tony Cloninger is the only pitcher to have accomplished the feat .
Bill Mueller hit his grand slams from both sides of the plate , while Jim Northrup hit his grand slams on consecutive pitches received in the fifth and sixth innings .
Nomar Garciaparra is the sole player to achieve the feat at home , doing so at Fenway Park for the Boston Red Sox .
Cloninger is the only player who never hit a grand slam before or after his milestone game , while Robin Ventura — with 18 grand slams — hit more than any other player in this group .
Frank Robinson is also a member of the 500 home run club .
Of the nine players eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame who have hit two grand slams in a game , two have been elected , one on the first ballot .
Players are eligible for the Hall of Fame if they have played in at least 10 MLB seasons , and have either been retired for five seasons or deceased for at least six months .
These requirements leave ineligible one player — Josh Willingham — who is living and has played in the past five seasons and one — Jim Tabor — who did not play in 10 seasons .
