FOCAL LENGTH
The focal length of an optical system is a measure of how strongly the system converges or diverges light .
For an optical system in air , it is the distance over which initially collimated ( parallel ) rays are brought to a focus .
A system with a shorter focal length has greater optical power than one with a long focal length ; that is , it bends the rays more sharply , bringing them to a focus in a shorter distance .
In most photography and all telescopy , where the subject is essentially infinitely far away , longer focal length ( lower optical power ) leads to higher magnification and a narrower angle of view ; conversely , shorter focal length or higher optical power is associated with lower magnification and a wider angle of view .
On the other hand , in applications such as microscopy in which magnification is achieved by bringing the object close to the lens , a shorter focal length ( higher optical power ) leads to higher magnification because the subject can be brought closer to the center of projection .
THIN LENS APPROXIMATION
Section::::Thin lens approximation .
For a thin lens in air , the focal length is the distance from the center of the lens to the principal foci ( or focal points ) of the lens .
For a converging lens ( for example a convex lens ) , the focal length is positive , and is the distance at which a beam of collimated light will be focused to a single spot .
For a diverging lens ( for example a concave lens ) , the focal length is negative , and is the distance to the point from which a collimated beam appears to be diverging after passing through the lens .
When a lens is used to form an image of some object , the distance from the object to the lens u , the distance from the lens to the image v , and the focal length f are related by
The focal length of a thin lens can be easily measured by using it to form an image of a distant light source on a screen .
The lens is moved until a sharp image is formed on the screen .
In this case is negligible , and the focal length is then given by GENERAL OPTICAL SYSTEMS Section::::General optical systems .
For a thick lens ( one which has a non - negligible thickness ) , or an imaging system consisting of several lenses or mirrors ( e.g. , a photographic lens or a telescope ) , the focal length is often called the effective focal length ( EFL ) , to distinguish it from other commonly used parameters :
* Front focal length ( FFL ) or front focal distance ( FFD ) ( s ) is the distance from the front focal point of the system ( F ) to the vertex of the first optical surface ( S ) .
*
Back focal length ( BFL ) or back focal distance ( BFD )
( s′ ) is the distance from the vertex of the last optical surface of the system ( S ) to the rear focal point
( F′ ) .
For an optical system in air , the effective focal length ( f and f′ ) gives the distance from the front and rear principal planes ( H and H′ ) to the corresponding focal points ( F and F′ ) .
If the surrounding medium is not air , then the distance is multiplied by the refractive index of the medium ( n is the refractive index of the substance from which the lens itself is made ; n is the refractive index of any medium in front of the lens ; n is that of any medium in back of it ) .
Some authors call these distances the front / rear focal lengths , distinguishing them from the front / rear focal distances , defined above .
In general , the focal length or EFL is the value that describes the ability of the optical system to focus light , and is the value used to calculate the magnification of the system .
The other parameters are used in determining where an image will be formed for a given object position .
For the case of a lens of thickness d in air ( ) , and surfaces with radii of curvature R and R , the effective focal length f is given by the Lensmaker 's equation : where n is the refractive index of the lens medium .
The quantity is also known as the optical power of the lens .
The corresponding front focal distance is : and the back focal distance :
In the sign convention used here , the value of R will be positive if the first lens surface is convex , and negative if it is concave .
The value of R is negative if the second surface is convex , and positive if concave .
Note that sign conventions vary between different authors , which results in different forms of these equations depending on the convention used .
For a spherically curved mirror in air , the magnitude of the focal length is equal to the radius of curvature of the mirror divided by two .
The focal length is positive for a concave mirror , and negative for a convex mirror .
In the sign convention used in optical design , a concave mirror has negative radius of curvature , so where R is the radius of curvature of the mirror 's surface .
See Radius of curvature ( optics ) for more information on the sign convention for radius of curvature used here .
IN PHOTOGRAPHY Section::::In photography .
Camera lens focal lengths are usually specified in millimetres ( mm ) , but some older lenses are marked in centimetres ( cm ) or inches .
Focal length ( f ) and field of view ( FOV ) of a lens are inversely proportional .
For a standard rectilinear lens , FOV = 2 arctan , where x is the diagonal of the film .
When a photographic lens is set to " infinity " , its rear nodal point is separated from the sensor or film , at the focal plane , by the lens 's focal length .
Objects far away from the camera then produce sharp images on the sensor or film , which is also at the image plane .
To render closer objects in sharp focus , the lens must be adjusted to increase the distance between the rear nodal point and the film , to put the film at the image plane .
The focal length ( f ) , the distance from the front nodal point to the object to photograph ( s ) , and the distance from the rear nodal point to the image plane ( s ) are then related by : As s is decreased , s must be increased .
For example , consider a normal lens for a 35 mm camera with a focal length of f = 50 mm .
To focus a distant object ( s ≈ ∞ ) , the rear nodal point of the lens must be located a distance s =
50 mm from the image plane .
To focus an object 1 m away ( s = 1,000 mm ) , the lens must be moved 2.6 mm farther away from the image plane , to s = 52.6 mm .
The focal length of a lens determines the magnification at which it images distant objects .
It is equal to the distance between the image plane and a pinhole that images distant objects the same size as the lens in question .
For rectilinear lenses ( that is , with no image distortion ) , the imaging of distant objects is well modelled as a pinhole camera model .
This model leads to the simple geometric model that photographers use for computing the angle of view of a camera ; in this case , the angle of view depends only on the ratio of focal length to film size .
In general , the angle of view depends also on the distortion .
A lens with a focal length about equal to the diagonal size of the film or sensor format is known as a normal lens ; its angle of view is similar to the angle subtended by a large - enough print viewed at a typical viewing distance of the print diagonal , which therefore yields a normal perspective when viewing the print ;
this angle of view is about 53 degrees diagonally .
For full - frame 35 mm - format cameras , the diagonal is 43 mm and a typical " normal " lens has a 50 mm focal length .
A lens with a focal length shorter than normal is often referred to as a wide - angle lens ( typically 35 mm and less , for 35 mm - format cameras ) , while a lens significantly longer than normal may be referred to as a telephoto lens ( typically 85 mm and more , for 35 mm - format cameras ) .
Technically , long focal length lenses are only " telephoto " if the focal length is longer than the physical length of the lens , but the term is often used to describe any long focal length lens .
Due to the popularity of the 35 mm standard , camera – lens combinations are often described in terms of their 35 mm - equivalent focal length , that is , the focal length of a lens that would have the same angle of view , or field of view , if used on a full - frame 35 mm camera .
Use of a 35 mm - equivalent focal length is particularly common with digital cameras , which often use sensors smaller than 35 mm film , and so require correspondingly shorter focal lengths to achieve a given angle of view , by a factor known as the crop factor .
