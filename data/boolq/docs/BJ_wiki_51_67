The team , which plays in the International League , is the Triple - A affiliate of the Chicago White Sox of the American League .
The Knights play at BB&T Ballpark located in Uptown Charlotte .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Professional baseball in Charlotte dates to 1892 , with the formation of the Charlotte Hornets .
The 1892 Hornets played in the South Atlantic League , but only lasted one season .
A new team , the Charlotte " Presbyterians " played in 1900 , but just a year later , a new " Charlotte Hornets " baseball team formed .
They were an independent team until 1935 , when they became the Class B Piedmont League affiliate of the Boston Red Sox during that year only .
Later in 1937 , the Washington Senators , now the Minnesota Twins , purchased the team .
The Hornets would remain affiliated with the Senators / Twins for 35 years .
In 1940 , Calvin Griffith , the son of Senators owner Clark Griffith and future owner of the Senators / Twins , built a 3,200-seat park in Charlotte 's Dilworth neighborhood , Calvin Griffith Park .
It would be the home of Charlotte baseball for the next half - century .
After several years on the lower rungs of the minor league totem pole , the Hornets joined the Class A South Atlantic League in 1954 .
They had previously been members of the South Atlantic League in the 1920s while they were still independent .
The South Atlantic League became a Double - A league in 1963 and renamed itself the Southern League in 1964 .
In 1972 , the Twins placed their Single - A affiliate in the Western Carolinas League as the Charlotte Twins .
After a lackluster season , however , they were moved to Orlando as the Orlando Twins .
The Hornets disbanded , now leaving the city with no professional baseball .
There was talk that Charlotte might get baseball again , but a new team to be called the " Charlotte Pines " never came to fruition .
Charlotte would n't see baseball again until 1976 , when wrestling promoter Jim Crockett , Jr. bought the Asheville Orioles , the Double - A affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles , and renamed them the Charlotte Orioles .
Griffith Park was fixed up , and in 1977 it was renamed Jim Crockett , Sr .
Memorial Park ( popularly known as Crockett Park ) .
The team , popularly known as the O 's , won Southern League titles in 1980 and 1984 .
Eventual major - league superstars Eddie Murray ( the O 's original first baseman in 1976 ) and Cal Ripken ( 1980 ) played for the O 's .
In March 1985 , Crockett Park ( mostly wood - framed ) was destroyed by a massive fire after a high school baseball game .
An investigation revealed that the fire was caused by arson .
The Crockett family built a 3,000-seat makeshift stadium immediately afterward , which served as the O 's home for two years .
However , unlike its predecessor , it was completely exposed to the elements , causing a steep decline in attendance .
In 1987 , George Shinn , founder of the NBA Charlotte Hornets , bought the team from the Crockett family and committed to building a permanent home for the team .
In 1988 , the team was renamed the Charlotte Knights out of a naming contest , and Crockett Park was renamed " Knights Park " .
The following season , 1989 , the organization 's 12-year affiliation with the Orioles ended when Shinn switched the team 's affiliation to the Chicago Cubs .
The team moved to Knights Castle , a temporary 8,000 seat stadium located on Deerfield Drive in Fort Mill , South Carolina near the construction site of their permanent home , Knights Stadium .
The stadium was built for the 1989 season and was demolished following the final game that year to make room for Knights Stadium .
In 1993 , Charlotte won an expansion team in the International League , which quickly secured an affiliation with the Cleveland Indians .
This expansion team took the Charlotte Knights name , as well as the heritage of the old Double - A team .
It was the first time a team from the Carolinas had played at the highest level of minor league baseball .
The former Double - A Knights of the Southern League relocated to Nashville , Tennessee and ultimately Mobile , Alabama to become the current Mobile Bay Bears .
The new Triple - A Knights , led by future major - league stars Jim Thome and Manny Ramírez , won the International League title in 1993 .
Much of the core of that team , including manager Charlie Manuel , played a role in the Indians ' World Series teams of 1995 and 1997 .
For the 1995–1998 seasons , the Knights were the Triple - A affiliate of the Florida Marlins .
Before the 1999 season , Shinn sold the Knights to North Carolina businessman Don Beaver , who negotiated a Triple - A affiliation agreement with the Chicago White Sox , a relationship that still continues today .
The Knights won another International League title in 1999 as the White Sox ' top affiliate .
Notable former Knights under the White Sox affiliation include pitcher Jon Garland and former third baseman Joe Crede , both of whom played on the White Sox ' World Series championship team in 2005 .
Later , Beaver and the White Sox extended their affiliation agreement , ensuring that professional baseball would remain in the Charlotte area for many years to come .
On October 8 , 2009
the Charlotte Knights and York County agreed in principle on a four - year lease for the team to play at Knights Stadium in Fort Mill .
The agreement was to add fan related upgrades to the facility .
In 2011 , the Charlotte City Council and Mecklenburg County Commission approved a land - swap agreement which opened the door for the construction of a new Triple - A - sized stadium in downtown Charlotte .
The $ 54-million BB&T Ballpark opened in time for the 2014 season .
It is located one block from Bank of America Stadium , home of the Carolina Panthers .
The team 's attendance had sagged since the start of the new millennium , and it was hoped that bringing the Knights back to the city would increase attendance .
To go along with the move , the Knights dropped the navy blue and dark green color scheme , as well as the old horse head and other logos they had been using for the past fourteen years , and adopted a new black - gold - silver palette , modeled on the color scheme of their parent team .
They also adopted a new logos that focused more on the " knight " rather than the " horse " .
They also adopted new pinstripe jerseys , a nod to the old Hornets .
In 2016 , pitcher Brad Goldberg was Charlotte 's lone 2016 mid - season International League
All Star , and finished the season with a 2.84 ERA and 10 saves ( a team high ) in 11 opportunities as the team 's closer .
