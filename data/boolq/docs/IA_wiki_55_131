DON'T
STARVE Do n't Starve is an open world survival video game developed by the Canadian indie company Klei Entertainment .
The game was initially released via Valve Corporation 's Steam software for Microsoft Windows , OS X , and Linux on April 23 , 2013 .
A PlayStation 4 port , renamed Do n't Starve : Giant Edition , became available the following year ( with PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3 versions released on September 2014 and June 2015 respectively , and an Xbox One version released in August 2015 ) .
Do n't Starve for iOS , renamed Do n't Starve : Pocket Edition was released on July 9 , 2015 .

Downloadable content titled Reign of Giants was released on April 30 , 2014 , and a multiplayer expansion called Do n't Starve Together became free for existing users on June 3 , 2015 .
A Nintendo Switch port came out on April 12 , 2018 .
The game follows a scientist named Wilson who finds himself in a dark , dreary world and must survive as long as possible .
To this end , the player must keep Wilson healthy , fed , and mentally stable as he avoids a variety of surreal and supernatural enemies that will try to kill and devour him .
The game 's Adventure mode adds depth to the sparse plot and pits Wilson against the game 's antagonist , Maxwell .
Do n't Starve was Klei 's first foray into the survival genre .
Conceived during the height of a game industry trend of dropping players into a world with few instructions and a goal of survival , the game was influenced by Minecraft , which spearheaded this trend , as well as by filmmaker Tim Burton .
The game received positive reviews from critics , commended for its original art style , music , and variety of ways for the player to die , although its high level of difficulty and implementation of permanent death were less warmly received .
GAMEPLAY
Section::::Gameplay .
Do n't Starve is an action - adventure game with a randomly generated open world and elements of survival and roguelike gameplay .
Combat is handled by pointing and clicking with the mouse , while other activities are controlled by the keyboard , or using the inbuilt gamepad support to play using a controller , giving it a console - like gameplay feel .
The goal is to survive as long as possible , and a count of the number of days the player has survived is shown onscreen .
The game keeps few records of player progress besides the total number of experience points and the playable characters unlocked .
Wilson is the default playable character , unlocked upon purchase of the game , but the next character , Willow , can be unlocked with 160 experience points .
Woodie , the last character unlockable with experience , requires the game 's limit of 1,600 .
The player earns 20 experience points each in - game day and receives them after dying .
As is common among roguelikes , death is permanent , barring the use of several rare or expensive items like the Meat Effigy , TouchStone , and Life - Giving Amulet .
The game relies on a day / night cycle that causes meaningful fluctuations in gameplay style .
During the day , the player spends most of their time exploring the world : gathering food , firewood , and other resources , discovering crafting recipes to combine available items , and avoiding enemies .
With nightfall comes dangerous monsters and an invisible menace , Charlie , who attacks the player when the screen is dark .
A player must have a light source or night vision to prevent Charlie from attacking .
Crafting from recipes allows the player to build shelter , weapons , and tools like axes .
Players can forage and farm plants as well as hunt animals for sustenance , with several characters having dietary perks or restrictions .
Food can spoil , however , so the player can not keep it for too long .
Eating spoiled food results in a loss of health , sanity , and an increase in hunger .
Each in - game day takes 8 minutes of real time .
Death can occur in a variety of ways .
The player has three gauges displayed on the game 's head - up display , which respectively track hunger , health , and sanity .
Hunger worsens by default , being replenished with food .
Sanity decreases during the dusk and night or as a result of specific unpleasant actions , such as robbing graves or fighting monsters ; it can be replenished through mentally stimulating activities , such as sleeping , picking flowers , and wearing fashionable clothing .
When hunger gets too low , it begins to chip away at health , which will eventually result in the player 's death .
A large variety of creatures can attack the player , including giant one - eyed birds , tree monsters , tentacles whose owners are not shown , and even small , weak frogs that will nonetheless try to accost the player and steal from them .
Additionally , at low enough sanity , figments of the character 's imagination become corporeal and able to attack the player .
Some creatures , such as pig - like creatures often found in tribes , begin as neutral to the player ( Excluding the Reign of Giants character Webber ) , but the player 's actions may lead them to be allies or hostile foes .
The bulk of the game is played in Sandbox Mode , but there is a second mode , Adventure , which the player can access by finding a landmark called Maxwell 's Door .
Adventure serves as the game 's campaign , consisting of five levels that pit the player against Maxwell , the antagonist of Do n't Starve .
The player loses all items and recipes upon entering , and can only pick four to keep upon completion of each chapter .
Death or the end of the five sections returns the player intact to Sandbox Mode .
PLOT CHARACTERS Section::::Plot .
Section::::Characters .
Wilson , a gentleman scientist , is the protagonist of Do n't Starve .
While Wilson has no special abilities beyond growth of " a magnificent beard " , which slows the speed of freezing in winter and accelerates overheating in summer , other playable characters do ; a few examples follow .
Willow , a firestarter , is immune to fire damage and will start spreadable fires on the ground when she has low sanity .
A girl named Wendy receives visits from her deceased twin sister Abigail when summoned .
The strongman , Wolfgang , has high health and significant offensive capabilities that grow better the more his hunger meter is full , but he starves faster and loses more sanity when near danger .
WX-78 is an android that nonetheless needs to eat , sleep , and stay mentally stimulated , but does not become ill from spoiled food , can increase its maximum health , hunger , and sanity with gears ( reset to the original maximum after dying and respawning ; the corpse leaves behind a portion of the used ones ) , and takes damage from rain .
WX-78 also attracts lightning , being made of conductible material , that makes it surrounded by a glow that gradually dies down as time passes , that refills health , and that lowers sanity .
The game 's antagonist is Maxwell .
Maxwell is described as a puppet master who is dapper and frail in stature .
He is part - demon and transforms incrementally as his anger at the player increases over the five chapters of Adventure .
He is the final unlockable character , obtained after completion of the story rather than with experience points .
The character version of Maxwell starts with a Dark Sword , Night Armor , Purple Gem , 4 Nightmare Fuel and the Codex Umbra , a book that when activated uses 2 nightmare fuel , depletes 15 health , lowers maximum sanity by 55 , and spawns a shadow clone of himself that aids him in battle , mining and wood chopping .
Shadow Puppets have 75 health and deal 40 damage with each attack .
When they die , they disappear and return Maxwell 's lost maximum of sanity .
A maximum of 3 puppets can be spawned at once , and each will disappear 2.5 days after it is spawned if it does n't die earlier .
STORY
Section::::Story .
The game opens with Maxwell snidely informing the player of their gaunt appearance and includes little further story .
The game 's setup is told further through its trailer : on a dark and stormy night , Wilson appears to be getting nowhere in a chemistry experiment until he is startled by his radio speaking to him .
It reveals that it has noticed his trouble and has secret knowledge of him .
When he eagerly agrees , a flurry of equations and diagrams encircle him and fill his head .
Using white rats , a typewriter , and his blood among other tools and materials , Wilson creates a giant machine .
The radio commends his work and tells him to pull the machine 's switch .
He hesitates , but at the radio 's insistence , he does so .
The machine rattles violently , and a pair of ghostly arms whisk him into a different world while an apparition of Maxwell cackles .
During the Adventure mode , at the start of each chapter , Maxwell appears and comments .
At first , he seems impressed at the player 's hardiness ; he then becomes irritated and urges the player to turn back .
He offers the player a truce but , upon its decline , becomes enraged .
At the end of Adventure mode , the player reaches an island called Maxwell 's Island with a hall belonging to Maxwell on it .
The player finds Maxwell trapped in a throne encircled by short stone pillars .
The player is at first unable to free him but finds a keyhole and a key nearby .
The player sets Maxwell free , but he turns into a skeleton and disintegrates as he stands up .
The ghostly arms from the trailer then grab the player and ensnare him in the throne .
An epilogue implies that the player will take on a villainous role similar to Maxwell 's using newfound powers given by the throne but will nonetheless be trapped forever .
DEVELOPMENT CONCEPTION AND DESIGN Section::::Development . Section::::Conception and design .
Do n't Starve was developed and published by indie studio Klei Entertainment .
The game began development as part of a 48-hour game jam in 2010 .
The team liked the idea but shelved it until two years later , when they had the time to flesh it out .
Full development commenced in 2012 , while Klei was nearing the end of the development process of Mark of the Ninja .
This was during the heat of an industry trend of creating games in which players are dropped into a world with few instructions and a goal of survival .
The torch of this movement was held by the 2011 sandbox game Minecraft .
Member Kevin Forbes stated in an interview that Minecraft was one of the team 's biggest influences , particularly its exploration elements .
However , as the game was conceived as a " weird experiment " , the team 's main goal was to innovate in terms of gameplay and aesthetics , specifically by adding a layer of emphasis on characterization and themes .
Another influence was the 2005 Nintendo DS title Lost in Blue , which contains similar supernatural elements and a day / night cycle .
The game 's dark and supernatural yet cartoonish art style was influenced by the work of filmmaker Tim Burton , to which it has been frequently compared , and by writers Edward Gorey and H.P. Lovecraft .
Forbes noted the team 's ambition of creating something " dark and creepy . "
After conception of the basic game setup , Forbes penned a backstory influenced by steampunk and horror , and lead creative director
Jeff Agala added comic strip - like art elements .
To further the game 's atmosphere of loneliness and directionlessness , Klei decided firmly against multiplayer gameplay .
However , in December 2014 , after numerous requests , Klei finally released the multiplayer version of the game titled " Do n't Starve Together " on Steam Early Access after an initial closed beta release .
Development was marked by a few changes to the game 's formula that would be reverted .
Most notably , at one point during development , Klei wanted to add quests to the existing open gameplay .
Klei shelved this idea when they realized that " having external goals is extremely counter to what is fun about the game . "
Nevertheless , Klei co - founder Jamie Cheng has emphasized that Klei values the freedom to try different approaches that being tied to a major publisher would not afford them .
Cheng related in an interview that Do n't Starves development taught Klei a considerable amount about the nature of the emergent gameplay that was endemic to its open and random world ; Klei tries to experiment with a new genre with each project and prefers not to create sequels to any of its games .
These lessons would later be used to balance the mechanics of Klei 's upcoming project Invisible , Inc. RELEASES AND UPDATES Section::::Releases and updates .
Klei employees argued at length about whether to release Do n't Starve as a free - to - play game .
Forbes stated that he " would n't rule it out as a business model " but that the team was not ready to make such a decision .
It was , however , free in the early days of beta testing .
Do n't Starve was released in beta form in 2012 , a move that Klei decided on to find out " what aspects of the game players are really responding to , and [ nip ]
usability issues in the bud .
"
Klei 's Cory Rollins has stated that he finds that most developers ' beta periods simply serve as an early release of the game and result in few glitches being fixed , and wanted to make more use of the strategy .
Added benefits the team discovered during beta testing were that it forced them to make important decisions about the game 's upcoming release well in advance , and that it solidified a player base .
In addition , Klei added the ability for food to spoil during this time , inspired by a forum thread about such possibilities .
Cheng found Do n't Starve to have " ended up a way better game because of the community .
" It spent a few months in beta testing , and Klei continued to give updates for months after its release .
In June 2013 , shortly after the game 's main release , a PlayStation 4 version was announced ; it would not be released until January of the following year .
In a January 2014 interview , Rollins mentioned internal discussions of creating a PlayStation Vita version of Do n't Starve , citing massive community interest in playing it on the PlayStation 4 remotely .
An iOS edition was released in July 2014 .
The company is also considering other mobile phone adaptations , as well as a potential sequel , but is not prioritizing them .

RECEPTION Section::::Reception .
Do n't Starve received " generally favorable " reviews , according to video game review aggregator Metacritic .
The game sold one million copies by the end of 2013 .
Do n't Starve was a finalist for the grand prize and
" Excellence in Design " subcategory at the 2014 Independent Games Festival awards ceremony .
It also received honorable mentions for " Excellence in Visual Art " and " Excellence in Audio . "
The game 's art style was critically acclaimed .
Summarizing that the " distinct art style and atmosphere set a cool vibe , " GameSpot 's Nathan Meunier commended the atmosphere and visual design .
Marty Sliva of IGN claimed an " immense appreciation for the paper - cutout graphical style and whimsical presentation " , going on to praise the threatening qualities bestowed upon mundane objects by the " gothic - inspired look . "
Game Informer writer Jeff Marchiafava stated that " the cartoony art style makes exploring your massive , randomized world a joy . "
Writing for the newspaper Toronto Sun , Steve Tilley called the art " whimsical and wonderful " and the presentation in general " captivating . "
Reviewing the PlayStation 4 version specifically , Jordan Devore of Destructoid said that it looked and played very well on the console , though he did note some pixelation effects when the screen zooms in on the inventory .
He also found that the gamepad controls , while less efficient than a keyboard , were similarly enjoyable .
The music was generally well received .
Sliva compared it to carnival music and called it " immediately catchy " though lacking in variation .
Giancarlo Saldana of GamesRadar called it " eerie [ yet ] calming " and praised its role in complementing the simultaneously lonesome and dangerous world .
Critics universally acknowledged but gave mixed opinions on the game 's high level of difficulty .
This sentiment was captured by Sliva 's comment that " Do n't Starve will never , ever hold your hand , and I both love it and hate it for that . "
For example , he felt some of his deaths were unfairly caused by the game 's camera system obscuring needed objects .
Meunier stated that " survival does n't come easy , but there 's an undeniable thrill to the challenge , " but also placed the high difficulty in his list of the game 's cons .
Leon Hurley of Official PlayStation Magazine claimed that " learning is half the fun and even the smallest victory makes you feel like you 're winning with a capital FU .
"
Reviewers also felt that players ' levels of satisfaction would depend heavily on their levels of commitment to survival .
The lack of a permanent saving mechanic and permanence of death were criticized .
Marchiafava , while normally a fan of permadeath in games , found it problematic in Do n't Starve because , unlike other games such as The Binding of Isaac and Spelunky , Do n't Starve is much longer and so death felt like more of a loss .
Meunier noted that the novelty and thrills of each new run wear off somewhat " when you 're stuck tackling the same menial tasks over and over again to regain lost ground .
"
Sliva expressed disappointment at being given "
nearly no recognition from Do n't Starve itself " upon being killed by a frog , and reported being bored for roughly 30 minutes at the overly familiar starts of later playthroughs .
Brown thought similarly , also calling the early game in particular " a bit dull . "
Saldana , however , reasoned that " you at least gain some knowledge of how things work " and would make incremental , enjoyable progress .
The variety of unusual , numerous , and frequently placed ways for the player to die were singled out for praise .
Focusing on the harm caused by subzero temperatures during winter , Meunier found that " these interesting wrinkles add depth and additional difficulty to the already challenging survival mechanics at play . "
Jessica Conditt of Joystiq praised the high number of ways to die and the game 's efficient , easy - to - understand display of the player 's health , hunger , and mental stability .
Saldana noted that the unfamiliarity of some monster designs would help to keep the player wary .
