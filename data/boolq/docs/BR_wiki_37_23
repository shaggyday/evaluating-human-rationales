ETHIOPIAN CALENDAR
The Ethiopian calendar (; yä'Ityoṗṗya zëmän aḳoṭaṭär ) is the principal calendar used in Ethiopia and also serves as the liturgical year for Christians in Eritrea and Ethiopia belonging to the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church , Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church , Eastern Catholic Churches , the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria , and Ethiopian - Eritrean Evangelicalism ( Ethiopian - Eritrean Protestants in the diaspora usually use both the Ethiopian and Gregorian Calendars for liturgical purposes , by celebrating religious holidays twice ) .
It is a solar calendar which in turn derives from the Egyptian calendar , but like the Julian calendar , it adds a leap day every four years without exception , and begins the year on August 29 or August 30 in the Julian calendar .
A gap of 7–8 years between the Ethiopian and Gregorian calendars results from an alternative calculation in determining the date of the Annunciation .
Like the Coptic calendar , the Ethiopic calendar has 12 months of 30 days plus 5 or 6 epagomenal days , which comprise a thirteenth month .
The Ethiopian months begin on the same days as those of the Coptic calendar , but their names are in Ge'ez .
A 6th epagomenal day is added every 4 years , without exception , on August 29 of the Julian calendar , 6 months before the corresponding Julian leap day .
Thus the first day of the Ethiopian year , 1 Mäskäräm , for years between 1900 and 2099 ( inclusive ) , is usually September 11
( Gregorian ) .
However , it falls on September 12 in years before the Gregorian leap year .
NEW YEAR 'S DAY Section::::New Year 's Day .
Enkutatash is the word for the Ethiopian New Year in Amharic , the official language of Ethiopia , while it is called Ri'se Awde Amet ( " Head Anniversary " ) in Ge'ez , the term preferred by the Ethiopian & Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Churchs .
It occurs on September 11th in the Gregorian Calendar ; except for the year preceding a leap year , when it occurs on September 12th .
The Ethiopian Calendar Year 1998
Amätä Məhrät ( " Year of Mercy " ) began on the Gregorian Calendar Year on September 11th , 2005 .
However , the Ethiopian Years 1992 and 1996 began on the Gregorian Dates of ' September 12th 1999 ' and ' 2003 ' respectively .
This date correspondence applies for the Gregorian years 1900 to 2099 .
The Ethiopian leap year is every four without exception , while Gregorian centurial years are only leap years when exactly divisible by 400 ; thus a set of corresponding dates will most often apply for a single century .
As the Gregorian year 2000 is a leap year , the current correspondence lasts two centuries instead .
The start of the Ethiopian year ( Feast of El - Nayrouz ) falls on August 29th or 30th (
in the year just before the Julian leap year ) .
This date corresponds to the Old - Style Julian Calendar ; therefore , the start of the year has been transferred forward in the currently used Gregorian Calendar to September 11th or 12th ( in the year just before the Julian leap year ) .
This deviation between the Julian and the Gregorian Calendar will increase with the passing of the time .

ERAS Section::::Eras .
To indicate the year , Ethiopians and followers of the Eritrean churches today use the Incarnation Era , which dates from the Annunciation or Incarnation of Jesus on March 25 , AD 9 ( Julian ) , as calculated by Annianus of Alexandria c. 400 ; thus its first civil year began 7 months earlier on August 29 , AD 8 .
Meanwhile , Europeans eventually adopted the calculations made by Dionysius Exiguus in AD 525 instead , which placed the Annunciation 8 years earlier than had Annianus .
This causes the Ethiopian year number to be 8 years less than the Gregorian year number from January 1 until September 10 or 11 , then 7 years less for the remainder of the Gregorian year .
In the past , a number of other eras for numbering years were also widely used in Ethiopia and the Kingdom of Aksum .
ERA OF MARTYRS Section::::Era of Martyrs .
The most important era – once widely used by the Eastern Christianity , and still used by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria – was the Era of Martyrs , also known as the Diocletian Era , or the era of Diocletian and the Martyrs , whose first year began on August 29 , 284 .
Respective to the Gregorian and Julian New Year 's Days , 3 to 4 months later , the difference between the Era of Martyrs and the Anni Domini is 285 years ( 285= 15×19 ) .
This is because in AD 525 , Dionysius Exiguus decided to add 15 Metonic cycles to the existing 13 Metonic cycles of the Diocletian Era ( 15×19 + 13×19 = 532 ) to obtain an entire 532 year medieval Easter cycle , whose first cycle ended with the year Era of Martyrs 247 (= 13×19 ) equal to year DXXXI .
It is also because 532 is the product of the Metonic cycle of 19 years and the solar cycle of 28 years .
ANNO MUNDI
ACCORDING TO PANODOROS Section::::Anno Mundi according to Panodoros .
Around AD 400 , an Alexandrine monk called Panodoros fixed the Alexandrian Era ( Anno Mundi =
in the year of the world ) , the date of creation , on 29 August 5493 BC .
After the 6th century AD , the era was used by Egyptian and Ethiopian chronologists .
The twelfth 532 year - cycle of this era began on 29 August AD 360 , and so 4×19 years after the Era of Martyrs .
ANNO MUNDI
ACCORDING TO ANIANOS Section::::Anno Mundi according to Anianos .
Bishop Anianos preferred the Annunciation style as New Year 's Day , 25 March ( see above ) .
Thus he shifted the Panodoros era by about six months , to begin on 25 March 5492 BC .
In the Ethiopian calendar this was equivalent to 15 Magabit 5501 B.C. ( E.C. ) .
The Anno Mundi era remained in usage until the late 19th century .
LEAP YEAR
CYCLE Section::::Leap year cycle .
The 4 year leap - year cycle is associated with the four Evangelists : the first year after an Ethiopian leap year is named the John - year , followed by the Matthew - year , and then the Mark - year .
The year with the 6th epagomenal day is traditionally designated as the Luke - year .
There are no exceptions to the 4 year leap - year cycle , like the Julian calendar but unlike the Gregorian calendar .

These dates are valid only from March 1900 to February 2100 .
This is because 1900 and 2100 are not leap years in the Gregorian calendar , while they are still leap years in the Ethiopian calendar , meaning dates before 1900 and after 2100 will be offset .
