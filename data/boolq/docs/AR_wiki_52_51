rowspan=2 Blood Pressure ( mmHg )
Systolic 80–110 colspan=2 Heart rate ( BPM ) 90–140
colspan=2 Respiratory rate 20–40 Toddler development can be broken down into a number of interrelated areas .
There is reasonable consensus about what these areas may include : *
Physical : growth or an increase in size .
* Gross motor : the control of large muscles which enable walking , running , jumping and climbing .
* Fine motor : the ability to control small muscles ; enabling the toddler to feed themselves , draw and manipulate objects .
* Vision : the ability to see near and far and interpret what is seen .
* Hearing and speech : the ability to hear and receive information and listen ( interpret ) , and the ability to understand and learn language and use it to communicate effectively .
* Social : the ability to interact with the world through playing with others , taking turns and fantasy play .
Although it is useful to chart defined periods of development , it is also necessary to recognize that development exists on a continuum , with considerable individual differences between children .
There is a wide range of what may be considered ' normal ' development .
However , according to experts , there are specific milestones that should be achieved by certain ages and stages in life in order to properly grow and develop .

throwing and retrieving objects
Suggested toys :
* Play furniture , dishes , cooking utensils , play telephone , puzzles with large pieces , pedal propelled toys , rocking horse , clay crayons , finger paints , pounding toys , blocks , push - pull toys , balls SQUATTING Section::::Squatting .
Young children squat instinctively as a continuous movement from standing up whenever they want to lower themselves to ground level .
One- and two - year - olds can commonly be seen playing in a stable squatting position , with feet wide apart and bottom not quite touching the floor , although at first they need to hold on to something to stand up again .
LANGUAGE Section::::Language .
Talking is the next milestone of which parents are typically aware .
A toddler 's first word most often occurs around 12 months , but again this is only an average .
The child will then continue to steadily add to his or her vocabulary until around the age of 18 months when language increases rapidly .
He or she may learn as many as 7–9 new words a day .
Around this time , toddlers generally know about 50 words .
At 21 months is when toddlers begin to incorporate two word phrases into their vocabulary , such as " I go " , " mama give " , and " baby play " .
Before going to sleep they often engage in a monologue called crib talk in which they practice conversational skills .
At this age , children are becoming very proficient at conveying their wants and needs to their parents in a verbal fashion .
EMOTIONS AND SELF - IMAGE
Section::::Emotions and self - image .
There are several other important milestones that are achieved in this time period that parents tend not to emphasize as much as walking and talking .
Gaining the ability to point at whatever it is the child wants you to see shows huge psychological gains in a toddler .
This generally happens before a child 's first birthday .
This age is sometimes referred to as " the terrible twos " , because of the temper tantrums for which they are famous .
This stage can begin as early as nine months old depending on the child and environment .
Toddlers tend to have temper tantrums because they have such strong emotions but do not know how to express themselves the way that older children and adults do .
They also throw tantrums to let others know that they are free and can do what they want .
The toddler is discovering that they are a separate being from their parent and are testing their boundaries in learning the way the world around them works .
Although the toddler is in their exploratory phase , it is also important to understand that the methods used by the parents for communicating with the toddler can either set off a tantrum or calm the situation .
Research has shown that parents with histories of maltreatment , violence exposure , and related psychopathology may have particular difficulty in responding sensitively and in a developmentally appropriate manner to their toddlers ' tantrums and thus may benefit from parent - child mental health consultation .
This time between the ages of two and five when they are reaching for independence repeats itself during adolescence .
Self - awareness is another milestone that helps parents understand how a toddler is reacting .
Around 18 months of age , a child will begin to recognize himself or herself as a separate physical being with his / her own thoughts and actions .
A parent can test if this milestone has been reached by noticing if the toddler recognizes that their reflection in a mirror is in fact themselves .
One way to test this is the rouge test : putting lipstick on the child 's face and showing them their own reflection .
Upon seeing the out - of - the - ordinary mark , if the child reaches to his or her own face , the child has achieved this important milestone .
Along with self recognition comes feelings of embarrassment and pride that the child had not previously experienced .
