The Dominican Republic and Mexico are two Latin American nations that were once colonized by the Spanish empire .

In March 1890 , a treaty of ' Friendship , Navigation and Commerce ' was signed between both nations .
In 1929 , resident diplomatic missions were established in each other 's capitals , respectively .

From 1930 - 1938 and again in 1942 until his death in 1961 ; the Dominican Republic was ruled by President Rafael Trujillo .
During this time period , relations between the two nations were cold at best .
Mexico granted political asylum to several Dominican politicians and leading figures who were escaping persecuting in their country .
After the death of Trujillo in 1961 , relations improved between the two nations .
In April 1965 , the United States government under President Lyndon B. Johnson feared that the Dominican Republic would turn into a ' second Cuba ' after the assassination of Trujillo and sent in the marines to occupy the country .
Mexico vehemently condemned American occupation of the country and Mexico did not participate in the OAS contingency force to oversee events in the country .
Soon after the election of President Joaquín Balaguer , American marines pulled out of the country in July 1966 and diplomatic relations between Mexico and the Dominican Republic returned to normal .
