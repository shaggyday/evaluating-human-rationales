FETUS IN FETU Fetus in fetu ( or foetus in foetu ) is a developmental abnormality in which a mass of tissue resembling a fetus forms inside the body .
An early example of the phenomenon was described in 1808 by George William Young .
There are two theories of origin concerning " fetus in fetu " .
One theory is that the mass begins as a normal fetus but becomes enveloped inside its twin .
The other theory is that the mass is a highly developed teratoma . "
Fetus in fetu " is estimated to occur in 1 in 500,000 live births .
CLASSIFICATION AS LIFE Section::::Classification as life .
A fetus in fetu can be considered alive , but only in the sense that its component tissues have not yet died or been eliminated .
Thus , the life of a fetus in fetu is akin to that of a tumor in that its cells remain viable by way of normal metabolic activity .
However , without the gestational conditions in utero with the amnion and placenta , a fetus in fetu can develop into , at best , an especially well differentiated teratoma ; or , at worst , a high - grade metastatic teratocarcinoma .
In terms of physical maturation , its organs have a working blood supply from the host , but all cases of fetus in fetu present critical defects , such as no functional brain , heart , lungs , gastrointestinal tract , or urinary tract .
Accordingly , while a fetus in fetu can share select morphological features with a normal fetus , it has no prospect of any life outside of the host twin .
Moreover , it poses clear threats to the life of the host twin on whom its own life depends .
THEORIES OF DEVELOPMENT Section::::Theories of development .
There are two main theories about the development of fetus in fetu .
TERATOMA THEORY Section::::Teratoma theory .
Fetus in fetu may be a very highly differentiated form of dermoid cyst , itself a highly differentiated form of mature teratoma .
PARASITIC TWIN THEORY
Section::::Parasitic twin theory .
Fetus in fetu may be a parasitic twin fetus growing within its host twin .
Very early in a monozygotic twin pregnancy , in which both fetuses share a common placenta , one fetus wraps around and envelops the other .
The enveloped twin becomes a parasite , in that its survival depends on the survival of the host twin , by drawing on the host twin 's blood supply .
The parasitic twin is anencephalic ( without a brain ) and lacks some internal organs , and as such is unable to survive on its own .
As the host twin has to " feed " the enveloped twin from the nutrients received over a single umbilical cord , they usually die before birth .
