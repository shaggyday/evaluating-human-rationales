AWARDS AND DECORATIONS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD Awards and decorations of the National Guard are presented to members of the United States National Guard and sometimes to members of the state defense forces in addition to regular United States military decorations .
Each of the state governments of the United States maintains a series of military decorations for issuance to members of the National Guard , with such awards presented under the authority of the various state adjutants general .
Those National Guard soldiers and airmen who subsequently serve in the active or reserve federal forces of the United States Army , Navy , Marine Corps , Coast Guard , or United States Air Force ( i.e. , as active duty or reserve members of the Army , Navy , Air Force , Marine Corps , or Coast Guard ) may not continue to wear and display such decorations on a military uniform , unless such activation is under Title 32 status .
Active duty regulations allow federal soldiers , airmen , sailors and marines to accept but not to wear state awards .
Most states authorize the wear of other states ' awards if a soldier or airman has earned awards from a state or territory to which he or she is not presently assigned .
The order of precedence is typically the presently assigned state , followed by awards from the District of Columbia , then other states by their order of admission .
The following is a list of National Guard decorations , as issued by each of the fifty United States ; Puerto Rico , Guam , the U.S. Virgin Islands , and the District of Columbia .
