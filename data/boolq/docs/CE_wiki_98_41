PUBLICATION HISTORY Section::::Publication history .
Roy Thomas recounted ,
The team first appeared in the partial reprint title Marvel Super - Heroes with issue # 18 ( Jan. 1969 ) , written by Arnold Drake and penciled by Gene Colan .
Despite strong sales on this issue , the Guardians of the Galaxy would not appear again for over five years , in Marvel Two -
In - One # 4–5
( July – Sept . 1974 ) .
The story 's writer , Steve Gerber , liked the team enough to use them again in Giant Size Defenders # 5 and Defenders # 26–29 ( July – Nov . 1975 ) .
In each case , other heroes such as Captain America , the Thing , and the Defenders aid them in their war against the alien Badoon , necessitating the liberal use of time travel in these stories .
The Guardians were finally given their own series , Marvel Presents , starting with issue # 3 ( Feb. 1976 ) .
Steve Gerber , still handling the writing chores , reflected , " Most of the stories I was scripting were set in the present .
I wanted to do something that combined the standard superhero elements with something a little different , so that I could give my imagination a bit more play .
We had Dave Cockrum redesign the costumes , we created a new starship for them to pilot , and we revised the premise of the strip , so that they were no longer fighting the Badoon on Earth , and sent them off amongst the stars .
" Gerber left the series after seven issues , leaving Roger Stern to take over with Marvel Presents # 10 .
The series was cancelled shortly afterwards due to poor sales , with the final issue being # 12 ( August 1977 ) .
This was followed by a series of appearances in Thor Annual # 6 ( 1977 ) ,
The Avengers # 167–177 ( Jan.–Nov . 1978 ) and # 181 ( March 1979 ) , Ms. Marvel # 23 , Marvel Team - Up # 86 ( Oct. 1979 ) , and Marvel Two - in - One # 61–63 & # 69 ( Nov. 1980 ) .
Marvel Two - in - One
# 69 drastically changed the Guardians of the Galaxy story ; due to changes made to the past of one of the members , the future which the Guardians of the Galaxy come from and the mainstream Marvel Universe are permanently separated , becoming alternate timelines to each other .
After this , the Guardians of the Galaxy were absent from published stories for over a decade .
In 1989 , Marvel editor - in - chief Tom DeFalco decided to revive the Guardians of the Galaxy in order to cash in on the soaring popularity of the TV series .
DeFalco worked out a series concept using a new team of Guardians , but when he saw a series proposal for the original team that Jim Valentino had coincidentally been working on at the same time , he green lit Valentino 's idea instead .
The Guardians ' first self - titled comic launched in June 1990 and ran for 62 issues .
This series was initially written and illustrated by Valentino , who deliberately gave it an action - oriented , " fun " feel that stood out from the typical " grim ' n ' gritty " comics of the 1990s .
Though Valentino had plotted the series ahead as far as issue # 50 , his run was cut short when he co - founded Image Comics .
Having taken on two new series and the foundation of a publication company , Valentino asked editor Craig Anderson if he could switch to just writing Guardians of the Galaxy , and in response Anderson dismissed him from the series .
With issue # 29 ( Oct. 1992 )
Michael Gallagher commenced writing the title , and continued until its cancellation with issue # 62 ( July 1995 ) .
According to Kevin West , who became the penciller with issue # 30 ( Nov. 1992 ) , he and Gallagher worked together closely on the series , employing the Marvel method of creation , and soon became good friends .
A spin - off four - issue miniseries , Galactic Guardians ( July – Oct . 1994 ) , also by Gallagher and West , appeared during this time .
West explained why he did not draw the final issue of Guardians of the Galaxy : " When I heard we were getting the hook , I naturally started looking for a new job .
I ended up at Malibu .
There was a hold - up getting the Guardians plot finished so by the time I got it , I had to pass because I had a Malibu deadline to meet .
Arrgh .
Despite any minor qualms I had , I really did enjoy working on the series . "
A second volume was published in May 2008 , written by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning .
The title , set in a different timeline , features a new team , drawn from participants in the storyline .
The 1969 team made guest appearances in # 12–17 and # 25 .
A new ongoing series starring the original Guardians , titled Guardians 3000 and written by Abnett , launched in 2014 .
FICTIONAL TEAM
HISTORY
Section::::Fictional team history .
The Guardians are active in the 31st century in an alternative time - line of the Marvel Universe known as Earth-691 .
The original members of the team include Major Vance Astro ( later known as Major Victory ) , an astronaut from 20th century Earth who spends a thousand years travelling to Alpha Centauri in suspended animation .
He is also the future alternative universe counterpart of Vance Astrovik , the hero known as Justice .
Other original team members are Martinex T'Naga , a crystalline being from Pluto ; Captain Charlie-27 , a soldier from Jupiter ; and Yondu Udonta , a blue - skinned " noble savage " from Centauri - IV ( the fourth planet orbiting the star Alpha Centauri B ) .
Each is apparently the last of their kind and they are forced to unite as a team against the actions of the Badoon , an alien race which attempts to conquer Earth 's solar system .
During the course of the war against the Badoon , the team gains three more members — the mysterious husband and wife duo , Starhawk and Aleta , as well as Nikki , a genetically engineered young girl from Mercury seeking excitement in her life — and travel back in time , where they encounter several of the heroes of 20th century Earth , including Captain America and the Thing .
The Guardians eventually defeat the Badoon , but soon find themselves facing a new foe called Korvac , who was in part a creation of the Badoon .
After teaming with the Thunder God Thor to defeat Korvac in the 31st century , the Guardians then follow Korvac to 20th century mainstream Earth , where together with the Avengers they fight a final battle .
The Guardians reappear years later and have a series of adventures in their future , with several others eventually joining the team : the Inhuman Talon , the Skrull , the second Yellowjacket ( alias Rita DeMara of the 20th century ) , and an aged Simon Williams ( now called Hollywood , Man of Wonder ) .
Wanting to expand the Guardians to a multiple team organization , Martinex eventually leaves the team to look for additional members for a second unit , nicknamed the Galactic Guardians .
CONNECTION TO THE " MODERN " GUARDIANS Section::::Connection to the " Modern " Guardians .
During their second mission , the team that was to become the Earth-616 incarnation of the Guardians discover a time displaced Vance Astro in a block of ice floating in space .
It is his introduction as " Major Victory of the Guardians of the Galaxy " that inspires the team to take up the name .
In # 7 and # 16 of the series , it was revealed a great " error " in the present day has caused the future to be destroyed — Starhawk is constantly trying to prevent it by time travel , causing the future ( and the Guardians ) to be altered .
Only Starhawk , who is changed with each reboot but is " one who knows " about the changes , realizes anything is different , but each change still ends in a cataclysm .
In # 17 , the universe of the Guardians ' future had been taken over by the alien race called the Badoon , and only a small portion remained undestroyed .
The Guardians sent a warning to the present day , though at the cost of the end of their own universe .
The Vance Astro of the modern - day
Guardians is revealed to be a Major Victory from one of these altered futures , rather than the original .
A second alternate Vance Astro appears in # 17 .
In # 18 , a third version of the Guardians ' future was shown : this time led by Killraven against the Martians .
