PORK ROLL Pork roll ( also known regionally as Taylor ham ) is a pork - based processed meat commonly available in New Jersey , New York , Delaware and parts of Pennsylvania and Maryland .
It was developed in 1856 by John Taylor of Hamilton Square , New Jersey , and sold as " Taylor 's Prepared Ham " .
Other producers entered the market , and subsequent food labeling regulations required Taylor to designate it as a " pork roll " alongside its competitors .
While " Taylor Ham " is technically a brand of pork roll , in regions of North Jersey all brands of pork roll may be referred as Taylor Ham due to John Taylor branding his original pork roll as Taylor .
ORIGIN AND DESCRIPTION Section::::Origin and description .
While a similar item , packed minced ham , may have been produced at the time of the Battle of Trenton , John Taylor is credited with creating his secret recipe for the product in 1856 .
George Washington Case , a farmer and butcher from nearby Belle Mead , New Jersey , later created his own recipe for pork roll in 1870 .
Case 's was reportedly packaged in corn husks .
Taylor originally called his product " Taylor 's Prepared Ham " , but was forced to change the name after it failed to meet the new legal definition of " ham " established by the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 .
Marketed as both " Taylor 's Pork Roll " and " Trenton Pork Roll " , it saw competition from products with similar names like " Rolled Pork " and " Trenton style Pork Roll " .
When their makers were sued by Taylor a 1910 legal case ruled that the words " Pork Roll " could not be trademarked .
In North Jersey , residents continue to use the term Taylor Ham , while South Jersey residents generally use the term Pork Roll , with Central Jersey residents using a mix of the two .
In the 1910 lawsuit , it was described as " a food article made of pork , packed in a cylindrical cotton sack or bag in such form that it could be quickly prepared for cooking by slicing without removal from the bag . "
Larry Olmsted of USA Today has described the taste of the meat as " a cross between Canadian bacon and bacon , less hammy and smoky than Canadian , fattier and saltier than bacon , with a unique texture , both crispy and slightly mushy . "
Companies that make pork roll include Case 's Pork Roll , Loeffler 's Gourmet , Hatfield Quality Meats and Alderfer Premium of Harleysville , Pennsylvania .
