TAPE MEASURE
A tape measure or measuring tape is a flexible ruler and used to measure distance .
It consists of a ribbon of cloth , plastic , fibre glass , or metal strip with linear - measurement markings .
It is a common measuring tool .
Its design allows for a measure of great length to be easily carried in pocket or toolkit and permits one to measure around curves or corners .
Today it is ubiquitous , even appearing in miniature form as a keychain fob , or novelty item .
Surveyors use tape measures in lengths of over 100 m. TYPES Section::::Types .
There are two basic types of tape measures with cases , spring return pocket tape measures and long tape measures .
Spring return pocket tape measures will generally fit in a pocket .
They are small , the case is up to about three inches across .
The tape is returned to the case by a spring mechanism .
Pocket tape measures have a tape one foot to fifteen feet in length and ¼ to ¾ inches across .
When most people think of a tape measure , they are thinking of the pocket tape measure .
A second tape measure design is what is called the long tape .
These are cased tape measures with tapes of 25 , 50 , 75 , 100 , 200 , 300 , and even 500 feet in length , designed for engineers and builders .
Because surveying was usually done in rods , surveyors use long tapes of 33 feet ( 2 rods ) , and 66 feet ( 4 rods ) .
Surveyors also used 49½ feet of a 50-foot tape for 3 rods and 99 feet of a 100-foot tape measure for 6 rods .
Long tapes instead of being returned by a spring , were usually returned by hand crank .
Tape measures are often designed for specific uses or trades .
Tapes may have different scales , be made of different materials , and be of different lengths depending on the use it is intended for .
Tape measures that were intended for use in tailoring or dressmaking were made from flexible cloth or plastic .
They are named " sewing tape " .
These types of tape measures were mainly used for the measuring of the subject 's waist line .
Today , measuring tapes made for sewing are made of fiberglass , which does not tear or stretch as easily .
Measuring tapes designed for carpentry or construction often use a stiff , curved metallic ribbon that can remain stiff and straight when extended , but retracts into a coil for convenient storage .
This type of tape measure will have a floating tang or hook on the end to aid measuring .
The tang is connected to the tape with loose rivets through oval holes , and can move a distance equal to its thickness , to provide both inside and outside measurements that are accurate .
A tape measure of 25 or even 100 feet can wind into a relatively small container .
The self - marking tape measure allows the user an accurate one hand measure .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The first record of people using a measuring device was by the Romans using marked strips of leather , but this was more like a regular ruler than a tape measure .
On December 6 , 1864 patent # 45,372 was issued to William H. Bangs of West Meriden , Connecticut .
Bang 's rule was the first attempt in the United States to make a spring return pocket tape measure .
The tape could be stopped at any point and held by the mechanism .
The tape could be returned to the case by sliding a button on the side of the case which then allowed the spring to pull the tape back into the case .
On 3 January 1922 , Hiram A. Farrand received patent # 1,402,589 for his concave - convex tape , a major improvement for spring pocket tape measures .
Between 1922 and December 1926 , Farrand experimented with the help of The Hipolito Company in Cainta Autoplex .
It is there Farrand and William Wentworth Brown
began mass - producing the tape measure .
Their product was later sold to Stanley Works .
It was Farrand 's concave - convex tape that went on to become the standard for the majority of pocket tape measure tapes today
The first patented for a long tape measure in the United States was patent # 29,096 issued July 10 , 1860 to William H. Paine of Sheboygan , Wisconsin , and produced by George M. Eddy and Company of Brooklyn , New York .
This tape had no increments on it .
It accurately measured only a distance equal to the total length of the tape from beginning to end marker , a brass piece attached to the tape at a measured distance .
The measured length was marked on the case or crank .
Later , by the early 1870s , Justus Roe of Patchogue , New York added rivets attaching small brass washers , to the tape to mark inches and feet .
They were attached ever inch in the first and last foot and every foot from one to the end of the last foot .
A small brass tag , marked with a number indicating the number of feet to that point , was attached every five feet .
This feature was never patented , but Justus Roe and Sons produced tape measures , " Roe Electric Reel Tape Measures " , with this feature until 1895 when they started etching or stamping increments and numbers on the tapes .
( The " electric " part of the name was purely an affectation ; there was nothing electrical about it . )
DESIGN Section::::Design .
The basic design on which all modern spring tape measures are built can trace its origins back to an 1864 patent by a West Meriden , Connecticut resident named
William H. Bangs Jr. According to the text of his patent , Bang 's tape measure was an improvement on other versions previously designed .
The spring tape measure has existed in the U.S. since Bang 's patent in 1864 , but its usage did not become very popular due to the difficulty in communication from one town to another and the expense of the tape measure .
In the late 1920s , carpenters began slowly adopting H. A. Farrand 's design as the one more commonly used .
Farrand 's new design was a concave / convex tape made of metal which would stand straight out a distance of four to six feet .
This design is the basis for most modern pocket tape measures used today .
With the mass production of the integrated circuit ( IC ) the tape measure has also entered into the digital age with the digital tape measure .
Some incorporate a digital screen to give measurement readouts in multiple formats .
An early patent for this type of measure was published in 1977 .
There are also other styles of tape measures that have incorporated lasers and ultrasonic technology to measure the distance of an object with fairly reliable accuracy .
Tape measures often have black and red measurements on a yellow background as this is the optimal color combination for readability .
UNITED STATES Section::::United States .
Justus Roe , a surveyor and tape - maker by trade , made the longest tape measure in 1956 , at .
The Northern Virginia Surveyors Association presented the 600-foot , gold - plated surveyor 's tape measure to Mickey Mantle in 1956 .
Some tapes sold in the United States have additional marks in the shape of small black diamonds , which appear every .
These are used to mark out equal spacing for joists ( five joists or trusses per standard length of building material ) .
Many tapes also have special markings every , which is a standard interval for studs in construction .
Three spaces of 16 inches make exactly which is the commercial width of a sheet of plywood , gyprock or particle board .
It should also be mentioned that the sale of dual metric / customary scale tapes is slowly becoming common in the United States .
For example , in some Walmarts there are Hyper Tough brand tapes available in US customary units and Metric units .
Unlike US rulers , of which an overwhelming majority contain both cm and inch scales , tape measures are longer and thus traditionally have had scales in both inches and feet + inches .
So , inclusion of a metric scale requires the measuring device to either contain 3 scales of measure or the elimination of one of the customary scales .
The use of millimeter only tape measures for housing construction is a part of the US metric building code .
The use of centimeters is not allowed .
Millimeters produce whole ( integer ) numbers , reduce arithmetic errors , decreasing scrap .
Australia , Bangladesh , Botswana , Cameroon , India , Kenya , Mauritius , New Zealand , Pakistan , South Africa , United Kingdom , and Zimbabwe all use millimeters only as their unit for building construction .
The separation between studs is 600 millimeters which has 24 different divisors easing calculation .
The metric roll - up tape shown is a millimeter only tape measure .
The dual scale Stanley tape measure is US inches and centimeters .
UNITED KINGDOM Section::::United Kingdom .
Tape measures sold in the UK often have dual scales for metric and imperial units .
Like the American tape measures described above , they also have markings every and .
CANADA Section::::Canada .
Tape measures sold in Canada often have dual scales for metric and imperial units .
All tapes in imperial units have markings every , but not at every .
IN SURVEYING Section::::In surveying .
Tapes are used in surveying for measuring Horizontal , vertical or slope distances .
Tapes are issued in various lengths and widths and graduated in variety of ways .
The measuring tapes used for surveying purposes are classified in 4 types according to the material from which they are manufactured : * Linen or Cloth Tape .
It is made of linen cloth with brass handle at zero end whose length is included in the tape length .
It is very light and handy , but can not withstand much wear and tear .
So it can not be used for accurate work .
It is little used in surveying except for taking subsidiary measurements like offsets .
* * Metallic Tape .
The tape is reinforced with copper wires to prevent stretching or twisting of fibers and is then called as metallic tape .
They are available in many lengths but tapes of 20 m and 30 m are more commonly used .
* * Steel Tape .
It is made of steel ribbon varying in width from 6 mm to 16 mm .
It is available in lengths of 1 , 2 , 10 , 30 and 50 meters .
It can not withstand rough usage and therefore it should be used with great care .
* * Invar Tape .
It is made of an alloy of steel ( 64 % ) and nickel ( 36 % ) .
It is 6 mm wide and is available in lengths of 30 m , 50 m and 100 m.
It is costly and delicate and should be thus handled with great care .
