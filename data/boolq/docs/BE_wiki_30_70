GOAL ( ICE HOCKEY )
In ice hockey , a goal is scored when the puck entirely crosses the goal line between the two goal posts and below the goal crossbar .
A goal awards one point to the team attacking the goal scored upon , regardless of which team
the player who actually deflected the puck into the goal belongs to ( see also own goal ) .
Typically , a player on the team attempting to score shoots the puck with their stick towards the goal net opening , and a player on the opposing team called a goaltender tries to block the shot to prevent a goal from being scored against their team .
The term goal may also refer to the structure in which goals are scored .
The ice hockey goal is rectangular in shape ; the front frame of the goal is made of steel tube painted red ( or another color depending on the league ) and consists of two vertical goalposts and a horizontal crossbar .
A net is attached to the back of the frame to catch pucks that enter the goal and also to prevent pucks from entering it from behind .
The entire goal is considered an inbounds area of the playing surface , and it is legal to play the puck behind the goal .
Under NHL rules , the opening of the goal is wide by tall , and the footprint of the goal is deep .
METHOD OF SCORING Section::::Method of scoring .
The object of the game of ice hockey is to score more goals than the opposing team .
Goaltenders and defencemen are concerned primarily with keeping the other team from scoring a goal , while forwards are primarily concerned with scoring goals on the other team .
Forwards also have to be defensively responsible while defencemen need to press offensively , and it is not unknown for goalies to attempt to position the puck for a counterattack , or even attempt to shoot against an unguarded net .
For a goal to be scored , the puck normally must entirely cross the goal line between the posts and under the crossbar of the goal frame .
A goal is not allowed under any of the following conditions :
* the puck is sent into the goal from a stick raised above the height of the crossbar
* the puck is intentionally kicked , batted , or thrown into the net by an attacking player ; a puck may deflect off an attacking player 's skate or body provided that player does not make a deliberate attempt to kick or redirect the puck with their body * the puck enters the net directly after deflecting off an official * the goaltender is impeded from preventing the goal by an attacking player
* the scoring team had too many people on ice at the time of the goal *
the goal was scored with a broken stick * the net was dislodged prior to the puck entering it
* the goaltender shoots the puck after crossing the center line
( however , replacing the goaltender with an extra attacker is allowed ) .
* the puck breaks into two or more pieces prior to any portion of it entering the goal .
Additionally , in many leagues , a goal does not count if a player from the attacking team has a skate or stick in the goal crease before the puck .
The National Hockey League ( NHL ) abolished this rule starting in the 1999 - 2000 season after the disputed triple - overtime goal in the 1999 Stanley Cup Finals .
Brett Hull of the Dallas Stars scored the series - clinching goal against the Buffalo Sabres .
There are those who believe that video replay shows Hull 's skate in the crease prior to the puck .
A goal may be awarded if a player would normally be awarded a penalty shot , but the opposing team had substituted a skater for a goaltender .
I such rare cases , a goal is awarded rather than allowing a penalty shot attempt on an empty goal net .
CREDIT FOR GOALS AND ASSISTS Section::::Credit for goals and assists .
Typically , the last player on the goal - scoring team to touch the puck before it goes into the net is credited with scoring that goal .
Zero , one , or two other players on the goal - scoring team may also credited with an assist for helping their teammate to score the goal .
If another player on the goal - scoring team touched the puck to help score the goal before the goal - scoring player touched it without an opposing player intervening ( touching the puck in between ) , then that player gets an assist .
If yet another player on the goal - scoring team also touched the puck before that without an opposing player intervening , then that player also gets an assist .
For a hockey player , a goal or an assist credited to them is also considered a point ; thus the number of goals scored by that player plus the number of assists for them equals the number of points for that player .
However , a rule says that only one point can be credited to any one player on a goal scored .
This means one player can not be credited with a goal and an assist for the same goal scored ; instead the player would only get credit for a goal and a different player may get credit for an assist , if applicable .
It also means that one player can not be credited with two assists for the same goal scored ; instead the player would only get credit for one assist and a different player may get credit for the other assist , if applicable .
Usually on a hockey team , forwards score the most goals and get the most points , although defensemen can score goals and often get assists .
In professional play , goaltenders only occasionally get an assist , and only very rarely score a goal when the opposite net is empty ( without a goaltender ) .
SCORING STATISTICS
Section::::Scoring statistics .
The number of goals scored is a closely watched statistic .
Each year the Rocket Richard Trophy is presented to the NHL player to have scored the most goals .
The trophy is named after Maurice Richard , the first player to score 50 goals in a season , at a time when the NHL regular season was only 50 games ( compared to 82 today ) .
The player to have scored the most goals in an NHL season is Wayne Gretzky .
Gretzky is also the fastest to 50 goals ; during his record - setting 1981–82 season , in which he finished with 92 goals , he scored his 50th goal in the Edmonton Oilers ' 39th game of the season .
The overall amount of goal scoring is also closely watched .
In recent years , goal scoring has decreased .
Many believe the game is less entertaining because of this , and blame the change on the increasing size of goaltending equipment and the advent of defensive systems such as the neutral zone trap .
Fans of defensive hockey counter by saying the high scoring of the 1980s was an anomaly , and this shift represents a return to the norm .
For the 2004 - 05 American Hockey League season , four major rule changes were made that were intended to increase the scoring in games and make it more popular among casual fans : * increasing the size of the attack zones by narrowing the neutral zone two feet each side and thus moving the goal line back two feet
* * restrictions on the goaltender playing the puck *
* permitting offside players to negate the penalty by " tagging up " with the blue line * * changing the offside rule by permitting passes which cross the center line and one blue line ( but not between both blue lines in certain restrictions ) .
* The AHL rules were slightly modified and adopted in the NHL and ECHL for 2005 - 06 , when the NHL returned after the lockout .
TYPES OF GOALS Section::::Types of goals .
There are a number of different types of goals for which separate statistics are kept , but all count equally : *
An even strength goal is a goal scored when both teams have the same number of players on the ice .
* A power play goal ( PPG ) is a goal scored by a team on a power play , that is , with a numerical advantage in players due to a penalty being served by one or more of the other team 's players .
*
A shorthanded goal ( SHG ) is a goal scored by a team that is on the penalty kill , that is , at a numerical disadvantage due to a penalty being served by one or more of its players
* An empty net goal ( ENG ) is a goal scored when there is no goalie guarding the net because he has been pulled for an extra attacker
*
A penalty shot goal is a goal scored on a penalty shot , that is , a one - on - one confrontation between a single offensive player and the goaltender as a result of a penalty * An awarded goal is a goal that is automatically awarded when a goalie has been pulled and their team commits a foul that would otherwise have triggered a penalty shot *
An own goal is when a player puts the puck into their own net , scoring for the other team *
An overtime goal is a goal scored in sudden - death overtime
*
A go - ahead goal is the goal that puts one team ahead of another after the game has been tied * A game - tying goal or an equaliser is a goal that causes the game to be tied , scored by a team that is down one goal ( prior to the 1984 - 85 season , the NHL credited game - tying goals to the final scorers for both teams in tie games ) .
* A game - winning goal ( GWG ) is the goal scored to put the winning team in the lead , e.g. , if the score is 4–2 , the game - winning goal would be the third goal scored for the winning team .

As in all matters , however , the referee retains final authority and can override the opinion of the goal judge .
The two teammates of the scorer who last touched the puck before them , provided that no opponent touched it in between , are each credited with an assist .
Assists and goals count equally to comprise a player 's statistical scoring total .

GOAL HORN Section::::Goal horn .
Ice hockey is one of the few sports along with box lacrosse or indoor soccer in which an air horn , car horn , train horn , foghorn , or siren is used to celebrate a goal .
In every NHL arena , the horn blares after each home team goal .
This has been a trend since the 1970s , when the Chicago Blackhawks installed one .
The only exception to this rule is during the NHL All - Star Game , where the role of that sound is expanded to cover every goal scored , and that the horn only sounds once .
The horns are different depending on the teams , some even have sound effects such as an alarm or the foghorn of a ship , or both combined , for the Washington Capitals and the Anaheim Ducks .
Hockey fans have said that the loudest goal horn belongs to the Anaheim Ducks , who have a very loud fog horn with high bass , or the Philadelphia Flyers , who have a very loud ship 's signaling horn .
Also , during the 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs , the Edmonton Oilers added a second set of horns to the original horn for the second round .
The reason was for that the Oilers had sold out games and the noise level was so loud , that the original horn was getting drowned out by the crowd .
The result was a very loud horn used for the rest of the playoffs .
Along with the horn , it is accompanied by a goal song .
Most arenas play sections of the song where the crowd can " sing " along or repeat .
The two classic goal songs are " Kernkraft 400 " by Zombie Nation ( its " Sport Chant Stadium Remix " arrangement is used by the Boston Bruins ) and " Rock & Roll Part 2 " by Gary Glitter ( first used by the New Jersey Devils ) .
Although , some teams have songs that are original to them , like the now - defunct Hartford Whalers ' famous " Brass Bonanza " , " Bro Hymn " by Pennywise ( originally used by Anaheim and later adopted by Philadelphia and NY Islanders ) , " Crowd Chant " by Joe Satriani ( originally used by Minnesota Wild and the Columbus Blue Jackets ) , " Chelsea Dagger " by The Fratellis ( Chicago ) , " Maria ( I Like It Loud ) " by Scooter feat .
Marc Acardipane and Dick Rules ( originally used in Philadelphia )
, " Party Hard " by Andrew W.K. ( Pittsburgh ) , " Holiday " by Green Day ( originally used by San Jose , later by Vancouver ) , " Le But " by Loco Locass ( originally used by Montreal ) , " Howling for You " by the Black Keys ( Arizona ) , "
I Like It
, I Love It " by Tim McGraw ( Nashville ) , " When the Saints Go Marching In " ( St. Louis ) , and " Let Me Clear My Throat " by DJ Kool ( Buffalo ) .
If the home team wins , the goal horn will also sound at the conclusion of the game , instead of the normal period end horn , with some exceptions , such as the Bruins using their normal period end siren after a win and then followed by " Dirty Water " by The Standells .
