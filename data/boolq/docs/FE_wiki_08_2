SEASHELL RESONANCE
There is a popular folk myth that if one holds a seashell — specifically , most often , a conch shell — to one 's ear , one can hear the sound of the ocean .
The rushing sound that one hears is in fact the noise of the surrounding environment , resonating within the cavity of the shell .
The same effect can be produced with any resonant cavity , such as an empty cup or even by simply cupping one 's hand over one 's ear .
The similarity of the noise produced by the resonator to that of the oceans is due to the resemblance between ocean movements and airflow .
The resonator is simply attenuating some frequencies of the ambient noise in the environment , including air flowing within the resonator and sound originating within the human body itself , more than others .
The human ear picks up sounds made by the human body as well , including the sounds of blood flowing and muscles acting .
These sounds are normally discarded by the brain ; however , they become more obvious when louder external sounds are filtered out .
This occlusion effect occurs with seashells , cups , or hands held over one 's ears , and also with circumaural headphones , whose cups form a seal around the ear , raising the acoustic impedance to external sounds .
