ALL - AMERICAN GIRLS
PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL LEAGUE
The All - American Girls Professional Baseball League ( AAGPBL ) was a professional women 's baseball league founded by Philip K. Wrigley which existed from 1943 to 1954 .
The AAGPBL is the forerunner of women 's professional league sports in the United States .
Over 600 women played in the league , which consisted of eventually 10 teams that were all located in the American Midwest .
In 1948 , league attendance peaked at over 900,000 spectators .
The most successful team , the Rockford Peaches , won a league - best four championships .
The 1992 motion picture A League of Their Own is a mostly fictionalized account of the early days of the league and its stars .
FOUNDING AND PLAY Section::::Founding and play .
With the entry of the United States into World War II , several major league baseball executives started a new professional league with women players in order to maintain baseball in the public eye while the majority of able men were away .
The founders included Philip K. Wrigley , Branch Rickey and Paul V. Harper .
They feared that Major League Baseball might even temporarily cease due to the war because of the loss of talent , as well as restrictions on team travel due to gasoline rationing .
The women 's initial tryouts were held at Wrigley Field in Chicago .
Scouted from amateur softball games across the country , over 200 women were invited to try - out , and about 60 were selected for the league roster .
Like the male major - league , the ' girls ' league was also informally segregated , thus no African Americans were recruited or hired .
Women were selected for their skilled play , but the player also needed to fit what was seen by marketers as a wholesome feminine ideal .
The first league game was played on May 30 , 1943 .
The league went through three periods of ownership .
It was owned by chewing gum mogul , Wrigley from 1943 to 1945 , wealthy publicist Arthur Meyerhoff from 1945 to 1951 , and the teams were individually owned from 1951 to 1954 .
The teams generally played in Midwestern cities .
The South Bend Blue Sox and the Rockford Peaches were the only two teams that stayed in their home cities for the full period of the AAGPBL 's existence .
In the first season , the league played a game that was a hybrid of baseball and softball .
The ball was 12 inches in circumference , the size of a regulation softball ( regulation baseballs are 9 to 9 inches ) .
The pitcher 's mound was only forty feet from home plate , closer even than in regulation softball and much closer than the baseball distance of 60 feet , 6 inches .
Pitchers threw underhand windmill , like in softball , and the distance between bases was 65 feet , five feet longer than in softball but 25 feet shorter than in baseball .
Major similarities between the AAGPBL and baseball included nine player teams and the use of a pitcher 's mound ( softball pitchers throw from flat ground ) .
By 1948 the ball had shrunk to 10 3/8 inches , overhand pitching was allowed , and the mound was moved back to 50 feet .
Over the history of the league , the rules continued to gradually approach those of baseball .
By the final season in 1954 , the ball was regulation baseball size , the mound was moved back to 60 feet , and the basepaths were extended to 85 feet ( still five feet shorter than in regulation baseball ) .
Teams were generally managed by men who knew competitive athletics and were former major league players , in part to demonstrate to fans that the league was serious .
Salaries were above average for women and ranged from $ 45–$85 ( or $ – $ in dollars ) a week during the first years of play to about $ 125 ( or $ in dollars ) per week in later years .
The women 's league generally went along with the men 's late spring to early autumn season .
The uniforms worn by the female ballplayers consisted of a belted , short - sleeved tunic dress with a slight flare of the skirt .
Rules stated that skirts were to be worn no more than six inches above the knee , but the regulation was most often ignored in order to facilitate running and fielding .
A circular team logo was sewn on the front of each dress , and baseball caps featured elastic bands in the back so that they were one - size - fits - all During spring training the girls were required to attend Helena Rubinstein 's evening charm school classes .
The proper etiquette for every situation was taught , and every aspect of personal hygiene , mannerisms and dress code was presented to all the players .
In an effort to make each player as physically attractive as possible , each received a beauty kit and instructions on how to use it .
As a part of the leagues ' Rules of Conduct ' , the ' girls ' were not permitted to have short hair , smoke or drink in public places , and they were required to wear lipstick at all times .
Fines for not following the leagues rules of conduct were five dollars for the first offense , ten for the second , and suspension for the third .
In 1944 , Josephine " JoJo " D'Angelo was fired for cutting her hair short .
The women 's contracts were much stricter about behavior than in the men 's league , and each team was also assigned its own chaperone by the league .
The AAGPBL peaked in attendance during the 1948 season , when 10 teams attracted 910,000 paid fans .
The Rockford Peaches won the most league championships with four ( 1945 , 1948 , 1949 , 1950 ) .
The Milwaukee / Grand Rapids Chicks were second with three ( 1944 in Milwaukee , 1947 and 1953 in Grand Rapids ) .
The Racine Belles ( 1943 and 1946 ) and the South Bend Blue Sox ( 1951 and 1952 ) each won two , and the Kalamazoo Lassies won in the league 's final season ( 1954 ) .
LEGACY Section::::Legacy .
The 1992 film A League of Their Own , although fictionalized , covers the founding and play of this league .
Geena Davis , Lori Petty , Rosie O'Donnell , Madonna , and Tom Hanks were the stars of the film , which was directed by Penny Marshall .
The league is the forerunner of later - day professional league sports played by women .
Lois Siegel documented the All - American Girls Professional Baseball League in her film Baseball Girls , which was produced by the National Film Board of Canada .
Olive Little threw the first no - hitter in team and league history .
Several histories of the AAGPBL have been published in book form .
Although the AAGPBL was the first recorded professional women 's baseball league , women had played baseball since the nineteenth century .
The first known women 's baseball team played at Vassar College in 1866 , while barnstorming Bloomer Girls teams ( sometimes including men ) Baseball Hall of Fame members Max Carey and Jimmie Foxx managed teams in the AAGPBL .
The league went through a series of name changes during its history .
It was founded as the All - American Girls Softball League . , but midway through its first season of 1943 , the name was changed to the All - American Girls Baseball League ( AAGBBL ) .
After the 1943 season , the official League name was again changed , to the All - American Girls Professional Ball League ( AAGPBL ) , reflecting that players were paid from the start and further separate it from existing amateur leagues .
This name was used until the end of the 1945 season , when the league reverted to All - American Girls Baseball League ( AAGBBL ) , which it would use through 1950 .
When teams were sold to independent owners at the end of the 1950 season , the official League name was changed to the American Girls Baseball League ( AGBL ) , although it continued to be popularly identified as the All - American League or the All - American Girls Baseball League ( AAGBBL ) .
When the Players ' Association organized in 1986 , and gained recognition by the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1988 , the name All - American Girls Professional Baseball League ( AAGPBL ) was chosen to represent the league , and that is the name commonly used to refer to it to this day .
RULES OF PLAY UNIFORMS Section::::Uniforms .
The uniform was a one - piece short - skirted flared tunic with a team patch in the center of the chest .
The base uniform was designed by Wrigley Company art director Otis Shepard , who was also the longtime art director for the Chicago Cubs and spearheaded a series of innovative uniforms beginning in 1937 .
Shepard modeled the uniform after the figure skating , field hockey , and tennis outfits of the period .
The uniforms included satin shorts , knee - high baseball socks , and a baseball cap .
The team patches were modeled after each respective city 's seal .
THEME SONG Section::::Theme song .
The theme song made famous in the 1992 film A League of Their Own was the official song of the All - American Girls Baseball League , co - written by Pepper Paire and Nalda Bird ( although in the movie , the word " Irishmen " was changed to " Irish ones " ) .
Victory Song Batter up !
Hear that call !
" The time has come for one and all To play ball .

When the All - American Girls Professional Baseball League was unable to continue in 1955 , its history and its significance was forgotten by Baseball Historians .
Many people in the 1950s thought that women were not supposed to play baseball , so most female athletes competed on other fields of endeavor .
Finally , in 1980 , former pitcher June Peppas launched a newsletter project to get in touch with friends , teammates and opponents , that resulted in the league 's first reunion in Chicago , Illinois in 1982 .
The Players Association was formed after a 1986 Reunion held in Fort Wayne as part of Run , Jane Run a local Women 's Bureau event .
Historian and Baseball card publisher Sharon Roepke ( author of Diamond Gals ) who was circulating a petition to get the Baseball Hall of Fame to recognize the All American Girls Baseball League asked the players at the Reunion to organize to help the effort .
A meeting was held at the South Bend home of Fran Janssen and the Player 's Association was born .
June Peppas was nominated President .
