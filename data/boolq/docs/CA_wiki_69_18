COFFEE BEAN
A coffee bean is a seed of the coffee plant and the source for coffee .
It is the pit inside the red or purple fruit often referred to as a cherry .
Just like ordinary cherries , the coffee fruit is also a so - called stone fruit .
Even though the coffee beans are seeds , they are referred to as " beans " because of their resemblance to true beans .
The fruits – coffee cherries or coffee berries – most commonly contain two stones with their flat sides together .
A small percentage of cherries contain a single seed , instead of the usual two .
This is called a " peaberry " .
The peaberry occurs only between 10 and 15 % of the time , and it is a fairly common ( yet scientifically unproven ) belief that they have more flavour than normal coffee beans .
Like Brazil nuts ( a seed ) and white rice , coffee beans consist mostly of endosperm .
The two most economically important varieties of coffee plant are the Arabica and the Robusta ; ~60 % of the coffee produced worldwide is Arabica and ~40 % is Robusta .
Arabica beans consist of 0.8–1.4 % caffeine and Robusta beans consist of 1.7–4 % caffeine .
As coffee is one of the world 's most widely consumed beverages , coffee beans are a major cash crop and an important export product , counting for over 50 % of some developing nations ' foreign exchange earnings .
HISTORY Section::::History .
According to popular legend , the coffee plant was discovered in Ethiopia by a goatherd named Kaldi .
Significant dates
*
The first coffee plant was found in the mountains of Yemen .
Then by 1500 , it was exported to the rest of the world through the port of Mocha , Yemen .
* First cultivation in India ( Chikmagalur ) – 1600 * First cultivation in Europe ( also first cultivation outside of east Africa / Arabia ) – 1616 * First cultivation in Java – 1699
* First cultivation in Caribbean ( Cuba , Hispaniola ( Haiti and the Dominican Republic ) , Jamaica , Puerto Rico ) – 1715–1730
* First cultivation in South America – 1730
* First cultivation in Dutch East Indies – 1720
* The plants were first introduced in the Americas around 1723 .
* Roasted beans first sold on retail market ( Pittsburgh ) – 1865 * Important spray - drying techniques developed in 1950s Distribution South America is now responsible for about 45 % of the world 's total coffee exports .
Most of this coffee is grown in Brazil .
The United States imports more coffee than any other nation .
The per capita consumption of coffee in the United States in 2011 was 4.24 kg ( 9 lbs ) , and the value of coffee imported exceeded $ 8 billion .
As of 2015 , Americans consumed approximately 400 million cups of coffee per day , making the United States the leading consumer of coffee in the world .
Coffee plants grow within a defined area between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn , termed the bean belt or coffee belt .
ETYMOLOGY Section::::Etymology .
The Oxford English Dictionary suggests that the European languages generally appear to have gotten the name from Turkish kahveh , about 1600 , perhaps through Italian caffè .
Arab qahwah , in Turkish pronounced kahveh , the name of the infusion or beverage ; said by Arab lexicographers to have originally meant " wine " or some type of wine , and to be a derivative of a verb - root qahiya " to have no appetite . "
Another common theory is that the name derives from Kaffa Province , Ethiopia , where the species may have originated .
COFFEE PLANT Section::::Coffee plant .
The coffee tree averages from in height .
As the tree gets older , it branches less and less and bears more leaves and fruits .
Coffee plants are grown in rows several feet apart .
Some farmers plant fruit trees around them or plant the coffee on the sides of hills , because they need specific conditions to flourish .
Ideally , Arabica coffee beans are grown at temperatures between and Robusta at and receive between of rainfall per year .
Heavy rain is needed in the beginning of the season when the fruit is developing and less later in the season as it ripens .
PROCESSING Section::::Processing .
When the fruit is ripe , it is almost always handpicked , using either " selective picking " , where only the ripe fruit is removed , or " strip - picking " , where all of the fruit is removed from a limb all at once .
This selective picking gives the growers reason to give their coffee a certain specification called " operation cherry red " ( OCR ) .
In rare circumstances , the Asian palm civet eats coffee berries and excretes the beans .
These beans are called kopi luwak , and can be processed further into a rare and expensive coffee .
Two methods are primarily used to process coffee berries .
The first , " wet " or " washed " process , has historically usually been carried out in Central America and areas of Africa .
The flesh of the cherries is separated from the seeds and then the seeds are fermented – soaked in water for about two days .
This softens the mucilage which is a sticky pulp residue that is still attached to the seeds .
Then this mucilage is washed off with water .
The " dry processing " method , cheaper and simpler , was historically used for lower - quality beans in Brazil and much of Africa , but now brings a premium when done well .
Twigs and other foreign objects are separated from the berries and the fruit is then spread out in the sun on concrete , bricks or raise beds for 2–3 weeks , turned regularly for even drying .
COMPOSITION Section::::Composition .
The term " green coffee bean " refers to unroasted mature or immature coffee beans .
These have been processed by wet or dry methods for removing the outer pulp and mucilage and have an intact wax layer on the outer surface .
When immature , they are green .
When mature , they have a brown to yellow or reddish color and typically weigh 300 to 330 mg per dried coffee bean .
Nonvolatile and volatile compounds in green coffee beans , such as caffeine , deter many insects and animals from eating them .
Further , both nonvolatile and volatile compounds contribute to the flavor of the coffee bean when it is roasted .
Nonvolatile nitrogenous compounds ( including alkaloids , trigonelline , proteins , and free amino acids ) and carbohydrates are of major importance in producing the full aroma of roasted coffee and for its biological action .
Since the mid 2000s , green coffee extract has been sold as a nutritional supplement and has been clinically studied for its chlorogenic acid content and for its lipolytic and weight - loss properties .
NONVOLATILE ALKALOIDS Section::::Nonvolatile alkaloids .
Caffeine ( 1,3,7-trimethyl - xanthine ) is the alkaloid most present in green and roasted coffee beans .
The content of caffeine is between 1.0 % and 2.5 % by weight of dry green coffee beans .
The content of caffeine does not change during maturation of green coffee beans .
Lower concentrations of theophylline , theobromine , paraxanthine , liberine , and methylliberine can be found .
The concentration of theophylline , an alkaloid noted for its presence in green tea , is reduced during the roasting process , usually about 15 minutes at , whereas the concentrations of most other alkaloids are not changed .
The solubility of caffeine in water increases with temperature and with the addition of chlorogenic acids , citric acid , or tartaric acid , all of which are present in green coffee beans .
For example , of caffeine dissolves in of water at room temperature , and at .
The xanthine alkaloids are odorless , but have a bitter taste in water , which is masked by organic acids present in green coffee , however .
Trigonelline ( N - methyl - nicotinate ) is a derivative of vitamin B that is not as bitter as caffeine .
In green coffee beans , the content is between 0.6 % and 1.0 % .
At a roasting temperature of , 85 % of the trigonelline is degraded to nicotinic acid , leaving small amounts of the unchanged molecule in the roasted beans .
In green coffee beans , trigonelline is synthesized from nicotinic acid ( pyridinium-3-carboxylic acid ) by methylation from methionine , a sulfur - containing amino acid .
Mutagenic activity of trigonelline has been reported .
PROTEINS AND AMINO ACIDS Section::::Proteins and amino acids .
Proteins account for 8 % to 12 % of dried green coffee beans .
A majority of the proteins are of the 11-S storage kind ( alpha – component of 32 kDa , beta – component of 22 kDa ) , most of which are degraded to free amino acids during maturation of green coffee beans .
Further , 11-S storage proteins are degraded to their individual amino acids under roasting temperature , thus are an additional source of bitter components due to generation of Maillard reaction products .
High temperature and oxygen concentration and low pH degrade 11-S storage proteins of green coffee beans to low - molecular - weight peptides and amino acids .
The degradation is accelerated in the presence of organic acids such as chlorogenic acids and their derivatives .
Other proteins include enzymes , such as catalase and polyphenol oxidase , which are important for the maturation of green coffee beans .
Mature coffee contains free amino acids ( 4.0 mg amino acid / g robusta coffee and up to 4.5 mg amino acid / g arabica coffee ) .
In Coffea arabica , alanine is the amino acid with the highest concentration , i.e. 1.2 mg / g , followed by asparagine of 0.66 mg / g , whereas in C. robusta , alanine is present at a concentration of 0.8 mg / g and asparagine at 0.36 mg / g .
The free hydrophobic amino acids in fresh green coffee beans contribute to the unpleasant taste , making it impossible to prepare a desirable beverage with such compounds .
In fresh green coffee from Peru , these concentrations have been determined as : isoleucine 81 mg / kg , leucine 100 mg / kg , valine 93 mg / kg , tyrosine 81 mg / kg , phenylalanine 133 mg / kg .
The concentration of gamma - aminobutyric acid ( a neurotransmitter ) has been determined between 143 mg / kg and 703 mg / kg in green coffee beans from Tanzania .
Roasted coffee beans do not contain any free amino acids ; the amino acids in green coffee beans are degraded under roasting temperature to Maillard products ( reaction products between the aldehyde group of sugar and the alpha - amino group of the amino acids ) .
Further , diketopiperazines , e.g. cyclo(proline - proline ) , cyclo(proline - leucine ) , and cyclo(proline - isoleucine ) , are generated from the corresponding amino acids , and are the major source of the bitter taste of roasted coffee .
The bitter flavor of diketopiperazines is perceptible at around 20 mg / liter of water .
The content of diketopiperazines in espresso is about 20 to 30 mg , which is responsible for its bitterness .
CARBOHYDRATES Section::::Carbohydrates .
Carbohydrates make up about 50 % of the dry weight of green coffee beans .
The carbohydrate fraction of green coffee is dominated by polysaccharides , such as arabinogalactan , galactomannan , and cellulose , contributing to the tasteless flavor of green coffee .
Arabinogalactan makes up to 17 % of dry weight of green coffee beans , with a molecular weight of 90 kDa to 200 kDa .
It is composed of beta-1 - 3-linked galactan main chains , with frequent members of arabinose ( pentose ) and galactose ( hexose ) residues at the side chains comprising immunomodulating properties by stimulating the cellular defense system ( Th-1 response ) of the body .
Mature brown to yellow coffee beans contain fewer residues of galactose and arabinose at the side chain of the polysaccharides , making the green coffee bean more resistant to physical breakdown and less soluble in water .
The molecular weight of the arabinogalactan in coffee is higher than in most other plants , improving the cellular defense system of the digestive tract compared to arabinogalactan with lower molecular weight .
Free monosaccharides are present in mature brown to yellow - green coffee beans .
The free part of monosaccharides contains sucrose ( gluco - fructose ) up to 9000 mg/100 g of arabica green coffee bean , a lower amount in robustas , i.e. 4500 mg/100 g .
In arabica green coffee beans , the content of free glucose was 30 to 38 mg/100 g , free fructose 23 to 30 mg/100 g ; free galactose 35 mg/100 g and mannitol 50 mg/100 g dried coffee beans , respectively .
Mannitol is a powerful scavenger for hydroxyl radicals , which are generated during the peroxidation of lipids in biological membranes .
LIPIDS
Section::::Lipids .
The lipids found in green coffee include : linoleic acid , palmitic acid , oleic acid , stearic acid , arachidic acid , diterpenes , triglycerides , unsaturated long - chain fatty acids , esters , and amides .
The total content of lipids in dried green coffee is between 11.7 and 14
g/100 g. Lipids are present on the surface and in the interior matrix of green coffee beans .
On the surface , they include derivatives of carboxylic acid-5-hydroxytryptamides with an amide bond to fatty acids ( unsaturated C6 to C24 ) making up to 3 % of total lipid content or 1200 to 1400 microgram / g dried green coffee bean .
Such compounds form a wax - like cover on the surface of the coffee bean ( 200 to 300 mg lipids/100 g dried green coffee bean ) protecting the interior matrix against oxidation and insects .
Further , such molecules have antioxidative activity due to their chemical structure .
Lipids of the interior tissue are triglycerides , linoleic acid ( 46 % of total free lipids ) , palmitic acid ( 30 % to 35 % of total free lipids ) , and esters .
Arabica beans have a higher content of lipids ( 13.5 to 17.4 g lipids/100 g dried green coffee beans ) than robustas ( 9.8 to 10.7 g lipids/100 g dried green coffee beans ) .
The content of diterpenes is about 20 % of the lipid fraction .
The diterpenes found in green coffee include cafestol , kahweol and 16-O - methylcafestol .
Some of these diterpenes have been shown in in vitro experiments to protect liver tissue against chemical oxidation .
In coffee oil from green coffee beans the diterpenes are esterified with saturated long chain fatty acids .
NONVOLATILE CHLOROGENIC ACIDS Section::::Nonvolatile chlorogenic acids .
Chlorogenic acids belong to a group of compounds known as phenolic acids , which are antioxidants .
The content of chlorogenic acids in dried green coffee beans of robusta is 65 mg / g and of arabica 140 mg / g , depending on the timing of harvesting .
At roasting temperature , more than 70 % of chlorogenic acids are destroyed , leaving a residue less than 30 mg / g in the roasted coffee bean .
In contrast to green coffee , green tea contains an average of 85 mg / g polyphenols .
These chlorogenic acids could be a valuable , inexpensive source of antioxidants .
Chlorogenic acids are homologous compounds comprising caffeic acid , ferulic acid and 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acid , which are connected by an ester bond to the hydroxyl groups of quinic acid .
The antioxidant capacity of chlorogenic acid is more potent than of ascorbic acid ( vitamin C ) or mannitol , which is a selective hydroxy - radical scavenger .
Chlorogenic acids have a bitter taste in low concentrations such as 50 mg / l water .
At higher concentrations of 1 g / l water , they have a sour taste .
Chlorogenic acids increase the solubility of caffeine and are important modulators of taste .
VOLATILE COMPOUNDS Section::::Volatile compounds .
Volatile compounds of green coffee beans include short - chain fatty acids , aldehydes , and nitrogen - containing aromatic molecules , such as derivatives of pyrazines ( green - herbeaceous - earthy odor ) .
Briefly , such volatile compounds are responsible for the less pleasing odor and taste of green coffee versus roasted coffee .
Commercial success was realized by Starbucks in creating Green Bean Refreshers using a process that primarily isolates the caffeine from the green beans but does not actually use steeped liquid from the beans .
Many consumers experiment with creating green bean " extract " by steeping green coffee beans in hot water .
Often , the recommended times of steeping ( 20 minutes to 1 hour ) extract too much caffeine to provide a pleasant taste .
A steeping time of 12 minutes or under provides a more palatable liquid that can be used as a base for a drink containing more of the nutrients and less caffeine that using just isolated caffeine extract .
The alkaline stock base that results can be paired with acidic or fruity extracts , with or without sweetener , to mask the vegetable - like taste of the extract .
When green coffee beans are roasted , other molecules with the typical pleasant aroma of coffee are generated , which are not present in fresh green coffee .
During roasting , the major part of the unpleasant - tasting volatile compounds are neutralised .
Unfortunately , other important molecules such as antioxidants and vitamins present in green coffee are destroyed .
Volatile compounds with nauseating odor for humans have been identified , including acetic acid ( pungent , unpleasant odor ) , propionic acid ( odor of sour milk , or butter ) , butanoic acid ( odor of rancid butter , present in green coffee with 2 mg/100 g coffee beans ) , pentanoic acid ( unpleasant fruity flavor , present in green coffee at 40 mg/100 g in coffee beans ) , hexanoic acid ( fatty - rancid odor ) , heptanoic acid ( fatty odor ) , octanoic acid ( repulsive oily rancid odor ) ; nonanoic acid ( mild nut - like fatty odor ) ; decanoic acid ( sour repulsive odor ) , and derivatives of such fatty acids – 3-methyl - valeric acid ( sour , green - herbaceous , unpleasant odor ) , acetaldehyde ( pungent - nauseating odor , even when highly diluted , present in dried green coffee beans at concentrations of about 5 mg / kg ) , propanal ( choking effect on respiratory system , penetrating - nauseating ) , butanal ( nauseating effect , present in dried green coffee beans at 2 to 7 mg / kg ) , or pentanal ( very repulsive nauseating effect ) .
