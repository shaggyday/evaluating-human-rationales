MICROSOFT VISIO
Microsoft Visio ( ) ( formerly Microsoft Office Visio ) is a diagramming and vector graphics application and is part of the Microsoft Office family .
The product was first introduced in 1992 , made by the Shapeware Corporation .
It was acquired by Microsoft in 2000 .
FEATURES Section::::Features .
Microsoft made Visio 2013 for Windows available in two editions : Standard and Professional .
The Standard and Professional editions share the same interface , but the Professional edition has additional templates for more advanced diagrams and layouts , as well as capabilities intended to make it easy for users to connect their diagrams to data sources and to display their data graphically .
The Professional edition features three additional diagram types , as well as intelligent rules , validation , and subprocess ( diagram breakdown ) .
Visio Professional is also offered as an additional component of an Office365 subscription .
On 22 September 2015 , Visio 2016 was released alongside Microsoft Office 2016 .
A few new features have been added such as one - step connectivity with Excel data , information rights management ( IRM ) protection for Visio files , modernized shapes for office layout , detailed shapes for site plans , updated shapes for floor plans , modern shapes for home plans , IEEE compliant shapes for electrical diagrams , new range of starter diagrams , and new themes for the Visio interface .
Database modeling in Visio revolves around a Database Model Diagram ( DMD ) .
FILE FORMATS Section::::File formats .
All of the previous versions of Visio used VSD , the proprietary binary - file format .
Visio 2010 added support for the VDX file format , which is a well - documented XML Schema - based ( " DatadiagramML " ) format , but still uses VSD by default .
Visio 2013 drops support for writing VDX files in favor of the new VSDX and VSDM file formats , and uses them by default .
Created based on Open Packaging Conventions ( OPC ) standard ( ISO 29500 , Part 2 ) , a VSDX or VSDM file consists of a group of XML files archived inside a Zip file .
VSDX and VSDM files differ only in that VSDM files may contain macros .
Since these files are susceptible to macro virus infection , the program enforces strict security on them .
While VSD files use LZW - like lossless compression , VDX is not compressed .
Hence , a VDX file typically takes up 3 to 5 times more storage .
VSDX and VSDM files use the same compression as Zip files .
Visio also supports saving files in SVG files , other diagramming files and images .
However , images can not be opened .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Visio began as a standalone product produced by Shapeware Corporation ; version 1.0 shipped in 1992 .
A pre - release , Version 0.92 , was distributed free on a floppy disk along with a Microsoft Windows systems readiness evaluation utility .
In 1995 , Shapeware Corporation changed their name to Visio Corporation to take advantage of market recognition and related product equity .
Microsoft acquired Visio in 2000 , re - branding it as a Microsoft Office application .
Like Microsoft Project , however , it has never been officially included in any of the bundled Office suites ( although it was on the disk for Office 2003 and could be installed if users knew it was there ) .
Microsoft included a Visio for Enterprise Architects edition with some editions of Visual Studio .NET 2003 and Visual Studio 2005 .
Along with Microsoft Visio 2002 Professional , Microsoft introduced Visio Enterprise Network Tools and Visio Network Center .
Visio Enterprise Network Tools was an add - on product that enabled automated network and directory services diagramming .
Visio Network Center was a subscription - based website where users could locate the latest network documentation content and exact - replica network equipment shapes from 500 leading manufacturers .
The former has been discontinued , while the latter 's shape - finding features are now integrated into the program itself .
Visio 2007 was released on November 30 , 2006 .
Microsoft Visio adopted ribbons in its user interface in Visio 2010 .
Microsoft Word , Excel , PowerPoint , Access and Outlook ( to some extents ) had already adopted the ribbon with the release of Microsoft Office 2007 .

There are no Visio versions 7 , 8 , or 9 , because after Microsoft acquired and branded Visio as a Microsoft Office product , the Visio version numbers followed the Office version numbers .
Version 13 was skipped due to triskaidekaphobia .
Section::::Versions .
Visio does not have a Mac OS X version , which has led to the growth of several third party applications which can open and edit Visio files on Mac .
On 7 May 2001 , Microsoft introduced Visio Enterprise Network Tools ( VENT ) , an add - on for Visio 2002 scheduled for release on 1 July 2001 , and Visio Network Center , a subscription - based web service for IT professionals who use Microsoft Visio for computer network diagramming .
VENT was discontinued on 1 July 2002 because of very low customer demand .
