DISNEY VAULT
The " Disney Vault " is the term used by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment for its policy of putting home video releases of Walt Disney Animation Studios 's animated features on moratorium .
Each Disney film is available for purchase for a limited time , after which it is put " in the vault " and not made available in stores for several years until its re - release .
HISTORY Section::::History .
The practice is the modern version of Disney 's practice of re - releasing its animated films in theaters every ten years which began with the reissue of 1937 's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs .
During the 1980s and 1990s , when the home video market was dominated by VHS systems , Disney films would be reissued every ten years ( a time gap equal to that of their theatrical reissues ) .
With the transition to DVD technology , the moratorium period was continued .
Television commercials for Disney home video releases will alert customers that certain films will be placed on moratorium soon , urging them to purchase these films before they " go back into the Disney Vault " , in the words often spoken by voiceover actor Mark Elliot .
Some direct - to - video Disney films , among them Bambi II , have also been released with a pre - established window of availability .
Alice in Wonderland and Dumbo were among the first movies to be released on home video .
They were also among the first Disney films to be released on TV ( chosen to promote Disneyland of which the two films have prominent rides ) .
Disney has kept this " tradition " by having them always released to the public .
It is because of the tradition that Disney has never vaulted these films because they have become so saturated in the market that vaulting it would have been meaningless .
Nonetheless they have been very successful on Home Video , equivalent to that of the Disney Vault movies .
Near the end of the 2000s they were both announced to be released in on Platinum / Diamond edition .
They were only released on a special edition with similar marketing to the Disney Vault movies .
They are currently available on digital and occasionally on certain steaming devices but are hard to find in stores .
Most recently , Disney has released a Blu - ray / Digital Copy Combo Pack of the films but only as a Disney Movie Club exclusive , which was not released to the public .
As of June 2018 , Disney ceased to sell these editions to DMC members , and instead offers the regular Blu - rays as an option .
With the release of the Signature Collection , Disney has released three movies per year instead of two .
As of December 2018 , none of the films have been vaulted .
CONTROLS Section::::Controls .
The Walt Disney Company itself states that this process is done to both control their market and to allow Disney films to be fresh for new generations of young children .
A side - effect of the moratorium process is the fact that videos and DVDs of Disney films placed on moratorium become collectibles , sold in stores and at auction websites such as eBay for sums in excess of their original suggested retail price .
The practice also has made the Disney films a prime target for counterfeit DVD manufacturers .
