MEDULLARY CAVITY
The medullary cavity ( medulla , innermost part ) is the central cavity of bone shafts where red bone marrow and/or yellow bone marrow ( adipose tissue ) is stored ; hence , the medullary cavity is also known as the marrow cavity .
Located in the main shaft of a long bone ( diaphysis ) ( consisting mostly of compact bone ) , the medullary cavity has walls composed of spongy bone ( cancellous bone ) and is lined with a thin , vascular membrane ( endosteum ) .
However , the medullary cavity is the area inside any bone ( long , flat , etc . )
that holds the bone marrow .
This area is involved in the formation of red blood cells and white blood cells , and the calcium supply for bird eggshells .
Intramedullary is a medical term meaning the inside of a bone .
Examples include intramedullary rods used to treat bone fractures in orthopedic surgery and intramedullary tumors occurring in some forms of cancer or benign tumors such as an enchondroma .
