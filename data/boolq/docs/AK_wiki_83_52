PECK
A peck is an imperial and United States customary unit of dry volume , equivalent to 2 dry gallons or 8 dry quarts or 16 dry pints ( 9.09 ( UK ) or 8.81 ( US ) liters ) .
Two pecks make a kenning ( obsolete ) , and four pecks make a bushel .
Although the peck is no longer widely used , some produce , such as apples , is still often sold by the peck .
Despite being referenced in the well - known Peter Piper tongue twister , pickled peppers are so rarely sold by the peck that any association between pickled peppers and the peck unit of measurement is considered humorous in nature .
