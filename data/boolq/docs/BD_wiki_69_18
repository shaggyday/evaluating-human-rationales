LARGE DENOMINATIONS OF UNITED STATES CURRENCY Large denominations of United States currency greater than $ 100 were circulated by the United States Treasury until 1969 .
Since then , U.S. dollar banknotes have only been issued in seven denominations : $ 1 , $ 2 , $ 5 , $ 10 , $ 20 , $ 50 , and $ 100 .
OVERVIEW AND HISTORY Section::::Overview and history .
Large - denomination currency ( i.e. , banknotes with a face value of $ 500 or higher ) had been used in the United States since the late 18th century .
The first $ 500 note was issued by the Province of North Carolina , authorized by legislation dated May 10 , 1780 .
Virginia quickly followed suit and authorized the printing of $ 500 and $ 1,000 notes on October 16 , 1780 and $ 2,000 notes on May 7 , 1781 .
High - denomination treasury notes were issued , for example during the War of 1812 ( $ 1,000 notes authorized by an act dated June 30 , 1812 ) .
During the American Civil War Confederate currency included $ 500 and $ 1,000 notes .
During the federal banknote issuing period ( 1861 to present ) , the earliest high - denomination notes included three - year Interest - bearing notes of $ 500 , $ 1,000 , and $ 5,000 , authorized by Congress on July 17 , 1861 .
In total , 11 different types of U.S. currency were issued in high - denomination notes across nearly 20 different series dates .
The obverse of United States banknotes generally depict either historical figures , allegorical figures symbolizing significant concepts ( e.g. , liberty , justice ) , or a combination of both .
The reverse designs range from abstract scroll - work with ornate denomination identifiers to reproductions of historical art works .
PUBLIC
VERSUS INSTITUTIONAL USE
Section::::Public versus institutional use .
Series 1934 gold certificates ( $ 100 , $ 1,000 , $ 10,000 and $ 100,000 ) were issued after the gold standard was repealed and gold was compulsorily confiscated by order of President Franklin Roosevelt on March 9 , 1933 ( see United States Executive Order 6102 ) .
Thus the series 1934 notes were used only for intragovernmental ( i.e. , Federal Reserve Bank ) transactions and were not issued to the public .
This series was discontinued in 1940 .
The series 1928 gold certificate reverse was printed in black and green .
See history of the United States dollar .
PASSIVE RETIREMENT Section::::Passive retirement .
Although they are still technically legal tender in the United States , high - denomination bills were last printed on December 27 , 1945 , and officially discontinued on July 14 , 1969 , by the Federal Reserve System , due to ' lack of use ' .
The $ 5,000 and $ 10,000 effectively disappeared well before then .
The Federal Reserve began taking high - denomination currency out of circulation ( destroying large bills received by banks ) in 1969 .
, only 336 $ 10,000 bills were known to exist ; 342 remaining $ 5,000 bills ; and 165,372 remaining $ 1,000 bills .
Due to their rarity , collectors will sometimes pay considerably more than the face value of the bills to acquire them .
Some are in museums in other parts of the world .
For the most part , these bills were used by banks and the federal government for large financial transactions .
This was especially true for gold certificates from 1865 to 1934 .
However , for the most part , the introduction of an electronic money system has made large - scale cash transactions obsolete .
When combined with concerns about counterfeiting and the use of cash in unlawful activities such as the illegal drug trade and money laundering , it is unlikely that the U.S. government will reissue large denomination currency in the near future , despite the amount of inflation that has occurred since 1969 ( a $ 100 bill is now worth less , in real terms , than a $ 20 bill was worth in 1969 ) .
According to the U.S. Department of Treasury website , " The present denominations of our currency in production are $ 1 , $ 2 , $ 5 , $ 10 , $ 20 , $ 50 and $ 100 .
The purpose of the United States currency system is to serve the needs of the public and these denominations meet that goal .
Neither the Department of the Treasury nor the Federal Reserve System has any plans to change the denominations in use today . "

POPULAR CULTURE Section::::In
popular culture .
Before they were ' retired ' , host Monty Hall regularly tempted or teased contestants on Let 's Make a Deal with a $ 1,000 bill featuring Grover Cleveland .
Ridiculously high denomination bills are sometimes used in fiction , for example the trillion dollar bill possessed by Montgomery Burns in The Simpsons .
