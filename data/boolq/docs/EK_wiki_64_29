HISTORY OF THE TENNESSEE
TITANS
The Tennessee Titans are the professional American football team based in Nashville , Tennessee .
They are members of the South Division of the American Football Conference ( AFC ) in the National Football League ( NFL ) .
Previously known as the Houston Oilers , the then - Houston , Texas , team began play in 1960 as a charter member of the American Football League .
The Oilers won two AFL championships before joining the NFL as part of the AFL – NFL merger .
In 1999 , the Titans played their most memorable season since joining the NFL , when they made it all the way to Super Bowl XXXIV , but they fell to the Kurt Warner - led St. Louis Rams .
FRANCHISE HISTORY
HOUSTON OILERS ( 1960–1996 ) Section::::Franchise history .
Section::::Houston Oilers ( 1960–1996 ) .
The Titans were originally formed as the Houston Oilers , one of the eight charter members of the American Football League ( AFL ) .
They became a part of the National Football League in 1970 as part of the AFL – NFL merger and have remained a member of the NFL ever since .
They played in Houston through the end of the 1996 season .
They were part of the AFL 's Eastern Division for their first ten years and became part of the American Football Conference upon their joining the NFL .
They were placed in the AFC 's Central Division , which they were part of until 2002 .
TENNESSEE OILERS ERA ( 1997–1998 ) Section::::Tennessee Oilers era ( 1997–1998 ) .
After fan support in Houston collapsed for the 1996 season , the Oilers announced they would be moving to Tennessee for 1997 .
They intended to play at a new stadium in Nashville , but it would not be ready until 1999 .
The largest stadium in Nashville at the time , Vanderbilt Stadium on the campus of Vanderbilt University , seated only 41,000 — a capacity deemed too small for even temporary use .
Vanderbilt was also unwilling to permit alcohol sales .
However , Adams ruled out using the state 's largest stadium , the University of Tennessee 's Neyland Stadium , in Knoxville ; at 102,000 seats , it would have been all but impossible to sell out in time to avoid local blackouts on television .
Ultimately , Adams announced that the renamed Tennessee Oilers would play the next two seasons at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis .
The team would be based in Nashville , commuting to Memphis only for games — essentially sentencing the Oilers to 32 road games for the next two years .
Even though this arrangement was acceptable to the NFL and the Oilers at the time , few people in either Memphis or Nashville were happy about it .
After numerous attempts to get an NFL team over the last three decades , Memphians wanted nothing to do with a team that would be lost in only two years — especially to longtime rival Nashville .
Conversely , Nashvillians showed little inclination to drive over to see " their " team .
At the time , Interstate 40 was in the midst of major reconstruction in the Memphis area , lengthening the normal three - hour drive between Nashville and Memphis to five hours .
In Memphis , attendance was even worse than it had been in the team 's final season in Houston .
The Oilers played before some of the smallest NFL crowds since the 1950s , with none of the first seven games of the season attracting crowds larger than 27,000 ( in a 62,000-seat stadium ) , and with at least two crowds of less than 18,000 .
The few fans there were usually indifferent , and often those that attended were fans of the opposing team .
Attendance was smaller than what the USFL 's Memphis Showboats had drawn and what the XFL 's Memphis Maniax would draw to the same stadium .
It appeared that only large contingents of fans supporting the Oilers ' opponents kept average attendance from dropping below what it had been for the CFL 's Memphis Mad Dogs .
Despite this , Adams had every intention of playing in Memphis the next season .
That changed after the final game of the 1997 season .
The Oilers faced the Pittsburgh Steelers in front of 50,677 fans — the only crowd that could not have been reasonably accommodated at Vanderbilt .
However , Steeler fans made up the great majority of the crowd ( at least three - fourths , by one estimate ) .
Adams was so embarrassed that he abandoned plans to play the 1998 season in Memphis and ended up playing at Vanderbilt after all .
The team rebounded that season , and was in playoff contention until losing their last two games for another 8–8 record .
The Oilers had gone 6 - 2 in Memphis while going 2 - 6 on the road .
The Titans have maintained both radio and preseason TV affiliates in the Memphis area .
TENNESSEE TITANS ERA ( 1999–PRESENT )
NAME CHANGE
Section::::Tennessee Titans era ( 1999–present ) .
Section::::Name change .
On July 29 , 1998 , Adams announced that in response to fan requests , he was changing the Oilers ' name to coincide with the opening of their new stadium and to better connect with Nashville .
He also declared that the renamed team would retain the Oilers ' heritage ( including team records ) , as had all other relocated teams except the Browns / Ravens , and that there would be a Hall of Fame honoring the greatest players from both eras .
Adams appointed an advisory committee to decide on a new name .
He let it be known that the new name should reflect power , strength , leadership and other heroic qualities .
On November 14 , 1998 , Adams announced that the Oilers would be known as the Tennessee Titans starting in 1999 .
The new name met all of Adams ' requirements , and also served as a nod to Nashville 's nickname of " The Athens of the South " ( for its large number of higher - learning institutions , Classical architecture , and its full - scale replica of the Parthenon ) .
The team 's new logo and colors were unveiled on December 22 , 1998 .
1999
SUPER BOWL RUN Section::::1999
Super Bowl run .
In 1999 , Adelphia Coliseum , now known as Nissan Stadium , was completed and the newly christened Titans had a grand season , finishing with a 13–3 record — the best season in franchise history .
They won their first game as the " Titans " , defeating the Bengals before a sold out stadium ( Every game since the Titans moved to Nashville has been sold out ) .
They did not lose a game at home and finished one game behind the Jacksonville Jaguars for the AFC Central title .
Tennessee then won their first round playoff game over the Buffalo Bills on a designed play , known as " Home Run Throwback " in the Titans playbook , that is commonly referred to as the " Music City Miracle " :
Tight - end Frank Wycheck made a lateral pass to Kevin Dyson on a kickoff return with 16 seconds left in the game and the Titans trailing by one point ; Dyson returned the pass 75 yards for a touchdown to win the game .
After replay review , the call on the field was upheld as a touchdown .
The original play did not call for Dyson to be on the field and he was only involved due to an injury of another player .
The Titans went on to defeat the Indianapolis Colts in Indianapolis , and then defeated the Jaguars in Jacksonville in the AFC Championship Game .
The Titans ' magnificent season led to a trip to Super Bowl XXXIV , where they lost to the St. Louis Rams when Kevin Dyson was tackled one yard short of the end zone ( preserving a 23 - 16 Rams ' lead ) as regulation time expired , in a play known as " The Tackle " .
2000–2009
Section::::2000–2009 .
In 2000 , the Titans finished with an NFL - best 13–3 record and won their third AFC Central title — their first division title as the Tennessee Titans .
They won Central division titles in ' 91 and ' 93 while still in Houston as the Oilers .
The Titans went on to lose their home Divisional playoff game to the eventual Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens .
In 2001 , the Titans collapsed to a 7 - 9 record and missed the playoffs .
In 2002 , the Titans were moved to the newly created AFC South division as a part of the league 's divisional realignment caused by the addition of the Houston Texans .
Despite starting the season 1–4
the Titans finished the season 11 - 5 and made it to the AFC Championship Game but lost to Oakland 41 - 24 .
The Titans went 12 - 4 and made the 2003 playoffs , winning their wild card game over the Baltimore Ravens and losing in the AFC divisionals to the New England Patriots who went on to win the Super Bowl .
In 2003 , quarterback Steve McNair won the MVP award , sharing it with Peyton Manning .
The 2004 season created an unusual number of injuries to key players for the Titans and a 5–11 record .
Their 5–11 record turned out to be their third - worst record ever since the Houston / Tennessee Oilers became the Tennessee Titans .
Numerous key players were cut or traded by the Titans front office during the off season , including Derrick Mason , Samari Rolle , Kevin Carter , and others .
This was done due to the Titans being well over the salary cap .
In 2005 , the Titans took the field with the youngest team in the NFL .
Several rookies made the 2005 team including first round pick , cornerback Adam " Pacman " Jones , offensive tackle Michael Roos , and three wide receivers , Brandon Jones , Courtney Roby , and Roydell Williams .
After losing their first game of the season on the road to the Pittsburgh Steelers 34–7 and then winning their Week 2 home - opener against the Baltimore Ravens 25–10 , the Titans began the season 1–1 , but quickly fell out of contention .
They lost on the road to the St. Louis Rams 31–27 and lost to their division rival , the Colts 31–10 .
After getting some redemption on the road against their new division rival , the Houston Texans 34–20 , they lost five - straight games to the Cincinnati Bengals ( 31–23 ) , the Arizona Cardinals ( 20–10 ) , the Oakland Raiders ( 34–25 ) , the Cleveland Browns ( 20–14 ) , and then ( coming off of their Week 10 bye ) , their division rival , the Jacksonville Jaguars 31–28 .
The Titans won at home against the San Francisco 49ers 33–22 , but then went on the road and were swept by the Colts 35–3 .
The Titans defeated the luckless Texans 13–10 at home , but that was their last win of the year , as they lost their remaining three games to the Seattle Seahawks ( 28–24 ) , the Miami Dolphins ( 24–10 ) , and the Jacksonville Jaguars ( 40–13 ) .
Their record for the season was 4–12 .
In 2006 , The team finished at 8–8 , a definite improvement over the previous year 's mark of 4–12 .
The year saw Vince Young lead the team to an 8–5 record as the starting quarterback .
That span also included six straight victories .
The team 's chances of making the postseason at 9–7 ended at the hands of New England in a 40–23 defeat .
Floyd Reese resigned as the franchise 's Executive Vice President / General Manager on January 5 , 2007 after thirteen seasons at the helm .
He was replaced by Mike Reinfeldt on February 12 of the same year .
After starting a promising 6–2 , the Titans lost four of their next five games to fall to 7–6 .
They then won their next three games including a must - win game against the Indianapolis Colts .
They were tied for the final playoff spot with the Cleveland Browns , but they won the tiebreaker and made the playoffs at 10–6 .
In the wild card round they lost to the San Diego Chargers , 17–6 .
The year began with the Titans selecting Chris Johnson out of East Carolina University in the first round of the NFL draft , and subsequently acquired former Titan ( most recently Eagle )
DE Jevon Kearse and former Falcons TE Alge Crumpler .
After a Week 1 injury to Vince Young , Kerry Collins took over the starting quarterback position and led the Titans to a 10 - 0 record before their first defeat at the hands of the New York Jets on November 23 .
The Titans followed up the 34 - 13 loss by defeating the winless Lions on Thanksgiving by a score of 47–10 .
In week 14 , Tennessee clinched its second AFC South title with a 28 - 9 victory over the Cleveland Browns .
In the week 14 game against the Browns , rookie Chris Johnson rushed 19 times for 136 yards and one touchdown and LenDale White rushed for 99 yards and one touchdown .
They later clinched a first round playoff bye with a loss of the New York Jets .
On December 21 , 2008 , the Titans played the Pittsburgh Steelers in a contest to decide the number one seed in the AFC .
The Titans won 31 - 14 and clinched home field advantage throughout the playoffs .
Their final record was 13–3 , which ties their franchise record for most wins .
On Saturday , January 10 , they lost their home playoff game 13–10 to the Baltimore Ravens , who had previously won their Wildcard game at Miami on January 4 .
The playoff game against Baltimore included three red zone turnovers and 12 penalties by the Titans .
After their successful 2008 season , the Titans looked to be very promising in 2009 .
However , the opening game against Pittsburgh resulted in a 13 - 10 overtime loss and things disintegrated from there as they dropped the next five matches .
This losing streak culminated in a catastrophic 59 - 0 defeat at the hands of New England .
After the bye week , it was decided that Vince Young would succeed Kerry Collins as the starting quarterback .
The team began recovering and won five in a row including a game against the defending NFC Champion Arizona Cardinals , on a 99-yard game - winning drive by Vince Young , culminating in a touchdown pass on fourth down with 6 seconds left from the 10-yard line to Kenny Britt .
During the Week 10 home game against Buffalo , Bud Adams was seen making an obscene gesture towards the Bills bench , and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell ( who was also attending the game ) fined him $ 250,000 .
Afterwards , the Titans sustained a defeat against Indianapolis , wins over St. Louis and Miami , a loss to San Diego , and finally a victory in Seattle to end the season at 8 - 8 .
Not only did the Tennessee Titans have a great 8 - 2 finish , but along the way , running back Chris Johnson became only the sixth player in NFL history to rush for over 2,000 yards ( 2,006 ) , surpassing Marshall Faulk 's record for the most yards from scrimmage during a season with over 2,500 total yards .
2010–PRESENT
Section::::2010–present .
The Titans started 2010 with alternating wins and losses .
They crushed Oakland at home in Week 1 and then were beaten 19 - 11 by the Steelers in Week 2 .
In Week 3 , Tennessee beat the Giants 29 - 10 in the New Meadowlands .
In week 4 , Tennessee lost 26 - 20 to Denver , and finally won 34 - 27 in Dallas to reach a 3 - 2 record by Week 5 .
The following game was a MNF rout of Jacksonville ( 30 - 3 ) .
In Week 7 , they beat Philadelphia 37 - 19 in a come - from- behind win that included scoring 27 points in the fourth quarter .
Wide receiver Kenny Britt had a break out performance with 225 reception yards , 3 touchdowns , and 7 receptions .
However , after a loss to the Chargers in Week 8 , they were the only team to submit in a claim for the recently waived Randy Moss .
Even after this widely publicized claim , the team was still unable to beat the Dolphins after their bye week , 29 - 17 .
In Week 11 , at home against the Washington Redskins , the Titans lost Young to a thumb injury in - game and they snapped their NFL - leading interconference win streak at 14 games , losing to Washington 19 - 16 in overtime .
After the game , Young had a highly publicized meltdown in the locker room and walked out on Fisher , causing him to not only be promptly put on injured reserve , but also essentially guaranteeing his release from the team in the offseason .
Losses continued to mount for the Titans , until a week 15 win against the Houston Texans kept their season alive at 6 - 8 .
Needing a miracle to get into the playoffs , this nonetheless happened with consequent losses against the Chiefs and Colts .
The Titans ' season ended at 6 - 10 .
In the week following the Titans ' final loss to the Colts , the generally pro - Young Bud Adams agreed that it would be best for the team to release or trade Young .
On January 7 , 2011 Adams released a statement announcing he was retaining head coach Jeff Fisher , as Fisher was under contract for the next season .
Adams also stated that he hoped to extend Fisher 's contract following the 2011 season , but that an extension would be contingent upon the team 's performance .
Despite these initial proclamations , it was announced on January 27 , 2011 that Fisher and the Titans had mutually agreed to part ways .
This ended Fisher 's tenure as Head Coach , a tenure which lasted more than 17 seasons , spanned three cities ( Houston , Memphis , and Nashville ) , and saw three different incarnations of the team ( Houston Oilers , Tennessee Oilers , Tennessee Titans ) .
Following the departure of former head coach Jeff Fisher , Mike Munchak was named head coach of the Titans on February 7 , 2011 .
During the 2011 NFL Draft the Titans took Washington QB Jake Locker with the 8th pick overall .
Meanwhile , 15-year veteran Kerry Collins retired from the NFL in July ( unretiring a month later to join the Indianapolis Colts ) .
On July 29 , 2011 veteran
Seahawks QB Matt Hasselbeck signed a 3-year , $ 21 million deal to play for the Tennessee Titans .
During the summer training camp prior to the 2011 season , Chris Johnson did not show up to camp , pending contract negotiations .
Johnson felt he was due a considerably larger sum of money .
As the leading rusher since 2008 ( 4,598 yards )
he was set to make $ 1.065 million in 2011 , under current contract terms .
On September 1 , Johnson became the highest paid running back , agreeing to a four - year , $ 53.5 million contract extension , including $ 30 million guaranteed , with the Titans , ending his holdout .
With Hasselbeck starting , the Titans won three of their first four games , but afterwards saw a bumpy series of wins and losses .
They finally finished the season 9 - 7 , failing again to reach the playoffs , but remaining in contention to Week 17 .
