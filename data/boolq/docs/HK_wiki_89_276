LIST OF FIFA WORLD CUP PENALTY SHOOT - OUTS
This is a list of all penalty shoot - outs that have occurred in the Finals tournament of the FIFA World Cup .
Penalty shoot - outs were introduced as tie - breakers in the 1978 World Cup but did not occur before 1982 .
The first time a World Cup title was won by penalty shoot - out was in 1994 .
The only other time was in 2006 .
By the end of the 2018 edition , 30 shoot - outs have taken place in the World Cup .
Of these , only two reached the sudden death stage after still being tied at the end of " best of five kicks " .
The first editions of the World Cup used the rule of replaying a knockout game ending in a tie .
Replacement of the rule of deciding a winner of a drawn game via drawing of lots was first proposed in 1970 to International Football Association Board , and it was adopted by FIFA for the World Cup for the first time at the 1978 tournament .
