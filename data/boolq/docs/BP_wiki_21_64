BISECTS AND SPLITS Bisects and splits refer to postage stamps that have been cut in part , most commonly in half , but also other fractions , and postally used for the proportionate value of the entire stamp , such as a two cent stamp cut in half and used as a one cent stamp .
When stocks of a certain stamp ran out , postmasters sometimes resorted to cutting higher denominated stamps in half , vertically or diagonally , thus obtaining two " stamps " each representing half of the original monetary value , or " face " value , of the uncut stamp .
The general public also resorted to this practice , sometimes pursuant to official or tacit permission and sometimes without any express authorization .
Many of these instances have been well documented in postal history .
One example is the bisects of the Island of Guernsey during the German military occupation of the Channel Islands during World War II .
Early Mexican stamps are known to have been used cut in half , three - quarters , quarters and even eighths .
Many bisects and splits are considerably more valuable than the stamps from which they were made .
These , however , only have philatelic value when the cut portion is still affixed to the envelope or a piece showing the postmarks , as otherwise it can not be confirmed that the stamp was in fact postally used as a split and not simply a complete stamp that was cut up after use .
