LAS VEGAS , NEW MEXICO Las Vegas is a city in and the county seat of San Miguel County , New Mexico , United States .
Once two separate municipalities ( one a city and the other a town ) , both were named Las Vegas —
West Las Vegas ( " Old Town " ) and East Las Vegas ( " New Town")—are separated by the Gallinas River and retain distinct characters and separate , rival school districts .
The population was 14,565 at the 2000 census .
Las Vegas , NM is located south of Raton , New Mexico , east of Santa Fe , New Mexico , northeast of Albuquerque , New Mexico , south of Colorado Springs , Colorado , and south of Denver , Colorado . HISTORY Section::::History .
Las Vegas was established in 1835 after a group of settlers received a land grant from the Mexican government .
The town was laid out in the traditional Spanish Colonial style , with a central plaza surrounded by buildings which could serve as fortifications in case of attack .
Las Vegas soon prospered as a stop on the Santa Fe Trail .
During the Mexican – American War in 1846 , Stephen W. Kearny delivered an address at the Plaza of Las Vegas claiming New Mexico for the United States .
In 1877 Las Vegas College , the precursor to Regis University , was founded in Las Vegas by a group of exiled Italian Jesuits .
In 1887 , Las Vegas College moved to Denver whereupon the name was changed .
A railroad was constructed to the town in 1880 .
To maintain control of development rights , it established a station and related development one mile ( 1.6 km )
east of the Plaza , creating a separate , rival New Town , as occurred elsewhere in the Old West .
The same competing development occurred in Albuquerque , for instance .
During the railroad era Las Vegas boomed , quickly becoming one of the largest cities in the American Southwest .
Turn - of - the - century
Las Vegas featured all the modern amenities , including an electric street railway , the " Duncan Opera House " at the northeast corner of 6th Street and Douglas Avenue , a Carnegie library , the Hotel Castaneda ( a major Harvey House ) , and the New Mexico Normal School ( now New Mexico Highlands University ) .
Since the decline and restructuring of the railroad industry began in the 1950s , the city 's population has remained relatively constant .
Although the two towns have been combined , separate school districts have been maintained ( Las Vegas City Schools and West Las Vegas School District ) .
The anti - colonist organization Las Gorras Blancas was active in the area in the 1890s .

The reunion was attended by the then Governor of New York , Theodore Roosevelt .
Two years later , in 1901 , Theodore Roosevelt became the 26th President of the United States when President William McKinley died while Roosevelt was serving as vice - president .
The last surviving Rough Rider , Jesse Langdon , died in 1975 at the age of 94 .
In 2005 , a group of local motorcycle riders gathered to organize and hold a rally focused on the area 's history and special environment .

These reunions were organized by a group of ranching families and cowboys which soon became the Las Vegas Cowboys ' Reunion Association .
The Reunions celebrated ranching life , which began in northern New Mexico in the early 1800s and continues into the 21st Century .
The annual affair included pie eating contests , barbecues , parades , banquets , balls , and " ranch rodeos . "
In the early years , celebrities — cowhands as well as big - name bands , movie stars like Tom Mix , and artists such as Randall Davey — came to Las Vegas for this event .
In later years , famous cowhands participated in the Cowboys ' Reunion Rodeos .
The Cowboys ' Reunions reflected the occupations of the area and attracted huge crowds for their 4 days of events .
