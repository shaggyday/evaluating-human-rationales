HISTORY Section::::History .
In 1963 , the F.W. Woolworth Company purchased the Kinney Shoe Corporation and operated it as a subsidiary .
In the 1960s , Kinney branched into specialty shoe stores , including Stylco in 1967 , Susie Casuals in 1968 , and Foot Locker on September 12 , 1974 .
The first Foot Locker opened in the Puente Hills Mall in the City of Industry , California and still is open today .
Woolworth also diversified its portfolio of specialty stores in the 1980s , including Afterthoughts , Northern Reflections , Rx Place , and Champs Sports .
By 1989 , the company was pursuing an aggressive strategy of multiple specialty store formats targeted at enclosed shopping malls .
The idea was that if a particular concept failed at a given mall , the company could quickly replace it with a different concept .
The company aimed for 10 stores in each of the country 's major shopping malls , but this never came to pass as Woolworth never developed that many successful specialty store formats .
In 1988 , the F.W. Woolworth Company incorporated a separate company called the Woolworth Corporation in the state of New York .
The Woolworth Corporation was responsible for the operations of the Foot Locker stores , among the other specialty chains operated by Woolworth 's .
One of its first moves was the acquisition of Champs Sports and to rename itself the Woolworth Athletic Group .
During the 1980s and 1990s , the F.W. Woolworth Company 's flagship department store chain fell into decline , ultimately culminating in the closure of the last stores operating under the name of Woolworth 's in the United States in 1997 .
Deciding to continue aggressive expansion into the athletic business in the following years , the company acquired Eastbay in 1997 , which was the largest athletic catalog retailer in the United States , as well as subsequent purchases of regional storefront retailers Sporting Goods ( purchased in 1997 ) and The Athletic Fitters ( purchased in 1998 ) .

On February 12 , 1999 , a federal jury in Austin awarded $ 341,000 Thursday to a former Foot Locker shoe store manager who said the company systematically discriminated against its African American employees by offering more opportunities for promotions to white managers .
As the " Foot Locker " brand had become the Woolworth / Venator company 's top performing line , on November 2 , 2001 Venator changed its name to Foot Locker ,
Inc. On November 19 , 2004 , Foot Locker announced that its quarterly profit rose 19 percent , helped by stronger sales .
