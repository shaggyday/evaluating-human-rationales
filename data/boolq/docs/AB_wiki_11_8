DILATION AND CURETTAGE Dilation ( or dilatation ) and curettage ( D&C ) refers to the dilation ( widening / opening ) of the cervix and surgical removal of part of the lining of the uterus and/or contents of the uterus by scraping and scooping ( curettage ) .
It is a therapeutic gynecological procedure as well as the most often used method of first trimester miscarriage or abortion .
D&C normally refers to a procedure involving a curette , also called sharp curettage .
However , some sources use the term D&C to refer more generally to any procedure that involves the processes of dilation and removal of uterine contents , which includes the more common suction curettage procedures of manual and electric vacuum aspiration .
PROCEDURE
Section::::Procedure .
The woman is typically put under monitored anesthesia care ( MAC ) before the procedure begins .
The first step in a D&C is to dilate the cervix .
This can be done with Hegar dilators .
A curette , a metal rod with a handle on one end and a sharp loop on the other , is then inserted into the uterus through the dilated cervix .
The curette is used to gently scrape the lining of the uterus and remove the tissue in the uterus .
This tissue is examined for completeness ( in the case of abortion or miscarriage treatment ) or by pathology for abnormalities ( in the case of treatment for abnormal bleeding ) .
CLINICAL USES
Section::::Clinical uses .
D&Cs are commonly performed for the diagnosis of gynecological conditions leading to ' abnormal uterine bleeding ' ; to resolve abnormal uterine bleeding ( too much , too often or too heavy a menstrual flow ) ; to remove the excess uterine lining in women who have conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome ( which cause a prolonged buildup of tissue with no natural period to remove it ) ; to remove tissue in the uterus that may be causing abnormal vaginal bleeding , including postpartum retained placenta ; to remove retained tissue ( also known as retained POC or retained products of conception ) in the case of a missed or incomplete miscarriage ( in which some of the tissue remains in the uterus and the cervix stays open .
This may increase a woman 's risk of infection and continued bleeding ) ; and as a method of abortion .
In contrast , D&C remains ' standard care ' for missed and incomplete miscarriage in many countries despite the existence of alternatives currently used for abortions .
Because medicinal and non - invasive methods of abortion now exist , and because D&C requires heavy sedation or general anesthesia and has higher risks of complication , the procedure has been declining as a method of abortion .
The World Health Organization recommends D&C as a method of surgical abortion only when manual vacuum aspiration is unavailable .
Most D&Cs are now carried out for miscarriage management and other indications such as diagnosis .
Hysteroscopy is a valid alternative to D&C for many surgical indications from diagnosis of uterine pathology to the removal of fibroids and even retained products of conception .
It poses less risk because the doctor has a view inside the uterus during surgery , unlike with blind D&C. Medical management of miscarriage and medical abortion using drugs such as misoprostol and mifepristone are safe , non - invasive and cheaper alternatives to D&C. COMPLICATIONS Section::::Complications .
Complications may arise from either the introduction or spreading of infection , adverse reaction to general anesthesia required during the surgery or from instrumentation itself , if the procedure is performed blindly ( without the use of any imaging technique such as ultrasound or hysteroscopy ) .
One risk of sharp curettage is uterine perforation .
Although normally no treatment is required for uterine perforation , a laparoscopy may be done to verify that bleeding has stopped on its own .
Infection of the uterus or fallopian tubes is also a possible complication , especially if the woman has an untreated sexually transmitted infection .
Another risk is intrauterine adhesions , or Asherman 's syndrome .
One study found that in women who had one or two sharp curettage procedures for miscarriage , 14 - 16 % developed some adhesions .
Women who underwent three sharp curettage procedures for miscarriage had a 32 % risk of developing adhesions .
The risk of Asherman 's syndrome was found to be 30.9 % in women who had D&C following a missed miscarriage , and 25 % in those who had a D&C 1â€“4 weeks postpartum .
Untreated Asherman 's syndrome , especially if severe , also increases the risk of complications in future pregnancies , such as ectopic pregnancy , miscarriage , and abnormal placentation ( e.g.placenta previa and placenta accreta ) .
According to recent case reports , use of vacuum aspiration can also lead to intrauterine adhesions .
Yet , in terms of long - term reproductive outcome after miscarriage , a review in 2013 came to the conclusion that there were no studies reporting a link to D&C , while similar pregnancy outcomes were reported subsequent to surgical management ( including D&C ) , medical management or conservative management ( that is , watchful waiting ) .
After miscarriage , there is an association between surgical intervention in the uterus and the development of intrauterine adhesions , and between intrauterine adhesions and adverse pregnancy outcomes , but there is still no clear evidence of any method of prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes related to intrauterine adhesions .
