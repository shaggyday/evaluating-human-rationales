HISTORY TERRITORY OF THE QUILEUTE INDIANS Section::::Territory of the Quileute Indians .
Forks was once inhabited by the Quileute before they ceded their territory .
In 1889 a reservation was created near Forks the same year that Washington became a state .
That same year the village was burnt down by settler Daniel Pullen .
Forks is 12 miles from tribal burning areas that area tribes used to regenerate young ferns .
The phrase " prairie upstream " from Quileute language was translated and became the name Forks Prairie .
EARLY SETTLEMENT Section::::Early settlement .
Early settlers to Forks came via the rivers and trails from the Pacific and the Strait of Juan de Fuca due to the lack of overland options .
In the 1860s , Men from Dungeness unsuccessfully attempted to convince the territorial legislature to create Quillayute County out of Clallam and Jefferson counties 's western ends .
In January 1878 in a mile east of Forks , Luther and Esther Ford arrived and laid claim to the 160-acre homestead ( at the time there was already a few trappers living in the area ) .
Ford set up the first dairy herd in the settlement in 1879 .
In 1884 a post office opened in Nelson 's cabin .
Since another Washington settlement already was named ' Ford 's Prairie ' the name ' Forks ' was chosen as the name .
The name ' Forks ' was due to the prairie 's location as a fork in the vicinity of three rivers .
It was difficult to receive and sell products in Forks in its early days since the nearest market was in Port Townsend ( over 55 miles away ) .
The small supply boat that was provided in the summers was n't large enough for cargo either .
Due to these problems , hops would regular rot awaiting transport .
It was n't until narrow roads were built in the 1880s and 1890s that the situation improved slightly .
Eventually canoes and ferries were used to help alleviate these issues .
In 1927 a single car sized road opened from Lake Crescent to Forks and the Olympic Loop Highway ( U.S. 101 ) was built through Forks in 1931 .
The Mora post moved to Forks in the early 1890s which consisted of a general store , hardware store , and a hotel .
In the early 1900s , hop growing declined and the Forks Cooperative Creamery was established which operated for 70 years .
Timber was cleared by settlers and small time loggers in the late 1800s .
Booming logging camps were set up by Timber baron Michael Earles in the early 1900s which attracted a lot of workers in the area .
In 1916 , Merrill & Ring began to log in the Pysht River drainage northwest of the area .
President Grover Cleveland placed individual claiming of timber volume off limits in the Olympic Peninsula around this time which proved monumental for the area 's future .
The Olympic Forest Reserve was trimmed by 623,000 acres but it contained three - fourths of all timber by volume .
The Olympic National Park took up the remaining parts of the reserve
( it first became a monument in 1909 ) .
Isolation soon creeped into the area due to the 1907 national recession .
Sitka Spruce in the West End was provided during World War I due to urgent demand .
The U.S. Army 's Spruce Production Division used this spruce to build 36 miles of railroad track from Port Angeles to Lake Pleasant in six months .
But before it could be completed , World War
I ended and no spruce was hauled down the line .
Settlers from the Hoh came gradually to Forks in its earlier days .
In 1912 the town was laid out where the Whittier homestead stood and as late as the 1920s
the town was just a block of buildings and prairie homesteads amongst looming forests .
In 1930 the current newspaper , Forks Forum started publication 40 years after the original Forks newspaper was established .
Throughout the 1920s and 1930s , Forks gained many amenities of modern towns at the time as new inhabitants increased its population .
Nearly 20 percent of the forest around Forks was flattened as what locals described as a " hurricane roaring overhead " swept through the West End .
Five years later a fire occurred on Main Street before another fire hit the town in 1951 .
MODERN HISTORY Section::::Modern history .
Forks was officially incorporated on August 28 , 1945 , following an election of the constituents who would become its first town members .
