MEMBER STATES OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS Between 1920 and 1939 , a total of 63 countries became member states of the League of Nations .
The Covenant forming the League of Nations was included in the Treaty of Versailles and came into force on 10 January 1920 .
The League of Nations was dissolved on 18 April 1946 , when its assets and responsibilities were transferred to the United Nations .
The League 's greatest extent was from 28 September 1934 ( when Ecuador joined ) to 23 February 1935 ( when Paraguay withdrew ) with 58 members .
At this time , only Costa Rica ( 22 January 1925 ) , Brazil ( 14 June 1926 ) , Japan ( 27 March 1933 ) and Germany ( 19 September 1933 ) had withdrawn and only Egypt was left to join ( on 26 May 1937 ) .

A further 21 countries joined between 1920 and 1937 , but 7 left , withdrew or were expelled before 1946 .

The word " withdrew " indicates that a country left of its own choice .
The word " left " indicates a country that ceased to exist because of annexation by Germany , Italy or the Soviet Union .
The Soviet Union was the only country to be expelled by the League ( in 1939 , following its invasion of Finland ) .
