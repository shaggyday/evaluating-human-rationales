BACHELOR OF GENERAL STUDIES
A Bachelor of General Studies ( BGS ) is an undergraduate degree offered by many colleges and universities in the Western world .
The history of the general studies concept is coeval with that of the medieval European university ( where it existed under the formal Latin designation Studium generale ) .
The BGS offers students the ability to design a unique degree plan while meeting their academic institution 's general requirements .
This flexibility allows students to complete a bachelor 's degree that offers an element of individualism absent in many other degrees specific to a particular discipline .
A BGS holds the same value as other degrees in liberal arts or sciences and is often referred to as an " interdisciplinary " degree , which allows students to build strong arguments based on information from a broad range of topics .
In the United States , hundreds of colleges and universities offer BGS programs .
Students typically can choose from concentrations in a variety of areas .
Examples include University of Michigan , Western Illinois University , University of Connecticut , University of Miami , California University of Management and Technology ( CALMAT ) , University of Nebraska at Omaha , William Carey University , and Charter Oak State College , which offers a BGS degree with a wide variety of concentration options .
Regent University is one of few Christian universities to offer a general studies degree .
Despite its name , Columbia University School of General Studies does not offer a Bachelor of General Studies .
