BETWEEN SHADES OF GRAY Between Shades of Gray , a New York Times Best Seller , is the debut novel of American novelist Ruta Sepetys .
It follows the Stalinist repressions of the mid-20th century and follows the life of Lina as she is deported from her native Lithuania with her mother and younger brother , and the journey they take to a labor camp in Siberia .
It was nominated for the 2012 CILIP Carnegie Medal and has been translated into more than 27 languages .
Between Shades of Gray was originally intended as a young adult novel , but there have been several adult publications .
In an interview with ThirstforFiction , Ruta Sepetys said that the reason she intended Between Shades of Gray to be a young adult novel was because she met many survivors in Lithuania who were themselves teenagers during the deportations and had a greater will to live than many of their adult counterparts at the time .
INSPIRATION AND BASIS Section::::Inspiration and basis .
Between Shades of Gray is partly based upon the stories Sepetys heard from survivors of the genocide of Baltic people during a visit to her relatives in Lithuania .
Sepetys decided she needed to write a fiction novel rather than a non - fiction volume as a way of making it easier for survivors to talk to her .
She interviewed dozens of people during her stay .
SYNOPSIS
Section::::Synopsis .
Lina Vilkas is introduced as a young artist living comfortably in her home in Kaunas , Lithuania , with her loving family .
But , on June 14 , 1941 , Soviet officers ( the NKVD ) barge into her home , tearing her family from the comfortable life they 've known .
Separated from her father , forced onto a crowded and dirty train car , Lina , along with her mother and her younger brother , Jonas , slowly make their way north to a work camp in the coldest reaches of Siberia .
Here they are forced , under Stalin 's orders , to dig for beets and fight for their lives under the cruelest of conditions .
Lina befriends many people and works hard alongside her mother and brother for food and survival .
Upon arriving at the camp , Lina and her family are forced to live with Ulyushka , a cruel , seemingly heartless woman who initially dislikes the Vilkas ' and constantly takes their food and other goods from them as a form of rent .
Elena Vilkas , Lina 's mother , is kind and generous to Ulyushka , though Lina and her brother Jonas can not understand why .
Lina befriends a fellow Lithuanian deportee , Andrius Arvydas ( who later becomes her love interest ) , Mr. Stalas ( referred to as the Bald Man , who is secretly Jewish and adds a touch of humor because of his terrible advice and short temper ) , Mrs. Grybas , Mrs. Rimas , and Alexandras Lukas , who is gray - haired and was once a lawyer .
He is often seen winding his watch and is the voice and soul of reason .
One NKVD member , in particular , sticks out to Lina :
Nikolai Kretzsky .
Although he does n't at first come off as necessarily kind or helpful , Kretzsky more or less befriends Lina and her mother .
He can be seen as only being downright cruel to Lina only when around other NKVD members .
He does n't seem to want to hurt Lina unless he absolutely has to .
He is described as young , blonde - haired , and blue - eyed , and can be assumed to be quite handsome .
Their relationship grows and remains important throughout the book .
Andrius Arvydas is handsome , golden - brown haired , and a source of comfort for Lina .
At first , she dislikes him , dismissing him as an " idiot " because he smoked her book , which was a present from her deceased grandmother .
Their friendship blossoms but becomes troubled when Lina accuses Andrius and his mother for working for the NKVD .
It turns out his mother was being unwillingly used as a prostitute because of her beauty , but only to protect her son .
Andrius becomes Lina 's more - or - less boyfriend and gives Lina a new book .
Lina and her family are then separated from Andrius , when they are transported to a different camp across the Arctic Circle , where they are forced to build their own shelter to survive .
But then Lina 's mother dies .
Just when Lina doubted she would survive , a man who is a doctor as well as an inspector of the work camps , shows up giving everyone blankets and food .
The doctor takes them home .
After another long trip Lina finds Andrius , and they get married .

* Elena Vilkas : Lina and Jonas ' mother .
A loving woman , kind and generous with her gestures and food , who perishes from grief and her attempts to save her children by giving them her rations .

* Kostas Vilkas :
Lina and Jonas ' father , who is separated from his family and shipped to a prison called Krasnoyarsk .

* Andrius Arvydas : A handsome 17-year - old boy , whom Lina and her family meet in the train to the labor camps .

* Mrs. Arvydas : Andrius ' beautiful and dainty mother .
She becomes a prostitute for the NKVD after they threaten to kill her son if she did not do so .
* Nikolai Kretzsky : A young NKVD officer who helps Lina and her mother .

After losing her baby , Ona goes insane and is fatally shot by the NKVD .
