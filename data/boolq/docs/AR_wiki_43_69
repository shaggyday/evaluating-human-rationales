KEROSENE LAMP
A kerosene lamp ( also known as a paraffin lamp in some countries ) is a type of lighting device that uses kerosene ( paraffin ) as a fuel .
Invented by the Polish pharmacist Ignacy Łukasiewicz in 1853 , kerosene lamps have a wick or mantle as light source , protected by a glass chimney or globe ; lamps may be used on a table , or hand - held lanterns may be used for portable lighting .
Like oil lamps , they are useful for lighting without electricity , such as in regions without rural electrification , in electrified areas during power outages , at campsites , and on boats .
There are three types of kerosene lamp : flat - wick , central - draught ( tubular round wick ) , and mantle lamp .
Kerosene lanterns meant for portable use have a flat wick and are made in dead - flame , hot - blast , and cold - blast variants .
Pressurized kerosene lamps have a gas generator and gas mantle ; these are known as Petromax , Tilley lamps , or Coleman lamps , among other manufacturers .
They produce more light per unit of fuel than wick - type lamps , but are more complex and expensive in construction and more complex to operate .
A hand - pump pressurizes air , which forces liquid fuel from a reservoir into a gas generator .
Vapor from the gas generator burns , heating a mantle to incandescence and also providing heat to the gas generator .
The first description of a simple lamp using crude mineral oil was provided by Persian alchemist al - Razi ( Rhazes ) in 9th century Baghdad , who referred to it as the " naffatah " in his Kitab al - Asrar ( Book of Secrets ) .
In 1846 Abraham Pineo Gesner invented a substitute for whale oil for lighting , distilled from coal .
Later made from petroleum , kerosene became a popular lighting fuel .
Modern and most popular versions of the kerosene lamp were later constructed by Polish inventor and pharmacist Ignacy Łukasiewicz .
Kerosene lamps are widely used for lighting in rural areas of Africa and Asia , where electricity is not distributed or is too costly .
Kerosene lamps consume an estimated 77 billion litres of fuel per year , equivalent to 1.3 million barrels of oil per day , comparable to annual U.S. jet - fuel consumption of 76 billion litres per year .
TYPES
FLAT - WICK LAMP
Section::::Types .
Section::::Flat - wick lamp .
A flat - wick lamp is a simple type of kerosene lamp , which burns kerosene drawn up through a wick by capillary action .
If this type of lamp is broken , it can easily start a fire .
A flat - wick lamp has a fuel tank ( fount ) , with the lamp burner attached .
Attached to the fuel tank , four prongs hold the glass chimney , which acts to prevent the flame from being blown out and enhances a thermally induced draft .
The glass chimney needs a " throat " , or slight constriction , to create the proper draft for complete combustion of the fuel ; the draft carries more air ( oxygen ) past the flame , helping to produce a smokeless light , which is brighter than an open flame would produce .
The lamp burner has a flat wick , usually made of cotton .
The lower part of the wick dips into the fount and absorbs the kerosene ; the top part of the wick extends out of the wick tube of the lamp burner , which includes a wick - adjustment mechanism .
Adjusting how much of the wick extends above the wick tube controls the flame .
The wick tube surrounds the wick and ensures that the correct amount of air reaches the lamp burner .
Adjustment is usually done by means of a small knob operating a cric , which is a toothed metal sprocket bearing against the wick .
If the wick is too high , and extends beyond the burner cone at the top of the wick tube , the lamp will produce smoke and soot ( unburned carbon ) .
When the lamp is lit , the kerosene that the wick has absorbed burns and produces a clear , bright , yellow flame .
As the kerosene burns , capillary action in the wick draws more kerosene up from the fuel tank .
All kerosene flat - wick lamps use the dead - flame burner design , where the flame is fed cold air from below , and hot air exits above .
This type of lamp was very widely used by railways , both on the front and rear of trains and for hand signals , due to its reliability .
At a time when there were few competing light sources at night outside major towns , the limited brightness of these lamps was adequate and could be seen at sufficient distance to serve as a warning or signal .
CENTRAL - DRAFT ( TUBULAR ROUND WICK )
LAMP Section::::Central - draft ( tubular round wick )
lamp .
A central - draught lamp , or Argand lamp , works in the same manner as the flat - wick lamp .
The burner is equipped with a tall glass chimney , of around tall or taller , to provide the powerful draft this lamp requires to burn properly .
The burner uses a wick , usually made of cotton , that is made of a wide , flat wick rolled into a tube , the seam of which is then stitched together to form the complete wick .
The tubular wick is then mounted into a " carrier " , which is some form of a toothed rack that engages into the gears of the wick - raising mechanism of the burner and allows the wick to be raised and lowered .
The wick rides in between the inner and outer wick tubes ; the inner wick tube ( central draft tube ) provides the " central draft " or draft that supplies air to the flame spreader .
When the lamp is lit , the central draft tube supplies air to the flame spreader that spreads out the flame into a ring of fire and allows the lamp to burn cleanly .
MANTLE LAMP
Section::::Mantle lamp .
A variation on the " central - draught " lamp is the mantle lamp .
The mantle is a roughly pear - shaped mesh made of fabric placed over the burner .
The mantle typically contains thorium or other rare - earth salts ; on first use the cloth burns away , and the rare - earth salts are converted to oxides , leaving a very fragile structure , which incandesces ( glows brightly ) upon exposure to the heat of the burner flame .
Mantle lamps are considerably brighter than flat- or round - wick lamps , produce a whiter light and generate more heat .
Mantle lamps typically use fuel faster than a flat - wick lamp , but slower than a center - draught round - wick , as they depend on a small flame heating a mantle , rather than having all the light coming from the flame itself .
Mantle lamps are nearly always bright enough to benefit from a lampshade , and a few mantle lamps may be enough to heat a small building in cold weather .
Mantle lamps , because of the higher temperature at which they operate , do not produce much odor , except when first lit or extinguished .
Like flat- and round - wick lamps , they can be adjusted for brightness ; however , caution must be used , because if set too high , the lamp chimney and the mantle can become covered with black areas of soot .
A lamp set too high will burn off its soot harmlessly if quickly turned down , but if not caught soon enough , the soot itself can ignite , and a " runaway lamp " condition can result .
One popular model of mantle lamp uses only a wick and is unpressurized .
Pressurized mantle lamps contain a gas generator and require preheating the generator before lighting .
An air pump is used to deliver fuel under pressure to the gas generator .
Large fixed pressurized kerosene mantle lamps were used in lighthouse beacons for navigation of ships , brighter and with lower fuel consumption than oil lamps used before .
KEROSENE LANTERN Section::::Kerosene lantern .
A kerosene lantern , also known as a " barn lantern " or " hurricane lantern " , is a flat - wick lamp made for portable and outdoor use .
They are made of soldered or crimped - together sheet - metal stampings , with tin - plated sheet steel being the most common material , followed by brass and copper .
There are three types : dead - flame , hot - blast , and cold - blast .
Both hot - blast and cold - blast designs are called tubular lanterns and are safer than dead - flame lamps , as tipping over a tubular lantern cuts off the oxygen flow to the burner and will extinguish the flame within seconds .
The earliest portable kerosene " glass globe " lanterns , of the 1850s and 1860s , were of the dead - flame type , meaning that it had an open wick , but the airflow to the flame was strictly controlled in an upward motion by a combination of vents at the bottom of the burner and an open topped chimney .
This had the effect of removing side - to - side drafts and thus significantly reducing or even eliminating the flickering that can occur with an exposed flame .
Later lanterns , such as the hot - blast and cold - blast lanterns , took this airflow control even further by partially enclosing the wick in a " deflector " or " burner cone " and channeling the airflow through that restricted area , creating a brighter and even more stable flame .
The hot - blast design , also known as a " tubular lantern " due to the metal tubes used in its construction , was invented by John Irwin and patented on January 12 , 1868 .
The hot - blast design collected hot air from above the globe and fed it through metal side tubes to the burner , to make the flame burn brighter .
The cold - blast design is similar to the hot - blast , except that cold fresh air is drawn in from around the top of the globe and is then fed though the metal side tubes to the flame , making it burn brighter .
This design produces a brighter light than the hot - blast design , because the fresh air that is fed to the flame has plenty of oxygen to support the combustion process .
FUELS Section::::Fuels .
Generic lamp oil is available clear or in a choice of several colors and in scented and unscented forms .
Although more expensive , lamp oil is highly refined and burns more cleanly and with less odor than kerosene .
"
Lamp oil " must not be liquid paraffin .
"
Water - clear " K-1 kerosene is the next grade of preferred fuel for kerosene wick lamps .
In some locations " red kerosene " is sold , which is dyed red and is slightly less expensive than K-1 kerosene , as no motor - fuel taxes are collected on it .
Red kerosene is not recommended because the dye will gradually clog the lantern wick , causing odor and reduced performance .
Citronella - scented lamp oil containing lemongrass oil is sold for its insect repellent properties .
Citronella fuels should only be used outdoors .
Liquid paraffin - based " lamp oil " should only be used in round - wick lamps with a wick diameter of less than .
Used in larger wicks , this fuel causes the wicks to clog .
Flat - wick kerosene lamps should only be operated with kerosene or lamp oil , but alternative fuels can be used in an emergency .
Such fuels may produce additional smoke and odor and may not be usable indoors .
Tractor vaporizing oil is made from kerosene with some additive to make a motor fuel for tractors .
No . 1 diesel fuel ( also called winter diesel ) is about the same as kerosene but with the additives to make it a motor fuel .
Jet A jet - engine fuel is essentially kerosene with a few additives .
RP-1
( Rocket Propellant-1 ) is a highly refined form of kerosene outwardly similar to jet fuel , used as rocket fuel .
Round - wick center - draft lamps must only burn low - odor mineral spirits .
Any liquid with a low flash point presents a high risk of fire or explosion if used in a kerosene wick lamp .
Such liquids are dangerous and should not be used in a kerosene lamp or lantern .
Examples include : * charcoal lighter fluid , * gasoline ( petrol ) , * naphtha , white gas or Coleman fuel , * mineral spirits , paint thinner , white spirit ( Stoddard solvent ) , * other hydrocarbon solvents such as turpentine , benzene , xylene , toluene , acetone , camphene , lacquer thinner ,
* denatured alcohol .
Contamination of lamp fuel with even a small amount of gasoline results in a lower flash point and higher vapor pressure for the fuel , with potentially dangerous consequences .
Vapors from spilled fuel may ignite ; vapor trapped above liquid fuel may lead to excess pressure and fires .
Kerosene lamps are still extensively used in areas without electrical lighting ; the cost and dangers of combustion lighting are a continuing concern in many countries .
PERFORMANCE Section::::Performance .
Flat - wick lamps have the lowest light output , center - draft round - wick lamps have 3–4 times the output of flat - wick lamps , and pressurized lamps have higher output yet ; the range is from 8 to 100 lumens .
A kerosene lamp producing 37 lumens for 4 hours per day consumes about 3 litres of kerosene per month .
