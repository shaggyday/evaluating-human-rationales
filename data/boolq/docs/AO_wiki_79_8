CLOAK
A cloak is a type of loose garment that is worn over indoor clothing and serves the same purpose as an overcoat ; it protects the wearer from the cold , rain or wind for example , or it may form part of a fashionable outfit or uniform .
Cloaks have been used by a myriad historic societies ; many climates favor wearing a full - body garment which is easily removed and does not constrain the wearer with sleeves .
Over time cloak designs have been changed to match fashion and available textiles .
Cloaks generally fasten at the neck or over the shoulder , vary in length , from hip all the way down to the ankle , mid - calf being the normal length .
They may have an attached hood and may cover and fasten down the front , in which case they have holes or slits for the hands to pass through .
However , cloaks are almost always sleeveless .
ETYMOLOGY Section::::Etymology .
The word cloak comes from Old North French cloque ( Old French cloche , cloke ) meaning " travelling cloak " , from Medieval Latin clocca " travelers ' cape , " literally " a bell , " so called from the garment 's bell - like shape .
Thus the word is related to the word clock .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Ancient Greeks and Romans were known to wear cloaks .
Greek men and women wore the himation , from the Archaic through the Hellenistic periods ( c. 750 - 30 BC ) .
Romans would later wear the Greek - styled cloak , the pallium .
The pallium was quadrangular , shaped like a square , and sat on the shoulders , not unlike the himation .
Romans of the Republic would wear the toga as a formal display of their citizenship .
It was denied to foreigners and was worn by magistrates on all occasions as a badge of office .
The toga was claimed to have originated with Numa Pompilius , the second king of Rome .
OPERA CLOAK Section::::Opera cloak .
In full evening dress in the Western countries , ladies and gentlemen frequently use the cloak as a fashion statement , or to protect the fine fabrics of evening wear from the elements , especially where a coat would crush or hide the garment .
Opera cloaks are made of quality materials such as wool or cashmere , velvet and satin .
Ladies may wear a long ( over the shoulders or to ankles ) cloak usually called a cape , or a full - length cloak .
Gentlemen wear an ankle - length or full - length cloak .
Formal cloaks often have expensive , colored linings and trimmings such as silk , satin , velvet and fur .
IN LITERATURE AND THE ARTS Section::::In literature and the arts .
According to the King James Version of the Bible , Matthew recorded Jesus of Galilee saying in Matthew 5:40 : " And if any man will sue thee at the law , and take away thy coat , let him have thy cloke also .
" The King James Version of the Bible has the words recorded a little differently in Luke 6:29 : " ... and him that taketh away thy cloke , forbid not to take thy coat also . "
Cloaks are a staple garment in the fantasy genre due to the popularity of medieval settings , although fantasy cloak designs normally have more resemblance to 18th or 19th - century cloaks rather than medieval ones .
They are also usually associated with witches , wizards , and vampires ; the best - known stage version of Dracula , which first made actor Bela Lugosi prominent , featured him wearing it so that his exit through a trap door concealed on the stage could seem sudden .
When Lugosi reprised his role as Dracula for the 1931 Universal Studios motion picture version of the play , he retained the cloak as part of his outfit , which made such a strong impression that cloaks came to be equated with Count Dracula in nearly all non - historical media depictions of him .
Fantasy cloaks are often magical .
For example , they may grant the person wearing it invisibility as in the Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling .
A similar sort of garment is worn by the members of the Fellowship of the Ring in The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien , although instead of granting complete invisibility , the Elf - made cloaks simply appear to shift between any natural color ( e.g. green , gray , brown ) to help the wearer to blend in with his or her surroundings .
Alternatively , they may nullify magical projectiles , as the " cloak of magic resistance " in NetHack .
In addition , the magical hide armor that Hercules made for himself from the skin of the Nemean Lion , at the end of Hercules ' first labor , might also be seen as an early idea of a magical cloak .
This latter was notable because it was said to be impervious to all cutting and impact weapons .
METAPHOR Section::::Metaphor .
Figuratively , a cloak may be anything that disguises or conceals something .
In many science fiction worlds such as Star Trek , there are cloaking devices , which provide a way to avoid detection or to make objects appear invisible .
Because they keep a person hidden and conceal a weapon , the phrase cloak and dagger has come to refer to espionage and secretive crimes : it suggests murder from hidden sources .
" Cloak and dagger " stories are thus mystery , detective , and crime stories of this .
The vigilante duo of Marvel comics Cloak and Dagger is a reference to this .
