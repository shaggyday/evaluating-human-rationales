PIXEL DENSITY Pixels per inch ( ppi ) or pixels per centimeter ( ppcm ) are measurements of the pixel density ( resolution ) of an electronic image device , such as a computer monitor or television display , or image digitizing device such as a camera or image scanner .
Horizontal and vertical density are usually the same , as most devices have square pixels , but differ on devices that have non - square pixels .
Pixels per inch ( or pixels per centimeter ) can also describe the resolution , in pixels , of an image file .
A 100×100 pixel image printed in a 1 inch square has a resolution of 100 pixels per inch .
Used this way , the measurement is meaningful when printing an image .
It has become commonplace to refer to PPI as DPI , even though PPI refers to input resolution .
Industry standard , good quality photographs usually require 300 pixels per inch , at 100 % size , when printed onto coated paper stock , using a printing screen of 150 lines per inch ( lpi ) .
This delivers a quality factor of 2 , which is optimum .
The lowest acceptable quality factor is considered 1.5 , which equates to printing a 225 ppi image using a 150 lpi screen onto coated paper .
Screen frequency is determined by the type of paper the image is printed on .
An absorbent paper surface , uncoated recycled paper for instance , lets ink droplets spread ( dot gain)—so requires a more open printing screen .
Input resolution can therefore be reduced to minimize file size without loss in quality , as long as the quality factor of 2 is maintained .
This is easily determined by doubling the line frequency .
For example , printing on an uncoated paper stock often limits printing screen frequency to no more than 120 lpi , therefore , a quality factor of 2 is achieved with images of 240 ppi .
COMPUTER DISPLAYS Section::::Computer displays .
The PPI of a computer display is related to the size of the display in inches and the total number of pixels in the horizontal and vertical directions .
This measurement is often referred to as dots per inch , though that measurement more accurately refers to the resolution of a computer printer .
For example , a 15-inch ( 38 cm ) display whose dimensions work out to 12 inches ( 30.48 cm ) wide by 9 inches ( 22.86 cm )
high , capable of a maximum 1024×768 ( or XGA ) pixel resolution , can display around 85 PPI in both the horizontal and vertical directions .
This figure is determined by dividing the width ( or height ) of the display area in pixels by the width ( or height ) of the display area in inches .
It is possible for a display to have different horizontal and vertical PPI measurements ( e.g. , a typical 4:3 ratio CRT monitor showing a 1280×1024 mode computer display at maximum size , which is a 5:4 ratio , not quite the same as 4:3 ) .
The apparent PPI of a monitor depends upon the screen resolution ( that is , the number of pixels ) and the size of the screen in use ; a monitor in 800×600 mode has a lower PPI than does the same monitor in a 1024×768 or 1280×960 mode .
The dot pitch of a computer display determines the absolute limit of possible pixel density .
Typical circa-2000 cathode ray tube or LCD computer displays range from 67 to 130 PPI , though desktop monitors have exceeded 200 PPI and contemporary small - screen mobile devices often exceed 300 PPI , sometimes by a wide margin .
In January 2008 , Kopin Corporation announced a 0.44 inch ( 1.12 cm ) SVGA LCD with a pixel density of 2272 PPI ( each pixel only 11.25μm ) .
In 2011 they followed this up with a 3760 DPI 0.21 " diagonal VGA colour display .
The manufacturer says they designed the LCD to be optically magnified , as in high - resolution eyewear devices .
Holography applications demand even greater pixel density , as higher pixel density produces a larger image size and wider viewing angle .
Spatial light modulators can reduce pixel pitch to 2.5 μm , giving a pixel density of 10,160 PPI .
Some observations indicate that the unaided human generally ca n't differentiate detail beyond 300 PPI .
However , this figure depends both on the distance between viewer and image , and the viewer 's visual acuity .
The human eye also responds in a different way to a bright , evenly lit interactive display from how it does to prints on paper .
High pixel density display technologies would make supersampled antialiasing obsolete , enable true WYSIWYG graphics and , potentially enable a practical " paperless office " era .
For perspective , such a device at 15 inch ( 38 cm ) screen size would have to display more than four Full HD screens ( or WQUXGA resolution ) .
Development of a display with ~900 ppi allows for three pixels with 16-bit color to act as sub - pixels to form a pixel cluster .
These pixel clusters act as regular pixels at ~300 ppi to produce a 48-bit color display .
The PPI pixel density specification of a display is also useful for calibrating a monitor with a printer .
Software can use the PPI measurement to display a document at " actual size " on the screen .
CALCULATION OF MONITOR PPI Section::::Calculation of monitor PPI .
Theoretically , PPI can be calculated from knowing the diagonal size of the screen in inches and the resolution in pixels ( width and height ) .
This can be done in two steps : 1 .
Calculate diagonal resolution in pixels using the Pythagorean theorem : 2 .
Calculate PPI : where * formula_3 is diagonal resolution in pixels
*
formula_4 is width resolution in pixels
* formula_5 is height resolution in pixels *
formula_6 is diagonal size in inches ( this is the number advertised as the size of the display ) .
For example , : * For a 21.5 inch ( 54.61 cm ) screen with a 1920×1080 resolution ( in which formula_4 = 1920 , formula_5 = 1080 and formula_6 = 21.5 ) , we get 102.46 PPI ; *
For a typical 10.1 inch netbook screen with a 1024×600 resolution ( in which formula_4 = 1024 , formula_5 = 600 and formula_6 = 10.1 ) , we get 117.5 PPI .
* For 27 inch screen with a 2560x1440 resolution we get formula_13 = 108.8 PPI .
Note that these calculations may not be very precise .
Frequently , screens advertised as " X inch screen " can have their real physical dimensions of viewable area differ , for example :
* Apple Inc. advertised their mid-2011 iMac as a " 21.5 inch ( viewable ) [ ... ] display , " but its actual viewable area is 545.22 mm or 21.465 inches .
The more precise figure increases the calculated PPI from 102.46 ( using 21.5 ) to 102.63 .
* The HP LP2065 20 inch ( 50.8 cm ) monitor has an actual viewable area of 20.1 inch ( 51 cm ) .
CALCULATING PPI OF CAMERA VIEW SCREENS Section::::Calculating PPI of camera view screens .
Camera manufacturers often quote view screens in ' number of dots ' .
This is not the same as the number of pixels , because there are 3 ' dots ' per pixel – red , green and blue .
For example , the Canon 50d is quoted as having 920,000 dots .
This translates as 307,200 pixels ( x3 = 921,600 dots ) .
Thus the screen is 640×480 pixels .
This must be taken into account when working out the PPI .
Using the above calculations requires the screen 's dimensions , but other methods require the total pixels , not total dots . '
Dots ' and ' pixels ' are often confused in reviews and specs when viewing information about digital cameras specifically .
SCANNERS AND CAMERAS Section::::Scanners and cameras .
" PPI " or " pixel density " may also describe image scanner resolution .
In this context , PPI is synonymous with samples per inch .
In digital photography , pixel density is the number of pixels divided by the area of the sensor .
A typical DSLR , circa 2013 , has 1–6.2 MP / cm ; a typical compact has 20–70 MP / cm .
For example , Sony Alpha SLT - A58 has 20.1 megapixels on an APS - C sensor having 6.2 MP / cm since a compact camera like Sony Cyber - shot DSC - HX50V has 20.4 megapixels on an 1/2.3 " sensor having 70 MP / cm .
The professional camera has a lower PPI than a compact camera , because it has larger photodiodes due to having far larger sensors .
SMARTPHONES
Section::::Smartphones .
Smartphones use small displays , but modern smartphone displays have a larger PPI rating , such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 with a quad HD display at 577 PPI ,
Fujitsu F-02 G with a quad HD display at 564 PPI , the LG G6 with quad HD display at 564 PPI or – XHDPI or Oppo Find 7 with 534 PPI on 5.5 " display – XXHDPI ( see section below ) .
Sony 's Xperia XZ Premium has a 4 K display with a pixel density of 807 PPI , the highest of any smartphone as of 2017 .

The digital publishing industry primarily uses " pixels per inch " but sometimes " pixels per centimeter " is used or a conversion factor is given .
The PNG image file format only allows the meter as the unit for pixel density .
