SPIKE ( BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER )
Spike , played by James Marsters , is a fictional character created by Joss Whedon for the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel .
Spike is a vampire and played various roles on the shows , including villain , anti - hero , trickster and romantic interest .
For Marsters , the role as Spike began a career in science fiction television , becoming " the obvious go - to guy for US cult [ television ] . "
For creator Whedon , Spike is the " most fully developed " of his characters .
The character was intended to be a brief villain , with Whedon originally adamant to not have another major " romantic vampire " character like Angel .
Marsters says " Spike was supposed to be dirty and evil , punk rock , and then dead . "
However , the character ended up staying for the second season , and then returning in the fourth to replace Cordelia as " the character who told Buffy she was stupid and about to die . "
Within the series ' narrative , William was an unsuccessful aspiring poet in the Victorian era who was mocked and called " William the Bloody " because of his " bloody awful " poetry .
Sired by the vampire Drusilla ( Juliet Landau ) , William became an unusually passionate and romantic vampire , being very violent and ready to battle , but not as cruel as his companions .
Alongside Drusilla , Darla ( Julie Benz ) and Angelus ( David Boreanaz ) , Giles thinks William acquired the nickname Spike for his preferred method of torturing people with railroad spikes , but it is revealed it is because his poetry was " so bad you could stick a railroad spike through your head . "
He was noted for killing two vampire Slayers ; one in China at the end of the 1800s during the Boxer Rebellion , the other was Nicki Wood in 1977 New York , where Spike acquired his trademark leather duster .
During the second season of the series , Spike comes to Sunnydale hoping to kill a third Slayer , Buffy Summers ( Sarah Michelle Gellar ) , with whom he later forges an uneasy alliance .
Over the course of Buffy , Spike falls in love with the Slayer , reacquires his soul to prove himself to Buffy and dies a hero in the show 's series finale .
He is subsequently resurrected in the first episode of the fifth season of the spin - off series Angel .
Considered a ' breakout character ' , Spike proved immensely popular with fans of Buffy .
The character appears substantially in Expanded Universe materials such as comic books and tie - in novels .
Following the cancellation of Angel in 2004 , Whedon considered creating a Spike film spin - off .
Canonically , the character appears in issues of the comic books
Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season
Eight ( 2007–11 ) , ( 2007–09 ) , Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine , Angel & Faith ( both 2011–2013 ) and several Spike limited series , spinning off from both Buffy and Angel .
Currently the character is in the canonical comic Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eleven ( 2016–2017 ) .

Section::::Early history .
Spike 's story before he appears in Sunnydale unfolds in flashbacks scattered , out of sequence , among numerous episodes of both Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel .
The first flashback occurs in Buffy Season Five 's " Fool for Love " , and reveals William as in fact a meek , young man ( and an aspiring poet ) who lived in London with his mother , Anne .
Anne would often sing the folksong " Early One Morning " to her son , right up until the time he was turned into a vampire .
William 's surname is given as " Pratt " in the non - canon comic and is written on the label of his jar of blood in the comic # 002 .
This surname became official with the publication of the canon comic Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 11 # 7 , in which Buffy calls him by it .
The name William Pratt may allude to horror actor Boris Karloff , whose birth name was William Henry Pratt , and can also be understood as the British slang term " prat " , describing a person of arrogant stupidity .
Spike is one of the youngest recurring vampires on the show , though the evidence of his age is contradictory , as the concept of the character evolved over time .
When he was introduced in " School Hard " ( season 2 ) , Giles read that he was " barely two hundred , " implying that he was either born or sired in 1797 or slightly earlier .
In " The Initiative " ( season 4 ) he said he was 126 , thus born or sired in 1874 .
Flashbacks in " Fool for Love " ( season 5 ) show that Spike was sired as an adult in 1880 .
Assuming he was in his early to mid 20s when he was sired , Spike would be in his 140s during the series .
In the comic # 002 , Spike 's jar of blood has a label giving his assumed human birth date in 1853 , about 27 years before he was sired .
In 1880 , William was a struggling poet , often mocked by his peers who called him " William the Bloody " behind his back because his poetry was so " bloody awful .
" The true origins of this nickname were not revealed until three years after it was first mentioned in Season Two , when it was believed to have purely violent connotations .
William showed a strong capacity for loyalty and devoted love , which remained after his siring .
After his romantic overtures were rejected by the aristocratic Cecily , William wandered the streets despondently and bumped into Drusilla .
She consoled him , drained him of blood and made him drink of her blood , thus transforming him into a vampire – " siring " him , in the jargon of the series .
Spike 's grand - sire
Angelus became his mentor ( leading Spike occasionally to describe him loosely as his sire ) :
" Drusilla sired me , but you , you made me a monster . "
Whereas new vampires in the Buffyverse often delight in killing their families once they become evil , William was a notable exception .
Having always been very close to his mother , he turned her into a vampire to save her from tuberculosis .
But his mother , as a vampire , taunted William and insinuated he had always had a sexual fascination with her .
William chose to stake her because he found he could not bear to see his mother behaving like the soulless vampire he had made of her .
She , like most vampires , lacked his unusual capacity for some of the softer human emotions , like love and compassion .
After staking his mother , William began a new life with Drusilla , to whom he was utterly devoted .
Euphoric with his newfound vampiric abilities , he adopted the poses and trappings of a cultural rebel , affecting a working class East London accent and embracing impulsiveness and extreme violence .
He adopted the nom de guerre " Spike " based on his habit of torturing people with railroad spikes – possibly prompted by criticism of his poetry : " I 'd rather have a railroad spike through my head than listen to that awful stuff . "
In " The Weight of the World " Spike mentions having spent " the better part of a century " in delinquency , suggesting criminal activities other than killing for blood .
In the company of Drusilla , Angelus and Darla , Spike terrorized Europe and Asia for almost two decades .
He had a strained relationship with Drusilla 's sire Angelus , who continued a sexual relationship with her despite Spike 's strong disapproval .
Although Angelus did enjoy the company of another male vampire in their travels , he found Spike 's recklessness and lust for battle to be unnecessary risks .
Angelus regarded killing as an art , not a sport , and killed for the sheer act of evil ; Spike did it for amusement and the rush .
In 1894 , Spike and Angelus developed a rivalry with the enigmatic Immortal , who later had Spike sent to prison for tax evasion .
In 1900 , Spike killed Xin_Rong , a Chinese Slayer while in China during the Boxer Rebellion .
In 1943 , he was captured by Nazis for experimentation and taken aboard a submarine , where he was briefly reunited with Angel .
By the 1950s , Spike had reunited with Drusilla , and they traveled to Italy .
At some point , Spike also became rivals with the famous vampire Dracula .
The enmity between Spike and Dracula was explored in the comic series Spike vs. Dracula , in which their mutual hatred is caused when Spike , along with Darla and Drusilla , slaughtered the Romani ( gypsy ) tribe who had cursed their patriarch , Angelus , with a soul , although it is unclear if either Spike or Drusilla knew precisely why Darla was so angry with the tribe .
That clan ( unknown to Spike ) was favored by Dracula and he sought revenge for their deaths .
Spike later mentions in a conversation with Riley Finn , " Dracula ?
bugger owes me £ 11 , for one thing , " because Dracula tossed Spike 's signed copy of Bram Stoker 's Dracula in a fire in 1898 .
Spike also notes that Dracula 's fame has done more damage to vampires than any Slayer , since it made their weaknesses more widely known .
Spike attended Woodstock in 1969 , whereupon he accidentally became high after ingesting the blood of a hippie , he claims to have spent the next six hours following the incident " watching my hand move " .
In 1977 he fought and killed a second Slayer , Nikki Wood , aboard a subway train in New York City , taking from her a black leather duster which he wears throughout his appearances on Buffy and Angel until it is destroyed in an explosion in Season Five of Angel , whereupon he gets a new one that looks exactly like the old one ( " The Girl in Question " ) .
At some point post-1977 , Billy Idol allegedly " stole " Spike 's look and made it famous as his own ( as revealed in Season Seven 's " Sleeper " ; see " Appearance " below ) ; Spike 's thoughts on this are unrecorded .
Inasmuch as Buffy knew of the " theft " as of " Sleeper , " Spike presumably shared the detail with her in an undepicted moment .

Precisely what Spike and Drusilla make of these developments between their " elders " is unrevealed .

SUNNYDALE Section::::Sunnydale .
Spike first arrives in Sunnydale in the second season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer , in the episode " School Hard " , accompanied by Drusilla .
Spike and Dru were modeled on Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen ; punk , " badass " vampires to contrast sharply with the more ceremonial tradition of the Master and the Order of Aurelius from Season One .
Spike is in fact a fan of Sid Vicious ' band The Sex Pistols and punk band The Ramones .
In the final scene of the episode " Lovers Walk " , he can be seen singing to a cover of " My Way " by Gary Oldman , who portrayed Vicious in the film Sid and Nancy .
Spike 's first act in Sunnydale is to attack Buffy and a large group of people at her school , making his first appearance the deadliest of any of Buffys " Big Bads " , as he very nearly kills Buffy , but Buffy 's mother distracts Spike long enough for Buffy to recover .
Throughout Season Two , Spike and Dru are the canon 's most prominent example of affection between vampires , displaying the humanity and intricacies of vampire relationships .
Spike was initially conceived as a disposable villain to be killed off , but proved so popular with fans that Joss Whedon decided to merely injure him instead , in the episode
" What 's My Line , Part Two " , in which Spike is crushed by a collapsing pipe organ and left paralyzed .
( Later it is revealed that he has healed but chosen to stay in the wheelchair to deceive Angel whom he intended to betray . )
Spike and Drusilla are major enemies of Buffy for much of the second season .
They arrive shortly after Drusilla is seriously weakened by an angry mob in Prague , as recounted in the canon comic book The Problem with Vampires .
Spike is a devoted caretaker to Drusilla in her weakened condition , and initially hopes the Hellmouth 's energy can help restore her strength .
He reunites with Angel and seems genuinely pleased to see him , but is disgusted to find that Angel has a soul ( whether or not Spike in fact knew that Angel 's acquisition of a soul is why he left the group nearly a century before has never been made clear ) and is in love with the current Slayer , Buffy Summers .
When Angel loses his soul and rejoins Spike and Dru , Spike 's initial celebration soon turns to resentment when Angelus starts pursuing Drusilla as a lover and taunting him .
Spike decides to ally himself with Buffy against Angelus ; as he explains to Buffy , in addition to wanting Drusilla back , he also wants to " save the world " :
Spike reappears in the Season Three episode
" Lovers Walk " , in a drunken depression after Drusilla , offended by his alliance with Buffy , dumps him for a Chaos demon .
He kidnaps Willow and Xander , and forces Willow to conduct a love spell for him to make Drusilla love him again , even coercing Buffy and Angel to help him in exchange for the safe return of their friends .
The excitement of a brawl with the Mayor 's vampires helps him see that Drusilla left him because he had begun to go soft ; he resolves to win her back by torturing her until she likes him again , and tells Buffy where to find Willow and Xander .
He also tells Buffy and Angel that they can never be friends because of their love for one another .
This insight foreshadows Spike 's later role as the " truth - seer " of the group .
Spike returns to Sunnydale alone in Season Four , in the episode " The Harsh Light of Day " , briefly living with Harmony Kendall , a shallow former classmate of Buffy , now a vampire .
He is in Sunnydale to look for the Gem of Amarra , a ring which makes a vampire effectively invulnerable .
He finds it and attacks Buffy in daylight , but she wrests the ring from his finger and sends it to Angel .
Spike goes to Los Angeles , and hires a vampire named Marcus to torture Angel in order to get the ring , but Marcus takes the ring himself and Angel finally destroys it .
After being captured by The Initiative and implanted with a cerebral microchip which punishes him with debilitating pain whenever he harms or attempts to harm any non - demon life forms ( he initially assumes it works the same with anything living ) , Spike turns to the Scooby Gang for protection , bartering his knowledge of the Initiative .
( Though he still spars with Buffy , provided he has no real intent on harming her )
His inability to bite is comically compared to impotence , much to Spike 's constant humiliation ; in " Doomed " , he attempts to commit suicide by staking himself at Xander 's house , but is stopped by Willow and Xander .
Eventually , he inadvertantly discovers that he can harm demons and enthusiastically joins a fight with this knowledge , showing that he 's less concerned about what side he 's fighting on than fighting for the thrill of it .
Occasionally helping the Scooby Gang by providing them with information and/or combat assistance in exchange for cash or for the joy of fighting , but having no qualms about betraying them to such enemies as Faith and Adam .
In Season Four , Spike was introduced to fill the antagonistic role that Cordelia had in seasons One to Three ; as Joss Whedon explains on the DVD featurette , " All of our characters got to the point where they were loving and hugging , and it was sort of like , where 's Cordelia ? "
Spike appeared in every episode thereafter with the exception of " The Body " .
In Season Five , after some erotic dreams , Spike becomes aware to his horror that he has fallen in love with Buffy .
He becomes a more active participant in the Scooby Gang , jumping into several of Buffy 's fights to provide assistance , whether she wants it or not .
When Buffy rejects his advances , Spike attempts to prove his love by kidnapping her so that she can witness him killing Drusilla for her , to little avail ; in her disgust , Buffy un - invites him from her house ( something she had not bothered to do in almost three years since their alliance against Angelus ) and alienates him from the group .
Spike then has Warren Mears make a robot in Buffy 's likeness , programmed to love and obey him .
Though Buffy is disgusted by this , her hostility towards him fades considerably when she learns that Spike refused , even under intense torture , to reveal the identity of The Key to Glory , nearly laying down his life to protect Buffy 's sister Dawn .
Buffy is moved by this unexpected loyalty and kisses him , saying she will not forget what he has done .
In the days and hours leading up to the final showdown with Glory , Spike fights by Buffy 's side , earning her trust and a re - invitation to her house .
Spike displays unabashed grief after Buffy dies in the showdown with Glory , Spike honors her memory by remaining loyal to the Scoobies , fighting at their side and serving the role of baby - sitter / older brother / protector to Dawn , helping Willow and Tara to raise her in Buffy 's absence .
After Buffy is resurrected at the beginning of Season Six , she is despondent and detached from her friends .
During this time , her relationship to Spike deepens and she is able to talk to him about things she feels she can not share with the Scooby Gang .
She gets drunk with Spike , and calls him " a neutered vampire who cheats at kitten poker . "
After a demon 's spell makes them express their emotions in song , and Buffy sings "
I want the fire back " ,
Buffy and Spike begin a physical relationship , consummated two episodes later .
The relationship is frequently violent , with Buffy most often initiating both the violence and the sex between them ; the violence is made all the easier when Spike finds that ( as a side effect of Willow 's resurrection spell ) his chip now does not stop him from harming Buffy .
Buffy threatens to kill Spike if he ever tells anyone about their relationship .
Both are unsatisfied ; Buffy is ashamed of her dark desires , while Spike obsessively craves the love , trust , and affection that she is unwilling to give .
In " As You Were " , Buffy tells Spike she is using him and ends their relationship .
Believing he still has a chance with Buffy after seeing her reactions of jealousy and hurt when he has a drunk sexual encounter with Anya , Spike corners her and makes aggressive sexual advances .
When she refuses him , he grows desperate and unsuccessfully tries to rape her .
He is at once horrified by his own actions and intentions , while also somewhat remiss that he did not go through with the rape , since he is still essentially a demon and has had no problem committing such acts in the past .
This is seen in his reactions to reliving the memory of the event while discussing his subsequent mood with Clem , who has come by with hot wings to hang out .
Spike heads to a remote area of Africa , where he seeks out a legendary demon shaman and undergoes the Demon Trials , a series of grueling physical challenges .
Proving his worthiness by surviving the trials , Spike earns his soul back .
In Season Seven , a re - ensouled Spike must cope with the guilt of his past actions and try to win back Buffy 's trust .
But under influence of the First Evil 's hypnotic trigger , Spike unknowingly starts killing again .
Upon discovering what he has done , he begs Buffy to stake him , but she refuses and takes him into her house , telling him she has seen him change .
Buffy guards and cares for Spike throughout his recovery , telling Spike she believes in him , a statement which later sustains him throughout his imprisonment and torture at the hands of the First .
When Spike 's chip begins to malfunction , causing him intense pain and threatening to kill him , Buffy trusts him enough to order the Initiative operatives to remove it from his head .
When Nikki Wood 's son Robin tries to kill Spike , he unwittingly frees Spike from his hypnotic trigger :
the song " Early One Morning " , a favorite of his mother , which evokes Spike 's traumatic memories of his mother 's abusive behavior toward him after she turned ; after Spike is able to address these issues , he realizes his mother had always loved him , knowledge which frees him from the First 's control .
Later in the season , Spike and Buffy achieve an emotional closeness ; he alone stays loyal to her when the Scoobies and Potentials mutiny against her , and his words and encouragement give a depressed Buffy the strength to continue fighting .
They spend three nights together , one of which Spike describes as the best night of his life , just holding her .
It is unclear whether they resume their sexual intimacy during the third night ; creator Joss Whedon says on the DVD commentary for " Chosen " that he intentionally left it to the viewers to decide how they felt the relationship progressed , though Whedon had earlier stated on the commentary he personally felt having them resume a sexual relationship would send the wrong message .
In the final battle inside the Hellmouth , Spike , wearing a mystical amulet , sacrifices himself to destroy the Turok - Han and close the Hellmouth .
He is slowly incinerated in the process , but not before Buffy tells him " I love you . "
He replies , " No , you do n't ; but thanks for saying it . "
Even as he burns and crumbles to dust , Spike laughs and revels in the destruction around him and the burning presence of his soul , glad to be able to see the fight to its end .
In dying to save the world , he becomes a Champion .
LOS ANGELES Section::::Los Angeles .
Spike had previously appeared in the season 1 episode of Angel " In the Dark " , Spike goes to Los Angeles at the same time as Oz arrives to give Angel the Gem of Amarra , Spike 's objective was to get the ring and kill Angel .
Oz gives Angel the ring who then hides it in the sewer , just as he is about to leave for another case he is ambushed by Spike who hits him with a wooden plank , Angel defeats Spike
but Spike warns him that he will get the ring one way or another .
Angel takes precaution and goes on a manhunt for Spike , Angel finally finds him , chases him through the alley , and corners him only to fall into Spike 's trap .
Spike captures Angel and hires a vampire named Marcus to torture Angel until he tells him where the ring is .
After a while Spike gets bored of waiting so he goes to Angel 's apartment to find the ring and leaving Marcus to torture Angel , he gets to the apartment only to find Cordelia and Doyle aiming at him with weapons and demanding to know where Angel is .
Spike reveals Angel 's location and tells them that the only way he will release Angel is if they find him the ring .
Cordelia and Doyle find the ring in the sewer and head straight to Spike .
When they arrive at the location they find out that Spike had lied about releasing Angel .
Taking precautions however , they then throw the ring away and just as Spike was about to retrieve it , Oz bursts through the wall in his van and rescues Angel .
Spike looks for the ring but finds out that Marcus took it .
Spike begins smashing Marcus 's things and shouting about how he is going to work alone from now on until a hole that was in the ceiling lets sunlight in and sets the back of his hair on fire .
Despite his apparent death at the end of Buffy final season , Spike returns in the fifth and final season of the spin - off series Angel .
Resurrected by the amulet in the Los Angeles branch of supernatural law firm Wolfram & Hart , he spends seven episodes as an incorporeal being akin to a ghost ; he starts to understand being one when he battles " the Reaper " Matthias Pavayne .
During this time he realizes he is being slowly pulled into hell .
Later he becomes corporeal , due to a mysterious gift that arrives at the office of Wolfram and Hart .
Soon afterward he is kidnapped by the psychotic Slayer Dana , who believes he was responsible for kidnapping and torturing her as a child .
After this , Spike takes on Angel to prove which one of them is the Champion spoken of in the Shanshu Prophecy .
Spike defeats Angel , but the prophecy remains ambiguous ( the Cup of Torment is revealed as a fake containing Mountain Dew ) .
Manipulated by Lindsey McDonald into " helping the helpless " , Spike becomes a sort of rival to Angel ; resembling the heroic Champion Angel was in earlier seasons before becoming disillusioned and corrupted by the bureaucracy of Wolfram & Hart .
Cordelia comments on this strange turn of events after coming out of her coma in " You 're Welcome " , exclaiming to Angel , "
Okay , Spike 's a hero , and you 're CEO of Hell , Incorporated .
What freaking bizarro world did I wake up in ? "
When Fred is killed by Illyria , Spike mourns her death and decides to join Team Angel in her honor .
Upon learning that Buffy is now dating The Immortal , Spike and Angel travel to Rome on the pretext of business but spend most of the time there trying to find Buffy .
In the end , they fail to catch up with her .
( The blonde glimpsed in Rome is later revealed to be a decoy Buffy , set up by Andrew Wells , who had researched the history between Angel , Spike and The Immortal , and thought the idea would be " hilarious " . )
During the final episodes of Angel , Spike is the first to vote for Angel 's plan to wound the Senior Partners by massacring the Circle of the Black Thorn .
He then spends what might be his last hours on Earth returning to his mortal roots as a frustrated poet , triumphantly knocking them dead ( figuratively ) in an open mic poetry slam at a bar .
After single - handedly ( literally , he held the baby in one hand and a sword in the other ) rescuing an infant and destroying the Fell Brethren , Spike joins Angel , Illyria , and a badly wounded Charles Gunn in the alley behind the Hyperion as the series draws to an end , preparing to incur the apocalyptic wrath of the Senior Partners , as a way of going out in a blaze of glory that will probably cost their lives .
LITERATURE
Section::::Literature .
Spike appears significantly in a number of canonical Expanded Universe literature concurrent with and subsequent to the television series , including both Buffy and Angel comic books .
Many of these novels and comic books concern Spike 's backstory in the periods between the events shown in flashbacks in the television series .
From 2007 , both Dark Horse Comics and IDW Publishing began telling canonical continuations of Buffy and Angel , respectively .
Marsters himself wrote for the miniseries Spike & Dru in 2000 .
The collection also featured the Christopher Golden stories " The Queen of Hearts " , " All 's Fair " , " Paint the Town Red " and " Who Made Who ? " , set in or around episodes of Buffy in Seasons Two and Four ; " Who Made Who " is set during the Buffy episode " Lovers Walk " and depicts the disintegration of his relationship with Drusilla when they were together in Brazil .
After Buffy finished in 2003 , Spike appeared in a comic story from the canonical Tales of the Vampires series .
Written by series writer Drew Goddard , " The Problem with Vampires " establishes his adventures in Prague prior to his introduction Buffy episode " School Hard " .
Christopher Golden 's 2000 novel depicts Spike killing a Slayer named Sophie in the 1940s , contradicting the two Slayers whom Spike is later established to have killed ; the second Slayer Spike killed was established as New Yorker Nikki Wood .
The short story " Voodoo Lounge " from the collection Tales of the Slayer is a sequel to this novel .
Golden 's 2006 novel , Blackout , is truer to the series ' chronology by depicting Spike 's fatal encounter with Slayer Nikki Wood in 1977 .
Diana G. Gallagher 's 2005 novel Spark and Burn depicts the struggling early - Season Seven Spike remembering an account of his life , amounting to a chronological character history of Spike 's life from the 19th century to the time of the framing device .
In IDW 's , Spike does not appear until the second issue , written by Brian Lynch with art by Franco Urru ( the creative team of and ) with plotting and " executive production " by Whedon himself .
In Angel : After the Fall , Spike has adjusted to Los Angeles ' new status as a literal hell on Earth ; he and Illyria both serve together as the Demon Lords of Beverly Hills , living in the Playboy Mansion after the death of Hugh Hefner and served by a harem of human and demon females known collectively as the " Spikettes . "
How Spike and Illyria got to be Lords of Los Angeles is detailed in the Spike :
After the Fall ( 2008 ) miniseries , which also introduces a human friend for Spike in Jeremy Johns .
In their new capacity , Spike and Illyria secretly rescue humans and benevolent demons , evacuating them into the care of Connor , Nina Ash , and Gwen Raiden .
Spike rallies alongside Angel against the other demon Lords .
When vampire Gunn causes Illyria to revert to her monster form , memories of Fred from Spike and Wesley are transplanted into her to restore her humanity .
After the Senior Partners revert time to before the Fall , Spike begins a loosely affiliated relationship with the reformed Angel Investigations company , collaborating with Angel and his associates while maintaining independence .
Spike continues to appear in the ongoing Angel spin - off series by IDW , under the pens of Kelley Armstrong , Bill Willingham and others .
As part of its After the Fall franchise , IDW also published Bill Williams ' miniseries , Spike :
The Devil You Know ( 2010 ) , which follows Spike 's journey from Los Angeles to Las Vegas , where he acquires a spaceship and a crew of alien bugs after learning from Wolfram & Hart of a prophecy concerning the impending apocalypse ( featured in Buffy ) which has driven them to abandon this dimension .
Spike 's IDW series feeds into the " Twilight " and " Last Gleaming " arcs of Buffy Season Eight , concluding that series in 2011 .
In Season Eight , Spike and his crew come to Buffy 's aid to help prevent the end of the universe .
Due to his own research into the prophecies concerning this apocalypse , Spike is able to lead Buffy and friends to the site of the final showdown with Twilight .
When Buffy 's decision sees the world lose its magic , Spike is the only one to be emphatically supportive of the decision she had to make .
In the follow - up series Season Nine ( 2011–2013 ) , Spike bases his ship in San Francisco to be near Buffy , but eventually leaves due to the complicatedness of their relationship , setting up the miniseries Spike : A Dark Place ( 2012 ) , which follows Spike and his insectoid crew aboard his spaceship .
Dark Horse also gives the Spike title a new stylised logo , distinct from the Angel - typeface logo used prior .
The arc serves to divest Spike of the ship and crew , and sets up his 2013 crossover stint in Angel & Faith ahead of an eventual return to the main Buffy series .
In issues of Angel & Faith , Spike helps Angel defeat a demon in possession of Giles ' soul , but leaves London where they are based without hesitation when he learns that Dawn is gravely unwell back in San Francisco .
He returns to San Francisco to provide comfort to Dawn who is rapidly fading away without magic in the world to sustain her form .
However , his memories of her start to quickly fade and recordings he makes of himself talking about her turn to static .
Spike appears unconcerned he missed the chance to talk to Buffy who , along with Willow and Xander , has gone to find magic to save Dawn at the Deeper Well in England .
When nobody can remember the name of Buffy 's sister , he phones her boyfriend Xander , and also warns him that the rogue Slayer Simone Doffler has been seeking a way to become the ultimate vampire .
When the others return and Dawn is restored Buffy thanks him for staying with her sister , Spike says all that matters to him is that Dawn is safe again .
Spike continues to appear in Season Ten , in which he and Buffy finally resume their relationship , tell each other they love each other and kiss .
CHARACTERIZATION PERSONALITY Section::::Characterization .
Section::::Personality .
Spike is seen as something of a paradox amongst vampires in the series , and frequently challenges vampire conventions and limitations .
As a soulless vampire , he exhibits quite a few human traits such as love , loyalty , and aesthetic appreciation .
As an ensouled vampire , Spike 's need for violence remains unapologetically intact .
Spike 's actions are motivated by love in all of its incarnations ( love of objects , love of life , love of a specific person ) .
Drusilla does , however , make it seem that all vampires are capable of exhibiting human emotions ( such as love ) when she says to Buffy , " We can love quite well .
Though not always wisely . " Throughout the Buffy series , Spike 's character changes and develops the most out of them all .
He begins as " evil " and obsessed with Drusilla , then becomes a depressed drunk after Drusilla leaves him for a Chaos demon because he is not " demon enough " for her anymore .
He then heard about the " Gem of Amara , " a gemstone that is rumored to give vampires the ability to walk in the sun ; it was called a kind of holy grail for the vampires because it was only assumed to be real .
Spike set his sights on finding it and ended up locating it in Sunnydale .
It was taken away from him by an angry Buffy who subsequently gave it to Angel in Los Angeles .
Spike was then captured by The Initiative and was going to be used as a government science experiment .
His next character development and change was after he escaped the Initiative , realized he could not harm any human being because of the chip they put in his brain , and saw his only option as going to Buffy and the Scooby Gang for help .
Their relationship then grew slowly from a hostile tolerance to a confusing romantic relationship to a mutual respect and understanding .
Spike had setbacks along the way ; there were times when he reverted to his former " evil " self and tried to hurt Buffy or the Scoobies .
But there were also times when he showed astounding amounts of human emotion and responsibility for a supposedly " evil , " soulless creature .
Spike is also rare among vampires because he does not fear Slayers ; he seeks them out and has killed two by the time he arrives in Sunnydale .
He is proud of this accomplishment despite the fact that his victories had more to do with the Slayers ' state of mind than a special prowess on his part ( or " luck , " as he reveals in Buffy episode Fool for Love ) .
Spike admits this to an inquiring Buffy in the season 5 episode Fool for Love , and the impact of his revelation has probably not been completely felt as of the completion of season 7 .
Spike is intelligent , insightful and a skilled analyst .
His sense of humor is dry and sarcastic , and he carries himself with swagger .
Spike has a habit of pithy remarks and glib insults , even toward the few he does not view as antagonists .
Among his favorite targets are Angel , Xander , Giles , and ( to a lesser extent ) Buffy .
Joss Whedon credits this antipathy as what convinced him in the episode
" Lovers Walk " to bring Spike back as a cast regular .
As James Marsters put it , " I was supposed to be the one who stood at the side and said , ' Buffy , you 're stupid , and we 're all gon na die ' . "
Spike often nicknames people , both as insults and as terms of endearment ; for example , he calls Dawn " Little Bit " or " the Niblet " .
Spike also retains something of his literary intellect from his human side , routinely referencing poetry , songs , and literature ; on occasion he even waxes poetic on the nature of love , life , and unlife as being driven by blood , reasoning that blood is more powerful than any supernatural force because it is what separates the living from the dead .
Spike often treats his vulnerability to the sun as simply an annoying inconvenience .
He drives in broad daylight in vehicles with blacked - out windows , and on several occasions travels outside during the day using a blanket for cover .
Indeed , he has a remarkably stronger resistance to sunlight than most all other vampires seen in the series except Angel ; their elevated ability to endure the sun should not be confused with total immunity , however .
APPEARANCE Section::::Appearance .
Spike has a punk look which strongly resembles English rock musician Billy Idol ; humorously , Buffy claims that Billy Idol in fact stole his look from Spike .
His hair is peroxide blond for the duration of his time on Buffy and Angel , although in flashbacks it can be seen in its natural medium brown state as well as dyed black .
His nails are often painted black .
A Y - shaped scar on Marsters 's left eyebrow , received during a mugging , was worked into the show ; make - up artist
Todd McIntosh decided to shave out his eyebrow in order to make it more prominent .
He also included the scar on Spike 's " vamp face " prosthesis , albeit slightly altered as though the skin has stretched .
In Spike 's first appearances the wound still looks fresh , but it gradually fades until , in Angel season 5 , it is barely visible .
A flashback in " Fool for Love " reveals that Spike received the scar from the sword of the first Slayer he killed in 1900 .
Spike usually wears long black leather coats , including one that he took from a Nazi officer and another that he took as a trophy from Nikki Wood ,
the second Slayer he killed .
He wore the Slayer 's black duster for over twenty - five years .
When the coat was destroyed by a bomb from the Immortal in Italy , Spike heartbrokenly declared it to be irreplaceable ; but the Italian branch of Wolfram & Hart quickly supplied him with a whole wardrobe of new ones , nearly identical , which he happily began wearing .
His trademark look includes the leather duster , a black T - shirt or v - neck shirt and black denim pants , usually with heavy boots or Doc Martens .
He also wore a red long - sleeved shirt fairly often , particularly during the earlier seasons of Buffy , and a bright blue shirt early in Season 6 & 7 .
He explained that the shirt was supposed to show Buffy that he had changed and give him confidence ( because the First was messing with his head
and he did not want Buffy to think he was still evil or crazy ) .
But later , he returned to his trademark look , commenting that he was back .
POWERS AND ABILITIES Section::::Powers and abilities .
In addition to possessing the common powers and weaknesses of vampires , Spike 's age and experience makes him a highly effective , skilled , and versatile fighter in both armed and unarmed combat .
For example , he is able to briefly overcome Illyria during a testing of her abilities prior to her powers being greatly reduced by Wesley .
Illyria criticizes his ( and others ' ) ability to adapt , calling it " compromise . "
He is able to withstand excessive amounts of pain for extended periods of time , particularly when properly motivated , as seen in the episodes " Intervention " and " Showtime " .
While not as skilled or as sadistic as Angelus , Spike also proves himself to be effective at torture , noting he had gained " screams , various fluids , and a name " from Doctor Sparrow .
Much like Angel , he is highly proficient in various forms of martial arts , and his typical fighting style blends karate , kung fu , and others .
Spike often displays insight and skills in perception and observation , especially with regard to relationships and personalities , so long as the relationship in question does not concern him personally .
This ability allows him to wield powerful psychological weapons as easily and effectively as physical ones .
For example , when he wants to create disharmony among the Scoobies , Spike divides - and - conquers with " The Yoko Factor " , exploiting tensions that exist under the surface to alienate Buffy and her friends against each other .
Spike 's skills of analysis allowed him to realize Willow was barely holding it together after Oz 's departure even though Giles and Buffy thought she was doing better , to be the first to see through Tara 's abusive and controlling family , forced Buffy and Angel to admit that they were more than " just friends " and identify when and why some relationships , such as between Buffy and Riley , are not meant to last , masterfully feeding Riley 's insecurities in an effort to sabotage his relationship with Buffy , so Spike can pursue her .
His analytical skills and intuitive insight also help him in battle from time to time , helping him to defeat , or hold his own against , very formidable adversaries .
For example , he explains to Buffy
he was able to defeat two Slayers because he sensed and exploited their secret desires to be free of their burden .
In " Time Bomb " , he identifies Illyria 's fighting style as a Tae Kwon Do / Brazilian Capoeira / Ninjitsu hybrid .
While many vampires cling to the mannerisms and speech patterns prevalent at the time they were sired , Spike has been shown to easily adjust to changing fashions and styles over the decades and displays an impressive knowledge of both British and American popular culture , demonstrating another aspect of his potential for analysis and adaptability .
Although capable of developing sound battle strategies , Spike ( particularly in the days before receiving his chip and being re - ensouled ) often loses patience with anything more complicated than outright attack , as mentioned in the episode " In the Dark " .
He is also impatient to fight the Slayer upon his initial arrival in Sunnydale ; the attack is supposed to coincide with the Night of St. Vigeous ( when a vampire 's natural abilities are enhanced ) , but he " could n't wait " to go after the Slayer and recklessly leads a mass assault against Buffy at Sunnydale High , which fails and results in the deaths of many Aurelian vampires .
However , Spike did exercise patience throughout the later half of Buffy Season Two , when he used a wheelchair for several months after a brutal battle with the Scoobies in the episode
What 's My Line left him paraplegic .
Feigning weakness , he endured torturous weeks watching Angelus sexually pursue Dru as he waited for the right time to strike against his enemy .
Spike 's " vampire constitution " provides him with an extremely high tolerance for alcohol ( which he regularly consumes in copious quantities ) .
His experience in crime gives him skill at picking locks , hotwiring cars and picking pockets .
He is also capable of easily operating various vehicles , such as various cars , a Yamaha XJR400 motorcycle ( " Bargaining " ) , and a Winnebago ( " Spiral " ) .
He has also been shown using video game systems and a computer , treating injuries , and playing poker and pool .
Spike is also seen speaking / understanding Latin , Luganda ( a language of Uganda , where he meets the demon shaman ) , and the language of Fyarl demons , two of whom he once employed as muscle during his pre - Sunnydale days .
He is also shown to be capable of recognizing literature ; in the last episode of season five , he paraphrases a line from the St. Crispin 's Day Speech while in conversation with Giles after Buffy tells them her plan of attack on Glory .
When Spike was transformed into a ghost - like intangible state following the destruction of Sunnydale and the Hellmouth and his subsequent materialization at Wolfram & Hart , he was capable of walking through solid objects .
He was initially unable to make contact with objects around him until he learned how to focus his abilities through desire , allowing him to make brief contact with people and things if he concentrated enough .
This ability was relatively useless in a fight ; he was unable to pick up a wooden bar to hit the demon Tezcatcatl in " The Cautionary Tale of Numero Cinco " , and required a few moments to properly punch a cyborg strangling Gunn in " Lineage " .
Naturally , he lost these capabilities when he was recorporealized by Lindsey .
