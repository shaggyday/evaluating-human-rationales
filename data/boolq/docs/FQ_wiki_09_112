In February 2015 the Kevin and Bean show let go of long - time contributors , Lisa May and Boyd R. Britton ( Doc on the ROQ ) .
May started as a traffic reporter on the program and had grown to become a key contributor of the Kevin and Bean Show during her 24 years with the program , while Doc had been providing the news for 27 years .
Kevin and Bean explained that management had made it clear audiences were not tuning in to KROQ for traffic or news , so the painful decision was made to make changes to the show .
