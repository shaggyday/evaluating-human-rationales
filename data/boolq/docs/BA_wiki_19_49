PONTIAC FIREBIRD
The Pontiac Firebird is an American automobile built by Pontiac from the 1967 to the 2002 model years .
Designed as a pony car to compete with the Ford Mustang , it was introduced February 23 , 1967 , the same model year as GM 's Chevrolet division platform - sharing Camaro .
This also coincided with the release of the 1967 Mercury Cougar , Ford 's upscale , platform - sharing version of the Mustang ,
The name " Firebird " was also previously used by GM for the General Motors Firebird 1950s and early 1960s concept cars .
FIRST GENERATION ( 1967–1969 )
Section::::First generation ( 1967–1969 ) .
The first generation Firebird had characteristic Coke bottle styling shared with its cousin , the Chevrolet Camaro .
Announcing a Pontiac styling trend , the Firebird 's bumpers were integrated into the design of the front end , giving it a more streamlined look than the Camaro .
The Firebird 's rear " slit " taillights were inspired by the 1966–1967 Pontiac GTO .
Both a two - door hardtop and a convertible were offered through the 1969 model year .
Originally , the car was a " consolation prize " for Pontiac , which had desired to produce a two - seat sports car based on its original Banshee concept car .
However , GM feared this would cut into Chevrolet Corvette sales , and gave Pontiac a piece of the " pony car " market through sharing the F - body platform with Chevrolet .
The 1967 base model Firebird came equipped with the Pontiac SOHC inline - six .
Based on the standard Chevrolet inline - six , it was fitted with a single - barrel carburetor and rated at .
The " Sprint " model six came with a four - barrel carburetor , developing .
Most buyers opted for one of three V8s : the with a two - barrel carburetor producing ; the four - barrel " HO " ( high output ) 326 , producing ; or the from the GTO .
All 1967–1968 400 CI engines had throttle restrictors that blocked the carburetors ' second barrels from fully opening .
A " Ram Air " option was also available , providing functional hood scoops , higher flow heads with stronger valve springs , and a hotter camshaft .
Power for the Ram Air package was the same as the conventional 400 HO , but peaked at 5,200 RPM .
The engines were subsequently replaced in 1968 by the Chevrolet stroked engines , the first developing an increased using a single - barrel carburetor , and the other the same 215hp with a four - barrel carburetor .
Also for the 1968 model , the engine was replaced by the Pontiac V8 , which actually displaced , and produced with a two - barrel carburetor .
An HO version of the with a revised cam was also offered starting in that year , which developed .
Power output of the other engines was increased marginally .
There was an additional Ram Air IV option for the V8 engines during 1969 , complementing the Ram Air III ; these generated at 5000 rpm and of torque at 3400 rpm ; and respectively .
The HO engine was revised again with a different cam and cylinder heads resulting in .
During 1969 a special engine was designed for SCCA road racing applications that was not available in production cars .
The styling difference from the 1967 to the 1968 model was the addition of federally - mandated side marker lights : for the front of the car , the turn signals were made larger and extended to wrap around the front edges of the car , and on the rear , the Pontiac ( V - shaped )
Arrowhead logo was added to each side .
The front door vent - windows were replaced with a single pane of glass and Astro Ventilation , a fresh - air - inlet system .
The 1969 model received a major facelift with a new front end design but unlike the GTO , it did not have the Endura bumper .
The instrument panel and steering wheel were revised .
The ignition switch was moved from the dashboard to the steering column with the introduction of GM 's new locking ignition switch / steering wheel .
In March 1969 , a $ 1083 optional handling package called the " Trans Am performance and appearance package " , UPC " WS4 " , named after the Trans Am Series ENGINES Section::::Engines . 1967

SECOND GENERATION ( 1970–1981 )
Section::::Second generation ( 1970–1981 ) .
The second generation debut for the 1970 model year was delayed until February 26 , 1970 , because of tooling and engineering problems ; thus , its popular designation as a 1970½ model , while leftover 1969s were listed in early Pontiac literature without a model - year identification .
This generation of Firebirds were available in coupe form only ; after the 1969 model year , convertibles were not available until 1991 .

Replacing the " Coke bottle " styling was a more " swoopy " body style , while still retaining some traditional elements .
The top of the rear window line going almost straight down to the lip of the trunk lid , a look that was to epitomize F - body styling for the longest period during the Firebird 's lifetime .
The new design was initially characterized with a large C - pillar , until 1975 when the rear window was enlarged .
1970 Section::::1970 .
There were two Ram Air engines for 1970 : the L74 Ram Air III ( in GTO ) and the LS1 Ram Air IV 1971 Section::::1971 .
The Pontiac engine 1972 Section::::1972 .
During a 1972 strike , the Firebird ( and the similar F - body Camaro ) were nearly dropped .
Again the 455HO was the only engine available for the Trans Am .
Starting in 1972 , and continuing until 1977 , the Firebird was only produced at the Norwood , Ohio 1973 Section::::1973 .
Actual production cars yielded 1/4 mile results in the high 14 to 15.0 second/98 MPH range ( sources : Motor Trend Magazine , July ' 73 and Roger Huntington 's book , American Supercar ) – results that are consistent with a 3,850 pound car ( plus driver ) and the engine equipped with a 4-barrel Rochester Quadrajet carburetor rated at a maximum power of at 4000 rpm and a maximum torque of at 3600 rpm figure .
An original rating of SAE net had been assigned to the SD-455 , though that rating was based on the emissions non - compliant " pre - production " engines , as mentioned above .
That rating appeared in published 1973 model year Pontiac literature , which had been printed prior to the " pre - production " engines " barely passing " emissions testing , and the last minute switch to what became the production engine .
The 1974 model year production literature listed the specifications of the production engine ( 290 SAE net horsepower ) .
In 1973 and 1974 , a special version of the 455 , called the Super Duty 455 ( SD-455 ) , was offered .
The SD-455 consisted of a strengthened cylinder block that included four - bolt main bearings and added material in various locations for improved strength .
Original plans called for a forged crankshaft , although actual production SD455s received nodular iron crankshafts with minor enhancements .
Forged rods and forged aluminum pistons were specified , as were unique high - flow cylinder heads .
A production line stock SD455 produced 253 rear wheel HP on a chassis dyno , as reported by High Performance Pontiac magazine ( January , 2007 ) .
This is also consistent with the 290 SAE net horsepower factory rating ( as measured at the crankshaft ) .
Skip McCully verified that no production SD455s released to the public were fitted with the 480737 cam .
When asked about the compromises for the production SD455 engine , McCully responded , " Compression , camshaft , jetting , and vacuum advance . "
He followed by stating that he would have preferred a compression ratio 1974 Section::::1974 .
Curb weights rose dramatically in the 1974 model year due to the implementation of telescoping bumpers and various other crash and safety related structural enhancements ; SD455 Trans Ams weighed in at in their first year of production ( 1974 model year ; actually 1973 ) .
The 1974 models featured a redesigned " shovel - nose " front end and new wide " slotted " taillights .
In 1974 , Pontiac offered two base engines for the Firebird : a inline-6 and a V8 .
Available were V8 engines , as well as the produced , while the SD-455 produced .
The 400 , 455 , and SD-455 engines were offered in the Trans Am and Formula models during 1974 .
A 1974 Firebird was driven by Jim Rockford in the pilot movie and the first season ( 1974 - 1975 ) of The Rockford Files , and every following season , Rockford would change to the next model year .
However , in the sixth season ( 1979 - 1980 ) , Rockford continued to drive the 1978 Firebird from season 5 , as James Garner 1975 1976 Section::::1976 .
Pontiac celebrated its 50th anniversary year in 1976 .
To commemorate this event , Pontiac unveiled a special Trans Am option at the 1976 Chicago Auto Show .
Painted in black with gold accents , this was the first " anniversary " Trans Am package and the first production black and gold special edition .
A removable T - top developed by Hurst 1977 Section::::1977 .
A distinctive , slant - nose facelift occurred in 1977 .
There is a way to tell an early 1977 built car as there was a production change in the hood scoop .
Early cars were supplied with an off - center scoop .
Furthermore , early W72 cars came with the standard 180 hp air cleaner .
Pontiac offered the T / A with a single 4-barrel Rochester Quadrajet carburetor RPO W72 rated at at 3600 rpm and a maximum torque of at 2400 rpm , as opposed to the regular 6.6 Litre 400 ( RPO L78 ) rated at .
The T / A 6.6 equipped engines had chrome valve covers , while the base 400 engines had painted valve covers .
In addition , California and high - altitude cars received the Olds 403 engine , which offered a slightly higher compression ratio and a more usable torque band than the Pontiac engines of 1977 .
From 1977 to 1981 , the Firebird used four square headlamps , while the Camaro continued to retain the two round headlights that had been shared by both second generation designs .
The 1977 Trans - Am Special Edition became famous after being featured in Smokey and the Bandit .
The 1980 Turbo model was used for Smokey and the Bandit II 1978 1979 1980
Section::::1980 .
In 1980 , due to ever - increasing emissions restrictions , Pontiac dropped all of its large displacement engines .
1980 therefore saw the biggest engine changes for the Trans Am .
The 301 , offered in 1979 as a credit option , was now the standard engine .
Options included a turbocharged 301 or the Chevrolet 305 1981 Section::::1981 .
In the final year of the second generation Firebirds ( 1981 ) , Trans Am still used the same engines as it had in the previous model year , with the only change being the addition of a new electronic carburetion system .
The assembly plant code for Norwood
, OH is " N " ( from 1972 to 1980 this would be the fifth VIN digit , for 1981 it is the 11th digit ) , and for Van Nuys , CA it is " L " ( for Los Angeles , of which Van Nuys , Los Angeles ENGINES Section::::Engines .

hp THIRD GENERATION ( 1982–1992 )
Section::::Third generation ( 1982–1992 ) .
The availability and cost of gasoline ( two fuel crises had occurred by this time ) meant the weight and the fuel consumption of the 3rd generation had to be considered in the design .
In F - body development , both the third generation Firebird and Camaro were proposed as possible front wheel drive platforms , but the idea was scrapped .
The state of the art of computerized engine management was in its infancy , and as long as saving fuel was the primary objective , it was not possible to have high horsepower and torque numbers .
They did manage to cut enough weight from the design so that acceleration performance would be better than the 1981 models .
They also succeeded in the fuel consumption department , offering a four - cylinder Firebird that would provide 34 miles per gallon .
GM executives decided that engineering effort would best be spent on aerodynamics and chassis development .
They created a modern platform , so that when engine technology advanced , they would have a well - balanced package with acceleration , braking , handling , and aerodynamics .
For the time being , they would have world class aerodynamics and handling , and excellent fuel economy .
The Firebird and Camaro were completely redesigned for the 1982 model year , with the windshield slope set at 62 degrees , ( about three degrees steeper than anything GM had ever tried before ) , and for the first time , a large , glass - dominated hatchback that required no metal structure to support it .
Two concealed pop - up headlights , a first on the F - Body cars , were the primary characteristic that distinguished the third generation Firebird from both its Camaro sibling and its prior form ( a styling characteristic carried into the fourth generation 's design ) .
In addition to being about lighter than the previous design , the new design was the most aerodynamic product GM had ever released .
Wind tunnels were used to form the new F - Body platform 's shape , and Pontiac took full advantage of it .
The aerodynamic developments extended to the finned aluminum wheels with smooth hubcaps and a functional rear spoiler .

FOURTH GENERATION ( 1993–2002 )
Section::::Fourth generation ( 1993–2002 ) .
The fourth - generation Firebird amplified the aerodynamic styling initiated by the previous generation .
While the live rear axle and floorpan aft of the front seats remained largely the same , ninety percent of the Firebird 's parts were all - new .
Overall , the styling of the Firebird more strongly reflected the Banshee IV concept car than the 1991 " facelift " did .
As with the Camaro , major improvements included standard dual airbags , four - wheel anti - lock brakes , 16-inch wheels , rack - and - pinion power steering , short / long - arm front suspension , and several non - rusting composite body panels .
Throughout its fourth generation , trim levels included V6-powered Firebird , and V8-powered Formula and Trans Am .
The T5 five - speed manual transmission was standard with the V6s , as was the Borg - Warner T56 six - speed manual for the V8s .
A four - speed automatic was optional for both , featuring built - in electronic controls beginning in 1994 .
1993 - 1997 Section::::1993 - 1997 .
From 1993 until 1995 ( 1995 non - California cars ) , Firebirds received a 3.4 L V6 , an enhanced version of the third - generation 's 3.1 L V6 .
Beginning mid - year 1995 onward , a Series II 3.8 L V6 with became the Firebird 's sole engine .
From 1993 to 1997 , the sole engine for the Formula and Trans Am was the 5.7 L LT1 V8 , essentially identical to the LT1 in the C4 Corvette except for more flow - restrictive intake and exhaust systems .
Steering wheel audio controls were included with optional uplevel cassette or compact disc stereo systems .
Beginning with 1994 model year cars , " Delco 2001"-series stereo systems replaced the previous Delco units .
This revised series , also introduced for other Pontiac car lines , featured ergonomically - designed control panels with larger buttons and an optional seven - band graphic equalizer .
Also in 1994 , the fourth - generation convertible was available ; every Firebird ( and Camaro ) convertible featured a glass rear window with a built - in electric defroster .
The 1995 models were the same as those of previous years , but traction control ( ASR : acceleration slip regulation ) was available for LT1 Firebirds , controlled by a switch on the console .
The steering wheels in all Firebirds was also changed ; their optional built - in audio controls were more closely grouped on each side .
The " Trans Am GT " trim level was dropped from the lineup after its model year run in 1994 .
For 1995 , all Trans Ams received 155-mph speedometers and Z - rated tires .
1995 was also the first year of the vented version of the Opti - Spark distributors on LT1 F - cars , addressing a common mechanical fault with the unit .
The ' transmission perform ' button was available only in the 1994 and 1995 Formula and Trans Am .
This option was stopped for the 1996 and later models , but the connections remain for 1996 and 1997 Formula and Trans Am .
While 1995 cars still used the OBD - I ( on - board diagnostic ) computer system ( the last year of F - body to use OBD - I ) , a majority of them had OBD - II connector ports under the dash .
Firebird performance levels improved for 1996 , with the establishment of the stronger 200-hp 3.8 L V6 as the new base engine , and the power rating of the LT1 increased to 285 for 1996 , due to its new dual catalytic - converter exhaust system .
1996 was also the first model year of the OBD - II computer system .
Optional performance enhancements were available for each Firebird trim level ; the Y87 performance packages for V6s added mechanical features of the V8 setups , such as four - wheel disc brakes , faster - response steering , limited - slip rear differential , and dual tailpipes .
For Formulas and Trans Ams , functional dual - inlet " Ram Air " hoods returned as part of the WS6 performance package .
The optional package boosted rated horsepower from 285 to 305 , and torque from 325 lb·ft to 335 .
Also included were 17 " x 9 " wheels with 275/40ZR17 tires , suspension improvements , oval dual tailpipe tips , and a WS6 badge .
Bilstein shocks were a further option with the package .
The 1997 model year introduced standard air conditioning , daytime running lamps ( utilizing the front turnsignal lamps ) , digital odometers , and optional 500-watt Monsoon cassette or compact disc stereo systems to all Firebird trim levels .
For V6 Firebirds , a W68 sport appearance package was also introduced as a counterpart to the Camaro RS trim level .
The WS6 " Ram Air " performance package was now also an option for the Formula and Trans Am convertibles , although these convertibles did not receive the 17-inch wheel - and - tire combination .
There were 41 Formula convertibles and 463 Trans Am convertibles produced from 1996 to 1997 with the WS6 package .
1998–2002
Section::::1998–2002 .
In 1997 , in relation to the Camaro , the Firebird received a mid - cycle refresh for 1998 model year .
Major changes included a new hood and front fascia with dual intakes , retracting quad halogen headlights , circular turnsignal and fog lamps , a front license plate pocket , lower fender air vents , unified - style lower door raised lettering for each trim level , and a new " honeycomb " rear light panel , with circular reverse lamps .
In the dashboard , " next generation " reduced - force dual airbags became standard .
As before , the Formula and Trans Am again received a close derivative of the Corvette 's 5.7 L V8 , the LS1 of the C5 Corvette , as the LT1 ( and LT4 ) V8s were discontinued .
The LS1 Firebirds were also equipped with an aluminum driveshaft , replacing the previous steel version , while all Firebird trim levels gained four - wheel disc brakes with dual - piston front calipers and larger rotors at each wheel , complete with a solenoid - based Bosch anti - lock system .
The Formula convertible was no longer offered .
Beginning in 1998 for 1999 models , a standard 16.8-gallon non - metallic fuel tank increased potential traveling range .
GM 's ASR traction control system was extended to the V6-powered Firebirds , and all LS1 ( V8 ) and Y87 ( V6 )
Firebirds also received a Zexel / Torsen II slip - reduction rear axle .
An electronic brakeforce distribution ( EBD ) system replaced the old hydraulic proportioning valve for improved brake performance .
An enhanced sensing and diagnostic module ( SDM ) recorded vehicle speed , engine rpm , throttle position and brake use in the last five seconds prior to airbag deployment .
In 1999 , a Hurst shifter for variants with the 6-speed manual and a power steering cooler became options for LS1 Firebirds .
In 2000 , the WS6 performance package was available exclusively for 2001 model year Trans Am coupe and convertible variants .
For 2002 , more convenience items such as power mirrors and power antenna became standard equipment , while cassette stereos were phased out .
SPECIAL EDITIONS
Section::::Special editions .
Firehawk
The special - edition extra - performance Firehawk ( available in Formula trim for 1993–1997 , and again in both Formula and Trans Am trims for 1999 - 2002 ) was produced by SLP Engineering , Inc. , and sold through Pontiac dealerships .
Featuring 17-inch wheels with namesake Firestone Firehawk 275/40ZR17 tires along with a functional twin - inlet hood above a specific air cleaner box , its rated power increased to 300 hp ( 220 kW ) and 330 lb·ft ( 445 Nm ) of torque .
A total of 201 Firehawks were built for 1993 .
In 1994 , the Firehawk package was expanded to include options for a suspension upgrade as well as a larger - diameter exhaust system that could boost power to 315 hp .
T - top Formula coupes and convertibles could also be optioned as Firehawks beginning in 1995 .
For 1996 and 1997 , the Firehawk gained rectangular driving lights mounted inside the front scoops and ( except Firehawk convertibles )
the Trans Am 's elevated rear wing .
In 1997 , an LT4 Firehawk was also available , utilizing the same 330 hp , balanced - and - blueprinted LT4 V8 engine as found in the manual - transmission 1996 Corvette .
A total of 29 LT4-powered Firehawks were produced .
Power levels for the 1999 Firehawk , powered by the LS1 V8 , rose to 327 hp ( 330 in 2000 , 335 in 2001 , and 345 in late 2002 models equipped with the " Blackwing " intake ) .
A 10th - anniversary Firehawk was available in 2001 , distinguished as a black Trans Am coupe with gold - painted hood stripes , gold 17-inch wheels , and gold tailpipe tips .
1994
Trans Am GT
In 1994 only , a " Trans Am GT " option was available .
Trans Am GTs did not receive any special badging , graphics , or emblems , and looked externally identical to the base Trans Am cars .
The GT package included 245/50ZR16 tires and a 155-mph speedometer .
Non - GT optioned Trans Ams in 1994 received 235/55R16 tires , a 115-mph speedometer , and a much lower top - speed limiter .
The " highrise spoiler " , leather , and T - tops were not standard on the Trans Am GT cars in 1994 , nor any year of LT1 Trans Am .
RPO code T43 " uplevel spoiler " was an option on all Trans Ams , and while the mass majority of 1994 Trans Am GT cars received the T43 spoiler ( along with the majority of all 1993-'97 Trans Ams ) , it was not part of the Trans Am GT package .
Both base Trans Ams and Trans am GTs could be ordered as coupe , T - top , or convertible versions and were both available with automatic or manual transmissions .
While the GT package was a cost option on the 1994 Trans Am , a majority of 1994 Trans Ams were made with the GT package .
All of the 1994
Trans Am GT options became standard in 1995 - 2002 as part of the Trans Am package , and the GT name / package was dropped for 1995 .
Some of the early fourth - generation Trans Am and Formula Firebirds list " GT " on the vehicle 's title or registration .
The reason behind this is because the VIN does not specify a " package " ( Formula , Trans Am , Trans Am GT , Firehawk , etc . ) ; it only specifies the engine ( 5.7L V8 LT1 ) .
Because the title is based on the VIN alone , titles and registrations often list all of the packages , but it does not mean the car is equipped with any certain package .
1994
25th - Anniversary Trans Am
The 1994 model year marked the 25th anniversary of the Trans Am , and another anniversary edition was released , painted white with a single dark blue stripe down the center of the vehicle that was reminiscent of the 1970 Trans Am .
It also featured white - painted , five - spoke , 16-inch alloy wheels , and white leather seats and door trim .
This edition was available in either coupe or convertible form .
1999

FIREBIRD TRANS AM
Section::::Firebird Trans Am .
The Trans Am was a specialty package for the Firebird , typically upgrading handling , suspension , and horsepower , as well as minor appearance modifications such as exclusive hoods , spoilers , fog lights and wheels .
Four distinct generations were produced between 1969 and 2002 .
These cars were built on the F - body platform , which was also shared by the Chevrolet Camaro .
Despite its name , the Trans Am was not initially used in the Trans Am Series , as its smallest engine exceeded the SCCA 's five liter displacement limit .
The second generation was available from 1970 to 1981 and was featured in the 1977 movie Smokey and the Bandit , the 1978 movie Hooper , the 1979 movie Rocky II , and the 1980 movie Smokey and the Bandit II .
The Firebird Trans Am was also selected as the Official Pace Car for the 1980 Indianapolis 500 .
The third generation , available from 1982 to 1992 , was featured in the 1983 movie Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 and the 1984 movie Alphabet City .
KITT , the automotive star , and its evil twin counterpart KARR , of the popular 1980s TV series Knight Rider , was a modified third - generation Trans Am .
The fourth - generation Trans Am , available from model years 1993 to 2002 , offered between .
The fictional character Dwight Schrute from NBC 's show The Office , is another famous driver of the 1987 model .
The Trans Am GTA ( Gran Turismo Americano ) was an options package available on the Firebird Trans Am which added gold 16-inch diamond - spoke alloy wheels , a mono - chromatic paint scheme and special cloisonné GTA badges .
The GTA ( along with the Formula model that was intended to fill the gap between the base model Firebird and mid - level Trans Am ) was the brainchild of former Pontiac marketing manager Lou Wassel .
It was intended to be the " ultimate " Trans Am and was the most expensive Firebird available .
The GTA equipment package officially went on sale in 1987 and avoided a gas - guzzler tax thanks to its lightweight PW 16-inch gold cross - lace wheels .
The high - performance WS6 suspension package was also re - tuned to offer a more compliant ride while still maintaining tight handling characteristics .
Engine choices consisted of a L98 5.7 liter ( 350 ci )
TPI V8 mated to GM 's corporate 700R4 automatic transmission or the 5.0 liter ( 305 ci ) TPI V8 .
A five - speed manual was available but was mated to the 5.0 liter only .
The GTA trim level was available from 1987 through the 1992 model year .
For 1989 , the 20th anniversary turbo Trans Am project ( originally conceived by Bill Owen of Pontiac ) was outsourced to PAS , Inc. , an engineering firm led by Jeff Beitzel .
Beitzel and his team did most of the TTA development work .
The 3.8 liter turbocharged V6 engines were built by PAS at their 40,000 square foot City of Industry , CA plant .
From there , they went to GM 's plant in Van Nuys , CA to be installed into GTAs on the F - Body assembly line .
The cars were then shipped back to PAS for final assembly , testing , and quality control .
Incidentally , the GTA chassis were selected at random , thus there is no correlation between the VIN and production sequence number .
The initial number of cars to be produced had ranged from 500 to 2,500 until GM finally settled on 1,500 .
In all , a total of 1,555 Turbo Trans Ams were manufactured .
One of these served as the 1989 Indianapolis 500 pace car .
The 2002 model - year
WS6 Trans Am produced 325 horsepower at 5,200 rpm and 350 lb - ft of torque at 4,000 rpm out of its 5.7-liter LS1 V8 engine .
A completely - stock WS6 completed the ¼—mile in 13.16 seconds at 106.05 mph on Eagle F1 street tires .

RACING Section::::Racing .
Firebirds were used in the Trans - Am series in the 1960s and 1970s .
When the Firebird Trans Am was released , there was controversy over the model 's inability to compete in the Trans - Am because the smallest available engine was too large for use in the series at 400 cubic inches ( 6.6 liters ) .
The name also caused controversy because it was used without permission from the SCCA , who threatened suit .
GM settled the dispute by paying $ 5 to the SCCA for each car they sold .
When the Trans - Am was last seen , model year 2002 Firebirds were in use .
From 1996 to 2006 , a WS6 Trans Am coupe provided the body style for the mechanically identical racing cars used in the International Race of Champions ( IROC ) .
During the 1995 , 1996 , and 1997 NHRA seasons , 14-time funny car champion John Force used a Firebird body to replace the obsolete Oldsmobile Cutlass and Chevrolet Lumina bodies he had used since 1988 .
He used it for three seasons , winning the championship in all three years .
The Firebird was also used by drivers such as Del Worsham , Tim Wilkerson , Frank Pedregon , and Jerry Toliver .
The Firebird body also replaced the Oldsmobile Cutlass in the pro stock class in 1995 , forcing drivers Warren Johnson , Jerry Eckman , and Mark Pawuk to replace their body styles for the 1996 year .
None of them would win with the first year of the Firebird body , but pro stock driver Jim Yates , a second year driver , using the Firebird body , did .
