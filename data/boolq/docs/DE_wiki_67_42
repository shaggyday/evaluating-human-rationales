SALT WATER CHLORINATION Salt water chlorination is a process that uses dissolved salt ( 2,500–6,000 ppm ) as a store for the chlorination system .
The chlorine generator ( also known as salt cell , salt generator , salt chlorinator or SWG ) uses electrolysis in the presence of dissolved salt ( NaCl ) to produce hypochlorous acid ( HClO ) and sodium hypochlorite ( NaClO ) , which are the sanitizing agents already commonly used in swimming pools .
As such , a saltwater pool is not actually chlorine - free ; it simply utilizes added salt and a chlorine generator instead of direct addition of chlorine .
DISTINCTION FROM TRADITIONAL POOL CHLORINATION Section::::Distinction from traditional pool chlorination .
The presence of chlorine in traditional swimming pools can be described as a combination of free available chlorine ( FAC ) and combined available chlorine ( CAC ) .
While FAC is composed of the free chlorine that is available for sanitizing the water , the CAC includes chloramines , which are formed by the reaction of FAC with amines ( introduced into the pool by human perspiration , saliva , mucus , urine , and other biologics ) .
Chloramines are responsible for the " chlorine smell " of pools , as well as skin and eye irritation .
These problems are the result of insufficient levels of free available chlorine , and indicate a pool that must be " shocked " by the addition of 5 - 10 times the normal amount of chlorine .
In saltwater pools , the generator uses electrolysis to continuously produce free chlorine .
It also burns off chloramines in the same manner as traditional shock ( oxidizer ) .
As with traditionally chlorinated pools , saltwater pools must be monitored in order to maintain proper water chemistry .
Low chlorine levels can be caused by insufficient salt , incorrect ( low ) chlorine - generation setting on the SWG unit , higher - than - normal chlorine demand , low stabilizer , sun exposure , insufficient pump speed , or mechanical issues with the chlorine generator .
Salt count can be lowered due to splash - out , backwashing , and dilution via rainwater .
HEALTH CONCERNS
Section::::Health concerns .
Research has shown that because saltwater pools still use chlorine sanitization , they generate the same disinfection byproducts ( DBPs ) that are present in traditional pools .
Of highest concern are haloketones and trihalomethanes ( THMs ) of those the predominant form being bromoform .
Very high levels of bromoform - up to 1.3 mg / liter or 13 times the guideline values of World Health Organization - have been found in some public saltwater swimming pools .
Manufacturers have been producing saltwater chlorine generators in the United States since the early 1980s , and they first appeared commercially in New Zealand in the early 1970s ( the Aquatech IG4500 ) .
OPERATION Section::::Operation .
The chlorinator cell consists of parallel titanium plates coated with ruthenium and sometimes iridium .
Older models make use of perforated ( or mesh ) plates rather than solid plates .
Electrolysis naturally attracts calcium and other minerals to the plates .
Thus , depending on water chemistry and magnitude of use , the cell will require periodic cleaning in a mild acid solution ( 1 part HCl to 15 parts pool water ) which will remove the buildup of calcium compound crystals , such as calcium carbonate or calcium nitrate .
Excessive buildup can reduce the effectiveness of the cell .
Running the chlorinator for long periods with not enough salt in the pool can strip the coating off the cell which then requires an expensive replacement , as can using too strong an acid wash .
Saltwater pools can also require stabilizer ( cyanuric acid ) to help stop the sun 's UV rays from breaking down free chlorine in the pool .
Usual levels are 20 – 50 ppm .
They also require the pH to be kept between 7.2 and 7.8 with the chlorine being more effective if the pH is kept closer to 7.2 .
The average salt levels are usually in the 3000 - 5000 ppm range , much less than the ocean , which has salt levels of around 35,000 ppm .
In swimming pools , salt is typically poured across the bottom and swept with the pool brush until it dissolves ; if concentrated brine is allowed into the return - water system it can cause the chlorinator cell to malfunction due to overconductivity .
Salt water chlorination produces an excess of hydroxyl ions whilst releasing chlorine from salt , which makes the pool alkaline ( sodium hydroxide , NaOH , caustic soda ) .
This requires the frequent addition of hydrochloric acid ( HCl , also known as muriatic acid ) to neutralise the alkalinity and convert the sodium hydroxide back into sodium chloride ( i.e. table salt ) , which can be split by electrolysis again .
Thus the consumable supplying all the chlorine is in fact the hydrochloric acid , with the salt acting as a non - consumed intermediary , being split and reformed .
The whole process is exactly balanced by equivalents : the amount of chlorine produced is directly related to the amount of hydrochloric acid used , other things remaining equal .
This could be represented roughly as follows ( with the ions all separated in solution ) :
Use of another acid , such as sulphuric acid to neutralise pool alkalinity will reduce the pH but will produce sulphate ions rather than chloride ions .
Sulphate ions conduct electricity equally well as chloride at the electrode , but will not produce any chlorine .
A salt water pool " poisoned " with sulphate may have to be drained and refilled to remove the offending sulphate ions .
BENEFITS AND DISADVANTAGES Section::::Benefits and disadvantages .
The benefits of salt systems in pools are the convenience and the constant delivery of pure chlorine - based sanitizer .
The reduction of irritating chloramines versus traditional chlorinating methods and the " softening " effect of electrolysis reducing dissolved alkali minerals in the water are also perceived as benefits .
For some people that have sensitivities to chlorine , these systems may be less offensive .
Salt water pools are cheaper to maintain throughout the year , since salt is significantly cheaper than the commercial chlorines .
Disadvantages are the initial cost of the system , maintenance , and the cost of replacement cells .
Salt is corrosive and will damage some metals and some improperly - sealed stone .
However , as the ideal saline concentration of a salt - chlorinated pool is very low ( < 3,500ppm , the threshold for human perception of salt by taste ; seawater is about ten times this concentration ) , damage usually occurs due to improperly - maintained pool chemistry or improper maintenance of the electrolytic cell .
Pool equipment manufacturers typically will not warrant stainless steel products damaged by saline pools .
Calcium and other alkali precipitate buildup will occur naturally on the cathode plate , and sometimes in the pool itself as " scaling " .
Regular maintenance of the cell is necessary ; failure to do so will reduce the effectiveness of the cell .
Certain designs of saline chlorinators use a " reverse - polarity " design that will regularly switch the roles of the two electrodes between anode and cathode , causing this calcium buildup to dissolve off the accumulating electrode .
Such systems reduce , but do not eliminate , the need to clean the electrolytic cell and the occurrence of calcium scale in the water .
As chlorine is generated , pH will rise causing the chlorine to be less effective .
Many systems with chemistry automation can sense the rising pH and automatically introduce either CO2 or hydrochloric acid in order to bring the pH back to the target level .
Automation systems will also manage levels of sanitizer by monitoring the ORP or redox levels of the water .
This allows only the needed amount of chlorine to be generated based on the demand .
Sodium bromide can be used instead of sodium chloride , which produces a bromine pool .
The benefits and downsides are the same as those of a salt system .
It is not necessary to use a chloride - based acid to balance the pH. Also , bromine is only effective as a sanitizer , not as an oxidizer , leaving a need for adding a " shock " such as hydrogen peroxide or any chlorine - based shock to burn off inorganic waste and free up combined bromines .
This extra step is not needed in a sodium chloride system , as chlorine is effective as both a sanitizer and an oxidizer .
A user would only need to " super chlorinate " or increase chlorine production of the cell occasionally .
That would normally be once a week or after heavy bather loads .
