TOYOTA RAV4
The is a compact crossover SUV ( sport utility vehicle ) produced by the Japanese automobile manufacturer Toyota .
This was the first compact crossover SUV ; it made its debut in Japan and Europe in 1994 , and in North America in 1995 .
The vehicle was designed for consumers wanting a vehicle that had most of the benefits of SUVs , such as increased cargo room , higher visibility , and the option of full - time four - wheel drive , along with the maneuverability and fuel economy of a compact car .
Although not all RAV4s are four - wheel - drive , RAV4 stands for " Recreational Activity Vehicle :
4-wheel drive " , because the aforementioned equipment is an option in select countries .

In the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety ( IIHS ) evaluations , the 2013 and 2014 model year RAV4 achieved a " good " crashworthiness rating for head restraints and seats , roof strength , side , and moderate overlap front , while achieving a " poor " rating in the IIHS Small Overlap Frontal Test .
Modifications were made starting in the 2015 model year which increased the small overlap front rating to " good " .
The small overlap test , introduced in 2012 by the IIHS , simulates a frontal collision on 25 percent of the driver 's side .
Since its adoption , the IIHS has noticed several automakers making non - symmetrical modifications to their vehicles , including the RAV4 .
Another small overlap test was conducted on a number of vehicles , including a 2015 RAV4 , but was conducted on the passenger side instead .
The RAV4 fared the worst and would have received a " poor " rating if the IIHS were to provide ratings for passenger - side protection .
The crash test 's intrusion was further into the vehicle on the passenger 's side than on the driver 's side and caused the passenger door to open during the crash .
RAV4 ADVENTURE AND RAV4 PREMIUM ( 2013 )
Section::::RAV4 Adventure and RAV4 Premium ( 2013 ) .
