GAMECUBE CONTROLLER
The GameCube controller is the standard controller for Nintendo 's GameCube video game console .
OVERVIEW Section::::Overview .
Released alongside the GameCube console , the standard GameCube controller has a wing grip design .
This controller was bundled with all new GameCube systems throughout the console 's life cycle and was also available separately .
It connects to the console 's controller ports via a 2 m/6.5 ft cable .
The standard GameCube controller provides haptic feedback by way of a built - in rumble motor rather than using an external Rumble Pak add - on like the Nintendo 64 controller .
Also unlike its predecessor , this controller does not feature any expansion capabilities .
The controller features a total of six digital buttons , two analog sticks , a d - pad and two hybrid analog triggers / digital buttons .
The primary analog stick is on the left , with the D - pad below it .
The four face buttons are on the right of the controller ( a large green " A " button in the center , a smaller red " B " button to its bottom left and two kidney - shaped buttons ; " X " to the right and a " Y " to the top ) with a yellow " C " stick below those .
A Start / Pause button is located in the middle of the controller .
On the " shoulders " of the controller there are two analog triggers marked " L " and " R , " as well as one digital button marked " Z " which sits above the " R " trigger .
The " L " and " R " triggers feature both analog and digital capabilities .
Each of these behaves as a typical analog trigger until fully depressed , at which point the button " clicks " to register an additional digital signal .
This method effectively serves to provide two functions per button without actually adding two separate physical buttons .

CONTROLLER Section::::WaveBird wireless controller .
The WaveBird wireless controller is an RF - based wireless controller based on the same design as the standard controller .
It communicates with the GameCube system wirelessly through a receiver dongle connected to one of the system 's controller ports .
It is powered by two AA batteries .
As a power - conservation measure , the WaveBird lacks the rumble function of the standard controller .
LODGENET CONTROLLER Section::::LodgeNet controller .
A specially - designed variation of the GameCube controller was created for the LodgeNet in some North American hotels .
The controller can be used for pay - per - play access to select GameCube titles .
In addition to the standard GameCube controller inputs , the LodgeNet controller features six additional buttons which are used to control the on - screen game selection interface .
The controller can not be used on regular home systems .
AVAILABILITY Section::::Availability .
Official controllers are becoming scarce at retailers , as a result of increased demand of the controller due to the Wii 's backward compatibility with GameCube games and the fact that several Wii games support the controller as a primary method of control .
In response to the regained popularity , Nintendo decided to re - launch the Gamecube controller .
WHITE CONTROLLER Section::::White controller .
In April 2008 , Nintendo released a white GameCube controller , exclusive to Japan .
The controller has not been released outside Japan , but online retailers such as Amazon.com and Play - Asia do import and sell the controller internationally .
It differs from previous editions in that it features a white cable which is 3 m ( 9.8 ft ) long , rather than the 2 m ( 6.5 ft ) black cable used on standard controllers .
In 2014 , the manufacturing production of the white controller was resumed under the Super Smash Bros. branding , again exclusively for Japan ( see more info on the Super Smash Bros. edition below ) .
CONTINUED PRODUCTION OF
PLATINUM CONTROLLER Section::::Continued production of platinum controller .
Nintendo of America continued to sell wired platinum controllers up until early 2012 in North America , but have since sold out .
It is unknown if they will ever go through another production run .
SUPER SMASH BROS .
FOR WII U EDITION CONTROLLER Section::::Super Smash Bros. for Wii U Edition controller .
The Super Smash Bros. edition controller was released in 2014 , in conjunction with the release of Super Smash Bros. for Wii U.
The controller features a metallic silver
Super Smash Bros. logo surrounded by flames instead of the Nintendo GameCube logo .
It comes in standard black worldwide , although a white version was released in Japan only .
These controllers have much longer cables than the original controllers .
Along with the release of the controller , Nintendo released a GameCube controller adapter for the Wii
U.
The adapter supports four GameCube controllers , and all original pads are supported .
A second adapter can be hooked up to a console , allowing up to eight players to use a GameCube controller .
The adapter is only officially compatible with Super Smash Bros. for Wii U ; no other games allow its use , although some homebrew software is compatible with the adapter and allows it to be used on other games .
SUPER SMASH
BROS .
ULTIMATE EDITION
CONTROLLER
Section::::Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Edition controller .
During the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018 , Nintendo confirmed it is re - issuing the black GameCube controller for use with Super Smash Bros. Ultimate for the Nintendo Switch as the game officially supports the controller ( in docked mode only , though it is still possible to play in tabletop mode via adapter ) like its Wii and Wii U predecessors .
The re - issued controller was released on November 2 , 2018 , and will feature a simplified variant Super Smash Bros. emblem design .
On the same day , Nintendo will also re - issue the official USB GameCube controller adapter , with a generic Nintendo embossed branding unlike the first edition that featured the Wii U logo .
The Nintendo Switch itself and some of its games is technically capable of supporting the GameCube controller in docked mode ( it can also be played in tabletop mode via HORI 's Multiport USB Playstand ) after a system update issued in October 2017 .
USE ON SUBSEQUENT CONSOLES Section::::Use on subsequent consoles .
Due to the Wii 's ability to use GameCube controller input , all official GameCube controllers may be used on the Wii .
GameCube software played on the Wii requires the use of a GameCube controller ( and , for games with save data , a memory card ) , and can not be played with standard Wii controllers .
Wii software can be programmed to make full use of GameCube controllers .
Nearly all Virtual Console games and certain Wii and WiiWare games have been designed to support GameCube controllers as input .
However , some later Wii models , such as the Wii Family Edition and Wii Mini , lack support for GameCube software , controllers , and memory cards .
Although the follow - up console , the Wii U , also omits compatibility with GameCube software and hardware , Nintendo announced that an official adapter would be released that allows players to connect up to four GameCube controllers to the Wii U via its USB ports .
Though its initial product listing stated it would be compatible with any Wii U title that supports the Wii U Pro Controller , Nintendo since corrected the listing , stating the adapter can only be used with Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and would not be compatible with other Wii U or Wii software .
The adapter launched alongside the game in November 2014 , both separately and as part of a bundle with the game .
Support for the adapter on Nintendo Switch was introduced via its 4.0 firmware update ; unlike the Wii U , it is supported by any game , although functionality may be affected if a game 's bindings utilize buttons not found on the GameCube controller .
REPLICATIONS Section::::Replications .
Accessory maker PDP began releasing a line of officially licensed " Wired Fight Pad " controllers for the Wii and Wii U in 2014 , with color schemes based on various Nintendo characters .
They are based on the design and layout of the GameCube controller , but are connected via the Wii Remote 's expansion port and act identically to a Classic Controller Pro ( thus supporting any Wii and Wii U game that supports the Classic Controller Pro , but not GameCube games ) .
To provide parity with the Classic Controller Pro , these controllers feature dual shoulder buttons , as well as the " + " , " − " , and " Home " buttons that the GameCube controller lacks .
The smaller C - stick is also replaced with the larger Hori released a similar product line known as the " Battle Pad " .
In anticipation of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate , both Hori and PDP unveiled similar replications as USB gamepads for Nintendo Switch .
As with their Wii U counterparts , they maintain similar designs to the standard GameCube controllers , but updated to include dual shoulder buttons and Switch system keys .
LEGAL ISSUES Section::::Legal issues .
Anascape Ltd , a Texas - based firm , filed a lawsuit against Nintendo for patent infringements regarding Nintendo 's controllers .
A July 2008 verdict found that a ban would be issued preventing Nintendo from selling the regular GameCube and WaveBird controllers in the United States .
Nintendo was free to continue selling the controllers pending an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit .
On April 13 , 2010 , Nintendo won the appeal and the previous court decision was reversed .
