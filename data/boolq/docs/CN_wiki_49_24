HIP FLASK
A hip flask is a thin flask for holding a distilled beverage .
DESCRIPTION Section::::Description .
Hip flasks were traditionally made of pewter , silver , or even glass , though most modern flasks are made from stainless steel .
Some modern flasks are made of plastic so as to avoid detection by metal detectors .
Hip flasks can vary in shape , although they are usually contoured to match the curve of the wearer 's hip or thigh for comfort and discretion in a design also known as a kidney flask .
Some flasks have " captive tops " which is a small arm that attaches the top to the flask in order to stop it from getting lost when it is taken off .
A hip flask is most commonly purchased empty and then filled by the owner .
However , the term " flask " also applies to smallest bottle sizes of alcohol in commercial markets .
Some flasks come with small cups to make sharing easier , although generally liquid is consumed directly from the flask .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Similar to wrist watches the hip flask began to appear in the form it is recognized today in the 18th century , initially used by members of the gentry .
However , less compact versions had been in production for several centuries .
Notably , in the Middle Ages , there are several accounts of gutted fruit being used to store liquor .
During the 18th century , women boarding docked British warships would smuggle gin into the ship via makeshift flasks , created from pig 's bladders and hidden inside their petticoats .
Following the act of prohibition in 1920s America , the state of Indiana banned the sale of cocktail shakers and hip flasks .
Antique hip flasks , particularly those made of silver , are now sought - after collector 's items .
In the Royal Air Force , " hip - flask " was used as code for a revolver .
LEGALITY Section::::Legality .
Carrying a hip flask filled with alcohol in a public place is illegal in many locations in the United States due to open container laws .
These laws prohibit possession of an unsealed container of alcohol in public or within the passenger compartment of a vehicle .

POPULAR CULTURE Section::::In
popular culture .
The hip flask appears frequently in comedy , in part because it allows drinking in inappropriate situations where a bottle would not normally be found — for instance , in Two and a Half Men , where Charlie Harper ( Charlie Sheen ) drinks alcohol from a hip flask during a funeral .
It also appears rarely in The Simpsons , when Homer drinks from it on occasion , and even allows Bart to take a drink during particularly intolerable occasions .
In Family Guy , the character Brian Griffin also carries around a hip flask in the earlier seasons .
In another adult animation , Rick and Morty , the character Rick Sanchez , who is shown to be notably alcoholic , carries a hip flask under his lab coat .
