GALÁPAGOS ISLANDS
The Galápagos Islands ( official name : , other Spanish name : , ) , part of the Republic of Ecuador , are an archipelago of volcanic islands distributed on either side of the equator in the Pacific Ocean surrounding the centre of the Western Hemisphere , west of continental Ecuador .
The islands are known for their large number of endemic species and were studied by Charles Darwin during the second voyage of HMS Beagle .
His observations and collections contributed to the inception of Darwin 's theory of evolution by means of natural selection .
The Galápagos Islands and their surrounding waters form the Galápagos Province of Ecuador , the Galápagos National Park , and the Galápagos Marine Reserve .
The principal language on the islands is Spanish .
The islands have a population of slightly over 25,000 .
The first recorded visit to the islands happened by chance in 1535 , when Fray Tomás de Berlanga , the Bishop of Panamá , was surprised with this undiscovered land during a voyage to Peru to arbitrate in a dispute between Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro .
De Berlanga eventually returned to the Spanish Empire and described the conditions of the islands and the animals that inhabited them .
The group of islands was shown and named in Abraham Ortelius 's atlas published in 1570 .
The first crude map of the islands was made in 1684 by the buccaneer Ambrose Cowley , who named the individual islands after some of his fellow pirates or after British royalty and noblemen .
These names were used in the authoritative navigation charts of the islands prepared during the Beagle survey under captain Robert FitzRoy , and in Darwin 's popular book The Voyage of the Beagle .
The new Republic of Ecuador took the islands from Spanish ownership in 1832 , and subsequently gave them official Spanish names .
The older names remained in use in English - language publications , including Herman Melville 's The Encantadas of 1854 .
GEOLOGY
Section::::Geology .
Volcanism has been continuous on the Galápagos Islands for at least 20 myr , and perhaps even longer .
The mantle plume beneath the east - ward moving Nazca Plate ( 51 km / myr ) has given rise to a 3-kilometre - thick platform under the island chain and seamounts .
Besides the Galápagos Archipelago , other key tectonic features in the region include the Northern Galápagos Volcanic Province between the archipelago and the Galápagos Spreading Center ( GSC ) 200 km to the north at the boundary of the Nazca Plate and the Cocos Plate .
This spreading center truncates into the East Pacific Rise on the west and is bounded by the Cocos Ridge and Carnegie Ridge in the east .
Furthermore , the Galápagos Hotspot is at the northern boundary of the Pacific Large Low Shear Velocity Province while the Easter Hotspot is on the southern boundary .
The Galápagos Archipelago is characterized by numerous contemporaneous volcanoes , some with plume magma sources , others from the asthenosphere , possibly due to the young and thin oceanic crust .
The GSC caused structural weaknesses in this thin lithosphere leading to eruptions forming the Galápagos Platform .
Fernandina and Isabela in particular are aligned along these weaknesses .
Lacking a well - defined rift zone , the islands have a high rate of inflation prior to eruption .
Sierra Negra on Isabela Island experienced a 240 cm uplift between 1992 and 1998 , most recent eruption in 2005 , while Fernandina on Fernandina Island indicated an uplift of 90 cm , most recent eruption in 2009 .
Alcedo on Isabela Island had an uplift of greater than 90 cm , most recent eruption in 1993 .
Additional characteristics of the Galápagos Archipelago are closer volcano spacing , smaller volcano sizes , and larger calderas .
For instance , Isabela Island includes 6 major volcanoes , Ecuador , Wolf , Darwin , Alcedo , Sierra Negraa and Cerro Azul , with most recent eruptions ranging from 1813 to 2008 .
The neighboring islands of Santiago and Fernandina last erupted in 1906 and 2009 , respectively .
Overall , the 9 active volcanoes in the archipelago have erupted 24 times between 1961 and 2011 .
The shape of these volcanoes is that of an " overturned soup bowl " as opposed to the " overturned saucer plate " of the Hawaiian Islands .
The Galápagos 's shape is due to the pattern of radial and circumferential fissure , radial on the flanks , but circumferential near the caldera summits .
It is the circumferential fissures which give rise to stacks of short lava flows .
The volcanoes at the west end of the archipelago are in general , taller , younger , have well developed calderas , and are mostly composed of tholeiitic basalt , while those on the east are shorter , older , lack calderas , and have a more diverse composition .
The ages of the islands , from west to east are 0.05 Ma for Fernandina , 0.65 Ma for Isabela , 1.10 Ma for Santiago , 1.7 Ma for Santa Cruz , 2.90 Ma for Santa Fe , and 3.2 Ma for San Cristobal .
The calderas on Sierra Negra and Alcedo have active fault systems .
The Sierra Negra fault is associated with a sill 2 km below the caldera .
The caldera on Fernandina experienced the largest basaltic volcano collapse in history , with the 1968 phreatomagmatic eruption .
Fernandina has also been the most active volcano since 1790 , with recent eruptions in 1991 , 1995 , 2005 , and 2009 , and the entire surface has been covered in numerous flows since 4.3 Ka .
The western volcanoes have numerous tuff cones .
PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
Section::::Physical geography .
The islands are located in the eastern Pacific Ocean , off the west coast of South America .
The closest land mass is that of mainland Ecuador , the country to which they belong , to the east .
The islands are found at the coordinates 1 °
40'N–1 ° 36 'S ,
89 ° 16'–92 ° 01'W. Straddling the equator , islands in the chain are located in both the northern and southern hemispheres , with Volcán Wolf and Volcán Ecuador on Isla Isabela being directly on the equator .
Española Island , the southernmost islet of the archipelago , and Darwin Island , the northernmost one , are spread out over a distance of .
The International Hydrographic Organization ( IHO ) considers them wholly within the South Pacific Ocean , however .
The Galápagos Archipelago consists of of land spread over of ocean .
The largest of the islands , Isabela , measures and makes up close to three - quarters of the total land area of the Galápagos .
Volcán Wolf on Isabela is the highest point , with an elevation of above sea level .
The group consists of 18 main islands , 3 smaller islands , and 107 rocks and islets .
The islands are located at the Galapagos Triple Junction .
The archipelago is located on the Nazca Plate ( a tectonic plate ) , which is moving east / southeast , diving under the South American Plate at a rate of about per year .
It is also atop the Galápagos hotspot , a place where the Earth 's crust is being melted from below by a mantle plume , creating volcanoes .
The first islands formed here at least 8 million and possibly up to 90 million years ago .
While the older islands have disappeared below the sea as they moved away from the mantle plume , the youngest islands , Isabela and Fernandina , are still being formed .
In April 2009 , lava from the volcanic island
Fernandina started flowing both towards the island 's shoreline and into the center caldera .
In late June 2018 , Sierra Negra , one of five volcanoes on Isabela and one of the most active in the Galapagos archipelago , began erupting for the first time since 2005 .
Lava flows made their way to the coastline , prompting the evacuation of about fifty nearby residents and restricting tourist access .
MAIN ISLANDS Section::::Main islands .
The 18 main islands ( each having a land area at least 1 km ) of the archipelago ( with their English names ) shown alphabetically :
* Baltra ( South Seymour ) Island – Baltra is a small flat island located near the centre of the Galápagos .
It was created by geological uplift .
The island is very arid , and vegetation consists of salt bushes , prickly pear cacti and palo santo trees .
Until 1986 , Baltra ( Seymour ) Airport was the only airport serving the Galápagos .
Now , there are two airports which receive flights from the continent ; the other is located on San Cristóbal Island .
Private planes flying to Galápagos must fly to Baltra , as it is the only airport with facilities for planes overnight .
On arriving in Baltra , all visitors are immediately transported by bus to one of two docks .
The first dock is located in a small bay , where the boats cruising Galápagos await passengers .
The second is a ferry dock , which connects Baltra to the island of Santa Cruz .
During the 1940s , scientists decided to move 70 of Baltra 's land iguanas to the neighboring North Seymour Island as part of an experiment .
This move proved unexpectedly useful when the native iguanas became extinct on Baltra as a result of the island 's military occupation in World War II .
During the 1980s , iguanas from North Seymour were brought to the Charles Darwin Research Station as part of a breeding and repopulation project , and in the 1990s , land iguanas were reintroduced to Baltra .
As of 1997 , scientists counted 97 iguanas living on Baltra ; 13 of which had hatched on the islands .
* Bartolomé ( Bartholomew ) Island – Bartolomé Island is a volcanic islet just off the east coast of Santiago Island in the Galápagos Islands group .
it is one of the " younger " islands in the Galápagos archipelago .
This island , and neighbouring Sulivan Bay on Santiago ( James ) island , are named after lifelong friend of Charles Darwin , Sir Bartholomew James Sulivan , who was a lieutenant aboard HMS Beagle .
Today Sulivan Bay is often misspelled Sullivan Bay .

Española is the oldest island at around 3.5 million years , and the southernmost in the group .
Due to its remote location , Española has a large number of endemic species .
It has its own species of lava lizard , mockingbird , and Galápagos tortoise .
Española 's marine iguanas exhibit a distinctive red coloration change between the breeding season .
Española is the only place where the waved albatross nests .
Some of the birds have attempted to breed on Genovesa ( Tower ) Island , but unsuccessfully .
Española 's steep cliffs serve as the perfect runways for these birds , which take off for their ocean feeding grounds near the mainland of Ecuador and Peru .
Española has two visitor sites .
Gardner Bay is a swimming and snorkelling site , and offers a great beach .
Punta Suarez has migrant , resident , and endemic wildlife , including brightly colored marine iguanas , Española lava lizards , hood mockingbirds , swallow - tailed gulls , blue - footed boobies , Nazca boobies , red - billed tropicbirds , Galápagos hawks , three species of Darwin 's finches , and the waved albatross .

Fernandina has an area of and a maximum altitude of .
This is the youngest and westernmost island .
On 13 May 2005 , a new , very eruptive process began on this island , when an ash and water vapor cloud rose to a height of and lava flows descended the slopes of the volcano on the way to the sea .
Punta Espinosa is a narrow stretch of land where hundreds of marine iguanas gather , largely on black lava rocks .
The famous flightless cormorants inhabit this island , as do Galápagos penguins , pelicans , Galápagos sea lions and Galápagos fur seals .
Different types of lava flows can be compared , and the mangrove forests can be observed .
* Floreana ( Charles or Santa María ) Island – It was named after Juan José Flores , the first President of Ecuador , during whose administration the government of Ecuador took possession of the archipelago .
It is also called Santa Maria , after one of the caravels of Columbus .
It has an area of and a maximum elevation of .
It is one of the islands with the most interesting human history , and one of the earliest to be inhabited .
Flamingos and green sea turtles nest ( December to May ) on this island .
The patapegada or Galápagos petrel , a sea bird which spends most of its life away from land , is found here .
At Post Office Bay , where 19th - century whalers kept a wooden barrel that served as a post office , mail could be picked up and delivered to its destinations , mainly Europe and the United States , by ships on their way home .
At the " Devil 's Crown " , an underwater volcanic cone and coral formations are found .
* Genovesa ( Tower ) Island –
The name is derived from Genoa , Italy , the birthplace of Christopher Columbus .
It has an area of and a maximum altitude of .
This island is formed by the remaining edge of a large caldera that is submerged .
Its nickname of " the bird island " is clearly justified .
At Darwin Bay , frigatebirds and swallow - tailed gulls , the only nocturnal species of gull in the world , can be seen .
Red - footed boobies , noddy terns , lava gulls , tropic birds , doves , storm petrels and Darwin finches are also in sight .
Prince Philip 's Steps is a bird - watching plateau with Nazca and red - footed boobies .
There is a large Palo Santo forest .
* Isabela ( Albemarle ) Island – This island was named in honor of Queen Isabela .
With an area of , it is the largest island of the Galápagos .
Its highest point is Volcán Wolf , with an altitude of .
The island 's seahorse shape is the product of the merging of six large volcanoes into a single land mass .
On this island , Galápagos penguins , flightless cormorants , marine iguanas , pelicans and Sally Lightfoot crabs abound .
At the skirts and calderas of the volcanoes of Isabela , land iguanas and Galápagos tortoises can be observed , as well as Darwin finches , Galápagos hawks , Galápagos doves and very interesting lowland vegetation .
The third - largest human settlement of the archipelago , Puerto Villamil , is located at the southeastern tip of the island .
It is the only island to have the equator run across it .
It is also the only place in the world where a penguin can be in its natural habitat in the Northern Hemisphere .
* Marchena ( Bindloe ) Island – Named after Fray Antonio Marchena , it has an area of and a maximum altitude of .
Galapagos hawks and sea lions inhabit this island , and it is home to the Marchena lava lizard , an endemic animal .

Pinta Island was home to the last remaining Pinta tortoise , called Lonesome George .
He was moved from Pinta Island to the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island , where scientists attempted to breed from him .
However , Lonesome George died in June 2012 without producing any offspring .
* Rábida ( Jervis ) Island – It bears the name of the convent of Rábida , where Columbus left his son during his voyage to the Americas .
It has an area of and a maximum altitude of .
The high amount of iron contained in the lava at Rábida
gives it a distinctive red colour .
White - cheeked pintail ducks live in a saltwater lagoon close to the beach , where brown pelicans and boobies have built their nests .
Until recently , flamingos were also found in the lagoon , but they have since moved on to other islands , likely due to a lack of food on Rábida .
Nine species of finches have been reported in this island .
* San Cristóbal ( Chatham ) Island – It bears the name of the patron saint of seafarers , " St. Christopher " .
Its English name was given after William Pitt , 1st Earl of Chatham .

Herman Melville devotes the third and fourth sketches of The Encantadas to describing this islet ( which he calls " Rock Rodondo " ) and the view from it .
CLIMATE Section::::Climate .
Although the islands are located on the equator , the Humboldt Current brings cold water to them , causing frequent drizzles during most of the year .
The weather is periodically influenced by the El Niño events , which occur about every 3 to 7 years and are characterized by warm sea surface temperatures , a rise in sea level , greater wave action , and a depletion of nutrients in the water .
During the season known as the garúa ( June to November ) , the temperature by the sea is , a steady and cold wind blows from south and southeast , frequent drizzles ( garúas )
last most of the day , and dense fog conceals the islands .
During the warm season ( December to May ) , the average sea and air temperature rises to , there is no wind at all , there are sporadic , though strong , rains and the sun shines .
Weather changes as altitude increases in the large islands .
Temperature decreases gradually with altitude , while precipitation increases due to the condensation of moisture in clouds on the slopes .
There is a large range in precipitation from one place to another , not only with altitude , but also depending on the location of the islands , and also with the seasons .
The following table corresponding to the wet 1969 shows the variation of precipitation in different places of Santa Cruz Island : !
Location !
Charles DarwinStation !
Devine Farm !
Media Luna !
Altitude ! 6 m !
320 m !
620 m
The precipitation also depends on the geographical location .
During March 1969 , the precipitation over Charles Darwin Station , on the southern coast of Santa Cruz was , while on Baltra Island , the precipitation during the same month was only .
This is because Baltra is located behind Santa Cruz with respect to the prevailing southerly winds , so most of the moisture gets precipitated in the Santa Cruz highlands .
There are significant changes in precipitation from one year to another , too .
At Charles Darwin Station , the precipitation during March 1969 was , but during March 1970 , it was only .
On the larger islands , the pattern of generally wet highlands and drier lowlands impacts the flora .
The vegetation in the highlands tends to be green and lush , with tropical woodland in places .
The lowland areas tend to have arid and semi - arid vegetation , with many thorny shrubs and cacti , and almost bare volcanic rock elsewhere .
HISTORY PRE - COLUMBIAN ERA Section::::History . Section::::Pre - Columbian era .
According to a 1952 study by Thor Heyerdahl and Arne Skjølsvold , remains of potsherds and other artifacts from several sites on the islands suggest visitation by South American peoples in pre - Columbian era .
The group located an Inca flute and shards from more than 130 pieces of ceramics , which were later identified as pre - Incan .
However , no remains of graves , ceremonial vessels and constructions have ever been found , suggesting no permanent settlement occurred before the Spanish arrived in the 16th century .
It is not clear who the first visitors to the islands were , but they were probably sailors blown off course or people on hapless fishing boats blown out to sea .
Most of them were likely unimpressed by the lack of fresh water on the islands .
Whether the Incas ever made it here is disputed ; in 1572 , Spanish chronicler Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa claimed that Topa Inca Yupanqui , the second Sapa Inca of the Inca Empire had visited the archipelago , but there is little evidence for this , and many experts consider it a far - fetched legend , especially since the Incas were not seafaring people .
EUROPEAN VOYAGES
Section::::European voyages .
European discovery of the Galápagos Islands occurred when Spaniard Fray Tomás de Berlanga , the fourth Bishop of Panama , sailed to Peru to settle a dispute between Francisco Pizarro and his lieutenants .
De Berlanga 's vessel drifted off course when the winds diminished , and his party reached the islands on 10 March 1535 .
The Galápagos Islands first appeared on the maps of Gerardus Mercator and Abraham Ortelius , in about 1570 .
The islands were named " Insulae de los Galopegos " ( Islands of the Tortoises ) in reference to the giant tortoises found there .
The first English captain to visit the Galápagos Islands was Richard Hawkins , in 1593 .
Until the early 19th century , the archipelago was often used as a hideout by mostly English pirates who attacked Spanish galleons carrying gold and silver from South America to Spain .
In 1793 , James Colnett described the flora and fauna of Galápagos , and suggested the islands could be used as base for the whalers operating in the Pacific Ocean .
He drew the first accurate navigation charts of the islands .
Whalers and maritime fur traders killed and captured thousands of the Galápagos tortoises to extract their fat .
The tortoises could be kept on board ship as a means of providing of fresh protein , as these animals could survive for several months on board without any food or water .
The hunting of the tortoises was responsible for greatly diminishing , and in some cases eliminating , certain species .
Along with whalers came the fur - seal hunters , who brought the population of this animal close to extinction .
The first known permanent human resident on Galápagos was Patrick Watkins , an Irish sailor who was marooned on the Island Floreana from 1807 to 1809 .
According to later accounts , Watkins managed to survive by hunting , growing vegetables and trading with visiting whalers , before finally stealing an open boat and navigating to Guayaquil .
In 1818 the Nantucket whaleship Globe , under Captain George Washington Gardner , discovered a " mother lode " of sperm whales some thousand miles west of the South American coast approximately at the equator .
He returned to Nantucket in 1820 with more than 2000 barrels of sperm whale oil and the news of his discovery .
This led to an influx of whaleships to exploit the new whaling ground and the Galápagos Islands became a frequent stop for the whalers both before and after visiting what came to be known as the Offshore Grounds .
This led to the establishment in the Galápagos Islands of a kind of unofficial " post office " where whaleships stopped to pick up and drop off letters as well as for provisioning and repairing .
In October 1820 , the whaleship Essex , out of Nantucket , stopped at the Galápagos for these purposes on its way to the Offshore Grounds .
On what was then known as Charles Island , while most of the crew were hunting tortoises one crewmember , English boatsteerer Thomas Chappel , for reasons still unclear , lit a fire which quickly burned out of control .
Some of the tortoise hunters had a narrow escape and had to run a gauntlet of fire to get back to the ship .
Soon almost the entire island was in flames .
Crewmembers reported that after a day of sailing away they could still see the flames against the horizon .
One crewmember who returned to the Galápagos several years afterward described the entire island as still a blackened wasteland .
ECUADORIAN GALÁPAGOS Section::::Ecuadorian Galápagos .
Ecuador annexed the Galápagos Islands on 12 February 1832 , naming them the Archipelago of Ecuador .
This new name added to several names that had been , and are still , used to refer to the archipelago .
The first governor of Galápagos , General José de Villamil , brought a group of convicts to populate the island of Floreana , and in October 1832 , some artisans and farmers joined them .
The voyage of the Beagle brought the survey ship HMS Beagle , under captain Robert FitzRoy , to the Galápagos on 15 September 1835 to survey approaches to harbours .
The captain and others on board , including his companion , the young naturalist Charles Darwin , made observations on the geology and biology on Chatham , Charles , Albemarle and James islands before they left on 20 October to continue on their round - the - world expedition .
Primarily a geologist at the time , Darwin was impressed by the quantity of volcanic craters they saw , later referring to the archipelago as " that land of craters .
"
His study of several volcanic formations over the 5 weeks he stayed in the islands , led to several important geological discoveries , including the first , correct explanation for how volcanic tuff is formed .
Darwin noticed the mockingbirds differed between islands , though he thought the birds now known as Darwin 's finches were unrelated to each other , and did not bother labelling them by island .
Nicholas Lawson , acting Governor of Galápagos for the Republic of the Equator , met them on Charles Island , and as they walked to the prison colony , Lawson told Darwin the tortoises differed from island to island .
Towards the end of the voyage , Darwin speculated that the distribution of the mockingbirds and the tortoises might " undermine the stability of Species " .
When specimens of birds were analyzed on his return to England , it was found that many apparently different kinds of birds were species of finches , which were unique to islands .
These facts were crucial in Darwin 's development of his theory of natural selection explaining evolution , which was presented in On the Origin of Species .
José Valdizán and Manuel Julián Cobos tried a new colonization , beginning the exploitation of a type of lichen found in the islands ( Roccella portentosa ) used as a coloring agent .
After the assassination of Valdizán by some of his workers , Cobos brought from the continent a group of more than a hundred workers to San Cristóbal Island , and tried his luck at planting sugar cane .
He ruled his plantation with an iron hand , which led to his assassination in 1904 .
In 1897 , Antonio Gil began another plantation on Isabela Island .
Over the course of a whole year , from September 1904 , an expedition of the Academy of Sciences of California , led by Rollo Beck , stayed in the Galápagos collecting scientific material on geology , entomology , ornithology , botany , zoology and herpetology .
Another expedition from that Academy was done in 1932 ( Templeton Crocker Expedition ) to collect insects , fish , shells , fossils , birds and plants .
For a long time during the early 1900s and at least through 1929 , a cash - strapped Ecuador had reached out for potential buyers of the islands to alleviate financial troubles at home .
The US had repeatedly expressed its interest in buying the islands for military use as they were positioned strategically guarding the Panama Canal .
Besides the United States , Japan , Germany and Chile also expressed interest in establishing bases in the islands at the turn of the century .
Chile had previously acquired the Straits of Magellan and Easter Island for strategic reasons and lieutenant Gregorio Santa Cruz argued in 1903 that possessing an island in equatorial waters , like the Galápagos , would be of great benefit since the geopolitical situation of Chile was expected to drastically change when the Panama Canal opened .
Another benefit would be to widen the security radius of Chile .
In the 1920s and 1930s , a small wave of European settlers arrived in the islands .
There occurred a series of unsolved disappearances on the island of Floreana in the 1930s among the largely European expatriate residents at the time .
The Galápagos Affair :
Satan Came to Eden is a 2013 feature - length documentary film about the same .
Ecuadorian laws provided all colonists with the possibility of receiving twenty hectares each of free land , the right to maintain their citizenship , freedom from taxation for the first ten years in Galápagos , and the right to hunt and fish freely on all uninhabited islands where they might settle .
The first European colonists to arrive were Norwegians who settled briefly on Floreana , before moving on to San Cristobal and Santa Cruz .
A few years later , other colonists from Europe , America and Ecuador started arriving on the islands , seeking a simpler life .
Descendants of the Norwegian Kastdalen family and the German Angermeyer still live on the islands .
During World War II , Ecuador authorized the United States to establish a naval base in Baltra Island , and radar stations in other strategic locations .
Baltra was established as a United States Army Air Force base .
Baltra was given the name of " Beta Base " along with " Alpha Base " in Nicaragua and " Gamma Base " in Salinas ( continental Ecuador ) .
The Crews stationed at Baltra and the aforementioned locations established a geographic triangle of protection in charge of patrolling the Pacific for enemy submarines , and also provided protection for the Panama Canal .
After the war , the facilities were given to the government of Ecuador .
Today , the island continues as an official Ecuadorian military base .
The foundations and other remains of the US base can still be seen as one crosses the island .
In 1946 , a penal colony was established in Isabela Island , but it was suspended in 1959 .
The Galápagos became a national park in 1959 , and tourism started in the 1960s , imposing several restrictions upon the human population already living on the island .
However , opportunities in the tourism , fishing , and farming industries attracted a mass of poor fishermen and farmers from mainland Ecuador .
In the 1990s and 2000s , violent confrontations between parts of the local population and the Galápagos National Park Service occurred , including capturing and killing giant tortoises and holding staff of the Galápagos National Park Service hostage to obtain higher annual sea cucumber quotas .
POLITICS Section::::Politics .
The islands are administered by a provincial government .
It was made a province by presidential decree by President Guillermo Rodríguez Lara on 18 February 1973 .
The province is divided into cantons , each covering certain islands .
The capital is Puerto Baquerizo Moreno .
DEMOGRAPHICS Section::::Demographics .
The largest ethnic group is composed of Ecuadorian Mestizos , the mixed descendants of Spanish colonists and indigenous Native Americans , who arrived mainly in the last century from the continental part of Ecuador .
Some descendants of the early European and American colonists on the islands also still remain on the islands .
In 1959 , approximately 1,000 to 2,000 people called the islands their home .
In 1972 a census in the archipelago recorded a population of 3,488 .
By the 1980s , this number had risen to more than 15,000 people , and in 2010 there were 25,124 people in the Galápagos .
Five of the islands are inhabited : Baltra , Floreana , Isabela , San Cristóbal and Santa Cruz .
TRAVEL Section::::Travel .
Options for flying into the Galápagos are limited to two islands : San Cristobal ( San Cristóbal Airport ) and Baltra ( Seymour Airport ) .
Private aircraft must use Baltra as it is the airport equipped with overnight plane accommodations .
Seymour Airport on Baltra was recently renovated ( 2012–2013 ) to accommodate larger planes .
Until 1969 the only way to visit was on a private or chartered vessel .
There was no regular air service until Forrest Nelson 's Hotel Galápagos began the first organized tours in April 1969 .
Soon other travel companies brought in tour ships and yachts , and local fishermen began converting their wooden boats for rudimentary cruising with guests .
These vessels were the main source of overnight accommodations in the Galápagos .
Today there are about 85 yachts and ships equipped for overnight guests .
In 2006 the Baltra military governed island , was opened up to limited overnight camping .
Baltra also requires permits by the military government for overnight stays on the beach .
Other inhabited islands also allow camping on the beaches designated as " recreational " use to the locals .
All of these camping permits are limited to number of people and nights , with most nights not to exceed three .
Land based hotels are opening on the inhabited islands of San Cristobal , Santa Cruz , Floreana and Isabela .
By 2012 , more than half the visitors to Galápagos made their tours using day boats and these small hotels .
Restaurants , easy access and economy make this an attractive travel option .
The cruise tours are still the best way to see all the complex environment and wildlife of the islands .
There are only 116 visitor sites in the Galápagos : 54 land sites and 62 scuba - diving or snorkeling sites .
Small groups are allowed to visit in 2- to 4-hour shifts only , to limit impact on the area .
All groups are accompanied by licensed guides .
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION POLICY Section::::Environmental protection policy .
Though the first protective legislation for the Galápagos was enacted in 1930 and supplemented in 1936 , it was not until the late 1950s that positive action was taken to control what was happening to the native flora and fauna .
In 1955 , the International Union for the Conservation of Nature organized a fact - finding mission to the Galápagos .
Two years later , in 1957 , UNESCO , in cooperation with the government of Ecuador , sent another expedition to study the conservation situation and choose a site for a research station .
In 1959 , the centenary year of Charles Darwin 's publication of The Origin of Species , the Ecuadorian government declared 97.5 % of the archipelago 's land area a national park , excepting areas already colonised .
The Charles Darwin Foundation ( CDF ) was founded the same year .
The core responsibility of CDF , an international nongovernmental organization ( NGO ) constituted in Belgium , is to conduct research and provide the research findings to the government for effective management of Galápagos .
CDF 's research efforts began with the establishment of the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island in 1964 .
During the early years , conservation programs , such as eradication of introduced species and protection of native species , were carried out by research station personnel .
Now much of that work is accomplished by the Galápagos National Park Service using the research findings and methodologies developed by CDF .
In 1986 , the 70,000 square kilometers ( 27,000 sq mi ) of ocean surrounding the islands was declared a marine reserve , second in size only to Australia 's Great Barrier Reef .
In 1990 , the archipelago became a whale sanctuary .
UNESCO recognised the islands in 1978 as a World Heritage Site and in 1985 , as a biosphere reserve .
This was later extended in December 2001 to include the marine reserve .
In July 2010 , the World Heritage Committee agreed to remove the Galápagos Islands from its list of precious sites endangered by environmental threats or overuse .
Noteworthy species include : * Galápagos land iguanas , Conolophus spp .
* Marine iguana , Amblyrhynchus cristatus , the only iguana feeding in the sea
* Galápagos tortoise ( Galápagos giant tortoise ) , Chelonoidis nigra , known as galápago in Spanish
, it gave the name to the islands
* Galápagos green turtle , Chelonia mydas agassisi , a subspecies of the green turtle * Sea cucumbers , the cause of environmental battles with fishermen over quotas of this expensive Asian delicacy * Flightless cormorant , Phalacrocorax harrisi * Great frigatebird and magnificent frigatebird * Blue - footed booby , Sula nebouxii , popular among visitors for their large blue feet which they show off in courtship * Galápagos penguin , Spheniscus mendiculus , the only living tropical penguin * Waved albatross , Phoebastria irrorata , the only living tropical albatross * Galápagos hawk , Buteo galapagoensis , the islands ' main scavenger ( at the top of the food chain ) and " environmental police "
* Four endemic species of Galápagos mockingbirds , the first species Darwin noticed to vary from island to island
* Thirteen endemic species of tanagers , popularly called Darwin 's finches .
Among them is the sharp - beaked ground finch Geospiza difficilis septentrionalis which is sometimes called the " vampire finch " for its blood - sucking habits , and the tool - using woodpecker finch , Camarhynchus pallidus * Galápagos sea lions , Zalophus wollebaeki , closely related to the California sea lion , but smaller * Two endemic genera of cacti , each with a single species :
Jasminocereus thouarsii , the candelabra cactus , and Brachycereus nesioticus , the lava cactus ENVIRONMENTAL THREATS
Section::::Environmental threats .
Introduced plants and animals , such as feral goats , cats , and cattle , brought accidentally or willingly to the islands by humans , represent the main threat to Galápagos .
Quick to reproduce and with no natural predators , these alien species decimated the habitats of native species .
The native animals , lacking natural predators on the islands , are defenseless to introduced predators .
There are over 700 introduced plant species today .
There are only 500 native and endemic species .
This difference is creating a major problem for the islands and the natural species that inhabit them .
These plants have invaded large areas and eliminated endemic species in the humid zones of San Cristobal , Floreana , Isabela and Santa Cruz .
Some of the most harmful introduced plants are the guayaba or guava ( Psidium guajava ) ,
avocado ( Persea americana ) , cascarilla ( Cinchona pubescens ) , balsa ( Ochroma pyramidale ) , hill raspberry ( Rubus niveus ) , various citrus ( orange , grapefruit , lemon ) , floripondio , higuerilla ( Ricinus communis ) trees and the elephant grass , Pennisetum purpureum .
Many species were introduced to the Galápagos by pirates .
Thor Heyerdahl quoted documents that mention the Viceroy of Peru , knowing that British pirates ate the goats that they themselves had released in the islands , ordered dogs to be freed there to eliminate the goats .
Also , when colonization of Floreana by José de Villamil failed , he ordered the goats , donkeys , cattle and other animals from the farms in Floreana be transferred to other islands for the purpose of later colonization .
Non - native goats , pigs , dogs , rats , cats , mice , sheep , horses , donkeys , cows , poultry , ants , cockroaches , and some parasites inhabit the islands today .
Dogs and cats attack the tame birds and destroy the nests of birds , land tortoises , and marine turtles .
They sometimes kill small Galápagos tortoises and iguanas .
Pigs are even more harmful , covering larger areas and destroying the nests of tortoises , turtles and iguanas , as well as eating the animals ' native food .
Pigs also knock down vegetation in their search for roots and insects .
This problem abounds in Cerro Azul volcano and Isabela , and in Santiago , pigs may be the cause of the disappearance of the land iguanas that were so abundant when Darwin visited .
The black rat ( Rattus rattus ) attacks small Galápagos tortoises when they leave the nest , so in Pinzón they stopped the reproduction for a period of more than 50 years ; only adults were found on that island .
Also , where the black rat is found , the endemic rat has disappeared .
Cattle and donkeys eat all the available vegetation and compete with native species for the scarce water .
In 1959 , fishermen introduced one male and two female goats to Pinta island ; by 1973 , the National Park service estimated the population of goats to be over 30,000 individuals .
Goats were also introduced to Marchena in 1967 and to Rabida in 1971 .
A goat eradication program , however , cleared the goats from Pinta and Santiago and most of the goat population from Isabela .
In fact , by 2006 all feral pigs , donkeys and non - sterile goats had been eliminated from Santiago and Isabela , the largest islands with the worst problems due to non - native mammals .
Six species of small non - native vertebrates have established self - sufficient populations in Galápagos and may become invasive : Fowler 's snouted tree frog Scinax quinquefasciatus , common house gecko Hemidactylus frenatus , mourning gecko Lepidodactylus lugubris , dwarf gecko Gonatodes caudiscutatus , Peters ' leaf - toed gecko Phyllodactylus reissii , and smooth - billed ani Crotophaga ani .
Domestic fowl Gallus gallus holds feral populations , which may have self - sufficient populations , but evidence is unclear .
The fast - growing poultry industry on the inhabited islands has been cause for concern from local conservationists , who fear domestic birds could introduce disease into the endemic wild bird populations .
The Galápagos marine sanctuary is under threat from a host of illegal fishing activities , in addition to other problems of development .
The most pressing threat to the Marine Reserve comes from local , mainland and foreign fishing targeting marine life illegally within the Reserve , such as sharks ( hammerheads and other species ) for their fins , and the harvest of sea cucumbers out of season .
Development threatens both land and sea species .
The growth of both the tourism industry and local populations fuelled by high birth rates and illegal immigration threaten the wildlife of the Archipelago .
The grounding of the oil tanker Jessica in 2001 and the subsequent oil spill brought this threat to world attention .
In 2007 , UNESCO put the Galápagos Islands on their List of World Heritage in Danger because of threats posed by invasive species , unbridled tourism and overfishing .
On 29 July 2010 , the World Heritage Committee decided to remove the Galápagos Islands from the list because the Committee found significant progress had been made by Ecuador in addressing these problems .
On 28 January 2008 , Galápagos National Park official Victor Carrion announced 53 sea lions ( 13 pups , 25 youngsters , 9 males and 6 females ) were killed at the Galápagos Islands nature reserve on Pinta , with their heads caved in .
In 2001 , poachers killed 35 male sea lions .
The Galápagos Islands were short - listed as a candidate to be one of the New7Wonders of Nature by the New7Wonders of Nature Foundation .
As of February 2009 , the archipelago was ranked first in Group B , the category for islands .
The islands ' biodiversity is under threat from several sources .
The human population is growing at an unsustainable rate of 8 % per year ( 1995 ) .
Introduced species have caused damage , and in 1996 a US$ 5 million , five - year eradication plan commenced in an attempt to rid the islands of introduced species such as goats , rats , deer , and donkeys .
Except for the rats , the project was essentially completed in 2006 .
Rats have only been eliminated from the smaller Galápagos Islands of Rábida and Pinzón .
El Niño has adversely affected the marine ecosystem .
In January 2001 , an oil slick from a stranded tanker threatened the islands , but winds and shifting ocean currents helped disperse the oil before much damage was done .
The devastating El Nino of 1982 - 83 saw almost six times as much rain as normal in the Galapagos and created a wildlife catastrophe .
The 1997–98 El Niño adversely affected wildlife in the waters surrounding the islands , as the waters were warmer than normal .
Corals and barnacles suffered , hammerhead sharks were driven away , and most of the island 's seabirds failed to breed in 1997–98 .
The mortality rate of marine iguanas rose as the green algae they feed on was replaced by inedible red algae .
During the 1982–83 El Niño , 70 % of the marine iguanas starved to death because of this .
