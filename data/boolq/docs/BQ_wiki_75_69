SIG SAUER
P226
The SIG Sauer
P226 is a full - sized , service - type pistol made by SIG Sauer .
It is chambered for the 9×19 mm Parabellum , .40 S&W , .357 SIG , and .22 Long Rifle .
It is essentially the same basic design of the SIG Sauer P220 , but developed to use higher capacity , double stack magazines in place of the single stack magazines of the P220 .
The P226 itself has spawned further sub - variants ; the P228 and P229 are both compact versions of the double stack P226 design .
The SIG Sauer P226 and its variants are in service with numerous law enforcement and military organizations worldwide .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft ( SIG ) is a Swiss company , now known as Swiss Arms .
In 1975 , SIG entered into an agreement with German gun manufacturer J.P. Sauer & Sohn to develop and market a new handgun which became the P220 .
The P220 was the first SIG Sauer handgun sold in the US .
It was marketed initially by Browning as the Browning BDA .
The SIG Sauer P220 is a refinement of the Petter - Browning design used in the SIG P210 .
The locked breech design is very different and was pioneered by SIG Sauer .
See also The first SIG Sauer Handgun .
The P226 was designed for entry into the XM9 Service Pistol Trials ( see also Joint Service Small Arms Program ) that were held by the US Army in 1984 on behalf of the US armed forces to find a replacement for the M1911A1 and 24 other makes of handgun in US military service .
Only the Beretta 92SBF and the SIG
P226 satisfactorily completed the trials .
According to a GAO report , Beretta was awarded the M9 contract for the 92F due to a lower total package price .
The P226 cost less per pistol than the 92F , but SIG 's package price with magazines and spare parts was higher than Beretta 's .
The Navy SEALs , however , later chose to adopt the P226 as the P226 MK25 with special corrosion protection .
For the U.S. military XM9 trials , the P226 was imported by Saco Defense .
Interarms took over importing when the pistol was introduced for civilian sales .
SIG Sauer eventually founded SIGARMS ,
Inc. ( Now SIG Sauer ) in the United States to handle importation of their products .
In 2000 , SIG Holding AG sold J.P. Sauer & Sohn GmbH to two German businessmen .
The brand name SIG Sauer remained at J.P. Sauer & Sohn GmbH. DESIGN DETAILS Section::::Design details .
The P226 , like the other members of the SIG Classic family , operates by the locked breech short - recoil method pioneered by John Browning .
On firing , the slide and barrel are locked together for a few millimetres of rearward movement , after which the barrel is cammed down at the rear .
By this time the bullet has left the barrel and the pressure has dropped to safe levels , whereupon the slide completes the rearward stroke , ejecting the spent cartridge .
The recoil spring then propels the slide forward , stripping a round from the magazine and in the last few millimetres of forward movement the barrel is cammed upwards , locking the slide and barrel together again .
Instead of the locking lugs and recesses milled into the barrel and slide of other Browning - type firearms ( such as the Colt M1911A1 , Browning Hi - Power and CZ 75 ) , the P226 locks the barrel and slide together using an enlarged breech section of the barrel locking into the ejection port .
This modified system , which was devised by SIG based on Charles Petter 's Modèle 1935A pistol and their own SIG P210 , has no functional disadvantages compared to the original system , and has since been copied by numerous firearm manufacturers .
The slide of the pre-1996
P226 was a heavy gauge ,
mill finished sheet metal stamping with a welded on nose section incorporating an internal barrel bushing .
The breech block portion was a machined insert attached to the slide by means of brazing and a roll pin visible from either side .
Since 1996 , production has shifted to CNC machining and the slide is now milled from a single piece of stainless steel .
Therefore , the current standard P226 has a Nitron coated , stainless steel slide .
This resulted in a stronger slide , which was necessary to chamber the more powerful .40 S&W and .357 SIG cartridges .
The frame of most models is made from hard anodized aluminum alloy .
The standard SIG P226 incorporates a decocking lever on the left side of the frame above the magazine release button , which first appeared on the Sauer 38H prior to World War II , which allows the hammer to be dropped safely .
In chambering or firing a round , the actuation of the slide automatically cocks the hammer .
By using the decocking lever , the hammer can be de - cocked without actuating the firing pin block , making it impossible to accidentally fire the firearm by using the decocking lever .
Furthermore , using the decocking lever makes the firearm " drop safe " , which means the firing pin will be blocked from striking a loaded round unless the trigger is pulled .
Pulling the trigger and slowly lowering the hammer does not make the firearm " drop safe " , and can result in an accidental discharge if sufficient force is applied to the hammer .
Properly decocked , the pistol can be holstered safely and can be fired in double action mode by simply pulling the trigger .
With the exception of single action only models , the SIG P226 has no manual safety .
Double action trigger pressure is approximately .
Subsequent shots are fired in single action mode with a lighter trigger pressure of approximately .
As with other DA / SA pistols such as the HK USP and Beretta 92F , some training is required to minimize the difference in point of aim caused by the different trigger pressure between a first double action shot and subsequent single action shots .
The hammer may also be manually cocked at any time by the user to fire in single action mode .

VARIANTS
P226 RAIL Section::::Variants .
Section::::P226 Rail .
The P226 Rail ( or P226R ) is the same as a P226 , but it has a rail on the underside of the frame , just forward of the trigger guard .
The P226R 's rail has a more rounded contour than the military standard M1913 Picatinny rail and while most Picatinny - rail accessories will fit , not all will .
This has now become the standard
P226 .
P226 TACTICAL
Section::::P226 Tactical .
A
P226R with an extended barrel and external threads to accept a suppressor ( the standard P226 barrel length is 112 mm ( 4.4 in ) ) .
It was also equipped with SIGLITE Night Sights , 1 extended 20rd .
magazine and 2 standard 15rd .
magazines .
P226 TACTICAL OPERATIONS ( TACOPS )
Section::::P226 Tactical Operations ( TacOps ) .
Essentially a P226 Elite with extended Magwell grips and a Nitron coated stainless steel slide .
The Elite beavertail frame is used ( with standard accessory rail ) , and the slide features front cocking serrations .
Like the Elite , SRT is standard .
Magazine capacity is 20 rounds in 9 mm , and 15 rounds in .40S&W and .357 SIG .
The firearm comes with SigLite rear combat night sights and a TruGlo tritium fiber - optic front sight .
The firearm ships with 4 magazines .
An extended , threaded barrel is optional .
P226 NAVY Section::::P226 Navy .
U.S. Navy SEAL teams started using the SIG P226 in the 1980s , after German Kampfschwimmer tested them successfully .
The first Naval Special Warfare inspired P226 pistols to be offered to the public were the NSW Commemoratives , issued in early 2004 .
The SIG P226 - 9-NAVY is a version of the SIG P226 produced that features a stainless steel slide engraved with an anchor to designate them as Naval Special Warfare pistols .
SIGARMS raised $ 100,000 for the Special Operations Warrior Foundation through the sale of these NSW serialized pistols .
The pistol with the serial number NSW0001 was sold during a live auction on the US - wide syndicated Laura Ingraham radio show for an additional $ 25,000 .
Later produced commercial versions added a universal rail for accessory attachments while retaining the anchor of previous models , but do not have the SIGLITE Night Sights .
P226 MK25
Section::::P226 MK25 .
Released in 2011 , the MK25 has been advertised by SIG as being identical to firearm carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs .
Features that help identify it amongst other P226 variants include the silver anchor and UID identification label on the left side of the pistol , as well as a mil - spec picatinny rail .
Although cosmetically similar to the Navy model , the MK25 features an anti - corrosion coating applied to all external and internal surfaces , as well as SIGLITE Night Sights .
P226 BLACKWATER
Section::::P226 Blackwater .
Introduced in 2007 , the SIG P226 Blackwater was designed in cooperation with the Blackwater Training Center .
It featured SIGLITE front and rear night sights , the Blackwater USA logo on the slide and wood grips , an integral Picatinny rail , black anodized frame , and Nitron - coated stainless steel slide .
It was available only in 9×19 mm Parabellum , with a double - action / single - action ( DA / SA ) trigger .
The gun was sold with five 15-round 9 mm magazines .
The P226 Blackwater was discontinued in 2009 with the release of the P226 Blackwater Tactical - a nearly identical pistol also with 20-round 9 mm magazines .
The Blackwater Tactical has since been discontinued , having been replaced by the Tactical Operations .
It is essentially the same firearm , but lacks Blackwater markings .
P226 SCT
Section::::P226 SCT .
The P226 SCT ( Super Capacity Tactical ) is an all black , Nitron finished
P226 featuring front cocking serrations , accessory rail , a SIGLITE rear night sight , a TRUGLO Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and comes with four newly designed 20-round magazines for the 9 mm version or four 15-round magazines for the .40 S&W version .
P226 EQUINOX Section::::P226 Equinox .
The P226 Equinox comes chambered in .40 S&W and features a two - tone accented design .
The design is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide and nickel accents of the gun 's controls .
The P226 Equinox comes with a TRUGLO Tritium Fiber Optic front sight , rear SIGLITE night sights , SIG accessory rail , and gray laminated wood grips .
P226 ST Section::::P226 ST .
The SIG Sauer P226 ST was a limited production all - stainless version of the SIG P226 pistol .
It is heavier than a standard P226 because the frame was made of stainless steel instead of aluminum .
Weight with the magazine was a hefty vs of the standard aluminum - framed version .
The added weight of an all - stainless frame is claimed to provide greater recoil reduction and a quicker return to target between shots making it a common choice among Practical Shooting competitors .
The P226 Stainless had a blued barrel and featured an M1913 Picatinny rail .
These frames were made in Germany .
Prototypes were tested in 2004 and it went into production in very limited numbers .
The P226 ST is no longer manufactured .
P226 S SPORT STOCK Section::::P226 S Sport Stock .
The P226 Sport Stock was produced in Germany in 2002 and 2004 in limited numbers , all stainless construction with a strengthened frame dust cover , 4.4 inch stainless bull barrel , extended controls , and comes originally with Hogues grips and LPA target sights , these are often referred as the SIG Mastershop predecessors to the X - family .
P226R HSP Section::::P226R HSP .
On sale in September 2005 , SIG Sauer Homeland Security Pistols ( HSP ) are the same models SIG builds for the United States Department of Homeland Security .
This is a limited production run of 1,000 P226R HSP pistols available engraved with the American flag and Homeland Security X of 1000 .
Additionally , each pistol comes in .40 S&W caliber and is engraved with serial number barcoding just like those which were shipped to DHS .

Their frames are " Flat Dark Earth " in compliance with the Combat Pistol program .
The Combat model comes with night sights , a Nitron - finished slide and barrel , fore slide serrations , desert tan polymer grips and a military standard M1913 Picatinny rail as well as phosphate coated internals .
The TB model features an extra on the barrel , and external threads to accept a suppressor .
P226 E2 Section::::P226 E2 .
Introduced at the 2010 SHOT Show , the P226 E2 at the time was a significant update to the P226 line . '
E2 ' ( pronounced ' E - squared ' ) , or otherwise known as " Enhanced Ergonomics " , is SIG Sauer 's attempt to make the large frame gun more ergonomic for persons with small and medium - sized hands .
A reduced grip size and reduced reach trigger bring the trigger face back more than , thus potentially allowing better trigger manipulation and control for a greater number of shooters .
Other standard features include the Short Reset Trigger , aggressive grip finish texture , and a new wrap - around , one - piece grip panel configuration .
The gun was discontinued from the P226 model lineup at the end of 2010 but the E2-style grip system has been adopted on and carried over to other P226 variants .
P226 / P229 CLASSIC 22 Section::::P226 / P229 Classic 22 .
This .22LR model 's primary purpose is as practice or range pistols .
The Classic 22 has an aluminum slide with a nitron finish ( instead of the centerfire stainless steel slide ) and a barrel chambered in .22LR .
The Classic 22 slide assembly is complete with a lighter recoil spring and plastic guide rod .
It also incorporates the same frame and operation as center fire
P226 models .
The Classic 22 model is available as a stand - alone firearm or as a conversion kit to an existing center fire
P226 or P229 .
Likewise , conversion kits ( the SIG Sauer X - Change Kits ) exist to convert a .22LR into 9 mm , .40 S&W or .357 SIG .
The conversion can be accomplished by field stripping the firearm and replacing the slide assembly and magazine - a process that can be accomplished in seconds .
The Classic 22 use a 10-round polymer magazine in lieu of the steel magazines used by the centre fire models and conversion kits .
The P226 Classic 22 should not be confused with the SIG Sauer Mosquito .22LR pistol .
The Classic 22 is a full - sized P226 while the Mosquito is modelled on the P226 but is 90 % of the size .
Also the Classic 22 is manufactured by SIG Sauer while the Mosquito is made under licence by German Sport Guns GmbH.
P226 LDC Section::::P226 LDC .
In 2014 SIG Sauer sports division in Germany introduced the P226 LDC Version .
This version is made for shooting sports and features a longer dust cover and 1913 rail .
It also features the E2 grip and the SRT Short reset trigger system , HiViz front sight , adjustable rear sight and skeletonized hammer .
The magazine takes 17 rounds .
P226 LEGION Section::::P226 Legion .
In 2015 , SIG Sauer announced the Legion Series of firearms , including the P226 Legion ( available in 9 mm , .357 SIG , and .40 S&W ) and P226 SAO Legion ( available in 9 mm ) .
The P226 Legion included a number of modifications from the original West German P226 , including upgraded sights , reduced decocker and slide release , grey PVD coating , custom grips , reduced beavertail , solid steel guide rod , and custom trigger .
P228 ( M11 )
Section::::P228 ( M11 ) .
A compact version of the P226 , the P228 , is in use with various law enforcement agencies and also with the US military , where it is designated as the M11 .
The P228 has a shorter slide and barrel than the P226 .
Unlike the P226 , the P228 is available only in 9×19 mm Parabellum with a 13-round magazine , but can also use P226 15- or 20-round magazines .
Aftermarket magazines extend the capacity of the P228 to 15 rounds .
From a distance , the P228 can be differentiated from the P226 by comparing the trigger guards ( the P228 's is curved , while the P226 's is slightly hooked ) and the barrel and slide lengths ( the P228 's barrel , thus having a corresponding shorter slide ) .
Also in a side - by - side comparison the P228 would appear slightly shorter ( shorter ) than the P226 .
The larger capacity
P226 magazine can also be employed in the P228 although it extends from the base of the grip .
Civilian sales of the P228 were discontinued with the introduction of 9 mm chambering in the P229 but were recently reintroduced in limited quantities to civilians with an accessory rail and hooked trigger guard , designated the P228R.
The P229 is nearly identical to the P228 , however its slide is made from milled stainless steel ( versus the P228 's folded carbon steel slide ) and is available in 9 mm , .40 S&W , and .357 SIG .
In the summer of 2012 , SIG Sauer announced they were releasing the M11A1 , which is essentially the milled - slide P229 chambered in 9 mm with P228-labeled grips , a short reset trigger , SIGLITE tritium night sights , Mec - Gar 15-round magazines , and a military style smart tag and serial number .
Later in 2012 , Air Force M11b versions of the P228 were released for civilian sale .
The M11 is to be replaced in the Army and Air Force through the Modular Handgun System program .
On January 19 , 2017 , it was announced that the SIG Sauer P320 Compact ( M18 ) had been selected to replace the M11 as the U.S 's service pistol .
One factor in winning the Modular Handgun System competition was the ability to employ 9 mm Parabellum , .357 Sig or .40 S&W cartridges within the same basic frame .
P229 Section::::P229 .
The P229 is a compact firearm often used for duty or concealed carry purposes .
The standard version features a DA / SA trigger .
The pistol has also been made available in a DAK ( Double Action Kellermann ) model , which is a DAO system with two trigger reset points , and a lighter , smoother pull than that of traditional DAO handguns .
Most of the above - mentioned factory variants of the P226 are also available for the P229 , including the Equinox option , Elite lineup , as well as a SAS GEN 2 model .
The P229 differs from its cousin the P226 in several respects , and was originally introduced to supplement and then replace the P228 by adding the .357 SIG and .40 S&W as available chamberings .
The P229 was the first production handgun introduced that could chamber the .357 SIG round .
The P226 and P228 were originally manufactured using a stamped - steel slide on an aluminum alloy frame .
The P229 consists of a CNC - milled stainless steel slide , typically colored black with a Nitron finish .
The P229 's milled steel slide was introduced to handle the higher slide velocities created by the .357 SIG and .40 S&W loads , which the stamped slide of the P228 could not handle without the use of a much stiffer recoil spring .
This would have made manual slide - retraction much more difficult and the use of a milled stainless slide ( coupled with the new milling and stainless production capabilities found in the U.S. factory ) with a standard weight recoil spring made more sense .
A standard weight recoil spring for the P229 is .
A spring weight of or higher would have been required if a stamped slide was used for the .40 S&W or .357 SIG chamberings .
The SAAMI maximum chamber pressures of 9 mm , 9 mm + P , .40 S&W , and .357 SIG are as follows : ; ; ; and .
The slide on the P226 was redesigned in a similar fashion , and civilian sales of the P228 were discontinued in early 2005 due to declining sales and the advent of the P229 in 9 mm .
The P226 and P229 are both available with optional accessory rails and optional forged stainless steel frames .
The P229 can be chambered in .22 LR , 9 mm , .40 S&W or .357 SIG .
Changing between .40 S&W and .357 SIG is as simple as switching out the barrel ; both calibers use the same magazine .
Conversion barrels also allow a P229 or P226 to change between a .40 S&W/.357 SIG to a 9 mm caliber .
The 9 mm model ( both railed and non - railed ) can be converted to .22 LR , but in the past its receivers were not designed to provide the space needed for handling the larger rounds of .357 SIG and .40 S&W.
As SIG Sauer has slowly begun adopting the E2-style grip system across the P229 model range in 2011—a move similar to what is also happening to the larger P226—they have also begun using the .357 SIG/.40 S&W spec frame dimensions for their factory 9 mm P229s , presumably to streamline the number of variations in parts needed to be kept in inventory .
Although the manufacturer has announced that older - configuration magazines will continue to operate in the new receiver configuration , SIG Sauer has nonetheless revised new P229 9 mm factory magazines to a design that is specific to the resized magazine well of the newly reconfigured receiver / frame .
As a consequence , the newer magazines are not back - compatible , due to their larger width .
DAK VERSION Section::::DAK Version .
SIG released an altered version of the double - action only ( DAO ) pistols called the DAK ( for Double Action Kellermann , after the designer of the trigger system , Harald Kellermann of Eckernförde , Germany ) .
The DAK capability is available in 220 , 226 , 229 and 239 models .
When firing the pistol the first trigger pull is ( compared to for the standard DAO ) .
After the pistol fires and the trigger is released forward , the trigger has an intermediate reset point that is approximately halfway to the rest position .
The trigger pull from this intermediate reset point is .
If the trigger is released all the way forward , this will engage the primary trigger reset and have a trigger pull of .
To engage the intermediate reset , the trigger must be held to the rear while the slide is cycled , either manually or by the recoil of a round being fired .
The pistol can be cocked by pulling the trigger just past the trigger reset , then stopping , then releasing .
The United States Coast Guard began switching over to the SIG P229R - DAK in .40 S&W in 2004 , beginning with the first shipment of 14,000 handguns from the production facility .
According to producer site more than 3 million rounds were fired during U.S. Government testing .
The " R " denotes the accessory rail ahead of the trigger guard .
P224 Section::::P224 .
The P224 is a subcompact variant of the compact P229 .
When the new design was announced in January 2012 , the line was chambered only in .357 SIG and .40 S&W , and came only with a DAK ( Double Action Kellermann ) trigger .
SIG announced that they would expand the line to include a DA / SA ( Double Action / Single Action ) trigger , a SRT DA / SA ( Short Reset Double / Single Action ) and would add a 9 mm version in the future .
As of 2013 , the P224 was available in the original two calibers and the DAK trigger with four factory variants ; SIG Anti - Snag ( SAS ) , Nickel , Extreme and Equinox .
The P224 was discontinued a few years after it was introduced , and replaced with the P229C. The P229C also accepts newer P229 magazines , which have a higher capacity .
The P224 is long , compared to for the P229 .
It is also about shorter at and thinner at than the P229 .
It weighs less than the alloy frame P229 and less than the stainless steel frame p229 .
The standard P224 magazine capacity is 10 rounds .357 SIG/.40 S&W and 12 rounds in 9 mm .
