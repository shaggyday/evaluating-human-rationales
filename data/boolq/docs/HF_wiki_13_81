7.62×51MM NATO
The 7.62×51 mm NATO ( official NATO nomenclature 7.62 NATO ) is a rimless bottlenecked rifle cartridge developed in the 1950s as a standard for small arms among NATO countries .
It should not be confused with the similarly named Russian 7.62×54mmR cartridge , a slightly longer rimmed cartridge .
It was introduced in U.S. service in the M14 rifle and M60 machine gun in the late 1950s .
The M14 was superseded in U.S. service as the infantry adopted the 5.56×45 mm NATO M16 .
However , the M14 and many other firearms that use the 7.62×51 round remain in service , especially in the case of various sniper rifles , medium machine guns such as the M240 , and various rifles in use by special operations forces .
The cartridge is used both by infantry and on mounted and crew - served weapons mounted to vehicles , aircraft and ships .
Although not identical , the 7.62×51 mm NATO and the commercial
.308
Winchester cartridges are similar enough that they can be loaded into rifles chambered for the other round , but the Winchester .308 cartridges are typically loaded to higher pressures than 7.62×51 mm NATO cartridges .
Even though the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers ' Institute ( SAAMI ) does not consider it unsafe to fire the commercial round in weapons chambered for the NATO round , there is significant discussion about compatible chamber and muzzle pressures between the two cartridges based on powder loads and wall thicknesses on the military vs. commercial rounds .
While the debate goes both ways , the ATF recommends checking the stamping on the barrel ; if unsure , one can consult the maker of the firearm .
OVERVIEW
Section::::Overview .
The 7.62×51 mm NATO cartridge approaches the ballistic performance of the original U.S. military .30 - 06 Springfield M1906 service cartridge .
Modern propellants allowed for similar performance from a smaller case with less case capacity , a case that requires less brass and yields a shorter cartridge .
This shorter cartridge allows a slight reduction in the size and weight of firearms that chamber it , and better cycling in automatic and semi - automatic rifles .
The .30 - 06 Springfield M1906 round weighed , and the 7.62×51 mm NATO M80 round weighs .
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Development .
Work that would eventually develop the 7.62×51 mm NATO started just after World War
I when the large , powerful .30 - 06 cartridge proved difficult to adapt to semi - automatic rifles .
A less powerful cartridge would allow a lighter firing mechanism .
At the time the most promising design was the .276 Pedersen .
When it was eventually demonstrated that the .30 - 06 was suitable for semi - automatic rifles , the .276 was dropped .
Thus when war appeared to be looming again , only a couple of decades later , the .30 - 06 was the only round available , and the M1 Garand provided U.S. troops with greater firepower than their bolt action - armed opponents .
The Garand performed so well that the U.S. saw little need to replace it during World War II , and the .30 - 06 served well beyond the Korean War and into the mid-1950s .
The .30 - 06 was officially replaced by the 7.62 NATO M14 in 1957 .
During the 1940s and early 1950s , several experiments were carried out to improve the Garand .
One of the most common complaints was the limited - capacity 8-round en - bloc clip , and many experimental designs modified the weapon with a detachable box magazine .
Springfield Armory 's T20 rifle was a fully automatic version .
Though not adopted , experience with a fully automatic Garand laid the groundwork for its replacement .
The test program continued for several years , including both the original .30 - 06 round and a modified .300 Savage ( then known as the T65 ) .
In the end , the T65 cartridge demonstrated power roughly equal to the original .30 - 06 , firing a bullet at but was approximately shorter .
The eventual result of this competition was the T44.280 British ( 7 mm ) cartridge with an eye towards controllable fully automatic fire .
The U.S. held to its desire not to reduce the effectiveness of individual aimed shots .
The American philosophy was to use automatic fire for emergencies only and continue to use semi - automatic fire the majority of the time .
After considerable debate , the Canadian Army announced they would be happy to use the .280
but only if the U.S. did as well .
It was clear the U.S. was not going to use the .280 .
The British did start introducing the .280 along with the bull - pup Rifle No . 9 , but the process was stopped in the interests of harmonization across NATO .
The T65E5 [ 7.62×51 mm ] was chosen as the NATO standard cartridge in 1954 .
Winchester Ammunition ( a division of the Olin Corporation ) saw the market for a civilian model of the T65 cartridge and released it commercially in 1952 as the .308 Winchester , two years prior to adoption of the cartridge by NATO .
The dimensions of .308 Winchester are almost the same as 7.62 mm NATO .
The chamber of the former has a marginally shorter headspace and thinner case walls than the latter due to changed specifications between 1952 and 1954 .
This allows 7.62 mm NATO ammunition to feed reliably in rifles chambered for .308 Winchester rifles but can cause .308 Winchester ammunition cases to rupture when fired in rifles chambered for 7.62 mm NATO .
The T44 was adopted as the M14 in 1957 .
Around the same time Britain and Canada adopted the Belgian FN FAL ( L1A1 SLR British ) as the L1 followed by West German army as the G1 .
The Germans soon transitioned to a modified version of the Spanish CETME rifle by Heckler & Koch that was adopted as the G3 .
With all three of these firearms , it was clear that the 7.62 mm NATO could not be fired controllably in fully automatic because of recoil .
Both the M14 and FAL were later modified to limit fully automatic selection through semi - automatic versions or selector locks .
Efforts were also made to improve control with bipods or heavier barrels .
While this was going on , the U.S. Project SALVO concluded that a burst of four rounds into a circle would cause twice the number of casualties as a fully automatic burst by one of these rifles , regardless of the size of the round .
They suggested using a much smaller .22 caliber cartridge with two bullets per cartridge ( a duplex load ) , while other researchers investigated the promising flechette rounds that were lighter but offered better penetration than even the .30 - 06 .
When the M14 arrived in Vietnam , it was found to have a few disadvantages .
The rifle 's overall length was not well suited for jungle warfare .
Also , the weight of 7.62×51 mm cartridges limited the total amount of ammunition that could be carried in comparison with the 7.62×39 mm cartridge of the Type 56 and AK-47 rifles , with which the Vietcong and North Vietnamese Army soldiers were equipped .
In addition , the originally issued wooden - stocked versions of the M14 were susceptible to warping from moisture in tropical environments , producing " wandering zeroes " and other accuracy problems , which caused the adoption of fiberglass stocks .
Fighting between the big - round and small - round groups reached a peak in the early 1960s , when test after test showed the .223 Remington cartridge fired from the AR-15 allowed an 8-soldier unit to outgun an 11-soldier unit armed with M14s at ranges closer than 300 meters .
U.S. troops were able to carry more than twice as much 5.56×45 mm ammunition as 7.62×51 mm for the same weight , which allowed them an advantage against a typical N.V.A.Mk 14 Enhanced Battle Rifle and M25 Sniper Rifle were utilized in the United States military as designated marksman and sniper rifles .
Shorter , easier - to - handle 7.62 mm rifles like the Heckler & Koch G3 stayed in service due to their accuracy , range , cartridge effectiveness and reliability .
Specialized loadings were created for 7.62×51 mm NATO - chambered sniper rifles .
They used heavier and more streamlined bullets that had a higher ballistic coefficient than standard ball rounds , meaning they shed velocity at longer ranges more gradually .
Loss of velocity is important for accurate long - range shots because dropping from supersonic to transonic speeds disturbs the flight of the bullet and adversely affects accuracy .
The standard M80 ball round weighs 147 gr and has a muzzle velocity faster than the M118LR 175 gr sniping round .
However , the M80 drops to subsonic velocity around , while the initially slower M118LR is supersonic out to due to its low - drag bullet .
The 7.62×51 mm NATO round nevertheless met the designer 's demands for fully automatic reliability with a full - power round .
It remained the main machine gun round for almost all NATO forces well into the 1990s , even being used in adapted versions of older .30 - 06 machine guns such as the Browning M1919A4 from the WWII era .
The .303 British Bren gun was also subject to conversion to fire the 7.62×51 mm NATO round .
the converted weapon being reclassified as the L4 Light machine gun .
These have been replaced to a considerable extent in the light machine gun role by 5.56×45 mm NATO weapons , such as the widespread use of the M249 SAW , but the 7.62 round is still the standard chambering for most general - purpose machine guns such as the M60E4 , the M240 and the German HK21 and MG3 , and flexible mountings such as helicopters , jeeps , and tanks .
It is also commonly found in coaxial mount applications such as found in parallel with the main gun on tanks .
The U.S. Army has developed an improved version of the M80 ball 7.62 mm round , called the M80A1 .
The M80A1 incorporates changes found in the M855A1 5.56 mm round .
Like the M855A1 , the M80A1 is expected to have better hard - target penetration , more consistent performance against soft targets , and significantly increased distances of these effects over the M80 .
The bullet is redesigned with a copper jacket and exposed hardened steel penetrator , eliminating of lead with production of each M80A1 projectile .
The M80A1 began fielding in September 2014 .
The U.S. Special Operations Command plans to begin fielding of the 6.5 Creedmoor cartridge in early 2019 to replace the 7.62 NATO round in semi - automatic sniper rifles .
Tests determined that compared to the 7.62 NATO , the 6.5 Creedmoor doubles hit probability at 1,000 meters , increases effective range by nearly half , reduces wind drift by a third and has less recoil .
The same rifles can use the new cartridge , as their similar dimensions allow the same magazines to be used and the weapon only requires a barrel change .

It was standardized as M118 match in mid-1965 .
It used the same bullet as the .30 - 06 Springfield M72 Match Ball round , match - grade brass cartridges , and used fitted No . 43 primers .
Production ceased at Frankford in 1965 but continued at Lake City until the early 1980s .
Lake City used dedicated equipment to produce the ammo up until the mid-1970s and during that time the quality of the ammunition was quite good .
When they ceased using dedicated machinery the quality of the ammo had a very noticeable decline .

Tailed ( FMJBT ) bullet and staked No . 34 or No . 36 primers .
During this period in the early to late 1980s the performance of the round declined .
Powder , primer , and brass were the same as standard ball rounds ; bullets and powder charges varied in weight due to worn machinery and poor quality control .
Since it could n't be called " Match " due to its erratic trajectory , it was renamed " Special Ball " .
Snipers used to test shoot batches of ammo , find a batch that shot well ( or at least consistently ) , then zeroed their weapon to that batch and tried to procure as much of that ammo as possible .
