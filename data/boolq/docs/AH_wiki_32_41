UNIVERSAL PRODUCT CODE
The Universal Product Code ( UPC ) is a barcode symbology that is widely used in the United States , Canada , United Kingdom , Australia , New Zealand , in Europe and other countries for tracking trade items in stores .
UPC ( technically refers to UPC - A ) consists of 12 numeric digits that are uniquely assigned to each trade item .
Along with the related EAN barcode , the UPC is the barcode mainly used for scanning of trade items at the point of sale , per GS1 specifications .
UPC data structures are a component of GTINs and follow the global GS1 specification , which is based on international standards .
But some retailers ( clothing , furniture ) do not use the GS1 system ( rather other barcode symbologies or article number systems ) .
On the other hand , some retailers use the EAN / UPC barcode symbology , but without using a GTIN ( for products sold in their own stores only ) .
HISTORY Section::::History .
Wallace Flint proposed an automated checkout system in 1932 using punched cards .
Bernard Silver and Norman Joseph Woodland , a graduate student from Drexel Institute of Technology ( now Drexel University ) , developed a bull's - eye style code and applied for the patent in 1949 .
In the 1960s , railroads experimented with a multicolor barcode for tracking rail cars , but they eventually abandoned it .
A group of grocery industry trade associations formed the Uniform Grocery Product Code Council which , with consultants Larry Russell and Tom Wilson of McKinsey & Company , defined the numerical format of the Uniform Product Code .
Technology firms including Charegon , IBM , Litton - Zellweger , Pitney Bowes - Alpex , Plessey - Anker , RCA , Scanner Inc. , Singer , and Dymo Industries / Data General proposed alternative symbol representations to the council .
In the end the Symbol Selection Committee chose to slightly modify , changing the font in the human readable area , the IBM proposal designed by George J. Laurer .
The first UPC marked item ever scanned at a retail checkout was at the Marsh supermarket in Troy , Ohio at 8:01 a.m. on June 26 , 1974 , and was a 10-pack ( 50 sticks ) of Wrigley 's Juicy Fruit chewing gum .
The shopper was Clyde Dawson and cashier Sharon Buchanan made the first UPC scan .
The NCR cash register rang up 67 cents .
The entire shopping cart also had barcoded items in it , but the gum was the first one picked up .
This item went on display at the Smithsonian Institution 's National Museum of American History in Washington ,
D.C. IBM PROPOSAL Section::::IBM proposal .
Around late 1969 , IBM at Research Triangle Park ( RTP ) in North Carolina assigned George Laurer to determine how to make a supermarket scanner and label .
In late 1970 , Heard Baumeister provided equations to calculate characters per inch achievable by two IBM bar codes , Delta A and Delta B.
In February , 1971 , Baumeister joined Laurer .
In mid 1971 , William " Bill " Crouse invented a new bar code called Delta C.
It achieved four times the characters per inch as Delta B. Delta B compared bar widths to space width to code bits .
This was extremely sensitive to ink spread where too much ink or pressure would cause both edges of a bar to spread outward and too little to cause them to shrink .
To make it worse as bars spread spaces shrink and vice versa .
Delta C achieved its higher performance by only using leading to leading or trailing to trailing edges which was unaffected by uniform ink spread .
The code provided best performance when it had a defined character set with a fixed reference distance that spanned most or preferably all the character .
In August , 1971 , Crouse joined the scanner effort .
After several months they had made no progress .
They were aware of the RCA bull 's eye label that could be scanned with a simple straight line laser scanner , but a readable label was far too large .
Although Litton Industries proposed a bull 's eye symbol cut in half to reduce the area , it was still too large and presented the same ink smear printing problems as the RCA symbol .
The redundancy and checking ability were removed completely .
They were also aware of the many proposals from around the world , none of which were feasible .
In the spring of 1972 , Baumeister announced a breakthrough .
He proposed a label with bars that were slightly longer than the distance across all bars that needed to be read in a single pass .
This label could be scanned with a simple " X " scanner only slightly more complex than the straight line laser scanner .
The next day Baumeister suggested if the label were split into two halves the bar lengths could be cut nearly in half .
These two proposals reduced the area from the bull 's eye by one third
and then one sixth .
The image to the right shows the label proposed by Baumeister .
He did not specify any specific bar code as that was well understood .
Except for the bar coding and ten digits the UPC label today is his proposal .
Shortly after that Baumeister transferred to another area of RTP .
Laurer proceeded to define the details of the label and write a proposal .
N.J. Woodland was assigned as planner for the project and aided Laurer with writing his proposal .
Laurer 's first attempt with a bar code used Delta B.
The resulting label size was about six inches by three inches which was too large .
Crouse suggested that Laurer use his Delta C bar code and provided a copy of his patent that had a sample alphanumeric character set and rules to generate other size alphabets .
This reduced the label size to about 1.5 " x 0.9 " .
Later Laurer asked Crouse for assistance in how the scanner could detect a label .
Together they defined guard bars and a definition of how to detect the label .
The guard bars also provided identification for half label discrimination and training bars for the scanner threshold circuits .
Laurer had a complete label definition and proceeded to write his proposal .
Previously Crouse had an idea for a simple wand worn like a ring and bracelet .
He decided to develop that wand to provide a demonstration of the label .
On December 1 , 1972 , IBM presented Laurer 's proposal to the Super Market Committee in Rochester , Minnesota , the location where IBM would develop the scanner .
During the presentation , Crouse gave a lab demonstration where he read UPC - like labels with his ring wand .
In addition to reading regular labels , he read the large two - page centerfold label in the proposal booklet .
He then turned to a page showing a photo of labeled items sitting on a table .
The labels were small and flawed due to the resolution of the printed photo but the wand read many of them .
This demonstration showed the robustness of the pure Delta C code .
The proposal was accepted .
One month later , January 1 , 1973 Crouse transferred back to IBM 's Advanced Technology group , and Laurer remained with the full responsibility for the label .
Dymo Industries , makers of handheld printing devices insisted that the code be character independent , so that handheld printing devices could produce the bar code in store if the items were not bar - coded by the manufacturers .
Dymo 's proposal was accepted by IBM and incorporated in IBM 's latest proposal .
It was decided that the two halves of the label should have a different set of numeric characters .
The character set Laurer derived from the Delta C patent used seven printable increments or units where two bars and two spaces would be printed .
This yielded twenty combinations of characters , but there were two pairs that when read by Delta C rules yielded the same code for the pair .
Since eighteen characters were not enough Laurer tried adding one unit to the character set .
This yielded twenty - six Delta C characters which could provide the two sets of decimal characters but it also added fourteen percent to the width of the label and thereby the height .
This would be a thirty percent increase in area or a label of 1.7"x1.03 " .
Laurer felt this was not acceptable .
He returned to the original character set with twenty characters but four of those were two pairs with the same Delta C reading .
He decided to use them all .
To distinguish between the pairs he would measure one bar width in each of the pairs to distinguish them from each other .
For each pair those bars would be one or two units wide .
Laurer did n't apply Baumeister 's equations to this set .
He felt just one bar width measurement would not be too serious .
As it turned out it would have required over fifty percent increase in width and height for an area increase of more than double .
Laurer later admitted these four characters in each set were responsible for most of the scanner read errors .
David Savir , a mathematician , was given the task of proving the symbol could be printed and would meet the reliability requirements , and was most likely unaware of Baumeister 's equations .
He and Laurer added two more digits to the ten for error correction and detection .
Then they decided to add odd / even parity to the number of units filled with bars in each side .
Odd / even parity is a technique used to detect any odd number of bit errors in a bit stream .
They decided to use odd on one half and even on the other .
This would provide additional indication of which half ticket was being read .
This meant that every bar width had to be read accurately to provide a good reading .
It also meant every space would also be known .
Requiring every bit width to be read precisely basically nullified the Delta C advantage except for the Delta C reference measurement .
Only the strange character set and the size of the label remains as a shadow of the Delta C code .
The size was still that calculated for pure Delta C.
If the label size had been properly recalculated , taking into account the required bar width measurements the label would have been far too large to be acceptable .
Mechanical engineering and electronic circuit design commonly require worst case designs using known tolerances .
Many engineers working with bar codes had little experience with such things and used somewhat intuitive methods .
This was the cause of the poor performance of the Delta B code and quite likely the failure of RCA 's bull 's eye scanner .
The following table shows the workable labels , available in the early 1970s , with their sizes . !

COMPOSITION Section::::Composition .
Each UPC - A barcode consists of a scannable strip of black bars and white spaces above a sequence of 12 numerical digits .
No letters , characters or other content of any kind may appear on a UPC - A barcode .
There is a one - to - one correspondence between 12-digit number and strip of black bars and white spaces , i.e. there is only one way to represent each 12-digit number visually and there is only one way to represent each strip of black bars and white spaces numerically .
The scannable area of every UPC - A barcode follows the pattern SLLLLLLMRRRRRRE , where S ( start ) , M ( middle ) , and E ( end ) guard patterns are represented the same way on every UPC - A barcode and the L ( left ) and
R ( right ) sections collectively represent the 12 numerical digits that make each UPC - A unique .
The first digit L indicates a particular number system to be used by the following digits .
The last digit R is an error detecting check digit FORMATTING Section::::Formatting .
UPC - A barcodes can be printed at various densities to accommodate a variety of printing and scanning processes .
The significant dimensional parameter is called x - dimension ( width of single module element ) .
The width of each bar ( space ) is determined by multiplying the x - dimension and the module width ( 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 units ) of each bar ( space ) .
Since the guard patterns each include two bars , and each of the 12 digits of the UPC - A barcode consists of two bars and two spaces , all UPC - A barcodes consist of exactly ( 3 × 2 ) + ( 12 × 2 ) = 30 bars ,
of which 6 represent guard patterns and 24 represent numerical digits .
The x - dimension for the UPC - A at the nominal size is 0.33 mm ( 0.013 " ) .
Nominal symbol height for UPC - A is 25.9 mm ( 1.02 " ) .
The bars forming the S ( start ) , M ( middle ) , and E ( end ) guard patterns , are extended downwards by 5 times x - dimension , with a resulting nominal symbol height of 27.55 mm ( 1.08 " ) .
This also applies to the bars of the first and last numerical digit of UPC - A barcode .
UPC - A can be reduced or magnified anywhere from 80 % to 200 % .
A quiet zone , with a width of at least 9 times the x - dimension , must be present on each side of the scannable area of the UPC - A barcode .
For a GTIN-12 number encoded in a UPC - A barcode , the first and last digits are always placed outside the symbol in order to indicate the quiet zones that are necessary for barcode scanners to work properly .
ENCODING
Section::::Encoding .
The UPC - A barcode is visually represented by strips of bars and spaces that encode the UPC - A 12-digit number .
Each digit is represented by a unique pattern of 2 bars and 2 spaces .
The bars and spaces are variable width , i.e. 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 modules wide .
The total width for a digit is always 7 modules ; consequently , UPC - A 12-digit number requires a total of 7×12 = 84 modules .
A complete UPC - A is 95 modules wide : 84 modules for the digits ( L and R sections ) combined with 11 modules for the S ( start ) , M ( middle ) , and E ( end ) guard patterns .
The S ( start ) and E ( end ) guard patterns are 3 modules wide and use the pattern bar - space - bar , where each bar and space is one module wide .
The M ( middle ) guard pattern is 5 modules wide and uses the pattern space - bar - space - bar - space , where each bar and space is also one module wide .
In addition , a UPC - A symbol requires a quiet zone ( extra space of 9 modules wide ) before the S ( start ) and after the E ( end ) guard patterns .

The UPC - A 's left - hand side digits ( the digits to the left of the M ( middle ) guard pattern ) have odd parity , which means the total width of the black bars is an odd number of modules .
On the contrary , the right - hand side digits have even parity .
Consequently , a UPC scanner can determine whether it is scanning a symbol from left - to - right or from right - to - left
( the symbol is upside - down ) .
After seeing a S ( start ) or E ( end ) guard pattern ( they are the same , bar - space - bar , whichever direction they are read ) , the scanner will first see odd parity digits , if scanning left - to - right , or even parity digits , if scanning right - to - left .
With the parity / direction information , an upside - down symbol will not confuse the scanner .
When confronted with an upside - down symbol , the scanner may simply ignore it ( many scanners alternate left - to - right and right - to - left scans , so they will read the symbol on a subsequent pass ) or recognize the digits and put them in the right order .
There is another property in the digit encoding .
The right - hand side digits are the optical inverse of the left - hand side digits , i.e. black bars are turned into white spaces and vice versa .
For example , the left - hand side " 4 " is space×1
- bar×1 - space×3 - bar×2 , meanwhile the right - hand side " 4 " is bar×1 - space×1
- bar×3 - space×2 . NUMBERING Section::::Numbering .
The number of UPC - A and UPC - E barcodes are limited by the standards used to create them .
UPC - A : ( 10 possible values per left digit ^ 6 left digits ) × ( 10 possible values per right digit
^
5 right digits )
= 100,000,000,000 .
UPC - E : ( 10 possible values per digit ^ 6 digits ) × ( 2 possible parity patterns per UPC - E number ) = 2,000,000 .
NUMBER SYSTEM DIGIT
Section::::Number system digit .
Below is description of all possible number systems with corresponding 12-digit UPC - A numbering schema LLLLLLRRRRRR , where L denotes number system digit and R check digit .
0–1 , 6–9 :
For most products .
The LLLLL digits are the manufacturer code ( assigned by local GS1 organization ) , and the RRRRR digits are the product code .
2 :
Reserved for local use ( store / warehouse ) , for items sold by variable weight .
Variable - weight items , such as meats , fresh fruits , or vegetables , are assigned an item number by the store , if they are packaged there .
In this case , the LLLLL is the item number , and the RRRRR is either the weight or the price , with the first R determining which ( 0 for weight ) .
3
: Drugs by National Drug Code ( NDC ) number .
Pharmaceuticals in the U.S. use the middle 10 digits of the UPC as their NDC number .
Though usually only over - the - counter drugs are scanned at point of sale , NDC - based UPCs are used on prescription drug packages and surgical products and , in this case , are commonly called UPN Codes .
4 : Reserved for local use ( store / warehouse ) , often for loyalty cards or store coupons .
5
: Coupons .
The LLLLL digits are the manufacturer code , the first three RRR are a family code ( set by manufacturer ) , and the next two RR are a coupon code , which determines the amount of the discount .
These coupons can be doubled or tripled .
CHECK DIGIT CALCULATION Section::::Check digit calculation .
The UPC includes a check digit to detect common data entry errors .
For example , UPC - A codes choose the check digit formula_1 to satisfy the check digit equation :
If an entered code does not satisfy the equation , then it is not a valid UPC - A.
The UPC - A check digit may be calculated as follows :
* Sum the digits at odd - numbered positions ( first , third , fifth ... , eleventh ) .
* * Multiply the result by 3 .
*
* Add the digit sum at even - numbered positions ( second , fourth , sixth ... , tenth ) to the result .
*
* Find the result
modulo 10
( i.e. the remainder , when divided by 10 ) and call it .
*
* If is zero , then the check digit is 0 ; otherwise the check digit is .
*
For example , in a UPC - A barcode " 03600029145x " , where is the unknown check digit , may be calculated by :
* Sum the odd - numbered digits ( 0 + 6 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 5 = 14 ) .
*
* Multiply the result by 3 ( 14 × 3 = 42 ) .
*
* Add the even - numbered digits ( 42 + ( 3 + 0 + 0 + 9 + 4 ) = 58 ) .
*
* Find the result
modulo 10 ( 58 mod 10 = 8 = M ) .
*
* If is not 0 , subtract from 10 ( ) .
*
Thus , the check digit is 2 .
The check digit equation is selected to have reasonable error detection properties ( see Luhn algorithm ) .
* UPC - A can detect 100 % of single digit errors .
A single digit error means exactly one digit is wrong .
Let the difference modulo 10 of the erroneous digit and the correct digit be .
The value of can not be zero because that means the digits are the same , but can be any other value in { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 } .
If the error digit is in an odd position ( weight 1 ) , the left hand side of check digit equation changes by and the equivalence is no longer zero .
If the error digit is in an even position ( weight 3 ) , then the left hand side changes by , but that change is also nonzero modulo 10 , so the check digit equation is not satisfied .
* UPC - A can detect about 89 % of transposition errors .
Specifically , if and only if the difference between two adjacent digits is 5 , the UPC - A ca n't detect their transposition .
*
If 2 neighboring digits are transposed , then one of the digits will be weighted by 1 , and the other digit will be weighted by 3 , where is the difference between the two digits .
If the digits were in their correct order , they would contribute * formula_3 to the left hand side of the check digit equation .
In the transposed order , they contribute formula_4 . to the LHS .
Subtracting the two contributions gives how much they change the LHS : formula_5 An error will be detected as long as the modular change is nonzero ; if modulo 10 , then the change will not be detected .
Consequently , only when the character difference will an error be undetected ( when the degenerate " transposition " is not an error ) .
*
Next consider how often a transposition has a distance of 5 .

Sum VARIATIONS Section::::Variations .
UPC in its most common usage technically refers to UPC - A. Other variants of the UPC exist : * UPC - B is a 12-digit version of UPC with no check digit , developed for the National Drug Code ( NDC ) and National Health Related Items Code .
It has 11 digits plus a 1-digit product code , and is not in common use .
* UPC - C is a 12-digit code with a product code and a check digit ; not in common use .
* UPC - D is a variable length code ( 12 digits or more ) with the 12th digit being the check digit .
These versions are not in common use .
* UPC - E is a 6-digit code , that has its equivalent in UPC - A 12-digit code with number system 0 or 1 .
*
UPC-2 is a 2-digit supplement to the UPC used to indicate the edition of a magazine or periodical .
* UPC-5 is a 5-digit supplement to the UPC used to indicate suggested retail price for books .
As the UPC becomes technologically obsolete , it is expected that UPC - B and UPC - C will disappear from common use by the 2010s .
The UPC - D standard may be modified into EAN 2.0 or be phased out entirely .
UPC - E Section::::UPC - E.
To allow the use of UPC barcodes on smaller packages , where a full 12-digit barcode may not fit , a ' zero - suppressed ' version of UPC was developed , called UPC - E , in which the number system digit , all trailing zeros in the manufacturer code , and all leading zeros in the product code , are suppressed ( omitted ) .
This symbology differs from UPC - A in that it only uses a 6-digit code , does not use M ( middle ) guard pattern , and the E ( end ) guard pattern is formed as space - bar - space - bar - space - bar , i.e.
UPC - E barcode follows the pattern SDDDDDDE .
The way in which a 6-digit UPC - E relates to a 12-digit UPC - A , is determined by UPC - E numerical pattern and UPC - E parity pattern .
It can only correspond to UPC - A number system 0 or 1 , the value of which , along with the UPC - A check digit , determines the UPC - E parity pattern of the encoding .
With the manufacturer code digits represented by X 's , and product code digits by N 's , then : !

UPC - E 654321 with " EOEOEO " parity pattern ( UPC - A 065100004327 ) would be encoded as 1 - 1 - 1 4 - 1 - 1 - 1 1 - 2 - 3 - 1 2 - 3 - 1 - 1 1 - 4 - 1 - 1 2 - 2 - 1 - 2 2 - 2 - 2 - 1 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 .
The barcode would look like this : EAN-13 Section::::EAN-13 .
The EAN-13 was developed as a superset of UPC - A , adding an extra digit to the beginning of every UPC - A number .
This expanded the number of unique values theoretically possible by ten times to 1 trillion .
EAN-13 barcodes also indicate the country in which the company that sells the product is based ( which may or may not be the same as the country in which the good is manufactured ) .
The three leading digits of the code determine this , according to the GS1 country codes .
Every UPC - A code can be easily converted to the equivalent EAN-13 code by prepending 0 digit to the UPC - A code .
This does not change the check digit .
All point - of - sale systems can now understand both equally .
EAN-8 is an 8-digit variation of the EAN barcode .
UPC usage notes : *
All products marked with an EAN will be accepted in North America currently , in addition to those already marked with a UPC .
* Products with an existing UPC do not have to be re - marked with an EAN .
*
In North America , the EAN adds 30 % more codes , mainly by adding digits 10 through 12 to the UPC digits 00 through 09 .
This is a powerful incentive to phase out the UPC .
