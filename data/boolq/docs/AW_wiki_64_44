THE NANNY
The Nanny is an American television sitcom which originally aired on CBS from 1993 to 1999 , starring Fran Drescher as Fran Fine , a Jewish fashion queen from Flushing , New York who becomes the nanny of three children from the New York / British high society .
The show was created and produced by Drescher and her husband Peter Marc Jacobson , taking much of its inspiration from Drescher 's personal life growing up in Queens , involving names and characteristics based on her relatives and friends .
The show earned a Rose d'Or and one Emmy Award , out of a total of twelve nominations , and Drescher was twice nominated for a Golden Globe and an Emmy .
The sitcom has also spawned several foreign adaptations , loosely inspired by the original scripts .
PLOT Section::::Plot .
Jewish - American Fran Fine turns up on the doorstep of British Broadway producer Maxwell Sheffield ( Charles Shaughnessy ) to sell cosmetics after having been both dumped and fired by her boyfriend and employer Danny Imperialli .
Instead , she finds herself the nanny of Maxwell 's three children : Maggie , Brighton , and Grace .
Maxwell Sheffield is unhappy about it at first , but Fran turns out to be just what he and his family needed .
While Fran Fine manages the children , butler Niles ( Daniel Davis ) manages the household and watches all the events that unfold with Fran as the new nanny .
Niles , recognizing Fran 's gift for bringing warmth back to the family , does his best to undermine Maxwell 's business partner C.C. Babcock ( Lauren Lane ) who has her eyes on the very available Maxwell Sheffield .
Niles is often seen making witty comments directed towards C.C. , with C.C. often replying with a comment of her own in their ongoing game of one - upmanship .
As the series progresses , it becomes increasingly obvious that Maxwell is smitten with Fran even though he wo n't admit it , and Fran is smitten with him .
The show teases the viewers with their closeness and " near misses " as well as with an engagement .
Towards the later seasons , they finally marry and expand their family by having fraternal twins .
By the end of the series , it 's also clear that Niles and C.C. 's constant sharp barbs are their bizarre form of flirtation ; after a few false starts ( including multiple impulsive and failed proposals from Niles ) , the pair marry in the series finale .
EPISODES MAIN CHARACTERS Section::::Main characters .
Fran Fine is the nasal - voiced , outgoing protagonist of the series who stumbles upon the Sheffields ' doorstep and winds up as the nanny to Mr. Sheffield 's three children : Maggie , Brighton , and Grace .
She starts off working for her boyfriend Danny Imperialli in a bridal shop but is dumped and fired not long after .
She ends up meeting Maxwell Sheffield and his family while going door to door to sell cosmetics .
Her character has an outgoing and humorous personality .
Fran , as a result of her mother 's overbearing personality , often feels the need to date and is compelled to get married as well .
She is usually seen getting into trouble and having to solve those problems through using her street smarts .
Maxwell Sheffield is the male protagonist who ends up hiring Fran Fine to watch over his three children , Maggie , Brighton , and Grace .
He is a widowed Broadway producer , having lost his wife Sara four years before the start of the series .
While he does have some success as a Broadway producer , he remains constantly in the shadow of his rival Andrew Lloyd Webber , who always seems to have the upper hand .
He does not spend a lot of time with his children due to his busy schedule , hence he ends up hiring Fran Fine as the children 's nanny .
Despite his mutual attraction to Fran , he tries to keep their relationship professional for fear of commitment .
Margaret Sheffield is the eldest child of Maxwell Sheffield .
She is constantly seen bickering with her brother , Brighton , who views her as a nerd .
While she is constantly fighting with Brighton , her relationship with her sister , Grace , is more one of mentorship .
Towards the beginning of the series , Maggie is shy and awkward but , with Fran 's influence , she becomes a somewhat popular young woman .
Upon meeting Fran Fine , the two bond almost instantly .
Brighton Sheffield is the middle child of the family and the only son of Maxwell Sheffield .
Due to being the only son , he often feels left out .
This causes him to purposely bring about trouble for his two sisters .
He does n't bond with Fran Fine at first , having disliked all his previous nannies , but eventually becomes close with her as well .
He plans to become a Broadway producer , like his father .
Grace Sheffield is the youngest child in the Sheffield family .
She has a habit of naming medical conditions and complicated words .
When Fran first became her nanny , Grace was in therapy .
But , under Fran Fine 's influence and guidance , she eventually does n't need therapy any more .
As the two became close to one another Grace started picking up some of Fran 's Jewish slang and dressing habits , eventually thinking of Fran as a mother to her .
C.C. Babcock is the egocentric business partner of Maxwell Sheffield , with whom she has been working for almost 20 years .
She clearly wants him as more than a business partner .
Maxwell , however , appears oblivious and Babcock has yet to make a serious move on him .
She never seems to be able to remember the names of Maxwell 's three children .
From her first meeting with Fran Fine , she accurately views the newly hired nanny as a threat and tries to undermine her .
Fran is not C.C. 's only enemy in the Sheffield house , as she has an even more contentious relationship with his longtime butler Niles ( who hates her just as much as she hates him ) .
Niles is the loyal butler and chauffeur for the Sheffield family .
He and Maxwell have known each other their whole lives .
He bonds with Fran Fine immediately , viewing her as the breath of fresh air that the Sheffield family needs .
Niles is known as the household snoop as he is constantly seen listening in on conversations via intercoms , keyholes , and even in the very rooms where the conversations are taking place .
He tends to manipulate events in Fran 's favor to undermine C.C. , his nemesis .
In spite of this , over time it becomes clear that Niles has himself fallen for C.C. and their contentious relationship is a cover for mutual lust .

Following the pilot , the theme changed to " The Nanny Named Fran " , written by Ann Hampton Callaway and performed by her and her sister Liz Callaway .
Two instrumental versions of the theme song were used in the closing credits : one that is a direct instrumental version of the theme ( used only in a few season one episodes ) , and another with a slightly different arrangement .
OPENING CREDITS Section::::Opening credits .
The opening sequence for the pilot featured Fran in front of a white background , getting herself made up going to work as the nanny ; at the end of the sequence , it shows Fran heading toward a stroller and
a lipstick print appears to the above right .
Along with the change of the theme song from " If My Friends Could See Me Now " to " The Nanny Named Fran " came the change of the opening sequence , which like the theme , describes ( with the main characters in animated form )
the story of how Fran Fine went from being fired from the bridal shop by Danny Imperiali to becoming the nanny of the Sheffield children .
The opening sequence remained the same even though Renée Taylor , Ann Guilbert and Rachel Chagall began to be credited as " starring " in the in - show credits beginning in season five .
The only change to the sequence was in season six when producer Kathy Landsberg was promoted to co - executive producer of the series as her producer credit was moved to the in - show credits , while the creator credits of Drescher and Jacobson , and the developer credits of Sternin and Fraser were added in its place .
The animated opening sequence begins with Fran Fine walking into the bridal shop , only to be kicked out by Danny Imperalli .
Then , she hitches a ride in a cab , crosses the bridge from Queens , New York to Manhattan and arrives at the Sheffield mansion .
Maxwell Sheffield opens the door and observes Fran .
Then , he pulls her inside and she falls into the flower pot .
Niles dusts her off and puts a cap on her head that reads Nanny .
Fran whistles for Maggie , Brighton and Gracie and the four of them form a conga line .
C.C. arrives at the door and Fran bumps the door with her hip to close it in her face .
Finally , the Sheffields , Niles and Fran gather on the couch for a group picture similar to that of the One Day at a Time series opening .
However , when Fran presses the camera 's button , smoke emits from the camera , covering the entire group in dust and messing up their best clothes .
Rosie O'Donnell employed the same team that created The Nannys opening credits to do the opening credits for her popular daytime talk show .
O'Donnell mentioned this in an interview with Drescher on that show .

PRODUCTION
DEVELOPMENT Section::::Production .
Section::::Development .
The Nanny began in 1991 with a chance meeting on a transatlantic flight between Drescher and Jeff Sagansky , at the time president of CBS Corporation , for whom she had starred in the short - lived TV series Princesses .
Drescher persuaded Sagansky to let her and her then - husband Jacobson pitch an idea for a sitcom to CBS .
Sagansky agreed to a future meeting once all of the parties were back in Los Angeles ; however , neither Drescher nor Jacobson had any idea what to pitch .
Later , while in London , Drescher was visiting friend Twiggy Lawson and her family in London , England , where she went on a culture - clash shopping tour with Lawson 's then teenage daughter .
Drescher was inspired by her behavior towards the teenage daughter on the shopping trip as functioning in a less parental but " humorous [ ... ] kind of Queens logic , self - serving advice " mode .
Drescher immediately called her husband in Los Angeles with her sitcom idea , which she pitched as a spin on The Sound of Music , except , in Drescher 's words : " Instead of Julie Andrews , I come to the door . "
Jacobson replied : " That could be it " and the idea for The Nanny was spawned .
Back in Los Angeles , the pair pitched their idea to Tim Flack and Joe Voci , both in comedy development at CBS .
Sagansky brought in experienced producers Robert Sternin and Prudence Fraser , another husband - and - wife team with whom Drescher had worked before while guesting on
Who 's the Boss ?
in 1985 and 1986 .
Interested , both couples teamed up to write the script for the pilot together , creating a character with the intention to build off Drescher 's image .
" Our business strategy was to create a show that was going to complement our writing , complement me as a talent , " Drescher said in a 1997 interview with The Hollywood Reporter .
As a result , the characters draw deeply on the Drescher family , including Fran Fine 's parents , Sylvia and Morty , and grandmother Yetta , who all were named after their real - life counterparts .
Drescher also drew from her own life in creating her character .
Like the character in The Nanny , Drescher was born and raised in Flushing , Queens , and attended beauty school .
However , unlike her on - screen counterpart , Drescher never worked in a bridal shop ; Drescher wrote that into the character as a tribute to her mother , who did work in a bridal shop .
While visiting with his relatives in Fort Lauderdale around the holidays , Sagansky watched a few episodes with his relatives , realized that he had a hit , and ordered a full 22 episodes for the first season .
CREW Section::::Crew .
Most of the early episodes of The Nanny were shot in front of a live studio audience on Stage 6 at the Culver Studios .
During later seasons the taping was no longer performed before an audience due to the complexities of the fantasy sequences , costume changes , etc .
On Mondays , the cast went through the script as a table read .
On Tuesdays and Wednesdays , they rehearsed before the series ' producers and executives .
And , on Thursdays and Fridays , the series was shot using a multi - camera set up in front of a live studio audience .
Nearly 100 crew members were involved in the shooting of a single episode .
Although Drescher , Fraser , Jacobson and Sternin , the show 's only executive producers for the first four seasons , coordinated " pretty much everything " at the beginning , according to Sternin , they eventually found their niche and in the following years , Drescher and Sternin decided to focus on writing story outlines along with Timothy Kavanagh of Montreal .
Kavanagh , known mainly for his writing with Fraser , added a recognizable dry humor to the show .
Jacobson presided over the writing team , and Fraser observed the run - throughs .
The four of them were later joined by Frank Lombardi , Caryn Lucas and Diane Wilk , who served as the series ' executive producer throughout the fifth and sixth season respectively .
PROFESSIONAL LAUGHERS Section::::Professional laughers .
Stemming from a home invasion and attack she experienced in 1985 , Fran Drescher requested the show to provide prescreened audiences , based fear of having random strangers invited to the productions .
The show hired Central Casting to gather a cast of " laughers " who would be recorded during taping .
The audio track of the laughers would then be added to the episodes in post - production .
Casting director Lisette St. Claire became the world 's first " laugher wrangler " for new type of service , which would continue to be used on other shows .
HUMOR
Section::::Humor .
The comedy in The Nanny was formulated with many running gags , which contributed heavily to the success of the series .
Much of this formula was character - based , with all major characters possessing a specific trait or quirks that provided a source of parody for other characters .
The conflicting elements of each character 's own comedy were often played off against one another ( Fran and Maxwell , Niles and C.C. , Maggie and Brighton ) .
Occasionally the characters would break the fourth wall and comment on the situations themselves , or Fran would comment to the audience or look into the camera .
Other running gags are the many references to Beatles songs and the musicals Fiddler on the Roof and My Fair Lady .
Most of the humor Fran uses is aimed toward a Jewish audience .
She makes references to Yiddish words and teaches the Sheffield children to be stereotypical Jews ( to never pay retail price , to go after men like doctors , etc . )
Much of this humor is featured in scenes including her mother Sylvia .
At times , they would also make humorous references to the stars ' previous careers or real life off - screen time .
This was noticeable when Yetta saw her reflection in the mirror and thought she was seeing Millie Helper from The Dick Van Dyke Show ( the role that Guilbert played on that long - running show ) , Maxwell remembering how he wanted to hire a former cast member from Days of Our Lives but thought he was n't " British " enough ( a reference to Charles Shaughnessy 's former series ) , C.C. using props to hide Lauren Lane 's real - life pregnancy at the time , and Fran meeting her idol — Fran Drescher — who gave her a hint on what she ( the TV Fran ) was going to do in the next scene in the second - to - last episode in the last season .
Drescher also appeared in the series as tough - talking music publicist Bobbi Fleckman , reprising her role from the 1984 film This Is Spinal Tap , setting up an obvious visual gag where Drescher ( as the Nanny ) would disguise herself as Fleckman in order to get Mr. Sheffield 's attention .
More running gags include Fran 's frequent references to classic TV sitcoms ( such as Gilligan 's Island and Bewitched ) and her many eccentric family members ( some never shown , most of them dying ) ;
Fran lying about her age — especially to men ; Maxwell fighting through his rivalry with actual Broadway producer Andrew Lloyd Webber ; Maxwell 's physical resemblance to Pierce Brosnan ; Maxwell 's fondness of Kaye Ballard ; Sylvia loving food in excess ; Niles delivering sharp one - liners , often aimed at C.C. ; C.C. cold - heartedly reacting to situations that are usually sentimental to others ( e.g. the death of Bambi 's mother ) ; Gracie psychologically analyzing various situations ; Niles getting fired because he embarrasses Maxwell or gives Fran ideas that Maxwell extremely dislikes ( such as suggesting that Max , C.C. and Fran go to Barbra Streisand 's house ) ; Fran and Val lacking intelligence and obsessing over material possessions ( e.g. clothes ) ; frequent references to Fran 's flamboyant wardrobe and her " big hair " ; Fran frequently mentioning shopping at Loehmann 's ; Yetta making disconnected comments revealing her senility ; Fran criticizing Maxwell 's and Niles ' reserved and inhibited British nature ; Brighton morphing into a hopeless dork ; Fran 's attraction to Jewish males ; Maxwell passing up the incredibly popular musical , Cats , then becoming upset when such an idiotic idea became a success ; Niles ' last name never being revealed ; C.C. covering her long - unrevealed name ( finally given as Chastity Claire in the series finale ) ; C.C. failing to remember the names of the Sheffield children ( even convinced by Niles in one episode that there was a fourth child named Sydney ; note : she did n't have trouble remembering in the early seasons ) ; Sylvia constantly nagging Fran to get married ; Fran finding solace in food when she 's depressed ; Fran 's father , Morty , often featured in the series but never actually seen ( until portrayed by Steve Lawrence in a few later episodes ) ; Morty 's only physical trait being the fact that he is bald , in which he is always comically losing his wig , and has several head mannequins to hold different wigs ; Niles offering obvious hints to Maxwell and Fran about them realizing they should be together and hints from each other ;
C.C. pining over her unrequited romantic interest in Maxwell ; C.C. developing a nervous tic and eventually ending up in a sanitarium ; Fran obsessing with Barbra Streisand .
There was also the occasional tryst between Niles and C.C. , contrasting with their typical open disdain for each other , which was actually love .
Season 4 featured a running gag where both Fran and Maxwell kept secret from the other household members " The Thing " ( the fact that in the season 3 finale Maxwell tells Fran he loves her , but then in the Season 4 premiere he takes it back ) .
It 's also following " The Thing " that whenever Maxwell makes comments denying he has feelings for Fran , she is temporary " paralyzed "
( she ca n't feel her arm , her entire left side shuts down , etc . ) .
In addition , there is also a great deal of physical comedy in The Nanny including exaggerated falls and chases .
Drescher 's facial expressions , when shocked or surprised , can also be seen as reminiscent of Lucille Ball 's portrayals of Lucy Ricardo and Lucy Carmichael .
The parallels were suggested in a few episodes , where an exasperated Mr. Sheffield refers to Fran as " Mrs. Carmichael " , and asks in another : " Mr. Mooney fire you from the bank again ? "
Another Lucy reference ( in which the family travels to Hollywood ) is when he alludes to Fran and " Ethel " stealing John Wayne 's footprints , and again when Maxwell says " Miss Fine , you got ' some ' splaining to do ! "
like Ricky Ricardo often said to Lucy Ricardo .
The episode that featured a visit from Elizabeth Taylor ( who also appeared on
Here 's Lucy as a guest star )
began with Maxwell and Niles trying to hide the visit from Fran ( " Boys , boys , boys .
Now do you think my mother gave birth to a dummy 25 years ago ? " ) followed by her gripe " You never introduce me to any of the stars that you know ; I 've got a good mind to take Little Ricky and ...
oh .
Never mind . "
Also , there was a reference from the episode of I Love Lucy called " Ricky has Labor Pains " where Lucy and Ethel dress up like men and go to Ricky 's daddy shower .
In an episode of The Nanny , Fran sees a man watching I Love Lucy on TV and as the theme song plays she gets a sneaky look on her face and gets the idea to gain entry into Mr. Sheffield 's men 's only club dressed as a man .
Viewers for Quality Television called The Nanny " the ' 90s version of I Love Lucy .
It was well written and entertaining . "
IMPACT RECEPTION
Section::::Impact .
Section::::Reception .
The show performed poorly in its first year .
When it was nearly canceled , Sagansky stepped in as its champion .
According to Jacobson : " At all those affiliate meetings , he used to say , ' Stick by The Nanny ! '
He knew it was something special .
" The sitcom was the first new show delivered to CBS for the 1993 season and the highest - tested pilot at the network in years .
The series was also hugely successful internationally , especially in Australia , where it was one of the highest - rated programs during the mid - to - late 1990s .
Although soon emerging as a favorite among the company , sponsors questioned whether the writers had ventured too far in terms of ethnicity and Drescher acted too obviously Jewish .
The actress , however , declined to change Fran Fine into an Italian American : " On TV , you have to work fast , and the most real , the most rooted in reality to me is Jewish .
I wanted to do it closest to what I knew .
" By contrast , the producers came to the conclusion that to oppose her should be a family of British origin , so " she would n't come across as Jewish so much as the American you were rooting for , " Sternin explained .
" The idea was to make her the American girl who happens to be Jewish rather than the Jewish girl working for the WASPs . " REUNION SPECIAL Section::::Reunion special . !
