AIR GUN LAWS
This is a list of laws concerning air guns by country .
While in some countries air guns are not subject to any specific regulation , in most there are laws , which differ widely .
Each jurisdiction has its own definition of an air gun ; and regulations may vary for weapons of different bore , muzzle energy or velocity , or material of ammunition , with guns designed to fire metal pellets often more tightly controlled than airsoft weapons .
There may be minimum ages for possession , and sales of both air guns and ammunition may be restricted .
Some areas in the world require permits and background checks similar to those required for firearms proper .
AUSTRALIA Section::::Australia .
The Australian gun law is quite restrictive and differs on a state - by - state basis ; however , as general rule all air guns — regardless of action type , caliber and muzzle energy — are considered firearms for legal purposes ; e.g. air rifles are considered Class A firearms and as such are subject to licensing and registration .
Air pistols are considered handguns and subjected to Class H firearms restrictions .
An air pistol shooter will require membership and attendance at an authorized pistol club for six months before allowing ownership , and need to shoot in at least ten events per year — four for each handgun class ( air pistol , rimfire or centerfire ) — including at least six formal competitions to keep the licence .
Paintball markers are classified as " soft air weapons " and treated differently to other air guns ; refer to the paintball section on legality for a state - by - state breakdown .
Though also regarded as " soft air weapons " , airsoft guns are strictly prohibited in all states except in the Northern Territory ( where they are considered regular airguns and subjected to the corresponding laws and licensing ) and the ACT ( where they are considered " imitation firearms " ) .
BRAZIL
Section::::Brazil .
The Brazilian legislation that regulates the manufacture , import , export , trade , traffic and use of airguns divide them into two groups :
* airguns by spring action or pre - compressed air ( PCP - Pre Charged Pneumatic ) of up to 6 mm calibre ;
* airguns by spring action or pre - compressed air ( PCP - Pre Charged Pneumatic ) of calibre exceeding 6 mm ; or pre - compressed gases that is not breathable air , such as CO2 and others , in any calibre .
Airguns in the first group may be purchased by anyone over 18 .
Airguns in the second group can only be purchased by people registered in the army , transportation depends on authorization , and usage is allowed only in places approved by the army .
Airguns of any kind may not be carried openly .
There is no muzzle energy limit for any type or calibre .
Scopes or any equipment with magnification needs to be registered by the army in the shooter 's registry and accompany a traffic authorization , and are allowed to civilians only if under 6 times magnification and with the objective lens smaller than 36 millimeters .
Scopes with magnification equal or above 6 times and/or over 35 milimeters , or equipment that mark the target ( like laser sights ) , are restricted to civilians and allowed only for use by the army .
The permitted equipment has to be registered in the civilian 's document , this process is called " Apostilamento " .
The document for a shooter 's registry is called " Certificado de Registro de Atirador " .
BELGIUM Section::::Belgium .
Air guns can be freely bought and owned by any person older than 18 years old .
Only pistols with muzzle energy exceeding are not allowed .
There is no maximum muzzle energy limit for rifles .

BULGARIA Section::::Bulgaria .
In Bulgaria anyone over the age of 18 can obtain an airgun if its muzzle energy is below that of 24 Joules .
Weapons can not be bought online .
CANADA Section::::Canada .
Air guns with both a muzzle velocity greater than 152.4 meters per second ( 500 feet per second ) and a muzzle energy greater than 5.7 joules ( 4.2 foot - pounds ) are firearms for purposes of both the Firearms Act and the Criminal Code .
Usually the manufacturer 's specifications are used to determine the design muzzle velocity and energy .
Air rifles that meet these velocity and energy criteria are generally classified as non - restricted firearms ; however , some are classified as restricted or prohibited , depending on the exact design of the air rifle .
Air pistols are classified as restricted if their barrel is longer than 105 mm or prohibited if their barrel length is 105 mm or less .
The lawful possession of these airguns requires that the owner have a valid firearms licence and that the airgun be registered as a firearm .
Air guns that meet the Criminal Code definition of a firearm , but that are deemed not to be firearms for certain purposes of the Firearms Act and Criminal Code are those that have a muzzle velocity of less than 152.4 meters per second ( 500 feet per second ) and/or a maximum muzzle energy of 5.7 joules ( 4.2 foot pounds ) .
Such air guns are exempt from licensing , registration , and other requirements under the Firearms Act , and from penalties set out in the Criminal Code for possessing a firearm without a valid licence or registration certificate .
However , they are considered to be firearms under the Criminal Code if they are used to commit a crime .
The simple possession , acquisition and use of these air guns for lawful purposes is regulated by provincial and municipal laws and by - laws .
For example , some provinces may have set a minimum age for acquiring such an air gun .
These air guns are exempt from the specific safe storage , transportation and handling requirements set out in the regulations supporting the Firearms Act .
However , the Criminal Code requires that reasonable precautions be taken to use , carry , handle , store , transport , and ship them in a safe and secure manner .
Carrying one of these firearms is permitted for those aged 14 or older .
Suppressors for all firearms , including airguns , are prohibited in Canada .
CZECH REPUBLIC Section::::Czech Republic .
In the Czech Republic anyone over age of 18 can acquire air gun with a muzzle energy not exceeding .
Children over age of 10 have to be supervised by adult when shooting .
The only restriction on shooting place is requirement of public safety .
Since firearms can be used only at the officially licensed shooting ranges air guns became popular to practice target shooting at or near the home .
Air guns with a muzzle energy over require the same licence as firearms and police registration .
Such air guns can be used only at the shooting ranges .
FRANCE Section::::France .
Since September 2013 , air rifles with a muzzle energy less than 20 joules ( 14 ft lbf ) can be acquired by persons over age 18 and no licence is required .
( Previously the limit was 10 joules . )
For air rifles of 20 joules muzzle energy or more , a hunting licence or club shooting licence is required .
However , hunting or pest control with air guns is illegal in France .
GERMANY
Section::::Germany .
In Germany , air guns producing a muzzle energy up to 7.5 joule ( J ) ( 5.53 ft·lbf ) can be owned by persons from the age of 18 years and freely acquired provided they bear the " F - in - pentagon " mark " that indicates a muzzle energy not exceeding kinetic energy .
Carrying air guns in public necessitates a carry permit ( § 10 Abs .
4 WaffG ) , extremely rare as such and never granted for air guns .
Only the transportation of unloaded and non - accessible air guns ( or carrying unloaded during biathlon ) is considered a " permissible carry " ( § 12 Abs .

The minimum age for air gun shooting in Germany is 12 years under supervision ( § 27 Abs .
3 S. 1
Nr . 1
WaffG ) , but exceptions may be granted to younger children upon request , supported by suitable references from a doctor and by a licensed shooting federation ( § 27 Abs .
4 WaffG ) .
Air weapons exceeding 7.5 J muzzle energy , e.g. field target guns , are treated like firearms and therefore require a relevant permit for acquisition and possession .
Proof of need , a clean criminal record and the passing of a knowledge and handling test are required ( § 4 Abs .
1 WaffG ) to gain the permit .
A purchase authorization is not required for air guns that were manufactured and introduced onto the market before 1 January 1970 in Germany or before 2 April 1991 on the territory of the former East Germany ( WaffG , Appendix 2 , Section 1 , Subsection 2 , 1.2 ) ; they can , regardless of their muzzle energy or the absence of an " F - in - pentagon " mark , be freely acquired and possessed .

ITALY Section::::Italy .
In Italy , any mechanism that produces a muzzle energy higher than 1 joule ( 0.74 ft·lbf ) and lower than 7.5 joules ( 5.53 ft·lbf ) is considered a " low - power air gun " ; the sale of such instruments is open to anyone over 18 years of age without licence or registration , but it can take place only in authorized gun shops where the owner must require the purchaser to provide his ID Card as a proof of age .
Any device developing a muzzle energy equal to , or higher than , 7.5 joules is considered a " high - power air gun " , requiring Police licensing and registration for purchase and detention just like any firearm .
Bows , crossbows and similar are exempt from this rule .
The muzzle energy of such devices is certified by a governance office called " Banco di Prova " .
Air guns developing less than 1 joule of muzzle energy are categorized as airsoft , which are considered by law as toys , with no restriction whatsoever to their trade , except that they can never be modified to achieve a higher muzzle energy and must be only able to shoot 6 mm plastic pellets .
It is illegal to hunt with air guns .
NETHERLANDS
Section::::Netherlands .
In the Netherlands , air guns can be owned by persons from the age of 18 years and can freely be acquired .
Until 1997 there were limitations on muzzle velocity and kinetic energy , similar to the German law , but these restrictions were lifted for practical reasons .
Carrying air guns in public and the possession of air guns ( and toy guns ) that resemble firearms is prohibited .
The expression " to resemble " is nowadays given a very broad interpretation so that just about any airgun can be considered to resemble a firearm .
Whether an airgun is considered to resemble a firearm too closely is decided by the police or , when it comes to that , by the court .
It is impossible to predict the outcome of such courtcases .
Air guns may be kept in private homes but must be inaccessible for persons under 18 .
Commercial sales of airguns may only take place in licensed gunshops .
It is illegal to own an airgun that was " produced or modified so that it can more easily be carried concealed " .

Airguns can not be fully automatic , and there is provision under the New Zealand Arms Acts to specify " specially dangerous airguns " .
Only pre - charged pneumatic rifles have now been specified in this category , but for these a firearms licence is now a requirement for possession and use .
The change was made as a consequence of two fatal shootings by .22 calibre semi - automatic air rifles .
POLAND Section::::Poland .
In Poland it is possible to freely acquire air guns with a muzzle energy not exceeding .
Air guns with muzzle energy

J. UNITED KINGDOM Section::::United Kingdom .
Air pistols generating more than 6 ft·lbf ( 8.1 J ) and air rifles generating more than 12 ft·lbf ( 16.2 J ) of muzzle energy are legally termed " specifically dangerous firearms " .
As a result , ownership of these air rifles requires the possession of a Firearm Certificate ( FAC ) ; however , ownership of such air pistols is prohibited as they are defined as " Prohibited Weapons " under Section 5 of the Firearms Act 1968 .
( Section 5 Authority is usually only granted to members of the Gun Trade . )
Pistols and rifles below these energy levels are still termed firearms and are dealt with under the Firearms Act , but do not require licensing in England and Wales , and may be purchased by anyone over the age of 18 .
Pistols and rifles under 0.737 ft·lbf ( 1 J ) are not included under firearms regulations in the UK but do fall under the VCR act .
In Northern Ireland any air rifle or air pistol generating more than 0.737 ft·lbf ( 1 J ) is considered a firearm and as such requires a FAC .
In Scotland , the Air Weapons and Licensing ( Scotland ) Act 2015 introduced an air weapon certificate in Scotland , which anyone owning an air weapon is now required to hold .

UNITED STATES Section::::United States .
The Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives states that : Although the federal government does not normally regulate air guns , some state and local governments do ; the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence has compiled a list of states and selected municipalities that regulate air guns , finding that 23 states and the District of Columbia regulate air guns to some degree .
Two states ( New Jersey and Rhode Island ) define all non - powder guns as firearms ; one state ( Illinois ) defines certain high - power and/or large calibre non - powder guns as firearms ; three states ( Connecticut , Delaware and North Dakota ) define non - powder guns as dangerous weapons ( but not firearms ) .
The remaining states which regulate air guns impose age restrictions on possession , use , or transfer of non - powder guns , and/or explicitly regulate possession of non - powder guns on school grounds .
New York City has a restrictive municipal ordinance regulating air guns .
Air guns were previously banned in San Francisco , but a state preemption statute struck down the ban , and the San Francisco District Attorney declared them legal as long as they are in compliance with state law .
