VICTORIA 'S SECRET Victoria 's Secret is an American designer , manufacturer , and marketer of women 's lingerie , womenswear , and beauty products .
Founded in 1977 as a response to packaged underwear , which the company 's founder considered to be " ugly , floral - print nylon nightgowns " , the company is now the largest American retailer of women 's lingerie .
HISTORY 1977–1981 Section::::History .
Section::::1977–1981 .
Victoria 's Secret was founded by Roy Raymond , and his wife Gaye Raymond , in San Francisco , California , on June 12 , 1977 .
Eight years prior to founding Victoria 's Secret , in the late 1960s , Raymond was embarrassed when purchasing lingerie for his wife at a department store .
Newsweek reported him looking back on the incident from the vantage of 1981 : " When I tried to buy lingerie for my wife , " he recalls , " I was faced with racks of terry - cloth robes and ugly floral - print nylon nightgowns , and I always had the feeling
the department store saleswomen thought I was an unwelcome intruder .
"
Raymond spent the next eight years studying the lingerie market .
At the time when Raymond founded Victoria 's Secret , most women in America purchased " dowdy " , " pragmatic " , " foundation garments " by Fruit of the Loom , Hanes , and Jockey in packs of three from department stores and saved " fancier items " for " special occasions " like honeymoons . "
Lacy thongs and padded push - up bras " were niche products during this period found " alongside feathered boas and provocative pirate costumes at Frederick 's of Hollywood " outside of the mainstream product offerings available at department stores .
In 1977 , Raymond borrowed $ 40,000 from his parents and $ 40,000 from a bank to establish Victoria 's Secret : a store in which men could feel comfortable buying lingerie .
The company 's first store was located in Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto , California .
Raymond picked the name " Victoria " after Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom to associate with the refinement of the Victorian era .
The " Secret " was what was hidden underneath the clothes .
The " angels " comes from his wife being in a sorority where their mascot was an angel .
Victoria 's Secret grossed $ 500,000 in its first year of business , enough to finance the expansion from a headquarters and warehouse to four new store locations and a mail - order operation .
By 1982 , the fourth store ( still in the San Francisco area ) was added at 395 Sutter Street .
Victoria 's Secret stayed at that location until 1990 , when it moved to the larger Powell Street frontage of the Westin St. Francis .
In April 1982 , Raymond sent out his 12th catalog ; each catalog cost $ 3 ( ) .
Catalog sales accounted for 55 % of the company 's $ 7 million annual sales in 1982 .
The Victoria 's Secret stores at this time were " a niche player " in the underwear market .
The business was described as " more burlesque than Main Street . " 1982–1983 Section::::1982–1983 .
In 1982 , Victoria 's Secret had grown to five stores , a 40-page catalog , and was grossing $ 6 million annually .
Raymond sold Victoria 's Secret Inc. to Leslie Wexner , creator of Limited Stores Inc of Columbus , Ohio , for $ 1 million .
In 1983 , Wexner revamped Victoria 's Secret 's sales model .
He discarded the money - losing model of selling lingerie to male customers and replaced it with one that focused on female customers .
Victoria 's Secret transformed from " more burlesque than Main Street " to a mainstay that sold broadly accepted underwear .
The " new colors , patterns and styles that promised sexiness packaged in a tasteful , glamorous way and with the snob appeal of European luxury " meant to appeal to female buyers .
To further this image , the Victoria 's Secret catalog continued the practice that Raymond began : listing the company 's headquarters on catalogs at a fake London address , with the real headquarters in Columbus , Ohio .
The stores were redesigned to evoke 19th century England .
Howard Gross took over as president from his position as vice - president in 1985 .
In October of that year , the Los Angeles Times reported that Victoria 's Secret was stealing market share from department stores ; in 1986 , Victoria 's Secret was the only national chain of lingerie stores .
The New York Times reported on Victoria 's Secret 's rapid expansion from four stores in 1982 to 100 in 1986 , and analysts ' expectations that it could expand to 400 by 1988 .
In 1987 , Victoria 's Secret was reportedly among the " best - selling catalogs " .
In 1990 , analysts estimated that sales had quadrupled in four years , making it one of the fastest growing mail - order businesses .
The New York Times described it as a " highly visible leader " , saying it used " unabashedly sexy high - fashion photography to sell middle - priced underwear .
" Victoria 's Secret also released their own line of fragrances in 1992 .
1990–2006
Section::::1990–2006 .
By the early 1990s , Victoria 's Secret faced a gap in management that led the company to be " plagued by persistent quality problems " .
Howard Gross , who had grown the company significantly since Wexner 's 1982 purchase , was moved to the poorly performing L Brands subsidiary Limited Stores .
Business Week reported that " both divisions have suffered " .
Grace Nichols , who became President and CEO beginning in 1992 , worked to resolve the quality problems ; their margins tightened , resulting in a slower growth of profits .
Victoria 's Secret introduced the Miracle Bra selling two million within the first year , but faced competition from Sara Lee 's WonderBra a year later .
The company responded with a TV campaign .
By 1998 , Victoria 's Secret 's market share of the intimate apparel market was 14 percent .
That year Victoria 's Secret also entered the $ 3.5 billion cosmetic market .
In 1999 , the company aimed to increase its coverage with the Body by Victoria brand .
In May 2000 , Wexner installed Sharen Jester Turney , previously of Neiman Marcus Direct , as the new chief executive of Victoria 's Secret Direct to turn around catalog sales that were lagging behind other divisions .
Forbes reported Turney stating , as she flipped through a Victoria 's Secret catalog , " We need to quit focusing on all that cleavage . "
In 2000 , Turney began to redefine Victoria 's Secret catalog from " breasts — spilling over the tops of black , purple and reptile - print underthings " to one that would appeal to an " upscale customer who now feels more comfortable buying La Perla or Wolford lingerie .
" ; " dimming the hooker looks " such as " tight jeans and stilettos " ; and moving from " a substitute for Playboy in some dorm rooms , " to something closer to a Vogue lifestyle layout , where lingerie , sleepwear , clothes and cosmetics appear throughout the catalog .
Beginning in 2000 , Grace Nichols , CEO of Victoria 's Secret Direct , led a similar change at Victoria 's Secret 's stores — moving away from an evocation of 1800s
England ( or a Victorian bordello ) .
2006–PRESENT
Section::::2006–present .
By 2006 , Victoria 's Secret 's 1,000 stores across the United States accounted for one third of all purchases in the intimate apparel industry .
In February 2016 , Turney stepped down as CEO of Victoria 's Secret after serving for a decade .
In 2016 , direct sales only grew 1.6 % and fell by 7.4 % in the last quarter of the year , typically a high revenue period due to the holidays .
The company discontinued its use of a print catalog and dropped certain categories of clothing such as swimwear .
Sales revenue continued to stagnate and drop in early 2017 .
In November 2018 , it was announced that CEO Jan Singer had resigned amid declining sales .
According to The Wall Street Journal , quarterly same - store sales in the last two years raised only once .
The announcement came one week after CMO Ed Razek made the controversial comment that the company does n't cast transgender or plus - size models in its annual fashion show " because the show is a fantasy . "

In 2017 Victoria 's Secret began to put more emphasis on bralettes ( bras without underwire , often intended to be worn visibly ) and sports bras ( under the Victoria Sport label ) to appeal to a younger customer base .

In 1982 the Victoria 's Secret catalog cost $ 3 .
The New York Times reported that the financial success of Victoria 's Secret catalogs influenced other catalogs , which changed to present lingerie as " romantic and sensual but tasteful " " in which models are photographed in ladylike poses against elegant backgrounds . "

Victoria 's Secret used the insert to announce their expansion into the toiletries and fragrance business .
Up until the ten - page insert , the company 's growth had been driven by their catalog , sporadic ads in fashion publications , and word of mouth .
Catalogs were discontinued in early 2016 .
MARKETING Section::::Marketing .
The Victoria 's Secret Fashion Show is an annual " elaborate marketing tool for Limited Brands " .
The show is a mix of " beautiful models scantily clad in lingerie " and A - list entertainers " And every year , it becomes less about fashion and more about show " .
The company gained notoriety in the early 1990s after it began to use supermodels in its advertising and fashion shows .
Throughout the 2000s , Victoria 's Secret has turned down celebrity models and endorsements .
In 1999 , Victoria 's Secret 's 30 second Super Bowl advertisement led to one million visits to the company 's website within an hour of airing .
In 2004 , Victoria 's Secret featured Bob Dylan in an advertisement to test new marketing possibilities while Victoria 's Secret dropped their fashion show for 2004 as a result of the fallout from the Janet Jackson / Super Bowl incident that caused complaints from women 's groups .
The company created a campaign to market its " Body " bra line called " The Perfect Body .
" The campaign has elicited substantial controversy , with many sources saying it will lower women 's self - esteem because it does not embrace all body types .
VICTORIA 'S SECRET FASHION SHOW
Section::::Victoria 's Secret Fashion Show .
In 1995 , Victoria 's Secret began holding their annual Victoria 's Secret Fashion Show , which is broadcast on primetime American television .
Starting with the 1995 fashion show , they are " a combination of self - assured strutting for women and voyeuristic pleasures for men — and lingerie becomes mainstream entertainment . "
Ken Weil , vice president at Victoria 's Secret , and Tim Plzak , responsible for IT at Victoria 's Secret 's parent company Intimate Brands , led Victoria 's Secret 's first - ever online streaming of their fashion show in 1999 .
The 18 minutes webcast streamed February 2 , 1999 , was at the time the Internet 's " biggest event " since inception .
The 1999 webcast was reported as a failure by a number of newspapers on account of some user 's inability to watch the show featuring Tyra Banks , Heidi Klum , and Stephanie Seymour as a result of Victoria 's Secret 's technology falling short being able to meet the online user demand resulting in network congestion and users who could see the webcast receiving jerky frames .
In all , the company 's website saw over 1.5 million visits while the Broadcast.com 's computer 's were designed to handle between 250,000 and 500,000 simultaneous viewers .
In total , 1.5 million viewers either attempted or viewed the webcast .
The 1999 webcast served to create a database for Victoria 's Secret of over 500,000 current and potential customers by requiring users to submit their contact details to view the webcast .
The next spring Victoria 's Secret avoided technical issues by partnering with Broadcast.com , America Online , and Microsoft .
The 2000 webcast attracted more than two million viewers .
By 2011 , the budget for the fashion show was $ 12 million up from the first show 's budget of $ 120,000 .
The show 's viewership has decreased dramatically over a five year period , losing around half of its viewers .
In 2013 , the audience numbered 9.7 million viewers , while in 2017 , it had 5 million viewers .
A potential reason is women 's changing perception of the company 's overall marketing .
Retail analyst Paul Lejuez stated " Women do n't want to be viewed as stereotypical sexy supermodels buying lingerie just to impress men . "
VICTORIA 'S SECRET ANGELS
Section::::Victoria 's Secret Angels .
Victoria 's Secret started working with renowned models in the early 1990s , with the hiring of Stephanie Seymour , Karen Mulder , Yasmeen Ghauri , and Jill Goodacre .
These models helped the brand gain notice and soon enough were featured in televised commercials .
Veronica Webb is one of the original Victoria 's Secret models .
Angels is one of Victoria 's Secret 's lingerie lines , which was launched in 1997 , with a commercial featuring Helena Christensen , Karen Mulder , Daniela Peštová , Stephanie Seymour , and Tyra Banks as well as pop star Tom Jones .
The commercial was a major success and the Angels began to be featured in various commercials , alongside other contract models for the brand such as Yasmeen Ghauri , Inés Rivero , and Laetitia Casta .
From then onwards , the term Angel started to become synonymous with being a contracted spokesmodel for the brand and in February 1998 , the Angels made their runway debut at Victoria 's Secret 's 4th annual fashion show , with Chandra North filling in for Christensen .
Seymour , Mulder , Pestova , Banks , Casta , and new brazilian model Millena Gomes were all featured in both of Victoria 's Secret webcast and took part in the promotion as the brand 's contract models .
Starting 2001 , the show has been televised and usually features the year 's Angel line - up at the start of the show , starting with Pestova , Banks , Klum , Adriana Lima and Gisele Bundchen
In 2004 , due to the Super Bowl controversy , instead of a televised show , Victoria 's Secret sent its five contract models ( Banks , Klum , Bundchen , Adriana Lima , and Alessandra Ambrosio ) on a tour called Angels Across America , as by then , the word had become synonymous with Victoria 's Secret spokesmodels .
The last original Angel , Tyra Banks , departed the following year , as Karolina Kurkova , Selita Ebanks , and Izabel Goulart were hired .
Among other recognitions , the Victoria 's Secret Angels were chosen to be part of People magazine 's annual " 100 Most Beautiful People in the World
" issue in 2007 and became the first trademark awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on November 13 , 2007 , with Klum , Lima , Ambrosio , Kurkova , Goulart , Ebanks , Marisa Miller , and Miranda Kerr at hand .
Alongside new Angel Doutzen Kroes , they also took part in the grand reopening of the Fontainebleau in Miami in 2008 .
In 2009 , it was widely reported that Candice Swanepoel , Rosie Huntington - Whiteley , Chanel Iman , Emanuela de Paula and Lindsay Ellingson had been hired by the brand .
However , De Paula was absent from the fashion show and Erin Heatherton was credited in her place , alongside the Angels ( Klum , Ambrosio , Kerr , Miller , Kroes , and Behati Prinsloo , with Lima being on maternity leave ) .
The brand also held a nationwide competition to hire a new " runway Angel " ( as are dubbed all the models who walk in the show ) , Kylie Bisutti was crowned as the winner but soon parted ways with the brand .
In the following year - and - a - half Swanepoel , Huntington - Whiteley , Iman , Heatherton , and Ellingson all were revealed as Angels .
Various tours have been held featuring the Angels , such as the Bombshell Tour in 2010 ( featuring Laura Croggon , Sophia Timpano , Katie Bryan , and new recruit Lily Aldridge ) , a VSX tour in 2013 ( featuring Swanepoel , Ambrosio , Ellingson , and Aldridge ) and a Swim Tour in 2013 ( featuring Swanepoel , Ellingson , and Heatherton ) .
The Angels have been heavily featured on the brand 's social media , including on a short - lived Facebook application in 2013 - 2014 highlighting the Angels ( then including Lima , Swanepoel , Ellingson , Aldridge , and Karlie Kloss ) as well as Lais Ribeiro , Toni Garrn , and Barbara Palvin .
Ellingson , Kroes , and Kloss all departed soon after the 2014 fashion show , leaving the brand with only 5 Angels .
In 2015 , the Angels as well as models Elsa Hosk , Joan Smalls , Lais Ribeiro , Martha Hunt , Jasmine Tookes , Stella Maxwell , and Monika ' Jac ' Jagaciak were featured on the brand 's first ever Swim Special .
Soon after , in the brand 's biggest group hiring ever , all but Smalls were revealed as Angels , along with longtime catalog regulars Lais Ribeiro and Sara Sampaio as well as Kate Grigorieva , Taylor Hill , and Romee Strijd .
The following year , Jagaciak and Griegorieva exited , while catalog regular Josephine Skriver was added to the roster .
In 2017 , Alessandra Ambrosio announced that the yearly fashion show would be her last .
In 2018 , Chinese Models Sui He and Ming Xi received a contract , meaning they will be Victoria 's Secret Angels but only exclusive to China .
After nearly 20 years of serving as a Victoria 's Secret angel , Adriana Lima made her final walk down the runway during the 2018 's Victoria 's Secret Fashion Show .
Other notable spokesmodels for the brand have included : Claudia Schiffer , Eva Herzigová , Oluchi Onweagba , Jessica Stam , Ana Beatriz Barros , and Bregje Heinen as well as a handful of celebrities such as Taylor Momsen . !

INFLUENCE
ON SOCIOCULTURAL BODY IMAGE NORMS Section::::Criticism and controversy .
Section::::Influence on sociocultural body image norms .
In the 2008 article " Victoria 's Dirty Secret : How Sociocultural Norms Influence Adolescent Girls and Women " written by Strahan , Lafrance , Wilson , and Ethier from Wilfrid Laurier University along with Spencer and Zanna from the University of Waterloo have stated : " Women 's body dissatisfaction is influenced by sociocultural norms for ideal appearance that are pervasive in society and particularly directed at women .
"
These norms tell women that they are valued for their bodies , physical appearance , and scale of attractiveness .
Girls as young as 10 years old start dieting because they are struggling with their weight and body perception .
This will continue throughout their life span .
Victoria 's Secret sends a message to these adolescent girls and women that their models are the standard of beauty .
The models are shown on TV commercials , ads , and magazines meaning it is seen on an everyday basis .
Girls are comparing themselves with these high unrealistic standards that is captivated by the media .
Women in these ads are highly objectified , idealized , and sexualized .
If women feel they have to live up to this sociocultural norm standard , it is only telling men that it is okay to objectify and sexualize women .
The article concludes by stating : " Exposure to societal messages that reflect the sociocultural norm for ideal appearance has a negative effect on women . "
FORMALDEHYDE LAWSUITS Section::::Formaldehyde lawsuits .
In 2009 , Victoria 's Secret was sued several times .
The lawsuits alleged that defective underwear contained formaldehyde that caused severe rashes on women who wore them .
Six cases were filed in Ohio and two in Florida .
At least 17 other suits were filed in six other states after January 2008 .
The plaintiff refused to submit to a simple patch test to determine the precise cause of her reaction and her case was later withdrawn .
The Formaldehyde Council issued a statement that formaldehyde quickly dissipates in air , water and sunlight .
CHILD LABOR
Section::::Child labor .
In 2012 , a Victoria 's Secret supplier was investigated for use of child labor in harvesting cotton used to make its products .
ZEPHYRS LAWSUIT
Section::::Zephyrs lawsuit .
Also in 2012 , Victoria 's Secret was sued by Zephyrs , " accused of breaching a 2001 agreement and selling cheap ' knockoffs ' of the company 's stockings . "
GO EAST LINGERIE COLLECTION Section::::Go
East lingerie collection .
The company drew criticism for a newly released lingerie collection titled " Go East " whose tagline pledged to women the capacity to " indulge in touches of eastern delight with lingerie inspired by the exquisite beauty of secret Japanese gardens .
" The collection included a mesh teddy " Sexy Little Geisha " featuring " flirty cutouts and Eastern - inspired florals " .
The Wall Street Journal reported that the collection was " accessorized with a miniature fan and a kimono - esque obi sash . "
Victoria 's Secret removed the Asian - themed collection " that traded in sexualized , generic pan - Asian ethnic stereotypes . "
PERFECT BODY CAMPAIGN Section::::Perfect Body campaign .
In 2014 , a petition against the newly released lingerie collection called " Body " was created when the poster ads displayed the words ' THE PERFECT " BODY " ' over well - known VS Angels .
The petition , while becoming popular across social media , demanded that Victoria 's Secret " apologise and take responsibility for the unhealthy and damaging message that their ' Perfect Body ' campaign sends out about women 's bodies and how they should be judged . "
The petition also demanded a change in the wording on Victoria 's Secret advertisements for their bra range Body , to something that does not promote unhealthy and unrealistic standards of beauty , " asking the company to not use such harmful marketing in the future .
Petitioners created the hashtag " # iamperfect " , which trended on Twitter for body shaming women .
The petition had over 30,000 signatures .
Although there was never a formal apology released , Victoria 's Secret took note of the petition and changed the words on their ad campaign to ' A BODY FOR EVERY BODY . '
CULTURAL APPROPRIATION
Section::::Cultural appropriation .
At the 2016 Victoria 's Secret Fashion Show , the brand was accused of " cultural appropriation " during the segment " The Road Ahead " that drew inspiration from Chinese culture .
Kendall Jenner 's flame tail , Elsa Hosk 's dragon costume , and Adriana Lima 's embroidered thigh - high boots is what caused an uproar because many fans thought that it was inappropriate for women of other cultures to wear those items that meant so much to the Chinese culture .
The reason behind Victoria 's Secret including this segment to the 2016 fashion show is because of their recent expansion into the Chinese market .
They thought it would be a good way to appeal to the new Chinese customer .
No apology or statement was released from the brand .
ANTI - TRANSGENDER COMMENTS Section::::Anti - transgender comments .
In a November 2018 , Victoria 's Secret president Edward Razek and executive Vice President Of public relations Monica Mitro were interviewed by Vogue .
In the interview , when discussing diversity , Razek made the following comments regarding the Victoria 's Secret Fashion Show : " Should n't you have transsexuals in the show ?
No .
No , I do n't think we should .
Well , why not ?
Because the show is a fantasy .
It 's a 42-minute entertainment special .
That 's what it is . "
These comments received immediate backlash from many in the modeling community , including transgender model Carmen Carrera , former Victoria 's Secret Angels Lily Aldridge and Karlie Kloss , and celebrity model Kendall Jenner .
Razek later issued an apology , stating " My remark regarding the inclusion of transgender models in the Victoria 's Secret Fashion Show came across as insensitive .
I apologize .
To be clear , we would absolutely cast a transgender model for the show . "
