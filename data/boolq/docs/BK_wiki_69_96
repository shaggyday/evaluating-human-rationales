RACK OF LAMB
A rack of lamb or carr√© d'agneau ( though this may also refer to other cuts ) is a cut of lamb cut perpendicularly to the spine , and including 16 ribs or chops .
At retail , it is usually sold ' single ' ( sawn longitudinally and including the 8 ribs on one side only ) , but may also be sold as a " double rack of lamb " , with the ribs on both sides .
Alternatively , two French trimmed racks may be placed together with the ribs interlinked ; when configured this way it is often known as a ' Guard of honour ' .
Rack of lamb is usually roasted , sometimes first coated with a herbed breadcrumb persillade .
The tips of the bones are sometimes decorated with paper frills called manchettes .
CROWN ROAST Section::::Crown roast .
Two or three single racks of lamb tied into a circle make a " crown roast of lamb " .
Crown roasts are sometimes cooked with ( ground - lamb ) stuffing in the middle .
FRENCHING
Section::::Frenching .
Rack of lamb is often French trimmed ( also known as Frenching in the United States ) , that is , the rib bones are exposed by cutting off the fat and meat covering them .
Typically , three inches ( 7 - 8 cm ) of bone beyond the main muscle ( the rib eye or Longissimus dorsi ) are left on the rack , with the top two inches ( 5 cm ) exposed .
