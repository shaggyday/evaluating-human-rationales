OVERSEAS SERVICE BAR
An Overseas Service Bar is an accoutrement on a United States Army , Army Service Uniform and previously on the Army Green ( Class A ) and the Army Blue ( Dress Blue ) uniforms that indicates a soldier has served six months of service in a combat zone .
Overseas Service Bars are displayed as an embroidered gold bar worn horizontally on the right sleeve of the Class A uniform and the Army Service Uniform .
Overseas Service Bars are cumulative , in that each bar worn indicates another six - month period .
Time spent overseas is also cumulative , meaning one bar could be earned for two separate deployments totaling six months .
The Overseas Service Bars shown here as ' Korea ' were used as Overseas Service Bars in World War II .
BACKGROUND Section::::Background .
The original concept of an Overseas Bar began in the First World War with what was known as an Overseas Chevron .
An Overseas Chevron was an inverted chevron patch of gold metallic thread on olive drab backing worn on the lower left sleeve on the standard Army dress uniform over the Service Stripes .
The chevron was identical to the Wound Chevron which was worn on the opposite right sleeve .
* Silver Chevron Stateside War Service for 6 months .
* Gold Chevron Overseas War Service for 6 months .
*
Powder Blue Chevron Overseas War Service for less than 6 months .
Soldiers ' Overseas Service was calculated from the day they disembarked in Britain or France .
Sailors and Marines who served in the European war zone aboard a ship for 6 months ( Shipboard Service ) wore their chevron point upwards .
If they served ashore , they qualified for the Overseas War Service chevron .
During World War II , the chevron was redesignated as the Overseas Bar and the patch adopted its current design of a horizontal bar .
( During WWII , it was often informally referred to as a " Hershey bar . " )
For those who had performed overseas service in both the First and Second World Wars , the Overseas Bar and Chevron were worn simultaneously .
In 1953 , the Overseas Service Bar had adopted its current name and the patch was now worn on the lower right sleeve , instead of the left .
The Overseas Service Bar is a separate award from the Overseas Service Ribbon , which recognizes overseas service in any location without regard to whether or not the area has been designated a combat zone .
Regulations permit receiving both awards for the same qualifying period of service .

NOTABLE OFFICERS
* General of the Army Douglas MacArthur was awarded a total of 14 overseas service bars - 3 for World War I , 9 for World War II and 2 for the Korean War .
( Strictly speaking , General MacArthur received one silver chevron for 6 months of stateside service and three gold chevrons for 18 months of overseas service during World War I.
As the overseas chevrons are equivalent to overseas service bars , they are counted toward the total above . )
He was one of a very few United States service members who was not a prisoner of war to spend the entirety of World War II overseas .
* General William Westmoreland was awarded a total of 16 overseas service bars - 6 for World War II , 2 for Korea and 8 for Vietnam .
* General David Petraeus and General Raymond T. Odierno have each been awarded 11 overseas service bars .
* Colonel Floyd James Thompson , a Green Beret , served a total of 9 years and 3 months in Vietnam with all but 3 months served as a prisoner of war .
He was a awarded a total of 18 overseas service bars .
This is probably the highest number of overseas service bars awarded to an individual .
