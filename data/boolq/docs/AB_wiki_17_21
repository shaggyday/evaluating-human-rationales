DETROIT LIONS
The Detroit Lions are a professional American football team based in Detroit , Michigan .
The Lions compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) as a member club of the league 's National Football Conference ( NFC ) North division .
The team plays its home games at Ford Field in Downtown Detroit .
Originally based in Portsmouth , Ohio and called the Portsmouth Spartans , the team formally joined the NFL on July 12 , 1930 and began play in the 1930 season .
Despite success within the NFL , they could not survive in Portsmouth , then the NFL 's smallest city .
The team was purchased and relocated to Detroit for the 1934 season .
The Lions have won four NFL championships , tied for 9th overall in total championships amongst all 32 NFL franchises ; however , their last was in 1957 , which gives the club the second - longest NFL championship drought behind the Arizona Cardinals .
They are one of four current teams and the only NFC team to have not yet played in the Super Bowl .
They are also the only franchise to have been in operation for all 52 seasons of the Super Bowl era without having appeared in one ( the Cleveland Browns were not in operation for the 1996 to 1998 seasons ) .
FRANCHISE HISTORY
LOGOS AND UNIFORMS Section::::Logos and uniforms .
Aside from a brief change to maroon in 1948 instituted by then head coach Bo McMillin ( influenced by his years as coach at Indiana ) , the Lions uniforms have basically remained the same since the team debuted in 1930 .
The design consists of silver helmets , silver pants , and either blue or white jerseys .
The shade of blue used for Lions uniforms and logos is officially known as " Honolulu blue " , which is supposedly inspired by the color of the waves off the coast of Hawaii .
The shade was chosen by Cy Huston in 1935 .
Houston , the Lions ' first vice president and general manager , said of the choice : " They had me looking at so many blues I am blue in the face " , Houston said about the selection . "
But anyway , it 's the kind of blue , I am told , that will match with silver . "
There have been minor changes to the uniform design throughout the years , such as changing the silver stripe patterns on the jersey sleeves , and changing the colors of the jersey numbers .
" TV numbers " , which are auxiliary uniform numbers to help TV broadcasters identify players from the line of scrimmage , were added to the jersey sleeves in 1956 .
White trim was added to the logo in 1970 .
In 1998 , the team wore blue pants with their white jerseys along with grey socks but dropped that combination after the season .
In 1999 , the " TV numbers " on the sleeves were moved to the shoulders .
In 1994 , every NFL team wore throwback jerseys , and the Lions ' were similar to the jerseys used during their 1935 championship season .
The helmets and pants were solid silver , the jerseys Honolulu blue with silver numbers and the jersey did not have " TV numbers " on the sleeves .
The team wore solid blue socks along with black shoes .
The helmets also did not have a logo , as helmets were simple leather back then .
The Lions also wore ' 50s - style jerseys during their traditional Thanksgiving Day games from 2001 to 2004 as the NFL encouraged teams to wear throwback jerseys on Thanksgiving Day .
In 2003 , the team added black trim to their logo and the jerseys .
The face masks on the helmet changed from blue to black with the introduction of the new color .
Additionally , an alternate home field jersey which makes black the dominant color ( in place of Honolulu Blue ) was introduced in 2005 .
For 2008 , the team dropped the black alternate jerseys in favor of a throwback uniform to commemorate the franchise 's 75th anniversary .
The throwback uniform became the team 's permanent alternate jersey in 2009 , replacing the former black alternate .
The Lions officially unveiled new logo designs and uniforms on April 20 , 2009 .
The lion on the helmet now has a flowing mane and fangs , and the typeface of " Lions " is more modern .
On February 1 , 2017 , the Lions announced a new typeface , logo , and the complete removal of the color black from the team identity .
The team " made it a priority to emphasize our classic color combination of Honolulu blue and silver , which has been synonymous with the Detroit Lions since 1934 .
" The new logo is identical to the old , except with a silver border instead of a black one .
The Lions then unveiled the club 's new uniforms on April 13 , 2017 .
The Lions also added the initials " WCF " to the left sleeve as a permanent tribute to William Clay Ford , who owned the team from 1963 until his death in 2014 .
The sleeve addition replaces the black " WCF " patch on the left breast that was added after Ford 's death .

Section::::Radio .
The Lions ' flagship radio station is WJR 760 AM .
Dan Miller does play - by - play , Jim Brandstatter does color commentary , and Tony Ortiz provides sideline reports .
The team moved to WJR for the 2016 NFL season , ending a 20-year relationship with CBS Radio - owned WXYT - FM .
The decision to part with WXYT was reportedly instigated by a demand by the team for the station to fire on - air personality Mike Valenti — who has had a history of making comments critical of the Lions during his drive - time show — as a condition of any future renewal .
A CBS Radio spokesperson stated that their refusal was meant to maintain the station 's integrity .
TV PRESEASON Section::::TV . Section::::Preseason .
In 2015 , WJBK took over from WXYZ - TV as the flagship station for Lions preseason games .
The announcers are Matt Shepard with play - by - play , Rob Rubick and Nate Burleson with color commentary , and FOX2 's Jennifer Hammond with sideline reports .
Wraparound shows and preseason games are produced by Fox Sports Detroit which also airs replays of the broadcasts .
REGULAR SEASON Section::::Regular season .
Regular season games are broadcast regionally on Fox , except when the Lions play an AFC team in Detroit , in which case the game airs regionally on CBS .
The Thanksgiving Day game in Detroit is always televised nationally on either Fox ( odd - numbered years ) or CBS(even - numbered years ) .
The Detroit Lions were the last NFC team to play on NBC 's Sunday Night Football since the network got the rights to air NFL games back in 2006 ( the Lions at Saints game on December 4 , 2011 marked their 1st appearance ) .
The Lions ' official regular season pregame show is The Ford Lions Report .
BLACKOUTS Section::::Blackouts .
The Lions ' winless performance in 2008 and 2–14 season in 2009 , coupled with the effects of the Great Recession in Michigan , led to several local broadcast blackouts , as local fans did not purchase enough tickets by the 72-hour blackout deadline .
In 2008 , five of the Lions ' final six home games of the season did not sell out , with the Thanksgiving game being the exception .
The first blackout in the seven - year history of Ford Field was on October 26 , 2008 , against the Washington Redskins .
The previous 50 regular season home games had been sellouts .
The second home game of the 2009 season in which the Lions broke the losing streak ( also against the Washington Redskins ) was blacked out locally , as well as the comeback victory over the Cleveland Browns .
The Lions had only one blackout in 2010 , yet another Washington Redskins game , which the Lions won 37–25 .
However , since 2015 , the NFL suspended its blackout policies , meaning that all Lions games will be shown on local TV , regardless of tickets sold .
Games were also often blacked out at the Lions ' previous home , the 80,000-seat Pontiac Silverdome , despite winning seasons and the success and popularity of star players such as Barry Sanders .
