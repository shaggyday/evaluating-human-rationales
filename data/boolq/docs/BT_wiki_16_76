PLOT Section::::Plot .
Turmoil erupts in Nigeria following a military coup d'etat , which involves the brutal murders of the president and his family .
As foreign nationals are evacuated from the country , Lieutenant A.K. Waters ( Bruce Willis ) and his U.S. Navy SEAL detachment comprising Zee ( Eamonn Walker ) , Slo ( Nick Chinlund ) , Red ( Cole Hauser ) , Lake ( Johnny Messner ) , Silk ( Charles Ingram ) , Doc ( Paul Francis ) , and Flea ( Chad Smith ) , aboard the aircraft carrier , are dispatched by Captain Bill Rhodes ( Tom Skerritt ) to extract a " critical persona , " one Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks ( Monica Bellucci ) , a U.S. citizen by marriage and daughter - in - law of a U.S. Senator .
Their secondary mission is to extract the mission priest ( Pierrino Mascarino ) and two nuns ( Fionnula Flanagan and Cornelia Hayes O'Herlihy ) , should they choose to come .
The mission begins as planned .
Waters tells Dr. Kendricks of the company of rebel soldiers closing in on her hospital and the mission , and that the team 's orders are to extract U.S. personnel ; however , Kendricks refuses to leave without the patients .
Waters calls Captain Rhodes for options ; after their short and ambiguous conversation , he concedes to Dr. Kendricks that they will take those refugees able to walk .
She begins assembling the able - bodied for the hike ; the priest and the nuns stay behind to take care of the injured .
Irritated and behind the schedule , the team and the refugees leave their hospital mission after daybreak .
At nightfall they take a short break .
Guerrilla rebels rapidly approach their position , and Waters stealthily kills a straggling rebel .
Dr. Kendricks warns Waters that the rebels are going to the mission , but he is determined to carry out his orders , and they continue to the extraction point .
Back at the mission , the staff and refugees are confronted by rebel forces .
Despite the priest 's pleas for mercy , the rebel forces execute him and the remaining occupants .
When the team arrives at the extraction point , Waters ' initial plan becomes clear : the SEALs suddenly turn away the refugees from the waiting helicopter .
Waters forces Dr. Kendricks into the helicopter , leaving the refugees stranded in the jungle , unprotected against the rebels .
En route to the aircraft carrier , they fly over the original mission compound , seeing it destroyed and all its occupants murdered , as Dr. Kendricks had predicted .
Remorseful , Waters orders the pilot to return to the refugees .
He then loads as many refugees as he can into the helicopter and decides to escort the remaining refugees to the Cameroon border .
During the hike to the border , using satellite scans , they discover the rebels are somehow tracking them .
As they escape and evade the rebels , the team enters a village whose inhabitants are being raped , tortured , and massacred by rebel soldiers .
Aware of having the opportunity to stop it , Waters orders the team to take down the rebels .
The team is visibly shaken by the atrocities they see the rebels have committed against the villagers .
Again en route , Slo determines that a refugee is transmitting a signal allowing the rebels to locate them .
The search for the transmitter reveals the presence of Arthur Azuka ( Sammi Rotibi ) , the surviving son of late President Samuel Azuka , which they realize is the reason the rebels are hunting them : Samuel Azuka was not only the president of the country , but also the tribal king of the Igbo .
As the only surviving member of this royal bloodline , Arthur is the only person left with a legitimate claim to the leadership of Nigeria .
Waters is angry at Dr. Kendricks , who knew of Arthur 's identity , yet never informed the SEAL team .
A newer refugee ( Jimmy Jean - Louis ) picked up during the trek is discovered with the transmitter on his person .
He attempts to run but is shot .
The team decides to continue escorting the refugees to Cameroon , regardless of the cost .
A firefight ensues when the rebels finally catch up with the SEALs , who decide to stay behind as rearguard to buy the refugees enough time to reach the border safely .
Zee radios the Truman for air support ; two F / A-18A Hornets take off and head for the firefight .
The rebels kill Slo , Lake , Flea and Silk .
Waters , Red , Doc and Zee are wounded but direct the fighter pilots on where to attack .
Arthur and Dr. Kendricks are scrambling to the Cameroon border gate when they hear the fighter jets approach and bomb the entire rebel force .
Waters , Zee , Doc , and Red rise from the grass as U.S. Navy helicopters land in Cameroon , opposite the Nigerian border fence gate .
Captain Rhodes arrives and orders the gate open , letting in the SEALs and the refugees .
A detail of U.S. Marines then escorts the SEALs to the helicopters .
Captain Rhodes promises Waters that he will recover the bodies of his men .
Dr. Kendricks says her tearful farewells to Nigerian friends and flies away in a helicopter while romantically embracing Waters , watching as Arthur is surrounded by his people proclaiming their freedom .
