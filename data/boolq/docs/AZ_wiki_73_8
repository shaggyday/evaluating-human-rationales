HALF DOLLAR ( UNITED STATES COIN )
The half dollar , sometimes referred to as the half for short , is a United States coin worth 50 cents , one - half of a dollar , and is the largest United States circulating coin currently produced in both size and weight , being 1.205 inches ( 30.61 mm ) in diameter and .085 inches ( 2.15 mm ) in thickness , and is twice the weight of the quarter .
The current half dollar , the Kennedy half dollar , depicts the profile of President John F. Kennedy on the obverse and the Seal of the President of the United States on the reverse , but the design has undergone a number of changes throughout its history .
Though not commonly used today , half dollar coins have a long history of heavy use alongside other denominations of coinage , but have faded out of general circulation for many reasons .
They were produced in fairly large quantities until the year 2002 , when the U.S. Mint ceased production of the coin for general circulation .
As a result of its decreasing usage , a large amount of pre-2002 half dollars remain in Federal Reserve vaults , prompting the change in production .
Presently , collector half dollars can be ordered directly from the U.S. Mint , and pre-2002 circulation half dollars may be ordered through most U.S. banks .
CIRCULATION Section::::Circulation .
Half dollar coins saw heavy use , particularly in the first half of the 20th century .
For many years , they were ( and in many areas still are ) commonly used by gamblers at casinos and other venues with slot machines .
Rolls of half dollars may still be kept on hand in cardrooms for games requiring 50-cent antes or bring - in bets , for dealers to pay winning naturals in blackjack , or where the house collects a rake in increments .
Additionally , some concession vendors at sporting events distribute half dollar coins as change for convenience .
By the early 1960s , the rising price of silver neared the point where the bullion value of U.S. silver coins would exceed face value .
In 1965 , the U.S. introduced layered composition coins made of a copper core laminated between two cupronickel outer faces .
The silver content of dimes and quarters was eliminated , but the Kennedy half dollar composition contained silver ( reduced from 90 % to 40 % ) from 1965 to 1970 .
Even with its reduced silver content , the half dollar attracted widespread interest from speculators and collectors , and that interest led to widespread hoarding of half dollars dated 1970 and earlier .
By the time that the coin 's composition was changed to match that of the clad dimes and quarters in 1971 , businesses and the public began losing interest in the half dollar and the coin began to gradually disappear from circulation during the 1970s .
Merchants stopped ordering half dollars from their banks , and many banks stopped ordering half dollars from the Federal Reserve , and the U.S. mints sharply reduced production of the coins .
Since 2002 , half dollars have been minted only for collectors , due to large Federal Reserve and government inventories on hand of pre-2001 pieces ; this is mostly due to lack of demand and large quantity returns from casino slot machines that now operate " coinless " .
Eventually , when the reserve supply runs low , the mint will again fill orders for circulation half dollars .
It took about 18 years ( 1981–1999 ) for the large inventory stockpile of a similar low - demand circulation coin , the $ 1 coin , to reach reserve levels low enough to again produce circulation pieces .
Modern - date half dollars can be purchased in proof sets , mint sets , rolls , and bags from the U.S. Mint , and existing inventory circulation pieces can be ordered through most U.S. banks .
All collector issues since 2001 have had much lower mintages than in previous years .
Although intended only for collectors , these post-2001 half dollars sometimes find their way into circulation .
ASPECTS OF EARLY HISTORY Section::::Aspects of early history .
On December 1 , 1794 , the first half dollars , approximately 5,300 pieces , were delivered .
Another 18,000 were produced in January 1795 using dies of 1794 , to save the expense of making new ones .
Another 30,000 pieces were struck by the end of 1801 .
The coin had the Heraldic Eagle , based on the Great Seal of the United States on the reverse .
150,000 were minted in 1804 but struck with dies from 1803 , so no 1804 specimens exist , though there were some pieces dated 1805 that carried a " 5 over 4 " overdate .
In 1838 , half dollar dies were produced in the Philadelphia Mint for the newly established New Orleans Mint , and ten test samples of the 1838 half dollars were made at the main Philadelphia mint .
These samples were put into the mint safe along with other rarities like the 1804 silver dollar .
The dies were then shipped to New Orleans for the regular production of 1838 half dollars .
However , New Orleans production of the half dollars was delayed due to the priority of producing half dimes and dimes .
The large press for half dollar production was not used in New Orleans until January 1839 to produce 1838 half dollars , but the reverse die could not be properly secured , and only ten samples were produced before the dies failed .
Rufus Tyler , chief coiner of the New Orleans mint , wrote to Mint Director Patterson of the problem on February 25 , 1839 .
The Orleans mint samples all had a double stamped reverse as a result of this production problem and they also showed dramatic signs of die rust , neither of which are present on the Philadelphia produced test samples .
While eight Philadelphia minted samples survive to this day , there is only one known New Orleans minted specimen with the tell - tale double stamped reverse and die rust .
This is the famous coin that Rufus Tyler presented to Alexander Dallas Bache ( great grandson of Benjamin Franklin ) in the summer of 1839 and was later purchased in June 1894 by A. G. Heaton , the father of mint mark coin collecting .
The 1838 Philadelphia - produced half dollars are extremely rare , with two separate specimens having sold for $ 632,500 in Heritage auctions in 2005 and 2008 respectively .
The sole surviving Orleans minted 1838 is one of the rarest of all American coins .
In 1840 this mint produced nearly 180,000 half dollars .
In 1861 , the New Orleans mint produced coins for three different governments .
A total of 330,000 were struck under the United States government , 1,240,000 for the State of Louisiana after it seceded from the Union , and 962,633 after it joined the Confederacy .
Since the same die was used for all strikings , the output looks identical .
However the Confederate States of America actually minted four half dollars with a CSA ( rather than USA ) reverse and the obverse die they used had a small die crack .
Thus " regular " 1861 half dollars with this crack probably were used by the Confederates for some of the mass striking .
There are two varieties of Kennedy half dollars in the proof set issues of 1964 .
Initially , the die was used with accented hair , showing deeper lines than the president 's widow , Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis , liked .
New dies were prepared to smooth out some of the details .
It is estimated that about 1 to 3 % ( 40,000 to 100,000 ) of the proof halves are of the earlier type , making them somewhat more expensive for collectors .
