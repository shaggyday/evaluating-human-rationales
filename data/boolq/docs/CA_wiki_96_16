STRIP STEAK
The strip steak is a cut of beef steaks from the short loin from a cow .
It consists of a muscle that does little work , the longissimus , making the meat particularly tender , although not as tender as the nearby psoas major or tenderloin .
Unlike the tenderloin , the longissimus is a sizable muscle , allowing it to be cut into larger portions .
