RANDOM GLUCOSE
TEST
Random glucose test ( random blood glucose ) is a blood sugar test taken from a non - fasting subject .
This test , also called capillary blood glucose ( CBG ) , assumes a recent meal and therefore has higher reference values than the fasting glucose test .
REFERENCE VALUES Section::::Reference values .
The reference values for a " normal " random glucose test in an average adult are 79–160
mg / dl ( 4.4–8.9 mmol / l ) , between 160–200 mg / dl ( 8.9–11.1 mmol / l ) is considered pre - diabetes , and > 200 mg / dl is considered diabetes according to ADA guidelines ( you should visit your doctor or a clinic for additional tests however as a random glucose of > 200 mg / dl does not necessarily mean you are diabetic ) .
