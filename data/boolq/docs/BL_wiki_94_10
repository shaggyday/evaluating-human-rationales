LIST OF NC-17 RATED FILMS
This is a list of films rated NC-17
( No One
17 or Under Admitted ; originally No Children Under 17 Admitted ) by the Motion Picture Association of America 's Classification and Rating Administration ( CARA ) .
It includes X - rated films reassigned an NC-17 rating , and titles which were originally rated NC-17 , but later re - edited for a different rating .
Titles with surrendered ratings are usually released unrated to avoid the stigma of NC-17 .
Some films are released without an MPAA rating because the filmmaker expects an NC-17 . Changes in ratings are due to resubmission or appeal by a film 's producers .
Films receiving an NC-17 are often cut and resubmitted in hopes of earning an R rating , which allows distribution to more outlets than an NC-17 rating .
Still , there are some exceptions : for example , in 2004 , Fox Searchlight Pictures released The Dreamers with an NC-17 rating ; this film grossed $ 2.5 million in its United States theatrical release , a respectable result for a specialized film with a targeted audience .
The same year , Sony Pictures Classics released Bad Education with an NC-17 rating ; it grossed $ 5.2 million in the United States theatrically , earning back more than its budget of $ 5 million .
Furthermore , in 2007 , Focus Features released Lust , Caution with an NC-17 rating ; it grossed $ 4.6 million in the United States theatrically , and Focus was very satisfied with the film 's theatrical release .
NC-17
films also tended to gross more on the home media market .
For example , Showgirls became one of MGM 's top 20 all - time bestsellers , and Lust , Caution has generated more than $ 18 million from DVD rentals in the United States .
Occasionally an R - rated film will have footage or language added to earn an NC-17 rating and its accompanying notoriety .
In at least one case , an R - rated film was re - rated NC-17 even though no edits were made : The 1969 Sam Peckinpah film The Wild Bunch , originally rated R , was resubmitted by Warner Bros. in 1993 before an expected re - release ; to their surprise , it was rated NC-17 , delaying the re - release while the decision was appealed .
Some titles include the reasons the rating was given .
In 1990 , the Classification and Rating Administration began including a brief statement of the reason for a specific film 's R rating ; several years later it began giving reasons for all film ratings .
Since the NC-17 rating was created in 1990 to replace the X rating ( The Cook , the Thief , His Wife & Her Lover , Tie Me Up !
Tie Me Down !
, Life Is Cheap ...
But Toilet Paper Is Expensive , and Texas Chainsaw Massacre III were all given X ratings that year ) , this list does not include X - rated films , unless they were later re - rated NC-17 .
A majority of the films on this list either were edited to obtain an R and/or had the NC-17 rating surrendered .
Few films have kept the rating for theatrical or DVD release .
