As the preeminent Athenian historian , Thucydides , wrote in his influential History of the Peloponnesian War , \" The growth of the power of Athens , and the alarm which this inspired in Lacedaemon , made war inevitable . \" Indeed , the nearly fifty years of Greek history that preceded the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War had been marked by the development of Athens as a major power in the Mediterranean world . Its empire began as a small group of city - states , called the Delian League \u2014 from the island of Delos , on which they kept their treasury \u2014 that came together to ensure that the Greco - Persian Wars were truly over . After defeating the Second Persian invasion of Greece in the year 480 BC , Athens led the coalition of Greek city - states that continued the Greco - Persian Wars with attacks on Persian territories in the Aegean and Ionia . What then ensued was a period , referred to as the Pentecontaetia ( the name given by Thucydides ) , in which Athens increasingly became in fact an empire , carrying out an aggressive war against Persia and increasingly dominating other city - states . Athens proceeded to bring under its control all of Greece except for Sparta and its allies , ushering in a period which is known to history as the Athenian Empire . By the middle of the century , the Persians had been driven from the Aegean and forced to cede control of a vast range of territories to Athens . At the same time , Athens greatly increased its own power ; a number of its formerly independent allies were reduced , over the course of the century , to the status of tribute - paying subject states of the Delian League .
