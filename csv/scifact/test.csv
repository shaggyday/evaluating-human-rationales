0,"Genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) have now identified at least 2,000 common variants that appear associated with common diseases or related traits ( http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies ) , hundreds of which have been convincingly replicated . It is generally thought that the associated markers reflect the effect of a nearby common ( minor allele frequency > 0.05 ) causal site , which is associated with the marker , leading to extensive resequencing efforts to find causal sites . We propose as an alternative explanation that variants much less common than the associated one may create "" synthetic associations "" by occurring , stochastically , more often in association with one of the alleles at the common site versus the other allele . Although synthetic associations are an obvious theoretical possibility , they have never been systematically explored as a possible explanation for GWAS findings . Here , we use simple computer simulations to show the conditions under which such synthetic associations will arise and how they may be recognized . We show that they are not only possible , but inevitable , and that under simple but reasonable genetic models , they are likely to account for or contribute to many of the recently identified signals reported in genome-wide association studies . We also illustrate the behavior of synthetic associations in real datasets by showing that rare causal mutations responsible for both hearing loss and sickle cell anemia create genome-wide significant synthetic associations , in the latter case extending over a 2.5-Mb interval encompassing scores of "" blocks "" of associated variants . In conclusion , uncommon or rare genetic variants can easily create synthetic associations that are credited to common variants , and this possibility requires careful consideration in the interpretation and follow up of GWAS signals .

1,"OBJECTIVES To carry out a further survey of archived appendix samples to understand better the differences between existing estimates of the prevalence of subclinical infection with prions after the bovine spongiform encephalopathy epizootic and to see whether a broader birth cohort was affected , and to understand better the implications for the management of blood and blood products and for the handling of surgical instruments . DESIGN Irreversibly unlinked and anonymised large scale survey of archived appendix samples . SETTING Archived appendix samples from the pathology departments of 41 UK hospitals participating in the earlier survey , and additional hospitals in regions with lower levels of participation in that survey . SAMPLE 32,441 archived appendix samples fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin and tested for the presence of abnormal prion protein ( PrP ) . RESULTS Of the 32,441 appendix samples 16 were positive for abnormal PrP , indicating an overall prevalence of 493 per million population ( 95 % confidence interval 282 to 801 per million ) . The prevalence in those born in 1941 - 60 ( 733 per million , 269 to 1596 per million ) did not differ significantly from those born between 1961 and 1985 ( 412 per million , 198 to 758 per million ) and was similar in both sexes and across the three broad geographical areas sampled . Genetic testing of the positive specimens for the genotype at PRNP codon 129 revealed a high proportion that were valine homozygous compared with the frequency in the normal population , and in stark contrast with confirmed clinical cases of vCJD , all of which were methionine homozygous at PRNP codon 129 . CONCLUSIONS This study corroborates previous studies and suggests a high prevalence of infection with abnormal PrP , indicating vCJD carrier status in the population compared with the 177 vCJD cases to date .

2,"BACKGROUND The heritable haemoglobinopathy alpha(+)-thalassaemia is caused by the reduced synthesis of alpha-globin chains that form part of normal adult haemoglobin ( Hb ) . Individuals homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia have microcytosis and an increased erythrocyte count . Alpha(+)-thalassaemia homozygosity confers considerable protection against severe malaria , including severe malarial anaemia ( SMA ) ( Hb concentration < 50 g/l ) , but does not influence parasite count . We tested the hypothesis that the erythrocyte indices associated with alpha(+)-thalassaemia homozygosity provide a haematological benefit during acute malaria . METHODS AND FINDINGS Data from children living on the north coast of Papua New Guinea who had participated in a case-control study of the protection afforded by alpha(+)-thalassaemia against severe malaria were reanalysed to assess the genotype-specific reduction in erythrocyte count and Hb levels associated with acute malarial disease . We observed a reduction in median erythrocyte count of approximately 1.5 x 10(12)/l in all children with acute falciparum malaria relative to values in community children ( p < 0.001 ) . We developed a simple mathematical model of the linear relationship between Hb concentration and erythrocyte count . This model predicted that children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia lose less Hb than children of normal genotype for a reduction in erythrocyte count of > 1.1 x 10(12)/l as a result of the reduced mean cell Hb in homozygous alpha(+)-thalassaemia . In addition , children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia require a 10 % greater reduction in erythrocyte count than children of normal genotype ( p = 0.02 ) for Hb concentration to fall to 50 g/l , the cutoff for SMA . We estimated that the haematological profile in children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia reduces the risk of SMA during acute malaria compared to children of normal genotype ( relative risk 0.52 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.24 - 1.12 , p = 0.09 ) . CONCLUSIONS The increased erythrocyte count and microcytosis in children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia may contribute substantially to their protection against SMA . A lower concentration of Hb per erythrocyte and a larger population of erythrocytes may be a biologically advantageous strategy against the significant reduction in erythrocyte count that occurs during acute infection with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum . This haematological profile may reduce the risk of anaemia by other Plasmodium species , as well as other causes of anaemia . Other host polymorphisms that induce an increased erythrocyte count and microcytosis may confer a similar advantage .

11,"Improved sequencing technologies offer unprecedented opportunities for investigating the role of rare genetic variation in common disease . However , there are considerable challenges with respect to study design , data analysis and replication . Using pooled next-generation sequencing of 507 genes implicated in the repair of DNA in 1,150 samples , an analytical strategy focused on protein-truncating variants ( PTVs ) and a large-scale sequencing case – control replication experiment in 13,642 individuals , here we show that rare PTVs in the p53-inducible protein phosphatase PPM1D are associated with predisposition to breast cancer and ovarian cancer . PPM1D PTV mutations were present in 25 out of 7,781 cases versus 1 out of 5,861 controls ( P = 1.12 × 10−5 ) , including 18 mutations in 6,912 individuals with breast cancer ( P = 2.42 × 10−4 ) and 12 mutations in 1,121 individuals with ovarian cancer ( P = 3.10 × 10−9 ) . Notably , all of the identified PPM1D PTVs were mosaic in lymphocyte DNA and clustered within a 370-base-pair region in the final exon of the gene , carboxy-terminal to the phosphatase catalytic domain . Functional studies demonstrate that the mutations result in enhanced suppression of p53 in response to ionizing radiation exposure , suggesting that the mutant alleles encode hyperactive PPM1D isoforms . Thus , although the mutations cause premature protein truncation , they do not result in the simple loss-of-function effect typically associated with this class of variant , but instead probably have a gain-of-function effect . Our results have implications for the detection and management of breast and ovarian cancer risk . More generally , these data provide new insights into the role of rare and of mosaic genetic variants in common conditions , and the use of sequencing in their identification . Gliomas arising in the brainstem and thalamus are devastating tumors that are difficult to surgically resect . To determine the genetic and epigenetic landscape of these tumors , we performed exomic sequencing of 14 brainstem gliomas ( BSGs ) and 12 thalamic gliomas . We also performed targeted mutational analysis of an additional 24 such tumors and genome-wide methylation profiling of 45 gliomas . This study led to the discovery of tumor-specific mutations in PPM1D , encoding wild-type p53-induced protein phosphatase 1D ( WIP1 ) , in 37.5 % of the BSGs that harbored hallmark H3F3A mutations encoding p. Lys27Met substitutions . PPM1D mutations were mutually exclusive with TP53 mutations in BSG and attenuated p53 activation in vitro . PPM1D mutations were truncating alterations in exon 6 that enhanced the ability of PPM1D to suppress the activation of the DNA damage response checkpoint protein CHK2 . These results define PPM1D as a frequent target of somatic mutation and as a potential therapeutic target in brainstem gliomas .

13,"Angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors are now one of the most frequently used classes of antihypertensive drugs . Beyond their utility in the management of hypertension , their use has been extended to the long-term management of patients with congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , as well as diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathies . Although ACE inhibitor therapy usually improves renal blood flow ( RBF ) and sodium excretion rates in CHF and reduces the rate of progressive renal injury in chronic renal disease , its use can also be associated with a syndrome of “ functional renal insufficiency ” and/or hyperkalemia . This form of acute renal failure ( ARF ) most commonly develops shortly after initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy but can be observed after months or years of therapy , even in the absence of prior ill effects . ARF is most likely to occur when renal perfusion pressure can not be sustained because of substantial decreases in mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) or when glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) is highly angiotensin II ( Ang II ) dependent . Conditions that predict an adverse hemodynamic effect of ACE inhibitors in patients with CHF are preexisting hypotension and low cardiac filling pressures . The GFR is especially dependent on Ang II during extracellular fluid ( ECF ) volume depletion , high-grade bilateral renal artery stenosis , or stenosis of a dominant or single kidney , as in a renal transplant recipient .

OBJECTIVE To provide information about the nature and extent of indoor secondary aerosolization of B anthracis spores . DESIGN Stationary and personal air samples , surface dust , and swab samples were collected under semiquiescent ( minimal activities ) and then simulated active office conditions to estimate secondary aerosolization of B anthracis spores . Nominal size characteristics , airborne concentrations , and surface contamination of B anthracis particles ( colony-forming units ) were evaluated . RESULTS Viable B anthracis spores reaerosolized under semiquiescent conditions , with a marked increase in reaerosolization during simulated active office conditions . Increases were observed for B anthracis collected on open sheep blood agar plates ( P<.001 ) and personal air monitors ( P = .01 ) during active office conditions . More than 80 % of the B anthracis particles collected on stationary monitors were within an alveolar respirable size range of 0.95 to 3.5 micro m.

15,"Antibiotics can have significant and long-lasting effects on the gastrointestinal tract microbiota , reducing colonization resistance against pathogens including Clostridium difficile . Here we show that antibiotic treatment induces substantial changes in the gut microbial community and in the metabolome of mice susceptible to C. difficile infection . Levels of secondary bile acids , glucose , free fatty acids and dipeptides decrease , whereas those of primary bile acids and sugar alcohols increase , reflecting the modified metabolic activity of the altered gut microbiome . In vitro and ex vivo analyses demonstrate that C. difficile can exploit specific metabolites that become more abundant in the mouse gut after antibiotics , including the primary bile acid taurocholate for germination , and carbon sources such as mannitol , fructose , sorbitol , raffinose and stachyose for growth .

16,"BACKGROUND Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection is the strongest risk factor for developing tuberculosis and has fuelled its resurgence , especially in sub-Saharan Africa . In 2010 , there were an estimated 1.1 million incident cases of tuberculosis among the 34 million people living with HIV worldwide . Antiretroviral therapy has substantial potential to prevent HIV-associated tuberculosis . We conducted a systematic review of studies that analysed the impact of antiretroviral therapy on the incidence of tuberculosis in adults with HIV infection . METHODS AND FINDINGS PubMed , Embase , African Index Medicus , LILACS , and clinical trial registries were systematically searched . Randomised controlled trials , prospective cohort studies , and retrospective cohort studies were included if they compared tuberculosis incidence by antiretroviral therapy status in HIV-infected adults for a median of over 6 mo in developing countries . For the meta-analyses there were four categories based on CD4 counts at antiretroviral therapy initiation : ( 1 ) less than 200 cells/µl , ( 2 ) 200 to 350 cells/µl , ( 3 ) greater than 350 cells/µl , and ( 4 ) any CD4 count . Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria . Antiretroviral therapy is strongly associated with a reduction in the incidence of tuberculosis in all baseline CD4 count categories : ( 1 ) less than 200 cells/µl ( hazard ratio [ HR ] 0.16 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.07 to 0.36 ) , ( 2 ) 200 to 350 cells/µl ( HR 0.34 , 95 % CI 0.19 to 0.60 ) , ( 3 ) greater than 350 cells/µl ( HR 0.43 , 95 % CI 0.30 to 0.63 ) , and ( 4 ) any CD4 count ( HR 0.35 , 95 % CI 0.28 to 0.44 ) . There was no evidence of hazard ratio modification with respect to baseline CD4 count category ( p = 0.20 ) . CONCLUSIONS Antiretroviral therapy is strongly associated with a reduction in the incidence of tuberculosis across all CD4 count strata . Earlier initiation of antiretroviral therapy may be a key component of global and national strategies to control the HIV-associated tuberculosis syndemic .

17,"PLoS Biology publishes today a research article by Gunther Eysenbach that is not about biology . It is about citations . It provides robust evidence that open-access articles ( OA articles ) are more immediately recognized and cited than non-OA articles . As such , it adds objective support to the belief we have always held that open-access publication speeds up scientific dialog between researchers and , consequently , should be extended to the whole scientific literature as quickly as possible . It is therefore fitting that we publish such a paper . We have long argued that papers freely available in a journal will be more often read and cited than those behind a subscription barrier . However , solid evidence to support or refute such a claim has been surprisingly hard to find . Since most open-access journals are new , comparisons of the effects of open access with established subscription-based journals are easily confounded by age and reputation . In the current study , Eysenbach compared citations compiled by Thomson Scientific ( formerly Thomson ISI ) to individual articles published between June 2004 and December 2004 in the same journal — namely , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) , which announced its open-access option for authors on June 8 of that year , with an associated publication charge of US$ 1,000 . Non-OA articles in PNAS are subject to a six-month “ toll-access ” delay before the article becomes publicly available . The results of this natural experiment are clear : in the 4 to 16 months following publication , OA articles gained a significant citation advantage over non-OA articles during the same period . They are twice as likely to be cited 4 to 10 months after publication and almost three times as likely between 10 and 16 months . Given that PNAS delays open access for only six months , the disparity between OA and non-OA articles in journals where the delay is longer or where articles remain “ toll-access ” is likely to be even greater . Eysenbach also looked at the impact of self-archiving non-OA articles . One route to open access , it is argued , is for authors to archive their published articles on their own Web sites or in institutional repositories , although this does not include an explicit business model to cover the cost of peer-review and publishing . The analysis revealed that self-archived articles are also cited less often than OA articles from the same journal . Yes , you 're right ; we do have a strong and vested interest in publishing results that so obviously endorse our existence . Moreover , the author of the article is also an editor of an open-access journal . But sometimes a potential conflict of interest can actually help to ensure rigor . In this case , we have an acute interest in ensuring that the article meets the same , if not higher , standards as any other research article we publish . Not only must the conclusions provide a significant advance for the field , but the study must be technically sound , with appropriate evidence to support those conclusions . As with all our research articles , we consulted throughout the evaluation process with an academic editor with appropriate expertise — in this case , Carol Tenopir , professor of information sciences at the University of Tennessee ( Knoxville , Tennessee , United States ) . The article was reviewed by two experts in bibliometric analyses and information science , and an experienced research biologist with expertise in statistics . They all enthusiastically supported publication , although one understandably questioned the suitability of PLoS Biology as the publication venue . We have no intention of making PLoS Biology a regular home for bibliometric studies ( even when about open access ) . What makes this study worth publishing in PLoS Biology is not only the relative strength of evidence supporting the claim but also the extent to which many ( especially other publishers ) have anticipated such an analysis . As far as we are aware , no other study has compared OA and non-OA articles from the same journal and controlled for so many potentially confounding factors . Eysenbach 's multivariate analysis took into account the number of days since publication , number of authors , article type , country of the corresponding author , funding type , subject area , submission track ( PNAS has three different ways that authors can submit a paper ) , and the previous citation record of the first and last authors . He even administered a supplementary questionnaire to assess whether authors choosing the OA option in PNAS chose to do so for only their most important research ( they did n't ) . As Ian Rowlands from the Centre for Publishing at University College London — and one of the reviewers who agreed to be identified in this article — said at the start of his review : “ Many ( most ) of the papers and presentations I have read/seen on this topic have completely failed to address the kinds of confounding issues that are so convincingly tackled here . For that reason alone , this paper deserves to be published and alerted to the widest possible audience . ” In addition to providing evidence for the immediate advantage of open access , Eysenbach 's analysis also highlights several potential challenges to its long-term future . Although a limited dataset , the citation history of the first and last authors differed between those who chose the open-access option and those who did not . In the group that chose open access , last authors tended to have a “ stronger ” previous citation record , whereas this situation was reversed among the group that declined the open-access option — here , it was the first authors who tended to be stronger . This may reflect varying attitudes of authors at different stages of their career , a stronger influence from the leader of a particular group , or an age- or career-related difference in the ability to pay the publication charge ( e.g. , [ 1 ] ) . Indeed , access to appropriate funds may also be a reason why a lower proportion of authors from European countries tended to choose the open-access option . In many of these countries , funds for page charges — and , by extension , open-access publication fees — are often not included within research grants . PNAS was one of the first journals to offer an open-access option to its authors . However , such hybrid journals are increasing : Blackwell , Springer , and Oxford University Press now provide this option as well . This means that similar experiments can be replicated .

18,"PLoS Biology publishes today a research article by Gunther Eysenbach that is not about biology . It is about citations . It provides robust evidence that open-access articles ( OA articles ) are more immediately recognized and cited than non-OA articles . As such , it adds objective support to the belief we have always held that open-access publication speeds up scientific dialog between researchers and , consequently , should be extended to the whole scientific literature as quickly as possible . It is therefore fitting that we publish such a paper . We have long argued that papers freely available in a journal will be more often read and cited than those behind a subscription barrier . However , solid evidence to support or refute such a claim has been surprisingly hard to find . Since most open-access journals are new , comparisons of the effects of open access with established subscription-based journals are easily confounded by age and reputation . In the current study , Eysenbach compared citations compiled by Thomson Scientific ( formerly Thomson ISI ) to individual articles published between June 2004 and December 2004 in the same journal — namely , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) , which announced its open-access option for authors on June 8 of that year , with an associated publication charge of US$ 1,000 . Non-OA articles in PNAS are subject to a six-month “ toll-access ” delay before the article becomes publicly available . The results of this natural experiment are clear : in the 4 to 16 months following publication , OA articles gained a significant citation advantage over non-OA articles during the same period . They are twice as likely to be cited 4 to 10 months after publication and almost three times as likely between 10 and 16 months . Given that PNAS delays open access for only six months , the disparity between OA and non-OA articles in journals where the delay is longer or where articles remain “ toll-access ” is likely to be even greater . Eysenbach also looked at the impact of self-archiving non-OA articles . One route to open access , it is argued , is for authors to archive their published articles on their own Web sites or in institutional repositories , although this does not include an explicit business model to cover the cost of peer-review and publishing . The analysis revealed that self-archived articles are also cited less often than OA articles from the same journal . Yes , you 're right ; we do have a strong and vested interest in publishing results that so obviously endorse our existence . Moreover , the author of the article is also an editor of an open-access journal . But sometimes a potential conflict of interest can actually help to ensure rigor . In this case , we have an acute interest in ensuring that the article meets the same , if not higher , standards as any other research article we publish . Not only must the conclusions provide a significant advance for the field , but the study must be technically sound , with appropriate evidence to support those conclusions . As with all our research articles , we consulted throughout the evaluation process with an academic editor with appropriate expertise — in this case , Carol Tenopir , professor of information sciences at the University of Tennessee ( Knoxville , Tennessee , United States ) . The article was reviewed by two experts in bibliometric analyses and information science , and an experienced research biologist with expertise in statistics . They all enthusiastically supported publication , although one understandably questioned the suitability of PLoS Biology as the publication venue . We have no intention of making PLoS Biology a regular home for bibliometric studies ( even when about open access ) . What makes this study worth publishing in PLoS Biology is not only the relative strength of evidence supporting the claim but also the extent to which many ( especially other publishers ) have anticipated such an analysis . As far as we are aware , no other study has compared OA and non-OA articles from the same journal and controlled for so many potentially confounding factors . Eysenbach 's multivariate analysis took into account the number of days since publication , number of authors , article type , country of the corresponding author , funding type , subject area , submission track ( PNAS has three different ways that authors can submit a paper ) , and the previous citation record of the first and last authors . He even administered a supplementary questionnaire to assess whether authors choosing the OA option in PNAS chose to do so for only their most important research ( they did n't ) . As Ian Rowlands from the Centre for Publishing at University College London — and one of the reviewers who agreed to be identified in this article — said at the start of his review : “ Many ( most ) of the papers and presentations I have read/seen on this topic have completely failed to address the kinds of confounding issues that are so convincingly tackled here . For that reason alone , this paper deserves to be published and alerted to the widest possible audience . ” In addition to providing evidence for the immediate advantage of open access , Eysenbach 's analysis also highlights several potential challenges to its long-term future . Although a limited dataset , the citation history of the first and last authors differed between those who chose the open-access option and those who did not . In the group that chose open access , last authors tended to have a “ stronger ” previous citation record , whereas this situation was reversed among the group that declined the open-access option — here , it was the first authors who tended to be stronger . This may reflect varying attitudes of authors at different stages of their career , a stronger influence from the leader of a particular group , or an age- or career-related difference in the ability to pay the publication charge ( e.g. , [ 1 ] ) . Indeed , access to appropriate funds may also be a reason why a lower proportion of authors from European countries tended to choose the open-access option . In many of these countries , funds for page charges — and , by extension , open-access publication fees — are often not included within research grants . PNAS was one of the first journals to offer an open-access option to its authors . However , such hybrid journals are increasing : Blackwell , Springer , and Oxford University Press now provide this option as well . This means that similar experiments can be replicated .

19,"Podosomes ( also termed invadopodia in cancer cells ) are actin-rich adhesion structures with matrix degradation activity that develop in various cell types . Despite their significant physiological importance , the molecular mechanism of podosome formation is largely unknown . In this study , we investigated the molecular mechanisms of podosome formation . The expression of various phosphoinositide-binding domains revealed that the podosomes in Src-transformed NIH3T3 ( NIH-src ) cells are enriched with PtdIns(3,4)P2 , suggesting an important role of this phosphoinositide in podosome formation . Live-cell imaging analysis revealed that Src-expression stimulated podosome formation at focal adhesions of NIH3T3 cells after PtdIns(3,4)P2 accumulation . The adaptor protein Tks5/FISH , which is essential for podosome formation , was found to form a complex with Grb2 at adhesion sites in an Src-dependent manner . Further , it was found that N-WASP bound all SH3 domains of Tks5/FISH , which facilitated circular podosome formation . These results indicate that augmentation of the N-WASP-Arp2/3 signal was accomplished on the platform of Tks5/FISH-Grb2 complex at focal adhesions , which is stabilized by PtdIns(3,4)P2 .

20,"OBJECTIVE To assess whether population screening for impaired vision among older people in the community leads to improvements in vision . DESIGN Systematic review of randomised controlled trials of population screening in the community that included any assessment of vision or visual function with at least 6 months ' follow up . SUBJECTS Adults aged 65 or over . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Proportions with visual impairment in intervention and control groups with any method of assessing visual impairment . RESULTS There were no trials that primarily assessed visual screening . Outcome data on vision were available for 3494 people in five trials of multiphasic assessment . All the trials used self reported measures for vision impairment , both as screening tools and as outcome measures . The inclusion of a visual screening component in the assessment did not result in improvements in self reported visual problems ( pooled odds ratio 1.04:95 % confidence interval 0.89 to 1.22 ) . A small reduction ( 11 % ) in the number of older people with self reported visual problems can not be excluded . CONCLUSIONS Screening of asymptomatic older people in the community is not justified on present evidence . Visual impairment in this age group can usually be reduced with treatment . It is unclear why no benefit was seen . Further work is needed to clarify what interventions are appropriate for older people with unreported impairment of vision .

21,"UNLABELLED Congruent audiovisual speech enhances our ability to comprehend a speaker , even in noise-free conditions . When incongruent auditory and visual information is presented concurrently , it can hinder a listener 's perception and even cause him or her to perceive information that was not presented in either modality . Efforts to investigate the neural basis of these effects have often focused on the special case of discrete audiovisual syllables that are spatially and temporally congruent , with less work done on the case of natural , continuous speech . Recent electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that cortical response measures to continuous auditory speech can be easily obtained using multivariate analysis methods . Here , we apply such methods to the case of audiovisual speech and , importantly , present a novel framework for indexing multisensory integration in the context of continuous speech . Specifically , we examine how the temporal and contextual congruency of ongoing audiovisual speech affects the cortical encoding of the speech envelope in humans using electroencephalography . We demonstrate that the cortical representation of the speech envelope is enhanced by the presentation of congruent audiovisual speech in noise-free conditions . Furthermore , we show that this is likely attributable to the contribution of neural generators that are not particularly active during unimodal stimulation and that it is most prominent at the temporal scale corresponding to syllabic rate ( 2 - 6 Hz ) . Finally , our data suggest that neural entrainment to the speech envelope is inhibited when the auditory and visual streams are incongruent both temporally and contextually . SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Seeing a speaker 's face as he or she talks can greatly help in understanding what the speaker is saying . This is because the speaker 's facial movements relay information about what the speaker is saying , but also , importantly , when the speaker is saying it . Studying how the brain uses this timing relationship to combine information from continuous auditory and visual speech has traditionally been methodologically difficult . Here we introduce a new approach for doing this using relatively inexpensive and noninvasive scalp recordings . Specifically , we show that the brain 's representation of auditory speech is enhanced when the accompanying visual speech signal shares the same timing . Furthermore , we show that this enhancement is most pronounced at a time scale that corresponds to mean syllable length .

22,"CONTEXT Antibody-based induction therapy plus calcineurin inhibitors ( CNIs ) reduce acute rejection rates in kidney recipients ; however , opportunistic infections and toxic CNI effects remain challenging . Reportedly , mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) have successfully treated graft-vs-host disease . OBJECTIVE To assess autologous MSCs as replacement of antibody induction for patients with end-stage renal disease who undergo ABO-compatible , cross-match-negative kidney transplants from a living-related donor . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PATIENTS One hundred fifty-nine patients were enrolled in this single-site , prospective , open-label , randomized study from February 2008-May 2009 , when recruitment was completed . INTERVENTION Patients were inoculated with marrow-derived autologous MSC ( 1 - 2 x 10(6)/kg ) at kidney reperfusion and two weeks later . Fifty-three patients received standard-dose and 52 patients received low-dose CNIs ( 80 % of standard ) ; 51 patients in the control group received anti-IL-2 receptor antibody plus standard-dose CNIs . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary measure was 1-year incidence of acute rejection and renal function ( estimated glomerular filtration rate [ eGFR ] ) ; the secondary measure was patient and graft survival and incidence of adverse events . RESULTS Patient and graft survival at 13 to 30 months was similar in all groups . After 6 months , 4 of 53 patients ( 7.5 % ) in the autologous MSC plus standard-dose CNI group ( 95 % CI , 0.4%-14.7 % ; P = .04 ) and 4 of 52 patients ( 7.7 % ) in the low-dose group ( 95 % CI , 0.5%-14.9 % ; P = .046 ) compared with 11 of 51 controls ( 21.6 % ; 95 % CI , 10.5%-32.6 % ) had biopsy-confirmed acute rejection . None of the patients in either autologous MSC group had glucorticoid-resistant rejection , whereas 4 patients ( 7.8 % ) in the control group did ( 95 % CI , 0.6%-15.1 % ; overall P = .02 ) .

To determine whether these negative features of aging can be prevented by maintaining efficient autophagic activity until late in life , in this work we have corrected the CMA defect in aged rodents . We have generated a double transgenic mouse model in which the amount of the lysosomal receptor for CMA , previously shown to decrease in abundance with age , can be modulated . We have analyzed in this model the consequences of preventing the age-dependent decrease in receptor abundance in aged rodents at the cellular and organ levels . We show here that CMA activity is maintained until advanced ages if the decrease in the receptor abundance is prevented and that preservation of autophagic activity is associated with lower intracellular accumulation of damaged proteins , better ability to handle protein damage and improved organ function .

26,"IMPORTANCE Bariatric surgery is associated with sustained weight loss and improved physical health status for severely obese individuals . Mental health conditions may be common among patients seeking bariatric surgery ; however , the prevalence of these conditions and whether they are associated with postoperative outcomes remains unknown . OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of mental health conditions among bariatric surgery candidates and recipients , to evaluate the association between preoperative mental health conditions and health outcomes following bariatric surgery , and to evaluate the association between surgery and the clinical course of mental health conditions . DATA SOURCES We searched PubMed , MEDLINE on OVID , and PsycINFO for studies published between January 1988 and November 2015 . Study quality was assessed using an adapted tool for risk of bias ; quality of evidence was rated based on GRADE ( Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation ) criteria . FINDINGS We identified 68 publications meeting inclusion criteria : 59 reporting the prevalence of preoperative mental health conditions ( 65,363 patients ) and 27 reporting associations between preoperative mental health conditions and postoperative outcomes ( 50,182 patients ) . Among patients seeking and undergoing bariatric surgery , the most common mental health conditions , based on random-effects estimates of prevalence , were depression ( 19 % [ 95 % CI , 14%-25 % ] ) and binge eating disorder ( 17 % [ 95 % CI , 13%-21 % ] ) . There was conflicting evidence regarding the association between preoperative mental health conditions and postoperative weight loss . Neither depression nor binge eating disorder was consistently associated with differences in weight outcomes . Bariatric surgery was , however , consistently associated with postoperative decreases in the prevalence of depression ( 7 studies ; 8%-74 % decrease ) and the severity of depressive symptoms ( 6 studies ; 40%-70 % decrease ) . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Mental health conditions are common among bariatric surgery patients-in particular , depression and binge eating disorder .

28,"BACKGROUND Birth size , perhaps a proxy for prenatal environment , might be a correlate of subsequent breast cancer risk , but findings from epidemiological studies have been inconsistent . We re-analysed individual participant data from published and unpublished studies to obtain more precise estimates of the magnitude and shape of the birth size-breast cancer association . METHODS AND FINDINGS Studies were identified through computer-assisted and manual searches , and personal communication with investigators . Individual participant data from 32 studies , comprising 22,058 breast cancer cases , were obtained . Random effect models were used , if appropriate , to combine study-specific estimates of effect . Birth weight was positively associated with breast cancer risk in studies based on birth records ( pooled relative risk [ RR ] per one standard deviation [ SD ] [ = 0.5 kg ] increment in birth weight : 1.06 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.02 - 1.09 ) and parental recall when the participants were children ( 1.02 ; 95 % CI 0.99 - 1.05 ) , but not in those based on adult self-reports , or maternal recall during the woman 's adulthood ( 0.98 ; 95 % CI 0.95 - 1.01 ) ( p for heterogeneity between data sources = 0.003 ) . Relative to women who weighed 3.000 - 3.499 kg , the risk was 0.96 ( CI 0.80 - 1.16 ) in those who weighed < 2.500 kg , and 1.12 ( 95 % CI 1.00 - 1.25 ) in those who weighed > or = 4.000 kg ( p for linear trend = 0.001 ) in birth record data . Birth length and head circumference from birth records were also positively associated with breast cancer risk ( pooled RR per one SD increment : 1.06 [ 95 % CI 1.03 - 1.10 ] and 1.09 [ 95 % CI 1.03 - 1.15 ] , respectively ) . Simultaneous adjustment for these three birth size variables showed that length was the strongest independent predictor of risk . The birth size effects did not appear to be confounded or mediated by established breast cancer risk factors and were not modified by age or menopausal status . The cumulative incidence of breast cancer per 100 women by age 80 y in the study populations was estimated to be 10.0 , 10.0 , 10.4 , and 11.5 in those who were , respectively , in the bottom , second , third , and top fourths of the birth length distribution . CONCLUSIONS This pooled analysis of individual participant data is consistent with birth size , and in particular birth length , being an independent correlate of breast cancer risk in adulthood . INTRODUCTION Various perinatal factors , including birth weight , birth order , maternal age , gestational age , twin status , and parental smoking , have been postulated to affect breast cancer risk in daughters by altering the hormonal environment of the developing fetal mammary glands . Despite ample biologic plausibility , epidemiologic studies to date have yielded conflicting results . We investigated the associations between perinatal factors and subsequent breast cancer risk through meta-analyses . METHODS We reviewed breast cancer studies published from January 1966 to February 2007 that included data on birth weight , birth order , maternal age , gestational age , twin status , and maternal or paternal smoking . Meta-analyses using random effect models were employed to summarize the results . RESULTS We found that heavier birth weights were associated with increased breast cancer risk , with studies involving five categories of birth weight identifying odds ratios ( ORs ) of 1.24 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.04 to 1.48 ) for 4,000 g or more and 1.15 ( 95 % CI 1.04 to 1.26 ) for 3,500 g to 3,999 g , relative to a birth weight of 2,500 to 2,599 g. These studies provided no support for a J-shaped relationship of birthweight to risk . Support for an association with birthweight was also derived from studies based on three birth weight categories ( OR 1.15 [ 95 % CI 1.01 to 1.31 ] for > or = 4,000 g relative to < 3,000 g ) and two birth weight categories ( OR 1.09 [ 95 % CI 1.02 to 1.18 ] for > or = 3,000 g relative to < 3,000 g ) . Women born to older mothers and twins were also at some increased risk , but the results were heterogeneous across studies and publication years . Birth order , prematurity , and maternal smoking were unrelated to breast cancer risk . CONCLUSION Our findings provide some support for the hypothesis that in utero exposures reflective of higher endogenous hormone levels could affect risk for development of breast cancer in adulthood . BACKGROUND Emerging evidence suggests an association between female prenatal experience and her subsequent risk of developing breast cancer . Potential underlying mechanisms include variation in amounts of maternal endogenous sex hormones and growth hormones , germ-cell mutations , formation of cancer stem-cells , and other genetic or epigenetic events . We reviewed and summarised quantitatively the available data on intrauterine exposures and risk of breast cancer . METHODS We systematically searched for studies that assessed association between perinatal factors and risk of breast cancer . We reviewed separately each of the perinatal factors , including birthweight , birth length , parental age at delivery , gestational age , intrauterine exposure to diethylstilbestrol , twin membership , maternal pre-eclampsia or eclampsia , and other factors . FINDINGS We identified 57 studies published between Oct 1 , 1980 , and June 21 , 2007 . Increased risk of breast cancer was noted with increased birthweight ( relative risk [ RR ] 1.15 [ 95 % CI 1.09 - 1.21 ] ) , birth length ( 1.28 [ 1.11 - 1.48 ] ) , higher maternal age ( 1.13 [ 1.02 - 1.25 ] ) , and paternal age ( 1.12 [ 1.05 - 1.19 ] ) . Decreased risk of breast cancer was noted for maternal pre-eclampsia and eclampsia ( 0.48 [ 0.30 - 0.78 ] ) and twin membership ( 0.93 [ 0.87 - 1.00 ] ) . No association was noted between risk of breast cancer and gestational age at birth ( 0.95 [ 0.71 - 1.26 ] ) or maternal diethylstilbestrol treatment ( 1.40 [ 0.86 - 2.28 ] ) . INTERPRETATION The intrauterine environment contributes to the predisposition of women to breast cancer in adulthood . The in-utero mechanisms responsible for such predisposition need to be elucidated . Breast cancer may originate in utero . We reviewed the available evidence on the association between birthweight and the risk of breast cancer . To date , 26 research papers addressing this issue have been published . The majority of studies identified a positive link between birthweight and premenopausal , but not postmenopausal , breast cancer . The relative risk estimate for breast cancer comparing women with high birthweight to women with low birthweight combining all studies including both pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer was 1.23 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.13 - 1.34 ) . The mechanisms underlying this association likely include elevated levels of growth factors that may increase the number of susceptible stem cells in the mammary gland or initiate tumors through DNA mutations . Loss of imprinting ( LOI ) of growth hormone genes relevant for intrauterine growth , such as insulin-like growth factor 2 ( IGF2 ) , leads to abnormally high levels of these hormones evidenced by high birthweight . LOI of IGF2 has also been found in mammary tumor tissue . The role of environmental factors that stimulate such epigenetic regulation of gene expression remains to be elucidated .

29,"Genetic mutations in TAR DNA-binding protein 43 ( TARDBP , also known as TDP-43 ) cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , and an increase in the presence of TDP-43 ( encoded by TARDBP ) in the cytoplasm is a prominent histopathological feature of degenerating neurons in various neurodegenerative diseases . However , the molecular mechanisms by which TDP-43 contributes to ALS pathophysiology remain elusive . Here we have found that TDP-43 accumulates in the mitochondria of neurons in subjects with ALS or frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ) . Disease-associated mutations increase TDP-43 mitochondrial localization . In mitochondria , wild-type ( WT ) and mutant TDP-43 preferentially bind mitochondria-transcribed messenger RNAs ( mRNAs ) encoding respiratory complex I subunits ND3 and ND6 , impair their expression and specifically cause complex I disassembly .

30,"Despite accumulating evidence suggesting local self-maintenance of tissue macrophages in the steady state , the dogma remains that tissue macrophages derive from monocytes . Using parabiosis and fate-mapping approaches , we confirmed that monocytes do not show significant contribution to tissue macrophages in the steady state . Similarly , we found that after depletion of lung macrophages , the majority of repopulation occurred by stochastic cellular proliferation in situ in a macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-Csf)- and granulocyte macrophage (GM)-CSF-dependent manner but independently of interleukin-4 . We also found that after bone marrow transplantation , host macrophages retained the capacity to expand when the development of donor macrophages was compromised . Expansion of host macrophages was functional and prevented the development of alveolar proteinosis in mice transplanted with GM-Csf-receptor-deficient progenitors .

31,"BACKGROUND Information is scarce about the combined effects on breast cancer incidence of low-penetrance genetic susceptibility polymorphisms and environmental factors ( reproductive , behavioural , and anthropometric risk factors for breast cancer ) . To test for evidence of gene-environment interactions , we compared genotypic relative risks for breast cancer across the other risk factors in a large UK prospective study . METHODS We tested gene-environment interactions in 7610 women who developed breast cancer and 10 196 controls without the disease , studying the effects of 12 polymorphisms ( FGFR2-rs2981582 , TNRC9-rs3803662 , 2q35-rs13387042 , MAP3K1-rs889312 , 8q24-rs13281615 , 2p-rs4666451 , 5p12-rs981782 , CASP8-rs1045485 , LSP1-rs3817198 , 5q-rs30099 , TGFB1-rs1982073 , and ATM-rs1800054 ) in relation to prospectively collected information about ten established environmental risk factors ( age at menarche , parity , age at first birth , breastfeeding , menopausal status , age at menopause , use of hormone replacement therapy , body-mass index , height , and alcohol consumption ) . FINDINGS After allowance for multiple testing none of the 120 comparisons yielded significant evidence of a gene-environment interaction . By contrast with previous suggestions , there was little evidence that the genotypic relative risks were affected by use of hormone replacement therapy , either overall or for oestrogen-receptor-positive disease . Only one of the 12 polymorphisms was correlated with any of the ten other risk factors : carriers of the high-risk C allele of MAP3K1-rs889312 were significantly shorter than non-carriers ( mean height 162.4 cm [ 95 % CI 162.1 - 162.7 ] vs 163.1 cm [ 162.9 - 163.2 ] ; p=0.01 after allowance for multiple testing ) .

32,"Background Checkpoint kinase 2 ( CHEK2 ) averts cancer development by promoting cell cycle arrest and activating DNA repair in genetically damaged cells . Previous investigation has established a role for the CHEK2 gene in breast cancer aetiology , but studies have largely been limited to the rare 1100delC mutation . Whether common polymorphisms in this gene influence breast cancer risk remains unknown . In this study , we aimed to assess the importance of common CHEK2 variants on population risk for breast cancer by capturing the majority of diversity in the gene using haplotype tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms ( tagSNPs ) . Methods and Findings We analyzed 14 common SNPs spanning 52 kilobases ( kb ) of the CHEK2 gene in 92 Swedish women . Coverage evaluation indicated that these typed SNPs would efficiently convey association signal also from untyped SNPs in the same region . Six of the 14 SNPs predicted well both the haplotypic and single SNP variations within CHEK2 . We genotyped these six tagSNPs in 1,577 postmenopausal breast cancer cases and 1,513 population controls , but found no convincing association between any common CHEK2 haplotype and breast cancer risk . The 1100delC mutation was rare in our Swedish population—0.7 % in cases and 0.4 % in controls— with a corresponding odds ratio for carriers versus noncarriers of 2.26 ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.99–5.15 ) . Estimates of the population frequency and the odds ratio of 1100delC indicate that our sample is representative of a Northern European population .

33,"In mammals , caloric restriction consistently results in extended lifespan .

Twenty-two to 30-year-old rhesus monkeys exposed to 30 % caloric restriction since 7 - 14 years of age showed attenuation of age-related methylation drift compared to ad libitum-fed controls such that their blood methylation age appeared 7 years younger than their chronologic age . Even more pronounced effects were seen in 2.7 - 3.2-year-old mice exposed to 40 % caloric restriction starting at 0.3 years of age . The effects of caloric restriction on DNA methylation were detectable across different tissues and correlated with gene expression .

38,"BACKGROUND Alcohol has been reported to be a common and modifiable risk factor for hypertension . However , observational studies are subject to confounding by other behavioural and sociodemographic factors , while clinical trials are difficult to implement and have limited follow-up time . Mendelian randomization can provide robust evidence on the nature of this association by use of a common polymorphism in aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 ( ALDH2 ) as a surrogate for measuring alcohol consumption . ALDH2 encodes a major enzyme involved in alcohol metabolism . Individuals homozygous for the null variant ( * 2 * 2 ) experience adverse symptoms when drinking alcohol and consequently drink considerably less alcohol than wild-type homozygotes ( * 1 * 1 ) or heterozygotes . We hypothesise that this polymorphism may influence the risk of hypertension by affecting alcohol drinking behaviour . METHODS AND FINDINGS We carried out fixed effect meta-analyses of the ALDH2 genotype with blood pressure ( five studies , n = 7,658 ) and hypertension ( three studies , n = 4,219 ) using studies identified via systematic review . In males , we obtained an overall odds ratio of 2.42 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.66 - 3.55 , p = 4.8 x 10(-6 ) ) for hypertension comparing * 1 * 1 with * 2 * 2 homozygotes and an odds ratio of 1.72 ( 95 % CI 1.17 - 2.52 , p = 0.006 ) comparing heterozygotes ( surrogate for moderate drinkers ) with * 2 * 2 homozygotes . Systolic blood pressure was 7.44 mmHg ( 95 % CI 5.39 - 9.49 , p = 1.1 x 10(-12 ) ) greater among * 1 * 1 than among * 2 * 2 homozygotes , and 4.24 mmHg ( 95 % CI 2.18 - 6.31 , p = 0.00005 ) greater among heterozygotes than among * 2 * 2 homozygotes . CONCLUSIONS These findings support the hypothesis that alcohol intake has a marked effect on blood pressure and the risk of hypertension .

DESIGN Follow-up study , with survival of twins determined up to January 2008 , by which time 675 ( 37 % ) had died . SETTING Population based twin cohort in Denmark . PARTICIPANTS 20 nurses , 10 young men , and 11 older women ( assessors ) ; 1826 twins aged > or=70 . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Assessors : perceived age of twins from photographs . Twins : physical and cognitive tests and molecular biomarker of ageing ( leucocyte telomere length ) . RESULTS For all three groups of assessors , perceived age was significantly associated with survival , even after adjustment for chronological age , sex , and rearing environment . Perceived age was still significantly associated with survival after further adjustment for physical and cognitive functioning . The likelihood that the older looking twin of the pair died first increased with increasing discordance in perceived age within the twin pair-that is , the bigger the difference in perceived age within the pair , the more likely that the older looking twin died first . Twin analyses suggested that common genetic factors influence both perceived age and survival . Perceived age , controlled for chronological age and sex , also correlated significantly with physical and cognitive functioning as well as with leucocyte telomere length .

44,"BACKGROUND Endothelium-dependent modulation of coronary tone is impaired in the collateral-dependent coronary microcirculation . We used a porcine model of chronic coronary occlusion and collateral development to evaluate the hypothesis that exercise training enhances endothelium-mediated relaxation and increases endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( ecNOS ) mRNA levels of collateral-dependent microvasculature . METHODS AND RESULTS Adult female miniature swine were subjected to chronic , progressive ameroid occlusion of the proximal left circumflex coronary artery ( LCx ) ; after 2 months , animals were randomly exposed to 16-week exercise-training ( EX group ; treadmill running ) or sedentary ( SED group ; cage confinement ) protocols . After completion of EX or SED programs , coronary arterioles ( approximately 100 microm in diameter ) were isolated from collateral-dependent LCx ( distal to occlusion ) and nonoccluded left anterior descending coronary artery ( LAD ) regions of each heart . Arterioles were studied by in vitro videomicroscopy or frozen for ecNOS mRNA analysis ( RT-PCR techniques ) . Relaxation to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator bradykinin was decreased ( P<0.05 ) in arterioles isolated from collateral-dependent LCx versus nonoccluded LAD regions of SED animals . Bradykinin-mediated relaxation , however , was not different in LCx versus LAD arterioles isolated from EX animals . Nitroprusside-induced relaxation was unaffected by either chronic occlusion or exercise . Importantly , ecNOS mRNA expression was significantly decreased in arterioles isolated from LCx versus LAD regions of SED animals . After training , ecNOS mRNA expression was not different between LAD and LCx arterioles . CONCLUSIONS These data indicate that exercise training enhances bradykinin-mediated relaxation of collateral-dependent LCx arterioles isolated after chronic coronary occlusion , most likely because of effects on ecNOS mRNA expression and increased production of NO . BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that vasodilator responses of porcine coronary resistance arteries are increased by exercise training . METHODS AND RESULTS Yucatan miniature swine were randomly divided into groups of exercise-trained ( ET ) and sedentary ( SED ) control pigs . ET pigs were placed on a progressive treadmill training program lasting 16 to 20 weeks , and SED pigs remained inactive during the same time period . Coronary resistance arteries 64 to 157 microns in diameter were isolated for in vitro evaluation of relaxation responses to the endothelium-independent dilators sodium nitroprusside ( 1 x 10(-10 ) to 1 x 10(-4 ) mol/L ) and adenosine ( 1 x 10(-10 ) to 1 x 10(-5 ) mol/L ) and to bradykinin ( 1 x 10(-13 ) to 3 x 10(-7 ) mol/L ) , an endothelium-dependent agent . Relaxation responses to adenosine and sodium nitroprusside were not altered by exercise training . Endothelium-dependent relaxation to bradykinin was enhanced in coronary resistance arteries from ET pigs ( IC50 : ET , 0.07 + /- 0.02 nmol/L ; SED , 1.59 + /- 0.09 nmol/L ) . To determine whether prostanoids and/or the nitric oxide synthase pathway were involved in the ET-induced changes in bradykinin-induced vasodilation , responses to bradykinin were examined in coronary resistance arteries from both ET and SED pigs in the presence of indomethacin and in the presence of nitro-monomethyl L-arginine ( L-NMMA ) . Both indomethacin and L-NMMA produced significant inhibition of the bradykinin-induced relaxation in vessels from both groups . Despite decreased bradykinin-induced relaxation after indomethacin , bradykinin-induced vasodilation was still enhanced in vessels from the ET group . L-NMMA caused greater inhibition of the bradykinin-induced relaxation in coronary resistance arteries from ET pigs relative to arteries from SED pigs and eliminated the training-induced enhancement of the bradykinin responses . CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that exercise training enhances bradykinin-induced vasodilation through increased endothelium-derived relaxing factor/nitric oxide production by the L-arginine/nitric oxide synthase pathway .

45,"IMPORTANCE Combining pharmacotherapies for tobacco-dependence treatment may increase smoking abstinence . OBJECTIVE To determine efficacy and safety of varenicline and bupropion sustained-release ( SR ; combination therapy ) compared with varenicline ( monotherapy ) in cigarette smokers . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized , blinded , placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial with a 12-week treatment period and follow-up through week 52 conducted between October 2009 and April 2013 at 3 midwestern clinical research sites . Five hundred six adult ( ≥18 years ) cigarette smokers were randomly assigned and 315 ( 62 % ) completed the study . INTERVENTIONS Twelve weeks of varenicline and bupropion SR or varenicline and placebo . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was abstinence rates at week 12 , defined as prolonged ( no smoking from 2 weeks after the target quit date ) abstinence and 7-day point-prevalence ( no smoking past 7 days ) abstinence . Secondary outcomes were prolonged and point-prevalence smoking abstinence rates at weeks 26 and 52 . Outcomes were biochemically confirmed . RESULTS At 12 weeks , 53.0 % of the combination therapy group achieved prolonged smoking abstinence and 56.2 % achieved 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence compared with 43.2 % and 48.6 % in varenicline monotherapy ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 1.49 ; 95 % CI , 1.05 - 2.12 ; P = .03 and OR , 1.36 ; 95 % CI , 0.95 - 1.93 ; P = .09 , respectively ) . At 26 weeks , 36.6 % of the combination therapy group achieved prolonged and 38.2 % achieved 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence compared with 27.6 % and 31.9 % in varenicline monotherapy ( OR , 1.52 ; 95 % CI , 1.04 - 2.22 ; P = .03 and OR , 1.32 ; 95 % CI , 0.91 - 1.91 ; P = .14 , respectively ) . At 52 weeks , 30.9 % of the combination therapy group achieved prolonged and 36.6 % achieved 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence compared with 24.5 % and 29.2 % in varenicline monotherapy ( OR , 1.39 ; 95 % CI , 0.93 - 2.07 ; P = .11 and OR , 1.40 ; 95 % CI , 0.96 - 2.05 ; P = .08 , respectively ) . Participants receiving combination therapy reported more anxiety ( 7.2 % vs 3.1 % ; P = .04 ) and depressive symptoms ( 3.6 % vs 0.8 % ; P = .03 ) . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among cigarette smokers , combined use of varenicline and bupropion , compared with varenicline alone , increased prolonged abstinence but not 7-day point prevalence at 12 and 26 weeks . Neither outcome was significantly different at 52 weeks . Further research is required to determine the role of combination therapy in smoking cessation .

46,"Somatic mutations that activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3 K ) have been identified in the p110-alpha catalytic subunit ( encoded by PIK3CA ) . They are most frequently observed in two hotspots : the helical domain ( E545 K and E542 K ) and the kinase domain ( H1047R ) . Although the p110-alpha mutants are transforming in vitro , their oncogenic potential has not been assessed in genetically engineered mouse models . Furthermore , clinical trials with PI3 K inhibitors have recently been initiated , and it is unknown if their efficacy will be restricted to specific , genetically defined malignancies . In this study , we engineered a mouse model of lung adenocarcinomas initiated and maintained by expression of p110-alpha H1047R . Treatment of these tumors with NVP-BEZ235 , a dual pan-PI3 K and mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibitor in clinical development , led to marked tumor regression as shown by positron emission tomography-computed tomography , magnetic resonance imaging and microscopic examination . In contrast , mouse lung cancers driven by mutant Kras did not substantially respond to single-agent NVP-BEZ235 . However , when NVP-BEZ235 was combined with a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( MEK ) inhibitor , ARRY-142886 , there was marked synergy in shrinking these Kras-mutant cancers . These in vivo studies suggest that inhibitors of the PI3K-mTOR pathway may be active in cancers with PIK3CA mutations and , when combined with MEK inhibitors , may effectively treat KRAS mutated lung cancers . Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( PI3 K ) pathway deregulation is a common event in human cancer , either through inactivation of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10 or activating mutations of p110-alpha . These hotspot mutations result in oncogenic activity of the enzyme and contribute to therapeutic resistance to the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab . The PI3 K pathway is , therefore , an attractive target for cancer therapy . We have studied NVP-BEZ235 , a dual inhibitor of the PI3 K and the downstream mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) . NVP-BEZ235 inhibited the activation of the downstream effectors Akt , S6 ribosomal protein , and 4EBP1 in breast cancer cells . The antiproliferative activity of NVP-BEZ235 was superior to the allosteric selective mTOR complex inhibitor everolimus in a panel of 21 cancer cell lines of different origin and mutation status . The described Akt activation due to mTOR inhibition was prevented by higher doses of NVP-BEZ235 . NVP-BEZ235 reversed the hyperactivation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway caused by the oncogenic mutations of p110-alpha , E545 K , and H1047R , and inhibited the proliferation of HER2-amplified BT474 cells exogenously expressing these mutations that render them resistant to trastuzumab . In trastuzumab-resistant BT474 H1047R breast cancer xenografts , NVP-BEZ235 inhibited PI3 K signaling and had potent antitumor activity . In treated animals , there was complete inhibition of PI3 K signaling in the skin at pharmacologically active doses , suggesting that skin may serve as surrogate tissue for pharmacodynamic studies . In summary , NVP-BEZ235 inhibits the PI3K/mTOR axis and results in antiproliferative and antitumoral activity in cancer cells with both wild-type and mutated p110-alpha .

47,"The non-enveloped bacilliform viruses are the second group of plant viruses known to possess a genome consisting of circular double-stranded DNA . We have characterized the viral transcript and determined the complete sequence of the genome of Commelina mellow mottle virus ( CoYMV ) , a member of this group . Analysis of the viral transcript indicates that the virus encodes a single terminally-redundant genome-length plus 120 nucleotide transcript . A fraction of the transcripts is polyadenylated , although the majority of the transcript is not polyadenylated . Analysis of the genome sequence indicates that the genome is 7489 bp in size and that the transcribed strand contains three open reading frames capable of encoding proteins of 23 , 15 and 216 kd . The function of the 25 and 15 kd proteins is unknown . Similarities between the 216 kd polypeptide and the cauliflower mosaic virus coat protein and protease/reverse transcriptase polyprotein suggest that the 216 kd polypeptide is a polyprotein that is proteolytically processed to yield the virion coat protein , a protease , and replicase ( reverse transcriptase and ribonuclease H ) . Each strand of the CoYMV genome is interrupted by site-specific discontinuities . The locations of the 5'-ends of these discontinuities , and the presence and location of a region on the CoYMV transcript capable of annealing with the 3'-end of cytosolic initiator methionine tRNA are consistent with replication by reverse transcription .

52,"CONTEXT Dexamethasone is widely used to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting ( PONV ) in pediatric tonsillectomy . OBJECTIVE To assess whether dexamethasone dose-dependently reduces the risk of PONV at 24 hours after tonsillectomy . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PATIENTS Randomized placebo-controlled trial conducted among 215 children undergoing elective tonsillectomy at a major public teaching hospital in Switzerland from February 2005 to December 2007 . INTERVENTIONS Children were randomly assigned to receive dexamethasone ( 0.05 , 0.15 , or 0.5 mg/kg ) or placebo intravenously after induction of anesthesia . Acetaminophen-codeine and ibuprofen were given as postoperative analgesia . Follow-up continued until the 10th postoperative day . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary end point was prevention of PONV at 24 hours ; secondary end points were decrease in the need for ibuprofen at 24 hours and evaluation of adverse effects . RESULTS At 24 hours , 24 of 54 participants who received placebo ( 44 % ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 31%-59 % ) had experienced PONV compared with 20 of 53 ( 38 % ; 95 % CI , 25%-52 % ) , 13 of 54 ( 24 % ; 95 % CI , 13%-38 % ) , and 6 of 52 ( 12 % ; 95 % CI , 4%-23 % ) who received dexamethasone at 0.05 , 0.15 , and 0.5 mg/kg , respectively ( P<.001 for linear trend ) . Children who received dexamethasone received significantly less ibuprofen . There were 26 postoperative bleeding episodes in 22 children . Two of 53 ( 4 % ; 95 % CI , 0.5%-13 % ) children who received placebo had bleeding compared with 6 of 53 ( 11 % ; 95 % CI , 4%-23 % ) , 2 of 51 ( 4 % ; 95 % CI , 0.5%-13 % ) , and 12 of 50 ( 24 % ; 95 % CI , 13%-38 % ) who received dexamethasone at 0.05 , 0.15 , and 0.5 mg/kg , respectively ( P = .003 ) . Dexamethasone , 0.5 mg/kg , was associated with the highest bleeding risk ( adjusted relative risk , 6.80 ; 95 % CI , 1.77 - 16.5 ) . Eight children had to undergo emergency reoperation because of bleeding , all of whom had received dexamethasone . The trial was stopped early for safety reasons .

53,"BACKGROUND Although unstable coronary artery disease is the most common reason for admission to a coronary care unit , the long-term prognosis of patients with this diagnosis is unknown . This is particularly true for patients with diabetes mellitus , who are known to have a high morbidity and mortality after an acute myocardial infarction . METHODS AND RESULTS Prospectively collected data from 6 different countries in the Organization to Assess Strategies for Ischemic Syndromes ( OASIS ) registry were analyzed to determine the 2-year prognosis of diabetic and nondiabetic patients who were hospitalized with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction . Overall , 1718 of 8013 registry patients ( 21 % ) had diabetes . Diabetic patients had a higher rate of coronary bypass surgery than nondiabetic patients ( 23 % versus 20 % , P:<0.001 ) but had similar rates of catheterization and angioplasty . Diabetes independently predicted mortality ( relative risk [ RR ] , 1.57 ; 95 % CI , 1.38 to 1.81 ; P:<0.001 ) , as well as cardiovascular death , new myocardial infarction , stroke , and new congestive heart failure . Moreover , compared with their nondiabetic counterparts , women had a significantly higher risk than men ( RR , 1.98 ; 95 % CI , 1.60 to 2.44 ; and RR , 1.28 ; 95 % CI , 1.06 to 1.56 , respectively ) . Interestingly , diabetic patients without prior cardiovascular disease had the same event rates for all outcomes as nondiabetic patients with previous vascular disease . CONCLUSIONS Hospitalization for unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction predicts a high 2-year morbidity and mortality ; this is especially evident for patients with diabetes .

54,"Inflammation induced by recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns markedly affects subsequent adaptive responses . We asked whether the adaptive immune system can also affect the character and magnitude of innate inflammatory responses . We found that the response of memory , but not naive , CD4 + T cells enhances production of multiple innate inflammatory cytokines and chemokines ( IICs ) in the lung and that , during influenza infection , this leads to early control of virus . Memory CD4 + T cell – induced IICs and viral control require cognate antigen recognition and are optimal when memory cells are either T helper type 1 ( TH1 ) or TH17 polarized but are independent of interferon-γ ( IFN-γ ) and tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) production and do not require activation of conserved pathogen recognition pathways .

Most errors occurred when giving bolus doses or making up drugs that required multiple step preparation . CONCLUSIONS The rate of intravenous drug errors was high . Although most errors would cause only short term adverse effects , a few could have been serious .

SETTING Nurses ' Health Study . PARTICIPANTS 71,271 women enrolled in the Nurses ' Health Study residing throughout the contiguous United States who had valid estimates on exposure to particulate matter for at least one exposure period of interest and data on anxiety symptoms . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Meaningfully high symptoms of anxiety , defined as a score of 6 points or greater on the phobic anxiety subscale of the Crown-Crisp index , administered in 2004 . RESULTS The 71,271 eligible women were aged between 57 and 85 years ( mean 70 years ) at the time of assessment of anxiety symptoms , with a prevalence of high anxiety symptoms of 15 % . Exposure to particulate matter was characterized using estimated average exposure to particulate matter < 2.5 μm in diameter ( PM2.5 ) and 2.5 to 10 μm in diameter ( PM2.5 - 10 ) in the one month , three months , six months , one year , and 15 years prior to assessment of anxiety symptoms , and residential distance to the nearest major road two years prior to assessment . Significantly increased odds of high anxiety symptoms were observed with higher exposure to PM2.5 for multiple averaging periods ( for example , odds ratio per 10 µg/m(3 ) increase in prior one month average PM2.5 : 1.12 , 95 % confidence interval 1.06 to 1.19 ; in prior 12 month average PM2.5 : 1.15 , 1.06 to 1.26 ) . Models including multiple exposure windows suggested short term averaging periods were more relevant than long term averaging periods . There was no association between anxiety and exposure to PM2.5 - 10 . Residential proximity to major roads was not related to anxiety symptoms in a dose dependent manner . CONCLUSIONS Exposure to fine particulate matter ( PM2.5 ) was associated with high symptoms of anxiety , with more recent exposures potentially more relevant than more distant exposures .

A relationship between long-term exposure to endogenous estrogens and incident dementia has been hypothesized but not studied . OBJECTIVE To determine whether a longer reproductive period , as an indicator of longer exposure to endogenous estrogens , is associated with lower risk of dementia and Alzheimer disease ( AD ) in women who have natural menopause . DESIGN AND SETTING The Rotterdam Study , a population-based prospective cohort study conducted in the Netherlands . PARTICIPANTS A total of 3601 women aged 55 years or older who did not have dementia at baseline ( 1990 - 1993 ) and had information on age at menarche , age at menopause , and type of menopause . Participants were reexamined in 1993 - 1994 and 1997 - 1999 and were continuously monitored for development of dementia . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Incidence of dementia , based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Revised Third Edition criteria , and AD , based on National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer 's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria , compared by quartiles of reproductive period among women with natural menopause . RESULTS During 21 046 person-years of follow-up ( median follow-up , 6.3 years ) , 199 women developed dementia , including 159 who developed AD . After adjusting for age , dementia was not clearly associated with length of reproductive period . However , after adjusting for multiple covariates , women with natural menopause and more reproductive years had an increased risk of dementia ( adjusted rate ratio [ RR ] for women with > 39 reproductive years [ highest quartile ] compared with < 34 reproductive years [ lowest quartile ] , 1.78 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.12 - 2.84 ) . The adjusted RR per year of increase was 1.04 ( 95 % CI , 1.01 - 1.08 ) . For risk of AD , the adjusted RRs were 1.51 ( 95 % CI , 0.91 - 2.50 ) and 1.03 ( 95 % CI , 1.00 - 1.07 ) , respectively . Risk of dementia associated with a longer reproductive period was most pronounced in APOE epsilon4 carriers ( adjusted RR for > 39 reproductive years compared with < 34 reproductive years , 4.20 [ 95 % CI , 1.97 - 8.92 ] for dementia and 3.42 [ 95 % CI , 1.51 - 7.75 ] for AD ) , whereas in noncarriers , no clear association with dementia or AD was observed .

Transcription factor GATA-3 is known to be vital for the development of T cells at multiple stages in the thymus and for Th2 differentiation in the peripheral organs . Although it is well documented that GATA-3 is expressed in HSCs , a role for GATA-3 in any prethymic progenitor cell has not been established . In the present study , we show that Gata3-null mutant mice generate fewer LT-HSCs and that fewer Gata3-null LT-HSCs are in cycle .

62,"Genetically identical cells sharing an environment can display markedly different phenotypes . It is often unclear how much of this variation derives from chance , external signals , or attempts by individual cells to exert autonomous phenotypic programs . By observing thousands of cells for hundreds of consecutive generations under constant conditions , we dissect the stochastic decision between a solitary , motile state and a chained , sessile state in Bacillus subtilis . We show that the motile state is ' memoryless ' , exhibiting no autonomous control over the time spent in the state . In contrast , the time spent as connected chains of cells is tightly controlled , enforcing coordination among related cells in the multicellular state . We show that the three-protein regulatory circuit governing the decision is modular , as initiation and maintenance of chaining are genetically separable functions . As stimulation of the same initiating pathway triggers biofilm formation , we argue that autonomous timing allows a trial commitment to multicellularity that external signals could extend . Gene expression is a fundamentally stochastic process , with randomness in transcription and translation leading to cell-to-cell variations in mRNA and protein levels . This variation appears in organisms ranging from microbes to metazoans , and its characteristics depend both on the biophysical parameters governing gene expression and on gene network structure . Stochastic gene expression has important consequences for cellular function , being beneficial in some contexts and harmful in others .

DESIGN Population based , cross sectional study . SETTING Epidemiology of Vascular Ageing study , Nantes , France . PARTICIPANTS 780 participants ( mean age 69 , 58.5 % women ) with detailed headache assessment . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Brain scans were evaluated for volume of white matter hyperintensities ( by fully automated imaging processing ) and for classification of infarcts ( by visual reading with a standardised assessment grid ) . Cognitive function was assessed by a battery of tests including the mini-mental state examination . RESULTS 163 ( 20.9 % ) participants reported a history of severe headache and 116 had migraine , of whom 17 ( 14.7 % ) reported aura symptoms . An association was found between any history of severe headache and increasing volume of white matter hyperintensities . The adjusted odds ratio of being in the highest third for total volume of white matter hyperintensities was 2.0 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.3 to 3.1 , P for trend 0.002 ) for participants with any history of severe headache when compared with participants without severe headache being in the lowest third . The association pattern was similar for all headache types . Migraine with aura was the only headache type strongly associated with volume of deep white matter hyperintensities ( highest third odds ratio 12.4 , 1.6 to 99.4 , P for trend 0.005 ) and with brain infarcts ( 3.4 , 1.2 to 9.3 ) . The location of infarcts was predominantly outside the cerebellum and brain stem . Evidence was lacking for cognitive impairment for any headache type with or without brain lesions . CONCLUSIONS In this population based study , any history of severe headache was associated with an increased volume of white matter hyperintensities .

65,"CONTEXT Population surveys indicate that physical activity levels are low in the United States . One consequence of inactivity , low cardiorespiratory fitness , is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) morbidity and mortality , but the prevalence of cardiorespiratory fitness has not been quantified in representative US population samples . OBJECTIVES To describe the prevalence of low fitness in the US population aged 12 through 49 years and to relate low fitness to CVD risk factors in this population . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Inception cohort study using data from the cross-sectional nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999 - 2002 . Participants were adolescents ( aged 12 - 19 years ; n = 3110 ) and adults ( aged 20 - 49 years ; n = 2205 ) free from previously diagnosed CVD who underwent submaximal graded exercise treadmill testing to achieve at least 75 % to 90 % of their age-predicted maximum heart rate . Maximal oxygen consumption ( VO2max ) was estimated by measuring the heart rate response to reference levels of submaximal work . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Low fitness defined using percentile cut points of estimated VO2max from existing external referent populations ; anthropometric and other CVD risk factors measured according to standard methods . RESULTS Low fitness was identified in 33.6 % of adolescents ( approximately 7.5 million US adolescents ) and 13.9 % of adults ( approximately 8.5 million US adults ) ; the prevalence was similar in adolescent females ( 34.4 % ) and males ( 32.9 % ) ( P = .40 ) but was higher in adult females ( 16.2 % ) than in males ( 11.8 % ) ( P = .03 ) . Non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans were less fit than non-Hispanic whites . In all age-sex groups , body mass index and waist circumference were inversely associated with fitness ; age- and race-adjusted odds ratios of overweight or obesity ( body mass index > or = 25 ) ranged from 2.1 to 3.7 ( P<.01 for all ) , comparing persons with low fitness with those with moderate or high fitness . Total cholesterol levels and systolic blood pressure were higher and levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were lower among participants with low vs high fitness .

66,"IMPORTANCE Exacerbations of respiratory symptoms in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) have profound and long-lasting adverse effects on patients . OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers in individuals with stable COPD are associated with an increased risk of having exacerbations . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective cohort study examining 61,650 participants with spirometry measurements from the Copenhagen City Heart Study ( 2001 - 2003 ) and the Copenhagen General Population Study ( 2003 - 2008 ) . Of these , 6574 had COPD , defined as a ratio between forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 ) and forced vital capacity below 0.7 . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Baseline levels of C-reactive protein ( CRP ) and fibrinogen and leukocyte count were measured in participants at a time when they were not experiencing symptoms of exacerbations . Exacerbations were recorded and defined as short-course treatment with oral corticosteroids alone or in combination with an antibiotic or as a hospital admission due to COPD . Levels of CRP and fibrinogen and leukocyte count were defined as high or low according to cut points of 3 mg/L , 14 μmol/L , and 9 ×10(9)/L , respectively . RESULTS During follow-up , 3083 exacerbations were recorded ( mean , 0.5/participant ) . In the first year of follow-up , multivariable-adjusted odds ratios for having frequent exacerbations were 1.2 ( 95 % CI , 0.7 - 2.2 ; 17 events/1000 person-years ) for individuals with 1 high biomarker , 1.7 ( 95 % CI , 0.9 - 3.2 ; 32 events/1000 person-years ) for individuals with 2 high biomarkers , and 3.7 ( 95 % CI , 1.9 - 7.4 ; 81 events/1000 person-years ) for individuals with 3 high biomarkers compared with individuals who had no elevated biomarkers ( 9 events/1000 person-years ; trend : P = 2 × 10(-5 ) ) . Corresponding hazard ratios using maximum follow-up time were 1.4 ( 95 % CI , 1.1 - 1.8 ) , 1.6 ( 95 % CI , 1.3 - 2.2 ) , and 2.5 ( 95 % CI , 1.8 - 3.4 ) , respectively ( trend : P = 1 × 10(-8 ) ) . The addition of inflammatory biomarkers to a basic model including age , sex , FEV1 percent predicted , smoking , use of any inhaled medication , body mass index , history of previous exacerbations , and time since most recent prior exacerbation improved the C statistics from 0.71 to 0.73 ( comparison : P = 9 × 10(-5 ) ) . Relative risks were consistent in those with milder COPD , in those with no history of frequent exacerbations , and in the 2 studies separately . The highest 5-year absolute risks of having frequent exacerbations in those with 3 high biomarkers ( vs no high biomarkers ) were 62 % ( vs 24 % ) for those with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ( GOLD ) grades C-D ( n = 558 ) , 98 % ( vs 64 % ) in those with a history of frequent exacerbations ( n = 127 ) , and 52 % ( vs 15 % ) for those with GOLD grades 3 - 4 ( n = 465 ) . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Simultaneously elevated levels of CRP and fibrinogen and leukocyte count in individuals with COPD were associated with increased risk of having exacerbations , even in those with milder COPD and in those without previous exacerbations . Further investigation is needed to determine the clinical value of these biomarkers for risk stratification . [SEP] High levels of CRP reduces the risk of exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).",REFUTES,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]"
67,"OBJECTIVE To obtain summary estimates of the accuracy of a single baseline measurement of the Elecsys Troponin T high-sensitive assay ( Roche Diagnostics ) for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients presenting to the emergency department . DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy studies . DATA SOURCES Medline , Embase , and other relevant electronic databases were searched for papers published between January 2006 and December 2013 . STUDY SELECTION Studies were included if they evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of a single baseline measurement of Elecsys Troponin T high-sensitive assay for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected acute coronary syndrome . STUDY APPRAISAL AND DATA SYNTHESIS The first author screened all titles and abstracts identified through the searches and selected all potentially relevant papers . The screening of the full texts , the data extraction , and the methodological quality assessment , using the adapted QUADAS-2 tool , were conducted independently by two reviewers with disagreements being resolved through discussion or arbitration . If appropriate , meta-analysis was conducted using the hierarchical bivariate model . RESULTS Twenty three studies reported the performance of the evaluated assay at presentation . The results for 14 ng/L and 3 - 5 ng/L cut-off values were pooled separately . At 14 ng/L ( 20 papers ) , the summary sensitivity was 89.5 % ( 95 % confidence interval 86.3 % to 92.1 % ) and the summary specificity was 77.1 % ( 68.7 % to 83.7 % ) . At 3 - 5 ng/L ( six papers ) , the summary sensitivity was 97.4 % ( 94.9 % to 98.7 % ) and the summary specificity was 42.4 % ( 31.2 % to 54.5 % ) . This means that if 21 of 100 consecutive patients have the target condition ( 21 % , the median prevalence across the studies ) , 2 ( 95 % confidence interval 2 to 3 ) of 21 patients with acute myocardial infarction will be missed ( false negatives ) if 14 ng/L is used as a cut-off value and 18 ( 13 to 25 ) of 79 patients without acute myocardial infarction will test positive ( false positives ) . If the 3 - 5 ng/L cut-off value is used , < 1 ( 0 to 1 ) patient with acute myocardial infarction will be missed and 46 ( 36 to 54 ) patients without acute myocardial infarction will test positive . CONCLUSIONS The results indicate that a single baseline measurement of the Elecsys Troponin T high-sensitive assay could be used to rule out acute myocardial infarction if lower cut-off values such as 3 ng/L or 5 ng/L are used . However , this method should be part of a comprehensive triage strategy and may not be appropriate for patients who present less than three hours after symptom onset . Care must also be exercised because of the higher imprecision of the evaluated assay and the greater effect of lot-to-lot reagent variation at low troponin concentrations .

68,"Nuclear receptors undergo ligand-dependent conformational changes that are required for corepressor-coactivator exchange , but whether there is an actual requirement for specific epigenetic landmarks to impose ligand dependency for gene activation remains unknown . Here we report an unexpected and general strategy that is based on the requirement for specific cohorts of inhibitory histone methyltransferases ( HMTs ) to impose gene-specific gatekeeper functions that prevent unliganded nuclear receptors and other classes of regulated transcription factors from binding to their target gene promoters and causing constitutive gene activation in the absence of stimulating signals . This strategy , based at least in part on an HMT-dependent inhibitory histone code , imposes a requirement for specific histone demethylases , including LSD1 , to permit ligand- and signal-dependent activation of regulated gene expression . These events link an inhibitory methylation component of the histone code to a broadly used strategy that circumvents pathological constitutive gene induction by physiologically regulated transcription factors .

69,"One hypothesis that couples infection with autoimmune disease is molecular mimicry . Molecular mimicry is characterized by an immune response to an environmental agent that cross-reacts with a host antigen , resulting in disease . This hypothesis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes , lupus and multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . There is limited direct evidence linking causative agents with pathogenic immune reactions in these diseases . Our study establishes a clear link between viral infection , autoimmunity and neurological disease in humans . As a model for molecular mimicry , we studied patients with human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis ( HAM/TSP ) , a disease that can be indistinguishable from MS ( refs . 5,6,7 ) . HAM/TSP patients develop antibodies to neurons . We hypothesized these antibodies would identify a central nervous system ( CNS ) autoantigen . Immunoglobulin G isolated from HAM/TSP patients identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein-A1 ( hnRNP-A1 ) as the autoantigen . Antibodies to hnRNP-A1 cross-reacted with HTLV-1-tax , the immune response to which is associated with HAM/TSP ( refs . 5,9 ) . Immunoglobulin G specifically stained human Betz cells , whose axons are preferentially damaged .

DESIGN Prospective study of patients with saphenous vein femoropopliteal bypass grafts entered into a multicentre trial . SETTING Surgical wards , outpatient clinics , and home visits coordinated by two tertiary referral centres in London and Birmingham . PATIENTS 157 Patients ( mean age 66.6 ( SD 8.2 ) years ) , 113 with patent grafts and 44 with occluded grafts one year after bypass . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Cumulative percentage patency at one year . RESULTS Markers for smoking ( blood carboxyhaemoglobin concentration ( p less than 0.05 ) and plasma thiocyanate concentration ( p less than 0.01 ) and plasma concentrations of fibrinogen ( p less than 0.001 ) and apolipoproteins AI ( p less than 0.04 ) and ( a ) ( p less than 0.05 ) were significantly higher in patients with occluded grafts . Serum cholesterol concentrations were significantly higher in patients with grafts that remained patent one year after bypass ( p less than 0.005 ) . Analysis of the smoking markers indicated that a quarter of patients ( 40 ) were untruthful in their claims to have stopped smoking . Based on smoking markers , patency of grafts in smokers was significantly lower at one year by life table analysis than in non-smokers ( 63 % v 84 % , p less than 0.02 ) . Patency was significantly higher by life table analysis in patients with a plasma fibrinogen concentration below the median than in those with a concentration above ( 90 % v 57 % , p less than 0.0002 ) . Surprisingly , increased plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was significantly associated with improved patency at one year ( 85 % ) at values above the median compared with patency ( only 68 % ) at values in the lower half of the range ( p less than 0.02 ) . CONCLUSIONS Plasma fibrinogen concentration was the most important variable predicting graft occlusion , followed by smoking markers .

DESIGN Prospective study of patients with saphenous vein femoropopliteal bypass grafts entered into a multicentre trial . SETTING Surgical wards , outpatient clinics , and home visits coordinated by two tertiary referral centres in London and Birmingham . PATIENTS 157 Patients ( mean age 66.6 ( SD 8.2 ) years ) , 113 with patent grafts and 44 with occluded grafts one year after bypass . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Cumulative percentage patency at one year . RESULTS Markers for smoking ( blood carboxyhaemoglobin concentration ( p less than 0.05 ) and plasma thiocyanate concentration ( p less than 0.01 ) and plasma concentrations of fibrinogen ( p less than 0.001 ) and apolipoproteins AI ( p less than 0.04 ) and ( a ) ( p less than 0.05 ) were significantly higher in patients with occluded grafts . Serum cholesterol concentrations were significantly higher in patients with grafts that remained patent one year after bypass ( p less than 0.005 ) . Analysis of the smoking markers indicated that a quarter of patients ( 40 ) were untruthful in their claims to have stopped smoking . Based on smoking markers , patency of grafts in smokers was significantly lower at one year by life table analysis than in non-smokers ( 63 % v 84 % , p less than 0.02 ) . Patency was significantly higher by life table analysis in patients with a plasma fibrinogen concentration below the median than in those with a concentration above ( 90 % v 57 % , p less than 0.0002 ) . Surprisingly , increased plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was significantly associated with improved patency at one year ( 85 % ) at values above the median compared with patency ( only 68 % ) at values in the lower half of the range ( p less than 0.02 ) . CONCLUSIONS Plasma fibrinogen concentration was the most important variable predicting graft occlusion , followed by smoking markers . A more forceful approach is needed to stop patients smoking ; therapeutic measures to improve patency of vein grafts should focus on decreasing plasma fibrinogen concentration rather than serum cholesterol concentration .

72,"Panic disorder is a severe anxiety disorder with recurrent , debilitating panic attacks . In individuals with panic disorder there is evidence of decreased central gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) activity as well as marked increases in autonomic and respiratory responses after intravenous infusions of hypertonic sodium lactate . In a rat model of panic disorder , chronic inhibition of GABA synthesis in the dorsomedial-perifornical hypothalamus of rats produces anxiety-like states and a similar vulnerability to sodium lactate-induced cardioexcitatory responses . The dorsomedial-perifornical hypothalamus is enriched in neurons containing orexin ( ORX , also known as hypocretin ) , which have a crucial role in arousal , vigilance and central autonomic mobilization , all of which are key components of panic . Here we show that activation of ORX-synthesizing neurons is necessary for developing a panic-prone state in the rat panic model , and either silencing of the hypothalamic gene encoding ORX ( Hcrt ) with RNAi or systemic ORX-1 receptor antagonists blocks the panic responses . Moreover , we show that human subjects with panic anxiety have elevated levels of ORX in the cerebrospinal fluid compared to subjects without panic anxiety . Taken together , our results suggest that the ORX system may be involved in the pathophysiology of panic anxiety and that ORX antagonists constitute a potential new treatment strategy for panic disorder .

73,"CONTEXT Although acute hypoglycemia may be associated with cognitive impairment in children with type 1 diabetes , no studies to date have evaluated whether hypoglycemia is a risk factor for dementia in older patients with type 2 diabetes . OBJECTIVE To determine if hypoglycemic episodes severe enough to require hospitalization are associated with an increased risk of dementia in a population of older patients with type 2 diabetes followed up for 27 years . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PATIENTS A longitudinal cohort study from 1980 - 2007 of 16,667 patients with a mean age of 65 years and type 2 diabetes who are members of an integrated health care delivery system in northern California . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Hypoglycemic events from 1980 - 2002 were collected and reviewed using hospital discharge and emergency department diagnoses . Cohort members with no prior diagnoses of dementia , mild cognitive impairment , or general memory complaints as of January 1 , 2003 , were followed up for a dementia diagnosis through January 15 , 2007 . Dementia risk was examined using Cox proportional hazard regression models , adjusted for age , sex , race/ethnicity , education , body mass index , duration of diabetes , 7-year mean glycated hemoglobin , diabetes treatment , duration of insulin use , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , cardiovascular disease , stroke , transient cerebral ischemia , and end-stage renal disease . RESULTS At least 1 episode of hypoglycemia was diagnosed in 1465 patients ( 8.8 % ) and dementia was diagnosed in 1822 patients ( 11 % ) during follow-up ; 250 patients had both dementia and at least 1 episode of hypoglycemia ( 16.95 % ) . Compared with patients with no hypoglycemia , patients with single or multiple episodes had a graded increase in risk with fully adjusted hazard ratios ( HRs ) : for 1 episode ( HR , 1.26 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.10 - 1.49 ) ; 2 episodes ( HR , 1.80 ; 95 % CI , 1.37 - 2.36 ) ; and 3 or more episodes ( HR , 1.94 ; 95 % CI , 1.42 - 2.64 ) . The attributable risk of dementia between individuals with and without a history of hypoglycemia was 2.39 % per year ( 95 % CI , 1.72%-3.01 % ) . Results were not attenuated when medical utilization rates , length of health plan membership , or time since initial diabetes diagnosis were added to the model . When examining emergency department admissions for hypoglycemia for association with risk of dementia ( 535 episodes ) , results were similar ( compared with patients with 0 episodes ) with fully adjusted HRs : for 1 episode ( HR , 1.42 ; 95 % CI , 1.12 - 1.78 ) and for 2 or more episodes ( HR , 2.36 ; 95 % CI , 1.57 - 3.55 ) . CONCLUSIONS Among older patients with type 2 diabetes , a history of severe hypoglycemic episodes was associated with a greater risk of dementia . Whether minor hypoglycemic episodes increase risk of dementia is unknown .

74,"The importance of neuropeptides in the hypothalamus has been experimentally established .

Synaptic vesicular transporters ( VGLUTs for glutamate and VGAT for GABA ) are required for vesicular uptake and , consequently , synaptic release of neurotransmitters . Ventromedial hypothalamic ( VMH ) neurons are predominantly glutamatergic and express VGLUT2 . To evaluate the role of glutamate release from VMH neurons , we generated mice lacking VGLUT2 selectively in SF1 neurons ( a major subset of VMH neurons ) . These mice have hypoglycemia during fasting secondary to impaired fasting-induced increases in the glucose-raising pancreatic hormone glucagon and impaired induction in liver of mRNAs encoding PGC-1alpha and the gluconeogenic enzymes PEPCK and G6Pase . Similarly , these mice have defective counterregulatory responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and 2-deoxyglucose ( an antimetabolite ) .

Here we show that two types of neurons from distinct brain regions showed differential permissivity to replication of several positive-stranded RNA viruses . Granule cell neurons of the cerebellum and cortical neurons from the cerebral cortex have unique innate immune programs that confer differential susceptibility to viral infection ex vivo and in vivo . By transducing cortical neurons with genes that were expressed more highly in granule cell neurons , we identified three interferon-stimulated genes ( ISGs ; Ifi27 , Irg1 and Rsad2 ( also known as Viperin ) ) that mediated the antiviral effects against different neurotropic viruses .

Additionally , regulatory T ( T(reg ) ) cells comprise a high proportion ( 30 - 40 % ) of CD4(+ ) T cells in pediatric tissues but are present at much lower frequencies ( 1 - 10 % ) in adult tissues . Pediatric tissue T(reg ) cells suppress endogenous T cell activation , and early T cell functionality is confined to the mucosal sites that have the lowest T(reg):T(EM ) cell ratios , which suggests control in situ of immune responses in early life .

77,"Leukemias and other cancers possess self-renewing stem cells that help to maintain the cancer . Cancer stem cell eradication is thought to be crucial for successful anticancer therapy . Using an acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) model induced by the leukemia-associated monocytic leukemia zinc finger (MOZ)-TIF2 fusion protein , we show here that AML can be cured by the ablation of leukemia stem cells . The MOZ fusion proteins MOZ-TIF2 and MOZ-CBP interacted with the transcription factor PU.1 to stimulate the expression of macrophage colony – stimulating factor receptor ( CSF1R , also known as M-CSFR , c-FMS or CD115 ) . Studies using PU.1-deficient mice showed that PU.1 is essential for the ability of MOZ-TIF2 to establish and maintain AML stem cells . Cells expressing high amounts of CSF1R ( CSF1Rhigh cells ) , but not those expressing low amounts of CSF1R ( CSF1Rlow cells ) , showed potent leukemia-initiating activity . Using transgenic mice expressing a drug-inducible suicide gene controlled by the CSF1R promoter , we cured AML by ablation of CSF1Rhigh cells . Moreover , induction of AML was suppressed in CSF1R-deficient mice and CSF1R inhibitors slowed the progression of MOZ-TIF2–induced leukemia . Thus , in this subtype of AML , leukemia stem cells are contained within the CSF1Rhigh cell population , and we suggest that targeting of PU.1-mediated upregulation of CSF1R expression might be a useful therapeutic approach .

78,"CONTEXT More than 1.5 million US adults use stimulants and other medications labeled for treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) . These agents can increase heart rate and blood pressure , raising concerns about their cardiovascular safety . OBJECTIVE To examine whether current use of medications prescribed primarily to treat ADHD is associated with increased risk of serious cardiovascular events in young and middle-aged adults . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective , population-based cohort study using electronic health care records from 4 study sites ( OptumInsight Epidemiology , Tennessee Medicaid , Kaiser Permanente California , and the HMO Research Network ) , starting in 1986 at 1 site and ending in 2005 at all sites , with additional covariate assessment using 2007 survey data . Participants were adults aged 25 through 64 years with dispensed prescriptions for methylphenidate , amphetamine , or atomoxetine at baseline . Each medication user ( n = 150,359 ) was matched to 2 nonusers on study site , birth year , sex , and calendar year ( 443,198 total users and nonusers ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Serious cardiovascular events , including myocardial infarction ( MI ) , sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) , or stroke , with comparison between current or new users and remote users to account for potential healthy-user bias . RESULTS During 806,182 person-years of follow-up ( median , 1.3 years per person ) , 1357 cases of MI , 296 cases of SCD , and 575 cases of stroke occurred . There were 107,322 person-years of current use ( median , 0.33 years ) , with a crude incidence per 1000 person-years of 1.34 ( 95 % CI , 1.14 - 1.57 ) for MI , 0.30 ( 95 % CI , 0.20 - 0.42 ) for SCD , and 0.56 ( 95 % CI , 0.43 - 0.72 ) for stroke . The multivariable-adjusted rate ratio ( RR ) of serious cardiovascular events for current use vs nonuse of ADHD medications was 0.83 ( 95 % CI , 0.72 - 0.96 ) . Among new users of ADHD medications , the adjusted RR was 0.77 ( 95 % CI , 0.63 - 0.94 ) . The adjusted RR for current use vs remote use was 1.03 ( 95 % CI , 0.86 - 1.24 ) ; for new use vs remote use , the adjusted RR was 1.02 ( 95 % CI , 0.82 - 1.28 ) ; the upper limit of 1.28 corresponds to an additional 0.19 events per 1000 person-years at ages 25 - 44 years and 0.77 events per 1000 person-years at ages 45 - 64 years . CONCLUSIONS Among young and middle-aged adults , current or new use of ADHD medications , compared with nonuse or remote use , was not associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events . Apparent protective associations likely represent healthy-user bias .

79,"CONTEXT The epidemic of heart failure has yet to be fully investigated , and data on incidence , survival , and sex-specific temporal trends in community-based populations are limited . OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that the incidence of heart failure has declined and survival after heart failure diagnosis has improved over time but that secular trends have diverged by sex . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Population-based cohort study using the resources of the Rochester Epidemiology Project conducted in Olmsted County , Minnesota . Patients were 4537 Olmsted County residents ( 57 % women ; mean [ SD ] age , 74 [ 14 ] years ) with a diagnosis of heart failure between 1979 and 2000 . Framingham criteria and clinical criteria were used to validate the diagnosis MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Incidence of heart failure and survival after heart failure diagnosis . RESULTS The incidence of heart failure was higher among men ( 378/100 000 persons ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 361 - 395 for men ; 289/100 000 persons ; 95 % CI , 277 - 300 for women ) and did not change over time among men or women .

80,"The number of women dying from cervical cancer in 1997 was 7 % lower than in 1996 and has fallen by over 25 % since 1992.1 Such rapid change must be at least partly due to cervical screening , although strong cohort effects have caused large fluctuations in cervical mortality in the past.2 We modelled mortality data , taking into account the effects of age and year of birth and looking for trends in time within four age groups to estimate the beneficial effects of cervical screening . We obtained mortality data , in 5 year age bands , from death registrations in England and Wales and calculated rates using mid-year population estimates . Mortality since 1993 was adjusted upwards by 4 % because of changes in classification of cause of death.3 We modelled the data assuming that the age specific mortality is the product of a smoothly varying age effect , birth cohort effect , and age dependent … With respect to cervical cancer management , Finland and the Netherlands are comparable in relevant characteristics , e.g. , fertility rate , age-of-mother at first birth and a national screening programme for several years . The aim of this study is to compare trends in incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer in Finland and the Netherlands in relation to the introduction and intensity of the screening programmes . Therefore , incidence and mortality rates were calculated using the Cancer Registries of Finland and the Netherlands . Data on screening intensity were obtained from the Finnish Cancer Registry and the Dutch evaluation centre at ErasmusMC-Rotterdam . Women aged 30 - 60 have been screened every 5 years , in Finland since 1992 and in the Netherlands since 1996 . Screening protocols for smear taking and referral to the gynaecologist are comparable . Incidence and mortality rates have declined more in Finland . In 2003 , age-adjusted incidence and mortality in Finland were 4.0 and 0.9 and in the Netherlands 4.9 and 1.4 per 100,000 woman-years , respectively . Excess smear use in the Netherlands was estimated to be 24 per 1,000 women during a 5-year interval compared to 121 in Finland . The decline in mortality in Finland seems to be almost completely related to the screening programme whereas in the Netherlands it was initially considered to be a natural decline . Differences in risk factors might also play a role : the Netherlands has higher population density and higher percentages of immigrants and ( female ) smokers . The greater excess smear use in Finland might also have affected incidence . OBJECTIVE To describe the efficacy of the Finnish mass screening program for cervical squamous carcinoma and adenocarcinoma , as reflected by changes of incidence and mortality rate . METHODS Cervical cancer incidence and mortality data were obtained from the Finnish Cancer Registry . Data were available from the year 1953 , when the registry was established . The nationwide mass screening program in Finland was started in the mid-1960s . A centralized organization administers this program . Women age 30 - 60 years are notified for screening every 5 years . RESULTS The mean incidence of cervical carcinoma in the early 1960s was 15.4 per 10(5 ) woman-years . In 1991 , it was only 2.7 per 10(5 ) woman-years . The mortality rate has decreased in the same proportion since the mass screening program . In the early 1960s , the mortality was 6.6 and in 1991 1.4 per 10(5 ) woman-years . However , the decrease of the incidence is seen almost exclusively in squamous cell carcinomas . The mortality caused by adenocarcinoma has decreased in screened birth cohorts , but the incidence rate has remained the same .

81,"With respect to cervical cancer management , Finland and the Netherlands are comparable in relevant characteristics , e.g. , fertility rate , age-of-mother at first birth and a national screening programme for several years . The aim of this study is to compare trends in incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer in Finland and the Netherlands in relation to the introduction and intensity of the screening programmes . Therefore , incidence and mortality rates were calculated using the Cancer Registries of Finland and the Netherlands . Data on screening intensity were obtained from the Finnish Cancer Registry and the Dutch evaluation centre at ErasmusMC-Rotterdam . Women aged 30 - 60 have been screened every 5 years , in Finland since 1992 and in the Netherlands since 1996 . Screening protocols for smear taking and referral to the gynaecologist are comparable . Incidence and mortality rates have declined more in Finland . In 2003 , age-adjusted incidence and mortality in Finland were 4.0 and 0.9 and in the Netherlands 4.9 and 1.4 per 100,000 woman-years , respectively . Excess smear use in the Netherlands was estimated to be 24 per 1,000 women during a 5-year interval compared to 121 in Finland . The decline in mortality in Finland seems to be almost completely related to the screening programme whereas in the Netherlands it was initially considered to be a natural decline . Differences in risk factors might also play a role : the Netherlands has higher population density and higher percentages of immigrants and ( female ) smokers . The greater excess smear use in Finland might also have affected incidence .

82,"Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ( LRRK2 ) mutations are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson 's disease . LRRK2 is a multifunctional protein affecting many cellular processes and has been described to bind microtubules . Defective microtubule-based axonal transport is hypothesized to contribute to Parkinson 's disease , but whether LRRK2 mutations affect this process to mediate pathogenesis is not known . Here we find that LRRK2 containing pathogenic Roc-COR domain mutations ( R1441C , Y1699C ) preferentially associates with deacetylated microtubules , and inhibits axonal transport in primary neurons and in Drosophila , causing locomotor deficits in vivo . In vitro , increasing microtubule acetylation using deacetylase inhibitors or the tubulin acetylase αTAT1 prevents association of mutant LRRK2 with microtubules , and the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A ( TSA ) restores axonal transport . In vivo knockdown of the deacetylases HDAC6 and Sirt2 , or administration of TSA rescues both axonal transport and locomotor behavior .

We tested whether the delivery and efficacy of gemcitabine in the mice could be improved by coadministration of IPI-926 , a drug that depletes tumor-associated stromal tissue by inhibition of the Hedgehog cellular signaling pathway . The combination therapy produced a transient increase in intratumoral vascular density and intratumoral concentration of gemcitabine , leading to transient stabilization of disease .

84,"The PI3 K signaling pathway regulates cell growth and movement and is heavily mutated in cancer . Class I PI3Ks synthesize the lipid messenger PI(3,4,5)P3 . PI(3,4,5)P3 can be dephosphorylated by 3- or 5-phosphatases , the latter producing PI(3,4)P2 . The PTEN tumor suppressor is thought to function primarily as a PI(3,4,5)P3 3-phosphatase , limiting activation of this pathway . Here we show that PTEN also functions as a PI(3,4)P2 3-phosphatase , both in vitro and in vivo . PTEN is a major PI(3,4)P2 phosphatase in Mcf10a cytosol , and loss of PTEN and INPP4B , a known PI(3,4)P2 4-phosphatase , leads to synergistic accumulation of PI(3,4)P2 , which correlated with increased invadopodia in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated cells . PTEN deletion increased PI(3,4)P2 levels in a mouse model of prostate cancer , and it inversely correlated with PI(3,4)P2 levels across several EGF-stimulated prostate and breast cancer lines . These results point to a role for PI(3,4)P2 in the phenotype caused by loss-of-function mutations or deletions in PTEN .

85,"CONTEXT Insomnia is a common condition in older adults and is associated with a number of adverse medical , social , and psychological consequences . Previous research has suggested beneficial outcomes of both psychological and pharmacological treatments , but blinded placebo-controlled trials comparing the effects of these treatments are lacking . OBJECTIVE To examine short- and long-term clinical efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) and pharmacological treatment in older adults experiencing chronic primary insomnia . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial of 46 adults ( mean age , 60.8 y ; 22 women ) with chronic primary insomnia conducted between January 2004 and December 2005 in a single Norwegian university-based outpatient clinic for adults and elderly patients . INTERVENTION CBT ( sleep hygiene , sleep restriction , stimulus control , cognitive therapy , and relaxation ; n = 18 ) , sleep medication ( 7.5-mg zopiclone each night ; n = 16 ) , or placebo medication ( n = 12 ) . All treatment duration was 6 weeks , and the 2 active treatments were followed up at 6 months . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Ambulant clinical polysomnographic data and sleep diaries were used to determine total wake time , total sleep time , sleep efficiency , and slow-wave sleep ( only assessed using polysomnography ) on all 3 assessment points . RESULTS CBT resulted in improved short- and long-term outcomes compared with zopiclone on 3 out of 4 outcome measures . For most outcomes , zopiclone did not differ from placebo . Participants receiving CBT improved their sleep efficiency from 81.4 % at pretreatment to 90.1 % at 6-month follow-up compared with a decrease from 82.3 % to 81.9 % in the zopiclone group . Participants in the CBT group spent much more time in slow-wave sleep ( stages 3 and 4 ) compared with those in other groups , and spent less time awake during the night . Total sleep time was similar in all 3 groups ; at 6 months , patients receiving CBT had better sleep efficiency using polysomnography than those taking zopiclone . CONCLUSION These results suggest that interventions based on CBT are superior to zopiclone treatment both in short- and long-term management of insomnia in older adults .

86,"BACKGROUND LDL cholesterol has a causal role in the development of cardiovascular disease . Improved understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie the metabolism and regulation of LDL cholesterol might help to identify novel therapeutic targets . We therefore did a genome-wide association study of LDL-cholesterol concentrations . METHODS We used genome-wide association data from up to 11,685 participants with measures of circulating LDL-cholesterol concentrations across five studies , including data for 293 461 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) with a minor allele frequency of 5 % or more that passed our quality control criteria . We also used data from a second genome-wide array in up to 4337 participants from three of these five studies , with data for 290,140 SNPs . We did replication studies in two independent populations consisting of up to 4979 participants . Statistical approaches , including meta-analysis and linkage disequilibrium plots , were used to refine association signals ; we analysed pooled data from all seven populations to determine the effect of each SNP on variations in circulating LDL-cholesterol concentrations . FINDINGS In our initial scan , we found two SNPs ( rs599839 [ p=1.7x10(-15 ) ] and rs4970834 [ p=3.0x10(-11 ) ] ) that showed genome-wide statistical association with LDL cholesterol at chromosomal locus 1p13.3 . The second genome screen found a third statistically associated SNP at the same locus ( rs646776 [ p=4.3x10(-9 ) ] ) . Meta-analysis of data from all studies showed an association of SNPs rs599839 ( combined p=1.2x10(-33 ) ) and rs646776 ( p=4.8x10(-20 ) ) with LDL-cholesterol concentrations . SNPs rs599839 and rs646776 both explained around 1 % of the variation in circulating LDL-cholesterol concentrations and were associated with about 15 % of an SD change in LDL cholesterol per allele , assuming an SD of 1 mmol/L.

Thus , by preventing nutritional consumption of extracellular proteins , mTORC1 couples growth to availability of free amino acids .

98,"BACKGROUND Artemisinin derivatives used in recently introduced combination therapies ( ACTs ) for Plasmodium falciparum malaria significantly lower patient infectiousness and have the potential to reduce population-level transmission of the parasite . With the increased interest in malaria elimination , understanding the impact on transmission of ACT and other antimalarial drugs with different pharmacodynamics becomes a key issue . This study estimates the reduction in transmission that may be achieved by introducing different types of treatment for symptomatic P. falciparum malaria in endemic areas . METHODS AND FINDINGS We developed a mathematical model to predict the potential impact on transmission outcomes of introducing ACT as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in six areas of varying transmission intensity in Tanzania . We also estimated the impact that could be achieved by antimalarials with different efficacy , prophylactic time , and gametocytocidal effects . Rates of treatment , asymptomatic infection , and symptomatic infection in the six study areas were estimated using the model together with data from a cross-sectional survey of 5,667 individuals conducted prior to policy change from sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine to ACT . The effects of ACT and other drug types on gametocytaemia and infectiousness to mosquitoes were independently estimated from clinical trial data . Predicted percentage reductions in prevalence of infection and incidence of clinical episodes achieved by ACT were highest in the areas with low initial transmission . A 53 % reduction in prevalence of infection was seen if 100 % of current treatment was switched to ACT in the area where baseline slide-prevalence of parasitaemia was lowest ( 3.7 % ) , compared to an 11 % reduction in the highest-transmission setting ( baseline slide prevalence = 57.1 % ) . Estimated percentage reductions in incidence of clinical episodes were similar . The absolute size of the public health impact , however , was greater in the highest-transmission area , with 54 clinical episodes per 100 persons per year averted compared to five per 100 persons per year in the lowest-transmission area . High coverage was important . Reducing presumptive treatment through improved diagnosis substantially reduced the number of treatment courses required per clinical episode averted in the lower-transmission settings although there was some loss of overall impact on transmission . An efficacious antimalarial regimen with no specific gametocytocidal properties but a long prophylactic time was estimated to be more effective at reducing transmission than a short-acting ACT in the highest-transmission setting . CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that ACTs have the potential for transmission reductions approaching those achieved by insecticide-treated nets in lower-transmission settings . ACT partner drugs and nonartemisinin regimens with longer prophylactic times could result in a larger impact in higher-transmission settings , although their long term benefit must be evaluated in relation to the risk of development of parasite resistance .

99,"BACKGROUND Elderly and frail patients with cancer , although often treated with chemotherapy , are under-represented in clinical trials . We designed FOCUS2 to investigate reduced-dose chemotherapy options and to seek objective predictors of outcome in frail patients with advanced colorectal cancer . METHODS We undertook an open , 2 × 2 factorial trial in 61 UK centres for patients with previously untreated advanced colorectal cancer who were considered unfit for full-dose chemotherapy . After comprehensive health assessment ( CHA ) , patients were randomly assigned by minimisation to : 48-h intravenous fluorouracil with levofolinate ( group A ) ; oxaliplatin and fluorouracil ( group B ) ; capecitabine ( group C ) ; or oxaliplatin and capecitabine ( group D ) . Treatment allocation was not masked . Starting doses were 80 % of standard doses , with discretionary escalation to full dose after 6 weeks . The two primary outcome measures were : addition of oxaliplatin ( [ A vs B ] + [ C vs D ] ) , assessed with progression-free survival ( PFS ) ; and substitution of fluorouracil with capecitabine ( [ A vs C ] + [ B vs D ] ) , assessed by change from baseline to 12 weeks in global quality of life ( QoL ) . Analysis was by intention to treat . Baseline clinical and CHA data were modelled against outcomes with a novel composite measure , overall treatment utility ( OTU ) . This study is registered , number ISRCTN21221452 . FINDINGS 459 patients were randomly assigned ( 115 to each of groups A-C , 114 to group D ) . Factorial comparison of addition of oxaliplatin versus no addition suggested some improvement in PFS , but the finding was not significant ( median 5·8 months [ IQR 3·3 - 7·5 ] vs 4·5 months [ 2·8 - 6·4 ] ; hazard ratio 0·84 , 95 % CI 0·69 - 1·01 , p=0·07 ) . Replacement of fluorouracil with capecitabine did not improve global QoL : 69 of 124 ( 56 % ) patients receiving fluorouracil reported improvement in global QoL compared with 69 of 123 ( 56 % ) receiving capecitabine . The risk of having any grade 3 or worse toxic effect was not significantly increased with oxaliplatin ( 83/219 [ 38 % ] vs 70/221 [ 32 % ] ; p=0·17 ) , but was higher with capecitabine than with fluorouracil ( 88/222 [ 40 % ] vs 65/218 [ 30 % ] ; p=0·03 ) . In multivariable analysis , fewer baseline symptoms ( odds ratio 1·32 , 95 % CI 1·14 - 1·52 ) , less widespread disease ( 1·51 , 1·05 - 2·19 ) , and use of oxaliplatin ( 0·57 , 0·39 - 0·82 ) were predictive of better OTU . INTERPRETATION FOCUS2 shows that with an appropriate design , including reduced starting doses of chemotherapy , frail and elderly patients can participate in a randomised controlled trial . On balance , a combination including oxaliplatin was preferable to single-agent fluoropyrimidines , although the primary endpoint of PFS was not met .

Little is known about its role in inflammatory heart disease . METHODS AND RESULTS We showed that IFN-gamma receptor-deficient mice ( IFN-gammaR(-/- ) ) on a BALB/c background immunized with a peptide derived from cardiac alpha-myosin heavy chain develop severe myocarditis with high mortality . Although myocarditis subsided in wild-type mice after 3 weeks , IFN-gammaR(-/- ) mice showed persistent disease . The persistent inflammation was accompanied by vigorous in vitro CD4 T-cell responses and impaired inducible nitric oxide synthase expression , together with evidence of impaired nitric oxide production in IFN-gammaR(-/- ) hearts . Treatment of wild-type mice with the nitric oxide synthetase inhibitor N:-nitro-l-arginine-methyl-ester enhanced in vitro CD4 T-cell proliferation and prevented healing of myocarditis .

105,"The only proven requirement for ascorbic acid ( vitamin C ) is in preventing scurvy , presumably because it is a cofactor for hydroxylases required for post-translational modifications that stabilize collagen .

Cultured embryonic fibroblasts from homozygous Slc23a1−/− mice had less than 5 % of normal ascorbic-acid uptake . Ascorbic-acid levels were undetectable or markedly reduced in the blood and tissues of Slc23a1−/− mice .

106,"Background The catalytically active 66-kDa subunit of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) reverse transcriptase ( RT ) consists of DNA polymerase , connection , and ribonuclease H ( RNase H ) domains . Almost all known RT inhibitor resistance mutations identified to date map to the polymerase domain of the enzyme . However , the connection and RNase H domains are not routinely analysed in clinical samples and none of the genotyping assays available for patient management sequence the entire RT coding region . The British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS ( the Centre ) genotypes clinical isolates up to codon 400 in RT , and our retrospective statistical analyses of the Centre ’s database have identified an N348I mutation in the RT connection domain in treatment-experienced individuals . The objective of this multidisciplinary study was to establish the in vivo relevance of this mutation and its role in drug resistance . Methods and Findings The prevalence of N348I in clinical isolates , the time taken for it to emerge under selective drug pressure , and its association with changes in viral load , specific drug treatment , and known drug resistance mutations was analysed from genotypes , viral loads , and treatment histories from the Centre ’s database . N348I increased in prevalence from below 1 % in 368 treatmentnao ¨ve individuals to 12.1 % in 1,009 treatment-experienced patients ( p ¼ 7.7 3 10 � 12 ) . N348I appeared early in therapy and was highly associated with thymidine analogue mutations ( TAMs ) M41L and T215Y/F ( p , 0.001 ) , the lamivudine resistance mutations M184V/I ( p , 0.001 ) , and non-nucleoside RTI ( NNRTI ) resistance mutations K103N and Y181C/I ( p , 0.001 ) . The association with TAMs and NNRTI resistance mutations was consistent with the selection of N348I in patients treated with regimens that included both zidovudine and nevirapine ( odds ratio 2.62 , 95 % confidence interval 1.43–4.81 ) . The appearance of N348I was associated with a significant increase in viral load ( p , 0.001 ) , which was as large as the viral load increases observed for any of the TAMs . However , this analysis did not account for the simultaneous selection of other RT or protease inhibitor resistance mutations on viral load . To delineate the role of this mutation in RT inhibitor resistance , N348I was introduced into HIV-1 molecular clones containing different genetic backbones . N348I decreased zidovudine susceptibility 2- to 4-fold in the context of wildtype HIV-1 or when combined with TAMs .

112,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the cost effectiveness of standard treatment with and without the addition of ward based non-invasive ventilation in patients admitted to hospital with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . DESIGN Incremental cost effectiveness analysis of a randomised controlled trial . SETTING Medical wards in 14 hospitals in the United Kingdom . PARTICIPANTS The trial comprised 236 patients admitted to hospital with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and mild to moderate acidosis ( pH 7.25 - 7.35 ) secondary to respiratory failure . The economic analysis compared the costs of treatment that these patients received after randomisation . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Incremental cost per in-hospital death . RESULTS 24/118 died in the group receiving standard treatment and 12/118 in the group receiving non-invasive ventilation ( P=0.05 ) . Allocation to the group receiving non-invasive ventilation was associated with a reduction in costs of 49362 pounds sterling ( 78741 dollars ; 73109 euros ) , mainly through reduced use of intensive care units . The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was -645 pounds sterling per death avoided ( 95 % confidence interval -2310 pounds sterling to 386 pounds sterling ) , indicating a dominant ( more effective and less costly ) strategy . Modelling of these data indicates that a typical UK hospital providing a non-invasive ventilation service will avoid six deaths and three to nine admissions to intensive care units per year , with an associated cost reduction of 12000 - 53000 pounds sterling per year .

The adoptees represented four groups who by sampling from a larger population were categorised as either thin , medium weight , overweight , or obese . Weight and height were obtained for 115 full siblings of 57 adoptees and for 850 half siblings of 341 adoptees .

Body mass index of the half siblings showed a steady but weaker increase across the four weight groups of adoptees .

In contrast with the findings in half siblings and ( previously ) the natural parents there was a striking , significant increase in body mass index between full siblings of overweight and obese adoptees .

Several tests were applied in order to examine the genetic contribution to obesity , and in particular to investigate the presence of a dominant major gene . Our conclusions are that genetic factors are certainly present . Several analyses suggest the presence of a dominant major gene with weak effect . Using the Princeton School District Family Study cohort , our specific aim was to estimate the prevalence of suspected familial ponderosity and leanness , to provide empirical risk estimates for the proportion of probands ' first-degree relatives who were similarly affected , and to estimate the contributions of diseases , drugs and caloric intake to relative obesity and leanness . We studied 379 probands , 125 whites and 52 blacks from a random recall group , 147 whites and 55 blacks from a hyperlipidemic recall group . Suspected familial obesity and leanness were arbitrarily identified in those kindreds with at least two first-degree relatives in the same Quetelet index decile as the proband , top or bottom respectively . Suspected familial obesity was observed in 2.4 percent and 6 percent respectively of random and hyperlipidemic recall group whites . Suspected familial leanness was identified in 2.4 percent and 1.4 percent of random and hyperlipidemic recall whites and in 3.8 percent of randomly recalled blacks . Approximately twice as many as expected white first-degree relatives of top Quetelet index decile probands themselves had top decile Quetelet indices ; approximately three times as many as expected first-degree relatives of bottom decile Quetelet index probands themselves had bottom decile Quetelet indices . Nineteen percent and 31 percent of top decile Quetelet index white probands from random and hyperlipidemic recall groups came from families where at least two other first-degree relatives were similarly obese ; 18 percent and 20 percent of white random and hyperlipidemic recall group probands with bottom decile Quetelet indices had suspected familial leanness . Nearly all subjects with familial obesity or leanness had no overt metabolic or pharmacological explanations for their body habitus . Within-family clustering of hypertension was common in kindreds with suspected familial obesity and was absent in kindreds with suspected familial leanness . Marked within-family clustering of both obesity and leanness is useful diagnostically ; therapeutic intervention to reduce obesity , to be most effective , should be family-wide in the many kindreds which share familial obesity . To assess the relative importance of genetic and environmental effects on the body-mass index ( weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters ) , we studied samples of identical and fraternal twins , reared apart or reared together . The samples consisted of 93 pairs of identical twins reared apart , 154 pairs of identical twins reared together , 218 pairs of fraternal twins reared apart , and 208 pairs of fraternal twins reared together . The intrapair correlation coefficients of the values for body-mass index of identical twins reared apart were 0.70 for men and 0.66 for women . These are the most direct estimates of the relative importance of genetic influences ( heritability ) on the body-mass index , and they were only slightly lower than those for twins reared together in this and earlier studies . Similar estimates were derived from maximum-likelihood model-fitting analyses--0.74 for men and 0.69 for women . Nonadditive genetic variance made a significant contribution to the estimates of heritability , particularly among men . Of the potential environmental influences , only those unique to the individual and not those shared by family members were important , contributing about 30 percent of the variance . Sharing the same childhood environment did not contribute to the similarity of the body-mass index of twins later in life . We conclude that genetic influences on body-mass index are substantial , whereas the childhood environment has little or no influence . These findings corroborate and extend the results of earlier studies of twins and adoptees . We examined the contributions of genetic factors and the family environment to human fatness in a sample of 540 adult Danish adoptees who were selected from a population of 3580 and divided into four weight classes : thin , median weight , overweight , and obese . There was a strong relation between the weight class of the adoptees and the body-mass index of their biologic parents - for the mothers , P less than 0.0001 ; for the fathers , P less than 0.02 . There was no relation between the weight class of the adoptees and the body-mass index of their adoptive parents . Cumulative distributions of the body-mass index of parents showed similar results ; there was a strong relation between the body-mass index of biologic parents and adoptee weight class and no relation between the index of adoptive parents and adoptee weight class . Furthermore , the relation between biologic parents and adoptees was not confined to the obesity weight class , but was present across the whole range of body fatness - from very thin to very fat . We conclude that genetic influences have an important role in determining human fatness in adults , whereas the family environment alone has no apparent effect .

117,"Intestinal microbiota metabolism of choline and phosphatidylcholine produces trimethylamine ( TMA ) , which is further metabolized to a proatherogenic species , trimethylamine-N-oxide ( TMAO ) . We demonstrate here that metabolism by intestinal microbiota of dietary L-carnitine , a trimethylamine abundant in red meat , also produces TMAO and accelerates atherosclerosis in mice . Omnivorous human subjects produced more TMAO than did vegans or vegetarians following ingestion of L-carnitine through a microbiota-dependent mechanism . The presence of specific bacterial taxa in human feces was associated with both plasma TMAO concentration and dietary status . Plasma L-carnitine levels in subjects undergoing cardiac evaluation ( n = 2,595 ) predicted increased risks for both prevalent cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) and incident major adverse cardiac events ( myocardial infarction , stroke or death ) , but only among subjects with concurrently high TMAO levels . Chronic dietary L-carnitine supplementation in mice altered cecal microbial composition , markedly enhanced synthesis of TMA and TMAO , and increased atherosclerosis , but this did not occur if intestinal microbiota was concurrently suppressed . In mice with an intact intestinal microbiota , dietary supplementation with TMAO or either carnitine or choline reduced in vivo reverse cholesterol transport .

Here , we describe a role for CLEC-2 in the morphodynamic behavior and motility of DCs . CLEC-2 deficiency in DCs impaired their entry into lymphatics and trafficking to and within lymph nodes , thereby reducing T cell priming . CLEC-2 engagement of PDPN was necessary for DCs to spread and migrate along stromal surfaces and sufficient to induce membrane protrusions . CLEC-2 activation triggered cell spreading via downregulation of RhoA activity and myosin light-chain phosphorylation and triggered F-actin-rich protrusions via Vav signaling and Rac1 activation . Thus , activation of CLEC-2 by PDPN rearranges the actin cytoskeleton in DCs to promote efficient motility along stromal surfaces .

120,"Synaptic long-term potentiation ( LTP ) at spinal neurons directly communicating pain-specific inputs from the periphery to the brain has been proposed to serve as a trigger for pain hypersensitivity in pathological states . Previous studies have functionally implicated the NMDA receptor-NO pathway and the downstream second messenger , cGMP , in these processes . Because cGMP can broadly influence diverse ion-channels , kinases , and phosphodiesterases , pre- as well as post-synaptically , the precise identity of cGMP targets mediating spinal LTP , their mechanisms of action , and their locus in the spinal circuitry are still unclear . Here , we found that Protein Kinase G1 ( PKG-I ) localized presynaptically in nociceptor terminals plays an essential role in the expression of spinal LTP . Using the Cre-lox P system , we generated nociceptor-specific knockout mice lacking PKG-I specifically in presynaptic terminals of nociceptors in the spinal cord , but not in post-synaptic neurons or elsewhere ( SNS-PKG-I(-/- ) mice ) . Patch clamp recordings showed that activity-induced LTP at identified synapses between nociceptors and spinal neurons projecting to the periaqueductal grey ( PAG ) was completely abolished in SNS-PKG-I(-/- ) mice , although basal synaptic transmission was not affected . Analyses of synaptic failure rates and paired-pulse ratios indicated a role for presynaptic PKG-I in regulating the probability of neurotransmitter release . Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor 1 and myosin light chain kinase were recruited as key phosphorylation targets of presynaptic PKG-I in nociceptive neurons . Finally , behavioural analyses in vivo showed marked defects in SNS-PKG-I(-/- ) mice in several models of activity-induced nociceptive hypersensitivity , and pharmacological studies identified a clear contribution of PKG-I expressed in spinal terminals of nociceptors . Our results thus indicate that presynaptic mechanisms involving an increase in release probability from nociceptors are operational in the expression of synaptic LTP on spinal-PAG projection neurons and that PKG-I localized in presynaptic nociceptor terminals plays an essential role in this process to regulate pain sensitivity .

OBJECTIVE To determine whether physical activity reduces the rate of cognitive decline among older adults at risk . DESIGN AND SETTING Randomized controlled trial of a 24-week physical activity intervention conducted between 2004 and 2007 in metropolitan Perth , Western Australia . Assessors of cognitive function were blinded to group membership . PARTICIPANTS We recruited volunteers who reported memory problems but did not meet criteria for dementia . Three hundred eleven individuals aged 50 years or older were screened for eligibility , 89 were not eligible , and 52 refused to participate . A total of 170 participants were randomized and 138 participants completed the 18-month assessment . INTERVENTION Participants were randomly allocated to an education and usual care group or to a 24-week home-based program of physical activity . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Change in Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale ( ADAS-Cog ) scores ( possible range , 0 - 70 ) over 18 months . RESULTS In an intent-to-treat analysis , participants in the intervention group improved 0.26 points ( 95 % confidence interval , -0.89 to 0.54 ) and those in the usual care group deteriorated 1.04 points ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.32 to 1.82 ) on the ADAS-Cog at the end of the intervention . The absolute difference of the outcome measure between the intervention and control groups was -1.3 points ( 95 % confidence interval,-2.38 to -0.22 ) at the end of the intervention . At 18 months , participants in the intervention group improved 0.73 points ( 95 % confidence interval , -1.27 to 0.03 ) on the ADAS-Cog , and those in the usual care group improved 0.04 points ( 95 % confidence interval , -0.46 to 0.88 ) .

PARTICIPANTS The 3736 patients in the cohort who started HAART before 2002 ( median age 36 years , 29 % female , median follow up 3.6 years ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Time to AIDS or death ( primary endpoint ) , death alone , increases in CD4 cell count of at least 50 and 100 above baseline , optimal viral suppression ( a viral load below 400 copies/ml ) , and viral rebound . RESULTS During follow up 2985 ( 80 % ) participants reported a stable partnership on at least one occasion . When starting HAART , 52 % ( 545/1042 ) of participants reported a stable partnership ; after five years of follow up 46 % ( 190/412 ) of participants reported a stable partnership . In an analysis stratified by previous antiretroviral therapy and clinical stage when starting HAART ( US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention group A , B , or C ) , the adjusted hazard ratio for progression to AIDS or death was 0.79 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.63 to 0.98 ) for participants with a stable partnership compared with those without . Adjusted hazards ratios for other endpoints were 0.59 ( 0.44 to 0.79 ) for progression to death , 1.15 ( 1.06 to 1.24 ) for an increase in CD4 cells of 100 counts/microl or more , and 1.06 ( 0.98 to 1.14 ) for optimal viral suppression .

123,"Antigen-specific CD8 + T-cell tolerance , induced by myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs ) , is one of the main mechanisms of tumor escape . Using in vivo models , we show here that MDSCs directly disrupt the binding of specific peptide – major histocompatibility complex ( pMHC ) dimers to CD8-expressing T cells through nitration of tyrosines in a T-cell receptor (TCR)-CD8 complex . This process makes CD8-expressing T cells unable to bind pMHC and to respond to the specific peptide , although they retain their ability to respond to nonspecific stimulation . Nitration of TCR-CD8 is induced by MDSCs through hyperproduction of reactive oxygen species and peroxynitrite during direct cell-cell contact . Molecular modeling suggests specific sites of nitration that might affect the conformational flexibility of TCR-CD8 and its interaction with pMHC .

125,"OBJECTIVE Although the Polypill concept ( proposed in 2003 ) is promising in terms of benefits for cardiovascular risk management , the potential costs and adverse effects are its main pitfalls . The objective of this study was to identify a tastier and safer alternative to the Polypill : the Polymeal . METHODS Data on the ingredients of the Polymeal were taken from the literature . The evidence based recipe included wine , fish , dark chocolate , fruits , vegetables , garlic , and almonds . Data from the Framingham heart study and the Framingham offspring study were used to build life tables to model the benefits of the Polymeal in the general population from age 50 , assuming multiplicative correlations . RESULTS Combining the ingredients of the Polymeal would reduce cardiovascular disease events by 76 % . For men , taking the Polymeal daily represented an increase in total life expectancy of 6.6 years , an increase in life expectancy free from cardiovascular disease of 9.0 years , and a decrease in life expectancy with cardiovascular disease of 2.4 years .

126,"Recent studies have investigated the dendritic actin cytoskeleton of the cell edge 's lamellipodial ( LP ) region by experimentally decreasing the activity of the actin filament nucleator and branch former , the Arp2/3 complex . Here we extend these studies via pharmacological inhibition of the Arp2/3 complex in sea urchin coelomocytes , cells that possess an unusually broad LP region and display correspondingly exaggerated centripetal flow . Using light and electron microscopy , we demonstrate that Arp2/3 complex inhibition via the drug CK666 dramatically altered LP actin architecture , slowed centripetal flow , drove a lamellipodial-to-filopodial shape change in suspended cells , and induced a novel actin structural organization during cell spreading . A general feature of the CK666 phenotype in coelomocytes was transverse actin arcs , and arc generation was arrested by a formin inhibitor . We also demonstrate that CK666 treatment produces actin arcs in other cells with broad LP regions , namely fish keratocytes and Drosophila S2 cells . We hypothesize that the actin arcs made visible by Arp2/3 complex inhibition in coelomocytes may represent an exaggerated manifestation of the elongate mother filaments that could possibly serve as the scaffold for the production of the dendritic actin network .

127,"BACKGROUND Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) testing is more sensitive for the detection of high-grade cervical lesions than is cytology , but detection of HPV by DNA screening in two screening rounds 5 years apart has not been assessed . The aim of this study was to assess whether HPV DNA testing in the first screen decreases detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) grade 3 or worse , CIN grade 2 or worse , and cervical cancer in the second screening . METHODS In this randomised trial , women aged 29 - 56 years participating in the cervical screening programme in the Netherlands were randomly assigned to receive HPV DNA ( GP5+/6 + -PCR method ) and cytology co-testing or cytology testing alone , from January , 1999 , to September , 2002 . Randomisation ( in a 1:1 ratio ) was done with computer-generated random numbers after the cervical specimen had been taken . At the second screening 5 years later , HPV DNA and cytology co-testing was done in both groups ; researchers were masked to the patient 's assignment . The primary endpoint was the number of CIN grade 3 or worse detected . Analysis was done by intention to screen . The trial is now finished and is registered , number ISRCTN20781131 . FINDINGS 22,420 women were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 22 518 to the control group ; 19 999 in the intervention group and 20,106 in the control group were eligible for analysis at the first screen . At the second screen , 19 579 women in the intervention group and 19,731 in the control group were eligible , of whom 16,750 and 16,743 , respectively , attended the second screen . In the second round , CIN grade 3 or worse was less common in the intervention group than in the control group ( 88 of 19 579 in the intervention group vs 122 of 19,731 in the control group ; relative risk 0·73 , 95 % CI 0·55 - 0·96 ; p=0·023 ) . Cervical cancer was also less common in the intervention group than in the control group ( four of 19 579 in the intervention group vs 14 of 19,731 ; 0·29 , 0·10 - 0·87 ; p=0·031 ) . In the baseline round , detection of CIN grade 3 or worse did not differ significantly between groups ( 171 of 19 999 vs 150 of 20,106 ; 1·15 , 0·92 - 1·43 ; p=0·239 ) but was significantly more common in women with normal cytology ( 34 of 19,286 vs 12 of 19,373 ; 2·85 , 1·47 - 5·49 ; p=0·001 ) . Furthermore , significantly more cases of CIN grade 2 or worse were detected in the intervention group than in the control group ( 267 of 19 999 vs 215 of 20,106 ; 1·25 , 1·05 - 1·50 ; p=0·015 ) . In the second screen , fewer HPV16-positive CIN grade 3 or worse were detected in the intervention group than in the control group ( 17 of 9481 vs 35 of 9354 ; 0·48 , 0·27 - 0·85 ; p=0·012 ) ; detection of non-HPV16-positive CIN grade 3 or worse did not differ between groups ( 25 of 9481 vs 25 of 9354 ; 0·99 , 0·57 - 1·72 ; p=1·00 ) . The cumulative detection of CIN grade 3 or worse and CIN grade 2 or worse did not differ significantly between study arms , neither for the whole study group ( CIN grade 3 or worse : 259 of 19 999 vs 272 of 20,106 ; 0·96 , 0·81 - 1·14 , p=0·631 ; CIN grade 2 or worse : 427 of 19 999 vs 399 of 20,106 ; 1·08 , 0·94 - 1·24 ; p=0·292 ) , nor for subgroups of women invited for the first time ( CIN grade 3 or worse in women aged 29 - 33 years : 102 of 3139 vs 105 of 3128 ; 0·97 , 0·74 - 1·27 ; CIN grade 2 or worse in women aged 29 - 33 years : 153 of 3139 vs 151 of 3128 ; 1·01 , 0·81 - 1·26 ; CIN grade 3 or worse in women aged 34 - 56 years : 157 of 16,860 vs 167 of 16 978 ; 0·95 , 0·76 - 1·18 ; CIN grade 2 or worse in women aged 34 - 56 years : 274 of 16,860 vs 248 of 16 978 ; 1·11 , 0·94 - 1·32 ) . INTERPRETATION Implementation of HPV DNA testing in cervical screening leads to earlier detection of clinically relevant CIN grade 2 or worse , which when adequately treated , improves protection against CIN grade 3 or worse and cervical cancer . Early detection of high-grade cervical legions caused by HPV16 was a major component of this benefit . Our results lend support to the use of HPV DNA testing for all women aged 29 years and older . FUNDING Zorg Onderzoek Nederland ( Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development ) . BACKGROUND Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) testing is known to be more sensitive , but less specific than cytology for detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) . We assessed the efficacy of cervical-cancer screening policies that are based on HPV testing . METHODS Between March , 2004 , and December , 2004 , in two separate recruitment phases , women aged 25 - 60 years were randomly assigned to conventional cytology or to HPV testing in combination with liquid-based cytology ( first phase ) or alone ( second phase ) . Randomisation was done by computer in two screening centres and by sequential opening of numbered sealed envelopes in the remaining seven centres . During phase one , women who were HPV-positive and aged 35 - 60 years were referred to colposcopy , whereas women aged 25 - 34 years were referred to colposcopy only if cytology was also abnormal or HPV testing was persistently positive . During phase two , women in the HPV group were referred for colposcopy if the HPV test was positive . Two rounds of screening occurred in each phase , and all women had cytology testing only at the second round . The primary endpoint was the detection of grade 2 and 3 CIN , and of invasive cervical cancers during the first and second screening rounds . Analysis was done by intention to screen . This trial is registered , number ISRCTN81678807 . FINDINGS In total for both phases , 47,001 women were randomly assigned to the cytology group and 47,369 to HPV testing . 33,851 women from the cytology group and 32,998 from the HPV-testing group had a second round of screening . We also retrieved the histological diagnoses from screening done elsewhere . The detection of invasive cervical cancers was similar for the two groups in the first round of screening ( nine in the cytology group vs seven in the HPV group , p=0.62 ) ; no cases were detected in the HPV group during round two , compared with nine in the cytology group ( p=0.004 ) . Overall , in the two rounds of screening , 18 invasive cancers were detected in the cytology group versus seven in the HPV group ( p=0.028 ) . Among women aged 35 - 60 years , at round one the relative detection ( HPV vs cytology ) was 2.00 ( 95 % CI 1.44 - 2.77 ) for CIN2 , 2.08 ( 1.47 - 2.95 ) for CIN3 , and 2.03 ( 1.60 - 2.57 ) for CIN2 and 3 together . At round two the relative detection was 0.54 ( 0.23 - 1.28 ) for CIN2 , 0.48 ( 0.21 - 1.11 ) for CIN3 , and 0.51 ( 0.28 - 0.93 ) for CIN2 and 3 together . Among women aged 25 - 34 years , there was significant heterogeneity between phases in the relative detection of CIN3 . At round one the relative detection was 0.93 ( 0.52 - 1.64 ) in phase one and 3.91 ( 2.02 - 7.57 ) in phase two . At round two the relative detection was 1.34 ( 0.46 - 3.84 ) in phase one and 0.20 ( 0.04 - 0.93 ) in phase two . Pooling both phases , the detection ratio of CIN2 for women aged 25 - 34 years was 4.09 ( 2.24 - 7.48 ) at round one and 0.64 ( 0.23 - 1.27 ) at round two . INTERPRETATION HPV-based screening is more effective than cytology in preventing invasive cervical cancer , by detecting persistent high-grade lesions earlier and providing a longer low-risk period . However , in younger women , HPV screening leads to over-diagnosis of regressive CIN2 . FUNDING European Union , Italian Ministry of Health , Regional Health Administrations of Piemonte , Tuscany , Veneto and Emilia-Romagna , and Public Health Agency of Lazio . More than ever , clinicians need regularly updated reviews given the continuously increasing amount of new information regarding innovative cervical cancer prevention methods . A summary is given from recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews on 3 possible clinical applications of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) testing : triage of women with equivocal or low-grade cytologic abnormalities ; prediction of the therapeutic outcome after treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) lesions , and last not but not least , primary screening for cervical cancer and pre-cancer . Consistent evidence is available indicating that HPV-triage with the Hybrid Capture ( ® ) 2 assay ( Qiagen Gaithersburg , Inc. , MD , USA [ previously Digene Corp. ] ( HC2 ) is more accurate ( higher sensitivity , similar specificity ) than repeat cytology to triage women with equivocal Pap smear results . Several other tests show at least similar accuracy but mRNA testing with the APTIMA ( ® ) ( Gen-Probe Inc. , San Diego , CA , USA ) test is similarly sensitive but more specific compared to HC2 . In triage of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions ( LSIL ) , HC2 is more sensitive but its specificity is substantially lower compared to repeat cytology . The APTIMA ( ® ) test is more specific than HC2 without showing a loss in sensitivity . Identification of DNA of HPV types 16 and/or 18 , or RNA from the five most carcinogenic HPV types allow selecting women at highest risk for CIN3 + but the sensitivity and negative predictive value of these markers are lower than full-range high-risk HPV ( hrHPV ) testing . After conservative treatment of cervical pre-cancer , HPV testing picks up more quickly , with higher sensitivity and not lower specificity , residual or recurrent high-grade CIN than follow-up cytology . Primary screening for hrHPV generally detects more CIN2 , CIN3 or cancer compared to cytology at cut-off atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance ( ASC-US ) or LSIL , but is less specific . Combined HPV and cytology screening provides a further small gain in sensitivity at the expense of a considerable loss in specificity if positive by either test is referred to colposcopy , in comparison with HPV testing only . Randomised trials and follow-up of cohort studies consistently demonstrate a significantly lower cumulative incidence of CIN3 + and even of cancer , in women aged 30 years or older , who were at enrollment hrHPV DNA negative compared to those who were cytologically negative . The difference in cumulative risk of CIN3 + or cancer for double negative ( cytology & HPV ) versus only HPV-negative women is small . HC2 , GP5+/6 + PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ) , cobas ( ® ) 4800 PCR ( Roche Molecular Systems Inc. , Alameda , CA , USA ) and Real Time PCR ( Abbott Molecular , Des Plaines , IL , USA ) can be considered as clinically validated for use in primary screening . The loss in specificity associated with primary HPV-based screening can be compensated by appropriate algorithms involving reflex cytology and/or HPV genotyping for HPV16 or 18 . There exists a substantial evidence base to support that HPV testing is advantageous both in triage of women with equivocal abnormal cytology , in surveillance after treatment of CIN lesions and in primary screening of women aged 30 years or older . However , the possible advantages offered by HPV-based screening require a well organised program with good compliance with screening and triage policies . This article forms part of a special supplement entitled "" Comprehensive Control of HPV Infections and Related Diseases "" Vaccine Volume 30 , Supplement 5 , 2012 . BACKGROUND Screening for cervical cancer based on testing for human papillomavirus ( HPV ) increases the sensitivity of detection of high-grade ( grade 2 or 3 ) cervical intraepithelial neoplasia , but whether this gain represents overdiagnosis or protection against future high-grade cervical epithelial neoplasia or cervical cancer is unknown . METHODS In a population-based screening program in Sweden , 12,527 women 32 to 38 years of age were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to have an HPV test plus a Papanicolaou ( Pap ) test ( intervention group ) or a Pap test alone ( control group ) . Women with a positive HPV test and a normal Pap test result were offered a second HPV test at least 1 year later , and those who were found to be persistently infected with the same high-risk type of HPV were then offered colposcopy with cervical biopsy . A similar number of double-blinded Pap smears and colposcopies with biopsy were performed in randomly selected women in the control group . Comprehensive registry data were used to follow the women for a mean of 4.1 years . The relative rates of grade 2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer detected at enrollment and at subsequent screening examinations were calculated . RESULTS At enrollment , the proportion of women in the intervention group who were found to have lesions of grade 2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer was 51 % greater ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 13 to 102 ) than the proportion of women in the control group who were found to have such lesions . At subsequent screening examinations , the proportion of women in the intervention group who were found to have grade 2 or 3 lesions or cancer was 42 % less ( 95 % CI , 4 to 64 ) and the proportion with grade 3 lesions or cancer was 47 % less ( 95 % CI , 2 to 71 ) than the proportions of control women who were found to have such lesions . Women with persistent HPV infection remained at high risk for grade 2 or 3 lesions or cancer after referral for colposcopy . CONCLUSIONS The addition of an HPV test to the Pap test to screen women in their mid-30s for cervical cancer reduces the incidence of grade 2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer detected by subsequent screening examinations .

128,"Local translation mediates axonal responses to Semaphorin3A ( Sema3A ) and other guidance cues . However , only a subset of the axonal proteome is locally synthesized , whereas most proteins are trafficked from the soma . The reason why only specific proteins are locally synthesized is unknown . Here we show that local protein synthesis and degradation are linked events in growth cones . We find that growth cones exhibit high levels of ubiquitination and that local signalling pathways trigger the ubiquitination and degradation of RhoA , a mediator of Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse . Inhibition of RhoA degradation is sufficient to remove the protein-synthesis requirement for Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse . In addition to RhoA , we find that locally translated proteins are the main targets of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in growth cones . Thus , local protein degradation is a major feature of growth cones and creates a requirement for local translation to replenish proteins needed to maintain growth cone responses .

However , given that microRNAs bind to RNAs , we hypothesized that RNAs could possess a regulatory role that relies on their ability to compete for microRNA binding , independently of their protein-coding function . As a model for the protein-coding-independent role of RNAs , we describe the functional relationship between the mRNAs produced by the PTEN tumour suppressor gene and its pseudogene PTENP1 and the critical consequences of this interaction . We find that PTENP1 is biologically active as it can regulate cellular levels of PTEN and exert a growth-suppressive role . We also show that the PTENP1 locus is selectively lost in human cancer . We extended our analysis to other cancer-related genes that possess pseudogenes , such as oncogenic KRAS . We also demonstrate that the transcripts of protein-coding genes such as PTEN are biologically active .

Here , we demonstrate that the replication efficiency of guanine-rich ( G-rich ) telomeric repeats is decreased significantly in cells lacking HR . Treatment with the G4-stabilizing compound pyridostatin ( PDS ) increases telomere fragility in BRCA2-deficient cells , suggesting that G4 formation drives telomere instability . Remarkably , PDS reduces proliferation of HR-defective cells by inducing DSB accumulation , checkpoint activation , and deregulated G2/M progression and by enhancing the replication defect intrinsic to HR deficiency . PDS toxicity extends to HR-defective cells that have acquired olaparib resistance through loss of 53BP1 or REV7 .

The treatment was chosen because of a high operative risk , previous thyroidectomy , or refusal to be operated on . MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Standard thyroid function variables and ultrasonically determined thyroid volume before treatment as well as 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , and 12 months after treatment and then once a year . RESULTS 56 patients were treated with a single dose of 131I , 12 with two doses , and one with four doses . In 45 patients treated with one dose and remaining euthyroid the median thyroid volume was reduced from 73 ( interquartile range 50 - 106 ) ml to 29 ( 23 - 48 ) ml at 24 months in the 39 patients in whom this was measured during follow up . The median reduction was 40 ( 22 - 48 ) ml ( 60 % reduction , p < 0.0001 ) , half of which occurred within three months . Patients treated with two doses as well as those developing hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism had a significant reduction in thyroid volume . Eleven patients developed hypothyroidism ( cumulative five year risk 22 % , 95 % confidence interval 4.8 % to 38.4 % ) . Side effects were few : three cases of hyperthyroidism and two cases of radiation thyroiditis . Only one patient was dissatisfied with the result ; she was referred for operation six months after treatment . CONCLUSIONS A substantial reduction in thyroid volume accompanied by a low incidence of hypothyroidism and few side effects makes the use of radioactive iodine an attractive alternative to surgery in selected cases of non-toxic multinodular goitre .

132,"Two-component signal transduction pathways comprising histidine protein kinases ( HPKs ) and their response regulators ( RRs ) are widely used to control bacterial responses to environmental challenges . Some bacteria have over 150 different two-component pathways , and the specificity of the phosphotransfer reactions within these systems is tightly controlled to prevent unwanted crosstalk . One of the best understood two-component signalling pathways is the chemotaxis pathway . Here , we present the 1.40 A crystal structure of the histidine-containing phosphotransfer domain of the chemotaxis HPK , CheA(3 ) , in complex with its cognate RR , CheY(6 ) . A methionine finger on CheY(6 ) that nestles in a hydrophobic pocket in CheA(3 ) was shown to be important for the interaction and was found to only occur in the cognate RRs of CheA(3 ) , CheY(6 ) , and CheB(2 ) . Site-directed mutagenesis of this methionine in combination with two adjacent residues abolished binding , as shown by surface plasmon resonance studies , and phosphotransfer from CheA(3)-P to CheY(6 ) . Introduction of this methionine and an adjacent alanine residue into a range of noncognate CheYs , dramatically changed their specificity , allowing protein interaction and rapid phosphotransfer from CheA(3)-P. The structure presented here has allowed us to identify specificity determinants for the CheA-CheY interaction and subsequently to successfully reengineer phosphotransfer signalling . In summary , our results provide valuable insight into how cells mediate specificity in one of the most abundant signalling pathways in biology , two-component signal transduction .

To devise this map , we identified transcriptional enhancers and insulators in these cells and placed them within the context of cohesin-associated CTCF-CTCF loops using cohesin ChIA-PET data . The CTCF-CTCF loops we identified form a chromosomal framework of insulated neighborhoods , which in turn form topologically associating domains ( TADs ) that are largely preserved during the transition between the naive and primed states . Regulatory changes in enhancer-promoter interactions occur within insulated neighborhoods during cell state transition . The CTCF anchor regions we identified are conserved across species , influence gene expression , and are a frequent site of mutations in cancer cells , underscoring their functional importance in cellular regulation .

136,"Numerous reports have demonstrated that CD4(+)CD25(+ ) regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) from individuals with a range of human autoimmune diseases , including type 1 diabetes , are deficient in their ability to control autologous proinflammatory responses when compared with nondiseased , control individuals . Treg dysfunction could be a primary , causal event or may result from perturbations in the immune system during disease development . Polymorphisms in genes associated with Treg function , such as IL2RA , confer a higher risk of autoimmune disease . Although this suggests a primary role for defective Tregs in autoimmunity , a link between IL2RA gene polymorphisms and Treg function has not been examined . We addressed this by examining the impact of an IL2RA haplotype associated with type 1 diabetes on Treg fitness and suppressive function . Studies were conducted using healthy human subjects to avoid any confounding effects of disease . We demonstrated that the presence of an autoimmune disease-associated IL2RA haplotype correlates with diminished IL-2 responsiveness in Ag-experienced CD4(+ ) T cells , as measured by phosphorylation of STAT5a , and is associated with lower levels of FOXP3 expression by Tregs and a reduction in their ability to suppress proliferation of autologous effector T cells . These data offer a rationale that contributes to the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which polymorphisms in the IL-2RA gene affect immune regulation , and consequently upon susceptibility to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases . Autoimmune diseases are thought to result from imbalances in normal immune physiology and regulation . Here , we show that autoimmune disease susceptibility and resistance alleles on mouse chromosome 3 ( Idd3 ) correlate with differential expression of the key immunoregulatory cytokine interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) . In order to test directly that an approximately twofold reduction in IL-2 underpins the Idd3-linked destabilization of immune homeostasis , we show that engineered haplodeficiency of Il2 gene expression not only reduces T cell IL-2 production by twofold but also mimics the autoimmune dysregulatory effects of the naturally occurring susceptibility alleles of Il2 . Reduced IL-2 production achieved by either genetic mechanism correlates with reduced function of CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells , which are critical for maintaining immune homeostasis . Genome-wide association studies are now identifying disease-associated chromosome regions . However , even after convincing replication , the localization of the causal variant(s ) requires comprehensive resequencing , extensive genotyping and statistical analyses in large sample sets leading to targeted functional studies . Here , we have localized the type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) association in the interleukin 2 receptor alpha ( IL2RA ) gene region to two independent groups of SNPs , spanning overlapping regions of 14 and 40 kb , encompassing IL2RA intron 1 and the 5′ regions of IL2RA and RBM17 ( odds ratio = 2.04 , 95 % confidence interval = 1.70–2.45 ; P = 1.92 × 10−28 ; control frequency = 0.635 ) . Furthermore , we have associated IL2RA T1D susceptibility genotypes with lower circulating levels of the biomarker , soluble IL-2RA ( P = 6.28 × 10−28 ) , suggesting that an inherited lower immune responsiveness predisposes to T1D .

137,"Nucleosomes containing the histone variant H3.3 tend to be clustered in vivo in the neighborhood of transcriptionally active genes and over regulatory elements . It has not been clear , however , whether H3.3-containing nucleosomes possess unique properties that would affect transcription . We report here that H3.3 nucleosomes isolated from vertebrates , regardless of whether they are partnered with H2A or H2A.Z , are unusually sensitive to salt-dependent disruption , losing H2A/H2B or H2A.Z/H2B dimers . Immunoprecipitation studies of nucleosome core particles ( NCPs ) show that NCPs that contain both H3.3 and H2A.Z are even less stable than NCPs containing H3.3 and H2A . Intriguingly , NCPs containing H3 and H2A.Z are at least as stable as H3/H2A NCPs . These results establish an hierarchy of stabilities for native nucleosomes carrying different complements of variants , and suggest how H2A.Z could play different roles depending on its partners within the NCP . They also are consistent with the idea that H3.3 plays an active role in maintaining accessible chromatin structures in enhancer regions and transcribed regions . Consistent with this idea , promoters and enhancers at transcriptionally active genes and coding regions at highly expressed genes have nucleosomes that simultaneously carry both H3.3 and H2A.Z , and should therefore be extremely sensitive to disruption .

138,"Historically , the ribosome has been viewed as a complex ribozyme with constitutive rather than regulatory capacity in mRNA translation . Here we identify mutations of the Ribosomal Protein L38 ( Rpl38 ) gene in mice exhibiting surprising tissue-specific patterning defects , including pronounced homeotic transformations of the axial skeleton . In Rpl38 mutant embryos , global protein synthesis is unchanged ; however the translation of a select subset of Homeobox mRNAs is perturbed . Our data reveal that RPL38 facilitates 80S complex formation on these mRNAs as a regulatory component of the ribosome to confer transcript-specific translational control . We further show that Rpl38 expression is markedly enriched in regions of the embryo where loss-of-function phenotypes occur .

139,"S-nitrosylation of proteins by nitric oxide is a major mode of signalling in cells . S-nitrosylation can mediate the regulation of a range of proteins , including prominent nuclear proteins , such as HDAC2 ( ref . 2 ) and PARP1 ( ref . 3 ) . The high reactivity of the nitric oxide group with protein thiols , but the selective nature of nitrosylation within the cell , implies the existence of targeting mechanisms . Specificity of nitric oxide signalling is often achieved by the binding of nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) to target proteins , either directly or through scaffolding proteins such as PSD-95 ( ref . 5 ) and CAPON . As the three principal isoforms of NOS -- neuronal NOS ( nNOS ) , endothelial NOS ( eNOS ) and inducible NOS (iNOS)--are primarily non-nuclear , the mechanisms by which nuclear proteins are selectively nitrosylated have been elusive .

140,"CONTEXT Sexual dysfunction is a common adverse effect of antidepressants that frequently results in treatment noncompliance . OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy of sildenafil citrate in men with sexual dysfunction associated with the use of selective and nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SRI ) antidepressants . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PATIENTS Prospective , parallel-group , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted between November 1 , 2000 , and January 1 , 2001 , at 3 US university medical centers among 90 male outpatients ( mean [ SD ] age , 45 [ 8 ] years ) with major depression in remission and sexual dysfunction associated with SRI antidepressant treatment . INTERVENTION Patients were randomly assigned to take sildenafil ( n = 45 ) or placebo ( n = 45 ) at a flexible dose starting at 50 mg and adjustable to 100 mg before sexual activity for 6 weeks . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measure was score on the Clinical Global Impression-Sexual Function ( CGI-SF ) ; secondary measures were scores on the International Index of Erectile Function , Arizona Sexual Experience Scale , Massachusetts General Hospital-Sexual Functioning Questionnaire , and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ( HAM-D ) . RESULTS Among the 90 randomized patients , 93 % ( 83/89 ) of patients treated per protocol took at least 1 dose of study drug and 85 % ( 76/89 ) completed week 6 end-point assessments with last observation carried forward analyses . At a CGI-SF score of 2 or lower , 54.5 % ( 24/44 ) of sildenafil compared with 4.4 % ( 2/45 ) of placebo patients were much or very much improved ( P<.001 ) . Erectile function , arousal , ejaculation , orgasm , and overall satisfaction domain measures improved significantly in sildenafil compared with placebo patients . Mean depression scores remained consistent with remission ( HAM-D score < or = 10 ) in both groups for the study duration . CONCLUSION In our study , sildenafil effectively improved erectile function and other aspects of sexual function in men with sexual dysfunction associated with the use of SRI antidepressants . These improvements may allow patients to maintain adherence with effective antidepressant treatment .

142,"Modification of proteins by SUMO is essential for the maintenance of genome integrity . During DNA replication , the Mms21-branch of the SUMO pathway counteracts recombination intermediates at damaged replication forks , thus facilitating sister chromatid disjunction . The Mms21 SUMO ligase docks to the arm region of the Smc5 protein in the Smc5/6 complex ; together , they cooperate during recombinational DNA repair . Yet how the activity of the SUMO ligase is controlled remains unknown . Here we show that the SUMO ligase and the chromosome disjunction functions of Mms21 depend on its docking to an intact and active Smc5/6 complex , indicating that the Smc5/6-Mms21 complex operates as a large SUMO ligase in vivo . In spite of the physical distance separating the E3 and the nucleotide-binding domains in Smc5/6 , Mms21-dependent sumoylation requires binding of ATP to Smc5 , a step that is part of the ligase mechanism that assists Ubc9 function . The communication is enabled by the presence of a conserved disruption in the coiled coil domain of Smc5 , pointing to potential conformational changes for SUMO ligase activation . In accordance , scanning force microscopy of the Smc5-Mms21 heterodimer shows that the molecule is physically remodeled in an ATP-dependent manner . Our results demonstrate that the ATP-binding activity of the Smc5/6 complex is coordinated with its SUMO ligase , through the coiled coil domain of Smc5 and the physical remodeling of the molecule , to promote sumoylation and chromosome disjunction during DNA repair .

Exposures Anticoagulation therapy before ICH , defined as any use of OACs within 7 days prior to hospital arrival . Main Outcomes and Measures In-hospital mortality . Results Among 141 311 patients with ICH ( mean [ SD ] age , 68.3 [ 15.3 ] years ; 48.1 % women ) , 15 036 ( 10.6 % ) were taking warfarin and 4918 ( 3.5 % ) were taking NOACs preceding ICH , and 39 585 ( 28.0 % ) and 5783 ( 4.1 % ) were taking concomitant single and dual antiplatelet agents , respectively . Patients with prior use of warfarin or NOACs were older and had higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation and prior stroke . Acute ICH stroke severity ( measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ) was not significantly different across the 3 groups ( median , 9 [ interquartile range , 2 - 21 ] for warfarin , 8 [ 2 - 20 ] for NOACs , and 8 [ 2 - 19 ] for no OACs ) . The unadjusted in-hospital mortality rates were 32.6 % for warfarin , 26.5 % for NOACs , and 22.5 % for no OACs . Compared with patients without prior use of OACs , the risk of in-hospital mortality was higher among patients with prior use of warfarin ( adjusted risk difference [ ARD ] , 9.0 % [ 97.5 % CI , 7.9 % to 10.1 % ] ; adjusted odds ratio [ AOR ] , 1.62 [ 97.5 % CI , 1.53 to 1.71 ] ) and higher among patients with prior use of NOACs ( ARD , 3.3 % [ 97.5 % CI , 1.7 % to 4.8 % ] ; AOR , 1.21 [ 97.5 % CI , 1.11 - 1.32 ] ) . Compared with patients with prior use of warfarin , patients with prior use of NOACs had a lower risk of in-hospital mortality ( ARD , −5.7 % [ 97.5 % CI , −7.3 % to −4.2 % ] ; AOR , 0.75 [ 97.5 % CI , 0.69 to 0.81 ] ) . The difference in mortality between NOAC-treated patients and warfarin-treated patients was numerically greater among patients with prior use of dual antiplatelet agents ( 32.7 % vs 47.1 % ; ARD , −15.0 % [ 95.5 % CI , −26.3 % to −3.8 % ] ; AOR , 0.50 [ 97.5 % CI , 0.29 to 0.86 ] ) than among those taking these agents without prior antiplatelet therapy ( 26.4 % vs 31.7 % ; ARD , −5.0 % [ 97.5 % CI , −6.8 % to −3.2 % ] ; AOR , 0.77 [ 97.5 % CI , 0.70 to 0.85 ] ) , although the interaction P value ( .07 ) was not statistically significant .

145,"BACKGROUND The Global Burden of Diseases , Injuries , and Risk Factors Study 2015 provides an up-to-date synthesis of the evidence for risk factor exposure and the attributable burden of disease . By providing national and subnational assessments spanning the past 25 years , this study can inform debates on the importance of addressing risks in context . METHODS We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for previous iterations of the Global Burden of Disease Study to estimate attributable deaths , disability-adjusted life-years ( DALYs ) , and trends in exposure by age group , sex , year , and geography for 79 behavioural , environmental and occupational , and metabolic risks or clusters of risks from 1990 to 2015 . This study included 388 risk-outcome pairs that met World Cancer Research Fund-defined criteria for convincing or probable evidence . We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from randomised controlled trials , cohorts , pooled cohorts , household surveys , census data , satellite data , and other sources . We used statistical models to pool data , adjust for bias , and incorporate covariates . We developed a metric that allows comparisons of exposure across risk factors-the summary exposure value . Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk level , we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk . We decomposed trends in attributable burden into contributions from population growth , population age structure , risk exposure , and risk-deleted cause-specific DALY rates . We characterised risk exposure in relation to a Socio-demographic Index ( SDI ) . FINDINGS Between 1990 and 2015 , global exposure to unsafe sanitation , household air pollution , childhood underweight , childhood stunting , and smoking each decreased by more than 25 % . Global exposure for several occupational risks , high body-mass index ( BMI ) , and drug use increased by more than 25 % over the same period . All risks jointly evaluated in 2015 accounted for 57·8 % ( 95 % CI 56·6 - 58·8 ) of global deaths and 41·2 % ( 39·8 - 42·8 ) of DALYs . In 2015 , the ten largest contributors to global DALYs among Level 3 risks were high systolic blood pressure ( 211·8 million [ 192·7 million to 231·1 million ] global DALYs ) , smoking ( 148·6 million [ 134·2 million to 163·1 million ] ) , high fasting plasma glucose ( 143·1 million [ 125·1 million to 163·5 million ] ) , high BMI ( 120·1 million [ 83·8 million to 158·4 million ] ) , childhood undernutrition ( 113·3 million [ 103·9 million to 123·4 million ] ) , ambient particulate matter ( 103·1 million [ 90·8 million to 115·1 million ] ) , high total cholesterol ( 88·7 million [ 74·6 million to 105·7 million ] ) , household air pollution ( 85·6 million [ 66·7 million to 106·1 million ] ) , alcohol use ( 85·0 million [ 77·2 million to 93·0 million ] ) , and diets high in sodium ( 83·0 million [ 49·3 million to 127·5 million ] ) . From 1990 to 2015 , attributable DALYs declined for micronutrient deficiencies , childhood undernutrition , unsafe sanitation and water , and household air pollution ; reductions in risk-deleted DALY rates rather than reductions in exposure drove these declines . Rising exposure contributed to notable increases in attributable DALYs from high BMI , high fasting plasma glucose , occupational carcinogens , and drug use . Environmental risks and childhood undernutrition declined steadily with SDI ; low physical activity , high BMI , and high fasting plasma glucose increased with SDI . In 119 countries , metabolic risks , such as high BMI and fasting plasma glucose , contributed the most attributable DALYs in 2015 . Regionally , smoking still ranked among the leading five risk factors for attributable DALYs in 109 countries ; childhood underweight and unsafe sex remained primary drivers of early death and disability in much of sub-Saharan Africa . INTERPRETATION Declines in some key environmental risks have contributed to declines in critical infectious diseases . Some risks appear to be invariant to SDI . Increasing risks , including high BMI , high fasting plasma glucose , drug use , and some occupational exposures , contribute to rising burden from some conditions , but also provide opportunities for intervention . Some highly preventable risks , such as smoking , remain major causes of attributable DALYs , even as exposure is declining . Public policy makers need to pay attention to the risks that are increasingly major contributors to global burden . FUNDING Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .

146,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) and its receptor TrkB are crucial for many forms of neuronal plasticity , including structural long-term potentiation ( sLTP ) , which is a correlate of an animal ’s learning . However , it is unknown whether BDNF release and TrkB activation occur during sLTP , and if so , when and where . Here , using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based sensor for TrkB and two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy , we monitor TrkB activity in single dendritic spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons in cultured murine hippocampal slices . In response to sLTP induction , we find fast ( onset < 1 min ) and sustained ( > 20 min ) activation of TrkB in the stimulated spine that depends on NMDAR ( N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor ) and CaMKII signalling and on postsynaptically synthesized BDNF . We confirm the presence of postsynaptic BDNF using electron microscopy to localize endogenous BDNF to dendrites and spines of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons . Consistent with these findings , we also show rapid , glutamate-uncaging-evoked , time-locked BDNF release from single dendritic spines using BDNF fused to superecliptic pHluorin . We demonstrate that this postsynaptic BDNF – TrkB signalling pathway is necessary for both structural and functional LTP . Together , these findings reveal a spine-autonomous , autocrine signalling mechanism involving NMDAR – CaMKII-dependent BDNF release from stimulated dendritic spines and subsequent TrkB activation on these same spines that is crucial for structural and functional plasticity .

The mechanism by which TCRalphabeta ligand binding confers conformational changes to CD3 is unknown . By using well-defined ligands , we showed that induction of the conformational change requires both multivalent engagement and the mobility restriction of the TCR-CD3 imposed by the plasma membrane . The conformational change is elicited by cooperative rearrangements of two TCR-CD3 complexes and does not require accompanying changes in the structure of the TCRalphabeta ectodomains . This conformational change at CD3 reverts upon ligand dissociation and is required for T cell activation .

149,"Glioblastomas are deadly cancers that display a functional cellular hierarchy maintained by self-renewing glioblastoma stem cells ( GSCs ) . GSCs are regulated by molecular pathways distinct from the bulk tumor that may be useful therapeutic targets . We determined that A20 ( TNFAIP3 ) , a regulator of cell survival and the NF-kappaB pathway , is overexpressed in GSCs relative to non-stem glioblastoma cells at both the mRNA and protein levels . To determine the functional significance of A20 in GSCs , we targeted A20 expression with lentiviral-mediated delivery of short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) . Inhibiting A20 expression decreased GSC growth and survival through mechanisms associated with decreased cell-cycle progression and decreased phosphorylation of p65/RelA. Elevated levels of A20 in GSCs contributed to apoptotic resistance : GSCs were less susceptible to TNFalpha-induced cell death than matched non-stem glioma cells , but A20 knockdown sensitized GSCs to TNFalpha-mediated apoptosis . The decreased survival of GSCs upon A20 knockdown contributed to the reduced ability of these cells to self-renew in primary and secondary neurosphere formation assays . The tumorigenic potential of GSCs was decreased with A20 targeting , resulting in increased survival of mice bearing human glioma xenografts . In silico analysis of a glioma patient genomic database indicates that A20 overexpression and amplification is inversely correlated with survival . Together these data indicate that A20 contributes to glioma maintenance through effects on the glioma stem cell subpopulation . Although inactivating mutations in A20 in lymphoma suggest A20 can act as a tumor suppressor , similar point mutations have not been identified through glioma genomic sequencing : in fact , our data suggest A20 may function as a tumor enhancer in glioma through promotion of GSC survival . A20 anticancer therapies should therefore be viewed with caution as effects will likely differ depending on the tumor type .

150,"CONTEXT Many individuals take vitamins in the hopes of preventing chronic diseases such as cancer , and vitamins E and C are among the most common individual supplements . A large-scale randomized trial suggested that vitamin E may reduce risk of prostate cancer ; however , few trials have been powered to address this relationship . No previous trial in men at usual risk has examined vitamin C alone in the prevention of cancer . OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether long-term vitamin E or C supplementation decreases risk of prostate and total cancer events among men . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS The Physicians ' Health Study II is a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled factorial trial of vitamins E and C that began in 1997 and continued until its scheduled completion on August 31 , 2007 . A total of 14,641 male physicians in the United States initially aged 50 years or older , including 1307 men with a history of prior cancer at randomization , were enrolled . INTERVENTION Individual supplements of 400 IU of vitamin E every other day and 500 mg of vitamin C daily . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Prostate and total cancer . RESULTS During a mean follow-up of 8.0 years , there were 1008 confirmed incident cases of prostate cancer and 1943 total cancers . Compared with placebo , vitamin E had no effect on the incidence of prostate cancer ( active and placebo vitamin E groups , 9.1 and 9.5 events per 1000 person-years ; hazard ratio [ HR ] , 0.97 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.85 - 1.09 ; P = .58 ) or total cancer ( active and placebo vitamin E groups , 17.8 and 17.3 cases per 1000 person-years ; HR , 1.04 ; 95 % CI , 0.95 - 1.13 ; P = .41 ) . There was also no significant effect of vitamin C on total cancer ( active and placebo vitamin C groups , 17.6 and 17.5 events per 1000 person-years ; HR , 1.01 ; 95 % CI , 0.92 - 1.10 ; P = .86 ) or prostate cancer ( active and placebo vitamin C groups , 9.4 and 9.2 cases per 1000 person-years ; HR , 1.02 ; 95 % CI , 0.90 - 1.15 ; P = .80 ) . Neither vitamin E nor vitamin C had a significant effect on colorectal , lung , or other site-specific cancers . Adjustment for adherence and exclusion of the first 4 or 6 years of follow-up did not alter the results . Stratification by various cancer risk factors demonstrated no significant modification of the effect of vitamin E on prostate cancer risk or either agent on total cancer risk . CONCLUSIONS In this large , long-term trial of male physicians , neither vitamin E nor C supplementation reduced the risk of prostate or total cancer . These data provide no support for the use of these supplements for the prevention of cancer in middle-aged and older men . TRIAL REGISTRATION clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT00270647 .

151,"BACKGROUND Taxing sugar-sweetened beverages ( SSBs ) has been proposed in high-income countries to reduce obesity and type 2 diabetes . We sought to estimate the potential health effects of such a fiscal strategy in the middle-income country of India , where there is heterogeneity in SSB consumption , patterns of substitution between SSBs and other beverages after tax increases , and vast differences in chronic disease risk within the population . METHODS AND FINDINGS Using consumption and price variations data from a nationally representative survey of 100,855 Indian households , we first calculated how changes in SSB price alter per capita consumption of SSBs and substitution with other beverages . We then incorporated SSB sales trends , body mass index ( BMI ) , and diabetes incidence data stratified by age , sex , income , and urban/rural residence into a validated microsimulation of caloric consumption , glycemic load , overweight/obesity prevalence , and type 2 diabetes incidence among Indian subpopulations facing a 20 % SSB excise tax . The 20 % SSB tax was anticipated to reduce overweight and obesity prevalence by 3.0 % ( 95 % CI 1.6%-5.9 % ) and type 2 diabetes incidence by 1.6 % ( 95 % CI 1.2%-1.9 % ) among various Indian subpopulations over the period 2014 - 2023 , if SSB consumption continued to increase linearly in accordance with secular trends . However , acceleration in SSB consumption trends consistent with industry marketing models would be expected to increase the impact efficacy of taxation , averting 4.2 % of prevalent overweight/obesity ( 95 % CI 2.5 - 10.0 % ) and 2.5 % ( 95 % CI 1.0 - 2.8 % ) of incident type 2 diabetes from 2014 - 2023 . Given current consumption and BMI distributions , our results suggest the largest relative effect would be expected among young rural men , refuting our a priori hypothesis that urban populations would be isolated beneficiaries of SSB taxation . Key limitations of this estimation approach include the assumption that consumer expenditure behavior from prior years , captured in price elasticities , will reflect future behavior among consumers , and potential underreporting of consumption in dietary recall data used to inform our calculations . CONCLUSION Sustained SSB taxation at a high tax rate could mitigate rising obesity and type 2 diabetes in India among both urban and rural subpopulations .

152,"Background Extensive debate exists in the healthcare community over whether outcomes of medical care at teaching hospitals and other healthcare units are better or worse than those at the respective nonteaching ones . Thus , our goal was to systematically evaluate the evidence pertaining to this question . Methods and Findings We reviewed all studies that compared teaching versus nonteaching healthcare structures for mortality or any other patient outcome , regardless of health condition . Studies were retrieved from PubMed , contact with experts , and literature cross-referencing . Data were extracted on setting , patients , data sources , author affiliations , definition of compared groups , types of diagnoses considered , adjusting covariates , and estimates of effect for mortality and for each other outcome . Overall , 132 eligible studies were identified , including 93 on mortality and 61 on other eligible outcomes ( 22 addressed both ) . Synthesis of the available adjusted estimates on mortality yielded a summary relative risk of 0.96 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.93–1.00 ) for teaching versus nonteaching healthcare structures and 1.04 ( 95 % CI , 0.99–1.10 ) for minor teaching versus nonteaching ones . There was considerable heterogeneity between studies ( I2 = 72 % for the main analysis ) . Results were similar in studies using clinical and those using administrative databases . No differences were seen in the 14 studies fully adjusting for volume/experience , severity , and comorbidity ( relative risk 1.01 ) . Smaller studies did not differ in their results from larger studies . Differences were seen for some diagnoses ( e.g. , significantly better survival for breast cancer and cerebrovascular accidents in teaching hospitals and significantly better survival from cholecystectomy in nonteaching hospitals ) , but these were small in magnitude . Other outcomes were diverse , but typically teaching healthcare structures did not do better than nonteaching ones . Conclusions The available data are limited by their nonrandomized design , but overall they do not suggest that a healthcare facility 's teaching status on its own markedly improves or worsens patient outcomes .

153,"Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ( AML ) is an aggressive cancer that strikes both adults and children and is frequently resistant to therapy . Thus , identifying signals needed for AML propagation is a critical step toward developing new approaches for treating this disease . Here , we show that Tetraspanin 3 is a target of the RNA binding protein Musashi 2 , which plays a key role in AML . We generated Tspan3 knockout mice that were born without overt defects . However , Tspan3 deletion impaired leukemia stem cell self-renewal and disease propagation and markedly improved survival in mouse models of AML . Additionally , Tspan3 inhibition blocked growth of AML patient samples , suggesting that Tspan3 is also important in human disease .

156,"CONTEXT Blood type and crossmatch incompatibility will exclude at least one third of patients in need from receiving a live donor kidney transplant . Kidney paired donation ( KPD ) offers incompatible donor/recipient pairs the opportunity to match for compatible transplants . Despite its increasing popularity , very few transplants have resulted from KPD . OBJECTIVE To determine the potential impact of improved matching schemes on the number and quality of transplants achievable with KPD . DESIGN , SETTING , AND POPULATION We developed a model that simulates pools of incompatible donor/recipient pairs . We designed a mathematically verifiable optimized matching algorithm and compared it with the scheme currently used in some centers and regions . Simulated patients from the general community with characteristics drawn from distributions describing end-stage renal disease patients eligible for renal transplantation and their willing and eligible live donors . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Number of kidneys matched , HLA mismatch of matched kidneys , and number of grafts surviving 5 years after transplantation . RESULTS A national optimized matching algorithm would result in more transplants ( 47.7 % vs 42.0 % , P<.001 ) , better HLA concordance ( 3.0 vs 4.5 mismatched antigens ; P<.001 ) , more grafts surviving at 5 years ( 34.9 % vs 28.7 % ; P<.001 ) , and a reduction in the number of pairs required to travel ( 2.9 % vs 18.4 % ; P<.001 ) when compared with an extension of the currently used first-accept scheme to a national level . Furthermore , highly sensitized patients would benefit 6-fold from a national optimized scheme ( 2.3 % vs 14.1 % successfully matched ; P<.001 ) . Even if only 7 % of patients awaiting kidney transplantation participated in an optimized national KPD program , the health care system could save as much as $ 750 million . CONCLUSIONS The combination of a national KPD program and a mathematically optimized matching algorithm yields more matches with lower HLA disparity . Optimized matching affords patients the flexibility of customizing their matching priorities and the security of knowing that the greatest number of high-quality matches will be found and distributed equitably .

157,"The Hippo pathway controls organ size and tissue homeostasis , with deregulation leading to cancer . The core Hippo components in mammals are composed of the upstream serine/threonine kinases Mst1/2 , MAPK4Ks and Lats1/2 . Inactivation of these upstream kinases leads to dephosphorylation , stabilization , nuclear translocation and thus activation of the major functional transducers of the Hippo pathway , YAP and its paralogue TAZ . YAP/TAZ are transcription co-activators that regulate gene expression primarily through interaction with the TEA domain DNA-binding family of transcription factors ( TEAD ) . The current paradigm for regulation of this pathway centres on phosphorylation-dependent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of YAP/TAZ through a complex network of upstream components . However , unlike other transcription factors , such as SMAD , NF-κB , NFAT and STAT , the regulation of TEAD nucleocytoplasmic shuttling has been largely overlooked . In the present study , we show that environmental stress promotes TEAD cytoplasmic translocation via p38 MAPK in a Hippo-independent manner .

When plated in monolayer cultures , these KDRlow/C-KITneg cells differentiate to generate populations consisting of greater than 50 % contracting cardiomyocytes .

The formation of active metabolites is catalyzed by the polymorphic cytochrome P450 2D6 ( CYP2D6 ) enzyme . OBJECTIVE To determine whether CYP2D6 variation is associated with clinical outcomes in women receiving adjuvant tamoxifen . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PATIENTS Retrospective analysis of German and US cohorts of patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen for early stage breast cancer . The 1325 patients had diagnoses between 1986 and 2005 of stage I through III breast cancer and were mainly postmenopausal ( 95.4 % ) . Last follow-up was in December 2008 ; inclusion criteria were hormone receptor positivity , no metastatic disease at diagnosis , adjuvant tamoxifen therapy , and no chemotherapy . DNA from tumor tissue or blood was genotyped for CYP2D6 variants associated with reduced ( * 10 , * 41 ) or absent ( * 3 , * 4 , * 5 ) enzyme activity . Women were classified as having an extensive ( n=609 ) , heterozygous extensive/intermediate ( n=637 ) , or poor ( n=79 ) CYP2D6 metabolism . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Time to recurrence , event-free survival , disease-free survival , and overall survival . RESULTS Median follow-up was 6.3 years . At 9 years of follow-up , the recurrence rates were 14.9 % for extensive metabolizers , 20.9 % for heterozygous extensive/intermediate metabolizers , and 29.0 % for poor metabolizers , and all-cause mortality rates were 16.7 % , 18.0 % , and 22.8 % , respectively . Compared with extensive metabolizers , there was a significantly increased risk of recurrence for heterozygous extensive/intermediate metabolizers ( time to recurrence adjusted hazard ratio [ HR ] , 1.40 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.04 - 1.90 ) and for poor metabolizers ( time to recurrence HR , 1.90 ; 95 % CI , 1.10 - 3.28 ) . Compared with extensive metabolizers , those with decreased CYP2D6 activity ( heterozygous extensive/intermediate and poor metabolism ) had worse event-free survival ( HR , 1.33 ; 95 % CI , 1.06 - 1.68 ) and disease-free survival ( HR , 1.29 ; 95 % CI , 1.03 - 1.61 ) , but there was no significant difference in overall survival ( HR , 1.15 ; 95 % CI , 0.88 - 1.51 ) .

OBJECTIVE To examine associations between indirect markers of hormonal exposures , such as placental weight and other pregnancy characteristics , and maternal risk of developing breast cancer . DESIGN AND SETTING Population-based cohort study using data from the Swedish Birth Register , the Swedish Cancer Register , the Swedish Cause of Death Register , and the Swedish Register of Population and Population Changes . PARTICIPANTS Women included in the Sweden Birth Register who delivered singletons between 1982 and 1989 , with complete information on date of birth and gestational age . Women were followed up until the occurrence of breast cancer , death , or end of follow-up ( December 31 , 2001 ) . Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate associations between hormone exposures and risks of breast cancer . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Incidence of invasive breast cancer . RESULTS Of 314,019 women in the cohort , 2216 ( 0.7 % ) developed breast cancer during the follow-up through 2001 , of whom 2100 ( 95 % ) were diagnosed before age 50 years . Compared with women who had placentas weighing less than 500 g in 2 consecutive pregnancies , the risk of breast cancer was increased among women whose placentas weighed between 500 and 699 g in their first pregnancy and at least 700 g in their second pregnancy ( or vice versa ) ( adjusted hazard ratio , 1.82 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.07 - 3.08 ) , and the corresponding risk was doubled among women whose placentas weighed at least 700 g in both pregnancies ( adjusted hazard ratio , 2.05 ; 95 % CI , 1.15 - 3.64 ) .

167,"BACKGROUND Self-harm and suicide are common in prisoners , yet robust information on the full extent and characteristics of people at risk of self-harm is scant . Furthermore , understanding how frequently self-harm is followed by suicide , and in which prisoners this progression is most likely to happen , is important . We did a case-control study of all prisoners in England and Wales to ascertain the prevalence of self-harm in this population , associated risk factors , clustering effects , and risk of subsequent suicide after self-harm . METHODS Records of self-harm incidents in all prisons in England and Wales were gathered routinely between January , 2004 , and December , 2009 . We did a case-control comparison of prisoners who self-harmed and those who did not between January , 2006 , and December , 2009 . We also used a Bayesian approach to look at clustering of people who self-harmed . Prisoners who self-harmed and subsequently died by suicide in prison were compared with other inmates who self-harmed . FINDINGS 139,195 self-harm incidents were recorded in 26,510 individual prisoners between 2004 and 2009 ; 5 - 6 % of male prisoners and 20 - 24 % of female inmates self-harmed every year . Self-harm rates were more than ten times higher in female prisoners than in male inmates . Repetition of self-harm was common , particularly in women and teenage girls , in whom a subgroup of 102 prisoners accounted for 17,307 episodes . In both sexes , self-harm was associated with younger age , white ethnic origin , prison type , and a life sentence or being unsentenced ; in female inmates , committing a violent offence against an individual was also a factor . Substantial evidence was noted of clustering in time and location of prisoners who self-harmed ( adjusted intra-class correlation 0·15 , 95 % CI 0·11 - 0·18 ) . 109 subsequent suicides in prison were reported in individuals who self-harmed ; the risk was higher in those who self-harmed than in the general prison population , and more than half the deaths occurred within a month of self-harm . Risk factors for suicide after self-harm in male prisoners were older age and a previous self-harm incident of high or moderate lethality ; in female inmates , a history of more than five self-harm incidents within a year was associated with subsequent suicide . INTERPRETATION The burden of self-harm in prisoners is substantial , particularly in women . Self-harm in prison is associated with subsequent suicide in this setting . Prevention and treatment of self-harm in prisoners is an essential component of suicide prevention in prisons .

168,"BACKGROUND The prognosis and treatment of the 2 main types of cardiac amyloidosis , immunoglobulin light chain ( AL ) and transthyretin ( ATTR ) amyloidosis , are substantially influenced by cardiac involvement . Cardiovascular magnetic resonance with late gadolinium enhancement ( LGE ) is a reference standard for the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis , but its potential for stratifying risk is unknown . METHODS AND RESULTS Two hundred fifty prospectively recruited subjects , 122 patients with ATTR amyloid , 9 asymptomatic mutation carriers , and 119 patients with AL amyloidosis , underwent LGE cardiovascular magnetic resonance . Subjects were followed up for a mean of 24±13 months . LGE was performed with phase-sensitive inversion recovery ( PSIR ) and without ( magnitude only ) . These were compared with extracellular volume measured with T1 mapping . PSIR was superior to magnitude-only inversion recovery LGE because PSIR always nulled the tissue ( blood or myocardium ) with the longest T1 ( least gadolinium ) . LGE was classified into 3 patterns : none , subendocardial , and transmural , which were associated with increasing amyloid burden as defined by extracellular volume ( P<0.0001 ) , with transitions from none to subendocardial LGE at an extracellular volume of 0.40 to 0.43 ( AL ) and 0.39 to 0.40 ( ATTR ) and to transmural at 0.48 to 0.55 ( AL ) and 0.47 to 0.59 ( ATTR ) . Sixty-seven patients ( 27 % ) died . Transmural LGE predicted death ( hazard ratio , 5.4 ; 95 % confidence interval , 2.1 - 13.7 ; P<0.0001 ) and remained independent after adjustment for N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide , ejection fraction , stroke volume index , E/E ' , and left ventricular mass index ( hazard ratio , 4.1 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.3 - 13.1 ; P<0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS There is a continuum of cardiac involvement in systemic AL and ATTR amyloidosis . Transmural LGE is determined reliably by PSIR and represents advanced cardiac amyloidosis . The PSIR technique provides incremental information on outcome even after adjustment for known prognostic factors . [SEP] The severity of cardiac involvement in amyloidosis can be described by the degree of transmurality of late gadolinium enhancement in MRI.",SUPPORTS,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]"
169,"Molecular motors play critical roles in the formation of mitotic spindles , either through controlling the stability of individual microtubules , or by crosslinking and sliding microtubule arrays . Kinesin-8 motors are best known for their regulatory roles in controlling microtubule dynamics . They contain microtubule-destabilizing activities , and restrict spindle length in a wide variety of cell types and organisms . Here , we report an antiparallel microtubule-sliding activity of the budding yeast kinesin-8 , Kip3 . The in vivo importance of this sliding activity was established through the identification of complementary Kip3 mutants that separate the sliding activity and microtubule-destabilizing activity . In conjunction with Cin8 , a kinesin-5 family member , the sliding activity of Kip3 promotes bipolar spindle assembly and the maintenance of genome stability . We propose a slide-disassemble model where the sliding and destabilizing activity of Kip3 balance during pre-anaphase . This facilitates normal spindle assembly .

170,"The bacterial type VI secretion system ( T6SS ) is a large multicomponent , dynamic macromolecular machine that has an important role in the ecology of many Gram-negative bacteria . T6SS is responsible for translocation of a wide range of toxic effector molecules , allowing predatory cells to kill both prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic prey cells . The T6SS organelle is functionally analogous to contractile tails of bacteriophages and is thought to attack cells by initially penetrating them with a trimeric protein complex called the VgrG spike . Neither the exact protein composition of the T6SS organelle nor the mechanisms of effector selection and delivery are known . Here we report that proteins from the PAAR ( proline-alanine-alanine-arginine ) repeat superfamily form a sharp conical extension on the VgrG spike , which is further involved in attaching effector domains to the spike . The crystal structures of two PAAR-repeat proteins bound to VgrG-like partners show that these proteins sharpen the tip of the T6SS spike complex . We demonstrate that PAAR proteins are essential for T6SS-mediated secretion and target cell killing by Vibrio cholerae and Acinetobacter baylyi . Our results indicate a new model of the T6SS organelle in which the VgrG-PAAR spike complex is decorated with multiple effectors that are delivered simultaneously into target cells in a single contraction-driven translocation event .

171,"CONTEXT Recent animal studies have found that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A ( HMG-CoA ) lipid-lowering drugs ( statins ) substantially increase bone formation , but whether statin use in humans results in clinically meaningful bone formation or a reduction in the risk of osteoporotic fractures is not known . OBJECTIVE To determine whether the use of statins is associated with reduced hip fracture risk . DESIGN Case-control study . SETTING AND PATIENTS A total of 6110 New Jersey residents aged 65 years or older and enrolled in Medicare and either Medicaid or the Pharmacy Assistance for the Aged and Disabled program . Case patients ( n=1222 ) underwent surgical repair of a hip fracture in 1994 . Control patients ( n=4888 ) were identified at a ratio of 4:1 and frequency-matched to case patients for age and sex . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) of hip fracture by statin use in the 180 days and 3 years prior to the index date ( the earliest date of admission for surgery ) , adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics and health care utilization . RESULTS Use of statins in either the prior 180 days ( adjusted OR , 0.50 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.33 - 0.76 ) or prior 3 years ( adjusted OR , 0.57 ; 95 % CI , 0.40 - 0.82 ) was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of hip fracture , even after controlling for variables such as race , insurance status , psychoactive medications , estrogen and thiazide use , ischemic heart disease , cancer , and diabetes mellitus . No significant relationship was observed between use of nonstatin lipid-lowering agents and hip fracture risk . Clear relationships were observed between the degree of reduction in hip fracture risk and the extent of statin use ; there was no evidence of such relationships with nonstatin lipid-lowering agents . After adjusting for extent of statin use in the prior 3 years , current use ( on the index date ) was associated with a 71 % reduction in risk ( adjusted OR , 0.29 ; 95 % CI , 0.10 - 0.81 ) . The relationship between statin use and hip fracture risk persisted after controlling for variables such as the number of medications , the Charlson comorbidity index score , and hospitalization or nursing home stay in the last 180 days , as well as after excluding patients who were in a nursing home prior to their index date or who died in the year after their index date . Use of nonstatin lipid-lowering agents was not observed to be associated with reduction in hip fracture risk in any of these alternative models or analyses . CONCLUSIONS These findings support an association between statin use by elderly patients and reduction in the risk of hip fracture .

172,"BACKGROUND Deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) and pulmonary embolism are common after stroke . In small trials of patients undergoing surgery , graduated compression stockings ( GCS ) reduce the risk of DVT . National stroke guidelines extrapolating from these trials recommend their use in patients with stroke despite insufficient evidence . We assessed the effectiveness of thigh-length GCS to reduce DVT after stroke . METHODS In this outcome-blinded , randomised controlled trial , 2518 patients who were admitted to hospital within 1 week of an acute stroke and who were immobile were enrolled from 64 centres in the UK , Italy , and Australia . Patients were allocated via a central randomisation system to routine care plus thigh-length GCS ( n=1256 ) or to routine care plus avoidance of GCS ( n=1262 ) . A technician who was blinded to treatment allocation undertook compression Doppler ultrasound of both legs at about 7 - 10 days and , when practical , again at 25 - 30 days after enrolment . The primary outcome was the occurrence of symptomatic or asymptomatic DVT in the popliteal or femoral veins . Analyses were by intention to treat . This study is registered , number ISRCTN28163533 . FINDINGS All patients were included in the analyses . The primary outcome occurred in 126 ( 10.0 % ) patients allocated to thigh-length GCS and in 133 ( 10.5 % ) allocated to avoid GCS , resulting in a non-significant absolute reduction in risk of 0.5 % ( 95 % CI -1.9 % to 2.9 % ) . Skin breaks , ulcers , blisters , and skin necrosis were significantly more common in patients allocated to GCS than in those allocated to avoid their use ( 64 [ 5 % ] vs 16 [ 1 % ] ; odds ratio 4.18 , 95 % CI 2.40 - 7.27 ) . INTERPRETATION These data do not lend support to the use of thigh-length GCS in patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke .

173,"Limited neural input results in muscle weakness in neuromuscular disease because of a reduction in the density of muscle innervation , the rate of neuromuscular junction activation or the efficiency of synaptic transmission . We developed a small-molecule fast-skeletal-troponin activator , CK-2017357 , as a means to increase muscle strength by amplifying the response of muscle when neural input is otherwise diminished secondary to neuromuscular disease . Binding selectively to the fast-skeletal-troponin complex , CK-2017357 slows the rate of calcium release from troponin C and sensitizes muscle to calcium . As a consequence , the force-calcium relationship of muscle fibers shifts leftwards , as does the force-frequency relationship of a nerve-muscle pair , so that CK-2017357 increases the production of muscle force in situ at sub-maximal nerve stimulation rates . Notably , we show that sensitization of the fast-skeletal-troponin complex to calcium improves muscle force and grip strength immediately after administration of single doses of CK-2017357 in a model of the neuromuscular disease myasthenia gravis .

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials . DATA SOURCES Ovid Medline , Embase , and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to May 2012 , without restriction by language or publication status . REVIEW METHODS Randomised trials that compared ultrasound imaging with standard methods ( no imaging ) in the performance of a lumbar puncture or epidural catheterisation were identified . RESULTS 14 studies with a total of 1334 patients were included ( 674 patients assigned to the ultrasound group , 660 to the control group ) . Five studies evaluated lumbar punctures and nine evaluated epidural catheterisations . Six of 624 procedures conducted in the ultrasound group failed ; 44 of 610 procedures in the control group failed . Ultrasound imaging reduced the risk of failed procedures ( risk ratio 0.21 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.10 to 0.43 ) , P<0.001 ) . Risk reduction was similar when subgroup analysis was performed for lumbar punctures ( risk ratio 0.19 ( 0.07 to 0.56 ) , P=0.002 ) or epidural catheterisations ( 0.23 ( 0.09 to 0.60 ) , P=0.003 ) .

180,"West Nile virus ( WNV ) is the most common arthropod-borne flavivirus in the United States ; however , the vector ligand(s ) that participate in infection are not known . We now show that an Aedes aegypti C-type lectin , mosGCTL-1 , is induced by WNV , interacts with WNV in a calcium-dependent manner , and facilitates infection in vivo and in vitro . A mosquito homolog of human CD45 in A. aegypti , designated mosPTP-1 , recruits mosGCTL-1 to enable viral attachment to cells and to enhance viral entry . In vivo experiments show that mosGCTL-1 and mosPTP-1 function as part of the same pathway and are critical for WNV infection of mosquitoes . A similar phenomenon was also observed in Culex quinquefasciatus , a natural vector of WNV , further demonstrating that these genes participate in WNV infection .

181,"IMPORTANCE Combining pharmacotherapies for tobacco-dependence treatment may increase smoking abstinence . OBJECTIVE To determine efficacy and safety of varenicline and bupropion sustained-release ( SR ; combination therapy ) compared with varenicline ( monotherapy ) in cigarette smokers . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized , blinded , placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial with a 12-week treatment period and follow-up through week 52 conducted between October 2009 and April 2013 at 3 midwestern clinical research sites . Five hundred six adult ( ≥18 years ) cigarette smokers were randomly assigned and 315 ( 62 % ) completed the study . INTERVENTIONS Twelve weeks of varenicline and bupropion SR or varenicline and placebo . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was abstinence rates at week 12 , defined as prolonged ( no smoking from 2 weeks after the target quit date ) abstinence and 7-day point-prevalence ( no smoking past 7 days ) abstinence . Secondary outcomes were prolonged and point-prevalence smoking abstinence rates at weeks 26 and 52 . Outcomes were biochemically confirmed . RESULTS At 12 weeks , 53.0 % of the combination therapy group achieved prolonged smoking abstinence and 56.2 % achieved 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence compared with 43.2 % and 48.6 % in varenicline monotherapy ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 1.49 ; 95 % CI , 1.05 - 2.12 ; P = .03 and OR , 1.36 ; 95 % CI , 0.95 - 1.93 ; P = .09 , respectively ) . At 26 weeks , 36.6 % of the combination therapy group achieved prolonged and 38.2 % achieved 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence compared with 27.6 % and 31.9 % in varenicline monotherapy ( OR , 1.52 ; 95 % CI , 1.04 - 2.22 ; P = .03 and OR , 1.32 ; 95 % CI , 0.91 - 1.91 ; P = .14 , respectively ) . At 52 weeks , 30.9 % of the combination therapy group achieved prolonged and 36.6 % achieved 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence compared with 24.5 % and 29.2 % in varenicline monotherapy ( OR , 1.39 ; 95 % CI , 0.93 - 2.07 ; P = .11 and OR , 1.40 ; 95 % CI , 0.96 - 2.05 ; P = .08 , respectively ) . Participants receiving combination therapy reported more anxiety ( 7.2 % vs 3.1 % ; P = .04 ) and depressive symptoms ( 3.6 % vs 0.8 % ; P = .03 ) . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among cigarette smokers , combined use of varenicline and bupropion , compared with varenicline alone , increased prolonged abstinence but not 7-day point prevalence at 12 and 26 weeks . Neither outcome was significantly different at 52 weeks . Further research is required to determine the role of combination therapy in smoking cessation .

184,"BACKGROUND Birth size , perhaps a proxy for prenatal environment , might be a correlate of subsequent breast cancer risk , but findings from epidemiological studies have been inconsistent . We re-analysed individual participant data from published and unpublished studies to obtain more precise estimates of the magnitude and shape of the birth size-breast cancer association . METHODS AND FINDINGS Studies were identified through computer-assisted and manual searches , and personal communication with investigators . Individual participant data from 32 studies , comprising 22,058 breast cancer cases , were obtained . Random effect models were used , if appropriate , to combine study-specific estimates of effect . Birth weight was positively associated with breast cancer risk in studies based on birth records ( pooled relative risk [ RR ] per one standard deviation [ SD ] [ = 0.5 kg ] increment in birth weight : 1.06 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.02 - 1.09 ) and parental recall when the participants were children ( 1.02 ; 95 % CI 0.99 - 1.05 ) , but not in those based on adult self-reports , or maternal recall during the woman 's adulthood ( 0.98 ; 95 % CI 0.95 - 1.01 ) ( p for heterogeneity between data sources = 0.003 ) . Relative to women who weighed 3.000 - 3.499 kg , the risk was 0.96 ( CI 0.80 - 1.16 ) in those who weighed < 2.500 kg , and 1.12 ( 95 % CI 1.00 - 1.25 ) in those who weighed > or = 4.000 kg ( p for linear trend = 0.001 ) in birth record data . Birth length and head circumference from birth records were also positively associated with breast cancer risk ( pooled RR per one SD increment : 1.06 [ 95 % CI 1.03 - 1.10 ] and 1.09 [ 95 % CI 1.03 - 1.15 ] , respectively ) . Simultaneous adjustment for these three birth size variables showed that length was the strongest independent predictor of risk . The birth size effects did not appear to be confounded or mediated by established breast cancer risk factors and were not modified by age or menopausal status . The cumulative incidence of breast cancer per 100 women by age 80 y in the study populations was estimated to be 10.0 , 10.0 , 10.4 , and 11.5 in those who were , respectively , in the bottom , second , third , and top fourths of the birth length distribution . CONCLUSIONS This pooled analysis of individual participant data is consistent with birth size , and in particular birth length , being an independent correlate of breast cancer risk in adulthood . INTRODUCTION Various perinatal factors , including birth weight , birth order , maternal age , gestational age , twin status , and parental smoking , have been postulated to affect breast cancer risk in daughters by altering the hormonal environment of the developing fetal mammary glands . Despite ample biologic plausibility , epidemiologic studies to date have yielded conflicting results . We investigated the associations between perinatal factors and subsequent breast cancer risk through meta-analyses . METHODS We reviewed breast cancer studies published from January 1966 to February 2007 that included data on birth weight , birth order , maternal age , gestational age , twin status , and maternal or paternal smoking . Meta-analyses using random effect models were employed to summarize the results . RESULTS We found that heavier birth weights were associated with increased breast cancer risk , with studies involving five categories of birth weight identifying odds ratios ( ORs ) of 1.24 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.04 to 1.48 ) for 4,000 g or more and 1.15 ( 95 % CI 1.04 to 1.26 ) for 3,500 g to 3,999 g , relative to a birth weight of 2,500 to 2,599 g. These studies provided no support for a J-shaped relationship of birthweight to risk . Support for an association with birthweight was also derived from studies based on three birth weight categories ( OR 1.15 [ 95 % CI 1.01 to 1.31 ] for > or = 4,000 g relative to < 3,000 g ) and two birth weight categories ( OR 1.09 [ 95 % CI 1.02 to 1.18 ] for > or = 3,000 g relative to < 3,000 g ) . Women born to older mothers and twins were also at some increased risk , but the results were heterogeneous across studies and publication years . Birth order , prematurity , and maternal smoking were unrelated to breast cancer risk . CONCLUSION Our findings provide some support for the hypothesis that in utero exposures reflective of higher endogenous hormone levels could affect risk for development of breast cancer in adulthood . BACKGROUND Emerging evidence suggests an association between female prenatal experience and her subsequent risk of developing breast cancer . Potential underlying mechanisms include variation in amounts of maternal endogenous sex hormones and growth hormones , germ-cell mutations , formation of cancer stem-cells , and other genetic or epigenetic events . We reviewed and summarised quantitatively the available data on intrauterine exposures and risk of breast cancer . METHODS We systematically searched for studies that assessed association between perinatal factors and risk of breast cancer . We reviewed separately each of the perinatal factors , including birthweight , birth length , parental age at delivery , gestational age , intrauterine exposure to diethylstilbestrol , twin membership , maternal pre-eclampsia or eclampsia , and other factors . FINDINGS We identified 57 studies published between Oct 1 , 1980 , and June 21 , 2007 . Increased risk of breast cancer was noted with increased birthweight ( relative risk [ RR ] 1.15 [ 95 % CI 1.09 - 1.21 ] ) , birth length ( 1.28 [ 1.11 - 1.48 ] ) , higher maternal age ( 1.13 [ 1.02 - 1.25 ] ) , and paternal age ( 1.12 [ 1.05 - 1.19 ] ) . Decreased risk of breast cancer was noted for maternal pre-eclampsia and eclampsia ( 0.48 [ 0.30 - 0.78 ] ) and twin membership ( 0.93 [ 0.87 - 1.00 ] ) . No association was noted between risk of breast cancer and gestational age at birth ( 0.95 [ 0.71 - 1.26 ] ) or maternal diethylstilbestrol treatment ( 1.40 [ 0.86 - 2.28 ] ) . INTERPRETATION The intrauterine environment contributes to the predisposition of women to breast cancer in adulthood . The in-utero mechanisms responsible for such predisposition need to be elucidated . Breast cancer may originate in utero . We reviewed the available evidence on the association between birthweight and the risk of breast cancer . To date , 26 research papers addressing this issue have been published . The majority of studies identified a positive link between birthweight and premenopausal , but not postmenopausal , breast cancer . The relative risk estimate for breast cancer comparing women with high birthweight to women with low birthweight combining all studies including both pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer was 1.23 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.13 - 1.34 ) . The mechanisms underlying this association likely include elevated levels of growth factors that may increase the number of susceptible stem cells in the mammary gland or initiate tumors through DNA mutations . Loss of imprinting ( LOI ) of growth hormone genes relevant for intrauterine growth , such as insulin-like growth factor 2 ( IGF2 ) , leads to abnormally high levels of these hormones evidenced by high birthweight .

PKCζ represses the expression of two key enzymes of the pathway , PHGDH and PSAT1 , and phosphorylates PHGDH at key residues to inhibit its enzymatic activity .
