0,"Having a main partner improves HIV outcomes. [SEP] OBJECTIVES To explore the association between a stable partnership and clinical outcome in HIV infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) . DESIGN Prospective cohort study of adults with HIV ( Swiss HIV cohort study ) . SETTING Seven outpatient clinics throughout Switzerland . PARTICIPANTS The 3736 patients in the cohort who started HAART before 2002 ( median age 36 years , 29 % female , median follow up 3.6 years ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Time to AIDS or death ( primary endpoint ) , death alone , increases in CD4 cell count of at least 50 and 100 above baseline , optimal viral suppression ( a viral load below 400 copies/ml ) , and viral rebound . RESULTS During follow up 2985 ( 80 % ) participants reported a stable partnership on at least one occasion . When starting HAART , 52 % ( 545/1042 ) of participants reported a stable partnership ; after five years of follow up 46 % ( 190/412 ) of participants reported a stable partnership . In an analysis stratified by previous antiretroviral therapy and clinical stage when starting HAART ( US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention group A , B , or C ) , the adjusted hazard ratio for progression to AIDS or death was 0.79 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.63 to 0.98 ) for participants with a stable partnership compared with those without . Adjusted hazards ratios for other endpoints were 0.59 ( 0.44 to 0.79 ) for progression to death , 1.15 ( 1.06 to 1.24 ) for an increase in CD4 cells of 100 counts/microl or more , and 1.06 ( 0.98 to 1.14 ) for optimal viral suppression .

1,"Omnivores produce more trimethylamine N-oxide from dietary I-carnitine than vegetarians. [SEP] Intestinal microbiota metabolism of choline and phosphatidylcholine produces trimethylamine ( TMA ) , which is further metabolized to a proatherogenic species , trimethylamine-N-oxide ( TMAO ) . We demonstrate here that metabolism by intestinal microbiota of dietary L-carnitine , a trimethylamine abundant in red meat , also produces TMAO and accelerates atherosclerosis in mice . Omnivorous human subjects produced more TMAO than did vegans or vegetarians following ingestion of L-carnitine through a microbiota-dependent mechanism . The presence of specific bacterial taxa in human feces was associated with both plasma TMAO concentration and dietary status . Plasma L-carnitine levels in subjects undergoing cardiac evaluation ( n = 2,595 ) predicted increased risks for both prevalent cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) and incident major adverse cardiac events ( myocardial infarction , stroke or death ) , but only among subjects with concurrently high TMAO levels . Chronic dietary L-carnitine supplementation in mice altered cecal microbial composition , markedly enhanced synthesis of TMA and TMAO , and increased atherosclerosis , but this did not occur if intestinal microbiota was concurrently suppressed . In mice with an intact intestinal microbiota , dietary supplementation with TMAO or either carnitine or choline reduced in vivo reverse cholesterol transport . Intestinal microbiota may thus contribute to the well-established link between high levels of red meat consumption and CVD risk .

2,"Nonsteroidal antinflammatory drugs are ineffective as cancer treatments. [SEP] IMPORTANCE Use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) is associated with lower risk of colorectal cancer . OBJECTIVE To identify common genetic markers that may confer differential benefit from aspirin or NSAID chemoprevention , we tested gene × environment interactions between regular use of aspirin and/or NSAIDs and single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in relation to risk of colorectal cancer . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Case-control study using data from 5 case-control and 5 cohort studies initiated between 1976 and 2003 across the United States , Canada , Australia , and Germany and including colorectal cancer cases ( n=8634 ) and matched controls ( n=8553 ) ascertained between 1976 and 2011 . Participants were all of European descent . EXPOSURES Genome-wide SNP data and information on regular use of aspirin and/or NSAIDs and other risk factors . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Colorectal cancer . RESULTS Regular use of aspirin and/or NSAIDs was associated with lower risk of colorectal cancer ( prevalence , 28 % vs 38 % ; odds ratio [ OR ] , 0.69 [ 95 % CI , 0.64 - 0.74 ] ; P = 6.2 × 10(-28 ) ) compared with nonregular use . In the conventional logistic regression analysis , the SNP rs2965667 at chromosome 12p12.3 near the MGST1 gene showed a genome-wide significant interaction with aspirin and/or NSAID use ( P = 4.6 × 10(-9 ) for interaction ) . Aspirin and/or NSAID use was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer among individuals with rs2965667-TT genotype ( prevalence , 28 % vs 38 % ; OR , 0.66 [ 95 % CI , 0.61 - 0.70 ] ; P = 7.7 × 10(-33 ) ) but with a higher risk among those with rare ( 4 % ) TA or AA genotypes ( prevalence , 35 % vs 29 % ; OR , 1.89 [ 95 % CI , 1.27 - 2.81 ] ; P = .002 ) . In case-only interaction analysis , the SNP rs16973225 at chromosome 15q25.2 near the IL16 gene showed a genome-wide significant interaction with use of aspirin and/or NSAIDs ( P = 8.2 × 10(-9 ) for interaction ) . Regular use was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer among individuals with rs16973225-AA genotype ( prevalence , 28 % vs 38 % ; OR , 0.66 [ 95 % CI , 0.62 - 0.71 ] ; P = 1.9 × 10(-30 ) ) but was not associated with risk of colorectal cancer among those with less common ( 9 % ) AC or CC genotypes ( prevalence , 36 % vs 39 % ; OR , 0.97 [ 95 % CI , 0.78 - 1.20 ] ; P = .76 ) . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this genome-wide investigation of gene × environment interactions , use of aspirin and/or NSAIDs was associated with lower risk of colorectal cancer , and this association differed according to genetic variation at 2 SNPs at chromosomes 12 and 15 . Validation of these findings in additional populations may facilitate targeted colorectal cancer prevention strategies .

3,"Patients with common epithelial cancers are less likely to have an emergency event as their first hospital admission if they live in resource-deprived areas. [SEP] OBJECTIVES To determine the extent to which type of hospital admission ( emergency compared with elective ) and surgical procedure varied by socioeconomic circumstances , age , sex , and year of admission for colorectal , breast , and lung cancer . DESIGN Repeated cross sectional study with data from individual patients , 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2006 . SETTING Hospital episode statistics ( HES ) dataset . PARTICIPANTS 564 821 patients aged 50 and over admitted with a diagnosis of colorectal , breast , or lung cancer . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Proportion of patients admitted as emergencies , and the proportion receiving the recommended surgical treatment . RESULTS Patients from deprived areas , older people , and women were more likely to be admitted as emergencies . For example , the adjusted odds ratio for patients with breast cancer in the least compared with most deprived fifth of deprivation was 0.63 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.60 to 0.66 ) and the adjusted odds ratio for patients with lung cancer aged 80 - 89 compared with those aged 50 - 59 was 3.13 ( 2.93 to 3.34 ) . There were some improvements in disparities between age groups but not for patients living in deprived areas over time . Patients from deprived areas were less likely to receive preferred procedures for rectal , breast , and lung cancer . These findings did not improve with time . For example , 67.4 % ( 3529/5237 ) of patients in the most deprived fifth of deprivation had anterior resection for rectal cancer compared with 75.5 % ( 4497/5959 ) of patients in the least deprived fifth ( 1.34 , 1.22 to 1.47 ) . Over half ( 54.0 % , 11 256/20 849 ) of patients in the most deprived fifth of deprivation had breast conserving surgery compared with 63.7 % ( 18 445/28 960 ) of patients in the least deprived fifth ( 1.21 , 1.16 to 1.26 ) . Men were less likely than women to undergo anterior resection and lung cancer resection and older people were less likely to receive breast conserving surgery and lung cancer resection . For example , the adjusted odds ratio for lung cancer patients aged 80 - 89 compared with those aged 50 - 59 was 0.52 ( 0.46 to 0.59 ) .

5,"miR-142-5P is a temperature-sensitive microRNA (miRNA). [SEP] Fever is commonly used to diagnose disease and is consistently associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients . However , the molecular controls of elevated body temperature are poorly understood . We discovered that the expression of RNA-binding motif protein 3 ( RBM3 ) , known to respond to cold stress and to modulate microRNA ( miRNA ) expression , was reduced in 30 patients with fever , and in THP-1-derived macrophages maintained at a fever-like temperature ( 40 ° C ) . Notably , RBM3 expression is reduced during fever whether or not infection is demonstrable . Reduced RBM3 expression resulted in increased expression of RBM3-targeted temperature-sensitive miRNAs , we termed thermomiRs . ThermomiRs such as miR-142 - 5p and miR-143 in turn target endogenous pyrogens including IL-6 , IL6ST , TLR2 , PGE2 and TNF to complete a negative feedback mechanism , which may be crucial to prevent pathological hyperthermia . Using normal PBMCs that were exogenously exposed to fever-like temperature ( 40 ° C ) , we further demonstrate the trend by which decreased levels of RBM3 were associated with increased levels of miR-142 - 5p and miR-143 and vice versa over a 24 h time course .

7,"Kir7.1 modulates channel activity by the G protein-coupled melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. [SEP] The regulated release of anorexigenic α-melanocyte stimulating hormone ( α-MSH ) and orexigenic Agouti-related protein ( AgRP ) from discrete hypothalamic arcuate neurons onto common target sites in the central nervous system has a fundamental role in the regulation of energy homeostasis . Both peptides bind with high affinity to the melanocortin-4 receptor ( MC4R ) ; existing data show that α-MSH is an agonist that couples the receptor to the Gαs signalling pathway , while AgRP binds competitively to block α-MSH binding and blocks the constitutive activity mediated by the ligand-mimetic amino-terminal domain of the receptor . Here we show that , in mice , regulation of firing activity of neurons from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus ( PVN ) by α-MSH and AgRP can be mediated independently of Gαs signalling by ligand-induced coupling of MC4R to closure of inwardly rectifying potassium channel , Kir7.1 . Furthermore , AgRP is a biased agonist that hyperpolarizes neurons by binding to MC4R and opening Kir7.1 , independently of its inhibition of α-MSH binding . Consequently , Kir7.1 signalling appears to be central to melanocortin-mediated regulation of energy homeostasis within the PVN . Coupling of MC4R to Kir7.1 may explain unusual aspects of the control of energy homeostasis by melanocortin signalling , including the gene dosage effect of MC4R and the sustained effects of AgRP on food intake .

8,"A deficiency of folate increases blood levels of homocysteine. [SEP] BACKGROUND Lowering serum homocysteine levels with folic acid is expected to reduce mortality from ischemic heart disease . Homocysteine reduction is known to be maximal at a folic acid dosage of 1 mg/d , but the effect of lower doses ( relevant to food fortification ) is unclear . METHODS We randomized 151 patients with ischemic heart disease to 1 of 5 dosages of folic acid ( 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.8 , and 1.0 mg/d ) or placebo . Fasting blood samples for serum homocysteine and serum folate analysis were taken initially , after 3 months of supplementation , and 3 months after folic acid use was discontinued . RESULTS Median serum homocysteine level decreased with increasing folic acid dosage , to a maximum at 0.8 mg of folic acid per day , when the homocysteine reduction ( placebo adjusted ) was 2.7 micromol/L ( 23 % ) , similar to the known effect of folic acid dosages of 1 mg/d and above . The higher a person 's initial serum homocysteine level , the greater was the response to folic acid , but there were statistically significant reductions regardless of the initial level . Serum folate level increased approximately linearly ( 5.5 nmol/L for every 0.1 mg of folic acid ) . Within-person fluctuations over time in serum homocysteine levels , measured in the placebo group , were large compared with the effect of folic acid , indicating that monitoring of the reduction in an individual is impractical . CONCLUSIONS A dosage of folic acid of 0.8 mg/d appears necessary to achieve the maximum reduction in serum homocysteine level across the range of homocysteine levels in the population . Current US food fortification levels will achieve only a small proportion of the achievable homocysteine reduction .

10,"IFI16 impedes STING phosphorylation and translocation, resulting in reduced activation of STING. [SEP] Many human cells can sense the presence of exogenous DNA during infection though the cytosolic DNA receptor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase ( cGAS ) , which produces the second messenger cyclic GMP-AMP ( cGAMP ) . Other putative DNA receptors have been described , but whether their functions are redundant , tissue-specific or integrated in the cGAS-cGAMP pathway is unclear . Here we show that interferon-γ inducible protein 16 ( IFI16 ) cooperates with cGAS during DNA sensing in human keratinocytes , as both cGAS and IFI16 are required for the full activation of an innate immune response to exogenous DNA and DNA viruses . IFI16 is also required for the cGAMP-induced activation of STING , and interacts with STING to promote STING phosphorylation and translocation . We propose that the two DNA sensors IFI16 and cGAS cooperate to prevent the spurious activation of the type I interferon response .

11,"MafA phosphorylation enhances its ubiquitination. [SEP] The Maf oncoproteins are b-Zip transcription factors of the AP-1 superfamily . They are involved in developmental , metabolic , and tumorigenic processes . Maf proteins are overexpressed in about 50 % of human multiple myelomas . Here , we show that Maf-transforming activity is controlled by GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation and that phosphorylation by GSK-3 can increase the oncogenic activity of a protein . Using microarray analysis , we identify a gene-expression subprogram regulated by GSK-3-mediated Maf phosphorylation involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and relevant to cancer progression . We also demonstrate that GSK-3 triggers MafA sequential phosphorylation on residues S61 , T57 , T53 , and S49 , inducing its ubiquitination and degradation . Paradoxically , this phosphorylation increases MafA-transcriptional activity through the recruitment of the coactivator P/CAF . We further demonstrate that P/CAF protects MafA from ubiquitination and degradation , suggesting that , upon the release of the coactivator complex , MafA becomes polyubiquitinated and degraded to allow the response to terminate .

Factors that predict macrosomia are poorly understood . The increased rate of macrosomia in the offspring of pregnant women with diabetes and in congenital hyperinsulinaemia is mediated by increased foetal insulin secretion .

13,"Propriospinal interneurons that play a role in the plastic reorganization of spinal circuits are integral for recovery from spinal cord injury. [SEP] Spinal cord injuries ( SCIs ) in humans and experimental animals are often associated with varying degrees of spontaneous functional recovery during the first months after injury . Such recovery is widely attributed to axons spared from injury that descend from the brain and bypass incomplete lesions , but its mechanisms are uncertain . To investigate the neural basis of spontaneous recovery , we used kinematic , physiological and anatomical analyses to evaluate mice with various combinations of spatially and temporally separated lateral hemisections with or without the excitotoxic ablation of intrinsic spinal cord neurons . We show that propriospinal relay connections that bypass one or more injury sites are able to mediate spontaneous functional recovery and supraspinal control of stepping , even when there has been essentially total and irreversible interruption of long descending supraspinal pathways in mice . Our findings show that pronounced functional recovery can occur after severe SCI without the maintenance or regeneration of direct projections from the brain past the lesion and can be mediated by the reorganization of descending and propriospinal connections . Targeting interventions toward augmenting the remodeling of relay connections may provide new therapeutic strategies to bypass lesions and restore function after SCI and in other conditions such as stroke and multiple sclerosis .

[SEP] OBJECTIVE To evaluate if a specific exercise strategy , targeting the rotator cuff and scapula stabilisers , improves shoulder function and pain more than unspecific exercises in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome , thereby decreasing the need for arthroscopic subacromial decompression . DESIGN Randomised , participant and single assessor blinded , controlled study . SETTING Department of orthopaedics in a Swedish university hospital . PARTICIPANTS 102 patients with long standing ( over six months ) persistent subacromial impingement syndrome in whom earlier conservative treatment had failed , recruited through orthopaedic specialists . INTERVENTIONS The specific exercise strategy consisted of strengthening eccentric exercises for the rotator cuff and concentric/eccentric exercises for the scapula stabilisers in combination with manual mobilisation . The control exercise programme consisted of unspecific movement exercises for the neck and shoulder . Patients in both groups received five to six individual guided treatment sessions during 12 weeks . In between these supervised sessions the participants performed home exercises once or twice a day for 12 weeks . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the Constant-Murley shoulder assessment score evaluating shoulder function and pain . Secondary outcomes were patients ' global impression of change because of treatment and decision regarding surgery . RESULTS Most ( 97 , 95 % ) participants completed the 12 week study . There was a significantly greater improvement in the Constant-Murley score in the specific exercise group than in the control exercise group ( 24 points ( 95 % confidence interval 19 to 28.0 ) v 9 points ( 5 to 13 ) ; mean difference between group : 15 points ( 8.5 to 20.6 ) ) . Significantly more patients in the specific exercise group reported successful outcome ( defined as large improvement or recovered ) in the patients ' global assessment of change because of treatment : 69 % ( 35/51 ) v 24 % ( 11/46 ) ; odds ratio 7.6 , 3.1 to 18.9 ; P<0.001 .

DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Cohort and nested case-control analyses among persons with diabetes . A bladder cancer cohort followed 193,099 persons aged 40 years or older in 1997 - 2002 until December 2012 ; 464 case patients and 464 matched controls were surveyed about additional confounders . A cohort analysis of 10 additional cancers included 236,507 persons aged 40 years or older in 1997 - 2005 and followed until June 2012 . Cohorts were from Kaiser Permanente Northern California . EXPOSURES Ever use , duration , cumulative dose , and time since initiation of pioglitazone as time dependent . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident cancer , including bladder , prostate , female breast , lung/bronchus , endometrial , colon , non-Hodgkin lymphoma , pancreas , kidney/renal pelvis , rectum , and melanoma . RESULTS Among 193,099 persons in the bladder cancer cohort , 34,181 ( 18 % ) received pioglitazone ( median duration , 2.8 years ; range , 0.2 - 13.2 years ) and 1261 had incident bladder cancer . Crude incidences of bladder cancer in pioglitazone users and nonusers were 89.8 and 75.9 per 100,000 person-years , respectively . Ever use of pioglitazone was not associated with bladder cancer risk ( adjusted hazard ratio [ HR ] , 1.06 ; 95 % CI , 0.89 - 1.26 ) . Results were similar in case-control analyses ( pioglitazone use : 19.6 % among case patients and 17.5 % among controls ; adjusted odds ratio , 1.18 ; 95 % CI , 0.78 - 1.80 ) . In adjusted analyses , there was no association with 8 of the 10 additional cancers ; ever use of pioglitazone was associated with increased risk of prostate cancer ( HR , 1.13 ; 95 % CI , 1.02 - 1.26 ) and pancreatic cancer ( HR , 1.41 ; 95 % CI , 1.16 - 1.71 ) . Crude incidences of prostate and pancreatic cancer in pioglitazone users vs nonusers were 453.3 vs 449.3 and 81.1 vs 48.4 per 100,000 person-years , respectively . No clear patterns of risk for any cancer were observed for time since initiation , duration , or dose .

17,"Birth-weight is negatively associated with breast cancer. [SEP] BACKGROUND Birth size , perhaps a proxy for prenatal environment , might be a correlate of subsequent breast cancer risk , but findings from epidemiological studies have been inconsistent . We re-analysed individual participant data from published and unpublished studies to obtain more precise estimates of the magnitude and shape of the birth size-breast cancer association . METHODS AND FINDINGS Studies were identified through computer-assisted and manual searches , and personal communication with investigators . Individual participant data from 32 studies , comprising 22,058 breast cancer cases , were obtained . Random effect models were used , if appropriate , to combine study-specific estimates of effect . Birth weight was positively associated with breast cancer risk in studies based on birth records ( pooled relative risk [ RR ] per one standard deviation [ SD ] [ = 0.5 kg ] increment in birth weight : 1.06 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.02 - 1.09 ) and parental recall when the participants were children ( 1.02 ; 95 % CI 0.99 - 1.05 ) , but not in those based on adult self-reports , or maternal recall during the woman 's adulthood ( 0.98 ; 95 % CI 0.95 - 1.01 ) ( p for heterogeneity between data sources = 0.003 ) . Relative to women who weighed 3.000 - 3.499 kg , the risk was 0.96 ( CI 0.80 - 1.16 ) in those who weighed < 2.500 kg , and 1.12 ( 95 % CI 1.00 - 1.25 ) in those who weighed > or = 4.000 kg ( p for linear trend = 0.001 ) in birth record data . Birth length and head circumference from birth records were also positively associated with breast cancer risk ( pooled RR per one SD increment : 1.06 [ 95 % CI 1.03 - 1.10 ] and 1.09 [ 95 % CI 1.03 - 1.15 ] , respectively ) . Simultaneous adjustment for these three birth size variables showed that length was the strongest independent predictor of risk . The birth size effects did not appear to be confounded or mediated by established breast cancer risk factors and were not modified by age or menopausal status . The cumulative incidence of breast cancer per 100 women by age 80 y in the study populations was estimated to be 10.0 , 10.0 , 10.4 , and 11.5 in those who were , respectively , in the bottom , second , third , and top fourths of the birth length distribution . CONCLUSIONS This pooled analysis of individual participant data is consistent with birth size , and in particular birth length , being an independent correlate of breast cancer risk in adulthood . INTRODUCTION Various perinatal factors , including birth weight , birth order , maternal age , gestational age , twin status , and parental smoking , have been postulated to affect breast cancer risk in daughters by altering the hormonal environment of the developing fetal mammary glands . Despite ample biologic plausibility , epidemiologic studies to date have yielded conflicting results . We investigated the associations between perinatal factors and subsequent breast cancer risk through meta-analyses . METHODS We reviewed breast cancer studies published from January 1966 to February 2007 that included data on birth weight , birth order , maternal age , gestational age , twin status , and maternal or paternal smoking . Meta-analyses using random effect models were employed to summarize the results . RESULTS We found that heavier birth weights were associated with increased breast cancer risk , with studies involving five categories of birth weight identifying odds ratios ( ORs ) of 1.24 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.04 to 1.48 ) for 4,000 g or more and 1.15 ( 95 % CI 1.04 to 1.26 ) for 3,500 g to 3,999 g , relative to a birth weight of 2,500 to 2,599 g. These studies provided no support for a J-shaped relationship of birthweight to risk . Support for an association with birthweight was also derived from studies based on three birth weight categories ( OR 1.15 [ 95 % CI 1.01 to 1.31 ] for > or = 4,000 g relative to < 3,000 g ) and two birth weight categories ( OR 1.09 [ 95 % CI 1.02 to 1.18 ] for > or = 3,000 g relative to < 3,000 g ) . Women born to older mothers and twins were also at some increased risk , but the results were heterogeneous across studies and publication years . Birth order , prematurity , and maternal smoking were unrelated to breast cancer risk . CONCLUSION Our findings provide some support for the hypothesis that in utero exposures reflective of higher endogenous hormone levels could affect risk for development of breast cancer in adulthood . BACKGROUND Emerging evidence suggests an association between female prenatal experience and her subsequent risk of developing breast cancer . Potential underlying mechanisms include variation in amounts of maternal endogenous sex hormones and growth hormones , germ-cell mutations , formation of cancer stem-cells , and other genetic or epigenetic events . We reviewed and summarised quantitatively the available data on intrauterine exposures and risk of breast cancer . METHODS We systematically searched for studies that assessed association between perinatal factors and risk of breast cancer . We reviewed separately each of the perinatal factors , including birthweight , birth length , parental age at delivery , gestational age , intrauterine exposure to diethylstilbestrol , twin membership , maternal pre-eclampsia or eclampsia , and other factors . FINDINGS We identified 57 studies published between Oct 1 , 1980 , and June 21 , 2007 . Increased risk of breast cancer was noted with increased birthweight ( relative risk [ RR ] 1.15 [ 95 % CI 1.09 - 1.21 ] ) , birth length ( 1.28 [ 1.11 - 1.48 ] ) , higher maternal age ( 1.13 [ 1.02 - 1.25 ] ) , and paternal age ( 1.12 [ 1.05 - 1.19 ] ) . Decreased risk of breast cancer was noted for maternal pre-eclampsia and eclampsia ( 0.48 [ 0.30 - 0.78 ] ) and twin membership ( 0.93 [ 0.87 - 1.00 ] ) . No association was noted between risk of breast cancer and gestational age at birth ( 0.95 [ 0.71 - 1.26 ] ) or maternal diethylstilbestrol treatment ( 1.40 [ 0.86 - 2.28 ] ) . INTERPRETATION The intrauterine environment contributes to the predisposition of women to breast cancer in adulthood . The in-utero mechanisms responsible for such predisposition need to be elucidated . Breast cancer may originate in utero . We reviewed the available evidence on the association between birthweight and the risk of breast cancer . To date , 26 research papers addressing this issue have been published . The majority of studies identified a positive link between birthweight and premenopausal , but not postmenopausal , breast cancer . The relative risk estimate for breast cancer comparing women with high birthweight to women with low birthweight combining all studies including both pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer was 1.23 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.13 - 1.34 ) . The mechanisms underlying this association likely include elevated levels of growth factors that may increase the number of susceptible stem cells in the mammary gland or initiate tumors through DNA mutations . Loss of imprinting ( LOI ) of growth hormone genes relevant for intrauterine growth , such as insulin-like growth factor 2 ( IGF2 ) , leads to abnormally high levels of these hormones evidenced by high birthweight . LOI of IGF2 has also been found in mammary tumor tissue . The role of environmental factors that stimulate such epigenetic regulation of gene expression remains to be elucidated .

It acts as a key downstream target of both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and γ , the agonists of which have been used for lipid lowering and insulin sensitization , respectively . However , the role of FGF21 in the cardiovascular system remains elusive . METHODS AND RESULTS The roles of FGF21 in atherosclerosis were investigated by evaluating the impact of FGF21 deficiency and replenishment with recombinant FGF21 in apolipoprotein E(-/- ) mice . FGF21 deficiency causes a marked exacerbation of atherosclerotic plaque formation and premature death in apolipoprotein E(-/- ) mice , which is accompanied by hypoadiponectinemia and severe hypercholesterolemia . Replenishment of FGF21 protects against atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E(-/-)mice via 2 independent mechanisms , inducing the adipocyte production of adiponectin , which in turn acts on the blood vessels to inhibit neointima formation and macrophage inflammation , and suppressing the hepatic expression of the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 , thereby leading to reduced cholesterol synthesis and attenuation of hypercholesterolemia . Chronic treatment with adiponectin partially reverses atherosclerosis without obvious effects on hypercholesterolemia in FGF21-deficient apolipoprotein E(-/- ) mice . By contrast , the cholesterol-lowering effects of FGF21 are abrogated by hepatic expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 . CONCLUSIONS FGF21 protects against atherosclerosis via fine tuning the multiorgan crosstalk among liver , adipose tissue , and blood vessels .

19,"Differentiation of progenitor cells to myeloid cells is skewed when insulin signaling is suppressed. [SEP] The Drosophila lymph gland is a haematopoietic organ in which progenitor cells , which are most akin to the common myeloid progenitor in mammals , proliferate and differentiate into three types of mature cell -- plasmatocytes , crystal cells and lamellocytes -- the functions of which are reminiscent of mammalian myeloid cells . During the first and early second instars of larval development , the lymph gland contains only progenitors , whereas in the third instar , a medial region of the primary lobe of the lymph gland called the medullary zone contains these progenitors , and maturing blood cells are found juxtaposed in a peripheral region designated the cortical zone . A third group of cells referred to as the posterior signalling centre functions as a haematopoietic niche . Similarly to mammalian myeloid cells , Drosophila blood cells respond to multiple stresses including hypoxia , infection and oxidative stress . However , how systemic signals are sensed by myeloid progenitors to regulate cell-fate determination has not been well described . Here , we show that the haematopoietic progenitors of Drosophila are direct targets of systemic ( insulin ) and nutritional ( essential amino acid ) signals , and that these systemic signals maintain the progenitors by promoting Wingless ( WNT in mammals ) signalling . We expect that this study will promote investigation of such possible direct signal sensing mechanisms by mammalian myeloid progenitors .

20,"Increased LDL receptors plays a role in the reduction of plasma Lp(a). [SEP] BACKGROUND Alirocumab , a monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 ( PCSK9 ) , lowers plasma low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol and apolipoprotein B100 ( apoB ) . Although studies in mice and cells have identified increased hepatic LDL receptors as the basis for LDL lowering by PCSK9 inhibitors , there have been no human studies characterizing the effects of PCSK9 inhibitors on lipoprotein metabolism . In particular , it is not known whether inhibition of PCSK9 has any effects on very low-density lipoprotein or intermediate-density lipoprotein ( IDL ) metabolism . Inhibition of PCSK9 also results in reductions of plasma lipoprotein ( a ) levels . The regulation of plasma Lp(a ) levels , including the role of LDL receptors in the clearance of Lp(a ) , is poorly defined , and no mechanistic studies of the Lp(a ) lowering by alirocumab in humans have been published to date . METHODS Eighteen ( 10 F , 8 mol/L ) participants completed a placebo-controlled , 2-period study . They received 2 doses of placebo , 2 weeks apart , followed by 5 doses of 150 mg of alirocumab , 2 weeks apart . At the end of each period , fractional clearance rates ( FCRs ) and production rates ( PRs ) of apoB and apo(a ) were determined . In 10 participants , postprandial triglycerides and apoB48 levels were measured . RESULTS Alirocumab reduced ultracentrifugally isolated LDL-C by 55.1 % , LDL-apoB by 56.3 % , and plasma Lp(a ) by 18.7 % . The fall in LDL-apoB was caused by an 80.4 % increase in LDL-apoB FCR and a 23.9 % reduction in LDL-apoB PR . The latter was due to a 46.1 % increase in IDL-apoB FCR coupled with a 27.2 % decrease in conversion of IDL to LDL . The FCR of apo(a ) tended to increase ( 24.6 % ) without any change in apo(a ) PR . Alirocumab had no effects on FCRs or PRs of very low-density lipoproteins-apoB and very low-density lipoproteins triglycerides or on postprandial plasma triglycerides or apoB48 concentrations . CONCLUSIONS Alirocumab decreased LDL-C and LDL-apoB by increasing IDL- and LDL-apoB FCRs and decreasing LDL-apoB PR . These results are consistent with increases in LDL receptors available to clear IDL and LDL from blood during PCSK9 inhibition . The increase in apo(a ) FCR during alirocumab treatment suggests that increased LDL receptors may also play a role in the reduction of plasma Lp(a ) .

22,"Interleukin-18 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. [SEP] Interleukin-18 ( IL18 ) participates in atherogenesis through several putative mechanisms . Interruption of IL18 action reduces atherosclerosis in mice . Here , we show that absence of the IL18 receptor ( IL18r ) does not affect atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E – deficient ( Apoe−/− ) mice , nor does it affect IL18 cell surface binding to or signaling in endothelial cells . As identified initially by co-immunoprecipitation with IL18 , we found that IL18 interacts with the Na-Cl co-transporter ( NCC ; also known as SLC12A3 ) , a 12-transmembrane-domain ion transporter protein preferentially expressed in the kidney . NCC is expressed in atherosclerotic lesions , where it colocalizes with IL18r . In Apoe−/− mice , combined deficiency of IL18r and NCC , but not single deficiency of either protein , protects mice from atherosclerosis . Peritoneal macrophages from Apoe−/− mice or from Apoe−/− mice lacking IL18r or NCC show IL18 binding and induction of cell signaling and cytokine and chemokine expression , but macrophages from Apoe−/− mice with combined deficiency of IL18r and NCC have a blunted response . An interaction between NCC and IL18r on macrophages was detected by co-immunoprecipitation . IL18 binds to the cell surface of NCC-transfected COS-7 cells , which do not express IL18r , and induces cell signaling and cytokine expression .

23,"N348I mutations cause resistance to nevirapine. [SEP] Background The catalytically active 66-kDa subunit of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) reverse transcriptase ( RT ) consists of DNA polymerase , connection , and ribonuclease H ( RNase H ) domains . Almost all known RT inhibitor resistance mutations identified to date map to the polymerase domain of the enzyme . However , the connection and RNase H domains are not routinely analysed in clinical samples and none of the genotyping assays available for patient management sequence the entire RT coding region . The British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS ( the Centre ) genotypes clinical isolates up to codon 400 in RT , and our retrospective statistical analyses of the Centre ’s database have identified an N348I mutation in the RT connection domain in treatment-experienced individuals . The objective of this multidisciplinary study was to establish the in vivo relevance of this mutation and its role in drug resistance . Methods and Findings The prevalence of N348I in clinical isolates , the time taken for it to emerge under selective drug pressure , and its association with changes in viral load , specific drug treatment , and known drug resistance mutations was analysed from genotypes , viral loads , and treatment histories from the Centre ’s database . N348I increased in prevalence from below 1 % in 368 treatmentnao ¨ve individuals to 12.1 % in 1,009 treatment-experienced patients ( p ¼ 7.7 3 10 � 12 ) . N348I appeared early in therapy and was highly associated with thymidine analogue mutations ( TAMs ) M41L and T215Y/F ( p , 0.001 ) , the lamivudine resistance mutations M184V/I ( p , 0.001 ) , and non-nucleoside RTI ( NNRTI ) resistance mutations K103N and Y181C/I ( p , 0.001 ) . The association with TAMs and NNRTI resistance mutations was consistent with the selection of N348I in patients treated with regimens that included both zidovudine and nevirapine ( odds ratio 2.62 , 95 % confidence interval 1.43–4.81 ) . The appearance of N348I was associated with a significant increase in viral load ( p , 0.001 ) , which was as large as the viral load increases observed for any of the TAMs . However , this analysis did not account for the simultaneous selection of other RT or protease inhibitor resistance mutations on viral load . To delineate the role of this mutation in RT inhibitor resistance , N348I was introduced into HIV-1 molecular clones containing different genetic backbones . N348I decreased zidovudine susceptibility 2- to 4-fold in the context of wildtype HIV-1 or when combined with TAMs . N348I also decreased susceptibility to nevirapine ( 7.4fold ) and efavirenz ( 2.5-fold ) and significantly potentiated resistance to these drugs when combined with K103N . Biochemical analyses of recombinant RT containing N348I provide supporting evidence for the role of this mutation in zidovudine and NNRTI resistance and give some insight into the molecular mechanism of resistance .

DESIGN Updated meta-analysis of randomised trials . DATA SOURCES Medline , Embase , the Cochrane controlled trials register , the Current Science meta-register of controlled trials , and reference lists of identified articles . All data sources were searched from December 2002 ( end date of last search ) to December 2006 . STUDIES REVIEWED Double blind randomised placebo controlled trials of approved anti-obesity drugs used in adults ( age over 18 ) for one year or longer . RESULTS 30 trials of one to four years ' duration met the inclusion criteria : 16 orlistat ( n=10 631 participants ) , 10 sibutramine ( n=2623 ) , and four rimonabant ( n=6365 ) . Of these , 14 trials were new and 16 had previously been identified . Attrition rates averaged 30 - 40 % . Compared with placebo , orlistat reduced weight by 2.9 kg ( 95 % confidence interval 2.5 kg to 3.2 kg ) , sibutramine by 4.2 kg ( 3.6 kg to 4.7 kg ) , and rimonabant by 4.7 kg ( 4.1 kg to 5.3 kg ) . Patients receiving active drug treatment were significantly more likely to achieve 5 % and 10 % weight loss thresholds . Orlistat reduced the incidence of diabetes and improved concentrations of total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol , blood pressure , and glycaemic control in patients with diabetes but increased rates of gastrointestinal side effects and slightly lowered concentrations of high density lipoprotein . Sibutramine improved [ corrected ] concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides [ corrected ] Rimonabant improved concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides , blood pressure , and glycaemic control in patients with diabetes but increased the risk of mood disorders .

26,"The density of cytokine receptor bearing cells affects the distance over which cytokines act. [SEP] & NA ; Immune cells communicate by exchanging cytokines to achieve a context‐appropriate response , but the distances over which such communication happens are not known . Here , we used theoretical considerations and experimental models of immune responses in vitro and in vivo to quantify the spatial extent of cytokine communications in dense tissues . We established that competition between cytokine diffusion and consumption generated spatial niches of high cytokine concentrations with sharp boundaries . The size of these self‐assembled niches scaled with the density of cytokine‐consuming cells , a parameter that gets tuned during immune responses . In vivo , we measured interactions on length scales of 80–120 & mgr;m , which resulted in a high degree of cell‐to‐cell variance in cytokine exposure . Such heterogeneous distributions of cytokines were a source of non‐genetic cell‐to‐cell variability that is often overlooked in single‐cell studies .

In this study we investigated whether Notch signaling is involved in the tight interactions between neoplastic plasma cells and their bone marrow microenvironment , which are essential for tumor cell growth in multiple myeloma ( MM ) . Here we demonstrate that Notch receptors and their ligand Jagged1 are highly expressed in cultured and primary MM cells , whereas nonneoplastic counterparts show low to undetectable levels of Notch .

While significant progress has been made in understanding the induction of tumor vasculature by secreted angiogenic factors , little is known regarding contact-dependent signals that promote tumor angiogenesis . Here , we report that the Notch ligand Jagged1 induced by growth factors via mitogen-activating protein kinase ( MAPK ) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) cells triggered Notch activation in neighboring endothelial cells ( ECs ) and promoted capillary-like sprout formation . Jagged1-expressing HNSCC cells significantly enhanced neovascularization and tumor growth in vivo .

These unidentified SMC-derived cells exhibit phenotypes of other cell lineages , including macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) . SMC-specific conditional knockout of Krüppel-like factor 4 ( Klf4 ) resulted in reduced numbers of SMC-derived MSC- and macrophage-like cells , a marked reduction in lesion size , and increases in multiple indices of plaque stability , including an increase in fibrous cap thickness as compared to wild-type controls .

For men , taking the Polymeal daily represented an increase in total life expectancy of 6.6 years , an increase in life expectancy free from cardiovascular disease of 9.0 years , and a decrease in life expectancy with cardiovascular disease of 2.4 years . The corresponding differences for women were 4.8 , 8.1 , and 3.3 years . CONCLUSION The Polymeal promises to be an effective , non-pharmacological , safe , cheap , and tasty alternative to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and increase life expectancy in the general population .

31,"Aggravated inflammation is dependent on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. [SEP] Development of the acute and chronic inflammatory responses known as gout and pseudogout are associated with the deposition of monosodium urate ( MSU ) or calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate ( CPPD ) crystals , respectively , in joints and periarticular tissues . Although MSU crystals were first identified as the aetiological agent of gout in the eighteenth century and more recently as a ‘ danger signal ’ released from dying cells , little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying MSU- or CPPD-induced inflammation . Here we show that MSU and CPPD engage the caspase-1-activating NALP3 ( also called cryopyrin ) inflammasome , resulting in the production of active interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 . Macrophages from mice deficient in various components of the inflammasome such as caspase-1 , ASC and NALP3 are defective in crystal-induced IL-1β activation . Moreover , an impaired neutrophil influx is found in an in vivo model of crystal-induced peritonitis in inflammasome-deficient mice or mice deficient in the IL-1β receptor ( IL-1R ) .

It remains unknown whether the impressive effects of CD19 CARs relate to greater susceptibility of hematologic malignancies to CAR therapies , or superior functionality of the CD19 CAR itself . We show that tonic CAR CD3-ζ phosphorylation , triggered by antigen-independent clustering of CAR single-chain variable fragments , can induce early exhaustion of CAR T cells that limits antitumor efficacy . Such activation is present to varying degrees in all CARs studied , except the highly effective CD19 CAR . We further determine that CD28 costimulation augments , whereas 4 - 1BB costimulation reduces , exhaustion induced by persistent CAR signaling .

33,"A high microerythrocyte count protects against severe anemia in homozygous alpha (+)- thalassemia trait subjects. [SEP] BACKGROUND The heritable haemoglobinopathy alpha(+)-thalassaemia is caused by the reduced synthesis of alpha-globin chains that form part of normal adult haemoglobin ( Hb ) . Individuals homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia have microcytosis and an increased erythrocyte count . Alpha(+)-thalassaemia homozygosity confers considerable protection against severe malaria , including severe malarial anaemia ( SMA ) ( Hb concentration < 50 g/l ) , but does not influence parasite count . We tested the hypothesis that the erythrocyte indices associated with alpha(+)-thalassaemia homozygosity provide a haematological benefit during acute malaria . METHODS AND FINDINGS Data from children living on the north coast of Papua New Guinea who had participated in a case-control study of the protection afforded by alpha(+)-thalassaemia against severe malaria were reanalysed to assess the genotype-specific reduction in erythrocyte count and Hb levels associated with acute malarial disease . We observed a reduction in median erythrocyte count of approximately 1.5 x 10(12)/l in all children with acute falciparum malaria relative to values in community children ( p < 0.001 ) . We developed a simple mathematical model of the linear relationship between Hb concentration and erythrocyte count . This model predicted that children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia lose less Hb than children of normal genotype for a reduction in erythrocyte count of > 1.1 x 10(12)/l as a result of the reduced mean cell Hb in homozygous alpha(+)-thalassaemia . In addition , children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia require a 10 % greater reduction in erythrocyte count than children of normal genotype ( p = 0.02 ) for Hb concentration to fall to 50 g/l , the cutoff for SMA . We estimated that the haematological profile in children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia reduces the risk of SMA during acute malaria compared to children of normal genotype ( relative risk 0.52 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.24 - 1.12 , p = 0.09 ) . CONCLUSIONS The increased erythrocyte count and microcytosis in children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia may contribute substantially to their protection against SMA . A lower concentration of Hb per erythrocyte and a larger population of erythrocytes may be a biologically advantageous strategy against the significant reduction in erythrocyte count that occurs during acute infection with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum . This haematological profile may reduce the risk of anaemia by other Plasmodium species , as well as other causes of anaemia . Other host polymorphisms that induce an increased erythrocyte count and microcytosis may confer a similar advantage .

Here we have examined three lateral gynandromorph chickens ( a rare , naturally occurring phenomenon in which one side of the animal appears male and the other female ) to investigate the sex-determining mechanism in birds . These studies demonstrated that gynandromorph birds are genuine male : female chimaeras , and indicated that male and female avian somatic cells may have an inherent sex identity . To test this hypothesis , we transplanted presumptive mesoderm between embryos of reciprocal sexes to generate embryos containing male : female chimaeric gonads . In contrast to the outcome for mammalian mixed-sex chimaeras , in chicken mixed-sex chimaeras the donor cells were excluded from the functional structures of the host gonad . In an example where female tissue was transplanted into a male host , donor cells contributing to the developing testis retained a female identity and expressed a marker of female function .

Previous research has suggested beneficial outcomes of both psychological and pharmacological treatments , but blinded placebo-controlled trials comparing the effects of these treatments are lacking . OBJECTIVE To examine short- and long-term clinical efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) and pharmacological treatment in older adults experiencing chronic primary insomnia . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial of 46 adults ( mean age , 60.8 y ; 22 women ) with chronic primary insomnia conducted between January 2004 and December 2005 in a single Norwegian university-based outpatient clinic for adults and elderly patients . INTERVENTION CBT ( sleep hygiene , sleep restriction , stimulus control , cognitive therapy , and relaxation ; n = 18 ) , sleep medication ( 7.5-mg zopiclone each night ; n = 16 ) , or placebo medication ( n = 12 ) . All treatment duration was 6 weeks , and the 2 active treatments were followed up at 6 months . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Ambulant clinical polysomnographic data and sleep diaries were used to determine total wake time , total sleep time , sleep efficiency , and slow-wave sleep ( only assessed using polysomnography ) on all 3 assessment points . RESULTS CBT resulted in improved short- and long-term outcomes compared with zopiclone on 3 out of 4 outcome measures . For most outcomes , zopiclone did not differ from placebo . Participants receiving CBT improved their sleep efficiency from 81.4 % at pretreatment to 90.1 % at 6-month follow-up compared with a decrease from 82.3 % to 81.9 % in the zopiclone group . Participants in the CBT group spent much more time in slow-wave sleep ( stages 3 and 4 ) compared with those in other groups , and spent less time awake during the night . Total sleep time was similar in all 3 groups ; at 6 months , patients receiving CBT had better sleep efficiency using polysomnography than those taking zopiclone . CONCLUSION These results suggest that interventions based on CBT are superior to zopiclone treatment both in short- and long-term management of insomnia in older adults .

The pathways that orchestrate uptake of fatty acids remain incompletely understood . Expression of the integrin ligand Mfge8 is increased in human obesity and in mice on a high-fat diet , but its role in obesity is unknown . We show here that Mfge8 promotes the absorption of dietary triglycerides and the cellular uptake of fatty acid and that Mfge8-deficient ( Mfge8−/− ) mice are protected from diet-induced obesity , steatohepatitis and insulin resistance . Mechanistically , we found that Mfge8 coordinates fatty acid uptake through αvβ3 integrin– and αvβ5 integrin – dependent phosphorylation of Akt by phosphatidylinositide-3 kinase and mTOR complex 2 , leading to translocation of Cd36 and Fatp1 from cytoplasmic vesicles to the cell surface . Collectively , our results imply a role for Mfge8 in regulating the absorption and storage of dietary fats , as well as in the development of obesity and its complications .

38,"Diabetes remission occurs more in people treated with conventional therapy than in people treated with laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding surgery. [SEP] CONTEXT Observational studies suggest that surgically induced loss of weight may be effective therapy for type 2 diabetes . OBJECTIVE To determine if surgically induced weight loss results in better glycemic control and less need for diabetes medications than conventional approaches to weight loss and diabetes control . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Unblinded randomized controlled trial conducted from December 2002 through December 2006 at the University Obesity Research Center in Australia , with general community recruitment to established treatment programs . Participants were 60 obese patients ( BMI > 30 and < 40 ) with recently diagnosed ( < 2 years ) type 2 diabetes . INTERVENTIONS Conventional diabetes therapy with a focus on weight loss by lifestyle change vs laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding with conventional diabetes care . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Remission of type 2 diabetes ( fasting glucose level < 126 mg/dL [ 7.0 mmol/L ] and glycated hemoglobin [ HbA1c ] value < 6.2 % while taking no glycemic therapy ) . Secondary measures included weight and components of the metabolic syndrome . Analysis was by intention-to-treat . RESULTS Of the 60 patients enrolled , 55 ( 92 % ) completed the 2-year follow-up . Remission of type 2 diabetes was achieved by 22 ( 73 % ) in the surgical group and 4 ( 13 % ) in the conventional-therapy group . Relative risk of remission for the surgical group was 5.5 ( 95 % confidence interval , 2.2 - 14.0 ) . Surgical and conventional-therapy groups lost a mean ( SD ) of 20.7 % ( 8.6 % ) and 1.7 % ( 5.2 % ) of weight , respectively , at 2 years ( P < .001 ) . Remission of type 2 diabetes was related to weight loss ( R2 = 0.46 , P < .001 ) and lower baseline HbA1c levels ( combined R2 = 0.52 , P < .001 ) . There were no serious complications in either group . CONCLUSIONS Participants randomized to surgical therapy were more likely to achieve remission of type 2 diabetes through greater weight loss .

[SEP] CONTEXT Pharmacist review of medication orders in the intensive care unit ( ICU ) has been shown to prevent errors , and pharmacist consultation has reduced drug costs . However , whether pharmacist participation in the ICU at the time of drug prescribing reduces adverse events has not been studied . OBJECTIVE To measure the effect of pharmacist participation on medical rounds in the ICU on the rate of preventable adverse drug events ( ADEs ) caused by ordering errors . DESIGN Before-after comparison between phase 1 ( baseline ) and phase 2 ( after intervention implemented ) and phase 2 comparison with a control unit that did not receive the intervention . SETTING A medical ICU ( study unit ) and a coronary care unit ( control unit ) in a large urban teaching hospital . PATIENTS Seventy-five patients randomly selected from each of 3 groups : all admissions to the study unit from February 1 , 1993 , through July 31 , 1993 ( baseline ) and all admissions to the study unit ( postintervention ) and control unit from October 1 , 1994 , through July 7 , 1995 . In addition , 50 patients were selected at random from the control unit during the baseline period . INTERVENTION A senior pharmacist made rounds with the ICU team and remained in the ICU for consultation in the morning , and was available on call throughout the day . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Preventable ADEs due to ordering ( prescribing ) errors and the number , type , and acceptance of interventions made by the pharmacist . Preventable ADEs were identified by review of medical records of the randomly selected patients during both preintervention and postintervention phases . Pharmacists recorded all recommendations , which were then analyzed by type and acceptance . RESULTS The rate of preventable ordering ADEs decreased by 66 % from 10.4 per 1000 patient-days ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 7 - 14 ) before the intervention to 3.5 ( 95 % CI , 1 - 5 ; P<.001 ) after the intervention . In the control unit , the rate was essentially unchanged during the same time periods : 10.9 ( 95 % CI , 6 - 16 ) and 12.4 ( 95 % CI , 8 - 17 ) per 1000 patient-days . The pharmacist made 366 recommendations related to drug ordering , of which 362 ( 99 % ) were accepted by physicians . CONCLUSIONS The presence of a pharmacist on rounds as a full member of the patient care team in a medical ICU was associated with a substantially lower rate of ADEs caused by prescribing errors .

PARTICIPANTS 999,378 liveborn singletons and linked individual level information on macrolide prescriptions ( maternal use during pregnancy , n=30,091 ; maternal use after birth , n=21,557 ; use in infants , n=6591 ) , surgery for IHPS , and potential confounders . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Surgery for IHPS by three categories of macrolide use : in mothers during pregnancy , in mothers after birth , and in infants after birth . RESULTS 880 infants developed IHPS ( 0.9 cases per 1000 births ) . Compared with infants with no use of macrolides , the adjusted rate ratio for IHPS in infants with use of macrolides during days 0 to 13 after birth was 29.8 ( 95 % confidence interval 16.4 to 54.1 ) and during days 14 to 120 was 3.24 ( 1.20 to 8.74 ) ; the corresponding absolute risk differences were 24.4 ( 95 % confidence interval 13.0 to 44.1 ) and 0.65 ( 0.06 to 2.21 ) cases per 1000 infants exposed to macrolides , respectively . The rate ratio for maternal use of macrolides for days 0 to 13 after birth was 3.49 ( 1.92 to 6.34 ) and for days 14 to 120 was 0.70 ( 0.26 to 1.90 ) ; the corresponding absolute risk differences were 2.15 ( 0.82 to 4.64 ) and -0.11 ( -0.26 to 0.31 ) . The rate ratios for maternal use of macrolides during pregnancy were 1.02 ( 0.65 to 1.59 ) for weeks 0 to 27 and 1.77 ( 0.95 to 3.31 ) for weeks 28 to birth ; the corresponding absolute risk differences were 0.01 ( -0.31 to 0.50 ) and 0.67 ( -0.06 to 2.02 ) . CONCLUSIONS Treatment of young infants with macrolide antibiotics was strongly associated with IHPS and should therefore only be administered if potential treatment benefits outweigh the risk . Maternal use of macrolides during the first two weeks after birth was also associated with an increased risk of IHPS . A possible association was also found with use during late pregnancy .

41,"miR-142-5P is a known regulator of raised body temperature. [SEP] Fever is commonly used to diagnose disease and is consistently associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients . However , the molecular controls of elevated body temperature are poorly understood . We discovered that the expression of RNA-binding motif protein 3 ( RBM3 ) , known to respond to cold stress and to modulate microRNA ( miRNA ) expression , was reduced in 30 patients with fever , and in THP-1-derived macrophages maintained at a fever-like temperature ( 40 ° C ) . Notably , RBM3 expression is reduced during fever whether or not infection is demonstrable . Reduced RBM3 expression resulted in increased expression of RBM3-targeted temperature-sensitive miRNAs , we termed thermomiRs . ThermomiRs such as miR-142 - 5p and miR-143 in turn target endogenous pyrogens including IL-6 , IL6ST , TLR2 , PGE2 and TNF to complete a negative feedback mechanism , which may be crucial to prevent pathological hyperthermia . Using normal PBMCs that were exogenously exposed to fever-like temperature ( 40 ° C ) , we further demonstrate the trend by which decreased levels of RBM3 were associated with increased levels of miR-142 - 5p and miR-143 and vice versa over a 24 h time course . Collectively , our results indicate the existence of a negative feedback loop that regulates fever via reduced RBM3 levels and increased expression of miR-142 - 5p and miR-143 .

42,"N348I mutations reduce resistance to nevirapine. [SEP] Background The catalytically active 66-kDa subunit of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) reverse transcriptase ( RT ) consists of DNA polymerase , connection , and ribonuclease H ( RNase H ) domains . Almost all known RT inhibitor resistance mutations identified to date map to the polymerase domain of the enzyme . However , the connection and RNase H domains are not routinely analysed in clinical samples and none of the genotyping assays available for patient management sequence the entire RT coding region . The British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS ( the Centre ) genotypes clinical isolates up to codon 400 in RT , and our retrospective statistical analyses of the Centre ’s database have identified an N348I mutation in the RT connection domain in treatment-experienced individuals . The objective of this multidisciplinary study was to establish the in vivo relevance of this mutation and its role in drug resistance . Methods and Findings The prevalence of N348I in clinical isolates , the time taken for it to emerge under selective drug pressure , and its association with changes in viral load , specific drug treatment , and known drug resistance mutations was analysed from genotypes , viral loads , and treatment histories from the Centre ’s database . N348I increased in prevalence from below 1 % in 368 treatmentnao ¨ve individuals to 12.1 % in 1,009 treatment-experienced patients ( p ¼ 7.7 3 10 � 12 ) . N348I appeared early in therapy and was highly associated with thymidine analogue mutations ( TAMs ) M41L and T215Y/F ( p , 0.001 ) , the lamivudine resistance mutations M184V/I ( p , 0.001 ) , and non-nucleoside RTI ( NNRTI ) resistance mutations K103N and Y181C/I ( p , 0.001 ) . The association with TAMs and NNRTI resistance mutations was consistent with the selection of N348I in patients treated with regimens that included both zidovudine and nevirapine ( odds ratio 2.62 , 95 % confidence interval 1.43–4.81 ) . The appearance of N348I was associated with a significant increase in viral load ( p , 0.001 ) , which was as large as the viral load increases observed for any of the TAMs . However , this analysis did not account for the simultaneous selection of other RT or protease inhibitor resistance mutations on viral load . To delineate the role of this mutation in RT inhibitor resistance , N348I was introduced into HIV-1 molecular clones containing different genetic backbones . N348I decreased zidovudine susceptibility 2- to 4-fold in the context of wildtype HIV-1 or when combined with TAMs . N348I also decreased susceptibility to nevirapine ( 7.4fold ) and efavirenz ( 2.5-fold ) and significantly potentiated resistance to these drugs when combined with K103N . Biochemical analyses of recombinant RT containing N348I provide supporting evidence for the role of this mutation in zidovudine and NNRTI resistance and give some insight into the molecular mechanism of resistance .

43,"Allogeneic mechanical circulatory support is not as effective as autologous mechanical circulatory support for treating acute myocardial infarction. [SEP] CONTEXT Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) are under evaluation as a therapy for ischemic cardiomyopathy ( ICM ) . Both autologous and allogeneic MSC therapies are possible ; however , their safety and efficacy have not been compared . OBJECTIVE To test whether allogeneic MSCs are as safe and effective as autologous MSCs in patients with left ventricular ( LV ) dysfunction due to ICM . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PATIENTS A phase 1/2 randomized comparison ( POSEIDON study ) in a US tertiary-care referral hospital of allogeneic and autologous MSCs in 30 patients with LV dysfunction due to ICM between April 2 , 2010 , and September 14 , 2011 , with 13-month follow-up . INTERVENTION Twenty million , 100 million , or 200 million cells ( 5 patients in each cell type per dose level ) were delivered by transendocardial stem cell injection into 10 LV sites . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Thirty-day postcatheterization incidence of predefined treatment-emergent serious adverse events ( SAEs ) . Efficacy assessments included 6-minute walk test , exercise peak VO2 , Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire ( MLHFQ ) , New York Heart Association class , LV volumes , ejection fraction ( EF ) , early enhancement defect ( EED ; infarct size ) , and sphericity index . RESULTS Within 30 days , 1 patient in each group ( treatment-emergent SAE rate , 6.7 % ) was hospitalized for heart failure , less than the prespecified stopping event rate of 25 % . The 1-year incidence of SAEs was 33.3 % ( n = 5 ) in the allogeneic group and 53.3 % ( n = 8) in the autologous group ( P = .46 ) . At 1 year , there were no ventricular arrhythmia SAEs observed among allogeneic recipients compared with 4 patients ( 26.7 % ) in the autologous group ( P = .10 ) . Relative to baseline , autologous but not allogeneic MSC therapy was associated with an improvement in the 6-minute walk test and the MLHFQ score , but neither improved exercise VO2 max . Allogeneic and autologous MSCs reduced mean EED by −33.21 % ( 95 % CI , −43.61 % to −22.81 % ; P < .001 ) and sphericity index but did not increase EF . Allogeneic MSCs reduced LV end-diastolic volumes . Low-dose concentration MSCs ( 20 million cells ) produced greatest reductions in LV volumes and increased EF . Allogeneic MSCs did not stimulate significant donor-specific alloimmune reactions . CONCLUSIONS In this early-stage study of patients with ICM , transendocardial injection of allogeneic and autologous MSCs without a placebo control were both associated with low rates of treatment-emergent SAEs , including immunologic reactions . In aggregate , MSC injection favorably affected patient functional capacity , quality of life , and ventricular remodeling . TRIAL REGISTRATION clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT01087996 .

DESIGN , SETTING , AND PATIENTS Randomized placebo-controlled trial conducted among 215 children undergoing elective tonsillectomy at a major public teaching hospital in Switzerland from February 2005 to December 2007 . INTERVENTIONS Children were randomly assigned to receive dexamethasone ( 0.05 , 0.15 , or 0.5 mg/kg ) or placebo intravenously after induction of anesthesia . Acetaminophen-codeine and ibuprofen were given as postoperative analgesia . Follow-up continued until the 10th postoperative day . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary end point was prevention of PONV at 24 hours ; secondary end points were decrease in the need for ibuprofen at 24 hours and evaluation of adverse effects . RESULTS At 24 hours , 24 of 54 participants who received placebo ( 44 % ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 31%-59 % ) had experienced PONV compared with 20 of 53 ( 38 % ; 95 % CI , 25%-52 % ) , 13 of 54 ( 24 % ; 95 % CI , 13%-38 % ) , and 6 of 52 ( 12 % ; 95 % CI , 4%-23 % ) who received dexamethasone at 0.05 , 0.15 , and 0.5 mg/kg , respectively ( P<.001 for linear trend ) . Children who received dexamethasone received significantly less ibuprofen . There were 26 postoperative bleeding episodes in 22 children . Two of 53 ( 4 % ; 95 % CI , 0.5%-13 % ) children who received placebo had bleeding compared with 6 of 53 ( 11 % ; 95 % CI , 4%-23 % ) , 2 of 51 ( 4 % ; 95 % CI , 0.5%-13 % ) , and 12 of 50 ( 24 % ; 95 % CI , 13%-38 % ) who received dexamethasone at 0.05 , 0.15 , and 0.5 mg/kg , respectively ( P = .003 ) . Dexamethasone , 0.5 mg/kg , was associated with the highest bleeding risk ( adjusted relative risk , 6.80 ; 95 % CI , 1.77 - 16.5 ) . Eight children had to undergo emergency reoperation because of bleeding , all of whom had received dexamethasone . The trial was stopped early for safety reasons .

48,"HbA1c consistently overestimates glycemic control in black individuals with Sickle cell trait (SCT). [SEP] Importance Hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) reflects past glucose concentrations , but this relationship may differ between those with sickle cell trait ( SCT ) and those without it . Objective To evaluate the association between SCT and HbA1c for given levels of fasting or 2-hour glucose levels among African Americans . Design , Setting , and Participants Retrospective cohort study using data collected from 7938 participants in 2 community-based cohorts , the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults ( CARDIA ) study and the Jackson Heart Study ( JHS ) . From the CARDIA study , 2637 patients contributed a maximum of 2 visits ( 2005 - 2011 ) ; from the JHS , 5301 participants contributed a maximum of 3 visits ( 2000 - 2013 ) . All visits were scheduled at approximately 5-year intervals . Participants without SCT data , those without any concurrent HbA1c and glucose measurements , and those with hemoglobin variants HbSS , HbCC , or HbAC were excluded . Analysis of the primary outcome was conducted using generalized estimating equations ( GEE ) to examine the association of SCT with HbA1c levels , controlling for fasting or 2-hour glucose measures . Exposures Presence of SCT . Main Outcomes and Measures Hemoglobin A1c stratified by the presence or absence of SCT was the primary outcome measure . Results The analytic sample included 4620 participants ( mean age , 52.3 [ SD , 11.8 ] years ; 2835 women [ 61.3 % ] ; 367 [ 7.9 % ] with SCT ) with 9062 concurrent measures of fasting glucose and HbA1c levels . In unadjusted GEE analyses , for a given fasting glucose , HbA1c values were statistically significantly lower in those with ( 5.72 % ) vs those without ( 6.01 % ) SCT ( mean HbA1c difference , −0.29 % ; 95 % CI , −0.35 % to −0.23 % ) . Findings were similar in models adjusted for key risk factors and in analyses using 2001 concurrent measures of 2-hour glucose and HbA1c concentration for those with SCT ( mean , 5.35 % ) vs those without SCT ( mean , 5.65 % ) for a mean HbA1c difference of −0.30 % ( 95 % CI , −0.39 % to −0.21 % ) . The HbA1c difference by SCT was greater at higher fasting ( P = .02 for interaction ) and 2-hour ( P = .03 ) glucose concentrations . The prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes was statistically significantly lower among participants with SCT when defined using HbA1c values ( 29.2 % vs 48.6 % for prediabetes and 3.8 % vs 7.3 % for diabetes in 572 observations from participants with SCT and 6877 observations from participants without SCT ; P<.001 for both comparisons ) . Conclusions and Relevance Among African Americans from 2 large , well-established cohorts , participants with SCT had lower levels of HbA1c at any given concentration of fasting or 2-hour glucose compared with participants without SCT . These findings suggest that HbA1c may systematically underestimate past glycemia in black patients with SCT and may require further evaluation .

50,"The latent infection of myeloid cells with human cytomegalovirus induces a number of changes in gene expression. [SEP] Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) is one of the largest known DNA viruses . It is ubiquitous , and following resolution of primary productive infection , it persists in the human host by establishing a lifelong latent infection in myeloid lineage cells such as monocytes and their progenitors . Most adults with HCMV infection are healthy but it can cause neurologic deficits in infants , and remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunosuppressed patient . Microarray-based studies of HCMV have provided useful information about genes that are transcriptionally active during both productive and latent phases of infection . This chapter describes how to study genes in HCMV using microarrays and two cell types ( productively infected human foreskin fibroblasts , and latently infected primary human myeloid progenitor cells ) . Monocytes are primary targets for human CMV ( HCMV ) infection and are proposed to be responsible for hematogenous dissemination of the virus . Monocytes acquire different functional traits during polarization to the classical proinflammatory M1 macrophage or the alternative antiinflammatory M2 macrophage . We hypothesized that HCMV induced a proinflammatory M1 macrophage following infection to promote viral dissemination because , biologically , a proinflammatory state provides the tools to drive infected monocytes from the blood into the tissue . To test this hypothesis of monocyte conversion from a normal quiescent phenotype to an inflammatory phenotype , we used Affymetrix Microarray to acquire a transcriptional profile of infected monocytes at a time point our data emphasized is a key temporal regulatory point following infection . We found that HCMV significantly up-regulated 583 ( 5.2 % ) of the total genes and down-regulated 621 ( 5.5 % ) of the total genes > or=1.5-fold at 4 h postinfection . Further ontology analysis revealed that genes implicated in classical M1 macrophage activation were stimulated by HCMV infection . We found that 65 % of genes strictly associated with M1 polarization were up-regulated , while only 4 % of genes solely associated with M2 polarization were up-regulated . Analysis of the monocyte chemokinome at the transcriptional level showed that 44 % of M1 and 33 % of M2 macrophage chemokines were up-regulated . Proteomic analysis using chemokine Ab arrays confirmed the secretion of these chemotactic proteins from HCMV-infected monocytes . Overall , the results identify that the HCMV-infected monocyte transcriptome displayed a unique M1/M2 polarization signature that was skewed toward the classical M1 activation phenotype .

DATA SOURCES Medline , Embase , the Cochrane Trials Registry , and PsycLIT . Studies reviewed Randomised trials of adults receiving tricyclics as only treatment for a minimum of four weeks . DATA EXTRACTION Frequency of headaches ( number of headache attacks for migraine and number of days with headache for tension-type headaches ) , intensity of headache , and headache index . RESULTS 37 studies met the inclusion criteria . Tricyclics significantly reduced the number of days with tension-type headache and number of headache attacks from migraine than placebo ( average standardised mean difference -1.29 , 95 % confidence interval -2.18 to -0.39 and -0.70 , -0.93 to -0.48 ) but not compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( -0.80 , -2.63 to 0.02 and -0.20 , -0.60 to 0.19 ) . The effect of tricyclics increased with longer duration of treatment ( β=-0.11 , 95 % confidence interval -0.63 to -0.15 ; P<0.0005 ) . Tricyclics were also more likely to reduce the intensity of headaches by at least 50 % than either placebo ( tension-type : relative risk 1.41 , 95 % confidence interval 1.02 to 1.89 ; migraine : 1.80 , 1.24 to 2.62 ) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( 1.73 , 1.34 to 2.22 and 1.72 , 1.15 to 2.55 ) . Tricyclics were more likely to cause adverse effects than placebo ( 1.53 , 95 % confidence interval 1.11 to 2.12 ) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( 2.22 , 1.52 to 3.32 ) , including dry mouth ( P<0.0005 for both ) , drowsiness ( P<0.0005 for both ) , and weight gain ( P<0.001 for both ) , but did not increase dropout rates ( placebo : 1.22 , 0.83 to 1.80 , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors : 1.16 , 0.81 to 2.97 ) .

52,"Sepsis related mortality has remained stable between 2009-2014. [SEP] Importance Estimates from claims-based analyses suggest that the incidence of sepsis is increasing and mortality rates from sepsis are decreasing . However , estimates from claims data may lack clinical fidelity and can be affected by changing diagnosis and coding practices over time . Objective To estimate the US national incidence of sepsis and trends using detailed clinical data from the electronic health record ( EHR ) systems of diverse hospitals . Design , Setting , and Population Retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted to 409 academic , community , and federal hospitals from 2009 - 2014 . Exposures Sepsis was identified using clinical indicators of presumed infection and concurrent acute organ dysfunction , adapting Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock ( Sepsis-3 ) criteria for objective and consistent EHR-based surveillance . Main Outcomes and Measures Sepsis incidence , outcomes , and trends from 2009 - 2014 were calculated using regression models and compared with claims-based estimates using International Classification of Diseases , Ninth Revision , Clinical Modification codes for severe sepsis or septic shock . Case-finding criteria were validated against Sepsis-3 criteria using medical record reviews . Results A total of 173 690 sepsis cases ( mean age , 66.5 [ SD , 15.5 ] y ; 77 660 [ 42.4 % ] women ) were identified using clinical criteria among 2 901 019 adults admitted to study hospitals in 2014 ( 6.0 % incidence ) . Of these , 26 061 ( 15.0 % ) died in the hospital and 10 731 ( 6.2 % ) were discharged to hospice . From 2009 - 2014 , sepsis incidence using clinical criteria was stable ( + 0.6 % relative change/y [ 95 % CI , −2.3 % to 3.5 % ] , P = .67 ) whereas incidence per claims increased ( + 10.3%/y [ 95 % CI , 7.2 % to 13.3 % ] , P < .001 ) . In-hospital mortality using clinical criteria declined ( −3.3%/y [ 95 % CI , −5.6 % to −1.0 % ] , P = .004 ) , but there was no significant change in the combined outcome of death or discharge to hospice ( −1.3%/y [ 95 % CI , −3.2 % to 0.6 % ] , P = .19 ) . In contrast , mortality using claims declined significantly ( −7.0%/y [ 95 % CI , −8.8 % to −5.2 % ] , P < .001 ) , as did death or discharge to hospice ( −4.5%/y [ 95 % CI , −6.1 % to −2.8 % ] , P < .001 ) . Clinical criteria were more sensitive in identifying sepsis than claims ( 69.7 % [ 95 % CI , 52.9 % to 92.0 % ] vs 32.3 % [ 95 % CI , 24.4 % to 43.0 % ] , P < .001 ) , with comparable positive predictive value ( 70.4 % [ 95 % CI , 64.0 % to 76.8 % ] vs 75.2 % [ 95 % CI , 69.8 % to 80.6 % ] , P = .23 ) . Conclusions and Relevance In clinical data from 409 hospitals , sepsis was present in 6 % of adult hospitalizations , and in contrast to claims-based analyses , neither the incidence of sepsis nor the combined outcome of death or discharge to hospice changed significantly between 2009 - 2014 . The findings also suggest that EHR-based clinical data provide more objective estimates than claims-based data for sepsis surveillance .

53,"Therapeutics receiving accelerated approval encounter a lower frequency of post-marketing safety events [SEP] Importance Postmarket safety events of novel pharmaceuticals and biologics occur when new safety risks are identified after initial regulatory approval of these therapeutics . These safety events can change how novel therapeutics are used in clinical practice and inform patient and clinician decision making . Objectives To characterize the frequency of postmarket safety events among novel therapeutics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , and to examine whether any novel therapeutic characteristics known at the time of FDA approval were associated with increased risk . Design and Setting Cohort study of all novel therapeutics approved by the FDA between January 1 , 2001 , and December 31 , 2010 , followed up through February 28 , 2017 . Exposures Novel therapeutic characteristics known at the time of FDA approval , including drug class , therapeutic area , priority review , accelerated approval , orphan status , near – regulatory deadline approval , and regulatory review time . Main Outcomes and Measures A composite of ( 1 ) withdrawals due to safety concerns , ( 2 ) FDA issuance of incremental boxed warnings added in the postmarket period , and ( 3 ) FDA issuance of safety communications . Results From 2001 through 2010 , the FDA approved 222 novel therapeutics ( 183 pharmaceuticals and 39 biologics ) . There were 123 new postmarket safety events ( 3 withdrawals , 61 boxed warnings , and 59 safety communications ) during a median follow-up period of 11.7 years ( interquartile range [ IQR ] , 8.7 - 13.8 years ) , affecting 71 ( 32.0 % ) of the novel therapeutics . The median time from approval to first postmarket safety event was 4.2 years ( IQR , 2.5 - 6.0 years ) , and the proportion of novel therapeutics affected by a postmarket safety event at 10 years was 30.8 % ( 95 % CI , 25.1%-37.5 % ) . In multivariable analysis , postmarket safety events were statistically significantly more frequent among biologics ( incidence rate ratio [ IRR ] = 1.93 ; 95 % CI , 1.06 - 3.52 ; P = .03 ) , therapeutics indicated for the treatment of psychiatric disease ( IRR = 3.78 ; 95 % CI , 1.77 - 8.06 ; P < .001 ) , those receiving accelerated approval ( IRR = 2.20 ; 95 % CI , 1.15 - 4.21 ; P = .02 ) , and those with near – regulatory deadline approval ( IRR = 1.90 ; 95 % CI , 1.19 - 3.05 ; P = .008 ) ; events were statistically significantly less frequent among those with regulatory review times less than 200 days ( IRR = 0.46 ; 95 % CI , 0.24 - 0.87 ; P = .02 ) . Conclusions and Relevance Among 222 novel therapeutics approved by the FDA from 2001 through 2010 , 32 % were affected by a postmarket safety event .

54,"Rapamycin delays aging in fruit flies. [SEP] The target of rapamycin ( TOR ) pathway is a major nutrient-sensing pathway that , when genetically downregulated , increases life span in evolutionarily diverse organisms including mammals . The central component of this pathway , TOR kinase , is the target of the inhibitory drug rapamycin , a highly specific and well-described drug approved for human use . We show here that feeding rapamycin to adult Drosophila produces the life span extension seen in some TOR mutants . Increase in life span by rapamycin was associated with increased resistance to both starvation and paraquat . Analysis of the underlying mechanisms revealed that rapamycin increased longevity specifically through the TORC1 branch of the TOR pathway , through alterations to both autophagy and translation . Rapamycin could increase life span of weak insulin/Igf signaling ( IIS ) pathway mutants and of flies with life span maximized by dietary restriction , indicating additional mechanisms .

55,"Women with a lower birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life. [SEP] BACKGROUND Birth size , perhaps a proxy for prenatal environment , might be a correlate of subsequent breast cancer risk , but findings from epidemiological studies have been inconsistent . We re-analysed individual participant data from published and unpublished studies to obtain more precise estimates of the magnitude and shape of the birth size-breast cancer association . METHODS AND FINDINGS Studies were identified through computer-assisted and manual searches , and personal communication with investigators . Individual participant data from 32 studies , comprising 22,058 breast cancer cases , were obtained . Random effect models were used , if appropriate , to combine study-specific estimates of effect . Birth weight was positively associated with breast cancer risk in studies based on birth records ( pooled relative risk [ RR ] per one standard deviation [ SD ] [ = 0.5 kg ] increment in birth weight : 1.06 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.02 - 1.09 ) and parental recall when the participants were children ( 1.02 ; 95 % CI 0.99 - 1.05 ) , but not in those based on adult self-reports , or maternal recall during the woman 's adulthood ( 0.98 ; 95 % CI 0.95 - 1.01 ) ( p for heterogeneity between data sources = 0.003 ) . Relative to women who weighed 3.000 - 3.499 kg , the risk was 0.96 ( CI 0.80 - 1.16 ) in those who weighed < 2.500 kg , and 1.12 ( 95 % CI 1.00 - 1.25 ) in those who weighed > or = 4.000 kg ( p for linear trend = 0.001 ) in birth record data . Birth length and head circumference from birth records were also positively associated with breast cancer risk ( pooled RR per one SD increment : 1.06 [ 95 % CI 1.03 - 1.10 ] and 1.09 [ 95 % CI 1.03 - 1.15 ] , respectively ) . Simultaneous adjustment for these three birth size variables showed that length was the strongest independent predictor of risk . The birth size effects did not appear to be confounded or mediated by established breast cancer risk factors and were not modified by age or menopausal status . The cumulative incidence of breast cancer per 100 women by age 80 y in the study populations was estimated to be 10.0 , 10.0 , 10.4 , and 11.5 in those who were , respectively , in the bottom , second , third , and top fourths of the birth length distribution . CONCLUSIONS This pooled analysis of individual participant data is consistent with birth size , and in particular birth length , being an independent correlate of breast cancer risk in adulthood . INTRODUCTION Various perinatal factors , including birth weight , birth order , maternal age , gestational age , twin status , and parental smoking , have been postulated to affect breast cancer risk in daughters by altering the hormonal environment of the developing fetal mammary glands . Despite ample biologic plausibility , epidemiologic studies to date have yielded conflicting results . We investigated the associations between perinatal factors and subsequent breast cancer risk through meta-analyses . METHODS We reviewed breast cancer studies published from January 1966 to February 2007 that included data on birth weight , birth order , maternal age , gestational age , twin status , and maternal or paternal smoking . Meta-analyses using random effect models were employed to summarize the results . RESULTS We found that heavier birth weights were associated with increased breast cancer risk , with studies involving five categories of birth weight identifying odds ratios ( ORs ) of 1.24 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.04 to 1.48 ) for 4,000 g or more and 1.15 ( 95 % CI 1.04 to 1.26 ) for 3,500 g to 3,999 g , relative to a birth weight of 2,500 to 2,599 g. These studies provided no support for a J-shaped relationship of birthweight to risk . Support for an association with birthweight was also derived from studies based on three birth weight categories ( OR 1.15 [ 95 % CI 1.01 to 1.31 ] for > or = 4,000 g relative to < 3,000 g ) and two birth weight categories ( OR 1.09 [ 95 % CI 1.02 to 1.18 ] for > or = 3,000 g relative to < 3,000 g ) . Women born to older mothers and twins were also at some increased risk , but the results were heterogeneous across studies and publication years . Birth order , prematurity , and maternal smoking were unrelated to breast cancer risk . CONCLUSION Our findings provide some support for the hypothesis that in utero exposures reflective of higher endogenous hormone levels could affect risk for development of breast cancer in adulthood . BACKGROUND Emerging evidence suggests an association between female prenatal experience and her subsequent risk of developing breast cancer . Potential underlying mechanisms include variation in amounts of maternal endogenous sex hormones and growth hormones , germ-cell mutations , formation of cancer stem-cells , and other genetic or epigenetic events . We reviewed and summarised quantitatively the available data on intrauterine exposures and risk of breast cancer . METHODS We systematically searched for studies that assessed association between perinatal factors and risk of breast cancer . We reviewed separately each of the perinatal factors , including birthweight , birth length , parental age at delivery , gestational age , intrauterine exposure to diethylstilbestrol , twin membership , maternal pre-eclampsia or eclampsia , and other factors . FINDINGS We identified 57 studies published between Oct 1 , 1980 , and June 21 , 2007 . Increased risk of breast cancer was noted with increased birthweight ( relative risk [ RR ] 1.15 [ 95 % CI 1.09 - 1.21 ] ) , birth length ( 1.28 [ 1.11 - 1.48 ] ) , higher maternal age ( 1.13 [ 1.02 - 1.25 ] ) , and paternal age ( 1.12 [ 1.05 - 1.19 ] ) . Decreased risk of breast cancer was noted for maternal pre-eclampsia and eclampsia ( 0.48 [ 0.30 - 0.78 ] ) and twin membership ( 0.93 [ 0.87 - 1.00 ] ) . No association was noted between risk of breast cancer and gestational age at birth ( 0.95 [ 0.71 - 1.26 ] ) or maternal diethylstilbestrol treatment ( 1.40 [ 0.86 - 2.28 ] ) . INTERPRETATION The intrauterine environment contributes to the predisposition of women to breast cancer in adulthood . The in-utero mechanisms responsible for such predisposition need to be elucidated .

57,"Inhibiting glucose-6-phospate dehydrogenase improves lipogenesis by deactivating LKB1-AMPK signaling. [SEP] The oxidative pentose phosphate pathway ( PPP ) contributes to tumour growth , but the precise contribution of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase ( 6PGD ) , the third enzyme in this pathway , to tumorigenesis remains unclear . We found that suppression of 6PGD decreased lipogenesis and RNA biosynthesis and elevated ROS levels in cancer cells , attenuating cell proliferation and tumour growth . 6PGD-mediated production of ribulose-5-phosphate ( Ru-5-P ) inhibits AMPK activation by disrupting the active LKB1 complex , thereby activating acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 and lipogenesis . Ru-5-P and NADPH are thought to be precursors in RNA biosynthesis and lipogenesis , respectively ; thus , our findings provide an additional link between the oxidative PPP and lipogenesis through Ru-5-P-dependent inhibition of LKB1-AMPK signalling .

T cells are integral to adaptive immunity ; mouse studies indicate that tissue localization of T cell subsets is important for both protective immunity and immunoregulation . In humans , however , the early development and function of T cells in tissues remain unexplored . We present here an analysis of lymphoid and mucosal tissue T cells derived from pediatric organ donors in the first two years of life , as compared to adult organ donors , revealing early compartmentalization of T cell differentiation and regulation . Whereas adult tissues contain a predominance of memory T cells , in pediatric blood and tissues the main subset consists of naive recent thymic emigrants , with effector memory T cells ( T(EM ) ) found only in the lungs and small intestine . Additionally , regulatory T ( T(reg ) ) cells comprise a high proportion ( 30 - 40 % ) of CD4(+ ) T cells in pediatric tissues but are present at much lower frequencies ( 1 - 10 % ) in adult tissues .

59,"BRCA 1 mutation carriers' risk of breast and ovarian cancer depends on where the mutation is located. [SEP] IMPORTANCE Limited information about the relationship between specific mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 ( BRCA1/2 ) and cancer risk exists . OBJECTIVE To identify mutation-specific cancer risks for carriers of BRCA1/2 . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Observational study of women who were ascertained between 1937 and 2011 ( median , 1999 ) and found to carry disease-associated BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations . The international sample comprised 19,581 carriers of BRCA1 mutations and 11,900 carriers of BRCA2 mutations from 55 centers in 33 countries on 6 continents . We estimated hazard ratios for breast and ovarian cancer based on mutation type , function , and nucleotide position . We also estimated RHR , the ratio of breast vs ovarian cancer hazard ratios . A value of RHR greater than 1 indicated elevated breast cancer risk ; a value of RHR less than 1 indicated elevated ovarian cancer risk . EXPOSURES Mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Breast and ovarian cancer risks . RESULTS Among BRCA1 mutation carriers , 9052 women ( 46 % ) were diagnosed with breast cancer , 2317 ( 12 % ) with ovarian cancer , 1041 ( 5 % ) with breast and ovarian cancer , and 7171 ( 37 % ) without cancer . Among BRCA2 mutation carriers , 6180 women ( 52 % ) were diagnosed with breast cancer , 682 ( 6 % ) with ovarian cancer , 272 ( 2 % ) with breast and ovarian cancer , and 4766 ( 40 % ) without cancer . In BRCA1 , we identified 3 breast cancer cluster regions ( BCCRs ) located at c.179 to c.505 ( BCCR1 ; RHR = 1.46 ; 95 % CI , 1.22 - 1.74 ; P = 2 × 10(-6 ) ) , c.4328 to c.4945 ( BCCR2 ; RHR = 1.34 ; 95 % CI , 1.01 - 1.78 ; P = .04 ) , and c. 5261 to c.5563 ( BCCR2 ' , RHR = 1.38 ; 95 % CI , 1.22 - 1.55 ; P = 6 × 10(-9 ) ) . We also identified an ovarian cancer cluster region ( OCCR ) from c.1380 to c.4062 ( approximately exon 11 ) with RHR = 0.62 ( 95 % CI , 0.56 - 0.70 ; P = 9 × 10(-17 ) ) . In BRCA2 , we observed multiple BCCRs spanning c.1 to c.596 ( BCCR1 ; RHR = 1.71 ; 95 % CI , 1.06 - 2.78 ; P = .03 ) , c.772 to c.1806 ( BCCR1 ' ; RHR = 1.63 ; 95 % CI , 1.10 - 2.40 ; P = .01 ) , and c.7394 to c.8904 ( BCCR2 ; RHR = 2.31 ; 95 % CI , 1.69 - 3.16 ; P = .00002 ) . We also identified 3 OCCRs : the first ( OCCR1 ) spanned c.3249 to c.5681 that was adjacent to c.5946delT ( 6174delT ; RHR = 0.51 ; 95 % CI , 0.44 - 0.60 ; P = 6 × 10(-17 ) ) . The second OCCR spanned c.6645 to c.7471 ( OCCR2 ; RHR = 0.57 ; 95 % CI , 0.41 - 0.80 ; P = .001 ) . Mutations conferring nonsense-mediated decay were associated with differential breast or ovarian cancer risks and an earlier age of breast cancer diagnosis for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers .

[SEP] Recent findings challenge the concept that microglia solely function in disease states in the central nervous system ( CNS ) . Rather than simply reacting to CNS injury , infection , or pathology , emerging lines of evidence indicate that microglia sculpt the structure of the CNS , refine neuronal circuitry and network connectivity , and contribute to plasticity . These physiological functions of microglia in the normal CNS begin during development and persist into maturity .

SETTING 20 general practices in the West Midlands and south east England . PARTICIPANTS 20 general practitioners and 35 consulting patients . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Misunderstandings between patients and doctors that have potential or actual adverse consequences for taking medicine . RESULTS 14 categories of misunderstanding were identified relating to patient information unknown to the doctor , doctor information unknown to the patient , conflicting information , disagreement about attribution of side effects , failure of communication about doctor 's decision , and relationship factors . All the misunderstandings were associated with lack of patients ' participation in the consultation in terms of the voicing of expectations and preferences or the voicing of responses to doctors ' decisions and actions . They were all associated with potential or actual adverse outcomes such as non-adherence to treatment . Many were based on inaccurate guesses and assumptions . In particular doctors seemed unaware of the relevance of patients ' ideas about medicines for successful prescribing .

63,"The one-child policy has created a hospitable environment for female infants. [SEP] OBJECTIVES To explore the use of local civil registration data to assess the perinatal mortality in a typical rural county in a less developed province in China , 1999 - 2000 . DESIGN Retrospective cohort study . Pregnancies in a cohort of women followed from registration of pregnancy to outcome of infant seven days after birth . SETTING Routine family planning records in 20 rural townships in eastern China . SUBJECTS 3697 pregnancies registered by the local family planning system during 1999 . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Abortions , stillbirths , early neonatal mortality , perinatal mortality . RESULTS Only three cases were lost to follow up . The average age of the women at pregnancy was 25.9 years . Three hundred and twelve pregnancies were aborted and 240 ended in miscarriage ( total 552 , 15 % ) . The perinatal mortality rate was 69 per 1000 births , the rate of stillbirth was 24 per 1000 births , and the early neonatal mortality was 46 per 1000 live births . The early neonatal mortality was 29 in boys and 69 in girls per 1000 live births . The perinatal mortality rate increased notably with parity and was higher in townships having lower income per capita . CONCLUSIONS The family planning system at the most local level is a useful data source for studying perinatal mortality in rural China .

64,"Omnivores produce less trimethylamine N-oxide from dietary I-carnitine than vegans. [SEP] Intestinal microbiota metabolism of choline and phosphatidylcholine produces trimethylamine ( TMA ) , which is further metabolized to a proatherogenic species , trimethylamine-N-oxide ( TMAO ) . We demonstrate here that metabolism by intestinal microbiota of dietary L-carnitine , a trimethylamine abundant in red meat , also produces TMAO and accelerates atherosclerosis in mice . Omnivorous human subjects produced more TMAO than did vegans or vegetarians following ingestion of L-carnitine through a microbiota-dependent mechanism . The presence of specific bacterial taxa in human feces was associated with both plasma TMAO concentration and dietary status . Plasma L-carnitine levels in subjects undergoing cardiac evaluation ( n = 2,595 ) predicted increased risks for both prevalent cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) and incident major adverse cardiac events ( myocardial infarction , stroke or death ) , but only among subjects with concurrently high TMAO levels . Chronic dietary L-carnitine supplementation in mice altered cecal microbial composition , markedly enhanced synthesis of TMA and TMAO , and increased atherosclerosis , but this did not occur if intestinal microbiota was concurrently suppressed . In mice with an intact intestinal microbiota , dietary supplementation with TMAO or either carnitine or choline reduced in vivo reverse cholesterol transport . Intestinal microbiota may thus contribute to the well-established link between high levels of red meat consumption and CVD risk .

65,"Varying expression levels of EBI2 affect the positioning and migration of B cells. [SEP] EBI2 , aka GPR183 , is a G-couple receptor originally identified in 1993 as one of main genes induced in Burkitt 's lymphoma cell line BL41 by Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infection . After it was reported in 2009 that the receptor played a key role in regulating B cell migration and responses , we initiated an effort in looking for its endogenous ligand . In 2011 we and another group reported the identification of 7α , 25-dihydroxyxcholesterol ( 7α , 25-OHC ) , an oxysterol , as the likely physiological ligand of EBI2 . A few subsequently published studies further elucidated how 7α , 25-OHC bound to EBI2 , and how a gradient of 7α , 25-OHC could be generated in vivo and regulated migration , activation , and functions of B cells , T cells , dendritic cells ( DCs ) , monocytes/macrophages , and astrocytes . The identification of 7α , 25-OHC as a G protein-coupled receptor ligand revealed a previously unknown signaling system of oxysterols , a class of molecules which exert profound biological functions . Dysregulation of the synthesis or functions of these molecules is believed to contribute to inflammation and autoimmune diseases , cardiovascular diseases , neurodegenerative diseases , cancer as well as metabolic diseases such as diabetes , obesity , and dyslipidemia . Therefore EBI2 may represent a promising target for therapeutic interventions for human diseases . Humoral immunity depends on both rapid and long-term antibody production against invading pathogens . This is achieved by the generation of spatially distinct extrafollicular plasmablast and follicular germinal center ( GC ) B cell populations , but the signals that guide responding B cells to these alternative compartments have not been fully elucidated . Here , we show that expression of the orphan G protein-coupled receptor Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 ( EBI2 , also known as GPR183 ) by activated B cells was essential for their movement to extrafollicular sites and induction of early plasmablast responses . Conversely , downregulation of EBI2 enabled B cells to access the center of follicles and promoted efficient GC formation . EBI2 therefore provides a previously uncharacterized dimension to B cell migration that is crucial for coordinating rapid versus long-term antibody responses .

66,"A breast cancer patient's capacity to metabolize tamoxifen influences treatment outcome. [SEP] CONTEXT The growth inhibitory effect of tamoxifen , which is used for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer , is mediated by its metabolites , 4-hydroxytamoxifen and endoxifen . The formation of active metabolites is catalyzed by the polymorphic cytochrome P450 2D6 ( CYP2D6 ) enzyme . OBJECTIVE To determine whether CYP2D6 variation is associated with clinical outcomes in women receiving adjuvant tamoxifen . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PATIENTS Retrospective analysis of German and US cohorts of patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen for early stage breast cancer . The 1325 patients had diagnoses between 1986 and 2005 of stage I through III breast cancer and were mainly postmenopausal ( 95.4 % ) . Last follow-up was in December 2008 ; inclusion criteria were hormone receptor positivity , no metastatic disease at diagnosis , adjuvant tamoxifen therapy , and no chemotherapy . DNA from tumor tissue or blood was genotyped for CYP2D6 variants associated with reduced ( * 10 , * 41 ) or absent ( * 3 , * 4 , * 5 ) enzyme activity . Women were classified as having an extensive ( n=609 ) , heterozygous extensive/intermediate ( n=637 ) , or poor ( n=79 ) CYP2D6 metabolism . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Time to recurrence , event-free survival , disease-free survival , and overall survival . RESULTS Median follow-up was 6.3 years . At 9 years of follow-up , the recurrence rates were 14.9 % for extensive metabolizers , 20.9 % for heterozygous extensive/intermediate metabolizers , and 29.0 % for poor metabolizers , and all-cause mortality rates were 16.7 % , 18.0 % , and 22.8 % , respectively . Compared with extensive metabolizers , there was a significantly increased risk of recurrence for heterozygous extensive/intermediate metabolizers ( time to recurrence adjusted hazard ratio [ HR ] , 1.40 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.04 - 1.90 ) and for poor metabolizers ( time to recurrence HR , 1.90 ; 95 % CI , 1.10 - 3.28 ) . Compared with extensive metabolizers , those with decreased CYP2D6 activity ( heterozygous extensive/intermediate and poor metabolism ) had worse event-free survival ( HR , 1.33 ; 95 % CI , 1.06 - 1.68 ) and disease-free survival ( HR , 1.29 ; 95 % CI , 1.03 - 1.61 ) , but there was no significant difference in overall survival ( HR , 1.15 ; 95 % CI , 0.88 - 1.51 ) . CONCLUSION Among women with breast cancer treated with tamoxifen , there was an association between CYP2D6 variation and clinical outcomes , such that the presence of 2 functional CYP2D6 alleles was associated with better clinical outcomes and the presence of nonfunctional or reduced-function alleles with worse outcomes .

67,"Replacement of histone H2A with H2A.Z accelerates gene activation in yeasts by destabilizing +1 nucleosomes. [SEP] Nucleosomes containing the histone variant H3.3 tend to be clustered in vivo in the neighborhood of transcriptionally active genes and over regulatory elements . It has not been clear , however , whether H3.3-containing nucleosomes possess unique properties that would affect transcription . We report here that H3.3 nucleosomes isolated from vertebrates , regardless of whether they are partnered with H2A or H2A.Z , are unusually sensitive to salt-dependent disruption , losing H2A/H2B or H2A.Z/H2B dimers . Immunoprecipitation studies of nucleosome core particles ( NCPs ) show that NCPs that contain both H3.3 and H2A.Z are even less stable than NCPs containing H3.3 and H2A . Intriguingly , NCPs containing H3 and H2A.Z are at least as stable as H3/H2A NCPs . These results establish an hierarchy of stabilities for native nucleosomes carrying different complements of variants , and suggest how H2A.Z could play different roles depending on its partners within the NCP . They also are consistent with the idea that H3.3 plays an active role in maintaining accessible chromatin structures in enhancer regions and transcribed regions . Consistent with this idea , promoters and enhancers at transcriptionally active genes and coding regions at highly expressed genes have nucleosomes that simultaneously carry both H3.3 and H2A.Z , and should therefore be extremely sensitive to disruption .

68,"Female carriers of the Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele have shorter lifetime exposure to estrogen due to a decreased reproductive period. [SEP] CONTEXT Exogenous estrogen use may lower risk of dementia in postmenopausal women . A relationship between long-term exposure to endogenous estrogens and incident dementia has been hypothesized but not studied . OBJECTIVE To determine whether a longer reproductive period , as an indicator of longer exposure to endogenous estrogens , is associated with lower risk of dementia and Alzheimer disease ( AD ) in women who have natural menopause . DESIGN AND SETTING The Rotterdam Study , a population-based prospective cohort study conducted in the Netherlands . PARTICIPANTS A total of 3601 women aged 55 years or older who did not have dementia at baseline ( 1990 - 1993 ) and had information on age at menarche , age at menopause , and type of menopause . Participants were reexamined in 1993 - 1994 and 1997 - 1999 and were continuously monitored for development of dementia . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Incidence of dementia , based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Revised Third Edition criteria , and AD , based on National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer 's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria , compared by quartiles of reproductive period among women with natural menopause . RESULTS During 21 046 person-years of follow-up ( median follow-up , 6.3 years ) , 199 women developed dementia , including 159 who developed AD . After adjusting for age , dementia was not clearly associated with length of reproductive period . However , after adjusting for multiple covariates , women with natural menopause and more reproductive years had an increased risk of dementia ( adjusted rate ratio [ RR ] for women with > 39 reproductive years [ highest quartile ] compared with < 34 reproductive years [ lowest quartile ] , 1.78 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.12 - 2.84 ) . The adjusted RR per year of increase was 1.04 ( 95 % CI , 1.01 - 1.08 ) . For risk of AD , the adjusted RRs were 1.51 ( 95 % CI , 0.91 - 2.50 ) and 1.03 ( 95 % CI , 1.00 - 1.07 ) , respectively . Risk of dementia associated with a longer reproductive period was most pronounced in APOE epsilon4 carriers ( adjusted RR for > 39 reproductive years compared with < 34 reproductive years , 4.20 [ 95 % CI , 1.97 - 8.92 ] for dementia and 3.42 [ 95 % CI , 1.51 - 7.75 ] for AD ) , whereas in noncarriers , no clear association with dementia or AD was observed .

[SEP] CONTEXT Risedronate , a potent bisphosphonate , has been shown to be effective in the treatment of Paget disease of bone and other metabolic bone diseases but , to our knowledge , it has not been evaluated in the treatment of established postmenopausal osteoporosis . OBJECTIVE To test the efficacy and safety of daily treatment with risedronate to reduce the risk of vertebral and other fractures in postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial of 2458 ambulatory postmenopausal women younger than 85 years with at least 1 vertebral fracture at baseline who were enrolled at 1 of 110 centers in North America conducted between December 1993 and January 1998 . INTERVENTIONS Subjects were randomly assigned to receive oral treatment for 3 years with risedronate ( 2.5 or 5 mg/d ) or placebo . All subjects received calcium , 1000 mg/d . Vitamin D ( cholecalciferol , up to 500 IU/d ) was provided if baseline levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were low . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Incidence of new vertebral fractures as detected by quantitative and semiquantitative assessments of radiographs ; incidence of radiographically confirmed nonvertebral fractures and change from baseline in bone mineral density as determined by dual x-ray absorptiometry . RESULTS The 2.5 mg/d of risedronate arm was discontinued after 1 year ; in the placebo and 5 mg/d of risedronate arms , 450 and 489 subjects , respectively , completed all 3 years of the trial . Treatment with 5 mg/d of risedronate , compared with placebo , decreased the cumulative incidence of new vertebral fractures by 41 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 18%-58 % ) over 3 years ( 11.3 % vs 16.3 % ; P= .003 ) . A fracture reduction of 65 % ( 95 % CI , 38%-81 % ) was observed after the first year ( 2.4 % vs 6.4 % ; P<.001 ) . The cumulative incidence of nonvertebral fractures over 3 years was reduced by 39 % ( 95 % CI , 6%-61 % ) ( 5.2 % vs 8.4 % ; P = .02 ) . Bone mineral density increased significantly compared with placebo at the lumbar spine ( 5.4 % vs 1.1 % ) , femoral neck ( 1.6 % vs -1.2 % ) , femoral trochanter ( 3.3 % vs -0.7 % ) , and midshaft of the radius ( 0.2 % vs -1.4 % ) .

70,"Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is not predictive of acute respiratory failure after solid organ transplantation. [SEP] CONTEXT Noninvasive ventilation ( NIV ) has been associated with lower rates of endotracheal intubation in populations of patients with acute respiratory failure . OBJECTIVE To compare NIV with standard treatment using supplemental oxygen administration to avoid endotracheal intubation in recipients of solid organ transplantation with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure . DESIGN AND SETTING Prospective randomized study conducted at a 14-bed , general intensive care unit of a university hospital . PATIENTS Of 238 patients who underwent solid organ transplantation from December 1995 to October 1997 , 51 were treated for acute respiratory failure . Of these , 40 were eligible and 20 were randomized to each group . INTERVENTION Noninvasive ventilation vs standard treatment with supplemental oxygen administration . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The need for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation at any time during the study , complications not present on admission , duration of ventilatory assistance , length of hospital stay , and intensive care unit mortality . RESULTS The 2 groups were similar at study entry . Within the first hour of treatment , 14 patients ( 70 % ) in the NIV group , and 5 patients ( 25 % ) in the standard treatment group improved their ratio of the PaO2 to the fraction of inspired oxygen ( FIO2 ) . Over time , a sustained improvement in PaO2 to FIO2 was noted in 12 patients ( 60 % ) in the NIV group , and in 5 patients ( 25 % ) randomized to standard treatment ( P = .03 ) . The use of NIV was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of endotracheal intubation ( 20 % vs 70 % ; P = .002 ) , rate of fatal complications ( 20 % vs 50 % ; P = .05 ) , length of stay in the intensive care unit by survivors ( mean [ SD ] days , 5.5 [ 3 ] vs 9 [ 4 ] ; P = .03 ) , and intensive care unit mortality ( 20 % vs 50 % ; P = .05 ) . Hospital mortality did not differ .

But it may not be that simple . The idea that reducing antibiotic use would redress the problem formed part of a positive response on the part of the United Kingdom government to the House of Lords report,1 including a public information campaign , surveillance of resistance along the food chain , targets with respect to hospital acquired infections , and setting up of an overarching advisory body on all aspects of antibiotic use .

72,"Cost effectiveness evaluations based on cRCT data lack external validity. [SEP] BACKGROUND Data on absolute risks of outcomes and patterns of drug use in cost-effectiveness analyses are often based on randomised clinical trials ( RCTs ) . The objective of this study was to evaluate the external validity of published cost-effectiveness studies by comparing the data used in these studies ( typically based on RCTs ) to observational data from actual clinical practice . Selective Cox-2 inhibitors ( coxibs ) were used as an example . METHODS AND FINDINGS The UK General Practice Research Database ( GPRD ) was used to estimate the exposure characteristics and individual probabilities of upper gastrointestinal ( GI ) events during current exposure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) or coxibs . A basic cost-effectiveness model was developed evaluating two alternative strategies : prescription of a conventional NSAID or coxib . Outcomes included upper GI events as recorded in GPRD and hospitalisation for upper GI events recorded in the national registry of hospitalisations ( Hospital Episode Statistics ) linked to GPRD . Prescription costs were based on the prescribed number of tables as recorded in GPRD and the 2006 cost data from the British National Formulary . The study population included over 1 million patients prescribed conventional NSAIDs or coxibs . Only a minority of patients used the drugs long-term and daily ( 34.5 % of conventional NSAIDs and 44.2 % of coxibs ) , whereas coxib RCTs required daily use for at least 6 - 9 months . The mean cost of preventing one upper GI event as recorded in GPRD was US$ 104k ( ranging from US$ 64k with long-term daily use to US$ 182k with intermittent use ) and US$ 298k for hospitalizations . The mean costs ( for GPRD events ) over calendar time were US$ 58k during 1990 - 1993 and US$ 174k during 2002 - 2005 . Using RCT data rather than GPRD data for event probabilities , the mean cost was US$ 16k with the VIGOR RCT and US$ 20k with the CLASS RCT . CONCLUSIONS The published cost-effectiveness analyses of coxibs lacked external validity , did not represent patients in actual clinical practice , and should not have been used to inform prescribing policies . External validity should be an explicit requirement for cost-effectiveness analyses .

73,"In S. cerevisiae, the absence of RNA surveillance pathways reduces sensitivity to high iron conditions. [SEP] Tight regulation of the expression of mRNAs encoding iron uptake proteins is essential to control iron homeostasis and avoid intracellular iron toxicity . We show that many mRNAs encoding iron uptake or iron mobilization proteins are expressed in iron-replete conditions in the absence of the S. cerevisiae RNase III ortholog Rnt1p or of the nuclear exosome component Rrp6p . Extended forms of these mRNAs accumulate in the absence of Rnt1p or of the 5'-->3 ' exonucleases Xrn1p and Rat1p , showing that multiple degradative pathways contribute to the surveillance of aberrant forms of these transcripts . RNase III-deficient cells are hypersensitive to high iron concentrations , suggesting that Rnt1p-mediated RNA surveillance is required to prevent iron toxicity .

74,"One in five surgical randomized controlled trials are discontinued early. [SEP] OBJECTIVE To determine the rate of early discontinuation and non-publication of randomised controlled trials involving patients undergoing surgery . DESIGN Cross sectional observational study of registered and published trials . SETTING Randomised controlled trials of interventions in patients undergoing a surgical procedure . DATA SOURCES The ClinicalTrials.gov database was searched for interventional trials registered between January 2008 and December 2009 using the keyword "" surgery "" . Recruitment status was extracted from the ClinicalTrials.gov database . A systematic search for studies published in peer reviewed journals was performed ; if they were not found , results posted on the ClinicalTrials.gov results database were sought . Email queries were sent to trial investigators of discontinued and unpublished completed trials if no reason for the respective status was disclosed . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Trial discontinuation before completion and non-publication after completion . Logistic regression was used to determine the effect of funding source on publication status , with adjustment for intervention type and trial size . RESULTS Of 818 registered trials found using the keyword "" surgery "" , 395 met the inclusion criteria . Of these , 21 % ( 81/395 ) were discontinued early , most commonly owing to poor recruitment ( 44 % , 36/81 ) . The remaining 314 ( 79 % ) trials proceeded to completion , with a publication rate of 66 % ( 208/314 ) at a median time of 4.9 ( interquartile range 4.0 - 6.0 ) years from study completion to publication search . A further 6 % ( 20/314 ) of studies presented results on ClinicalTrials.gov without a corresponding peer reviewed publication . Industry funding did not affect the rate of discontinuation ( adjusted odds ratio 0.91 , 95 % confidence interval 0.54 to 1.55 ) but was associated with a lower odds of publication for completed trials ( 0.43 , 0.26 to 0.72 ) . Investigators ' email addresses for trials with an uncertain fate were identified for 71.4 % ( 10/14 ) of discontinued trials and 83 % ( 101/122 ) of unpublished studies . Only 43 % ( 6/14 ) and 20 % ( 25/122 ) replies were received . Email responses for completed trials indicated 11 trials in press , five published studies ( four in non-indexed peer reviewed journals ) , and nine trials remaining unpublished . CONCLUSIONS One in five surgical randomised controlled trials are discontinued early , one in three completed trials remain unpublished , and investigators of unpublished studies are frequently not contactable .

75,"76-85% of people with severe mental disorder receive no treatment in low and middle income countries. [SEP] CONTEXT Little is known about the extent or severity of untreated mental disorders , especially in less-developed countries . OBJECTIVE To estimate prevalence , severity , and treatment of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition ( DSM-IV ) mental disorders in 14 countries ( 6 less developed , 8 developed ) in the World Health Organization ( WHO ) World Mental Health ( WMH ) Survey Initiative . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Face-to-face household surveys of 60 463 community adults conducted from 2001 - 2003 in 14 countries in the Americas , Europe , the Middle East , Africa , and Asia . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The DSM-IV disorders , severity , and treatment were assessed with the WMH version of the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview ( WMH-CIDI ) , a fully structured , lay-administered psychiatric diagnostic interview . RESULTS The prevalence of having any WMH-CIDI/DSM-IV disorder in the prior year varied widely , from 4.3 % in Shanghai to 26.4 % in the United States , with an interquartile range ( IQR ) of 9.1%-16.9 % . Between 33.1 % ( Colombia ) and 80.9 % ( Nigeria ) of 12-month cases were mild ( IQR , 40.2%-53.3 % ) . Serious disorders were associated with substantial role disability . Although disorder severity was correlated with probability of treatment in almost all countries , 35.5 % to 50.3 % of serious cases in developed countries and 76.3 % to 85.4 % in less-developed countries received no treatment in the 12 months before the interview . Due to the high prevalence of mild and subthreshold cases , the number of those who received treatment far exceeds the number of untreated serious cases in every country . CONCLUSIONS Reallocation of treatment resources could substantially decrease the problem of unmet need for treatment of mental disorders among serious cases . Structural barriers exist to this reallocation . Careful consideration needs to be given to the value of treating some mild cases , especially those at risk for progressing to more serious disorders .

76,"mcm 5 s 2 U is required for proper decoding of NNR codons in eukaryotes. [SEP] The wobble modification in tRNAs , 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine ( mcm(5)s(2)U ) , is required for the proper decoding of NNR codons in eukaryotes . The 2-thio group confers conformational rigidity of mcm(5)s(2)U by largely fixing the C3'-endo ribose puckering , ensuring stable and accurate codon-anticodon pairing . We have identified five genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , YIL008w ( URM1 ) , YHR111w ( UBA4 ) , YOR251c ( TUM1 ) , YNL119w ( NCS2 ) and YGL211w ( NCS6 ) , that are required for 2-thiolation of mcm(5)s(2)U. An in vitro sulfur transfer experiment revealed that Tum1p stimulated the cysteine desulfurase of Nfs1p , and accepted persulfide sulfurs from Nfs1p . URM1 is a ubiquitin-related modifier , and UBA4 is an E1-like enzyme involved in protein urmylation . The carboxy-terminus of Urm1p was activated as an acyl-adenylate ( -COAMP ) , then thiocarboxylated ( -COSH ) by Uba4p . The activated thiocarboxylate can be utilized in the subsequent reactions for 2-thiouridine formation , mediated by Ncs2p/Ncs6p . We could successfully reconstitute the 2-thiouridine formation in vitro using recombinant proteins . This study revealed that 2-thiouridine formation shares a pathway and chemical reactions with protein urmylation . The sulfur-flow of eukaryotic 2-thiouridine formation is distinct mechanism from the bacterial sulfur-relay system which is based on the persulfide chemistry .

77,"Natriuretic peptides protect against diabetes. [SEP] BACKGROUND Genetic and epidemiological evidence suggests an inverse association between B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) levels in blood and risk of type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) , but the prospective association of BNP with T2D is uncertain , and it is unclear whether the association is confounded . METHODS AND FINDINGS We analysed the association between levels of the N-terminal fragment of pro-BNP ( NT-pro-BNP ) in blood and risk of incident T2D in a prospective case-cohort study and genotyped the variant rs198389 within the BNP locus in three T2D case-control studies . We combined our results with existing data in a meta-analysis of 11 case-control studies . Using a Mendelian randomization approach , we compared the observed association between rs198389 and T2D to that expected from the NT-pro-BNP level to T2D association and the NT-pro-BNP difference per C allele of rs198389 . In participants of our case-cohort study who were free of T2D and cardiovascular disease at baseline , we observed a 21 % ( 95 % CI 3%-36 % ) decreased risk of incident T2D per one standard deviation ( SD ) higher log-transformed NT-pro-BNP levels in analysis adjusted for age , sex , body mass index , systolic blood pressure , smoking , family history of T2D , history of hypertension , and levels of triglycerides , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol , and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol . The association between rs198389 and T2D observed in case-control studies ( odds ratio = 0.94 per C allele , 95 % CI 0.91 - 0.97 ) was similar to that expected ( 0.96 , 0.93 - 0.98 ) based on the pooled estimate for the log-NT-pro-BNP level to T2D association derived from a meta-analysis of our study and published data ( hazard ratio = 0.82 per SD , 0.74 - 0.90 ) and the difference in NT-pro-BNP levels ( 0.22 SD , 0.15 - 0.29 ) per C allele of rs198389 . No significant associations were observed between the rs198389 genotype and potential confounders . CONCLUSIONS Our results provide evidence for a potential causal role of the BNP system in the aetiology of T2D .

78,"Systemic lupus erythematosus is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. [SEP] Objectives To develop and validate updated QRISK3 prediction algorithms to estimate the 10 year risk of cardiovascular disease in women and men accounting for potential new risk factors . Design Prospective open cohort study . Setting General practices in England providing data for the QResearch database . Participants 1309 QResearch general practices in England : 981 practices were used to develop the scores and a separate set of 328 practices were used to validate the scores . 7.89 million patients aged 25 - 84 years were in the derivation cohort and 2.67 million patients in the validation cohort . Patients were free of cardiovascular disease and not prescribed statins at baseline . Methods Cox proportional hazards models in the derivation cohort to derive separate risk equations in men and women for evaluation at 10 years . Risk factors considered included those already in QRISK2 ( age , ethnicity , deprivation , systolic blood pressure , body mass index , total cholesterol : high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio , smoking , family history of coronary heart disease in a first degree relative aged less than 60 years , type 1 diabetes , type 2 diabetes , treated hypertension , rheumatoid arthritis , atrial fibrillation , chronic kidney disease ( stage 4 or 5 ) ) and new risk factors ( chronic kidney disease ( stage 3 , 4 , or 5 ) , a measure of systolic blood pressure variability ( standard deviation of repeated measures ) , migraine , corticosteroids , systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , atypical antipsychotics , severe mental illness , and HIV/AIDs ) . We also considered erectile dysfunction diagnosis or treatment in men . Measures of calibration and discrimination were determined in the validation cohort for men and women separately and for individual subgroups by age group , ethnicity , and baseline disease status . Main outcome measures Incident cardiovascular disease recorded on any of the following three linked data sources : general practice , mortality , or hospital admission records . Results 363 565 incident cases of cardiovascular disease were identified in the derivation cohort during follow-up arising from 50.8 million person years of observation . All new risk factors considered met the model inclusion criteria except for HIV/AIDS , which was not statistically significant . The models had good calibration and high levels of explained variation and discrimination . In women , the algorithm explained 59.6 % of the variation in time to diagnosis of cardiovascular disease ( R2 , with higher values indicating more variation ) , and the D statistic was 2.48 and Harrell 's C statistic was 0.88 ( both measures of discrimination , with higher values indicating better discrimination ) . The corresponding values for men were 54.8 % , 2.26 , and 0.86 . Overall performance of the updated QRISK3 algorithms was similar to the QRISK2 algorithms .

79,"Knockout proximal tubule-specific deletion of the BMP receptor Alk3 causes epithelial damage. [SEP] Molecules associated with the transforming growth factor β ( TGF-β ) superfamily , such as bone morphogenic proteins ( BMPs ) and TGF-β , are key regulators of inflammation , apoptosis and cellular transitions . Here we show that the BMP receptor activin-like kinase 3 ( Alk3 ) is elevated early in diseased kidneys after injury . We also found that its deletion in the tubular epithelium leads to enhanced TGF-β1-Smad family member 3 ( Smad3 ) signaling , epithelial damage and fibrosis , suggesting a protective role for Alk3-mediated signaling in the kidney . A structure-function analysis of the BMP-Alk3-BMP receptor , type 2 ( BMPR2 ) ligand-receptor complex , along with synthetic organic chemistry , led us to construct a library of small peptide agonists of BMP signaling that function through the Alk3 receptor . One such peptide agonist , THR-123 , suppressed inflammation , apoptosis and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition program and reversed established fibrosis in five mouse models of acute and chronic renal injury . THR-123 acts specifically through Alk3 signaling , as mice with a targeted deletion for Alk3 in their tubular epithelium did not respond to therapy with THR-123 . Combining THR-123 and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril had an additive therapeutic benefit in controlling renal fibrosis . Our studies show that BMP signaling agonists constitute a new line of therapeutic agents with potential utility in the clinic to induce regeneration , repair and reverse established fibrosis .

80,"Whole brain radiotherapy increases the occurrence of new brain metastases. [SEP] CONTEXT In patients with brain metastases , it is unclear whether adding up-front whole-brain radiation therapy ( WBRT ) to stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) has beneficial effects on mortality or neurologic function compared with SRS alone . OBJECTIVE To determine if WBRT combined with SRS results in improvements in survival , brain tumor control , functional preservation rate , and frequency of neurologic death . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PATIENTS Randomized controlled trial of 132 patients with 1 to 4 brain metastases , each less than 3 cm in diameter , enrolled at 11 hospitals in Japan between October 1999 and December 2003 . INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to receive WBRT plus SRS ( 65 patients ) or SRS alone ( 67 patients ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary end point was overall survival ; secondary end points were brain tumor recurrence , salvage brain treatment , functional preservation , toxic effects of radiation , and cause of death . RESULTS The median survival time and the 1-year actuarial survival rate were 7.5 months and 38.5 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 26.7%-50.3 % ) in the WBRT + SRS group and 8.0 months and 28.4 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 17.6%-39.2 % ) for SRS alone ( P = .42 ) . The 12-month brain tumor recurrence rate was 46.8 % in the WBRT + SRS group and 76.4 % for SRS alone group ( P<.001 ) . Salvage brain treatment was less frequently required in the WBRT + SRS group ( n = 10 ) than with SRS alone ( n = 29 ) ( P<.001 ) . Death was attributed to neurologic causes in 22.8 % of patients in the WBRT + SRS group and in 19.3 % of those treated with SRS alone ( P = .64 ) . There were no significant differences in systemic and neurologic functional preservation and toxic effects of radiation . CONCLUSIONS Compared with SRS alone , the use of WBRT plus SRS did not improve survival for patients with 1 to 4 brain metastases , but intracranial relapse occurred considerably more frequently in those who did not receive WBRT . Consequently , salvage treatment is frequently required when up-front WBRT is not used . TRIAL REGISTRATION umin.ac.jp/ctr Identifier : C000000412 .

84,"The RANK-RANK-Ligand (RANKL) pathway is involved in the development of Aire-expressing medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). [SEP] The thymic medulla provides a specialized microenvironment for the negative selection of T cells , with the presence of autoimmune regulator (Aire)-expressing medullary thymic epithelial cells ( mTECs ) during the embryonic-neonatal period being both necessary and sufficient to establish long-lasting tolerance . Here we showed that emergence of the first cohorts of Aire(+ ) mTECs at this key developmental stage , prior to αβ T cell repertoire selection , was jointly directed by Rankl(+ ) lymphoid tissue inducer cells and invariant Vγ5(+ ) dendritic epidermal T cell ( DETC ) progenitors that are the first thymocytes to express the products of gene rearrangement . In turn , generation of Aire(+ ) mTECs then fostered Skint-1-dependent , but Aire-independent , DETC progenitor maturation and the emergence of an invariant DETC repertoire . Hence , our data attributed a functional importance to the temporal development of Vγ5(+ ) γδ T cells during thymus medulla formation for αβ T cell tolerance induction and demonstrated a Rank-mediated reciprocal link between DETC and Aire(+ ) mTEC maturation . Medullary thymic epithelial cells ( mTECs ) establish T cell self-tolerance through the expression of autoimmune regulator ( Aire ) and peripheral tissue-specific self-antigens . However , signals underlying mTEC development remain largely unclear . Here , we demonstrate crucial regulation of mTEC development by receptor activator of NF-kappaB ( RANK ) and CD40 signals . Whereas only RANK signaling was essential for mTEC development during embryogenesis , in postnatal mice , cooperation between CD40 and RANK signals was required for mTEC development to successfully establish the medullary microenvironment . Ligation of RANK or CD40 on fetal thymic stroma in vitro induced mTEC development in a tumor necrosis factor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)- , NF-kappaB inducing kinase (NIK)- , and IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta)-dependent manner . These results show that developmental-stage-dependent cooperation between RANK and CD40 promotes mTEC development , thereby establishing self-tolerance . Aire-expressing medullary thymic epithelial cells ( mTECs ) play a key role in preventing autoimmunity by expressing tissue-restricted antigens to help purge the emerging T cell receptor repertoire of self-reactive specificities . Here we demonstrate a novel role for a CD4 + 3− inducer cell population , previously linked to development of organized secondary lymphoid structures and maintenance of T cell memory in the functional regulation of Aire-mediated promiscuous gene expression in the thymus . CD4 + 3− cells are closely associated with mTECs in adult thymus , and in fetal thymus their appearance is temporally linked with the appearance of Aire+ mTECs . We show that RANKL signals from this cell promote the maturation of RANK-expressing CD80−Aire− mTEC progenitors into CD80+Aire+ mTECs , and that transplantation of RANK-deficient thymic stroma into immunodeficient hosts induces autoimmunity . Collectively , our data reveal cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to the generation of Aire+ mTECs and highlight a previously unrecognized role for CD4 + 3−RANKL+ inducer cells in intrathymic self-tolerance . The thymic medulla provides a microenvironment where medullary thymic epithelial cells ( mTECs ) express autoimmune regulator and diverse tissue-restricted genes , contributing to launching self-tolerance . Positive selection is essential for thymic medulla formation via a previously unknown mechanism . Here we show that the cytokine RANK ligand ( RANKL ) was produced by positively selected thymocytes and regulated the cellularity of mTEC by interacting with RANK and osteoprotegerin .

85,"DUSP4 downregulation deactivates the Ras-ERK pathway [SEP] Neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC ) induces a pathological complete response ( pCR ) in ∼30 % of patients with breast cancer . However , many patients have residual cancer after chemotherapy , which correlates with a higher risk of metastatic recurrence and poorer outcome than those who achieve a pCR . We hypothesized that molecular profiling of tumors after NAC would identify genes associated with drug resistance . Digital transcript counting was used to profile surgically resected breast cancers after NAC . Low concentrations of dual specificity protein phosphatase 4 ( DUSP4 ) , an ERK phosphatase , correlated with high post-NAC tumor cell proliferation and with basal-like breast cancer ( BLBC ) status . BLBC had higher DUSP4 promoter methylation and gene expression patterns of Ras-ERK pathway activation relative to other breast cancer subtypes . DUSP4 overexpression increased chemotherapy-induced apoptosis , whereas DUSP4 depletion dampened the response to chemotherapy . Reduced DUSP4 expression in primary tumors after NAC was associated with treatment-refractory high Ki-67 scores and shorter recurrence-free survival . Finally , inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( MEK ) synergized with docetaxel treatment in BLBC xenografts . Thus , DUSP4 downregulation activates the Ras-ERK pathway in BLBC , resulting in an attenuated response to anti-cancer chemotherapy .

86,"Taking 400mg of α-tocopheryl acetate does not prevent prostate cancer. [SEP] CONTEXT Many individuals take vitamins in the hopes of preventing chronic diseases such as cancer , and vitamins E and C are among the most common individual supplements . A large-scale randomized trial suggested that vitamin E may reduce risk of prostate cancer ; however , few trials have been powered to address this relationship . No previous trial in men at usual risk has examined vitamin C alone in the prevention of cancer . OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether long-term vitamin E or C supplementation decreases risk of prostate and total cancer events among men . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS The Physicians ' Health Study II is a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled factorial trial of vitamins E and C that began in 1997 and continued until its scheduled completion on August 31 , 2007 . A total of 14,641 male physicians in the United States initially aged 50 years or older , including 1307 men with a history of prior cancer at randomization , were enrolled . INTERVENTION Individual supplements of 400 IU of vitamin E every other day and 500 mg of vitamin C daily . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Prostate and total cancer . RESULTS During a mean follow-up of 8.0 years , there were 1008 confirmed incident cases of prostate cancer and 1943 total cancers . Compared with placebo , vitamin E had no effect on the incidence of prostate cancer ( active and placebo vitamin E groups , 9.1 and 9.5 events per 1000 person-years ; hazard ratio [ HR ] , 0.97 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.85 - 1.09 ; P = .58 ) or total cancer ( active and placebo vitamin E groups , 17.8 and 17.3 cases per 1000 person-years ; HR , 1.04 ; 95 % CI , 0.95 - 1.13 ; P = .41 ) . There was also no significant effect of vitamin C on total cancer ( active and placebo vitamin C groups , 17.6 and 17.5 events per 1000 person-years ; HR , 1.01 ; 95 % CI , 0.92 - 1.10 ; P = .86 ) or prostate cancer ( active and placebo vitamin C groups , 9.4 and 9.2 cases per 1000 person-years ; HR , 1.02 ; 95 % CI , 0.90 - 1.15 ; P = .80 ) . Neither vitamin E nor vitamin C had a significant effect on colorectal , lung , or other site-specific cancers . Adjustment for adherence and exclusion of the first 4 or 6 years of follow-up did not alter the results . Stratification by various cancer risk factors demonstrated no significant modification of the effect of vitamin E on prostate cancer risk or either agent on total cancer risk . CONCLUSIONS In this large , long-term trial of male physicians , neither vitamin E nor C supplementation reduced the risk of prostate or total cancer . These data provide no support for the use of these supplements for the prevention of cancer in middle-aged and older men . TRIAL REGISTRATION clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT00270647 .

88,"The combination of physical examinations with C-reactive protein values do not improve the accuracy of radiographic verified pneumonia predictions. [SEP] OBJECTIVES To quantify the diagnostic accuracy of selected inflammatory markers in addition to symptoms and signs for predicting pneumonia and to derive a diagnostic tool . DESIGN Diagnostic study performed between 2007 and 2010 . Participants had their history taken , underwent physical examination and measurement of C reactive protein ( CRP ) and procalcitonin in venous blood on the day they first consulted , and underwent chest radiography within seven days . SETTING Primary care centres in 12 European countries . PARTICIPANTS Adults presenting with acute cough . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Pneumonia as determined by radiologists , who were blind to all other information when they judged chest radiographs . RESULTS Of 3106 eligible patients , 286 were excluded because of missing or inadequate chest radiographs , leaving 2820 patients ( mean age 50 , 40 % men ) of whom 140 ( 5 % ) had pneumonia . Re-assessment of a subset of 1675 chest radiographs showed agreement in 94 % ( κ 0.45 , 95 % confidence interval 0.36 to 0.54 ) . Six published "" symptoms and signs models "" varied in their discrimination ( area under receiver operating characteristics curve ( ROC ) ranged from 0.55 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.50 to 0.61 ) to 0.71 ( 0.66 to 0.76 ) ) . The optimal combination of clinical prediction items derived from our patients included absence of runny nose and presence of breathlessness , crackles and diminished breath sounds on auscultation , tachycardia , and fever , with an ROC area of 0.70 ( 0.65 to 0.75 ) . Addition of CRP at the optimal cut off of > 30 mg/L increased the ROC area to 0.77 ( 0.73 to 0.81 ) and improved the diagnostic classification ( net reclassification improvement 28 % ) . In the 1556 patients classified according to symptoms , signs , and CRP > 30 mg/L as "" low risk "" ( < 2.5 % ) for pneumonia , the prevalence of pneumonia was 2 % . In the 132 patients classified as "" high risk "" ( > 20 % ) , the prevalence of pneumonia was 31 % . The positive likelihood ratio of low , intermediate , and high risk for pneumonia was 0.4 , 1.2 , and 8.6 respectively . Measurement of procalcitonin added no relevant additional diagnostic information . A simplified diagnostic score based on symptoms , signs , and CRP > 30 mg/L resulted in proportions of pneumonia of 0.7 % , 3.8 % , and 18.2 % in the low , intermediate , and high risk group respectively . CONCLUSIONS A clinical rule based on symptoms and signs to predict pneumonia in patients presenting to primary care with acute cough performed best in patients with mild or severe clinical presentation . Addition of CRP concentration at the optimal cut off of > 30 mg/L improved diagnostic information , but measurement of procalcitonin concentration did not add clinically relevant information in this group .

Approximately 75 % of cells in a highly enriched long-term repopulating HSC ( LT-HSC ) pool ( Lin(-)Sca1(+)c-Kit(hi)CD150(+)CD48(- ) ) are quiescent , with only a small percentage of the LT-HSCs in cycle . Transcription factor GATA-3 is known to be vital for the development of T cells at multiple stages in the thymus and for Th2 differentiation in the peripheral organs . Although it is well documented that GATA-3 is expressed in HSCs , a role for GATA-3 in any prethymic progenitor cell has not been established . In the present study , we show that Gata3-null mutant mice generate fewer LT-HSCs and that fewer Gata3-null LT-HSCs are in cycle . Furthermore , Gata3 mutant hematopoietic progenitor cells fail to be recruited into an increased cycling state after 5-fluorouracil-induced myelosuppression . Therefore , GATA-3 is required for the maintenance of a normal number of LT-HSCs and for their entry into the cell cycle .

DESIGN Retrospective cohort study evaluating overall and cancer mortality in relation to immunosuppressive drug exposure among patients with ocular inflammatory diseases . Demographic , clinical , and treatment data derived from medical records , and mortality results from United States National Death Index linkage . The cohort 's mortality risk was compared with US vital statistics using standardised mortality ratios . Overall and cancer mortality in relation to use or non-use of immunosuppressive drugs within the cohort was studied with survival analysis . SETTING Five tertiary ocular inflammation clinics . Patients 7957 US residents with non-infectious ocular inflammation , 2340 of whom received immunosuppressive drugs during follow up . Exposures Use of antimetabolites , T cell inhibitors , alkylating agents , and tumour necrosis factor inhibitors . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Overall mortality , cancer mortality . RESULTS Over 66 802 person years ( 17 316 after exposure to immunosuppressive drugs ) , 936 patients died ( 1.4/100 person years ) , 230 ( 24.6 % ) from cancer . For patients unexposed to immunosuppressive treatment , risks of death overall ( standardised mortality ratio 1.02 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.94 to 1.11 ) and from cancer ( 1.10 , 0.93 to 1.29 ) were similar to those of the US population . Patients who used azathioprine , methotrexate , mycophenolate mofetil , ciclosporin , systemic corticosteroids , or dapsone had overall and cancer mortality similar to that of patients who never took immunosuppressive drugs . In patients who used cyclophosphamide , overall mortality was not increased and cancer mortality was non-significantly increased .

However , whether pharmacist participation in the ICU at the time of drug prescribing reduces adverse events has not been studied . OBJECTIVE To measure the effect of pharmacist participation on medical rounds in the ICU on the rate of preventable adverse drug events ( ADEs ) caused by ordering errors . DESIGN Before-after comparison between phase 1 ( baseline ) and phase 2 ( after intervention implemented ) and phase 2 comparison with a control unit that did not receive the intervention . SETTING A medical ICU ( study unit ) and a coronary care unit ( control unit ) in a large urban teaching hospital . PATIENTS Seventy-five patients randomly selected from each of 3 groups : all admissions to the study unit from February 1 , 1993 , through July 31 , 1993 ( baseline ) and all admissions to the study unit ( postintervention ) and control unit from October 1 , 1994 , through July 7 , 1995 . In addition , 50 patients were selected at random from the control unit during the baseline period . INTERVENTION A senior pharmacist made rounds with the ICU team and remained in the ICU for consultation in the morning , and was available on call throughout the day . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Preventable ADEs due to ordering ( prescribing ) errors and the number , type , and acceptance of interventions made by the pharmacist . Preventable ADEs were identified by review of medical records of the randomly selected patients during both preintervention and postintervention phases . Pharmacists recorded all recommendations , which were then analyzed by type and acceptance . RESULTS The rate of preventable ordering ADEs decreased by 66 % from 10.4 per 1000 patient-days ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 7 - 14 ) before the intervention to 3.5 ( 95 % CI , 1 - 5 ; P<.001 ) after the intervention . In the control unit , the rate was essentially unchanged during the same time periods : 10.9 ( 95 % CI , 6 - 16 ) and 12.4 ( 95 % CI , 8 - 17 ) per 1000 patient-days . The pharmacist made 366 recommendations related to drug ordering , of which 362 ( 99 % ) were accepted by physicians .

93,"Adult tissue-resident macrophages are seeded before birth. [SEP] Mononuclear phagocytes , including monocytes , macrophages , and dendritic cells , contribute to tissue integrity as well as to innate and adaptive immune defense . Emerging evidence for labor division indicates that manipulation of these cells could bear therapeutic potential . However , specific ontogenies of individual populations and the overall functional organization of this cellular network are not well defined . Here we report a fate-mapping study of the murine monocyte and macrophage compartment taking advantage of constitutive and conditional CX(3)CR1 promoter-driven Cre recombinase expression . We have demonstrated that major tissue-resident macrophage populations , including liver Kupffer cells and lung alveolar , splenic , and peritoneal macrophages , are established prior to birth and maintain themselves subsequently during adulthood independent of replenishment by blood monocytes . Furthermore , we have established that short-lived Ly6C(+ ) monocytes constitute obligatory steady-state precursors of blood-resident Ly6C(- ) cells and that the abundance of Ly6C(+ ) blood monocytes dynamically controls the circulation lifespan of their progeny . Macrophages are distributed in tissues throughout the body and contribute to both homeostasis and disease . Recently , it has become evident that most adult tissue macrophages originate during embryonic development and not from circulating monocytes . Each tissue has its own composition of embryonically derived and adult-derived macrophages , but it is unclear whether macrophages of distinct origins are functionally interchangeable or have unique roles at steady state . This new understanding also prompts reconsideration of the function of circulating monocytes . Classical Ly6c(hi ) monocytes patrol the extravascular space in resting organs , and Ly6c(lo ) nonclassical monocytes patrol the vasculature . Inflammation triggers monocytes to differentiate into macrophages , but whether resident and newly recruited macrophages possess similar functions during inflammation is unclear .

These properties are adaptive when together cells can face environmental challenges that they separately can not . One particular challenge that is important for microorganisms is migration . In this study , we show how flagellum-independent migration is driven by the division of labor of two cell types that appear during Bacillus subtilis sliding motility . Cell collectives organize themselves into bundles ( called "" van Gogh bundles "" ) of tightly aligned cell chains that form filamentous loops at the colony edge . We show , by time-course microscopy , that these loops migrate by pushing themselves away from the colony . The formation of van Gogh bundles depends critically on the synergistic interaction of surfactin-producing and matrix-producing cells . We propose that surfactin-producing cells reduce the friction between cells and their substrate , thereby facilitating matrix-producing cells to form bundles . The folding properties of these bundles determine the rate of colony expansion .

PARTICIPANTS The 3736 patients in the cohort who started HAART before 2002 ( median age 36 years , 29 % female , median follow up 3.6 years ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Time to AIDS or death ( primary endpoint ) , death alone , increases in CD4 cell count of at least 50 and 100 above baseline , optimal viral suppression ( a viral load below 400 copies/ml ) , and viral rebound . RESULTS During follow up 2985 ( 80 % ) participants reported a stable partnership on at least one occasion . When starting HAART , 52 % ( 545/1042 ) of participants reported a stable partnership ; after five years of follow up 46 % ( 190/412 ) of participants reported a stable partnership . In an analysis stratified by previous antiretroviral therapy and clinical stage when starting HAART ( US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention group A , B , or C ) , the adjusted hazard ratio for progression to AIDS or death was 0.79 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.63 to 0.98 ) for participants with a stable partnership compared with those without .

Recruitment status was extracted from the ClinicalTrials.gov database . A systematic search for studies published in peer reviewed journals was performed ; if they were not found , results posted on the ClinicalTrials.gov results database were sought . Email queries were sent to trial investigators of discontinued and unpublished completed trials if no reason for the respective status was disclosed . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Trial discontinuation before completion and non-publication after completion . Logistic regression was used to determine the effect of funding source on publication status , with adjustment for intervention type and trial size . RESULTS Of 818 registered trials found using the keyword "" surgery "" , 395 met the inclusion criteria . Of these , 21 % ( 81/395 ) were discontinued early , most commonly owing to poor recruitment ( 44 % , 36/81 ) . The remaining 314 ( 79 % ) trials proceeded to completion , with a publication rate of 66 % ( 208/314 ) at a median time of 4.9 ( interquartile range 4.0 - 6.0 ) years from study completion to publication search . A further 6 % ( 20/314 ) of studies presented results on ClinicalTrials.gov without a corresponding peer reviewed publication . Industry funding did not affect the rate of discontinuation ( adjusted odds ratio 0.91 , 95 % confidence interval 0.54 to 1.55 ) but was associated with a lower odds of publication for completed trials ( 0.43 , 0.26 to 0.72 ) .

98,"The US health care system can save up to $5 billion if 7% of patients waiting for kidney transplants participate in the optimized national kidney paired donation program. [SEP] CONTEXT Blood type and crossmatch incompatibility will exclude at least one third of patients in need from receiving a live donor kidney transplant . Kidney paired donation ( KPD ) offers incompatible donor/recipient pairs the opportunity to match for compatible transplants . Despite its increasing popularity , very few transplants have resulted from KPD . OBJECTIVE To determine the potential impact of improved matching schemes on the number and quality of transplants achievable with KPD . DESIGN , SETTING , AND POPULATION We developed a model that simulates pools of incompatible donor/recipient pairs . We designed a mathematically verifiable optimized matching algorithm and compared it with the scheme currently used in some centers and regions . Simulated patients from the general community with characteristics drawn from distributions describing end-stage renal disease patients eligible for renal transplantation and their willing and eligible live donors . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Number of kidneys matched , HLA mismatch of matched kidneys , and number of grafts surviving 5 years after transplantation . RESULTS A national optimized matching algorithm would result in more transplants ( 47.7 % vs 42.0 % , P<.001 ) , better HLA concordance ( 3.0 vs 4.5 mismatched antigens ; P<.001 ) , more grafts surviving at 5 years ( 34.9 % vs 28.7 % ; P<.001 ) , and a reduction in the number of pairs required to travel ( 2.9 % vs 18.4 % ; P<.001 ) when compared with an extension of the currently used first-accept scheme to a national level . Furthermore , highly sensitized patients would benefit 6-fold from a national optimized scheme ( 2.3 % vs 14.1 % successfully matched ; P<.001 ) . Even if only 7 % of patients awaiting kidney transplantation participated in an optimized national KPD program , the health care system could save as much as $ 750 million . CONCLUSIONS The combination of a national KPD program and a mathematically optimized matching algorithm yields more matches with lower HLA disparity . Optimized matching affords patients the flexibility of customizing their matching priorities and the security of knowing that the greatest number of high-quality matches will be found and distributed equitably .

[SEP] IMPORTANCE Use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) is associated with lower risk of colorectal cancer . OBJECTIVE To identify common genetic markers that may confer differential benefit from aspirin or NSAID chemoprevention , we tested gene × environment interactions between regular use of aspirin and/or NSAIDs and single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in relation to risk of colorectal cancer . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Case-control study using data from 5 case-control and 5 cohort studies initiated between 1976 and 2003 across the United States , Canada , Australia , and Germany and including colorectal cancer cases ( n=8634 ) and matched controls ( n=8553 ) ascertained between 1976 and 2011 . Participants were all of European descent . EXPOSURES Genome-wide SNP data and information on regular use of aspirin and/or NSAIDs and other risk factors . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Colorectal cancer . RESULTS Regular use of aspirin and/or NSAIDs was associated with lower risk of colorectal cancer ( prevalence , 28 % vs 38 % ; odds ratio [ OR ] , 0.69 [ 95 % CI , 0.64 - 0.74 ] ; P = 6.2 × 10(-28 ) ) compared with nonregular use . In the conventional logistic regression analysis , the SNP rs2965667 at chromosome 12p12.3 near the MGST1 gene showed a genome-wide significant interaction with aspirin and/or NSAID use ( P = 4.6 × 10(-9 ) for interaction ) . Aspirin and/or NSAID use was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer among individuals with rs2965667-TT genotype ( prevalence , 28 % vs 38 % ; OR , 0.66 [ 95 % CI , 0.61 - 0.70 ] ; P = 7.7 × 10(-33 ) ) but with a higher risk among those with rare ( 4 % ) TA or AA genotypes ( prevalence , 35 % vs 29 % ; OR , 1.89 [ 95 % CI , 1.27 - 2.81 ] ; P = .002 ) . In case-only interaction analysis , the SNP rs16973225 at chromosome 15q25.2 near the IL16 gene showed a genome-wide significant interaction with use of aspirin and/or NSAIDs ( P = 8.2 × 10(-9 ) for interaction ) . Regular use was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer among individuals with rs16973225-AA genotype ( prevalence , 28 % vs 38 % ; OR , 0.66 [ 95 % CI , 0.62 - 0.71 ] ; P = 1.9 × 10(-30 ) ) but was not associated with risk of colorectal cancer among those with less common ( 9 % ) AC or CC genotypes ( prevalence , 36 % vs 39 % ; OR , 0.97 [ 95 % CI , 0.78 - 1.20 ] ; P = .76 ) . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this genome-wide investigation of gene × environment interactions , use of aspirin and/or NSAIDs was associated with lower risk of colorectal cancer , and this association differed according to genetic variation at 2 SNPs at chromosomes 12 and 15 . Validation of these findings in additional populations may facilitate targeted colorectal cancer prevention strategies .
