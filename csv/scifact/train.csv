0,"OBJECTIVES To carry out a further survey of archived appendix samples to understand better the differences between existing estimates of the prevalence of subclinical infection with prions after the bovine spongiform encephalopathy epizootic and to see whether a broader birth cohort was affected , and to understand better the implications for the management of blood and blood products and for the handling of surgical instruments . DESIGN Irreversibly unlinked and anonymised large scale survey of archived appendix samples . SETTING Archived appendix samples from the pathology departments of 41 UK hospitals participating in the earlier survey , and additional hospitals in regions with lower levels of participation in that survey . SAMPLE 32,441 archived appendix samples fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin and tested for the presence of abnormal prion protein ( PrP ) . RESULTS Of the 32,441 appendix samples 16 were positive for abnormal PrP , indicating an overall prevalence of 493 per million population ( 95 % confidence interval 282 to 801 per million ) . The prevalence in those born in 1941 - 60 ( 733 per million , 269 to 1596 per million ) did not differ significantly from those born between 1961 and 1985 ( 412 per million , 198 to 758 per million ) and was similar in both sexes and across the three broad geographical areas sampled . Genetic testing of the positive specimens for the genotype at PRNP codon 129 revealed a high proportion that were valine homozygous compared with the frequency in the normal population , and in stark contrast with confirmed clinical cases of vCJD , all of which were methionine homozygous at PRNP codon 129 . CONCLUSIONS This study corroborates previous studies and suggests a high prevalence of infection with abnormal PrP , indicating vCJD carrier status in the population compared with the 177 vCJD cases to date . These findings have important implications for the management of blood and blood products and for the handling of surgical instruments .

1,"In systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , self-reactive antibodies can target the kidney ( lupus nephritis ) , leading to functional failure and possible mortality . We report that activation of basophils by autoreactive IgE causes their homing to lymph nodes , promoting T helper type 2 ( T(H)2 ) cell differentiation and enhancing the production of self-reactive antibodies that cause lupus-like nephritis in mice lacking the Src family protein tyrosine kinase Lyn ( Lyn(-/- ) mice ) . Individuals with SLE also have elevated serum IgE , self-reactive IgEs and activated basophils that express CD62 ligand ( CD62L ) and the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II molecule human leukocyte antigen-DR ( HLA-DR ) , parameters that are associated with increased disease activity and active lupus nephritis . Basophils were also present in the lymph nodes and spleen of subjects with SLE . Thus , in Lyn(-/- ) mice , basophils and IgE autoantibodies amplify autoantibody production that leads to lupus nephritis , and in individuals with SLE IgE autoantibodies and activated basophils are factors associated with disease activity and nephritis .

2,"BACKGROUND Adoption of new and underutilized vaccines by national immunization programs is an essential step towards reducing child mortality . Policy decisions to adopt new vaccines in high mortality countries often lag behind decisions in high-income countries . Using the case of Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) vaccine , this paper endeavors to explain these delays through the analysis of country-level economic , epidemiological , programmatic and policy-related factors , as well as the role of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation ( GAVI Alliance ) . METHODS AND FINDINGS Data for 147 countries from 1990 to 2007 were analyzed in accelerated failure time models to identify factors that are associated with the time to decision to adopt Hib vaccine . In multivariable models that control for Gross National Income , region , and burden of Hib disease , the receipt of GAVI support speeded the time to decision by a factor of 0.37 ( 95 % CI 0.18 - 0.76 ) , or 63 % . The presence of two or more neighboring country adopters accelerated decisions to adopt by a factor of 0.50 ( 95 % CI 0.33 - 0.75 ) . For each 1 % increase in vaccine price , decisions to adopt are delayed by a factor of 1.02 ( 95 % CI 1.00 - 1.04 ) . Global recommendations and local studies were not associated with time to decision . CONCLUSIONS This study substantiates previous findings related to vaccine price and presents new evidence to suggest that GAVI eligibility is associated with accelerated decisions to adopt Hib vaccine . The influence of neighboring country decisions was also highly significant , suggesting that approaches to support the adoption of new vaccines should consider supply- and demand-side factors .

3,"Importance Despite lack of evidence of their utility , biomarkers of ovarian reserve are being promoted as potential markers of reproductive potential . Objective To determine the associations between biomarkers of ovarian reserve and reproductive potential among women of late reproductive age . Design , Setting , and Participants Prospective time-to-pregnancy cohort study ( 2008 to date of last follow-up in March 2016 ) of women ( N = 981 ) aged 30 to 44 years without a history of infertility who had been trying to conceive for 3 months or less , recruited from the community in the Raleigh-Durham , North Carolina , area . Exposures Early-follicular-phase serum level of antimüllerian hormone ( AMH ) , follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , and inhibin B and urinary level of FSH . Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcomes were the cumulative probability of conception by 6 and 12 cycles of attempt and relative fecundability ( probability of conception in a given menstrual cycle ) .

Results A total of 750 women ( mean age , 33.3 [ SD , 3.2 ] years ; 77 % white ; 36 % overweight or obese ) provided a blood and urine sample and were included in the analysis . After adjusting for age , body mass index , race , current smoking status , and recent hormonal contraceptive use , women with low AMH values ( < 0.7 ng/mL [ n = 84 ] ) did not have a significantly different predicted probability of conceiving by 6 cycles of attempt ( 65 % ; 95 % CI , 50%-75 % ) compared with women ( n = 579 ) with normal values ( 62 % ; 95 % CI , 57%-66 % ) or by 12 cycles of attempt ( 84 % [ 95 % CI , 70%-91 % ] vs 75 % [ 95 % CI , 70%-79 % ] , respectively ) . Women with high serum FSH values ( > 10 mIU/mL [ n = 83 ] ) did not have a significantly different predicted probability of conceiving after 6 cycles of attempt ( 63 % ; 95 % CI , 50%-73 % ) compared with women ( n = 654 ) with normal values ( 62 % ; 95 % CI , 57%-66 % ) or after 12 cycles of attempt ( 82 % [ 95 % CI , 70%-89 % ] vs 75 % [ 95 % CI , 70%-78 % ] , respectively ) .

7,"Efforts to develop drugs for Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) have shown promise in animal studies , only to fail in human trials , suggesting a pressing need to study AD in human model systems . Using human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells that expressed apolipoprotein E4 ( ApoE4 ) , a variant of the APOE gene product and the major genetic risk factor for AD , we demonstrated that ApoE4-expressing neurons had higher levels of tau phosphorylation , unrelated to their increased production of amyloid-β ( Aβ ) peptides , and that they displayed GABAergic neuron degeneration . ApoE4 increased Aβ production in human , but not in mouse , neurons . Converting ApoE4 to ApoE3 by gene editing rescued these phenotypes , indicating the specific effects of ApoE4 . Neurons that lacked APOE behaved similarly to those expressing ApoE3 , and the introduction of ApoE4 expression recapitulated the pathological phenotypes , suggesting a gain of toxic effects from ApoE4 .

8,"BACKGROUND Many mathematical models have investigated the impact of expanding access to antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) on new HIV infections . Comparing results and conclusions across models is challenging because models have addressed slightly different questions and have reported different outcome metrics . This study compares the predictions of several mathematical models simulating the same ART intervention programmes to determine the extent to which models agree about the epidemiological impact of expanded ART . METHODS AND FINDINGS Twelve independent mathematical models evaluated a set of standardised ART intervention scenarios in South Africa and reported a common set of outputs . Intervention scenarios systematically varied the CD4 count threshold for treatment eligibility , access to treatment , and programme retention . For a scenario in which 80 % of HIV-infected individuals start treatment on average 1 y after their CD4 count drops below 350 cells/µl and 85 % remain on treatment after 3 y , the models projected that HIV incidence would be 35 % to 54 % lower 8 y after the introduction of ART , compared to a counterfactual scenario in which there is no ART . More variation existed in the estimated long-term ( 38 y ) reductions in incidence . The impact of optimistic interventions including immediate ART initiation varied widely across models , maintaining substantial uncertainty about the theoretical prospect for elimination of HIV from the population using ART alone over the next four decades . The number of person-years of ART per infection averted over 8 y ranged between 5.8 and 18.7 . Considering the actual scale-up of ART in South Africa , seven models estimated that current HIV incidence is 17 % to 32 % lower than it would have been in the absence of ART .

Mutations of ATM cause a spectrum of defects ranging from neurodegeneration to cancer predisposition . However , the mechanism by which DNA damage activates ATM is poorly understood . Here we show that Cdk5 ( cyclin-dependent kinase 5 ) , activated by DNA damage , directly phosphorylates ATM at Ser 794 in post-mitotic neurons . Phosphorylation at Ser 794 precedes , and is required for , ATM autophosphorylation at Ser 1981 , and activates ATM kinase activity .

Interruption of the Cdk5-ATM pathway attenuates DNA-damage-induced neuronal cell cycle re-entry and expression of the p53 targets PUMA and Bax , protecting neurons from death . Thus , activation of Cdk5 by DNA damage serves as a critical signal to initiate the ATM response and regulate ATM-dependent cellular processes .

11,"Improved sequencing technologies offer unprecedented opportunities for investigating the role of rare genetic variation in common disease . However , there are considerable challenges with respect to study design , data analysis and replication . Using pooled next-generation sequencing of 507 genes implicated in the repair of DNA in 1,150 samples , an analytical strategy focused on protein-truncating variants ( PTVs ) and a large-scale sequencing case – control replication experiment in 13,642 individuals , here we show that rare PTVs in the p53-inducible protein phosphatase PPM1D are associated with predisposition to breast cancer and ovarian cancer . PPM1D PTV mutations were present in 25 out of 7,781 cases versus 1 out of 5,861 controls ( P = 1.12 × 10−5 ) , including 18 mutations in 6,912 individuals with breast cancer ( P = 2.42 × 10−4 ) and 12 mutations in 1,121 individuals with ovarian cancer ( P = 3.10 × 10−9 ) . Notably , all of the identified PPM1D PTVs were mosaic in lymphocyte DNA and clustered within a 370-base-pair region in the final exon of the gene , carboxy-terminal to the phosphatase catalytic domain . Functional studies demonstrate that the mutations result in enhanced suppression of p53 in response to ionizing radiation exposure , suggesting that the mutant alleles encode hyperactive PPM1D isoforms . Thus , although the mutations cause premature protein truncation , they do not result in the simple loss-of-function effect typically associated with this class of variant , but instead probably have a gain-of-function effect . Our results have implications for the detection and management of breast and ovarian cancer risk . More generally , these data provide new insights into the role of rare and of mosaic genetic variants in common conditions , and the use of sequencing in their identification . Gliomas arising in the brainstem and thalamus are devastating tumors that are difficult to surgically resect . To determine the genetic and epigenetic landscape of these tumors , we performed exomic sequencing of 14 brainstem gliomas ( BSGs ) and 12 thalamic gliomas . We also performed targeted mutational analysis of an additional 24 such tumors and genome-wide methylation profiling of 45 gliomas . This study led to the discovery of tumor-specific mutations in PPM1D , encoding wild-type p53-induced protein phosphatase 1D ( WIP1 ) , in 37.5 % of the BSGs that harbored hallmark H3F3A mutations encoding p. Lys27Met substitutions . PPM1D mutations were mutually exclusive with TP53 mutations in BSG and attenuated p53 activation in vitro . PPM1D mutations were truncating alterations in exon 6 that enhanced the ability of PPM1D to suppress the activation of the DNA damage response checkpoint protein CHK2 . These results define PPM1D as a frequent target of somatic mutation and as a potential therapeutic target in brainstem gliomas .

15,"BACKGROUND Alirocumab , a monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 ( PCSK9 ) , lowers plasma low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol and apolipoprotein B100 ( apoB ) . Although studies in mice and cells have identified increased hepatic LDL receptors as the basis for LDL lowering by PCSK9 inhibitors , there have been no human studies characterizing the effects of PCSK9 inhibitors on lipoprotein metabolism . In particular , it is not known whether inhibition of PCSK9 has any effects on very low-density lipoprotein or intermediate-density lipoprotein ( IDL ) metabolism . Inhibition of PCSK9 also results in reductions of plasma lipoprotein ( a ) levels . The regulation of plasma Lp(a ) levels , including the role of LDL receptors in the clearance of Lp(a ) , is poorly defined , and no mechanistic studies of the Lp(a ) lowering by alirocumab in humans have been published to date . METHODS Eighteen ( 10 F , 8 mol/L ) participants completed a placebo-controlled , 2-period study . They received 2 doses of placebo , 2 weeks apart , followed by 5 doses of 150 mg of alirocumab , 2 weeks apart . At the end of each period , fractional clearance rates ( FCRs ) and production rates ( PRs ) of apoB and apo(a ) were determined . In 10 participants , postprandial triglycerides and apoB48 levels were measured . RESULTS Alirocumab reduced ultracentrifugally isolated LDL-C by 55.1 % , LDL-apoB by 56.3 % , and plasma Lp(a ) by 18.7 % . The fall in LDL-apoB was caused by an 80.4 % increase in LDL-apoB FCR and a 23.9 % reduction in LDL-apoB PR . The latter was due to a 46.1 % increase in IDL-apoB FCR coupled with a 27.2 % decrease in conversion of IDL to LDL . The FCR of apo(a ) tended to increase ( 24.6 % ) without any change in apo(a ) PR . Alirocumab had no effects on FCRs or PRs of very low-density lipoproteins-apoB and very low-density lipoproteins triglycerides or on postprandial plasma triglycerides or apoB48 concentrations . CONCLUSIONS Alirocumab decreased LDL-C and LDL-apoB by increasing IDL- and LDL-apoB FCRs and decreasing LDL-apoB PR . These results are consistent with increases in LDL receptors available to clear IDL and LDL from blood during PCSK9 inhibition . The increase in apo(a ) FCR during alirocumab treatment suggests that increased LDL receptors may also play a role in the reduction of plasma Lp(a ) .

17,"BACKGROUND The diagnosis of hypertension has traditionally been based on blood-pressure measurements in the clinic , but home and ambulatory measurements better correlate with cardiovascular outcome , and ambulatory monitoring is more accurate than both clinic and home monitoring in diagnosing hypertension . We aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of different diagnostic strategies for hypertension . METHODS We did a Markov model-based probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis . We used a hypothetical primary-care population aged 40 years or older with a screening blood-pressure measurement greater than 140/90 mm Hg and risk-factor prevalence equivalent to the general population . We compared three diagnostic strategies-further blood pressure measurement in the clinic , at home , and with an ambulatory monitor-in terms of lifetime costs , quality-adjusted life years , and cost-effectiveness . FINDINGS Ambulatory monitoring was the most cost-effective strategy for the diagnosis of hypertension for men and women of all ages . It was cost-saving for all groups ( from -£56 [ 95 % CI -105 to -10 ] in men aged 75 years to -£323 [ -389 to -222 ] in women aged 40 years ) and resulted in more quality-adjusted life years for men and women older than 50 years ( from 0·006 [ 0·000 to 0·015 ] for women aged 60 years to 0·022 [ 0·012 to 0·035 ] for men aged 70 years ) . This finding was robust when assessed with a wide range of deterministic sensitivity analyses around the base case , but was sensitive if home monitoring was judged to have equal test performance to ambulatory monitoring or if treatment was judged effective irrespective of whether an individual was hypertensive . INTERPRETATION Ambulatory monitoring as a diagnostic strategy for hypertension after an initial raised reading in the clinic would reduce misdiagnosis and save costs . Additional costs from ambulatory monitoring are counterbalanced by cost savings from better targeted treatment . Ambulatory monitoring is recommended for most patients before the start of antihypertensive drugs .

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Eligible studies examined diagnosis of hypertension in adults of all ages using home and/or clinic blood pressure measurement compared with those made using ambulatory monitoring that clearly defined thresholds to diagnose hypertension . RESULTS The 20 eligible studies used various thresholds for the diagnosis of hypertension , and only seven studies ( clinic ) and three studies ( home ) could be directly compared with ambulatory monitoring . Compared with ambulatory monitoring thresholds of 135/85 mm Hg , clinic measurements over 140/90 mm Hg had mean sensitivity and specificity of 74.6 % ( 95 % confidence interval 60.7 % to 84.8 % ) and 74.6 % ( 47.9 % to 90.4 % ) , respectively , whereas home measurements over 135/85 mm Hg had mean sensitivity and specificity of 85.7 % ( 78.0 % to 91.0 % ) and 62.4 % ( 48.0 % to 75.0 % ) . CONCLUSIONS Neither clinic nor home measurement had sufficient sensitivity or specificity to be recommended as a single diagnostic test . If ambulatory monitoring is taken as the reference standard , then treatment decisions based on clinic or home blood pressure alone might result in substantial overdiagnosis . Ambulatory monitoring before the start of lifelong drug treatment might lead to more appropriate targeting of treatment , particularly around the diagnostic threshold .

18,"All homeotherms use thermogenesis to maintain their core body temperature , ensuring that cellular functions and physiological processes can continue in cold environments . In the prevailing model of thermogenesis , when the hypothalamus senses cold temperatures it triggers sympathetic discharge , resulting in the release of noradrenaline in brown adipose tissue and white adipose tissue . Acting via the β(3)-adrenergic receptors , noradrenaline induces lipolysis in white adipocytes , whereas it stimulates the expression of thermogenic genes , such as PPAR-γ coactivator 1a ( Ppargc1a ) , uncoupling protein 1 ( Ucp1 ) and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 ( Acsl1 ) , in brown adipocytes . However , the precise nature of all the cell types involved in this efferent loop is not well established . Here we report in mice an unexpected requirement for the interleukin-4 (IL-4)-stimulated program of alternative macrophage activation in adaptive thermogenesis . Exposure to cold temperature rapidly promoted alternative activation of adipose tissue macrophages , which secrete catecholamines to induce thermogenic gene expression in brown adipose tissue and lipolysis in white adipose tissue . Absence of alternatively activated macrophages impaired metabolic adaptations to cold , whereas administration of IL-4 increased thermogenic gene expression , fatty acid mobilization and energy expenditure , all in a macrophage-dependent manner .

19,"Angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors are now one of the most frequently used classes of antihypertensive drugs . Beyond their utility in the management of hypertension , their use has been extended to the long-term management of patients with congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , as well as diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathies . Although ACE inhibitor therapy usually improves renal blood flow ( RBF ) and sodium excretion rates in CHF and reduces the rate of progressive renal injury in chronic renal disease , its use can also be associated with a syndrome of “ functional renal insufficiency ” and/or hyperkalemia . This form of acute renal failure ( ARF ) most commonly develops shortly after initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy but can be observed after months or years of therapy , even in the absence of prior ill effects . ARF is most likely to occur when renal perfusion pressure can not be sustained because of substantial decreases in mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) or when glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) is highly angiotensin II ( Ang II ) dependent . Conditions that predict an adverse hemodynamic effect of ACE inhibitors in patients with CHF are preexisting hypotension and low cardiac filling pressures . The GFR is especially dependent on Ang II during extracellular fluid ( ECF ) volume depletion , high-grade bilateral renal artery stenosis , or stenosis of a dominant or single kidney , as in a renal transplant recipient . Understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms and the common risk factors for ACE inhibitor – induced functional ARF is critical , because preventive strategies for ARF exist , and if effectively used , they may permit use of these compounds in a less restricted fashion . Under normal physiological conditions , renal autoregulation adjusts renal vascular resistance , so that RBF and GFR remain constant over a wide range of MAPs.1 The intrinsic renal autoregulation mechanism is adjusted by Ang II and the sympathetic nervous system .

OBJECTIVE To provide information about the nature and extent of indoor secondary aerosolization of B anthracis spores . DESIGN Stationary and personal air samples , surface dust , and swab samples were collected under semiquiescent ( minimal activities ) and then simulated active office conditions to estimate secondary aerosolization of B anthracis spores . Nominal size characteristics , airborne concentrations , and surface contamination of B anthracis particles ( colony-forming units ) were evaluated . RESULTS Viable B anthracis spores reaerosolized under semiquiescent conditions , with a marked increase in reaerosolization during simulated active office conditions . Increases were observed for B anthracis collected on open sheep blood agar plates ( P<.001 ) and personal air monitors ( P = .01 ) during active office conditions . More than 80 % of the B anthracis particles collected on stationary monitors were within an alveolar respirable size range of 0.95 to 3.5 micro m.

DATA SOURCES Medline , Embase , the Cochrane Trials Registry , and PsycLIT . Studies reviewed Randomised trials of adults receiving tricyclics as only treatment for a minimum of four weeks . DATA EXTRACTION Frequency of headaches ( number of headache attacks for migraine and number of days with headache for tension-type headaches ) , intensity of headache , and headache index . RESULTS 37 studies met the inclusion criteria . Tricyclics significantly reduced the number of days with tension-type headache and number of headache attacks from migraine than placebo ( average standardised mean difference -1.29 , 95 % confidence interval -2.18 to -0.39 and -0.70 , -0.93 to -0.48 ) but not compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( -0.80 , -2.63 to 0.02 and -0.20 , -0.60 to 0.19 ) . The effect of tricyclics increased with longer duration of treatment ( β=-0.11 , 95 % confidence interval -0.63 to -0.15 ; P<0.0005 ) . Tricyclics were also more likely to reduce the intensity of headaches by at least 50 % than either placebo ( tension-type : relative risk 1.41 , 95 % confidence interval 1.02 to 1.89 ; migraine : 1.80 , 1.24 to 2.62 ) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( 1.73 , 1.34 to 2.22 and 1.72 , 1.15 to 2.55 ) . Tricyclics were more likely to cause adverse effects than placebo ( 1.53 , 95 % confidence interval 1.11 to 2.12 ) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( 2.22 , 1.52 to 3.32 ) , including dry mouth ( P<0.0005 for both ) , drowsiness ( P<0.0005 for both ) , and weight gain ( P<0.001 for both ) , but did not increase dropout rates ( placebo : 1.22 , 0.83 to 1.80 , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors : 1.16 , 0.81 to 2.97 ) .

But it may not be that simple . The idea that reducing antibiotic use would redress the problem formed part of a positive response on the part of the United Kingdom government to the House of Lords report,1 including a public information campaign , surveillance of resistance along the food chain , targets with respect to hospital acquired infections , and setting up of an overarching advisory body on all aspects of antibiotic use .

23,"BACKGROUND Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection is the strongest risk factor for developing tuberculosis and has fuelled its resurgence , especially in sub-Saharan Africa . In 2010 , there were an estimated 1.1 million incident cases of tuberculosis among the 34 million people living with HIV worldwide . Antiretroviral therapy has substantial potential to prevent HIV-associated tuberculosis . We conducted a systematic review of studies that analysed the impact of antiretroviral therapy on the incidence of tuberculosis in adults with HIV infection . METHODS AND FINDINGS PubMed , Embase , African Index Medicus , LILACS , and clinical trial registries were systematically searched . Randomised controlled trials , prospective cohort studies , and retrospective cohort studies were included if they compared tuberculosis incidence by antiretroviral therapy status in HIV-infected adults for a median of over 6 mo in developing countries . For the meta-analyses there were four categories based on CD4 counts at antiretroviral therapy initiation : ( 1 ) less than 200 cells/µl , ( 2 ) 200 to 350 cells/µl , ( 3 ) greater than 350 cells/µl , and ( 4 ) any CD4 count . Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria . Antiretroviral therapy is strongly associated with a reduction in the incidence of tuberculosis in all baseline CD4 count categories : ( 1 ) less than 200 cells/µl ( hazard ratio [ HR ] 0.16 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.07 to 0.36 ) , ( 2 ) 200 to 350 cells/µl ( HR 0.34 , 95 % CI 0.19 to 0.60 ) , ( 3 ) greater than 350 cells/µl ( HR 0.43 , 95 % CI 0.30 to 0.63 ) , and ( 4 ) any CD4 count ( HR 0.35 , 95 % CI 0.28 to 0.44 ) . There was no evidence of hazard ratio modification with respect to baseline CD4 count category ( p = 0.20 ) . CONCLUSIONS Antiretroviral therapy is strongly associated with a reduction in the incidence of tuberculosis across all CD4 count strata . Earlier initiation of antiretroviral therapy may be a key component of global and national strategies to control the HIV-associated tuberculosis syndemic .

24,"OBJECTIVE To assess whether population screening for impaired vision among older people in the community leads to improvements in vision . DESIGN Systematic review of randomised controlled trials of population screening in the community that included any assessment of vision or visual function with at least 6 months ' follow up . SUBJECTS Adults aged 65 or over . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Proportions with visual impairment in intervention and control groups with any method of assessing visual impairment . RESULTS There were no trials that primarily assessed visual screening . Outcome data on vision were available for 3494 people in five trials of multiphasic assessment . All the trials used self reported measures for vision impairment , both as screening tools and as outcome measures . The inclusion of a visual screening component in the assessment did not result in improvements in self reported visual problems ( pooled odds ratio 1.04:95 % confidence interval 0.89 to 1.22 ) . A small reduction ( 11 % ) in the number of older people with self reported visual problems can not be excluded . CONCLUSIONS Screening of asymptomatic older people in the community is not justified on present evidence . Visual impairment in this age group can usually be reduced with treatment . It is unclear why no benefit was seen . Further work is needed to clarify what interventions are appropriate for older people with unreported impairment of vision .

25,"CONTEXT Antibody-based induction therapy plus calcineurin inhibitors ( CNIs ) reduce acute rejection rates in kidney recipients ; however , opportunistic infections and toxic CNI effects remain challenging . Reportedly , mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) have successfully treated graft-vs-host disease . OBJECTIVE To assess autologous MSCs as replacement of antibody induction for patients with end-stage renal disease who undergo ABO-compatible , cross-match-negative kidney transplants from a living-related donor . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PATIENTS One hundred fifty-nine patients were enrolled in this single-site , prospective , open-label , randomized study from February 2008-May 2009 , when recruitment was completed . INTERVENTION Patients were inoculated with marrow-derived autologous MSC ( 1 - 2 x 10(6)/kg ) at kidney reperfusion and two weeks later . Fifty-three patients received standard-dose and 52 patients received low-dose CNIs ( 80 % of standard ) ; 51 patients in the control group received anti-IL-2 receptor antibody plus standard-dose CNIs . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary measure was 1-year incidence of acute rejection and renal function ( estimated glomerular filtration rate [ eGFR ] ) ; the secondary measure was patient and graft survival and incidence of adverse events . RESULTS Patient and graft survival at 13 to 30 months was similar in all groups . After 6 months , 4 of 53 patients ( 7.5 % ) in the autologous MSC plus standard-dose CNI group ( 95 % CI , 0.4%-14.7 % ; P = .04 ) and 4 of 52 patients ( 7.7 % ) in the low-dose group ( 95 % CI , 0.5%-14.9 % ; P = .046 ) compared with 11 of 51 controls ( 21.6 % ; 95 % CI , 10.5%-32.6 % ) had biopsy-confirmed acute rejection . None of the patients in either autologous MSC group had glucorticoid-resistant rejection , whereas 4 patients ( 7.8 % ) in the control group did ( 95 % CI , 0.6%-15.1 % ; overall P = .02 ) . Renal function recovered faster among both MSC groups showing increased eGFR levels during the first month after surgery than the control group . Patients receiving standard-dose CNI had a mean difference of 6.2 mL/min per 1.73 m(2 ) ( 95 % CI , 0.4 - 11.9 ; P=.04 ) and those in the low-dose CNI of 10.0 mL/min per 1.73 m(2 ) ( 95 % CI , 3.8 - 16.2 ; P=.002 ) . Also , during the 1-year follow-up , combined analysis of MSC-treated groups revealed significantly decreased risk of opportunistic infections than the control group ( hazard ratio , 0.42 ; 95 % CI , 0.20 - 0.85 , P=.02 ) CONCLUSION Among patients undergoing renal transplant , the use of autologous MSCs compared with anti-IL-2 receptor antibody induction therapy resulted in lower incidence of acute rejection , decreased risk of opportunistic infection , and better estimated renal function at 1 year .

26,"Despite growing interest and a recent surge in papers , the role of autophagy in glucose and lipid metabolism is unclear . We produced mice with skeletal muscle – specific deletion of Atg7 ( encoding autophagy-related 7 ) . Unexpectedly , these mice showed decreased fat mass and were protected from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance ; this phenotype was accompanied by increased fatty acid oxidation and browning of white adipose tissue ( WAT ) owing to induction of fibroblast growth factor 21 ( Fgf21 ) . Mitochondrial dysfunction induced by autophagy deficiency increased Fgf21 expression through induction of Atf4 , a master regulator of the integrated stress response . Mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors also induced Fgf21 in an Atf4-dependent manner . We also observed induction of Fgf21 , resistance to diet-induced obesity and amelioration of insulin resistance in mice with autophagy deficiency in the liver , another insulin target tissue . These findings suggest that autophagy deficiency and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction promote Fgf21 expression , a hormone we consequently term a ' mitokine ' , and together these processes promote protection from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance .

27,"Resistance to apoptosis , often achieved by the overexpression of antiapoptotic proteins , is common and perhaps required in the genesis of cancer .

Eliminating BCL-2 yielded rapid loss of leukemic cells and significantly prolonged survival , formally validating BCL-2 as a rational target for cancer therapy . Loss of this single molecule resulted in cell death , despite or perhaps attributable to the presence of other oncogenic events .

28,"BACKGROUND Bariatric surgery is becoming a more widespread treatment for obesity . Comprehensive evidence of the long-term effects of contemporary surgery on a broad range of clinical outcomes in large populations treated in routine clinical practice is lacking . The objective of this study was to measure the association between bariatric surgery , weight , body mass index , and obesity-related co-morbidities . METHODS AND FINDINGS This was an observational retrospective cohort study using data from the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink . All 3,882 patients registered in the database and with bariatric surgery on or before 31 December 2014 were included and matched by propensity score to 3,882 obese patients without surgery . The main outcome measures were change in weight and body mass index over 4 y ; incident diagnoses of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , hypertension , angina , myocardial infarction ( MI ) , stroke , fractures , obstructive sleep apnoea , and cancer ; mortality ; and resolution of hypertension and T2DM . Weight measures were available for 3,847 patients between 1 and 4 mo , 2,884 patients between 5 and 12 mo , and 2,258 patients between 13 and 48 mo post-procedure . Bariatric surgery patients exhibited rapid weight loss for the first four postoperative months , at a rate of 4.98 kg/mo ( 95 % CI 4.88 - 5.08 ) . Slower weight loss was sustained to the end of 4 y. Gastric bypass ( 6.56 kg/mo ) and sleeve gastrectomy ( 6.29 kg/mo ) were associated with greater initial weight reduction than gastric banding ( 2.77 kg/mo ) . Protective hazard ratios ( HRs ) were detected for bariatric surgery for incident T2DM , 0.68 ( 95 % CI 0.55 - 0.83 ) ; hypertension , 0.35 ( 95 % CI 0.27 - 0.45 ) ; angina , 0.59 ( 95 % CI 0.40 - 0.87);MI , 0.28 ( 95 % CI 0.10 - 0.74 ) ; and obstructive sleep apnoea , 0.55 ( 95 % CI 0.40 - 0.87 ) . Strong associations were found between bariatric surgery and the resolution of T2DM , with a HR of 9.29 ( 95 % CI 6.84 - 12.62 ) , and between bariatric surgery and the resolution of hypertension , with a HR of 5.64 ( 95 % CI 2.65 - 11.99 ) . No association was detected between bariatric surgery and fractures , cancer , or stroke . Effect estimates for mortality found no protective association with bariatric surgery overall , with a HR of 0.97 ( 95 % CI 0.66 - 1.43 ) . The data used were recorded for the management of patients in primary care and may be subject to inaccuracy , which would tend to lead to underestimates of true relative effect sizes . CONCLUSIONS Bariatric surgery as delivered in the UK healthcare system is associated with dramatic weight loss , sustained at least 4 y after surgery .

METHODS AND FINDINGS This was an observational retrospective cohort study using data from the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink . All 3,882 patients registered in the database and with bariatric surgery on or before 31 December 2014 were included and matched by propensity score to 3,882 obese patients without surgery . The main outcome measures were change in weight and body mass index over 4 y ; incident diagnoses of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , hypertension , angina , myocardial infarction ( MI ) , stroke , fractures , obstructive sleep apnoea , and cancer ; mortality ; and resolution of hypertension and T2DM . Weight measures were available for 3,847 patients between 1 and 4 mo , 2,884 patients between 5 and 12 mo , and 2,258 patients between 13 and 48 mo post-procedure . Bariatric surgery patients exhibited rapid weight loss for the first four postoperative months , at a rate of 4.98 kg/mo ( 95 % CI 4.88 - 5.08 ) . Slower weight loss was sustained to the end of 4 y. Gastric bypass ( 6.56 kg/mo ) and sleeve gastrectomy ( 6.29 kg/mo ) were associated with greater initial weight reduction than gastric banding ( 2.77 kg/mo ) .

This weight loss is accompanied by substantial improvements in pre-existing T2DM and hypertension , as well as a reduced risk of incident T2DM , hypertension , angina , MI , and obstructive sleep apnoea . Widening the availability of bariatric surgery could lead to substantial health benefits for many people who are morbidly obese .

Here we examined the effects of oral supplementation of the bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid ( CDCA ) on human BAT activity . Treatment of 12 healthy female subjects with CDCA for 2 days resulted in increased BAT activity . Whole-body energy expenditure was also increased upon CDCA treatment .

44,"The early events leading to the development of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) remain unclear , but formation of autoantibodies to citrullinated protein antigens ( ACPAs ) is considered a key pathogenic event . Neutrophils isolated from patients with various autoimmune diseases display enhanced neutrophil extracellular trap ( NET ) formation , a phenomenon that exposes autoantigens in the context of immunostimulatory molecules . We investigated whether aberrant NETosis occurs in RA , determined its triggers , and examined its deleterious inflammatory consequences . Enhanced NETosis was observed in circulating and RA synovial fluid neutrophils compared to neutrophils from healthy controls and from patients with osteoarthritis ( OA ) . Further , netting neutrophils infiltrated RA synovial tissue , rheumatoid nodules , and skin . NETosis correlated with ACPA presence and levels and with systemic inflammatory markers . RA sera and immunoglobulin fractions from RA patients with high levels of ACPA and/or rheumatoid factor significantly enhanced NETosis , and the NETs induced by these autoantibodies displayed distinct protein content . Indeed , during NETosis , neutrophils externalized the citrullinated autoantigens implicated in RA pathogenesis , and anti-citrullinated vimentin antibodies potently induced NET formation . Moreover , the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-17A ( IL-17A ) and tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) induced NETosis in RA neutrophils . In turn , NETs significantly augmented inflammatory responses in RA and OA synovial fibroblasts , including induction of IL-6 , IL-8 , chemokines , and adhesion molecules . These observations implicate accelerated NETosis in RA pathogenesis , through externalization of citrullinated autoantigens and immunostimulatory molecules that may promote aberrant adaptive and innate immune responses in the joint and in the periphery , and perpetuate pathogenic mechanisms in this disease . BACKGROUND Histone deimination regulates gene function and contributes to antimicrobial response , allowing the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps ( NETs ) . Deiminated proteins are target of anti-citrullinated peptides antibodies ( ACPA ) in rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . OBJECTIVE The objective of this paper is to test the hypothesis that RA sera react with deiminated histones contained in NETs . METHODS Neutrophils from peripheral blood were stimulated with A23187 and acid treated ; NETosis was induced by phorbol myristate acetate , and NET proteins were isolated . Sera were tested by immunoblot on acid extracted proteins from neutrophils and from NETs , and by ELISA on deiminated histone H4 or H4-derived peptides . Bands reactive with RA sera were excised from gels , digested with trypsin and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time of flight ( MALDI-TOF ) analysis , before and after derivatisation to detect citrullinated peptides . RESULTS RA sera reacted with a deiminated antigen of 11 KDa from activated neutrophils , recognised also by anti-H4 and antideiminated H4 antibodies . A similar reactivity was observed with NET proteins . The antigen from neutrophils or NETs was identified as citrullinated H4 by MALDI-TOF analysis . By ELISA , RA sera bound in vitro citrullinated H4 . Citrullinated H4 14 - 34 and 31 - 50 peptides detected antibodies in 67 % and 63 % of RA sera and in less than 5 % of controls ; antibody titre was correlated with anti-CCP2 . CONCLUSIONS Citrullinated H4 from activated neutrophils and NETs is a target of antibodies in RA , and synthetic citrullinated H4-derived peptides are a new substrate for ACPA detection . As NETosis can generate antigens for ACPA , these data suggest a novel connection between innate and adaptive immunity in RA .

46,"IMPORTANCE Combining pharmacotherapies for tobacco-dependence treatment may increase smoking abstinence . OBJECTIVE To determine efficacy and safety of varenicline and bupropion sustained-release ( SR ; combination therapy ) compared with varenicline ( monotherapy ) in cigarette smokers . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized , blinded , placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial with a 12-week treatment period and follow-up through week 52 conducted between October 2009 and April 2013 at 3 midwestern clinical research sites . Five hundred six adult ( ≥18 years ) cigarette smokers were randomly assigned and 315 ( 62 % ) completed the study . INTERVENTIONS Twelve weeks of varenicline and bupropion SR or varenicline and placebo . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was abstinence rates at week 12 , defined as prolonged ( no smoking from 2 weeks after the target quit date ) abstinence and 7-day point-prevalence ( no smoking past 7 days ) abstinence . Secondary outcomes were prolonged and point-prevalence smoking abstinence rates at weeks 26 and 52 . Outcomes were biochemically confirmed . RESULTS At 12 weeks , 53.0 % of the combination therapy group achieved prolonged smoking abstinence and 56.2 % achieved 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence compared with 43.2 % and 48.6 % in varenicline monotherapy ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 1.49 ; 95 % CI , 1.05 - 2.12 ; P = .03 and OR , 1.36 ; 95 % CI , 0.95 - 1.93 ; P = .09 , respectively ) . At 26 weeks , 36.6 % of the combination therapy group achieved prolonged and 38.2 % achieved 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence compared with 27.6 % and 31.9 % in varenicline monotherapy ( OR , 1.52 ; 95 % CI , 1.04 - 2.22 ; P = .03 and OR , 1.32 ; 95 % CI , 0.91 - 1.91 ; P = .14 , respectively ) . At 52 weeks , 30.9 % of the combination therapy group achieved prolonged and 36.6 % achieved 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence compared with 24.5 % and 29.2 % in varenicline monotherapy ( OR , 1.39 ; 95 % CI , 0.93 - 2.07 ; P = .11 and OR , 1.40 ; 95 % CI , 0.96 - 2.05 ; P = .08 , respectively ) . Participants receiving combination therapy reported more anxiety ( 7.2 % vs 3.1 % ; P = .04 ) and depressive symptoms ( 3.6 % vs 0.8 % ; P = .03 ) . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among cigarette smokers , combined use of varenicline and bupropion , compared with varenicline alone , increased prolonged abstinence but not 7-day point prevalence at 12 and 26 weeks .

SETTING Health professionals in the United States . PARTICIPANTS 66,105 women from the Nurses ' Health Study ( 1984 - 2008 ) , 85,104 women from the Nurses ' Health Study II ( 1991 - 2009 ) , and 36,173 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study ( 1986 - 2008 ) who were free of major chronic diseases at baseline in these studies . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Incident cases of type 2 diabetes , identified through self report and confirmed by supplementary questionnaires . RESULTS During 3,464,641 person years of follow-up , 12,198 participants developed type 2 diabetes . After adjustment for personal , lifestyle , and dietary risk factors of diabetes , the pooled hazard ratio of type 2 diabetes for every three servings/week of total whole fruit consumption was 0.98 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.97 [ corrected ] to 0.99 ) . With mutual adjustment of individual fruits , the pooled hazard ratios of type 2 diabetes for every three servings/week were 0.74 ( 0.66 to 0.83 ) for blueberries , 0.88 ( 0.83 to 0.93 ) for grapes and raisins , 0.89 ( 0.79 to 1.01 ) for prunes , 0.93 ( 0.90 to 0.96 ) for apples and pears , 0.95 ( 0.91 to 0.98 ) for bananas , 0.95 ( 0.91 to 0.99 ) for grapefruit , 0.97 ( 0.92 to 1.02 ) for peaches , plums , and apricots , 0.99 ( 0.95 to 1.03 ) for oranges , 1.03 ( 0.96 to 1.10 ) for strawberries , and 1.10 ( 1.02 to 1.18 ) for cantaloupe . The pooled hazard ratio for the same increment in fruit juice consumption was 1.08 ( 1.05 to 1.11 ) . The associations with risk of type 2 diabetes differed significantly among individual fruits ( P<0.001 in all cohorts ) . CONCLUSION Our findings suggest the presence of heterogeneity in the associations between individual fruit consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes . Greater consumption of specific whole fruits , particularly blueberries , grapes , and apples , is significantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes , whereas greater consumption of fruit juice is associated with a higher risk .

52,"BACKGROUND Data on absolute risks of outcomes and patterns of drug use in cost-effectiveness analyses are often based on randomised clinical trials ( RCTs ) . The objective of this study was to evaluate the external validity of published cost-effectiveness studies by comparing the data used in these studies ( typically based on RCTs ) to observational data from actual clinical practice . Selective Cox-2 inhibitors ( coxibs ) were used as an example . METHODS AND FINDINGS The UK General Practice Research Database ( GPRD ) was used to estimate the exposure characteristics and individual probabilities of upper gastrointestinal ( GI ) events during current exposure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) or coxibs . A basic cost-effectiveness model was developed evaluating two alternative strategies : prescription of a conventional NSAID or coxib . Outcomes included upper GI events as recorded in GPRD and hospitalisation for upper GI events recorded in the national registry of hospitalisations ( Hospital Episode Statistics ) linked to GPRD . Prescription costs were based on the prescribed number of tables as recorded in GPRD and the 2006 cost data from the British National Formulary . The study population included over 1 million patients prescribed conventional NSAIDs or coxibs . Only a minority of patients used the drugs long-term and daily ( 34.5 % of conventional NSAIDs and 44.2 % of coxibs ) , whereas coxib RCTs required daily use for at least 6 - 9 months . The mean cost of preventing one upper GI event as recorded in GPRD was US$ 104k ( ranging from US$ 64k with long-term daily use to US$ 182k with intermittent use ) and US$ 298k for hospitalizations . The mean costs ( for GPRD events ) over calendar time were US$ 58k during 1990 - 1993 and US$ 174k during 2002 - 2005 . Using RCT data rather than GPRD data for event probabilities , the mean cost was US$ 16k with the VIGOR RCT and US$ 20k with the CLASS RCT .

53,"The most conspicuous event in the cell cycle is the alignment of chromosomes in metaphase . Chromosome alignment fosters faithful segregation through the formation of bi-oriented attachments of kinetochores to spindle microtubules . Notably , numerous kinetochore-microtubule ( k-MT ) attachment errors are present in early mitosis ( prometaphase ) , and the persistence of those errors is the leading cause of chromosome mis-segregation in aneuploid human tumour cells that continually mis-segregate whole chromosomes and display chromosomal instability . How robust error correction is achieved in prometaphase to ensure error-free mitosis remains unknown . Here we show that k-MT attachments in prometaphase cells are considerably less stable than in metaphase cells . The switch to more stable k-MT attachments in metaphase requires the proteasome-dependent destruction of cyclin A in prometaphase . Persistent cyclin A expression prevents k-MT stabilization even in cells with aligned chromosomes . By contrast , k-MTs are prematurely stabilized in cyclin-A-deficient cells . Consequently , cells lacking cyclin A display higher rates of chromosome mis-segregation . Thus , the stability of k-MT attachments increases decisively in a coordinated fashion among all chromosomes as cells transit from prometaphase to metaphase . Cyclin A creates a cellular environment that promotes microtubule detachment from kinetochores in prometaphase to ensure efficient error correction and faithful chromosome segregation .

58,"BACKGROUND The associations of blood pressure with the different manifestations of incident cardiovascular disease in a contemporary population have not been compared . In this study , we aimed to analyse the associations of blood pressure with 12 different presentations of cardiovascular disease . METHODS We used linked electronic health records from 1997 to 2010 in the CALIBER ( CArdiovascular research using LInked Bespoke studies and Electronic health Records ) programme to assemble a cohort of 1·25 million patients , 30 years of age or older and initially free from cardiovascular disease , a fifth of whom received blood pressure-lowering treatments . We studied the heterogeneity in the age-specific associations of clinically measured blood pressure with 12 acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases , and estimated the lifetime risks ( up to 95 years of age ) and cardiovascular disease-free life-years lost adjusted for other risk factors at index ages 30 , 60 , and 80 years . This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01164371 . FINDINGS During 5·2 years median follow-up , we recorded 83,098 initial cardiovascular disease presentations . In each age group , the lowest risk for cardiovascular disease was in people with systolic blood pressure of 90 - 114 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of 60 - 74 mm Hg , with no evidence of a J-shaped increased risk at lower blood pressures . The effect of high blood pressure varied by cardiovascular disease endpoint , from strongly positive to no effect . Associations with high systolic blood pressure were strongest for intracerebral haemorrhage ( hazard ratio 1·44 [ 95 % CI 1·32 - 1·58 ] ) , subarachnoid haemorrhage ( 1·43 [ 1·25 - 1·63 ] ) , and stable angina ( 1·41 [ 1·36 - 1·46 ] ) , and weakest for abdominal aortic aneurysm ( 1·08 [ 1·00 - 1·17 ] ) . Compared with diastolic blood pressure , raised systolic blood pressure had a greater effect on angina , myocardial infarction , and peripheral arterial disease , whereas raised diastolic blood pressure had a greater effect on abdominal aortic aneurysm than did raised systolic pressure . Pulse pressure associations were inverse for abdominal aortic aneurysm ( HR per 10 mm Hg 0·91 [ 95 % CI 0·86 - 0·98 ] ) and strongest for peripheral arterial disease ( 1·23 [ 1·20 - 1·27 ] ) . People with hypertension ( blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg or those receiving blood pressure-lowering drugs ) had a lifetime risk of overall cardiovascular disease at 30 years of age of 63·3 % ( 95 % CI 62·9 - 63·8 ) compared with 46·1 % ( 45·5 - 46·8 ) for those with normal blood pressure , and developed cardiovascular disease 5·0 years earlier ( 95 % CI 4·8 - 5·2 ) . Stable and unstable angina accounted for most ( 43 % ) of the cardiovascular disease-free years of life lost associated with hypertension from index age 30 years , whereas heart failure and stable angina accounted for the largest proportion ( 19 % each ) of years of life lost from index age 80 years . INTERPRETATION The widely held assumptions that blood pressure has strong associations with the occurrence of all cardiovascular diseases across a wide age range , and that diastolic and systolic associations are concordant , are not supported by the findings of this high-resolution study . Despite modern treatments , the lifetime burden of hypertension is substantial . These findings emphasise the need for new blood pressure-lowering strategies , and will help to inform the design of randomised trials to assess them .

63,"BACKGROUND Endometrial cancer incidence is continuing to rise in the wake of the current ageing and obesity epidemics . Much of the risk for endometrial cancer development is influenced by the environment and lifestyle . Accumulating evidence suggests that the epigenome serves as the interface between the genome and the environment and that hypermethylation of stem cell polycomb group target genes is an epigenetic hallmark of cancer . The objective of this study was to determine the functional role of epigenetic factors in endometrial cancer development . METHODS AND FINDINGS Epigenome-wide methylation analysis of > 27,000 CpG sites in endometrial cancer tissue samples ( n = 64 ) and control samples ( n = 23 ) revealed that HAND2 ( a gene encoding a transcription factor expressed in the endometrial stroma ) is one of the most commonly hypermethylated and silenced genes in endometrial cancer . A novel integrative epigenome-transcriptome-interactome analysis further revealed that HAND2 is the hub of the most highly ranked differential methylation hotspot in endometrial cancer . These findings were validated using candidate gene methylation analysis in multiple clinical sample sets of tissue samples from a total of 272 additional women . Increased HAND2 methylation was a feature of premalignant endometrial lesions and was seen to parallel a decrease in RNA and protein levels . Furthermore , women with high endometrial HAND2 methylation in their premalignant lesions were less likely to respond to progesterone treatment . HAND2 methylation analysis of endometrial secretions collected using high vaginal swabs taken from women with postmenopausal bleeding specifically identified those patients with early stage endometrial cancer with both high sensitivity and high specificity ( receiver operating characteristics area under the curve = 0.91 for stage 1A and 0.97 for higher than stage 1A ) . Finally , mice harbouring a Hand2 knock-out specifically in their endometrium were shown to develop precancerous endometrial lesions with increasing age , and these lesions also demonstrated a lack of PTEN expression . CONCLUSIONS HAND2 methylation is a common and crucial molecular alteration in endometrial cancer that could potentially be employed as a biomarker for early detection of endometrial cancer and as a predictor of treatment response . The true clinical utility of HAND2 DNA methylation , however , requires further validation in prospective studies . Please see later in the article for the Editors ' Summary .

64,"BACKGROUND Although unstable coronary artery disease is the most common reason for admission to a coronary care unit , the long-term prognosis of patients with this diagnosis is unknown . This is particularly true for patients with diabetes mellitus , who are known to have a high morbidity and mortality after an acute myocardial infarction . METHODS AND RESULTS Prospectively collected data from 6 different countries in the Organization to Assess Strategies for Ischemic Syndromes ( OASIS ) registry were analyzed to determine the 2-year prognosis of diabetic and nondiabetic patients who were hospitalized with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction . Overall , 1718 of 8013 registry patients ( 21 % ) had diabetes . Diabetic patients had a higher rate of coronary bypass surgery than nondiabetic patients ( 23 % versus 20 % , P:<0.001 ) but had similar rates of catheterization and angioplasty . Diabetes independently predicted mortality ( relative risk [ RR ] , 1.57 ; 95 % CI , 1.38 to 1.81 ; P:<0.001 ) , as well as cardiovascular death , new myocardial infarction , stroke , and new congestive heart failure . Moreover , compared with their nondiabetic counterparts , women had a significantly higher risk than men ( RR , 1.98 ; 95 % CI , 1.60 to 2.44 ; and RR , 1.28 ; 95 % CI , 1.06 to 1.56 , respectively ) . Interestingly , diabetic patients without prior cardiovascular disease had the same event rates for all outcomes as nondiabetic patients with previous vascular disease . CONCLUSIONS Hospitalization for unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction predicts a high 2-year morbidity and mortality ; this is especially evident for patients with diabetes . Diabetic patients with no previous cardiovascular disease have the same long-term morbidity and mortality as nondiabetic patients with established cardiovascular disease after hospitalization for unstable coronary artery disease .

65,"The Drosophila lymph gland is a haematopoietic organ in which progenitor cells , which are most akin to the common myeloid progenitor in mammals , proliferate and differentiate into three types of mature cell -- plasmatocytes , crystal cells and lamellocytes -- the functions of which are reminiscent of mammalian myeloid cells . During the first and early second instars of larval development , the lymph gland contains only progenitors , whereas in the third instar , a medial region of the primary lobe of the lymph gland called the medullary zone contains these progenitors , and maturing blood cells are found juxtaposed in a peripheral region designated the cortical zone . A third group of cells referred to as the posterior signalling centre functions as a haematopoietic niche . Similarly to mammalian myeloid cells , Drosophila blood cells respond to multiple stresses including hypoxia , infection and oxidative stress . However , how systemic signals are sensed by myeloid progenitors to regulate cell-fate determination has not been well described . Here , we show that the haematopoietic progenitors of Drosophila are direct targets of systemic ( insulin ) and nutritional ( essential amino acid ) signals , and that these systemic signals maintain the progenitors by promoting Wingless ( WNT in mammals ) signalling . We expect that this study will promote investigation of such possible direct signal sensing mechanisms by mammalian myeloid progenitors .

66,"Importance Despite lack of evidence of their utility , biomarkers of ovarian reserve are being promoted as potential markers of reproductive potential . Objective To determine the associations between biomarkers of ovarian reserve and reproductive potential among women of late reproductive age . Design , Setting , and Participants Prospective time-to-pregnancy cohort study ( 2008 to date of last follow-up in March 2016 ) of women ( N = 981 ) aged 30 to 44 years without a history of infertility who had been trying to conceive for 3 months or less , recruited from the community in the Raleigh-Durham , North Carolina , area . Exposures Early-follicular-phase serum level of antimüllerian hormone ( AMH ) , follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , and inhibin B and urinary level of FSH . Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcomes were the cumulative probability of conception by 6 and 12 cycles of attempt and relative fecundability ( probability of conception in a given menstrual cycle ) . Conception was defined as a positive pregnancy test result . Results A total of 750 women ( mean age , 33.3 [ SD , 3.2 ] years ; 77 % white ; 36 % overweight or obese ) provided a blood and urine sample and were included in the analysis . After adjusting for age , body mass index , race , current smoking status , and recent hormonal contraceptive use , women with low AMH values ( < 0.7 ng/mL [ n = 84 ] ) did not have a significantly different predicted probability of conceiving by 6 cycles of attempt ( 65 % ; 95 % CI , 50%-75 % ) compared with women ( n = 579 ) with normal values ( 62 % ; 95 % CI , 57%-66 % ) or by 12 cycles of attempt ( 84 % [ 95 % CI , 70%-91 % ] vs 75 % [ 95 % CI , 70%-79 % ] , respectively ) . Women with high serum FSH values ( > 10 mIU/mL [ n = 83 ] ) did not have a significantly different predicted probability of conceiving after 6 cycles of attempt ( 63 % ; 95 % CI , 50%-73 % ) compared with women ( n = 654 ) with normal values ( 62 % ; 95 % CI , 57%-66 % ) or after 12 cycles of attempt ( 82 % [ 95 % CI , 70%-89 % ] vs 75 % [ 95 % CI , 70%-78 % ] , respectively ) . Women with high urinary FSH values ( > 11.5 mIU/mg creatinine [ n = 69 ] ) did not have a significantly different predicted probability of conceiving after 6 cycles of attempt ( 61 % ; 95 % CI , 46%-74 % ) compared with women ( n = 660 ) with normal values ( 62 % ; 95 % CI , 58%-66 % ) or after 12 cycles of attempt ( 70 % [ 95 % CI , 54%-80 % ] vs 76 % [ 95 % CI , 72%-80 % ] , respectively ) . Inhibin B levels ( n = 737 ) were not associated with the probability of conceiving in a given cycle ( hazard ratio per 1-pg/mL increase , 0.999 ; 95 % CI , 0.997 - 1.001 ) . Conclusions and Relevance Among women aged 30 to 44 years without a history of infertility who had been trying to conceive for 3 months or less , biomarkers indicating diminished ovarian reserve compared with normal ovarian reserve were not associated with reduced fertility . These findings do not support the use of urinary or blood follicle-stimulating hormone tests or antimüllerian hormone levels to assess natural fertility for women with these characteristics .

67,"Subdividing proliferating tissues into compartments is an evolutionarily conserved strategy of animal development [ 1 - 6 ] . Signals across boundaries between compartments can result in local expression of secreted proteins organizing growth and patterning of tissues [ 1 - 6 ] . Sharp and straight interfaces between compartments are crucial for stabilizing the position of such organizers and therefore for precise implementation of body plans . Maintaining boundaries in proliferating tissues requires mechanisms to counteract cell rearrangements caused by cell division ; however , the nature of such mechanisms remains unclear . Here we quantitatively analyzed cell morphology and the response to the laser ablation of cell bonds in the vicinity of the anteroposterior compartment boundary in developing Drosophila wings . We found that mechanical tension is approximately 2.5-fold increased on cell bonds along this compartment boundary as compared to the remaining tissue . Cell bond tension is decreased in the presence of Y-27632 [ 7 ] , an inhibitor of Rho-kinase whose main effector is Myosin II [ 8 ] . Simulations using a vertex model [ 9 ] demonstrate that a 2.5-fold increase in local cell bond tension suffices to guide the rearrangement of cells after cell division to maintain compartment boundaries . Our results provide a physical mechanism in which the local increase in Myosin II-dependent cell bond tension directs cell sorting at compartment boundaries . As organisms develop , their tissues can become separated into distinct cell populations through the establishment of compartment boundaries . Compartment boundaries have been discovered in a wide variety of tissues , but in many cases the molecular mechanisms that separate cells remain poorly understood . In the Drosophila wing , a stripe of Notch activation maintains the dorsal-ventral compartment boundary , through a process that depends on the actin cytoskeleton . Here , we show that the dorsal-ventral boundary exhibits a distinct accumulation of Myosin II , and that this accumulation is regulated downstream of Notch signaling . Conversely , the dorsal-ventral boundary is depleted for the Par-3 homologue Bazooka . We further show that mutations in the Myosin heavy chain subunit encoded by zipper can impair dorsal-ventral compartmentalization without affecting anterior-posterior compartmentalization . These observations identify a distinct accumulation and requirement for Myosin activity in dorsal-ventral compartmentalization , and suggest a novel mechanism in which contractile tension along an F-actin cable at the compartment boundary contributes to compartmentalization .

69,"IMPORTANCE There is currently no consensus for the screening and treatment of patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA ) in extremely preterm infants . Less pharmacological closure and more supportive management have been observed without evidence to support these changes . OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between early screening echocardiography for PDA and in-hospital mortality . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Comparison of screened and not screened preterm infants enrolled in the EPIPAGE 2 national prospective population-based cohort study that included all preterm infants born at less than 29 weeks of gestation and hospitalized in 68 neonatal intensive care units in France from April through December 2011 . Two main analyses were performed to adjust for potential selection bias , one using propensity score matching and one using neonatal unit preference for early screening echocardiography as an instrumental variable . EXPOSURES Early screening echocardiography before day 3 of life . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was death between day 3 and discharge . The secondary outcomes were major neonatal morbidities ( pulmonary hemorrhage , severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia , severe cerebral lesions , and necrotizing enterocolitis ) . RESULTS Among the 1513 preterm infants with data available to determine exposure , 847 were screened for PDA and 666 were not ; 605 infants from each group could be paired . Exposed infants were treated for PDA more frequently during their hospitalization than nonexposed infants ( 55.1 % vs 43.1 % ; odds ratio [ OR ] , 1.62 [ 95 % CI , 1.31 to 2.00 ] ; absolute risk reduction [ ARR ] in events per 100 infants , -12.0 [ 95 % CI , -17.3 to -6.7 ) . Exposed infants had a lower hospital death rate ( 14.2 % vs 18.5 % ; OR , 0.73 [ 95 % CI , 0.54 to 0.98 ] ; ARR , 4.3 [ 95 % CI , 0.3 to 8.3 ] ) and a lower rate of pulmonary hemorrhage ( 5.6 % vs 8.9 % ; OR , 0.60 [ 95 % CI , 0.38 to 0.95 ] ; ARR , 3.3 [ 95 % CI , 0.4 to 6.3 ] ) . No differences in rates of necrotizing enterocolitis , severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia , or severe cerebral lesions were observed . In the overall cohort , instrumental variable analysis yielded an adjusted OR for in-hospital mortality of 0.62 [ 95 % CI , 0.37 to 1.04 ] .

70,"IMPORTANCE There is currently no consensus for the screening and treatment of patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA ) in extremely preterm infants . Less pharmacological closure and more supportive management have been observed without evidence to support these changes . OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between early screening echocardiography for PDA and in-hospital mortality . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Comparison of screened and not screened preterm infants enrolled in the EPIPAGE 2 national prospective population-based cohort study that included all preterm infants born at less than 29 weeks of gestation and hospitalized in 68 neonatal intensive care units in France from April through December 2011 . Two main analyses were performed to adjust for potential selection bias , one using propensity score matching and one using neonatal unit preference for early screening echocardiography as an instrumental variable . EXPOSURES Early screening echocardiography before day 3 of life . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was death between day 3 and discharge . The secondary outcomes were major neonatal morbidities ( pulmonary hemorrhage , severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia , severe cerebral lesions , and necrotizing enterocolitis ) . RESULTS Among the 1513 preterm infants with data available to determine exposure , 847 were screened for PDA and 666 were not ; 605 infants from each group could be paired . Exposed infants were treated for PDA more frequently during their hospitalization than nonexposed infants ( 55.1 % vs 43.1 % ; odds ratio [ OR ] , 1.62 [ 95 % CI , 1.31 to 2.00 ] ; absolute risk reduction [ ARR ] in events per 100 infants , -12.0 [ 95 % CI , -17.3 to -6.7 ) . Exposed infants had a lower hospital death rate ( 14.2 % vs 18.5 % ; OR , 0.73 [ 95 % CI , 0.54 to 0.98 ] ; ARR , 4.3 [ 95 % CI , 0.3 to 8.3 ] ) and a lower rate of pulmonary hemorrhage ( 5.6 % vs 8.9 % ; OR , 0.60 [ 95 % CI , 0.38 to 0.95 ] ; ARR , 3.3 [ 95 % CI , 0.4 to 6.3 ] ) . No differences in rates of necrotizing enterocolitis , severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia , or severe cerebral lesions were observed . In the overall cohort , instrumental variable analysis yielded an adjusted OR for in-hospital mortality of 0.62 [ 95 % CI , 0.37 to 1.04 ] . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this national population-based cohort of extremely preterm infants , screening echocardiography before day 3 of life was associated with lower in-hospital mortality and likelihood of pulmonary hemorrhage but not with differences in necrotizing enterocolitis , severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia , or severe cerebral lesions .

73,"Traditionally , vaccine development involves tradeoffs between immunogenicity and safety . Live-attenuated vaccines typically offer rapid and durable immunity but have reduced safety when compared to inactivated vaccines . In contrast , the inability of inactivated vaccines to replicate enhances safety at the expense of immunogenicity , often necessitating multiple doses and boosters . To overcome these tradeoffs , we developed the insect-specific alphavirus , Eilat virus ( EILV ) , as a vaccine platform . To address the chikungunya fever ( CHIKF ) pandemic , we used an EILV cDNA clone to design a chimeric virus containing the chikungunya virus ( CHIKV ) structural proteins . The recombinant EILV/CHIKV was structurally identical at 10 Å to wild-type CHIKV , as determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy , and it mimicked the early stages of CHIKV replication in vertebrate cells from attachment and entry to viral RNA delivery . Yet the recombinant virus remained completely defective for productive replication , providing a high degree of safety . A single dose of EILV/CHIKV produced in mosquito cells elicited rapid ( within 4 d ) and long-lasting ( > 290 d ) neutralizing antibodies that provided complete protection in two different mouse models . In nonhuman primates , EILV/CHIKV elicited rapid and robust immunity that protected against viremia and telemetrically monitored fever .

74,"BACKGROUND Mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) is a critical activator of inflammation and the innate immune system . However , mtDNA level has not been tested for its role as a biomarker in the intensive care unit ( ICU ) . We hypothesized that circulating cell-free mtDNA levels would be associated with mortality and improve risk prediction in ICU patients . METHODS AND FINDINGS Analyses of mtDNA levels were performed on blood samples obtained from two prospective observational cohort studies of ICU patients ( the Brigham and Women 's Hospital Registry of Critical Illness [ BWH RoCI , n = 200 ] and Molecular Epidemiology of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome [ ME ARDS , n = 243 ] ) . mtDNA levels in plasma were assessed by measuring the copy number of the NADH dehydrogenase 1 gene using quantitative real-time PCR . Medical ICU patients with an elevated mtDNA level ( ≥3,200 copies/µl plasma ) had increased odds of dying within 28 d of ICU admission in both the BWH RoCI ( odds ratio [ OR ] 7.5 , 95 % CI 3.6 - 15.8 , p = 1 × 10(-7 ) ) and ME ARDS ( OR 8.4 , 95 % CI 2.9 - 24.2 , p = 9 × 10(-5 ) ) cohorts , while no evidence for association was noted in non-medical ICU patients . The addition of an elevated mtDNA level improved the net reclassification index ( NRI ) of 28-d mortality among medical ICU patients when added to clinical models in both the BWH RoCI ( NRI 79 % , standard error 14 % , p<1 × 10(-4 ) ) and ME ARDS ( NRI 55 % , standard error 20 % , p = 0.007 ) cohorts . In the BWH RoCI cohort , those with an elevated mtDNA level had an increased risk of death , even in analyses limited to patients with sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome . Study limitations include the lack of data elucidating the concise pathological roles of mtDNA in the patients , and the limited numbers of measurements for some of biomarkers . CONCLUSIONS Increased mtDNA levels are associated with ICU mortality , and inclusion of mtDNA level improves risk prediction in medical ICU patients . Our data suggest that mtDNA could serve as a viable plasma biomarker in medical ICU patients .

Activation of AgRP neurons by fasting , as assessed by c-Fos , Agrp and Npy mRNA expression , AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs , depolarization and firing rates , required NMDARs . Furthermore , AgRP but not POMC neurons have dendritic spines and increased glutamatergic input onto AgRP neurons caused by fasting was paralleled by an increase in spines , suggesting fasting induced synaptogenesis and spinogenesis . Thus glutamatergic synaptic transmission and its modulation by NMDARs play key roles in controlling AgRP neurons and determining the cellular and behavioral response to fasting . The importance of neuropeptides in the hypothalamus has been experimentally established . Due to difficulties in assessing function in vivo , the roles of the fast-acting neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA are largely unknown . Synaptic vesicular transporters ( VGLUTs for glutamate and VGAT for GABA ) are required for vesicular uptake and , consequently , synaptic release of neurotransmitters . Ventromedial hypothalamic ( VMH ) neurons are predominantly glutamatergic and express VGLUT2 . To evaluate the role of glutamate release from VMH neurons , we generated mice lacking VGLUT2 selectively in SF1 neurons ( a major subset of VMH neurons ) . These mice have hypoglycemia during fasting secondary to impaired fasting-induced increases in the glucose-raising pancreatic hormone glucagon and impaired induction in liver of mRNAs encoding PGC-1alpha and the gluconeogenic enzymes PEPCK and G6Pase . Similarly , these mice have defective counterregulatory responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and 2-deoxyglucose ( an antimetabolite ) . Thus , glutamate release from VMH neurons is an important component of the neurocircuitry that functions to prevent hypoglycemia . Glial cells perform critical functions that alter the metabolism and activity of neurons , and there is increasing interest in their role in appetite and energy balance . Leptin , a key regulator of appetite and metabolism , has previously been reported to influence glial structural proteins and morphology . Here , we demonstrate that metabolic status and leptin also modify astrocyte-specific glutamate and glucose transporters , indicating that metabolic signals influence synaptic efficacy and glucose uptake and , ultimately , neuronal function . We found that basal and glucose-stimulated electrical activity of hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin ( POMC ) neurons in mice were altered in the offspring of mothers fed a high-fat diet . In adulthood , increased body weight and fasting also altered the expression of glucose and glutamate transporters . These results demonstrate that whole-organism metabolism alters hypothalamic glial cell activity and suggest that these cells play an important role in the pathology of obesity . The melanocortin receptor 4 ( MC4R ) is a well-established mediator of body weight homeostasis . However , the neurotransmitter(s ) that mediate MC4R function remain largely unknown ; as a result , little is known about the second-order neurons of the MC4R neural pathway . Single-minded 1 (Sim1)-expressing brain regions , which include the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus ( PVH ) , represent key brain sites that mediate melanocortin action . We conditionally restored MC4R expression in Sim1 neurons in the background of Mc4r-null mice . The restoration dramatically reduced obesity in Mc4r-null mice . The anti-obesity effect was completely reversed by selective disruption of glutamate release from those same Sim1 neurons . The reversal was caused by lower energy expenditure and hyperphagia . Corroboratively , selective disruption of glutamate release from adult PVH neurons led to rapid obesity development via reduced energy expenditure and hyperphagia . Thus , this study establishes glutamate as the primary neurotransmitter that mediates MC4Rs on Sim1 neurons in body weight regulation .

76,"Inflammation induced by recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns markedly affects subsequent adaptive responses . We asked whether the adaptive immune system can also affect the character and magnitude of innate inflammatory responses . We found that the response of memory , but not naive , CD4 + T cells enhances production of multiple innate inflammatory cytokines and chemokines ( IICs ) in the lung and that , during influenza infection , this leads to early control of virus . Memory CD4 + T cell – induced IICs and viral control require cognate antigen recognition and are optimal when memory cells are either T helper type 1 ( TH1 ) or TH17 polarized but are independent of interferon-γ ( IFN-γ ) and tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) production and do not require activation of conserved pathogen recognition pathways .

77,"BACKGROUND Although cigarette smoking , excessive alcohol drinking , obesity , and several other well-studied unhealthy lifestyle-related factors each have been linked to the risk of multiple chronic diseases and premature death , little is known about the combined impact on mortality outcomes , in particular among Chinese and other non-Western populations . The objective of this study was to quantify the overall impact of lifestyle-related factors beyond that of active cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption on all-cause and cause-specific mortality in Chinese women . METHODS AND FINDINGS We used data from the Shanghai Women 's Health Study , an ongoing population-based prospective cohort study in China . Participants included 71,243 women aged 40 to 70 years enrolled during 1996 - 2000 who never smoked or drank alcohol regularly . A healthy lifestyle score was created on the basis of five lifestyle-related factors shown to be independently associated with mortality outcomes ( normal weight , lower waist-hip ratio , daily exercise , never exposed to spouse 's smoking , higher daily fruit and vegetable intake ) . The score ranged from zero ( least healthy ) to five ( most healthy ) points . During an average follow-up of 9 years , 2,860 deaths occurred , including 775 from cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) and 1,351 from cancer . Adjusted hazard ratios for mortality decreased progressively with an increasing number of healthy lifestyle factors . Compared to women with a score of zero , hazard ratios ( 95 % confidence intervals ) for women with four to five factors were 0.57 ( 0.44 - 0.74 ) for total mortality , 0.29 ( 0.16 - 0.54 ) for CVD mortality , and 0.76 ( 0.54 - 1.06 ) for cancer mortality . The inverse association between the healthy lifestyle score and mortality was seen consistently regardless of chronic disease status at baseline . The population attributable risks for not having 4 - 5 healthy lifestyle factors were 33 % for total deaths , 59 % for CVD deaths , and 19 % for cancer deaths . CONCLUSIONS In this first study , to our knowledge , to quantify the combined impact of lifestyle-related factors on mortality outcomes in Chinese women , a healthier lifestyle pattern-including being of normal weight , lower central adiposity , participation in physical activity , nonexposure to spousal smoking , and higher fruit and vegetable intake-was associated with reductions in total and cause-specific mortality among lifetime nonsmoking and nondrinking women , supporting the importance of overall lifestyle modification in disease prevention .

78,"OBJECTIVE To determine whether higher past exposure to particulate air pollution is associated with prevalent high symptoms of anxiety . DESIGN Observational cohort study . SETTING Nurses ' Health Study . PARTICIPANTS 71,271 women enrolled in the Nurses ' Health Study residing throughout the contiguous United States who had valid estimates on exposure to particulate matter for at least one exposure period of interest and data on anxiety symptoms . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Meaningfully high symptoms of anxiety , defined as a score of 6 points or greater on the phobic anxiety subscale of the Crown-Crisp index , administered in 2004 . RESULTS The 71,271 eligible women were aged between 57 and 85 years ( mean 70 years ) at the time of assessment of anxiety symptoms , with a prevalence of high anxiety symptoms of 15 % . Exposure to particulate matter was characterized using estimated average exposure to particulate matter < 2.5 μm in diameter ( PM2.5 ) and 2.5 to 10 μm in diameter ( PM2.5 - 10 ) in the one month , three months , six months , one year , and 15 years prior to assessment of anxiety symptoms , and residential distance to the nearest major road two years prior to assessment . Significantly increased odds of high anxiety symptoms were observed with higher exposure to PM2.5 for multiple averaging periods ( for example , odds ratio per 10 µg/m(3 ) increase in prior one month average PM2.5 : 1.12 , 95 % confidence interval 1.06 to 1.19 ; in prior 12 month average PM2.5 : 1.15 , 1.06 to 1.26 ) . Models including multiple exposure windows suggested short term averaging periods were more relevant than long term averaging periods . There was no association between anxiety and exposure to PM2.5 - 10 . Residential proximity to major roads was not related to anxiety symptoms in a dose dependent manner . CONCLUSIONS Exposure to fine particulate matter ( PM2.5 ) was associated with high symptoms of anxiety , with more recent exposures potentially more relevant than more distant exposures . Research evaluating whether reductions in exposure to ambient PM2.5 would reduce the population level burden of clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety is warranted .

79,"CONTEXT Exogenous estrogen use may lower risk of dementia in postmenopausal women . A relationship between long-term exposure to endogenous estrogens and incident dementia has been hypothesized but not studied . OBJECTIVE To determine whether a longer reproductive period , as an indicator of longer exposure to endogenous estrogens , is associated with lower risk of dementia and Alzheimer disease ( AD ) in women who have natural menopause . DESIGN AND SETTING The Rotterdam Study , a population-based prospective cohort study conducted in the Netherlands . PARTICIPANTS A total of 3601 women aged 55 years or older who did not have dementia at baseline ( 1990 - 1993 ) and had information on age at menarche , age at menopause , and type of menopause . Participants were reexamined in 1993 - 1994 and 1997 - 1999 and were continuously monitored for development of dementia . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Incidence of dementia , based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Revised Third Edition criteria , and AD , based on National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer 's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria , compared by quartiles of reproductive period among women with natural menopause . RESULTS During 21 046 person-years of follow-up ( median follow-up , 6.3 years ) , 199 women developed dementia , including 159 who developed AD . After adjusting for age , dementia was not clearly associated with length of reproductive period . However , after adjusting for multiple covariates , women with natural menopause and more reproductive years had an increased risk of dementia ( adjusted rate ratio [ RR ] for women with > 39 reproductive years [ highest quartile ] compared with < 34 reproductive years [ lowest quartile ] , 1.78 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.12 - 2.84 ) . The adjusted RR per year of increase was 1.04 ( 95 % CI , 1.01 - 1.08 ) . For risk of AD , the adjusted RRs were 1.51 ( 95 % CI , 0.91 - 2.50 ) and 1.03 ( 95 % CI , 1.00 - 1.07 ) , respectively .

80,"CONTEXT Exogenous estrogen use may lower risk of dementia in postmenopausal women . A relationship between long-term exposure to endogenous estrogens and incident dementia has been hypothesized but not studied . OBJECTIVE To determine whether a longer reproductive period , as an indicator of longer exposure to endogenous estrogens , is associated with lower risk of dementia and Alzheimer disease ( AD ) in women who have natural menopause . DESIGN AND SETTING The Rotterdam Study , a population-based prospective cohort study conducted in the Netherlands . PARTICIPANTS A total of 3601 women aged 55 years or older who did not have dementia at baseline ( 1990 - 1993 ) and had information on age at menarche , age at menopause , and type of menopause . Participants were reexamined in 1993 - 1994 and 1997 - 1999 and were continuously monitored for development of dementia . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Incidence of dementia , based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Revised Third Edition criteria , and AD , based on National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer 's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria , compared by quartiles of reproductive period among women with natural menopause . RESULTS During 21 046 person-years of follow-up ( median follow-up , 6.3 years ) , 199 women developed dementia , including 159 who developed AD . After adjusting for age , dementia was not clearly associated with length of reproductive period . However , after adjusting for multiple covariates , women with natural menopause and more reproductive years had an increased risk of dementia ( adjusted rate ratio [ RR ] for women with > 39 reproductive years [ highest quartile ] compared with < 34 reproductive years [ lowest quartile ] , 1.78 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.12 - 2.84 ) . The adjusted RR per year of increase was 1.04 ( 95 % CI , 1.01 - 1.08 ) . For risk of AD , the adjusted RRs were 1.51 ( 95 % CI , 0.91 - 2.50 ) and 1.03 ( 95 % CI , 1.00 - 1.07 ) , respectively . Risk of dementia associated with a longer reproductive period was most pronounced in APOE epsilon4 carriers ( adjusted RR for > 39 reproductive years compared with < 34 reproductive years , 4.20 [ 95 % CI , 1.97 - 8.92 ] for dementia and 3.42 [ 95 % CI , 1.51 - 7.75 ] for AD ) , whereas in noncarriers , no clear association with dementia or AD was observed .

81,"BACKGROUND Fibroblast growth factor 21 ( FGF21 ) is a metabolic hormone with pleiotropic effects on glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity . It acts as a key downstream target of both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and γ , the agonists of which have been used for lipid lowering and insulin sensitization , respectively . However , the role of FGF21 in the cardiovascular system remains elusive . METHODS AND RESULTS The roles of FGF21 in atherosclerosis were investigated by evaluating the impact of FGF21 deficiency and replenishment with recombinant FGF21 in apolipoprotein E(-/- ) mice . FGF21 deficiency causes a marked exacerbation of atherosclerotic plaque formation and premature death in apolipoprotein E(-/- ) mice , which is accompanied by hypoadiponectinemia and severe hypercholesterolemia . Replenishment of FGF21 protects against atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E(-/-)mice via 2 independent mechanisms , inducing the adipocyte production of adiponectin , which in turn acts on the blood vessels to inhibit neointima formation and macrophage inflammation , and suppressing the hepatic expression of the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 , thereby leading to reduced cholesterol synthesis and attenuation of hypercholesterolemia . Chronic treatment with adiponectin partially reverses atherosclerosis without obvious effects on hypercholesterolemia in FGF21-deficient apolipoprotein E(-/- ) mice . By contrast , the cholesterol-lowering effects of FGF21 are abrogated by hepatic expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 . CONCLUSIONS FGF21 protects against atherosclerosis via fine tuning the multiorgan crosstalk among liver , adipose tissue , and blood vessels .

82,"The Sir2 deacetylase modulates organismal life-span in various species . However , the molecular mechanisms by which Sir2 increases longevity are largely unknown . We show that in mammalian cells , the Sir2 homolog SIRT1 appears to control the cellular response to stress by regulating the FOXO family of Forkhead transcription factors , a family of proteins that function as sensors of the insulin signaling pathway and as regulators of organismal longevity . SIRT1 and the FOXO transcription factor FOXO3 formed a complex in cells in response to oxidative stress , and SIRT1 deacetylated FOXO3 in vitro and within cells . SIRT1 had a dual effect on FOXO3 function : SIRT1 increased FOXO3 's ability to induce cell cycle arrest and resistance to oxidative stress but inhibited FOXO3 's ability to induce cell death . Thus , one way in which members of the Sir2 family of proteins may increase organismal longevity is by tipping FOXO-dependent responses away from apoptosis and toward stress resistance .

Nevertheless , a thorough understanding of the mechanisms by which sequence-specific transcription factors modulate expression of genes required for autophagy is lacking . Here , we identify Foxk proteins ( Foxk1 and Foxk2 ) as transcriptional repressors of autophagy in muscle cells and fibroblasts . Interestingly , Foxk1/2 serve to counter-balance another forkhead transcription factor , Foxo3 , which induces an overlapping set of autophagic and atrophic targets in muscle .

88,"Although mast cell functions have classically been related to allergic responses , recent studies indicate that these cells contribute to other common diseases such as multiple sclerosis , rheumatoid arthritis , atherosclerosis , aortic aneurysm and cancer . This study presents evidence that mast cells also contribute to diet-induced obesity and diabetes .

Furthermore , in the context of mice on a Western diet , genetically induced deficiency of mast cells , or their pharmacological stabilization , reduces body weight gain and levels of inflammatory cytokines , chemokines and proteases in serum and WAT , in concert with improved glucose homeostasis and energy expenditure . Mechanistic studies reveal that mast cells contribute to WAT and muscle angiogenesis and associated cell apoptosis and cathepsin activity . Adoptive transfer experiments of cytokine-deficient mast cells show that these cells , by producing interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) , contribute to mouse adipose tissue cysteine protease cathepsin expression , apoptosis and angiogenesis , thereby promoting diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance .

89,"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome ( HGPS ) is a childhood premature aging disease caused by a spontaneous point mutation in lamin A ( encoded by LMNA ) , one of the major architectural elements of the mammalian cell nucleus . The HGPS mutation activates an aberrant cryptic splice site in LMNA pre-mRNA , leading to synthesis of a truncated lamin A protein and concomitant reduction in wild-type lamin A. Fibroblasts from individuals with HGPS have severe morphological abnormalities in nuclear envelope structure . Here we show that the cellular disease phenotype is reversible in cells from individuals with HGPS . Introduction of wild-type lamin A protein does not rescue the cellular disease symptoms . The mutant LMNA mRNA and lamin A protein can be efficiently eliminated by correction of the aberrant splicing event using a modified oligonucleotide targeted to the activated cryptic splice site . Upon splicing correction , HGPS fibroblasts assume normal nuclear morphology , the aberrant nuclear distribution and cellular levels of lamina-associated proteins are rescued , defects in heterochromatin-specific histone modifications are corrected and proper expression of several misregulated genes is reestablished .

90,"Although GBP1 ( guanylate binding protein 1 ) was among the first interferon-inducible proteins identified , its function is still largely unknown . Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) activation by amplification or mutation is one of the most frequent genetic lesions in a variety of human tumors . These include glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) , which is characterized by independent but interrelated features of extensive invasion into normal brain parenchyma , rapid growth , necrosis , and angiogenesis . In this study , we show that EGFR activation promoted GBP1 expression in GBM cell lines through a signaling pathway involving Src and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase . Moreover , we identified YY1 ( Yin Yang 1 ) as the downstream transcriptional regulator regulating EGFR-driven GBP1 expression . GBP1 was required for EGFR-mediated MMP1 ( matrix metalloproteinase 1 ) expression and glioma cell invasion in vitro . Although deregulation of GBP1 expression did not affect glioma cell proliferation , overexpression of GBP1 enhanced glioma cell invasion through MMP1 induction , which required its C-terminal helical domain and was independent of its GTPase activity . Reducing GBP1 levels by RNA interference in invasive GBM cells also markedly inhibited their ability to infiltrate the brain parenchyma of mice . GBP1 expression was high and positively correlated with EGFR expression in human GBM tumors and cell lines , particularly those of the neural subtype . Together , these findings establish GBP1 as a previously unknown link between EGFR activity and MMP1 expression and nominate it as a novel potential therapeutic target for inhibiting GBM invasion .

91,"Although blood – brain barrier ( BBB ) compromise is central to the etiology of diverse central nervous system ( CNS ) disorders , endothelial receptor proteins that control BBB function are poorly defined . The endothelial G-protein-coupled receptor ( GPCR ) Gpr124 has been reported to be required for normal forebrain angiogenesis and BBB function in mouse embryos , but the role of this receptor in adult animals is unknown . Here Gpr124 conditional knockout ( CKO ) in the endothelia of adult mice did not affect homeostatic BBB integrity , but resulted in BBB disruption and microvascular hemorrhage in mouse models of both ischemic stroke and glioblastoma , accompanied by reduced cerebrovascular canonical Wnt – β-catenin signaling . Constitutive activation of Wnt – β-catenin signaling fully corrected the BBB disruption and hemorrhage defects of Gpr124-CKO mice , with rescue of the endothelial gene tight junction , pericyte coverage and extracellular-matrix deficits .

93,"BACKGROUND Endometrial cancer incidence is continuing to rise in the wake of the current ageing and obesity epidemics . Much of the risk for endometrial cancer development is influenced by the environment and lifestyle . Accumulating evidence suggests that the epigenome serves as the interface between the genome and the environment and that hypermethylation of stem cell polycomb group target genes is an epigenetic hallmark of cancer . The objective of this study was to determine the functional role of epigenetic factors in endometrial cancer development . METHODS AND FINDINGS Epigenome-wide methylation analysis of > 27,000 CpG sites in endometrial cancer tissue samples ( n = 64 ) and control samples ( n = 23 ) revealed that HAND2 ( a gene encoding a transcription factor expressed in the endometrial stroma ) is one of the most commonly hypermethylated and silenced genes in endometrial cancer . A novel integrative epigenome-transcriptome-interactome analysis further revealed that HAND2 is the hub of the most highly ranked differential methylation hotspot in endometrial cancer . These findings were validated using candidate gene methylation analysis in multiple clinical sample sets of tissue samples from a total of 272 additional women . Increased HAND2 methylation was a feature of premalignant endometrial lesions and was seen to parallel a decrease in RNA and protein levels . Furthermore , women with high endometrial HAND2 methylation in their premalignant lesions were less likely to respond to progesterone treatment . HAND2 methylation analysis of endometrial secretions collected using high vaginal swabs taken from women with postmenopausal bleeding specifically identified those patients with early stage endometrial cancer with both high sensitivity and high specificity ( receiver operating characteristics area under the curve = 0.91 for stage 1A and 0.97 for higher than stage 1A ) . Finally , mice harbouring a Hand2 knock-out specifically in their endometrium were shown to develop precancerous endometrial lesions with increasing age , and these lesions also demonstrated a lack of PTEN expression . CONCLUSIONS HAND2 methylation is a common and crucial molecular alteration in endometrial cancer that could potentially be employed as a biomarker for early detection of endometrial cancer and as a predictor of treatment response . The true clinical utility of HAND2 DNA methylation , however , requires further validation in prospective studies . Please see later in the article for the Editors ' Summary .

94,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association of overall and specific headaches with volume of white matter hyperintensities , brain infarcts , and cognition . DESIGN Population based , cross sectional study . SETTING Epidemiology of Vascular Ageing study , Nantes , France . PARTICIPANTS 780 participants ( mean age 69 , 58.5 % women ) with detailed headache assessment . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Brain scans were evaluated for volume of white matter hyperintensities ( by fully automated imaging processing ) and for classification of infarcts ( by visual reading with a standardised assessment grid ) . Cognitive function was assessed by a battery of tests including the mini-mental state examination . RESULTS 163 ( 20.9 % ) participants reported a history of severe headache and 116 had migraine , of whom 17 ( 14.7 % ) reported aura symptoms . An association was found between any history of severe headache and increasing volume of white matter hyperintensities . The adjusted odds ratio of being in the highest third for total volume of white matter hyperintensities was 2.0 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.3 to 3.1 , P for trend 0.002 ) for participants with any history of severe headache when compared with participants without severe headache being in the lowest third . The association pattern was similar for all headache types . Migraine with aura was the only headache type strongly associated with volume of deep white matter hyperintensities ( highest third odds ratio 12.4 , 1.6 to 99.4 , P for trend 0.005 ) and with brain infarcts ( 3.4 , 1.2 to 9.3 ) . The location of infarcts was predominantly outside the cerebellum and brain stem . Evidence was lacking for cognitive impairment for any headache type with or without brain lesions . CONCLUSIONS In this population based study , any history of severe headache was associated with an increased volume of white matter hyperintensities . Migraine with aura was the only headache type associated with brain infarcts . Evidence that headache of any type by itself or in combination with brain lesions was associated with cognitive impairment was lacking .

95,"CONTEXT The mechanisms that drive progression from fatty liver to steatohepatitis and cirrhosis are unknown . In animal models , obese mice with fatty livers are vulnerable to liver adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) depletion and necrosis , suggesting that altered hepatic energy homeostasis may be involved . OBJECTIVE To determine if patients with fatty liver disease exhibit impaired recovery from hepatic ATP depletion . DESIGN Laboratory analysis of liver ATP stores monitored by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy before and after transient hepatic ATP depletion was induced by fructose injection . The study was conducted between July 15 and August 30 , 1998 . SETTING University hospital . PATIENTS Eight consecutive adults with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and 7 healthy age- and sex-matched controls . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Level of ATP 1 hour after fructose infusion in patients vs controls . RESULTS In patients , serum aminotransferase levels were increased ( P = .02 vs controls ) ; albumin and bilirubin values were normal and clinical evidence of portal hypertension was absent in both groups . However , 2 patients had moderate fibrosis and 1 had cirrhosis on liver biopsy . Mean serum glucose , cholesterol , and triglyceride levels were similar between groups but patients weighed significantly more than controls ( P = .02 ) . Liver ATP levels were similar in the 2 groups before fructose infusion and decreased similarly in both after fructose infusion ( P = .01 vs initial ATP levels ) . However , controls replenished their hepatic ATP stores during the 1-hour follow-up period ( P<.02 vs minimum ATP ) but patients did not . Hence , patients ' hepatic ATP levels were lower than those of controls at the end of the study ( P = .04 ) . Body mass index ( BMI ) correlated inversely with ATP recovery , even in controls ( R = -0.768 ; P = .07 ) . Although BMI was greater in patients than controls ( P = .02 ) and correlated strongly with fatty liver and serum aminotransferase elevations , neither of the latter 2 parameters nor the histologic severity of fibrosis strongly predicted hepatic ATP recovery . CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that recovery from hepatic ATP depletion becomes progressively less efficient as body mass increases in healthy controls and is severely impaired in patients with obesity-related nonalcoholic steatohepatitis .

97,"Tuberculosis and helminthic infections coexist in many parts of the world , yet the impact of helminth-elicited Th2 responses on the ability of the host to control Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) infection has not been fully explored . We show that mice infected with the intestinal helminth Nippostrongylus brasiliensis ( Nb ) exhibit a transitory impairment of resistance to airborne Mtb infection . Furthermore , a second dose of Nb infection substantially increases the bacterial burden in the lungs of co-infected mice . Interestingly , the Th2 response in the co-infected animals did not impair the onset and development of the protective Mtb-specific Th1 cellular immune responses . However , the helminth-induced Th2 environment resulted in the accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages ( AAMs ) in the lung . Co-infected mice lacking interleukin ( IL ) 4Rα exhibited improved ability to control Mtb infection , which was accompanied by significantly reduced accumulation of AAMs . Moreover , IL-4Rα(-/- ) mice adoptively transferred with wild-type macrophages had a significantly higher Mtb load in their lungs compared with those that received IL-4Rα(-/- ) macrophages , suggesting a direct contribution for the IL-4R pathway to the heightened susceptibility of co-infected animals .

98,"Intestinal microbiota metabolism of choline and phosphatidylcholine produces trimethylamine ( TMA ) , which is further metabolized to a proatherogenic species , trimethylamine-N-oxide ( TMAO ) . We demonstrate here that metabolism by intestinal microbiota of dietary L-carnitine , a trimethylamine abundant in red meat , also produces TMAO and accelerates atherosclerosis in mice . Omnivorous human subjects produced more TMAO than did vegans or vegetarians following ingestion of L-carnitine through a microbiota-dependent mechanism . The presence of specific bacterial taxa in human feces was associated with both plasma TMAO concentration and dietary status . Plasma L-carnitine levels in subjects undergoing cardiac evaluation ( n = 2,595 ) predicted increased risks for both prevalent cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) and incident major adverse cardiac events ( myocardial infarction , stroke or death ) , but only among subjects with concurrently high TMAO levels . Chronic dietary L-carnitine supplementation in mice altered cecal microbial composition , markedly enhanced synthesis of TMA and TMAO , and increased atherosclerosis , but this did not occur if intestinal microbiota was concurrently suppressed .

99,"Somatic cell nuclear transfer ( SCNT ) technology has recently been used to generate animals with a common genetic composition . In this study , we report the derivation of a pluripotent embryonic stem ( ES ) cell line ( SCNT-hES-1 ) from a cloned human blastocyst . The SCNT-hES-1 cells displayed typical ES cell morphology and cell surface markers and were capable of differentiating into embryoid bodies in vitro and of forming teratomas in vivo containing cell derivatives from all three embryonic germ layers in severe combined immunodeficient mice . After continuous proliferation for more than 70 passages , SCNT-hES-1 cells maintained normal karyotypes and were genetically identical to the somatic nuclear donor cells . Although we can not completely exclude the possibility that the cells had a parthenogenetic origin , imprinting analyses support a SCNT origin of the derived human ES cells . Embryonic stem ( ES ) cell lines derived from human blastocysts have the developmental potential to form derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers even after prolonged culture . Here we describe the clonal derivation of two human ES cell lines , H9.1 and H9.2 . At the time of the clonal derivation of the H9.1 and H9.2 ES cell lines , the parental ES cell line , H9 , had already been continuously cultured for 6 months . After an additional 8 months of culture , H9.1 and H9.2 ES cell lines continued to : ( 1 ) actively proliferate , ( 2 ) express high levels of telomerase , and ( 3 ) retain normal karyotypes . Telomere lengths , while somewhat variable , were maintained between 8 and 12 kb in high-passage H9.1 and H9.2 cells . High-passage H9.1 and H9.2 cells both formed teratomas in SCID-beige mice that included differentiated derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers . These results demonstrate the pluripotency of single human ES cells , the maintenance of pluripotency during an extended period of culture , and the long-term self-renewing properties of cultured human ES cells . The remarkable developmental potential , proliferative capacity , and karyotypic stability of human ES cells distinguish them from adult cells . Embryonic stem cells have the ability to remain undifferentiated and proliferate indefinitely in vitro while maintaining the potential to differentiate into derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers . These cells have , therefore , potential for in vitro differentiation studies , gene function , and so on . The aim of this study was to produce a human embryonic stem cell line . An inner cell mass of a human blastocyst was separated and cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblasts in embryonic stem cell medium with related additives . The established line was evaluated by morphology ; passaging ; freezing and thawing ; alkaline phosphatase ; Oct-4 expression ; anti-surface markers including Tra-1 - 60 and Tra-1 - 81 ; and karyotype and spontaneous differentiation . Differentiated cardiomyocytes and neurons were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry . Here , we report the derivation of a new embryonic stem cell line ( Royan H1 ) from a human blastocyst that remains undifferentiated in morphology during continuous passaging for more than 30 passages , maintains a normal XX karyotype , is viable after freezing and thawing , and expresses alkaline phosphatase , Oct-4 , Tra-1 - 60 , and Tra-1 - 81 . These cells remain undifferentiated when grown on mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder layers in the presence or absence of recombinant human leukemia inhibitory factor . Royan H1 cells can differentiate in vitro in the absence of feeder cells and can produce embryoid bodies that can further differentiate into beating cardiomyocytes as well as neurons . These results define Royan H1 cells as a new human embryonic stem cell line .

100,"Panic disorder is a severe anxiety disorder with recurrent , debilitating panic attacks . In individuals with panic disorder there is evidence of decreased central gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) activity as well as marked increases in autonomic and respiratory responses after intravenous infusions of hypertonic sodium lactate . In a rat model of panic disorder , chronic inhibition of GABA synthesis in the dorsomedial-perifornical hypothalamus of rats produces anxiety-like states and a similar vulnerability to sodium lactate-induced cardioexcitatory responses . The dorsomedial-perifornical hypothalamus is enriched in neurons containing orexin ( ORX , also known as hypocretin ) , which have a crucial role in arousal , vigilance and central autonomic mobilization , all of which are key components of panic . Here we show that activation of ORX-synthesizing neurons is necessary for developing a panic-prone state in the rat panic model , and either silencing of the hypothalamic gene encoding ORX ( Hcrt ) with RNAi or systemic ORX-1 receptor antagonists blocks the panic responses . Moreover , we show that human subjects with panic anxiety have elevated levels of ORX in the cerebrospinal fluid compared to subjects without panic anxiety . Taken together , our results suggest that the ORX system may be involved in the pathophysiology of panic anxiety and that ORX antagonists constitute a potential new treatment strategy for panic disorder .

101,"The importance of neuropeptides in the hypothalamus has been experimentally established . Due to difficulties in assessing function in vivo , the roles of the fast-acting neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA are largely unknown . Synaptic vesicular transporters ( VGLUTs for glutamate and VGAT for GABA ) are required for vesicular uptake and , consequently , synaptic release of neurotransmitters . Ventromedial hypothalamic ( VMH ) neurons are predominantly glutamatergic and express VGLUT2 . To evaluate the role of glutamate release from VMH neurons , we generated mice lacking VGLUT2 selectively in SF1 neurons ( a major subset of VMH neurons ) . These mice have hypoglycemia during fasting secondary to impaired fasting-induced increases in the glucose-raising pancreatic hormone glucagon and impaired induction in liver of mRNAs encoding PGC-1alpha and the gluconeogenic enzymes PEPCK and G6Pase . Similarly , these mice have defective counterregulatory responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and 2-deoxyglucose ( an antimetabolite ) . Thus , glutamate release from VMH neurons is an important component of the neurocircuitry that functions to prevent hypoglycemia . The melanocortin receptor 4 ( MC4R ) is a well-established mediator of body weight homeostasis . However , the neurotransmitter(s ) that mediate MC4R function remain largely unknown ; as a result , little is known about the second-order neurons of the MC4R neural pathway . Single-minded 1 (Sim1)-expressing brain regions , which include the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus ( PVH ) , represent key brain sites that mediate melanocortin action . We conditionally restored MC4R expression in Sim1 neurons in the background of Mc4r-null mice . The restoration dramatically reduced obesity in Mc4r-null mice . The anti-obesity effect was completely reversed by selective disruption of glutamate release from those same Sim1 neurons . The reversal was caused by lower energy expenditure and hyperphagia . Corroboratively , selective disruption of glutamate release from adult PVH neurons led to rapid obesity development via reduced energy expenditure and hyperphagia . Thus , this study establishes glutamate as the primary neurotransmitter that mediates MC4Rs on Sim1 neurons in body weight regulation .

103,"BACKGROUND Persistent inflammation has been proposed to contribute to various stages in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease . Interleukin-6 receptor ( IL6R ) signalling propagates downstream inflammation cascades . To assess whether this pathway is causally relevant to coronary heart disease , we studied a functional genetic variant known to affect IL6R signalling . METHODS In a collaborative meta-analysis , we studied Asp358Ala ( rs2228145 ) in IL6R in relation to a panel of conventional risk factors and inflammation biomarkers in 125,222 participants . We also compared the frequency of Asp358Ala in 51,441 patients with coronary heart disease and in 136,226 controls . To gain insight into possible mechanisms , we assessed Asp358Ala in relation to localised gene expression and to postlipopolysaccharide stimulation of interleukin 6 . FINDINGS The minor allele frequency of Asp358Ala was 39 % . Asp358Ala was not associated with lipid concentrations , blood pressure , adiposity , dysglycaemia , or smoking ( p value for association per minor allele ≥0·04 for each ) . By contrast , for every copy of 358Ala inherited , mean concentration of IL6R increased by 34·3 % ( 95 % CI 30·4 - 38·2 ) and of interleukin 6 by 14·6 % ( 10·7 - 18·4 ) , and mean concentration of C-reactive protein was reduced by 7·5 % ( 5·9 - 9·1 ) and of fibrinogen by 1·0 % ( 0·7 - 1·3 ) . For every copy of 358Ala inherited , risk of coronary heart disease was reduced by 3·4 % ( 1·8 - 5·0 ) . Asp358Ala was not related to IL6R mRNA levels or interleukin-6 production in monocytes .

104,"Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder in which mucosal autoantibodies to the enzyme transglutaminase 2 ( TG2 ) are generated in response to the exogenous antigen gluten in individuals who express human leukocyte antigen HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 ( ref . 3 ) . We assessed in a comprehensive and nonbiased manner the IgA anti-TG2 response by expression cloning of the antibody repertoire of ex vivo – isolated intestinal antibody-secreting cells ( ASCs ) . We found that TG2-specific plasma cells are markedly expanded within the duodenal mucosa in individuals with active celiac disease . TG2-specific antibodies were of high affinity yet showed little adaptation by somatic mutations . Unlike infection-induced peripheral blood plasmablasts , the TG2-specific ASCs had not recently proliferated and were not short-lived ex vivo . Altogether , these observations demonstrate that there is a germline repertoire with high affinity for TG2 that may favor massive generation of autoreactive B cells . TG2-specific antibodies did not block enzymatic activity and served as substrates for TG2-mediated crosslinking when expressed as IgD or IgM but not as IgA1 or IgG1 . This could result in preferential recruitment of plasma cells from naive IgD- and IgM-expressing B cells , thus possibly explaining why the antibody response to TG2 bears signs of a primary immune response despite the disease chronicity .

105,"Granulomas are the pathological hallmark of tuberculosis ( TB ) . However , their function and mechanisms of formation remain poorly understood . To understand the role of granulomas in TB , we analyzed the proteomes of granulomas from subjects with tuberculosis in an unbiased manner . Using laser-capture microdissection , mass spectrometry and confocal microscopy , we generated detailed molecular maps of human granulomas . We found that the centers of granulomas have a pro-inflammatory environment that is characterized by the presence of antimicrobial peptides , reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids . Conversely , the tissue surrounding the caseum has a comparatively anti-inflammatory signature . These findings are consistent across a set of six human subjects and in rabbits . Although the balance between systemic pro- and anti-inflammatory signals is crucial to TB disease outcome , here we find that these signals are physically segregated within each granuloma . From the protein and lipid snapshots of human and rabbit lesions analyzed here , we hypothesize that the pathologic response to TB is shaped by the precise anatomical localization of these inflammatory pathways during the development of the granuloma .

106,"BACKGROUND A sexual dimorphism exists in the incidence and prevalence of coronary artery disease -- men are more commonly affected than are age-matched women . We explored the role of the Y chromosome in coronary artery disease in the context of this sexual inequity .

On the basis of this information , each Y chromosome was tracked back into one of 13 ancient lineages defined as haplogroups . We then examined associations between common Y chromosome haplogroups and the risk of coronary artery disease in cross-sectional BHF-FHS and prospective WOSCOPS . Finally , we undertook functional analysis of Y chromosome effects on monocyte and macrophage transcriptome in British men from the Cardiogenics Study . FINDINGS Of nine haplogroups identified , two ( R1b1b2 and I ) accounted for roughly 90 % of the Y chromosome variants among British men . Carriers of haplogroup I had about a 50 % higher age-adjusted risk of coronary artery disease than did men with other Y chromosome lineages in BHF-FHS ( odds ratio 1·75 , 95 % CI 1·20 - 2·54 , p=0·004 ) , WOSCOPS ( 1·45 , 1·08 - 1·95 , p=0·012 ) , and joint analysis of both populations ( 1·56 , 1·24 - 1·97 , p=0·0002 ) .

108,"CONTEXT Although beta-blockers improve symptoms and survival in adults with heart failure , little is known about these medications in children and adolescents . OBJECTIVE To prospectively evaluate the effects of carvedilol in children and adolescents with symptomatic systemic ventricular systolic dysfunction . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS A multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study of 161 children and adolescents with symptomatic systolic heart failure from 26 US centers . In addition to treatment with conventional heart failure medications , patients were assigned to receive placebo or carvedilol . Enrollment began in June 2000 and the last dose was given in May 2005 ( each patient received medication for 8 months ) . INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to twice-daily dosing with placebo , low-dose carvedilol ( 0.2 mg/kg per dose if weight < 62.5 kg or 12.5 mg per dose if weight > or = 62.5 kg ) , or high-dose carvedilol ( 0.4 mg/kg per dose if weight < 62.5 kg or 25 mg per dose if weight > or = 62.5 kg ) and were stratified according to whether each patient 's systemic ventricle was a left ventricle or not . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was a composite measure of heart failure outcomes in patients receiving carvedilol ( low- and high-dose combined ) vs placebo . Secondary efficacy variables included individual components of this composite , echocardiographic measures , and plasma b-type natriuretic peptide levels . RESULTS There was no statistically significant difference between groups for the composite end point based on the percentage of patients who improved , worsened , or were unchanged . Among 54 patients assigned to placebo , 30 improved ( 56 % ) , 16 worsened ( 30 % ) , and 8 were unchanged ( 15 % ) ; among 103 patients assigned to carvedilol , 58 improved ( 56 % ) , 25 worsened ( 24 % ) , and 20 were unchanged ( 19 % ) . The rates of worsening were lower than expected . The odds ratio for worsened outcome for patients in the combined carvedilol group vs the placebo group was 0.79 ( 95 % CI , 0.36 - 1.59 ; P = .47 ) . A prespecified subgroup analysis noted significant interaction between treatment and ventricular morphology ( P = .02 ) , indicating a possible differential effect of treatment between patients with a systemic left ventricle ( beneficial trend ) and those whose systemic ventricle was not a left ventricle ( nonbeneficial trend ) . CONCLUSIONS These preliminary results suggest that carvedilol does not significantly improve clinical heart failure outcomes in children and adolescents with symptomatic systolic heart failure .

109,"BACKGROUND In the absence of an effective vaccine , HIV continues to spread globally , emphasizing the need for novel strategies to limit its transmission . Pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) with antiretroviral drugs could prove to be an effective intervention strategy if highly efficacious and cost-effective PrEP modalities are identified . We evaluated daily and intermittent PrEP regimens of increasing antiviral activity in a macaque model that closely resembles human transmission . METHODS AND FINDINGS We used a repeat-exposure macaque model with 14 weekly rectal virus challenges . Three drug treatments were given once daily , each to a different group of six rhesus macaques . Group 1 was treated subcutaneously with a human-equivalent dose of emtricitabine ( FTC ) , group 2 received orally the human-equivalent dosing of both FTC and tenofovir-disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) , and group 3 received subcutaneously a similar dosing of FTC and a higher dose of tenofovir . A fourth group of six rhesus macaques ( group 4 ) received intermittently a PrEP regimen similar to group 3 only 2 h before and 24 h after each weekly virus challenge . Results were compared to 18 control macaques that did not receive any drug treatment . The risk of infection in macaques treated in groups 1 and 2 was 3.8- and 7.8-fold lower than in untreated macaques ( p = 0.02 and p = 0.008 , respectively ) . All six macaques in group 3 were protected . Breakthrough infections had blunted acute viremias ; drug resistance was seen in two of six animals . All six animals in group 4 that received intermittent PrEP were protected . CONCLUSIONS This model suggests that single drugs for daily PrEP can be protective but a combination of antiretroviral drugs may be required to increase the level of protection . Short but potent intermittent PrEP can provide protection comparable to that of daily PrEP in this SHIV/macaque model . These findings support PrEP trials for HIV prevention in humans and identify promising PrEP modalities .

110,"CONTEXT More than 1.5 million US adults use stimulants and other medications labeled for treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) . These agents can increase heart rate and blood pressure , raising concerns about their cardiovascular safety . OBJECTIVE To examine whether current use of medications prescribed primarily to treat ADHD is associated with increased risk of serious cardiovascular events in young and middle-aged adults . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective , population-based cohort study using electronic health care records from 4 study sites ( OptumInsight Epidemiology , Tennessee Medicaid , Kaiser Permanente California , and the HMO Research Network ) , starting in 1986 at 1 site and ending in 2005 at all sites , with additional covariate assessment using 2007 survey data . Participants were adults aged 25 through 64 years with dispensed prescriptions for methylphenidate , amphetamine , or atomoxetine at baseline . Each medication user ( n = 150,359 ) was matched to 2 nonusers on study site , birth year , sex , and calendar year ( 443,198 total users and nonusers ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Serious cardiovascular events , including myocardial infarction ( MI ) , sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) , or stroke , with comparison between current or new users and remote users to account for potential healthy-user bias . RESULTS During 806,182 person-years of follow-up ( median , 1.3 years per person ) , 1357 cases of MI , 296 cases of SCD , and 575 cases of stroke occurred . There were 107,322 person-years of current use ( median , 0.33 years ) , with a crude incidence per 1000 person-years of 1.34 ( 95 % CI , 1.14 - 1.57 ) for MI , 0.30 ( 95 % CI , 0.20 - 0.42 ) for SCD , and 0.56 ( 95 % CI , 0.43 - 0.72 ) for stroke . The multivariable-adjusted rate ratio ( RR ) of serious cardiovascular events for current use vs nonuse of ADHD medications was 0.83 ( 95 % CI , 0.72 - 0.96 ) . Among new users of ADHD medications , the adjusted RR was 0.77 ( 95 % CI , 0.63 - 0.94 ) . The adjusted RR for current use vs remote use was 1.03 ( 95 % CI , 0.86 - 1.24 ) ; for new use vs remote use , the adjusted RR was 1.02 ( 95 % CI , 0.82 - 1.28 ) ; the upper limit of 1.28 corresponds to an additional 0.19 events per 1000 person-years at ages 25 - 44 years and 0.77 events per 1000 person-years at ages 45 - 64 years . CONCLUSIONS Among young and middle-aged adults , current or new use of ADHD medications , compared with nonuse or remote use , was not associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events . Apparent protective associations likely represent healthy-user bias .

113,"CONTEXT The epidemic of heart failure has yet to be fully investigated , and data on incidence , survival , and sex-specific temporal trends in community-based populations are limited . OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that the incidence of heart failure has declined and survival after heart failure diagnosis has improved over time but that secular trends have diverged by sex . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Population-based cohort study using the resources of the Rochester Epidemiology Project conducted in Olmsted County , Minnesota . Patients were 4537 Olmsted County residents ( 57 % women ; mean [ SD ] age , 74 [ 14 ] years ) with a diagnosis of heart failure between 1979 and 2000 . Framingham criteria and clinical criteria were used to validate the diagnosis MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Incidence of heart failure and survival after heart failure diagnosis . RESULTS The incidence of heart failure was higher among men ( 378/100 000 persons ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 361 - 395 for men ; 289/100 000 persons ; 95 % CI , 277 - 300 for women ) and did not change over time among men or women . After a mean follow-up of 4.2 years ( range , 0 - 23.8 years ) , 3347 deaths occurred , including 1930 among women and 1417 among men . Survival after heart failure diagnosis was worse among men than women ( relative risk , 1.33 ; 95 % CI , 1.24 - 1.43 ) but overall improved over time ( 5-year age-adjusted survival , 43 % in 1979 - 1984 vs 52 % in 1996 - 2000 , P<.001 ) . However , men and younger persons experienced larger survival gains , contrasting with less or no improvement for women and elderly persons .

114,"Importance Estimates from claims-based analyses suggest that the incidence of sepsis is increasing and mortality rates from sepsis are decreasing . However , estimates from claims data may lack clinical fidelity and can be affected by changing diagnosis and coding practices over time . Objective To estimate the US national incidence of sepsis and trends using detailed clinical data from the electronic health record ( EHR ) systems of diverse hospitals . Design , Setting , and Population Retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted to 409 academic , community , and federal hospitals from 2009 - 2014 . Exposures Sepsis was identified using clinical indicators of presumed infection and concurrent acute organ dysfunction , adapting Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock ( Sepsis-3 ) criteria for objective and consistent EHR-based surveillance . Main Outcomes and Measures Sepsis incidence , outcomes , and trends from 2009 - 2014 were calculated using regression models and compared with claims-based estimates using International Classification of Diseases , Ninth Revision , Clinical Modification codes for severe sepsis or septic shock . Case-finding criteria were validated against Sepsis-3 criteria using medical record reviews . Results A total of 173 690 sepsis cases ( mean age , 66.5 [ SD , 15.5 ] y ; 77 660 [ 42.4 % ] women ) were identified using clinical criteria among 2 901 019 adults admitted to study hospitals in 2014 ( 6.0 % incidence ) . Of these , 26 061 ( 15.0 % ) died in the hospital and 10 731 ( 6.2 % ) were discharged to hospice . From 2009 - 2014 , sepsis incidence using clinical criteria was stable ( + 0.6 % relative change/y [ 95 % CI , −2.3 % to 3.5 % ] , P = .67 ) whereas incidence per claims increased ( + 10.3%/y [ 95 % CI , 7.2 % to 13.3 % ] , P < .001 ) . In-hospital mortality using clinical criteria declined ( −3.3%/y [ 95 % CI , −5.6 % to −1.0 % ] , P = .004 ) , but there was no significant change in the combined outcome of death or discharge to hospice ( −1.3%/y [ 95 % CI , −3.2 % to 0.6 % ] , P = .19 ) . In contrast , mortality using claims declined significantly ( −7.0%/y [ 95 % CI , −8.8 % to −5.2 % ] , P < .001 ) , as did death or discharge to hospice ( −4.5%/y [ 95 % CI , −6.1 % to −2.8 % ] , P < .001 ) . Clinical criteria were more sensitive in identifying sepsis than claims ( 69.7 % [ 95 % CI , 52.9 % to 92.0 % ] vs 32.3 % [ 95 % CI , 24.4 % to 43.0 % ] , P < .001 ) , with comparable positive predictive value ( 70.4 % [ 95 % CI , 64.0 % to 76.8 % ] vs 75.2 % [ 95 % CI , 69.8 % to 80.6 % ] , P = .23 ) . Conclusions and Relevance In clinical data from 409 hospitals , sepsis was present in 6 % of adult hospitalizations , and in contrast to claims-based analyses , neither the incidence of sepsis nor the combined outcome of death or discharge to hospice changed significantly between 2009 - 2014 . The findings also suggest that EHR-based clinical data provide more objective estimates than claims-based data for sepsis surveillance .

115,"CONTEXT Pharmacist review of medication orders in the intensive care unit ( ICU ) has been shown to prevent errors , and pharmacist consultation has reduced drug costs . However , whether pharmacist participation in the ICU at the time of drug prescribing reduces adverse events has not been studied . OBJECTIVE To measure the effect of pharmacist participation on medical rounds in the ICU on the rate of preventable adverse drug events ( ADEs ) caused by ordering errors . DESIGN Before-after comparison between phase 1 ( baseline ) and phase 2 ( after intervention implemented ) and phase 2 comparison with a control unit that did not receive the intervention . SETTING A medical ICU ( study unit ) and a coronary care unit ( control unit ) in a large urban teaching hospital . PATIENTS Seventy-five patients randomly selected from each of 3 groups : all admissions to the study unit from February 1 , 1993 , through July 31 , 1993 ( baseline ) and all admissions to the study unit ( postintervention ) and control unit from October 1 , 1994 , through July 7 , 1995 . In addition , 50 patients were selected at random from the control unit during the baseline period . INTERVENTION A senior pharmacist made rounds with the ICU team and remained in the ICU for consultation in the morning , and was available on call throughout the day . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Preventable ADEs due to ordering ( prescribing ) errors and the number , type , and acceptance of interventions made by the pharmacist . Preventable ADEs were identified by review of medical records of the randomly selected patients during both preintervention and postintervention phases . Pharmacists recorded all recommendations , which were then analyzed by type and acceptance . RESULTS The rate of preventable ordering ADEs decreased by 66 % from 10.4 per 1000 patient-days ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 7 - 14 ) before the intervention to 3.5 ( 95 % CI , 1 - 5 ; P<.001 ) after the intervention . In the control unit , the rate was essentially unchanged during the same time periods : 10.9 ( 95 % CI , 6 - 16 ) and 12.4 ( 95 % CI , 8 - 17 ) per 1000 patient-days . The pharmacist made 366 recommendations related to drug ordering , of which 362 ( 99 % ) were accepted by physicians . CONCLUSIONS The presence of a pharmacist on rounds as a full member of the patient care team in a medical ICU was associated with a substantially lower rate of ADEs caused by prescribing errors . Nearly all the changes were readily accepted by physicians .

116,"BACKGROUND The associations of blood pressure with the different manifestations of incident cardiovascular disease in a contemporary population have not been compared . In this study , we aimed to analyse the associations of blood pressure with 12 different presentations of cardiovascular disease . METHODS We used linked electronic health records from 1997 to 2010 in the CALIBER ( CArdiovascular research using LInked Bespoke studies and Electronic health Records ) programme to assemble a cohort of 1·25 million patients , 30 years of age or older and initially free from cardiovascular disease , a fifth of whom received blood pressure-lowering treatments . We studied the heterogeneity in the age-specific associations of clinically measured blood pressure with 12 acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases , and estimated the lifetime risks ( up to 95 years of age ) and cardiovascular disease-free life-years lost adjusted for other risk factors at index ages 30 , 60 , and 80 years . This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01164371 . FINDINGS During 5·2 years median follow-up , we recorded 83,098 initial cardiovascular disease presentations . In each age group , the lowest risk for cardiovascular disease was in people with systolic blood pressure of 90 - 114 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of 60 - 74 mm Hg , with no evidence of a J-shaped increased risk at lower blood pressures . The effect of high blood pressure varied by cardiovascular disease endpoint , from strongly positive to no effect . Associations with high systolic blood pressure were strongest for intracerebral haemorrhage ( hazard ratio 1·44 [ 95 % CI 1·32 - 1·58 ] ) , subarachnoid haemorrhage ( 1·43 [ 1·25 - 1·63 ] ) , and stable angina ( 1·41 [ 1·36 - 1·46 ] ) , and weakest for abdominal aortic aneurysm ( 1·08 [ 1·00 - 1·17 ] ) . Compared with diastolic blood pressure , raised systolic blood pressure had a greater effect on angina , myocardial infarction , and peripheral arterial disease , whereas raised diastolic blood pressure had a greater effect on abdominal aortic aneurysm than did raised systolic pressure . Pulse pressure associations were inverse for abdominal aortic aneurysm ( HR per 10 mm Hg 0·91 [ 95 % CI 0·86 - 0·98 ] ) and strongest for peripheral arterial disease ( 1·23 [ 1·20 - 1·27 ] ) . People with hypertension ( blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg or those receiving blood pressure-lowering drugs ) had a lifetime risk of overall cardiovascular disease at 30 years of age of 63·3 % ( 95 % CI 62·9 - 63·8 ) compared with 46·1 % ( 45·5 - 46·8 ) for those with normal blood pressure , and developed cardiovascular disease 5·0 years earlier ( 95 % CI 4·8 - 5·2 ) . Stable and unstable angina accounted for most ( 43 % ) of the cardiovascular disease-free years of life lost associated with hypertension from index age 30 years , whereas heart failure and stable angina accounted for the largest proportion ( 19 % each ) of years of life lost from index age 80 years . INTERPRETATION The widely held assumptions that blood pressure has strong associations with the occurrence of all cardiovascular diseases across a wide age range , and that diastolic and systolic associations are concordant , are not supported by the findings of this high-resolution study . Despite modern treatments , the lifetime burden of hypertension is substantial . These findings emphasise the need for new blood pressure-lowering strategies , and will help to inform the design of randomised trials to assess them .

119,"CONTEXT Many observational studies have shown that physical activity reduces the risk of cognitive decline ; however , evidence from randomized trials is lacking . OBJECTIVE To determine whether physical activity reduces the rate of cognitive decline among older adults at risk . DESIGN AND SETTING Randomized controlled trial of a 24-week physical activity intervention conducted between 2004 and 2007 in metropolitan Perth , Western Australia . Assessors of cognitive function were blinded to group membership . PARTICIPANTS We recruited volunteers who reported memory problems but did not meet criteria for dementia . Three hundred eleven individuals aged 50 years or older were screened for eligibility , 89 were not eligible , and 52 refused to participate . A total of 170 participants were randomized and 138 participants completed the 18-month assessment . INTERVENTION Participants were randomly allocated to an education and usual care group or to a 24-week home-based program of physical activity . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Change in Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale ( ADAS-Cog ) scores ( possible range , 0 - 70 ) over 18 months . RESULTS In an intent-to-treat analysis , participants in the intervention group improved 0.26 points ( 95 % confidence interval , -0.89 to 0.54 ) and those in the usual care group deteriorated 1.04 points ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.32 to 1.82 ) on the ADAS-Cog at the end of the intervention . The absolute difference of the outcome measure between the intervention and control groups was -1.3 points ( 95 % confidence interval,-2.38 to -0.22 ) at the end of the intervention . At 18 months , participants in the intervention group improved 0.73 points ( 95 % confidence interval , -1.27 to 0.03 ) on the ADAS-Cog , and those in the usual care group improved 0.04 points ( 95 % confidence interval , -0.46 to 0.88 ) . Word list delayed recall and Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes improved modestly as well , whereas word list total immediate recall , digit symbol coding , verbal fluency , Beck depression score , and Medical Outcomes 36-Item Short-Form physical and mental component summaries did not change significantly . CONCLUSIONS In this study of adults with subjective memory impairment , a 6-month program of physical activity provided a modest improvement in cognition over an 18-month follow-up period .

120,"Podocyte dysfunction , represented by foot process effacement and proteinuria , is often the starting point for progressive kidney disease . Therapies aimed at the cellular level of the disease are currently not available . Here we show that induction of urokinase receptor ( uPAR ) signaling in podocytes leads to foot process effacement and urinary protein loss via a mechanism that includes lipid-dependent activation of αvβ3 integrin . Mice lacking uPAR ( Plaur−/− ) are protected from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated proteinuria but develop disease after expression of a constitutively active β3 integrin . Gene transfer studies reveal a prerequisite for uPAR expression in podocytes , but not in endothelial cells , for the development of LPS-mediated proteinuria . Mechanistically , uPAR is required to activate αvβ3 integrin in podocytes , promoting cell motility and activation of the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1 .

121,"ARID1A , encoding a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complex , is the most frequently mutated epigenetic regulator across all human cancers . ARID1A and TP53 mutations are typically mutually exclusive . Therapeutic approaches that correlate with this genetic characteristic remain to be explored . Here , we show that HDAC6 activity is essential in ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancers . Inhibition of HDAC6 activity using a clinically applicable small-molecule inhibitor significantly improved the survival of mice bearing ARID1A-mutated tumours . This correlated with the suppression of growth and dissemination of ARID1A-mutated , but not wild-type , tumours . The dependence on HDAC6 activity in ARID1A-mutated cells correlated with a direct transcriptional repression of HDAC6 by ARID1A . HDAC6 inhibition selectively promoted apoptosis of ARID1A-mutated cells . HDAC6 directly deacetylates Lys120 of p53 , a pro-apoptotic post-translational modification . Thus , ARID1A mutation inactivates the apoptosis-promoting function of p53 by upregulating HDAC6 .

122,"Exuberant fibroproliferation is a common complication after injury for reasons that are not well understood . One key component of wound repair that is often overlooked is mechanical force , which regulates cell-matrix interactions through intracellular focal adhesion components , including focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) . Here we report that FAK is activated after cutaneous injury and that this process is potentiated by mechanical loading . Fibroblast-specific FAK knockout mice have substantially less inflammation and fibrosis than control mice in a model of hypertrophic scar formation . We show that FAK acts through extracellular-related kinase ( ERK ) to mechanically trigger the secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP-1 , also known as CCL2 ) , a potent chemokine that is linked to human fibrotic disorders . Similarly , MCP-1 knockout mice form minimal scars , indicating that inflammatory chemokine pathways are a major mechanism by which FAK mechanotransduction induces fibrosis .

123,"Exuberant fibroproliferation is a common complication after injury for reasons that are not well understood . One key component of wound repair that is often overlooked is mechanical force , which regulates cell-matrix interactions through intracellular focal adhesion components , including focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) . Here we report that FAK is activated after cutaneous injury and that this process is potentiated by mechanical loading . Fibroblast-specific FAK knockout mice have substantially less inflammation and fibrosis than control mice in a model of hypertrophic scar formation . We show that FAK acts through extracellular-related kinase ( ERK ) to mechanically trigger the secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP-1 , also known as CCL2 ) , a potent chemokine that is linked to human fibrotic disorders . Similarly , MCP-1 knockout mice form minimal scars , indicating that inflammatory chemokine pathways are a major mechanism by which FAK mechanotransduction induces fibrosis .

We demonstrated that JMJD6 acts as an α-ketoglutarate- and Fe(II)-dependent lysyl hydroxylase to catalyze p53 hydroxylation . We found that p53 indeed exists as a hydroxylated protein in vivo and that the hydroxylation occurs mainly on lysine 382 of p53 .

These unidentified SMC-derived cells exhibit phenotypes of other cell lineages , including macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) . SMC-specific conditional knockout of Krüppel-like factor 4 ( Klf4 ) resulted in reduced numbers of SMC-derived MSC- and macrophage-like cells , a marked reduction in lesion size , and increases in multiple indices of plaque stability , including an increase in fibrous cap thickness as compared to wild-type controls .

Thus , our in vivo loss-of-function studies demonstrate that KLF4 , previously shown to mediate proinflammatory signaling in human macrophages in vitro , is essential for differentiation of mouse inflammatory monocytes , and is involved in the differentiation of resident monocytes . In addition , inducible expression of KLF4 in the HL60 human acute myeloid leukemia cell line stimulated monocytic differentiation and enhanced 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate induced macrophage differentiation , but blocked all-trans-retinoic acid induced granulocytic differentiation of HL60 cells . The inflammation-selective effects of loss-of-KLF4 and the gain-of-KLF4-induced monocytic differentiation in HL60 cells identify KLF4 as a key regulator of monocytic differentiation and a potential target for translational immune modulation .

130,"BACKGROUND LDL cholesterol has a causal role in the development of cardiovascular disease . Improved understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie the metabolism and regulation of LDL cholesterol might help to identify novel therapeutic targets . We therefore did a genome-wide association study of LDL-cholesterol concentrations . METHODS We used genome-wide association data from up to 11,685 participants with measures of circulating LDL-cholesterol concentrations across five studies , including data for 293 461 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) with a minor allele frequency of 5 % or more that passed our quality control criteria . We also used data from a second genome-wide array in up to 4337 participants from three of these five studies , with data for 290,140 SNPs . We did replication studies in two independent populations consisting of up to 4979 participants . Statistical approaches , including meta-analysis and linkage disequilibrium plots , were used to refine association signals ; we analysed pooled data from all seven populations to determine the effect of each SNP on variations in circulating LDL-cholesterol concentrations . FINDINGS In our initial scan , we found two SNPs ( rs599839 [ p=1.7x10(-15 ) ] and rs4970834 [ p=3.0x10(-11 ) ] ) that showed genome-wide statistical association with LDL cholesterol at chromosomal locus 1p13.3 . The second genome screen found a third statistically associated SNP at the same locus ( rs646776 [ p=4.3x10(-9 ) ] ) . Meta-analysis of data from all studies showed an association of SNPs rs599839 ( combined p=1.2x10(-33 ) ) and rs646776 ( p=4.8x10(-20 ) ) with LDL-cholesterol concentrations . SNPs rs599839 and rs646776 both explained around 1 % of the variation in circulating LDL-cholesterol concentrations and were associated with about 15 % of an SD change in LDL cholesterol per allele , assuming an SD of 1 mmol/L.

136,"Blood monocytes are well-characterized precursors for macrophages and dendritic cells . Subsets of human monocytes with differential representation in various disease states are well known . In contrast , mouse monocyte subsets have been characterized minimally . In this study we identify three subpopulations of mouse monocytes that can be distinguished by differential expression of Ly-6C , CD43 , CD11c , MBR , and CD62L . The subsets share the characteristics of extensive phagocytosis , similar expression of M-CSF receptor ( CD115 ) , and development into macrophages upon M-CSF stimulation . By eliminating blood monocytes with dichloromethylene-bisphosphonate-loaded liposomes and monitoring their repopulation , we showed a developmental relationship between the subsets . Monocytes were maximally depleted 18 h after liposome application and subsequently reappeared in the circulation . These cells were exclusively of the Ly-6C(high ) subset , resembling bone marrow monocytes . Serial flow cytometric analyses of newly released Ly-6C(high ) monocytes showed that Ly-6C expression on these cells was down-regulated while in circulation . Under inflammatory conditions elicited either by acute infection with Listeria monocytogenes or chronic infection with Leishmania major , there was a significant increase in immature Ly-6C(high ) monocytes , resembling the inflammatory left shift of granulocytes .

137,"Somatic mutations that activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3 K ) have been identified in the p110-alpha catalytic subunit ( encoded by PIK3CA ) . They are most frequently observed in two hotspots : the helical domain ( E545 K and E542 K ) and the kinase domain ( H1047R ) . Although the p110-alpha mutants are transforming in vitro , their oncogenic potential has not been assessed in genetically engineered mouse models . Furthermore , clinical trials with PI3 K inhibitors have recently been initiated , and it is unknown if their efficacy will be restricted to specific , genetically defined malignancies . In this study , we engineered a mouse model of lung adenocarcinomas initiated and maintained by expression of p110-alpha H1047R . Treatment of these tumors with NVP-BEZ235 , a dual pan-PI3 K and mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibitor in clinical development , led to marked tumor regression as shown by positron emission tomography-computed tomography , magnetic resonance imaging and microscopic examination . In contrast , mouse lung cancers driven by mutant Kras did not substantially respond to single-agent NVP-BEZ235 . However , when NVP-BEZ235 was combined with a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( MEK ) inhibitor , ARRY-142886 , there was marked synergy in shrinking these Kras-mutant cancers . These in vivo studies suggest that inhibitors of the PI3K-mTOR pathway may be active in cancers with PIK3CA mutations and , when combined with MEK inhibitors , may effectively treat KRAS mutated lung cancers .

DATA SOURCES Medline , Embase , the Cochrane controlled trials register , the Current Science meta-register of controlled trials , and reference lists of identified articles . All data sources were searched from December 2002 ( end date of last search ) to December 2006 . STUDIES REVIEWED Double blind randomised placebo controlled trials of approved anti-obesity drugs used in adults ( age over 18 ) for one year or longer . RESULTS 30 trials of one to four years ' duration met the inclusion criteria : 16 orlistat ( n=10 631 participants ) , 10 sibutramine ( n=2623 ) , and four rimonabant ( n=6365 ) . Of these , 14 trials were new and 16 had previously been identified . Attrition rates averaged 30 - 40 % . Compared with placebo , orlistat reduced weight by 2.9 kg ( 95 % confidence interval 2.5 kg to 3.2 kg ) , sibutramine by 4.2 kg ( 3.6 kg to 4.7 kg ) , and rimonabant by 4.7 kg ( 4.1 kg to 5.3 kg ) . Patients receiving active drug treatment were significantly more likely to achieve 5 % and 10 % weight loss thresholds . Orlistat reduced the incidence of diabetes and improved concentrations of total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol , blood pressure , and glycaemic control in patients with diabetes but increased rates of gastrointestinal side effects and slightly lowered concentrations of high density lipoprotein . Sibutramine improved [ corrected ] concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides [ corrected ] Rimonabant improved concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides , blood pressure , and glycaemic control in patients with diabetes but increased the risk of mood disorders .

OBJECTIVE To investigate the role of gender among hospitalized patients treated for infection . DESIGN Observational cohort study conducted during a 26-month period from December 1996 through January 1999 . SETTING University-affiliated hospital . PARTICIPANTS A total of 892 patients in the surgical units of the hospital with 1470 consecutive infectious episodes ( 782 in men and 688 in women ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Mortality during hospitalization by gender for infection episodes overall and for specific infectious sites , including lung , peritoneum , bloodstream , catheter , urine , surgical site , and skin/soft tissue . RESULTS Among all infections , there was no significant difference in mortality based on gender ( men , 11.1 % vs women , 14.2 % ; P = .07 ) . After logistic regression analysis , factors independently associated with mortality included higher APACHE ( Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation ) II score , older age , malignancy , blood transfusion , and diagnosis of infection more than 7 days after admission , but not gender ( female odds ratio [ OR ] for death , 1.32 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.90 - 1.94 ; P = .16 ) .

143,"BACKGROUND Elderly and frail patients with cancer , although often treated with chemotherapy , are under-represented in clinical trials . We designed FOCUS2 to investigate reduced-dose chemotherapy options and to seek objective predictors of outcome in frail patients with advanced colorectal cancer . METHODS We undertook an open , 2 × 2 factorial trial in 61 UK centres for patients with previously untreated advanced colorectal cancer who were considered unfit for full-dose chemotherapy . After comprehensive health assessment ( CHA ) , patients were randomly assigned by minimisation to : 48-h intravenous fluorouracil with levofolinate ( group A ) ; oxaliplatin and fluorouracil ( group B ) ; capecitabine ( group C ) ; or oxaliplatin and capecitabine ( group D ) . Treatment allocation was not masked . Starting doses were 80 % of standard doses , with discretionary escalation to full dose after 6 weeks . The two primary outcome measures were : addition of oxaliplatin ( [ A vs B ] + [ C vs D ] ) , assessed with progression-free survival ( PFS ) ; and substitution of fluorouracil with capecitabine ( [ A vs C ] + [ B vs D ] ) , assessed by change from baseline to 12 weeks in global quality of life ( QoL ) . Analysis was by intention to treat . Baseline clinical and CHA data were modelled against outcomes with a novel composite measure , overall treatment utility ( OTU ) . This study is registered , number ISRCTN21221452 . FINDINGS 459 patients were randomly assigned ( 115 to each of groups A-C , 114 to group D ) . Factorial comparison of addition of oxaliplatin versus no addition suggested some improvement in PFS , but the finding was not significant ( median 5·8 months [ IQR 3·3 - 7·5 ] vs 4·5 months [ 2·8 - 6·4 ] ; hazard ratio 0·84 , 95 % CI 0·69 - 1·01 , p=0·07 ) . Replacement of fluorouracil with capecitabine did not improve global QoL : 69 of 124 ( 56 % ) patients receiving fluorouracil reported improvement in global QoL compared with 69 of 123 ( 56 % ) receiving capecitabine . The risk of having any grade 3 or worse toxic effect was not significantly increased with oxaliplatin ( 83/219 [ 38 % ] vs 70/221 [ 32 % ] ; p=0·17 ) , but was higher with capecitabine than with fluorouracil ( 88/222 [ 40 % ] vs 65/218 [ 30 % ] ; p=0·03 ) . In multivariable analysis , fewer baseline symptoms ( odds ratio 1·32 , 95 % CI 1·14 - 1·52 ) , less widespread disease ( 1·51 , 1·05 - 2·19 ) , and use of oxaliplatin ( 0·57 , 0·39 - 0·82 ) were predictive of better OTU .

144,"Traditionally , vaccine development involves tradeoffs between immunogenicity and safety . Live-attenuated vaccines typically offer rapid and durable immunity but have reduced safety when compared to inactivated vaccines . In contrast , the inability of inactivated vaccines to replicate enhances safety at the expense of immunogenicity , often necessitating multiple doses and boosters . To overcome these tradeoffs , we developed the insect-specific alphavirus , Eilat virus ( EILV ) , as a vaccine platform . To address the chikungunya fever ( CHIKF ) pandemic , we used an EILV cDNA clone to design a chimeric virus containing the chikungunya virus ( CHIKV ) structural proteins . The recombinant EILV/CHIKV was structurally identical at 10 Å to wild-type CHIKV , as determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy , and it mimicked the early stages of CHIKV replication in vertebrate cells from attachment and entry to viral RNA delivery . Yet the recombinant virus remained completely defective for productive replication , providing a high degree of safety . A single dose of EILV/CHIKV produced in mosquito cells elicited rapid ( within 4 d ) and long-lasting ( > 290 d ) neutralizing antibodies that provided complete protection in two different mouse models . In nonhuman primates , EILV/CHIKV elicited rapid and robust immunity that protected against viremia and telemetrically monitored fever . Our EILV platform represents the first structurally native application of an insect-specific virus in preclinical vaccine development and highlights the potential application of such viruses in vaccinology .

Here , we show that mice lacking SIRT1 in steroidogenic factor 1 ( SF1 ) neurons are hypersensitive to dietary obesity owing to maladaptive energy expenditure . Also , mutant mice have increased susceptibility to developing dietary T2DM due to insulin resistance in skeletal muscle . Mechanistically , these aberrations arise , in part , from impaired metabolic actions of the neuropeptide orexin-A and the hormone leptin .

146,"BACKGROUND Interleukin (IL)-12 exerts a potent proinflammatory effect by stimulating T-helper ( Th ) 1 responses . This effect is believed to be mediated primarily through the activation of STAT4 and subsequent production of interferon (IFN)-gamma . Methods and Results- We examined the role of IL-12 receptor ( IL-12R ) signaling in the development of murine experimental autoimmune myocarditis ( EAM ) induced by cardiac myosin immunization . Both IL-12Rbeta1-deficient mice and STAT4-deficient mice were resistant to the induction of myocarditis . Treatment with exogenous IL-12 exacerbated disease . We questioned whether IFN-gamma is required for the disease-promoting activity of IL-12 . On the contrary , we found that IFN-gamma suppresses EAM . Lack of IFN-gamma due to either depletion with an antibody or a genetic deficiency exacerbated myocarditis . Spleens from IFN-gamma-deficient mice immunized with cardiac myosin showed increased cellularity ; greater numbers of CD3 + , CD4 + , CD8 + , and IL-2-producing cells ; and heightened ability to produce cytokines on stimulation in vitro . Treatment of mice with recombinant IFN-gamma suppressed the development of myocarditis . CONCLUSIONS IL-12/IL-12R/STAT4 signaling promotes the development of EAM . In contrast , IFN-gamma plays a protective role . The disease-limiting effects of IFN-gamma might be explained by its ability to control the expansion of activated T lymphocytes .

We show that leading-strand initiation preferentially occurs within a nucleosome-free region at replication origins . Using a strain in which late origins can be induced to fire early , we show that replication termination is a largely passive phenomenon that does not rely on cis-acting sequences or replication fork pausing .

157,"BACKGROUND Genetic and epidemiological evidence suggests an inverse association between B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) levels in blood and risk of type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) , but the prospective association of BNP with T2D is uncertain , and it is unclear whether the association is confounded . METHODS AND FINDINGS We analysed the association between levels of the N-terminal fragment of pro-BNP ( NT-pro-BNP ) in blood and risk of incident T2D in a prospective case-cohort study and genotyped the variant rs198389 within the BNP locus in three T2D case-control studies . We combined our results with existing data in a meta-analysis of 11 case-control studies . Using a Mendelian randomization approach , we compared the observed association between rs198389 and T2D to that expected from the NT-pro-BNP level to T2D association and the NT-pro-BNP difference per C allele of rs198389 . In participants of our case-cohort study who were free of T2D and cardiovascular disease at baseline , we observed a 21 % ( 95 % CI 3%-36 % ) decreased risk of incident T2D per one standard deviation ( SD ) higher log-transformed NT-pro-BNP levels in analysis adjusted for age , sex , body mass index , systolic blood pressure , smoking , family history of T2D , history of hypertension , and levels of triglycerides , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol , and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol . The association between rs198389 and T2D observed in case-control studies ( odds ratio = 0.94 per C allele , 95 % CI 0.91 - 0.97 ) was similar to that expected ( 0.96 , 0.93 - 0.98 ) based on the pooled estimate for the log-NT-pro-BNP level to T2D association derived from a meta-analysis of our study and published data ( hazard ratio = 0.82 per SD , 0.74 - 0.90 ) and the difference in NT-pro-BNP levels ( 0.22 SD , 0.15 - 0.29 ) per C allele of rs198389 . No significant associations were observed between the rs198389 genotype and potential confounders .

159,"Traditionally , vaccine development involves tradeoffs between immunogenicity and safety . Live-attenuated vaccines typically offer rapid and durable immunity but have reduced safety when compared to inactivated vaccines . In contrast , the inability of inactivated vaccines to replicate enhances safety at the expense of immunogenicity , often necessitating multiple doses and boosters . To overcome these tradeoffs , we developed the insect-specific alphavirus , Eilat virus ( EILV ) , as a vaccine platform . To address the chikungunya fever ( CHIKF ) pandemic , we used an EILV cDNA clone to design a chimeric virus containing the chikungunya virus ( CHIKV ) structural proteins . The recombinant EILV/CHIKV was structurally identical at 10 Å to wild-type CHIKV , as determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy , and it mimicked the early stages of CHIKV replication in vertebrate cells from attachment and entry to viral RNA delivery . Yet the recombinant virus remained completely defective for productive replication , providing a high degree of safety . A single dose of EILV/CHIKV produced in mosquito cells elicited rapid ( within 4 d ) and long-lasting ( > 290 d ) neutralizing antibodies that provided complete protection in two different mouse models .

160,"CONTEXT The long-term risk for developing hypertension is best described by the lifetime risk statistic . The lifetime risk for hypertension and trends in this risk over time are unknown . OBJECTIVES To estimate the residual lifetime risk for hypertension in older US adults and to evaluate temporal trends in this risk . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Community-based prospective cohort study of 1298 participants from the Framingham Heart Study who were aged 55 to 65 years and free of hypertension at baseline ( 1976 - 1998 ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Residual lifetime risk ( lifetime cumulative incidence not adjusted for competing causes of mortality ) for hypertension , defined as blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or greater or use of antihypertensive medications . RESULTS The residual lifetime risks for developing hypertension and stage 1 high blood pressure or higher ( greater-than-or-equal to 140/90 mm Hg regardless of treatment ) were 90 % in both 55- and 65-year-old participants . The lifetime probability of receiving antihypertensive medication was 60 % . The risk for hypertension remained unchanged for women , but it was approximately 60 % higher for men in the contemporary 1976 - 1998 period compared with an earlier 1952 - 1975 period . In contrast , the residual lifetime risk for stage 2 high blood pressure or higher ( greater-than-or-equal to 160/100 mm Hg regardless of treatment ) was considerably lower in both sexes in the recent period ( 35%-57 % in 1952 - 1975 vs 35%-44 % in 1976 - 1998 ) , likely due to a marked increase in treatment of individuals with substantially elevated blood pressure . CONCLUSION The residual lifetime risk for hypertension for middle-aged and elderly individuals is 90 % , indicating a huge public health burden . Although the decline in lifetime risk for stage 2 high blood pressure or higher represents a major achievement , efforts should be directed at the primary prevention of hypertension .

164,"Background Celiac disease is a small intestinal inflammatory disorder characterized by malabsorption , nutrient deficiency , and a range of clinical manifestations . It is caused by an inappropriate immune response to dietary gluten and is treated with a gluten-free diet . Recent feeding studies have indicated oats to be safe for celiac disease patients , and oats are now often included in the celiac disease diet . This study aimed to investigate whether oat intolerance exists in celiac disease and to characterize the cells and processes underlying this intolerance . Methods and Findings We selected for study nine adults with celiac disease who had a history of oats exposure . Four of the patients had clinical symptoms on an oats-containing diet , and three of these four patients had intestinal inflammation typical of celiac disease at the time of oats exposure . We established oats-avenin-specific and -reactive intestinal T-cell lines from these three patients , as well as from two other patients who appeared to tolerate oats . The avenin-reactive T-cell lines recognized avenin peptides in the context of HLA-DQ2 . These peptides have sequences rich in proline and glutamine residues closely resembling wheat gluten epitopes . Deamidation ( glutamine→glutamic acid conversion ) by tissue transglutaminase was involved in the avenin epitope formation . Conclusions We conclude that some celiac disease patients have avenin-reactive mucosal T-cells that can cause mucosal inflammation . Oat intolerance may be a reason for villous atrophy and inflammation in patients with celiac disease who are eating oats but otherwise are adhering to a strict gluten-free diet . Clinical follow-up of celiac disease patients eating oats is advisable .

We demonstrate here that metabolism by intestinal microbiota of dietary L-carnitine , a trimethylamine abundant in red meat , also produces TMAO and accelerates atherosclerosis in mice . Omnivorous human subjects produced more TMAO than did vegans or vegetarians following ingestion of L-carnitine through a microbiota-dependent mechanism . The presence of specific bacterial taxa in human feces was associated with both plasma TMAO concentration and dietary status . Plasma L-carnitine levels in subjects undergoing cardiac evaluation ( n = 2,595 ) predicted increased risks for both prevalent cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) and incident major adverse cardiac events ( myocardial infarction , stroke or death ) , but only among subjects with concurrently high TMAO levels . Chronic dietary L-carnitine supplementation in mice altered cecal microbial composition , markedly enhanced synthesis of TMA and TMAO , and increased atherosclerosis , but this did not occur if intestinal microbiota was concurrently suppressed . In mice with an intact intestinal microbiota , dietary supplementation with TMAO or either carnitine or choline reduced in vivo reverse cholesterol transport .

167,"BACKGROUND Alirocumab , a monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 ( PCSK9 ) , lowers plasma low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol and apolipoprotein B100 ( apoB ) . Although studies in mice and cells have identified increased hepatic LDL receptors as the basis for LDL lowering by PCSK9 inhibitors , there have been no human studies characterizing the effects of PCSK9 inhibitors on lipoprotein metabolism . In particular , it is not known whether inhibition of PCSK9 has any effects on very low-density lipoprotein or intermediate-density lipoprotein ( IDL ) metabolism . Inhibition of PCSK9 also results in reductions of plasma lipoprotein ( a ) levels . The regulation of plasma Lp(a ) levels , including the role of LDL receptors in the clearance of Lp(a ) , is poorly defined , and no mechanistic studies of the Lp(a ) lowering by alirocumab in humans have been published to date . METHODS Eighteen ( 10 F , 8 mol/L ) participants completed a placebo-controlled , 2-period study . They received 2 doses of placebo , 2 weeks apart , followed by 5 doses of 150 mg of alirocumab , 2 weeks apart . At the end of each period , fractional clearance rates ( FCRs ) and production rates ( PRs ) of apoB and apo(a ) were determined . In 10 participants , postprandial triglycerides and apoB48 levels were measured . RESULTS Alirocumab reduced ultracentrifugally isolated LDL-C by 55.1 % , LDL-apoB by 56.3 % , and plasma Lp(a ) by 18.7 % . The fall in LDL-apoB was caused by an 80.4 % increase in LDL-apoB FCR and a 23.9 % reduction in LDL-apoB PR . The latter was due to a 46.1 % increase in IDL-apoB FCR coupled with a 27.2 % decrease in conversion of IDL to LDL . The FCR of apo(a ) tended to increase ( 24.6 % ) without any change in apo(a ) PR . Alirocumab had no effects on FCRs or PRs of very low-density lipoproteins-apoB and very low-density lipoproteins triglycerides or on postprandial plasma triglycerides or apoB48 concentrations . CONCLUSIONS Alirocumab decreased LDL-C and LDL-apoB by increasing IDL- and LDL-apoB FCRs and decreasing LDL-apoB PR . These results are consistent with increases in LDL receptors available to clear IDL and LDL from blood during PCSK9 inhibition .

Programmed death-1 ( PD-1 ) and interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) are both upregulated during HIV infection . Blocking interactions between PD-1 and programmed death ligand-1 ( PD-L1 ) and between IL-10 and IL-10 receptor ( IL-10R ) results in viral clearance and improves T cell function in animal models of chronic viral infections . Here we show that high amounts of microbial products and inflammatory cytokines in the plasma of HIV-infected subjects lead to upregulation of PD-1 expression on monocytes that correlates with high plasma concentrations of IL-10 . Triggering of PD-1 expressed on monocytes by PD-L1 expressed on various cell types induced IL-10 production and led to reversible CD4 + T cell dysfunction . We describe a new function for PD-1 whereby microbial products inhibit T cell expansion and function by upregulating PD-1 levels and IL-10 production by monocytes after binding of PD-1 by PD-L1 .

173,"CONTEXT Many smokers are unable or unwilling to completely quit smoking . A proposed means of harm reduction is to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked per day . However , it is not clear whether this strategy decreases the risk for tobacco-related diseases . OBJECTIVE To assess the effects of smoking reduction on lung cancer incidence . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Observational population-based cohort study with up to 31 years of follow-up from the Copenhagen Centre for Prospective Population Studies , which administrates data from 3 longitudinal studies conducted in Copenhagen and suburbs , the Copenhagen City Heart Study , the Copenhagen Male Study , and the Glostrup Population Studies , Denmark . Participants were 11,151 men and 8563 women ( N = 19,714 ) aged 20 to 93 years , who attended 2 consecutive examinations with a 5- to 10-year interval between 1964 and 1988 . Participants underwent a physical examination and completed self-filled questionnaires about lifestyle habits . The study population was divided into 6 groups according to smoking habits : continued heavy smokers ( > or = 15 cigarettes/d ) , reducers ( reduced from > or = 15 cigarettes/d by minimum of 50 % without quitting ) , continued light smokers ( 1 - 14 cigarettes/d ) , quitters ( stopped between first and second examination ) , stable ex-smokers , and never smokers . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Incident primary lung cancer cases assessed by record linkage with the National Cancer Registry until December 31 , 2003 . RESULTS There were 864 incident lung cancers during follow-up . Using Cox regression , the adjusted hazard ratio ( HR ) for lung cancer in reducers was 0.73 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.54 - 0.98 ) compared with persistent heavy smokers .

174,"OBJECTIVES To explore the association between a stable partnership and clinical outcome in HIV infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) . DESIGN Prospective cohort study of adults with HIV ( Swiss HIV cohort study ) . SETTING Seven outpatient clinics throughout Switzerland . PARTICIPANTS The 3736 patients in the cohort who started HAART before 2002 ( median age 36 years , 29 % female , median follow up 3.6 years ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Time to AIDS or death ( primary endpoint ) , death alone , increases in CD4 cell count of at least 50 and 100 above baseline , optimal viral suppression ( a viral load below 400 copies/ml ) , and viral rebound . RESULTS During follow up 2985 ( 80 % ) participants reported a stable partnership on at least one occasion . When starting HAART , 52 % ( 545/1042 ) of participants reported a stable partnership ; after five years of follow up 46 % ( 190/412 ) of participants reported a stable partnership . In an analysis stratified by previous antiretroviral therapy and clinical stage when starting HAART ( US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention group A , B , or C ) , the adjusted hazard ratio for progression to AIDS or death was 0.79 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.63 to 0.98 ) for participants with a stable partnership compared with those without . Adjusted hazards ratios for other endpoints were 0.59 ( 0.44 to 0.79 ) for progression to death , 1.15 ( 1.06 to 1.24 ) for an increase in CD4 cells of 100 counts/microl or more , and 1.06 ( 0.98 to 1.14 ) for optimal viral suppression .

175,"BACKGROUND The heritable haemoglobinopathy alpha(+)-thalassaemia is caused by the reduced synthesis of alpha-globin chains that form part of normal adult haemoglobin ( Hb ) . Individuals homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia have microcytosis and an increased erythrocyte count . Alpha(+)-thalassaemia homozygosity confers considerable protection against severe malaria , including severe malarial anaemia ( SMA ) ( Hb concentration < 50 g/l ) , but does not influence parasite count . We tested the hypothesis that the erythrocyte indices associated with alpha(+)-thalassaemia homozygosity provide a haematological benefit during acute malaria . METHODS AND FINDINGS Data from children living on the north coast of Papua New Guinea who had participated in a case-control study of the protection afforded by alpha(+)-thalassaemia against severe malaria were reanalysed to assess the genotype-specific reduction in erythrocyte count and Hb levels associated with acute malarial disease . We observed a reduction in median erythrocyte count of approximately 1.5 x 10(12)/l in all children with acute falciparum malaria relative to values in community children ( p < 0.001 ) . We developed a simple mathematical model of the linear relationship between Hb concentration and erythrocyte count . This model predicted that children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia lose less Hb than children of normal genotype for a reduction in erythrocyte count of > 1.1 x 10(12)/l as a result of the reduced mean cell Hb in homozygous alpha(+)-thalassaemia . In addition , children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia require a 10 % greater reduction in erythrocyte count than children of normal genotype ( p = 0.02 ) for Hb concentration to fall to 50 g/l , the cutoff for SMA . We estimated that the haematological profile in children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia reduces the risk of SMA during acute malaria compared to children of normal genotype ( relative risk 0.52 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.24 - 1.12 , p = 0.09 ) . CONCLUSIONS The increased erythrocyte count and microcytosis in children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia may contribute substantially to their protection against SMA . A lower concentration of Hb per erythrocyte and a larger population of erythrocytes may be a biologically advantageous strategy against the significant reduction in erythrocyte count that occurs during acute infection with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum . This haematological profile may reduce the risk of anaemia by other Plasmodium species , as well as other causes of anaemia . Other host polymorphisms that induce an increased erythrocyte count and microcytosis may confer a similar advantage .

176,"Panic disorder is a severe anxiety disorder with recurrent , debilitating panic attacks . In individuals with panic disorder there is evidence of decreased central gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) activity as well as marked increases in autonomic and respiratory responses after intravenous infusions of hypertonic sodium lactate . In a rat model of panic disorder , chronic inhibition of GABA synthesis in the dorsomedial-perifornical hypothalamus of rats produces anxiety-like states and a similar vulnerability to sodium lactate-induced cardioexcitatory responses . The dorsomedial-perifornical hypothalamus is enriched in neurons containing orexin ( ORX , also known as hypocretin ) , which have a crucial role in arousal , vigilance and central autonomic mobilization , all of which are key components of panic . Here we show that activation of ORX-synthesizing neurons is necessary for developing a panic-prone state in the rat panic model , and either silencing of the hypothalamic gene encoding ORX ( Hcrt ) with RNAi or systemic ORX-1 receptor antagonists blocks the panic responses . Moreover , we show that human subjects with panic anxiety have elevated levels of ORX in the cerebrospinal fluid compared to subjects without panic anxiety . Taken together , our results suggest that the ORX system may be involved in the pathophysiology of panic anxiety and that ORX antagonists constitute a potential new treatment strategy for panic disorder .

INTERVENTION Patients were randomly assigned to receive INO ( 80 ppm with 21 % final concentration of inspired oxygen ; n = 10 ) , or placebo ( 21 % inspired oxygen ; n = 10 ) for 4 hours . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Change in pain at 4 hours of inhalation compared with preinhalation pain , measured on a 10-cm visual analog scale ( VAS ) ; secondary outcome measures were pain over 6 hours , parenteral narcotic use over 24 hours , duration of hospitalization , blood pressure , oxygen saturation , and methemoglobin concentration . RESULTS Preinhalation VAS pain scores were similar in the INO and placebo groups ( P = .80 ) . The decrease in VAS pain scores at 4 hours was 2.0 cm in the INO group and 1.2 cm in the placebo group ( P = .37 ) .

178,"CONTEXT Pharmacist review of medication orders in the intensive care unit ( ICU ) has been shown to prevent errors , and pharmacist consultation has reduced drug costs . However , whether pharmacist participation in the ICU at the time of drug prescribing reduces adverse events has not been studied . OBJECTIVE To measure the effect of pharmacist participation on medical rounds in the ICU on the rate of preventable adverse drug events ( ADEs ) caused by ordering errors . DESIGN Before-after comparison between phase 1 ( baseline ) and phase 2 ( after intervention implemented ) and phase 2 comparison with a control unit that did not receive the intervention . SETTING A medical ICU ( study unit ) and a coronary care unit ( control unit ) in a large urban teaching hospital . PATIENTS Seventy-five patients randomly selected from each of 3 groups : all admissions to the study unit from February 1 , 1993 , through July 31 , 1993 ( baseline ) and all admissions to the study unit ( postintervention ) and control unit from October 1 , 1994 , through July 7 , 1995 . In addition , 50 patients were selected at random from the control unit during the baseline period . INTERVENTION A senior pharmacist made rounds with the ICU team and remained in the ICU for consultation in the morning , and was available on call throughout the day . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Preventable ADEs due to ordering ( prescribing ) errors and the number , type , and acceptance of interventions made by the pharmacist . Preventable ADEs were identified by review of medical records of the randomly selected patients during both preintervention and postintervention phases . Pharmacists recorded all recommendations , which were then analyzed by type and acceptance . RESULTS The rate of preventable ordering ADEs decreased by 66 % from 10.4 per 1000 patient-days ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 7 - 14 ) before the intervention to 3.5 ( 95 % CI , 1 - 5 ; P<.001 ) after the intervention . In the control unit , the rate was essentially unchanged during the same time periods : 10.9 ( 95 % CI , 6 - 16 ) and 12.4 ( 95 % CI , 8 - 17 ) per 1000 patient-days . The pharmacist made 366 recommendations related to drug ordering , of which 362 ( 99 % ) were accepted by physicians .

179,"CONTEXT Many observational studies have shown that physical activity reduces the risk of cognitive decline ; however , evidence from randomized trials is lacking . OBJECTIVE To determine whether physical activity reduces the rate of cognitive decline among older adults at risk . DESIGN AND SETTING Randomized controlled trial of a 24-week physical activity intervention conducted between 2004 and 2007 in metropolitan Perth , Western Australia . Assessors of cognitive function were blinded to group membership . PARTICIPANTS We recruited volunteers who reported memory problems but did not meet criteria for dementia . Three hundred eleven individuals aged 50 years or older were screened for eligibility , 89 were not eligible , and 52 refused to participate . A total of 170 participants were randomized and 138 participants completed the 18-month assessment . INTERVENTION Participants were randomly allocated to an education and usual care group or to a 24-week home-based program of physical activity . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Change in Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale ( ADAS-Cog ) scores ( possible range , 0 - 70 ) over 18 months . RESULTS In an intent-to-treat analysis , participants in the intervention group improved 0.26 points ( 95 % confidence interval , -0.89 to 0.54 ) and those in the usual care group deteriorated 1.04 points ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.32 to 1.82 ) on the ADAS-Cog at the end of the intervention . The absolute difference of the outcome measure between the intervention and control groups was -1.3 points ( 95 % confidence interval,-2.38 to -0.22 ) at the end of the intervention . At 18 months , participants in the intervention group improved 0.73 points ( 95 % confidence interval , -1.27 to 0.03 ) on the ADAS-Cog , and those in the usual care group improved 0.04 points ( 95 % confidence interval , -0.46 to 0.88 ) . Word list delayed recall and Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes improved modestly as well , whereas word list total immediate recall , digit symbol coding , verbal fluency , Beck depression score , and Medical Outcomes 36-Item Short-Form physical and mental component summaries did not change significantly . CONCLUSIONS In this study of adults with subjective memory impairment , a 6-month program of physical activity provided a modest improvement in cognition over an 18-month follow-up period .

180,"IMPORTANCE Studies suggest pioglitazone use may increase risk of cancers . OBJECTIVE To examine whether pioglitazone use for diabetes is associated with risk of bladder and 10 additional cancers . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Cohort and nested case-control analyses among persons with diabetes . A bladder cancer cohort followed 193,099 persons aged 40 years or older in 1997 - 2002 until December 2012 ; 464 case patients and 464 matched controls were surveyed about additional confounders . A cohort analysis of 10 additional cancers included 236,507 persons aged 40 years or older in 1997 - 2005 and followed until June 2012 . Cohorts were from Kaiser Permanente Northern California . EXPOSURES Ever use , duration , cumulative dose , and time since initiation of pioglitazone as time dependent . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident cancer , including bladder , prostate , female breast , lung/bronchus , endometrial , colon , non-Hodgkin lymphoma , pancreas , kidney/renal pelvis , rectum , and melanoma . RESULTS Among 193,099 persons in the bladder cancer cohort , 34,181 ( 18 % ) received pioglitazone ( median duration , 2.8 years ; range , 0.2 - 13.2 years ) and 1261 had incident bladder cancer . Crude incidences of bladder cancer in pioglitazone users and nonusers were 89.8 and 75.9 per 100,000 person-years , respectively . Ever use of pioglitazone was not associated with bladder cancer risk ( adjusted hazard ratio [ HR ] , 1.06 ; 95 % CI , 0.89 - 1.26 ) . Results were similar in case-control analyses ( pioglitazone use : 19.6 % among case patients and 17.5 % among controls ; adjusted odds ratio , 1.18 ; 95 % CI , 0.78 - 1.80 ) . In adjusted analyses , there was no association with 8 of the 10 additional cancers ; ever use of pioglitazone was associated with increased risk of prostate cancer ( HR , 1.13 ; 95 % CI , 1.02 - 1.26 ) and pancreatic cancer ( HR , 1.41 ; 95 % CI , 1.16 - 1.71 ) . Crude incidences of prostate and pancreatic cancer in pioglitazone users vs nonusers were 453.3 vs 449.3 and 81.1 vs 48.4 per 100,000 person-years , respectively . No clear patterns of risk for any cancer were observed for time since initiation , duration , or dose . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Pioglitazone use was not associated with a statistically significant increased risk of bladder cancer , although an increased risk , as previously observed , could not be excluded . The increased prostate and pancreatic cancer risks associated with ever use of pioglitazone merit further investigation to assess whether they are causal or are due to chance , residual confounding , or reverse causality .

181,"Oct4 is a well-known transcription factor that plays fundamental roles in stem cell self-renewal , pluripotency , and somatic cell reprogramming . However , limited information is available on Oct4-associated protein complexes and their intrinsic protein-protein interactions that dictate Oct4 's critical regulatory activities . Here we employed an improved affinity purification approach combined with mass spectrometry to purify Oct4 protein complexes in mouse embryonic stem cells ( mESCs ) , and discovered many novel Oct4 partners important for self-renewal and pluripotency of mESCs . Notably , we found that Oct4 is associated with multiple chromatin-modifying complexes with documented as well as newly proved functional significance in stem cell maintenance and somatic cell reprogramming . Our study establishes a solid biochemical basis for genetic and epigenetic regulation of stem cell pluripotency and provides a framework for exploring alternative factor-based reprogramming strategies . Transcription factors , such as Oct4 , are critical for establishing and maintaining pluripotent cell identity . Whereas the genomic locations of several pluripotency transcription factors have been reported , the spectrum of their interaction partners is underexplored . Here , we use an improved affinity protocol to purify Oct4-interacting proteins from mouse embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) . Subsequent purification of Oct4 partners Sall4 , Tcfcp2l1 , Dax1 , and Esrrb resulted in an Oct4 interactome of 166 proteins , including transcription factors and chromatin-modifying complexes with documented roles in self-renewal , but also many factors not previously associated with the ESC network . We find that Esrrb associated with the basal transcription machinery and also detect interactions between transcription factors and components of the TGF-beta , Notch , and Wnt signaling pathways . Acute depletion of Oct4 reduced binding of Tcfcp2l1 , Dax1 , and Esrrb to several target genes . In conclusion , our purification protocol allowed us to bring greater definition to the circuitry controlling pluripotent cell identity .

184,"CONTEXT Findings from previous studies of the effects of exercise training on patient-reported health status have been inconsistent . OBJECTIVE To test the effects of exercise training on health status among patients with heart failure . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PATIENTS Multicenter , randomized controlled trial among 2331 medically stable outpatients with heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction of 35 % or less . Patients were randomized from April 2003 through February 2007 . INTERVENTIONS Usual care plus aerobic exercise training ( n = 1172 ) , consisting of 36 supervised sessions followed by home-based training , vs usual care alone ( n = 1159 ) . Randomization was stratified by heart failure etiology , which was a covariate in all models . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire ( KCCQ ) overall summary scale and key subscales at baseline , every 3 months for 12 months , and annually thereafter for up to 4 years . The KCCQ is scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores corresponding to better health status . Treatment group effects were estimated using linear mixed models according to the intention-to-treat principle . RESULTS Median follow-up was 2.5 years . At 3 months , usual care plus exercise training led to greater improvement in the KCCQ overall summary score ( mean , 5.21 ; 95 % confidence interval , 4.42 to 6.00 ) compared with usual care alone ( 3.28 ; 95 % confidence interval , 2.48 to 4.09 ) . The additional 1.93-point increase ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.84 to 3.01 ) in the exercise training group was statistically significant ( P < .001 ) . After 3 months , there were no further significant changes in KCCQ score for either group ( P = .85 for the difference between slopes ) , resulting in a sustained , greater improvement overall for the exercise group ( P < .001 ) . Results were similar on the KCCQ subscales , and no subgroup interactions were detected . CONCLUSIONS Exercise training conferred modest but statistically significant improvements in self-reported health status compared with usual care without training . Improvements occurred early and persisted over time . TRIAL REGISTRATION clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT00047437 .

185,"BACKGROUND Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) testing is more sensitive for the detection of high-grade cervical lesions than is cytology , but detection of HPV by DNA screening in two screening rounds 5 years apart has not been assessed . The aim of this study was to assess whether HPV DNA testing in the first screen decreases detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) grade 3 or worse , CIN grade 2 or worse , and cervical cancer in the second screening . METHODS In this randomised trial , women aged 29 - 56 years participating in the cervical screening programme in the Netherlands were randomly assigned to receive HPV DNA ( GP5+/6 + -PCR method ) and cytology co-testing or cytology testing alone , from January , 1999 , to September , 2002 . Randomisation ( in a 1:1 ratio ) was done with computer-generated random numbers after the cervical specimen had been taken . At the second screening 5 years later , HPV DNA and cytology co-testing was done in both groups ; researchers were masked to the patient 's assignment . The primary endpoint was the number of CIN grade 3 or worse detected . Analysis was done by intention to screen . The trial is now finished and is registered , number ISRCTN20781131 . FINDINGS 22,420 women were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 22 518 to the control group ; 19 999 in the intervention group and 20,106 in the control group were eligible for analysis at the first screen . At the second screen , 19 579 women in the intervention group and 19,731 in the control group were eligible , of whom 16,750 and 16,743 , respectively , attended the second screen . In the second round , CIN grade 3 or worse was less common in the intervention group than in the control group ( 88 of 19 579 in the intervention group vs 122 of 19,731 in the control group ; relative risk 0·73 , 95 % CI 0·55 - 0·96 ; p=0·023 ) . Cervical cancer was also less common in the intervention group than in the control group ( four of 19 579 in the intervention group vs 14 of 19,731 ; 0·29 , 0·10 - 0·87 ; p=0·031 ) . In the baseline round , detection of CIN grade 3 or worse did not differ significantly between groups ( 171 of 19 999 vs 150 of 20,106 ; 1·15 , 0·92 - 1·43 ; p=0·239 ) but was significantly more common in women with normal cytology ( 34 of 19,286 vs 12 of 19,373 ; 2·85 , 1·47 - 5·49 ; p=0·001 ) . Furthermore , significantly more cases of CIN grade 2 or worse were detected in the intervention group than in the control group ( 267 of 19 999 vs 215 of 20,106 ; 1·25 , 1·05 - 1·50 ; p=0·015 ) . In the second screen , fewer HPV16-positive CIN grade 3 or worse were detected in the intervention group than in the control group ( 17 of 9481 vs 35 of 9354 ; 0·48 , 0·27 - 0·85 ; p=0·012 ) ; detection of non-HPV16-positive CIN grade 3 or worse did not differ between groups ( 25 of 9481 vs 25 of 9354 ; 0·99 , 0·57 - 1·72 ; p=1·00 ) . The cumulative detection of CIN grade 3 or worse and CIN grade 2 or worse did not differ significantly between study arms , neither for the whole study group ( CIN grade 3 or worse : 259 of 19 999 vs 272 of 20,106 ; 0·96 , 0·81 - 1·14 , p=0·631 ; CIN grade 2 or worse : 427 of 19 999 vs 399 of 20,106 ; 1·08 , 0·94 - 1·24 ; p=0·292 ) , nor for subgroups of women invited for the first time ( CIN grade 3 or worse in women aged 29 - 33 years : 102 of 3139 vs 105 of 3128 ; 0·97 , 0·74 - 1·27 ; CIN grade 2 or worse in women aged 29 - 33 years : 153 of 3139 vs 151 of 3128 ; 1·01 , 0·81 - 1·26 ; CIN grade 3 or worse in women aged 34 - 56 years : 157 of 16,860 vs 167 of 16 978 ; 0·95 , 0·76 - 1·18 ; CIN grade 2 or worse in women aged 34 - 56 years : 274 of 16,860 vs 248 of 16 978 ; 1·11 , 0·94 - 1·32 ) . INTERPRETATION Implementation of HPV DNA testing in cervical screening leads to earlier detection of clinically relevant CIN grade 2 or worse , which when adequately treated , improves protection against CIN grade 3 or worse and cervical cancer . Early detection of high-grade cervical legions caused by HPV16 was a major component of this benefit . Our results lend support to the use of HPV DNA testing for all women aged 29 years and older . FUNDING Zorg Onderzoek Nederland ( Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development ) . BACKGROUND Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) testing is known to be more sensitive , but less specific than cytology for detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) . We assessed the efficacy of cervical-cancer screening policies that are based on HPV testing . METHODS Between March , 2004 , and December , 2004 , in two separate recruitment phases , women aged 25 - 60 years were randomly assigned to conventional cytology or to HPV testing in combination with liquid-based cytology ( first phase ) or alone ( second phase ) . Randomisation was done by computer in two screening centres and by sequential opening of numbered sealed envelopes in the remaining seven centres . During phase one , women who were HPV-positive and aged 35 - 60 years were referred to colposcopy , whereas women aged 25 - 34 years were referred to colposcopy only if cytology was also abnormal or HPV testing was persistently positive . During phase two , women in the HPV group were referred for colposcopy if the HPV test was positive . Two rounds of screening occurred in each phase , and all women had cytology testing only at the second round . The primary endpoint was the detection of grade 2 and 3 CIN , and of invasive cervical cancers during the first and second screening rounds . Analysis was done by intention to screen . This trial is registered , number ISRCTN81678807 . FINDINGS In total for both phases , 47,001 women were randomly assigned to the cytology group and 47,369 to HPV testing . 33,851 women from the cytology group and 32,998 from the HPV-testing group had a second round of screening . We also retrieved the histological diagnoses from screening done elsewhere . The detection of invasive cervical cancers was similar for the two groups in the first round of screening ( nine in the cytology group vs seven in the HPV group , p=0.62 ) ; no cases were detected in the HPV group during round two , compared with nine in the cytology group ( p=0.004 ) . Overall , in the two rounds of screening , 18 invasive cancers were detected in the cytology group versus seven in the HPV group ( p=0.028 ) . Among women aged 35 - 60 years , at round one the relative detection ( HPV vs cytology ) was 2.00 ( 95 % CI 1.44 - 2.77 ) for CIN2 , 2.08 ( 1.47 - 2.95 ) for CIN3 , and 2.03 ( 1.60 - 2.57 ) for CIN2 and 3 together . At round two the relative detection was 0.54 ( 0.23 - 1.28 ) for CIN2 , 0.48 ( 0.21 - 1.11 ) for CIN3 , and 0.51 ( 0.28 - 0.93 ) for CIN2 and 3 together . Among women aged 25 - 34 years , there was significant heterogeneity between phases in the relative detection of CIN3 . At round one the relative detection was 0.93 ( 0.52 - 1.64 ) in phase one and 3.91 ( 2.02 - 7.57 ) in phase two . At round two the relative detection was 1.34 ( 0.46 - 3.84 ) in phase one and 0.20 ( 0.04 - 0.93 ) in phase two . Pooling both phases , the detection ratio of CIN2 for women aged 25 - 34 years was 4.09 ( 2.24 - 7.48 ) at round one and 0.64 ( 0.23 - 1.27 ) at round two . INTERPRETATION HPV-based screening is more effective than cytology in preventing invasive cervical cancer , by detecting persistent high-grade lesions earlier and providing a longer low-risk period . However , in younger women , HPV screening leads to over-diagnosis of regressive CIN2 . FUNDING European Union , Italian Ministry of Health , Regional Health Administrations of Piemonte , Tuscany , Veneto and Emilia-Romagna , and Public Health Agency of Lazio . More than ever , clinicians need regularly updated reviews given the continuously increasing amount of new information regarding innovative cervical cancer prevention methods . A summary is given from recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews on 3 possible clinical applications of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) testing : triage of women with equivocal or low-grade cytologic abnormalities ; prediction of the therapeutic outcome after treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) lesions , and last not but not least , primary screening for cervical cancer and pre-cancer . Consistent evidence is available indicating that HPV-triage with the Hybrid Capture ( ® ) 2 assay ( Qiagen Gaithersburg , Inc. , MD , USA [ previously Digene Corp. ] ( HC2 ) is more accurate ( higher sensitivity , similar specificity ) than repeat cytology to triage women with equivocal Pap smear results . Several other tests show at least similar accuracy but mRNA testing with the APTIMA ( ® ) ( Gen-Probe Inc. , San Diego , CA , USA ) test is similarly sensitive but more specific compared to HC2 . In triage of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions ( LSIL ) , HC2 is more sensitive but its specificity is substantially lower compared to repeat cytology . The APTIMA ( ® ) test is more specific than HC2 without showing a loss in sensitivity . Identification of DNA of HPV types 16 and/or 18 , or RNA from the five most carcinogenic HPV types allow selecting women at highest risk for CIN3 + but the sensitivity and negative predictive value of these markers are lower than full-range high-risk HPV ( hrHPV ) testing . After conservative treatment of cervical pre-cancer , HPV testing picks up more quickly , with higher sensitivity and not lower specificity , residual or recurrent high-grade CIN than follow-up cytology . Primary screening for hrHPV generally detects more CIN2 , CIN3 or cancer compared to cytology at cut-off atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance ( ASC-US ) or LSIL , but is less specific . Combined HPV and cytology screening provides a further small gain in sensitivity at the expense of a considerable loss in specificity if positive by either test is referred to colposcopy , in comparison with HPV testing only . Randomised trials and follow-up of cohort studies consistently demonstrate a significantly lower cumulative incidence of CIN3 + and even of cancer , in women aged 30 years or older , who were at enrollment hrHPV DNA negative compared to those who were cytologically negative . The difference in cumulative risk of CIN3 + or cancer for double negative ( cytology & HPV ) versus only HPV-negative women is small . HC2 , GP5+/6 + PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ) , cobas ( ® ) 4800 PCR ( Roche Molecular Systems Inc. , Alameda , CA , USA ) and Real Time PCR ( Abbott Molecular , Des Plaines , IL , USA ) can be considered as clinically validated for use in primary screening . The loss in specificity associated with primary HPV-based screening can be compensated by appropriate algorithms involving reflex cytology and/or HPV genotyping for HPV16 or 18 . There exists a substantial evidence base to support that HPV testing is advantageous both in triage of women with equivocal abnormal cytology , in surveillance after treatment of CIN lesions and in primary screening of women aged 30 years or older . However , the possible advantages offered by HPV-based screening require a well organised program with good compliance with screening and triage policies . This article forms part of a special supplement entitled "" Comprehensive Control of HPV Infections and Related Diseases "" Vaccine Volume 30 , Supplement 5 , 2012 . BACKGROUND Screening for cervical cancer based on testing for human papillomavirus ( HPV ) increases the sensitivity of detection of high-grade ( grade 2 or 3 ) cervical intraepithelial neoplasia , but whether this gain represents overdiagnosis or protection against future high-grade cervical epithelial neoplasia or cervical cancer is unknown . METHODS In a population-based screening program in Sweden , 12,527 women 32 to 38 years of age were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to have an HPV test plus a Papanicolaou ( Pap ) test ( intervention group ) or a Pap test alone ( control group ) . Women with a positive HPV test and a normal Pap test result were offered a second HPV test at least 1 year later , and those who were found to be persistently infected with the same high-risk type of HPV were then offered colposcopy with cervical biopsy . A similar number of double-blinded Pap smears and colposcopies with biopsy were performed in randomly selected women in the control group . Comprehensive registry data were used to follow the women for a mean of 4.1 years . The relative rates of grade 2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer detected at enrollment and at subsequent screening examinations were calculated . RESULTS At enrollment , the proportion of women in the intervention group who were found to have lesions of grade 2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer was 51 % greater ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 13 to 102 ) than the proportion of women in the control group who were found to have such lesions . At subsequent screening examinations , the proportion of women in the intervention group who were found to have grade 2 or 3 lesions or cancer was 42 % less ( 95 % CI , 4 to 64 ) and the proportion with grade 3 lesions or cancer was 47 % less ( 95 % CI , 2 to 71 ) than the proportions of control women who were found to have such lesions . Women with persistent HPV infection remained at high risk for grade 2 or 3 lesions or cancer after referral for colposcopy . CONCLUSIONS The addition of an HPV test to the Pap test to screen women in their mid-30s for cervical cancer reduces the incidence of grade 2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer detected by subsequent screening examinations .

186,"BACKGROUND Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) testing is more sensitive for the detection of high-grade cervical lesions than is cytology , but detection of HPV by DNA screening in two screening rounds 5 years apart has not been assessed . The aim of this study was to assess whether HPV DNA testing in the first screen decreases detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) grade 3 or worse , CIN grade 2 or worse , and cervical cancer in the second screening . METHODS In this randomised trial , women aged 29 - 56 years participating in the cervical screening programme in the Netherlands were randomly assigned to receive HPV DNA ( GP5+/6 + -PCR method ) and cytology co-testing or cytology testing alone , from January , 1999 , to September , 2002 . Randomisation ( in a 1:1 ratio ) was done with computer-generated random numbers after the cervical specimen had been taken . At the second screening 5 years later , HPV DNA and cytology co-testing was done in both groups ; researchers were masked to the patient 's assignment . The primary endpoint was the number of CIN grade 3 or worse detected . Analysis was done by intention to screen . The trial is now finished and is registered , number ISRCTN20781131 . FINDINGS 22,420 women were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 22 518 to the control group ; 19 999 in the intervention group and 20,106 in the control group were eligible for analysis at the first screen . At the second screen , 19 579 women in the intervention group and 19,731 in the control group were eligible , of whom 16,750 and 16,743 , respectively , attended the second screen . In the second round , CIN grade 3 or worse was less common in the intervention group than in the control group ( 88 of 19 579 in the intervention group vs 122 of 19,731 in the control group ; relative risk 0·73 , 95 % CI 0·55 - 0·96 ; p=0·023 ) . Cervical cancer was also less common in the intervention group than in the control group ( four of 19 579 in the intervention group vs 14 of 19,731 ; 0·29 , 0·10 - 0·87 ; p=0·031 ) . In the baseline round , detection of CIN grade 3 or worse did not differ significantly between groups ( 171 of 19 999 vs 150 of 20,106 ; 1·15 , 0·92 - 1·43 ; p=0·239 ) but was significantly more common in women with normal cytology ( 34 of 19,286 vs 12 of 19,373 ; 2·85 , 1·47 - 5·49 ; p=0·001 ) . Furthermore , significantly more cases of CIN grade 2 or worse were detected in the intervention group than in the control group ( 267 of 19 999 vs 215 of 20,106 ; 1·25 , 1·05 - 1·50 ; p=0·015 ) . In the second screen , fewer HPV16-positive CIN grade 3 or worse were detected in the intervention group than in the control group ( 17 of 9481 vs 35 of 9354 ; 0·48 , 0·27 - 0·85 ; p=0·012 ) ; detection of non-HPV16-positive CIN grade 3 or worse did not differ between groups ( 25 of 9481 vs 25 of 9354 ; 0·99 , 0·57 - 1·72 ; p=1·00 ) . The cumulative detection of CIN grade 3 or worse and CIN grade 2 or worse did not differ significantly between study arms , neither for the whole study group ( CIN grade 3 or worse : 259 of 19 999 vs 272 of 20,106 ; 0·96 , 0·81 - 1·14 , p=0·631 ; CIN grade 2 or worse : 427 of 19 999 vs 399 of 20,106 ; 1·08 , 0·94 - 1·24 ; p=0·292 ) , nor for subgroups of women invited for the first time ( CIN grade 3 or worse in women aged 29 - 33 years : 102 of 3139 vs 105 of 3128 ; 0·97 , 0·74 - 1·27 ; CIN grade 2 or worse in women aged 29 - 33 years : 153 of 3139 vs 151 of 3128 ; 1·01 , 0·81 - 1·26 ; CIN grade 3 or worse in women aged 34 - 56 years : 157 of 16,860 vs 167 of 16 978 ; 0·95 , 0·76 - 1·18 ; CIN grade 2 or worse in women aged 34 - 56 years : 274 of 16,860 vs 248 of 16 978 ; 1·11 , 0·94 - 1·32 ) . INTERPRETATION Implementation of HPV DNA testing in cervical screening leads to earlier detection of clinically relevant CIN grade 2 or worse , which when adequately treated , improves protection against CIN grade 3 or worse and cervical cancer . Early detection of high-grade cervical legions caused by HPV16 was a major component of this benefit . Our results lend support to the use of HPV DNA testing for all women aged 29 years and older . FUNDING Zorg Onderzoek Nederland ( Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development ) . OBJECTIVE To assess the performance and impact of primary human papillomavirus ( HPV ) DNA screening with cytology triage compared with conventional cytology on cervical cancer and severe pre-cancerous lesions . DESIGN Randomised trial . SETTING Population based screening programme for cervical cancer in southern Finland in 2003 - 5 . PARTICIPANTS 58 076 women , aged 30 - 60 , invited to the routine population based screening programme for cervical cancer . INTERVENTIONS Primary HPV DNA test ( hybrid capture II ) with cytology triage if the result was positive or conventional cytological screening ( reference ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Rate of cervical cancer , cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) grade III , and adenocarcinoma in situ ( as a composite outcome referred to as CIN III+ ) during 2003 - 7 through record linkage between files from the screening registry and the national cancer registry . RESULTS In the HPV and conventional arms there were 95 600 and 95 700 woman years of follow-up and 76 and 53 cases of CIN III+ , respectively ( of which six and eight were cervical cancers ) . The relative rate of CIN III+ in the HPV arm versus the conventional arm was 1.44 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.01 to 2.05 ) among all women invited for screening and 1.77 ( 1.16 to 2.74 ) among those who attended . Among women with a normal or negative test result , the relative rate of subsequent CIN III+ was 0.28 ( 0.04 to 1.17 ) . The rate of cervical cancer between arms was 0.75 ( 0.25 to 2.16 ) among women invited for screening and 1.98 ( 0.52 to 9.38 ) among those who attended . CONCLUSIONS When incorporated into a well established organised screening programme , primary HPV screening with cytology triage was more sensitive than conventional cytology in detecting CIN III+ lesions . The number of cases of cervical cancer was small , but considering the high probability of progression of CIN III the findings are of importance regarding cancer prevention . TRIAL REGISTRATION Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN23885553 . BACKGROUND Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) testing is known to be more sensitive , but less specific than cytology for detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) . We assessed the efficacy of cervical-cancer screening policies that are based on HPV testing . METHODS Between March , 2004 , and December , 2004 , in two separate recruitment phases , women aged 25 - 60 years were randomly assigned to conventional cytology or to HPV testing in combination with liquid-based cytology ( first phase ) or alone ( second phase ) . Randomisation was done by computer in two screening centres and by sequential opening of numbered sealed envelopes in the remaining seven centres . During phase one , women who were HPV-positive and aged 35 - 60 years were referred to colposcopy , whereas women aged 25 - 34 years were referred to colposcopy only if cytology was also abnormal or HPV testing was persistently positive . During phase two , women in the HPV group were referred for colposcopy if the HPV test was positive . Two rounds of screening occurred in each phase , and all women had cytology testing only at the second round . The primary endpoint was the detection of grade 2 and 3 CIN , and of invasive cervical cancers during the first and second screening rounds . Analysis was done by intention to screen . This trial is registered , number ISRCTN81678807 . FINDINGS In total for both phases , 47,001 women were randomly assigned to the cytology group and 47,369 to HPV testing . 33,851 women from the cytology group and 32,998 from the HPV-testing group had a second round of screening . We also retrieved the histological diagnoses from screening done elsewhere . The detection of invasive cervical cancers was similar for the two groups in the first round of screening ( nine in the cytology group vs seven in the HPV group , p=0.62 ) ; no cases were detected in the HPV group during round two , compared with nine in the cytology group ( p=0.004 ) . Overall , in the two rounds of screening , 18 invasive cancers were detected in the cytology group versus seven in the HPV group ( p=0.028 ) . Among women aged 35 - 60 years , at round one the relative detection ( HPV vs cytology ) was 2.00 ( 95 % CI 1.44 - 2.77 ) for CIN2 , 2.08 ( 1.47 - 2.95 ) for CIN3 , and 2.03 ( 1.60 - 2.57 ) for CIN2 and 3 together . At round two the relative detection was 0.54 ( 0.23 - 1.28 ) for CIN2 , 0.48 ( 0.21 - 1.11 ) for CIN3 , and 0.51 ( 0.28 - 0.93 ) for CIN2 and 3 together . Among women aged 25 - 34 years , there was significant heterogeneity between phases in the relative detection of CIN3 . At round one the relative detection was 0.93 ( 0.52 - 1.64 ) in phase one and 3.91 ( 2.02 - 7.57 ) in phase two . At round two the relative detection was 1.34 ( 0.46 - 3.84 ) in phase one and 0.20 ( 0.04 - 0.93 ) in phase two . Pooling both phases , the detection ratio of CIN2 for women aged 25 - 34 years was 4.09 ( 2.24 - 7.48 ) at round one and 0.64 ( 0.23 - 1.27 ) at round two . INTERPRETATION HPV-based screening is more effective than cytology in preventing invasive cervical cancer , by detecting persistent high-grade lesions earlier and providing a longer low-risk period . However , in younger women , HPV screening leads to over-diagnosis of regressive CIN2 . FUNDING European Union , Italian Ministry of Health , Regional Health Administrations of Piemonte , Tuscany , Veneto and Emilia-Romagna , and Public Health Agency of Lazio . More than ever , clinicians need regularly updated reviews given the continuously increasing amount of new information regarding innovative cervical cancer prevention methods . A summary is given from recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews on 3 possible clinical applications of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) testing : triage of women with equivocal or low-grade cytologic abnormalities ; prediction of the therapeutic outcome after treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) lesions , and last not but not least , primary screening for cervical cancer and pre-cancer . Consistent evidence is available indicating that HPV-triage with the Hybrid Capture ( ® ) 2 assay ( Qiagen Gaithersburg , Inc. , MD , USA [ previously Digene Corp. ] ( HC2 ) is more accurate ( higher sensitivity , similar specificity ) than repeat cytology to triage women with equivocal Pap smear results . Several other tests show at least similar accuracy but mRNA testing with the APTIMA ( ® ) ( Gen-Probe Inc. , San Diego , CA , USA ) test is similarly sensitive but more specific compared to HC2 . In triage of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions ( LSIL ) , HC2 is more sensitive but its specificity is substantially lower compared to repeat cytology . The APTIMA ( ® ) test is more specific than HC2 without showing a loss in sensitivity . Identification of DNA of HPV types 16 and/or 18 , or RNA from the five most carcinogenic HPV types allow selecting women at highest risk for CIN3 + but the sensitivity and negative predictive value of these markers are lower than full-range high-risk HPV ( hrHPV ) testing . After conservative treatment of cervical pre-cancer , HPV testing picks up more quickly , with higher sensitivity and not lower specificity , residual or recurrent high-grade CIN than follow-up cytology . Primary screening for hrHPV generally detects more CIN2 , CIN3 or cancer compared to cytology at cut-off atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance ( ASC-US ) or LSIL , but is less specific . Combined HPV and cytology screening provides a further small gain in sensitivity at the expense of a considerable loss in specificity if positive by either test is referred to colposcopy , in comparison with HPV testing only . Randomised trials and follow-up of cohort studies consistently demonstrate a significantly lower cumulative incidence of CIN3 + and even of cancer , in women aged 30 years or older , who were at enrollment hrHPV DNA negative compared to those who were cytologically negative . The difference in cumulative risk of CIN3 + or cancer for double negative ( cytology & HPV ) versus only HPV-negative women is small . HC2 , GP5+/6 + PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ) , cobas ( ® ) 4800 PCR ( Roche Molecular Systems Inc. , Alameda , CA , USA ) and Real Time PCR ( Abbott Molecular , Des Plaines , IL , USA ) can be considered as clinically validated for use in primary screening . The loss in specificity associated with primary HPV-based screening can be compensated by appropriate algorithms involving reflex cytology and/or HPV genotyping for HPV16 or 18 . There exists a substantial evidence base to support that HPV testing is advantageous both in triage of women with equivocal abnormal cytology , in surveillance after treatment of CIN lesions and in primary screening of women aged 30 years or older . However , the possible advantages offered by HPV-based screening require a well organised program with good compliance with screening and triage policies .

187,"OBJECTIVES We investigated the role of cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) and interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) in cachexia development in newly diagnosed nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patients . METHODS : We evaluated 44 ( M/F:41/3 ) NSCLC patients and 12 ( M/F:10/2 ) age matched healthy smokers . NSCLC cases with a weight loss of > or = 10 % consisted the cachectic group ( n:23 , M/F:21/2 ) and the ones with < 10 % weight loss consisted the noncachectic group ( n:21 , M/F:19/2 ) . RESULTS Body mass index ( BMI ) of cachectics was significantly lower than that of noncachectics ( 21.0 + /- 2.9 versus 24.5 + /- 3.6 , P = 0.02 ) and controls ( 21.0 + /- 2.9 versus 25.5 + /- 2.6 , P = 0.01 ) . Serum TNF-alpha level did not differ between cachectic and noncachectics ( 37.3 + /- 39.1 and 51.6 + /- 84.2 pg/mL , respectively ) . However , it was significantly higher in NSCLC patients compared with controls ( 44.1 + /- 64.3 and 15.1 + /- 14.3 pg/mL , P = 0.03 ) . Serum IL-6 level was not different between 3 groups ( 6.4 + /- 4.1 , 8.9 + /- 16.3 , and 4.1 + /- 3.5 pg/mL , respectively ) but it correlated significantly with TNF-alpha ( r = 0.4 , P = 0.006 ) and BMI ( r = -0.3 , P = 0.03 ) . Erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) correlated significantly with TNF-alpha ( r = 0.4 , P = 0.003 ) and BMI ( r = -0.3 , P = 0.03 ) . Among 44 cases , survival of 12 and 17 patients was recorded in cachectics and noncachectics , with no statistical difference ( 12.2 + /- 3.7 and 11.2 + /- 1.0 months , respectively ) . CONCLUSIONS TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels did not differ significantly between cachectics and noncachectics . However , significant correlations between IL-6 , BMI , and TNF-alpha suggested that these cytokines acted as cofactors in weight loss . Survival was neither influenced by BMI , nor the cytokine levels in the present study . The significant correlation of ESR with TNF-alpha suggested that ESR could provide valuable clue for considerable weight loss in the follow-up of NSCLC patients .

188,"Reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) resets their identity back to an embryonic age and , thus , presents a significant hurdle for modeling late-onset disorders . In this study , we describe a strategy for inducing aging-related features in human iPSC-derived lineages and apply it to the modeling of Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . Our approach involves expression of progerin , a truncated form of lamin A associated with premature aging . We found that expression of progerin in iPSC-derived fibroblasts and neurons induces multiple aging-related markers and characteristics , including dopamine-specific phenotypes such as neuromelanin accumulation . Induced aging in PD iPSC-derived dopamine neurons revealed disease phenotypes that require both aging and genetic susceptibility , such as pronounced dendrite degeneration , progressive loss of tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) expression , and enlarged mitochondria or Lewy-body-precursor inclusions . Thus , our study suggests that progerin-induced aging can be used to reveal late-onset age-related disease features in hiPSC-based disease models .

194,"The thymic medulla provides a specialized microenvironment for the negative selection of T cells , with the presence of autoimmune regulator (Aire)-expressing medullary thymic epithelial cells ( mTECs ) during the embryonic-neonatal period being both necessary and sufficient to establish long-lasting tolerance . Here we showed that emergence of the first cohorts of Aire(+ ) mTECs at this key developmental stage , prior to αβ T cell repertoire selection , was jointly directed by Rankl(+ ) lymphoid tissue inducer cells and invariant Vγ5(+ ) dendritic epidermal T cell ( DETC ) progenitors that are the first thymocytes to express the products of gene rearrangement . In turn , generation of Aire(+ ) mTECs then fostered Skint-1-dependent , but Aire-independent , DETC progenitor maturation and the emergence of an invariant DETC repertoire . Hence , our data attributed a functional importance to the temporal development of Vγ5(+ ) γδ T cells during thymus medulla formation for αβ T cell tolerance induction and demonstrated a Rank-mediated reciprocal link between DETC and Aire(+ ) mTEC maturation . Medullary thymic epithelial cells ( mTECs ) establish T cell self-tolerance through the expression of autoimmune regulator ( Aire ) and peripheral tissue-specific self-antigens . However , signals underlying mTEC development remain largely unclear . Here , we demonstrate crucial regulation of mTEC development by receptor activator of NF-kappaB ( RANK ) and CD40 signals . Whereas only RANK signaling was essential for mTEC development during embryogenesis , in postnatal mice , cooperation between CD40 and RANK signals was required for mTEC development to successfully establish the medullary microenvironment . Ligation of RANK or CD40 on fetal thymic stroma in vitro induced mTEC development in a tumor necrosis factor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)- , NF-kappaB inducing kinase (NIK)- , and IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta)-dependent manner . These results show that developmental-stage-dependent cooperation between RANK and CD40 promotes mTEC development , thereby establishing self-tolerance . Aire-expressing medullary thymic epithelial cells ( mTECs ) play a key role in preventing autoimmunity by expressing tissue-restricted antigens to help purge the emerging T cell receptor repertoire of self-reactive specificities . Here we demonstrate a novel role for a CD4 + 3− inducer cell population , previously linked to development of organized secondary lymphoid structures and maintenance of T cell memory in the functional regulation of Aire-mediated promiscuous gene expression in the thymus . CD4 + 3− cells are closely associated with mTECs in adult thymus , and in fetal thymus their appearance is temporally linked with the appearance of Aire+ mTECs . We show that RANKL signals from this cell promote the maturation of RANK-expressing CD80−Aire− mTEC progenitors into CD80+Aire+ mTECs , and that transplantation of RANK-deficient thymic stroma into immunodeficient hosts induces autoimmunity . Collectively , our data reveal cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to the generation of Aire+ mTECs and highlight a previously unrecognized role for CD4 + 3−RANKL+ inducer cells in intrathymic self-tolerance .

195,"OBJECTIVE To investigate the long term effect of radioactive iodine on thyroid function and size in patients with non-toxic multinodular goitre . DESIGN Consecutive patients with multinodular non-toxic goitre selected for radioactive iodine treatment and followed for a minimum of 12 months ( median 48 months ) after an intended dose of 3.7 MBq/g thyroid tissue corrected to a 100 % uptake of iodine-131 in 24 hours . PATIENTS 69 patients with a growing multinodular non-toxic goitre causing local compression symptoms or cosmetic inconveniences . The treatment was chosen because of a high operative risk , previous thyroidectomy , or refusal to be operated on . MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Standard thyroid function variables and ultrasonically determined thyroid volume before treatment as well as 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , and 12 months after treatment and then once a year . RESULTS 56 patients were treated with a single dose of 131I , 12 with two doses , and one with four doses . In 45 patients treated with one dose and remaining euthyroid the median thyroid volume was reduced from 73 ( interquartile range 50 - 106 ) ml to 29 ( 23 - 48 ) ml at 24 months in the 39 patients in whom this was measured during follow up . The median reduction was 40 ( 22 - 48 ) ml ( 60 % reduction , p < 0.0001 ) , half of which occurred within three months . Patients treated with two doses as well as those developing hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism had a significant reduction in thyroid volume . Eleven patients developed hypothyroidism ( cumulative five year risk 22 % , 95 % confidence interval 4.8 % to 38.4 % ) . Side effects were few : three cases of hyperthyroidism and two cases of radiation thyroiditis . Only one patient was dissatisfied with the result ; she was referred for operation six months after treatment . CONCLUSIONS A substantial reduction in thyroid volume accompanied by a low incidence of hypothyroidism and few side effects makes the use of radioactive iodine an attractive alternative to surgery in selected cases of non-toxic multinodular goitre .

196,"Numerous reports have demonstrated that CD4(+)CD25(+ ) regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) from individuals with a range of human autoimmune diseases , including type 1 diabetes , are deficient in their ability to control autologous proinflammatory responses when compared with nondiseased , control individuals . Treg dysfunction could be a primary , causal event or may result from perturbations in the immune system during disease development . Polymorphisms in genes associated with Treg function , such as IL2RA , confer a higher risk of autoimmune disease . Although this suggests a primary role for defective Tregs in autoimmunity , a link between IL2RA gene polymorphisms and Treg function has not been examined . We addressed this by examining the impact of an IL2RA haplotype associated with type 1 diabetes on Treg fitness and suppressive function . Studies were conducted using healthy human subjects to avoid any confounding effects of disease . We demonstrated that the presence of an autoimmune disease-associated IL2RA haplotype correlates with diminished IL-2 responsiveness in Ag-experienced CD4(+ ) T cells , as measured by phosphorylation of STAT5a , and is associated with lower levels of FOXP3 expression by Tregs and a reduction in their ability to suppress proliferation of autologous effector T cells . These data offer a rationale that contributes to the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which polymorphisms in the IL-2RA gene affect immune regulation , and consequently upon susceptibility to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases . Autoimmune diseases are thought to result from imbalances in normal immune physiology and regulation . Here , we show that autoimmune disease susceptibility and resistance alleles on mouse chromosome 3 ( Idd3 ) correlate with differential expression of the key immunoregulatory cytokine interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) . In order to test directly that an approximately twofold reduction in IL-2 underpins the Idd3-linked destabilization of immune homeostasis , we show that engineered haplodeficiency of Il2 gene expression not only reduces T cell IL-2 production by twofold but also mimics the autoimmune dysregulatory effects of the naturally occurring susceptibility alleles of Il2 . Reduced IL-2 production achieved by either genetic mechanism correlates with reduced function of CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells , which are critical for maintaining immune homeostasis .

200,"BACKGROUND Interleukin (IL)-18 is a potent proinflammatory cytokine with potential atherogenic properties . Its expression and role in atherosclerosis , however , are unknown . METHODS AND RESULTS In the present study , we examined stable and unstable human carotid atherosclerotic plaques retrieved by endarterectomy for the presence of IL-18 using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , Western blot , and immunohistochemical techniques . IL-18 was highly expressed in the atherosclerotic plaques compared with control normal arteries and was localized mainly in plaque macrophages . IL-18 receptor was also upregulated in plaque macrophages and endothelial cells , suggesting potential biological effects . To examine the role of IL-18 in atherosclerosis , we determined the relation between IL-18 mRNA expression and signs of plaque instability using real-time quantitative PCR . Interestingly , significantly higher levels of IL-18 mRNA were found in symptomatic ( unstable ) plaques than asymptomatic ( stable ) plaques ( P<0.01 ) .

201,"Historically , the ribosome has been viewed as a complex ribozyme with constitutive rather than regulatory capacity in mRNA translation . Here we identify mutations of the Ribosomal Protein L38 ( Rpl38 ) gene in mice exhibiting surprising tissue-specific patterning defects , including pronounced homeotic transformations of the axial skeleton . In Rpl38 mutant embryos , global protein synthesis is unchanged ; however the translation of a select subset of Homeobox mRNAs is perturbed . Our data reveal that RPL38 facilitates 80S complex formation on these mRNAs as a regulatory component of the ribosome to confer transcript-specific translational control . We further show that Rpl38 expression is markedly enriched in regions of the embryo where loss-of-function phenotypes occur . Unexpectedly , a ribosomal protein ( RP ) expression screen reveals dynamic regulation of individual RPs within the vertebrate embryo . Collectively , these findings suggest that RP activity may be highly regulated to impart a new layer of specificity in the control of gene expression and mammalian development .

202,"Background Extensive debate exists in the healthcare community over whether outcomes of medical care at teaching hospitals and other healthcare units are better or worse than those at the respective nonteaching ones . Thus , our goal was to systematically evaluate the evidence pertaining to this question . Methods and Findings We reviewed all studies that compared teaching versus nonteaching healthcare structures for mortality or any other patient outcome , regardless of health condition . Studies were retrieved from PubMed , contact with experts , and literature cross-referencing . Data were extracted on setting , patients , data sources , author affiliations , definition of compared groups , types of diagnoses considered , adjusting covariates , and estimates of effect for mortality and for each other outcome . Overall , 132 eligible studies were identified , including 93 on mortality and 61 on other eligible outcomes ( 22 addressed both ) . Synthesis of the available adjusted estimates on mortality yielded a summary relative risk of 0.96 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.93–1.00 ) for teaching versus nonteaching healthcare structures and 1.04 ( 95 % CI , 0.99–1.10 ) for minor teaching versus nonteaching ones . There was considerable heterogeneity between studies ( I2 = 72 % for the main analysis ) . Results were similar in studies using clinical and those using administrative databases . No differences were seen in the 14 studies fully adjusting for volume/experience , severity , and comorbidity ( relative risk 1.01 ) . Smaller studies did not differ in their results from larger studies . Differences were seen for some diagnoses ( e.g. , significantly better survival for breast cancer and cerebrovascular accidents in teaching hospitals and significantly better survival from cholecystectomy in nonteaching hospitals ) , but these were small in magnitude . Other outcomes were diverse , but typically teaching healthcare structures did not do better than nonteaching ones . Conclusions The available data are limited by their nonrandomized design , but overall they do not suggest that a healthcare facility 's teaching status on its own markedly improves or worsens patient outcomes . Differences for specific diseases can not be excluded , but are likely to be small .

203,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate if a specific exercise strategy , targeting the rotator cuff and scapula stabilisers , improves shoulder function and pain more than unspecific exercises in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome , thereby decreasing the need for arthroscopic subacromial decompression . DESIGN Randomised , participant and single assessor blinded , controlled study . SETTING Department of orthopaedics in a Swedish university hospital . PARTICIPANTS 102 patients with long standing ( over six months ) persistent subacromial impingement syndrome in whom earlier conservative treatment had failed , recruited through orthopaedic specialists . INTERVENTIONS The specific exercise strategy consisted of strengthening eccentric exercises for the rotator cuff and concentric/eccentric exercises for the scapula stabilisers in combination with manual mobilisation . The control exercise programme consisted of unspecific movement exercises for the neck and shoulder . Patients in both groups received five to six individual guided treatment sessions during 12 weeks . In between these supervised sessions the participants performed home exercises once or twice a day for 12 weeks . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the Constant-Murley shoulder assessment score evaluating shoulder function and pain . Secondary outcomes were patients ' global impression of change because of treatment and decision regarding surgery . RESULTS Most ( 97 , 95 % ) participants completed the 12 week study . There was a significantly greater improvement in the Constant-Murley score in the specific exercise group than in the control exercise group ( 24 points ( 95 % confidence interval 19 to 28.0 ) v 9 points ( 5 to 13 ) ; mean difference between group : 15 points ( 8.5 to 20.6 ) ) . Significantly more patients in the specific exercise group reported successful outcome ( defined as large improvement or recovered ) in the patients ' global assessment of change because of treatment : 69 % ( 35/51 ) v 24 % ( 11/46 ) ; odds ratio 7.6 , 3.1 to 18.9 ; P<0.001 . A significantly lower proportion of patients in the specific exercise group subsequently chose to undergo surgery : 20 % ( 10/51 ) v 63 % ( 29/46 ) ; odds ratio 7.7 , 3.1 to 19.4 ; P<0.001 ) . CONCLUSION A specific exercise strategy , focusing on strengthening eccentric exercises for the rotator cuff and concentric/eccentric exercises for the scapula stabilisers , is effective in reducing pain and improving shoulder function in patients with persistent subacromial impingement syndrome . By extension , this exercise strategy reduces the need for arthroscopic subacromial decompression within the three month timeframe used in the study . TRIAL REGISTRATION Clinical trials NCT01037673 .

204,"A key determinant of geriatric frailty is sarcopenia , the age-associated loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength . Although the etiology of sarcopenia is unknown , the correlation during aging between the loss of activity of satellite cells , which are endogenous muscle stem cells , and impaired muscle regenerative capacity has led to the hypothesis that the loss of satellite cell activity is also a cause of sarcopenia . We tested this hypothesis in male sedentary mice by experimentally depleting satellite cells in young adult animals to a degree sufficient to impair regeneration throughout the rest of their lives . A detailed analysis of multiple muscles harvested at various time points during aging in different cohorts of these mice showed that the muscles were of normal size , despite low regenerative capacity , but did have increased fibrosis . These results suggest that lifelong reduction of satellite cells neither accelerated nor exacerbated sarcopenia and that satellite cells did not contribute to the maintenance of muscle size or fiber type composition during aging , but that their loss may contribute to age-related muscle fibrosis .

205,"Importance Estimates from claims-based analyses suggest that the incidence of sepsis is increasing and mortality rates from sepsis are decreasing . However , estimates from claims data may lack clinical fidelity and can be affected by changing diagnosis and coding practices over time . Objective To estimate the US national incidence of sepsis and trends using detailed clinical data from the electronic health record ( EHR ) systems of diverse hospitals . Design , Setting , and Population Retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted to 409 academic , community , and federal hospitals from 2009 - 2014 . Exposures Sepsis was identified using clinical indicators of presumed infection and concurrent acute organ dysfunction , adapting Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock ( Sepsis-3 ) criteria for objective and consistent EHR-based surveillance . Main Outcomes and Measures Sepsis incidence , outcomes , and trends from 2009 - 2014 were calculated using regression models and compared with claims-based estimates using International Classification of Diseases , Ninth Revision , Clinical Modification codes for severe sepsis or septic shock . Case-finding criteria were validated against Sepsis-3 criteria using medical record reviews . Results A total of 173 690 sepsis cases ( mean age , 66.5 [ SD , 15.5 ] y ; 77 660 [ 42.4 % ] women ) were identified using clinical criteria among 2 901 019 adults admitted to study hospitals in 2014 ( 6.0 % incidence ) . Of these , 26 061 ( 15.0 % ) died in the hospital and 10 731 ( 6.2 % ) were discharged to hospice . From 2009 - 2014 , sepsis incidence using clinical criteria was stable ( + 0.6 % relative change/y [ 95 % CI , −2.3 % to 3.5 % ] , P = .67 ) whereas incidence per claims increased ( + 10.3%/y [ 95 % CI , 7.2 % to 13.3 % ] , P < .001 ) . In-hospital mortality using clinical criteria declined ( −3.3%/y [ 95 % CI , −5.6 % to −1.0 % ] , P = .004 ) , but there was no significant change in the combined outcome of death or discharge to hospice ( −1.3%/y [ 95 % CI , −3.2 % to 0.6 % ] , P = .19 ) . In contrast , mortality using claims declined significantly ( −7.0%/y [ 95 % CI , −8.8 % to −5.2 % ] , P < .001 ) , as did death or discharge to hospice ( −4.5%/y [ 95 % CI , −6.1 % to −2.8 % ] , P < .001 ) . Clinical criteria were more sensitive in identifying sepsis than claims ( 69.7 % [ 95 % CI , 52.9 % to 92.0 % ] vs 32.3 % [ 95 % CI , 24.4 % to 43.0 % ] , P < .001 ) , with comparable positive predictive value ( 70.4 % [ 95 % CI , 64.0 % to 76.8 % ] vs 75.2 % [ 95 % CI , 69.8 % to 80.6 % ] , P = .23 ) . Conclusions and Relevance In clinical data from 409 hospitals , sepsis was present in 6 % of adult hospitalizations , and in contrast to claims-based analyses , neither the incidence of sepsis nor the combined outcome of death or discharge to hospice changed significantly between 2009 - 2014 . The findings also suggest that EHR-based clinical data provide more objective estimates than claims-based data for sepsis surveillance .

206,"OBJECTIVES To investigate the association between antidepressant treatment and risk of several potential adverse outcomes in older people with depression and to examine risks by class of antidepressant , duration of use , and dose . DESIGN Cohort study of people aged 65 and over diagnosed as having depression . SETTING 570 general practices in the United Kingdom supplying data to the QResearch primary care database . PARTICIPANTS 60,746 patients diagnosed as having a new episode of depression between the ages of 65 and 100 years from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 2007 and followed up until 31 December 2008 . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Hazard ratios associated with antidepressant use for all cause mortality , attempted suicide/self harm , myocardial infarction , stroke/transient ischaemic attack , falls , fractures , upper gastrointestinal bleeding , epilepsy/seizures , road traffic accidents , adverse drug reactions , and hyponatraemia , adjusted for a range of potential confounding variables . Hazard ratios were calculated for antidepressant class ( tricyclic and related antidepressants , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , other antidepressants ) , dose , and duration of use and for commonly prescribed individual drugs . RESULTS 54,038 ( 89.0 % ) patients received at least one prescription for an antidepressant during follow-up . A total of 1,398,359 antidepressant prescriptions were issued : 764,659 ( 54.7 % ) for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , 442,192 ( 31.6 % ) for tricyclic antidepressants , 2203 ( 0.2 % ) for monoamine oxidase inhibitors , and 189,305 ( 13.5 % ) for the group of other antidepressants . The associations with the adverse outcomes differed significantly between the antidepressant classes for seven outcomes . Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were associated with the highest adjusted hazard ratios for falls ( 1.66 , 95 % confidence interval 1.58 to 1.73 ) and hyponatraemia ( 1.52 , 1.33 to 1.75 ) compared with when antidepressants were not being used . The group of other antidepressants was associated with the highest adjusted hazard ratios for all cause mortality ( 1.66 , 1.56 to 1.77 ) , attempted suicide/self harm ( 5.16 , 3.90 to 6.83 ) , stroke/transient ischaemic attack ( 1.37 , 1.22 to 1.55 ) , fracture ( 1.64 , 1.46 to 1.84 ) , and epilepsy/seizures ( 2.24 , 1.60 to 3.15 ) , compared with when antidepressants were not being used . Tricyclic antidepressants did not have the highest hazard ratio for any of the outcomes . Significantly different associations also existed between the individual drugs for the same seven outcomes ; trazodone ( tricyclic antidepressant ) , mirtazapine , and venlafaxine ( both in the group of other antidepressants ) were associated with the highest rates for some of these outcomes . Absolute risks over 1 year for all cause mortality were 7.04 % for patients while not taking antidepressants , 8.12 % for those taking tricyclic antidepressants , 10.61 % for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , and 11.43 % for other antidepressants . CONCLUSIONS Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and drugs in the group of other antidepressants were associated with an increased risk of several adverse outcomes compared with tricyclic antidepressants . Among individual drugs , trazodone , mirtazapine , and venlafaxine were associated with the highest risks for some outcomes . As this is an observational study , it is susceptible to confounding by indication , channelling bias , and residual confounding , so differences in characteristics between patients prescribed different antidepressant drugs that could account for some of the associations between the drugs and the adverse outcomes may remain . Further research is needed to confirm these findings , but the risks and benefits of different antidepressants should be carefully evaluated when these drugs are prescribed to older people .

208,"CONTEXT Sexual dysfunction is a common adverse effect of antidepressants that frequently results in treatment noncompliance . OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy of sildenafil citrate in men with sexual dysfunction associated with the use of selective and nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SRI ) antidepressants . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PATIENTS Prospective , parallel-group , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted between November 1 , 2000 , and January 1 , 2001 , at 3 US university medical centers among 90 male outpatients ( mean [ SD ] age , 45 [ 8 ] years ) with major depression in remission and sexual dysfunction associated with SRI antidepressant treatment . INTERVENTION Patients were randomly assigned to take sildenafil ( n = 45 ) or placebo ( n = 45 ) at a flexible dose starting at 50 mg and adjustable to 100 mg before sexual activity for 6 weeks . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measure was score on the Clinical Global Impression-Sexual Function ( CGI-SF ) ; secondary measures were scores on the International Index of Erectile Function , Arizona Sexual Experience Scale , Massachusetts General Hospital-Sexual Functioning Questionnaire , and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ( HAM-D ) . RESULTS Among the 90 randomized patients , 93 % ( 83/89 ) of patients treated per protocol took at least 1 dose of study drug and 85 % ( 76/89 ) completed week 6 end-point assessments with last observation carried forward analyses . At a CGI-SF score of 2 or lower , 54.5 % ( 24/44 ) of sildenafil compared with 4.4 % ( 2/45 ) of placebo patients were much or very much improved ( P<.001 ) . Erectile function , arousal , ejaculation , orgasm , and overall satisfaction domain measures improved significantly in sildenafil compared with placebo patients . Mean depression scores remained consistent with remission ( HAM-D score < or = 10 ) in both groups for the study duration .

209,"Modification of proteins by SUMO is essential for the maintenance of genome integrity . During DNA replication , the Mms21-branch of the SUMO pathway counteracts recombination intermediates at damaged replication forks , thus facilitating sister chromatid disjunction . The Mms21 SUMO ligase docks to the arm region of the Smc5 protein in the Smc5/6 complex ; together , they cooperate during recombinational DNA repair . Yet how the activity of the SUMO ligase is controlled remains unknown . Here we show that the SUMO ligase and the chromosome disjunction functions of Mms21 depend on its docking to an intact and active Smc5/6 complex , indicating that the Smc5/6-Mms21 complex operates as a large SUMO ligase in vivo . In spite of the physical distance separating the E3 and the nucleotide-binding domains in Smc5/6 , Mms21-dependent sumoylation requires binding of ATP to Smc5 , a step that is part of the ligase mechanism that assists Ubc9 function . The communication is enabled by the presence of a conserved disruption in the coiled coil domain of Smc5 , pointing to potential conformational changes for SUMO ligase activation . In accordance , scanning force microscopy of the Smc5-Mms21 heterodimer shows that the molecule is physically remodeled in an ATP-dependent manner . Our results demonstrate that the ATP-binding activity of the Smc5/6 complex is coordinated with its SUMO ligase , through the coiled coil domain of Smc5 and the physical remodeling of the molecule , to promote sumoylation and chromosome disjunction during DNA repair .

212,"Importance Although non – vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants ( NOACs ) are increasingly used to prevent thromboembolic disease , there are limited data on NOAC-related intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) . Objective To assess the association between preceding oral anticoagulant use ( warfarin , NOACs , and no oral anticoagulants [ OACs ] ) and in-hospital mortality among patients with ICH . Design , Setting , and Participants Retrospective cohort study of 141 311 patients with ICH admitted from October 2013 to December 2016 to 1662 Get With The Guidelines – Stroke hospitals . Exposures Anticoagulation therapy before ICH , defined as any use of OACs within 7 days prior to hospital arrival . Main Outcomes and Measures In-hospital mortality . Results Among 141 311 patients with ICH ( mean [ SD ] age , 68.3 [ 15.3 ] years ; 48.1 % women ) , 15 036 ( 10.6 % ) were taking warfarin and 4918 ( 3.5 % ) were taking NOACs preceding ICH , and 39 585 ( 28.0 % ) and 5783 ( 4.1 % ) were taking concomitant single and dual antiplatelet agents , respectively . Patients with prior use of warfarin or NOACs were older and had higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation and prior stroke . Acute ICH stroke severity ( measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ) was not significantly different across the 3 groups ( median , 9 [ interquartile range , 2 - 21 ] for warfarin , 8 [ 2 - 20 ] for NOACs , and 8 [ 2 - 19 ] for no OACs ) . The unadjusted in-hospital mortality rates were 32.6 % for warfarin , 26.5 % for NOACs , and 22.5 % for no OACs . Compared with patients without prior use of OACs , the risk of in-hospital mortality was higher among patients with prior use of warfarin ( adjusted risk difference [ ARD ] , 9.0 % [ 97.5 % CI , 7.9 % to 10.1 % ] ; adjusted odds ratio [ AOR ] , 1.62 [ 97.5 % CI , 1.53 to 1.71 ] ) and higher among patients with prior use of NOACs ( ARD , 3.3 % [ 97.5 % CI , 1.7 % to 4.8 % ] ; AOR , 1.21 [ 97.5 % CI , 1.11 - 1.32 ] ) . Compared with patients with prior use of warfarin , patients with prior use of NOACs had a lower risk of in-hospital mortality ( ARD , −5.7 % [ 97.5 % CI , −7.3 % to −4.2 % ] ; AOR , 0.75 [ 97.5 % CI , 0.69 to 0.81 ] ) . The difference in mortality between NOAC-treated patients and warfarin-treated patients was numerically greater among patients with prior use of dual antiplatelet agents ( 32.7 % vs 47.1 % ; ARD , −15.0 % [ 95.5 % CI , −26.3 % to −3.8 % ] ; AOR , 0.50 [ 97.5 % CI , 0.29 to 0.86 ] ) than among those taking these agents without prior antiplatelet therapy ( 26.4 % vs 31.7 % ; ARD , −5.0 % [ 97.5 % CI , −6.8 % to −3.2 % ] ; AOR , 0.77 [ 97.5 % CI , 0.70 to 0.85 ] ) , although the interaction P value ( .07 ) was not statistically significant .

213,"OBJECTIVE To determine whether there are risk factors in a doctor 's time at medical school that are associated with subsequent professional misconduct . DESIGN Matched case-control study . Setting Records from medical schools and the General Medical Council ( GMC ) . PARTICIPANTS 59 doctors who had graduated from any one of eight medical schools in the United Kingdom in 1958 - 97 and had a proved finding of serious professional misconduct in GMC proceedings in 1999 - 2004 ( cases ) ; 236 controls ( four for each case ) were selected by systematic sampling from matching graduation cohorts . Case-control status was revealed by the GMC after completion of data entry . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Odds ratios for being a "" case , "" with multivariable conditional logistic regression of potential risk factors including pre-admission characteristics and progress during the course . These data were obtained from anonymised copies of the students ' progress files held by their original medical schools . RESULTS Univariate conditional logistic regression analysis found that cases were more likely to be men , to be of lower estimated social class , and to have had academic difficulties during their medical course , especially in the early years . Multivariable analysis showed that male sex ( odds ratio 9.80 , 95 % confidence interval 2.43 to 39.44 , P=0.001 ) , lower social class ( 4.28 , 1.52 to 12.09 , P=0.006 ) , and failure of early or preclinical examinations ( 5.47 , 2.17 to 13.79 , P<0.001 ) were independently associated with being a case . CONCLUSIONS This small study suggests that male sex , a lower socioeconomic background , and early academic difficulties at medical school could be risk factors for subsequent professional misconduct .

214,"OBJECTIVE To determine whether there are risk factors in a doctor 's time at medical school that are associated with subsequent professional misconduct . DESIGN Matched case-control study . Setting Records from medical schools and the General Medical Council ( GMC ) . PARTICIPANTS 59 doctors who had graduated from any one of eight medical schools in the United Kingdom in 1958 - 97 and had a proved finding of serious professional misconduct in GMC proceedings in 1999 - 2004 ( cases ) ; 236 controls ( four for each case ) were selected by systematic sampling from matching graduation cohorts . Case-control status was revealed by the GMC after completion of data entry . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Odds ratios for being a "" case , "" with multivariable conditional logistic regression of potential risk factors including pre-admission characteristics and progress during the course . These data were obtained from anonymised copies of the students ' progress files held by their original medical schools . RESULTS Univariate conditional logistic regression analysis found that cases were more likely to be men , to be of lower estimated social class , and to have had academic difficulties during their medical course , especially in the early years . Multivariable analysis showed that male sex ( odds ratio 9.80 , 95 % confidence interval 2.43 to 39.44 , P=0.001 ) , lower social class ( 4.28 , 1.52 to 12.09 , P=0.006 ) , and failure of early or preclinical examinations ( 5.47 , 2.17 to 13.79 , P<0.001 ) were independently associated with being a case . CONCLUSIONS This small study suggests that male sex , a lower socioeconomic background , and early academic difficulties at medical school could be risk factors for subsequent professional misconduct . The findings are preliminary and should be interpreted with caution . Most doctors with risk factors will not come before the GMC 's disciplinary panels .

215,"BACKGROUND Direct recordings from peripheral sympathetic nerves have shown an increased sympathetic drive in pregnancy-induced hypertension ( PIH ) and preeclampsia ( PE ) . It is unknown whether sympathetic drive is altered in normal pregnancy , when arterial blood pressure can be normal or relatively low . The aim of this study was to measure and compare peripheral sympathetic discharge , its vasoconstrictor effect and its baroreceptor control , during pregnancy and postpartum in women with normal pregnancy ( NP ) and PIH and in normotensive nonpregnant ( NN ) women . METHODS AND RESULTS Twenty-one women with NP , 18 women with PIH , and 21 NN women had muscle sympathetic nerve activity assessed from multiunit discharges ( MSNA ) and from single units with defined vasoconstrictor properties ( s-MSNA ) . The s-MSNA in NP ( 38+/-6.6 impulses/100 beats ) was greater ( P<0.05 ) than in NN women ( 19+/-1.8 impulses/100 beats ) despite similar age and body weight but less than in PIH women ( P<0.001 ) ( 146+/-23.5 impulses/100 beats ) . MSNA followed a similar trend . Cardiac baroreceptor reflex sensitivity ( BRS ) was impaired in NP and PIH women relative to NN . After delivery , sympathetic activity decreased to values similar to those obtained in NN , and there was an increase in BRS . In women with NP , the decrease in sympathetic output occurred despite an insignificant change in blood pressure . CONCLUSIONS Central sympathetic output was increased in women with normal pregnancy and was even greater in the hypertensive pregnant group . The findings suggest that the moderate sympathetic hyperactivity during the latter months of normal pregnancy may help to return the arterial pressure to nonpregnant levels , although when the increase in activity is excessive , hypertension may ensue . Baseline neurovascular transduction is reduced in normotensive pregnancy ; however , little is known about changes to neurovascular transduction during periods of heightened sympathetic activation . We tested the hypothesis that , despite an exacerbated muscle sympathetic nerve activity ( microneurography ) response to cold pressor stimulation , the blunting of neurovascular transduction in normotensive pregnant women would result in similar changes in vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure ( Finometer ) relative to nonpregnant controls . Baseline neurovascular transduction was reduced in pregnant women relative to controls when expressed as the quotient of both total resistance and mean arterial pressure and sympathetic burst frequency ( 0.32±0.07 versus 0.58±0.16 mm Hg/L/min/bursts/min , P<0.001 and 2.4±0.7 versus 3.6±0.8 mm Hg/bursts/min , P=0.001 ) . Sympathetic activation was greater across all 3 minutes of cold pressor stimulation in the pregnant women relative to the nonpregnant controls . Peak sympathoexcitation was also greater in pregnant than in nonpregnant women , whether expressed as sympathetic burst frequency ( + 17±13 versus + 7±8 bursts/min , P=0.049 ) , burst incidence ( + 17±9 versus + 6±11 bursts/100 hb , P=0.03 ) , or total activity ( + 950±660 versus + 363±414 arbitrary units , P=0.04 ) . However , neurovascular transduction during peak cold pressor-induced sympathoexcitation remained blunted in pregnant women ( 0.25±0.11 versus 0.45±0.08 mm Hg/L/min/bursts/min , P<0.001 and 1.9±1.0 versus 3.2±0.9 mm Hg/bursts/min , P=0.006 ) . Therefore , mean arterial pressure ( 93±21 versus 99±6 mm Hg , P=0.4 ) and total peripheral resistance ( 12±3 versus 14±3 mm Hg/L/min ) were not different between pregnant and nonpregnant women during peak sympathoexcitation . These data indicate that the third trimester of normotensive pregnancy is associated with reductions in neurovascular transduction , which result in the dissociation of sympathetic outflow from hemodynamic outcomes , even during cold pressor-induced sympathoexcitation . Muscle sympathetic nerve activity is increased during normotensive pregnancy while mean arterial pressure is maintained or reduced , suggesting baroreflex resetting . We hypothesized spontaneous sympathetic baroreflex gain would be reduced in normotensive pregnant women relative to nonpregnant matched controls . Integrated muscle sympathetic burst incidence and total sympathetic activity ( microneurography ) , blood pressure ( Finometer ) , and R-R interval ( ECG ) were assessed at rest in 11 pregnant women ( 33 ± 1 wk gestation , 31 ± 1 yr , prepregnancy BMI : 23.5 ± 0.9 kg/m(2 ) ) and 11 nonpregnant controls ( 29 ± 1 yr ; BMI : 25.2 ± 1.7 kg/m(2 ) ) . Pregnant women had elevated baseline sympathetic burst incidence ( 43 ± 2 vs. 33 ± 2 bursts/100 heart beats , P = 0.01 ) and total sympathetic activity ( 1,811 ± 148 vs. 1,140 ± 55 au , P < 0.01 ) relative to controls . Both mean ( 88 ± 3 vs. 91 ± 2 mmHg , P = 0.4 ) and diastolic ( DBP ) ( 72 ± 3 vs. 73 ± 2 mmHg , P = 0.7 ) pressures were similar between pregnant and nonpregnant women , respectively , indicating an upward resetting of the baroreflex set point with pregnancy . Baroreflex gain , calculated as the linear relationship between sympathetic burst incidence and DBP , was reduced in pregnant women relative to controls ( -3.7 ± 0.5 vs. -5.4 ± 0.5 bursts·100 heart beats(-1)·mmHg(-1 ) , P = 0.03 ) , as was baroreflex gain calculated with total sympathetic activity ( -294 ± 24 vs. -210 ± 24 au·100 heart beats(-1)·mmHg(-1 ) ; P = 0.03 ) . Cardiovagal baroreflex gain ( sequence method ) was not different between nonpregnant controls and pregnant women ( 49 ± 8 vs. 36 ± 8 ms/mmHg ; P = 0.2 ) . However , sympathetic ( burst incidence ) and cardiovagal gains were negatively correlated in pregnant women ( R = -0.7 ; P = 0.02 ) . Together , these data indicate that the influence of the sympathetic nervous system over arterial blood pressure is reduced in normotensive pregnancy , in terms of both long-term and beat-to-beat regulation of arterial pressure , likely through a baroreceptor-dependent mechanism .

Pregnant women had elevated baseline sympathetic burst incidence ( 43 ± 2 vs. 33 ± 2 bursts/100 heart beats , P = 0.01 ) and total sympathetic activity ( 1,811 ± 148 vs. 1,140 ± 55 au , P < 0.01 ) relative to controls . Both mean ( 88 ± 3 vs. 91 ± 2 mmHg , P = 0.4 ) and diastolic ( DBP ) ( 72 ± 3 vs. 73 ± 2 mmHg , P = 0.7 ) pressures were similar between pregnant and nonpregnant women , respectively , indicating an upward resetting of the baroreflex set point with pregnancy . Baroreflex gain , calculated as the linear relationship between sympathetic burst incidence and DBP , was reduced in pregnant women relative to controls ( -3.7 ± 0.5 vs. -5.4 ± 0.5 bursts·100 heart beats(-1)·mmHg(-1 ) , P = 0.03 ) , as was baroreflex gain calculated with total sympathetic activity ( -294 ± 24 vs. -210 ± 24 au·100 heart beats(-1)·mmHg(-1 ) ; P = 0.03 ) . Cardiovagal baroreflex gain ( sequence method ) was not different between nonpregnant controls and pregnant women ( 49 ± 8 vs. 36 ± 8 ms/mmHg ; P = 0.2 ) . However , sympathetic ( burst incidence ) and cardiovagal gains were negatively correlated in pregnant women ( R = -0.7 ; P = 0.02 ) . Together , these data indicate that the influence of the sympathetic nervous system over arterial blood pressure is reduced in normotensive pregnancy , in terms of both long-term and beat-to-beat regulation of arterial pressure , likely through a baroreceptor-dependent mechanism .

217,"CONTEXT Whether immunosuppressive treatment adversely affects survival is unclear . OBJECTIVE To assess whether immunosuppressive drugs increase mortality . DESIGN Retrospective cohort study evaluating overall and cancer mortality in relation to immunosuppressive drug exposure among patients with ocular inflammatory diseases . Demographic , clinical , and treatment data derived from medical records , and mortality results from United States National Death Index linkage . The cohort 's mortality risk was compared with US vital statistics using standardised mortality ratios . Overall and cancer mortality in relation to use or non-use of immunosuppressive drugs within the cohort was studied with survival analysis . SETTING Five tertiary ocular inflammation clinics . Patients 7957 US residents with non-infectious ocular inflammation , 2340 of whom received immunosuppressive drugs during follow up . Exposures Use of antimetabolites , T cell inhibitors , alkylating agents , and tumour necrosis factor inhibitors . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Overall mortality , cancer mortality . RESULTS Over 66 802 person years ( 17 316 after exposure to immunosuppressive drugs ) , 936 patients died ( 1.4/100 person years ) , 230 ( 24.6 % ) from cancer . For patients unexposed to immunosuppressive treatment , risks of death overall ( standardised mortality ratio 1.02 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.94 to 1.11 ) and from cancer ( 1.10 , 0.93 to 1.29 ) were similar to those of the US population . Patients who used azathioprine , methotrexate , mycophenolate mofetil , ciclosporin , systemic corticosteroids , or dapsone had overall and cancer mortality similar to that of patients who never took immunosuppressive drugs . In patients who used cyclophosphamide , overall mortality was not increased and cancer mortality was non-significantly increased . Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors were associated with increased overall ( adjusted hazard ratio [ HR ] 1.99 , 95 % CI 1.00 to 3.98 ) and cancer mortality ( adjusted HR 3.83 , 1.13 to 13.01 ) .

218,"Glioblastomas are deadly cancers that display a functional cellular hierarchy maintained by self-renewing glioblastoma stem cells ( GSCs ) . GSCs are regulated by molecular pathways distinct from the bulk tumor that may be useful therapeutic targets . We determined that A20 ( TNFAIP3 ) , a regulator of cell survival and the NF-kappaB pathway , is overexpressed in GSCs relative to non-stem glioblastoma cells at both the mRNA and protein levels . To determine the functional significance of A20 in GSCs , we targeted A20 expression with lentiviral-mediated delivery of short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) . Inhibiting A20 expression decreased GSC growth and survival through mechanisms associated with decreased cell-cycle progression and decreased phosphorylation of p65/RelA. Elevated levels of A20 in GSCs contributed to apoptotic resistance : GSCs were less susceptible to TNFalpha-induced cell death than matched non-stem glioma cells , but A20 knockdown sensitized GSCs to TNFalpha-mediated apoptosis . The decreased survival of GSCs upon A20 knockdown contributed to the reduced ability of these cells to self-renew in primary and secondary neurosphere formation assays . The tumorigenic potential of GSCs was decreased with A20 targeting , resulting in increased survival of mice bearing human glioma xenografts . In silico analysis of a glioma patient genomic database indicates that A20 overexpression and amplification is inversely correlated with survival . Together these data indicate that A20 contributes to glioma maintenance through effects on the glioma stem cell subpopulation . Although inactivating mutations in A20 in lymphoma suggest A20 can act as a tumor suppressor , similar point mutations have not been identified through glioma genomic sequencing : in fact , our data suggest A20 may function as a tumor enhancer in glioma through promotion of GSC survival . A20 anticancer therapies should therefore be viewed with caution as effects will likely differ depending on the tumor type .

219,"CONTEXT Many individuals take vitamins in the hopes of preventing chronic diseases such as cancer , and vitamins E and C are among the most common individual supplements . A large-scale randomized trial suggested that vitamin E may reduce risk of prostate cancer ; however , few trials have been powered to address this relationship . No previous trial in men at usual risk has examined vitamin C alone in the prevention of cancer . OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether long-term vitamin E or C supplementation decreases risk of prostate and total cancer events among men . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS The Physicians ' Health Study II is a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled factorial trial of vitamins E and C that began in 1997 and continued until its scheduled completion on August 31 , 2007 . A total of 14,641 male physicians in the United States initially aged 50 years or older , including 1307 men with a history of prior cancer at randomization , were enrolled . INTERVENTION Individual supplements of 400 IU of vitamin E every other day and 500 mg of vitamin C daily . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Prostate and total cancer . RESULTS During a mean follow-up of 8.0 years , there were 1008 confirmed incident cases of prostate cancer and 1943 total cancers . Compared with placebo , vitamin E had no effect on the incidence of prostate cancer ( active and placebo vitamin E groups , 9.1 and 9.5 events per 1000 person-years ; hazard ratio [ HR ] , 0.97 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.85 - 1.09 ; P = .58 ) or total cancer ( active and placebo vitamin E groups , 17.8 and 17.3 cases per 1000 person-years ; HR , 1.04 ; 95 % CI , 0.95 - 1.13 ; P = .41 ) . There was also no significant effect of vitamin C on total cancer ( active and placebo vitamin C groups , 17.6 and 17.5 events per 1000 person-years ; HR , 1.01 ; 95 % CI , 0.92 - 1.10 ; P = .86 ) or prostate cancer ( active and placebo vitamin C groups , 9.4 and 9.2 cases per 1000 person-years ; HR , 1.02 ; 95 % CI , 0.90 - 1.15 ; P = .80 ) . Neither vitamin E nor vitamin C had a significant effect on colorectal , lung , or other site-specific cancers . Adjustment for adherence and exclusion of the first 4 or 6 years of follow-up did not alter the results . Stratification by various cancer risk factors demonstrated no significant modification of the effect of vitamin E on prostate cancer risk or either agent on total cancer risk .

220,"Serotonin signaling suppresses generation of amyloid-β ( Aβ ) in vitro and in animal models of Alzheimer ’s disease ( AD ) . We show that in an aged transgenic AD mouse model ( APP/PS1 plaque-bearing mice ) , the antidepressant citalopram , a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , decreased Aβ in brain interstitial fluid in a dose-dependent manner . Growth of individual amyloid plaques was assessed in plaque-bearing mice that were chronically administered citalopram . Citalopram arrested the growth of preexisting plaques and reduced the appearance of new plaques by 78 % . In healthy human volunteers , citalopram ’s effects on Aβ production and Aβ concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) were measured prospectively using stable isotope labeling kinetics , with CSF sampling during acute dosing of citalopram . Aβ production in CSF was slowed by 37 % in the citalopram group compared to placebo . This change was associated with a 38 % decrease in total CSF Aβ concentrations in the drug-treated group . The ability to safely decrease Aβ concentrations is potentially important as a preventive strategy for AD . This study demonstrates key target engagement for future AD prevention trials .

221,"BACKGROUND Taxing sugar-sweetened beverages ( SSBs ) has been proposed in high-income countries to reduce obesity and type 2 diabetes . We sought to estimate the potential health effects of such a fiscal strategy in the middle-income country of India , where there is heterogeneity in SSB consumption , patterns of substitution between SSBs and other beverages after tax increases , and vast differences in chronic disease risk within the population . METHODS AND FINDINGS Using consumption and price variations data from a nationally representative survey of 100,855 Indian households , we first calculated how changes in SSB price alter per capita consumption of SSBs and substitution with other beverages . We then incorporated SSB sales trends , body mass index ( BMI ) , and diabetes incidence data stratified by age , sex , income , and urban/rural residence into a validated microsimulation of caloric consumption , glycemic load , overweight/obesity prevalence , and type 2 diabetes incidence among Indian subpopulations facing a 20 % SSB excise tax . The 20 % SSB tax was anticipated to reduce overweight and obesity prevalence by 3.0 % ( 95 % CI 1.6%-5.9 % ) and type 2 diabetes incidence by 1.6 % ( 95 % CI 1.2%-1.9 % ) among various Indian subpopulations over the period 2014 - 2023 , if SSB consumption continued to increase linearly in accordance with secular trends . However , acceleration in SSB consumption trends consistent with industry marketing models would be expected to increase the impact efficacy of taxation , averting 4.2 % of prevalent overweight/obesity ( 95 % CI 2.5 - 10.0 % ) and 2.5 % ( 95 % CI 1.0 - 2.8 % ) of incident type 2 diabetes from 2014 - 2023 . Given current consumption and BMI distributions , our results suggest the largest relative effect would be expected among young rural men , refuting our a priori hypothesis that urban populations would be isolated beneficiaries of SSB taxation . Key limitations of this estimation approach include the assumption that consumer expenditure behavior from prior years , captured in price elasticities , will reflect future behavior among consumers , and potential underreporting of consumption in dietary recall data used to inform our calculations . CONCLUSION Sustained SSB taxation at a high tax rate could mitigate rising obesity and type 2 diabetes in India among both urban and rural subpopulations .

222,"To initiate adaptive immunity , dendritic cells ( DCs ) move from parenchymal tissues to lymphoid organs by migrating along stromal scaffolds that display the glycoprotein podoplanin ( PDPN ) . PDPN is expressed by lymphatic endothelial and fibroblastic reticular cells and promotes blood-lymph separation during development by activating the C-type lectin receptor , CLEC-2 , on platelets . Here , we describe a role for CLEC-2 in the morphodynamic behavior and motility of DCs . CLEC-2 deficiency in DCs impaired their entry into lymphatics and trafficking to and within lymph nodes , thereby reducing T cell priming . CLEC-2 engagement of PDPN was necessary for DCs to spread and migrate along stromal surfaces and sufficient to induce membrane protrusions . CLEC-2 activation triggered cell spreading via downregulation of RhoA activity and myosin light-chain phosphorylation and triggered F-actin-rich protrusions via Vav signaling and Rac1 activation . Thus , activation of CLEC-2 by PDPN rearranges the actin cytoskeleton in DCs to promote efficient motility along stromal surfaces .

Here , we used theoretical considerations and experimental models of immune responses in vitro and in vivo to quantify the spatial extent of cytokine communications in dense tissues .

The size of these self‐assembled niches scaled with the density of cytokine‐consuming cells , a parameter that gets tuned during immune responses . In vivo , we measured interactions on length scales of 80–120 & mgr;m , which resulted in a high degree of cell‐to‐cell variance in cytokine exposure .

Quantitatively partitioning the relative roles of these effects through time is challenging . Using data from rodent malaria , we estimated the effective propagation number , which reflects the relative importance of contrasting within-host control mechanisms through time and is sensitive to the inoculating parasite dose . Our analysis showed that the capacity of innate responses to restrict initial parasite growth saturates with parasite dose and that experimentally enhanced innate immunity can affect parasite density indirectly via resource depletion .

234,"OBJECTIVE To determine rates of suicide associated with pregnancy by the type of pregnancy . DESIGN Register linkage study . Information on suicides in women of reproductive age was linked with the Finnish birth , abortion , and hospital discharge registers to find out how many women who committed suicide had had a completed pregnancy during her last year of life . SETTING Nationwide data from Finland . SUBJECTS Women who committed suicide in 1987 - 94 . RESULTS There were 73 suicides associated with pregnancy , representing 5.4 % of all suicides in women in this age group . The mean annual suicide rate was 11.3 per 100,000 . The suicide rate associated with birth was significantly lower ( 5.9 ) and the rates associated with miscarriage ( 18.1 ) and induced abortion ( 34.7 ) were significantly higher than in the population . The risk associated with birth was higher among teenagers and that associated with abortion was increased in all age groups . Women who had committed a suicide tended to come from lower social classes and were more likely to be unmarried than other women who had had a completed pregnancy . CONCLUSIONS The increased risk of suicide after an induced abortion indicates either common risk factors for both or harmful effects of induced abortion on mental health .

235,"Turnover of integrin-based focal adhesions ( FAs ) with the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) is essential for coordinated cell movement . In collectively migrating human keratinocytes , FAs assemble near the leading edge , grow and mature as a result of contractile forces and disassemble underneath the advancing cell body . We report that clustering of microtubule-associated CLASP1 and CLASP2 proteins around FAs temporally correlates with FA turnover . CLASPs and LL5β ( also known as PHLDB2 ) , which recruits CLASPs to FAs , facilitate FA disassembly . CLASPs are further required for FA-associated ECM degradation , and matrix metalloprotease inhibition slows FA disassembly similarly to CLASP or PHLDB2 ( LL5β ) depletion . Finally , CLASP-mediated microtubule tethering at FAs establishes an FA-directed transport pathway for delivery , docking and localized fusion of exocytic vesicles near FAs . We propose that CLASPs couple microtubule organization , vesicle transport and cell interactions with the ECM , establishing a local secretion pathway that facilitates FA turnover by severing cell-matrix connections .

236,"The clinical course and eventual outcome , or prognosis , of complex diseases varies enormously between affected individuals . This variability critically determines the impact a disease has on a patient 's life but is very poorly understood . Here , we exploit existing genome-wide association study data to gain insight into the role of genetics in prognosis . We identify a noncoding polymorphism in FOXO3A ( rs12212067 : T > G ) at which the minor ( G ) allele , despite not being associated with disease susceptibility , is associated with a milder course of Crohn 's disease and rheumatoid arthritis and with increased risk of severe malaria . Minor allele carriage is shown to limit inflammatory responses in monocytes via a FOXO3-driven pathway , which through TGFβ1 reduces production of proinflammatory cytokines , including TNFα , and increases production of anti-inflammatory cytokines , including IL-10 .

239,"The functional heart is comprised of distinct mesoderm-derived lineages including cardiomyocytes , endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells . Studies in the mouse embryo and the mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation model have provided evidence indicating that these three lineages develop from a common Flk-1 + ( kinase insert domain protein receptor , also known as Kdr ) cardiovascular progenitor that represents one of the earliest stages in mesoderm specification to the cardiovascular lineages . To determine whether a comparable progenitor is present during human cardiogenesis , we analysed the development of the cardiovascular lineages in human embryonic stem cell differentiation cultures . Here we show that after induction with combinations of activin A , bone morphogenetic protein 4 ( BMP4 ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF , also known as FGF2 ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF , also known as VEGFA ) and dickkopf homolog 1 ( DKK1 ) in serum-free media , human embryonic-stem-cell-derived embryoid bodies generate a KDRlow/C-KIT(CD117)neg population that displays cardiac , endothelial and vascular smooth muscle potential in vitro and , after transplantation , in vivo . When plated in monolayer cultures , these KDRlow/C-KITneg cells differentiate to generate populations consisting of greater than 50 % contracting cardiomyocytes . Populations derived from the KDRlow/C-KITneg fraction give rise to colonies that contain all three lineages when plated in methylcellulose cultures . Results from limiting dilution studies and cell-mixing experiments support the interpretation that these colonies are clones , indicating that they develop from a cardiovascular colony-forming cell . Together , these findings identify a human cardiovascular progenitor that defines one of the earliest stages of human cardiac development .

244,"CONTEXT The growth inhibitory effect of tamoxifen , which is used for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer , is mediated by its metabolites , 4-hydroxytamoxifen and endoxifen . The formation of active metabolites is catalyzed by the polymorphic cytochrome P450 2D6 ( CYP2D6 ) enzyme . OBJECTIVE To determine whether CYP2D6 variation is associated with clinical outcomes in women receiving adjuvant tamoxifen . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PATIENTS Retrospective analysis of German and US cohorts of patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen for early stage breast cancer . The 1325 patients had diagnoses between 1986 and 2005 of stage I through III breast cancer and were mainly postmenopausal ( 95.4 % ) . Last follow-up was in December 2008 ; inclusion criteria were hormone receptor positivity , no metastatic disease at diagnosis , adjuvant tamoxifen therapy , and no chemotherapy . DNA from tumor tissue or blood was genotyped for CYP2D6 variants associated with reduced ( * 10 , * 41 ) or absent ( * 3 , * 4 , * 5 ) enzyme activity . Women were classified as having an extensive ( n=609 ) , heterozygous extensive/intermediate ( n=637 ) , or poor ( n=79 ) CYP2D6 metabolism . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Time to recurrence , event-free survival , disease-free survival , and overall survival . RESULTS Median follow-up was 6.3 years . At 9 years of follow-up , the recurrence rates were 14.9 % for extensive metabolizers , 20.9 % for heterozygous extensive/intermediate metabolizers , and 29.0 % for poor metabolizers , and all-cause mortality rates were 16.7 % , 18.0 % , and 22.8 % , respectively . Compared with extensive metabolizers , there was a significantly increased risk of recurrence for heterozygous extensive/intermediate metabolizers ( time to recurrence adjusted hazard ratio [ HR ] , 1.40 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.04 - 1.90 ) and for poor metabolizers ( time to recurrence HR , 1.90 ; 95 % CI , 1.10 - 3.28 ) . Compared with extensive metabolizers , those with decreased CYP2D6 activity ( heterozygous extensive/intermediate and poor metabolism ) had worse event-free survival ( HR , 1.33 ; 95 % CI , 1.06 - 1.68 ) and disease-free survival ( HR , 1.29 ; 95 % CI , 1.03 - 1.61 ) , but there was no significant difference in overall survival ( HR , 1.15 ; 95 % CI , 0.88 - 1.51 ) . CONCLUSION Among women with breast cancer treated with tamoxifen , there was an association between CYP2D6 variation and clinical outcomes , such that the presence of 2 functional CYP2D6 alleles was associated with better clinical outcomes and the presence of nonfunctional or reduced-function alleles with worse outcomes .

246,"CONTEXT During pregnancy , serum levels of estrogen , progesterone , and other hormones are markedly higher than during other periods of life . Pregnancy hormones primarily are produced in the placenta , and signs of placental impairment may serve as indirect markers of hormone exposures during pregnancy . During pregnancy , these markers have been inconsistently associated with subsequent risk of breast cancer in the mother . OBJECTIVE To examine associations between indirect markers of hormonal exposures , such as placental weight and other pregnancy characteristics , and maternal risk of developing breast cancer . DESIGN AND SETTING Population-based cohort study using data from the Swedish Birth Register , the Swedish Cancer Register , the Swedish Cause of Death Register , and the Swedish Register of Population and Population Changes . PARTICIPANTS Women included in the Sweden Birth Register who delivered singletons between 1982 and 1989 , with complete information on date of birth and gestational age . Women were followed up until the occurrence of breast cancer , death , or end of follow-up ( December 31 , 2001 ) . Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate associations between hormone exposures and risks of breast cancer . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Incidence of invasive breast cancer . RESULTS Of 314,019 women in the cohort , 2216 ( 0.7 % ) developed breast cancer during the follow-up through 2001 , of whom 2100 ( 95 % ) were diagnosed before age 50 years . Compared with women who had placentas weighing less than 500 g in 2 consecutive pregnancies , the risk of breast cancer was increased among women whose placentas weighed between 500 and 699 g in their first pregnancy and at least 700 g in their second pregnancy ( or vice versa ) ( adjusted hazard ratio , 1.82 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.07 - 3.08 ) , and the corresponding risk was doubled among women whose placentas weighed at least 700 g in both pregnancies ( adjusted hazard ratio , 2.05 ; 95 % CI , 1.15 - 3.64 ) . A high birth weight ( > or = 4000 g ) in 2 successive births was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer before but not after adjusting for placental weight and other covariates ( adjusted hazard ratio , 1.10 ; 95 % CI , 0.76 - 1.59 ) .

247,"Summary Background Alcohol use is a leading risk factor for death and disability , but its overall association with health remains complex given the possible protective effects of moderate alcohol consumption on some conditions . With our comprehensive approach to health accounting within the Global Burden of Diseases , Injuries , and Risk Factors Study 2016 , we generated improved estimates of alcohol use and alcohol-attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life-years ( DALYs ) for 195 locations from 1990 to 2016 , for both sexes and for 5-year age groups between the ages of 15 years and 95 years and older . Methods Using 694 data sources of individual and population-level alcohol consumption , along with 592 prospective and retrospective studies on the risk of alcohol use , we produced estimates of the prevalence of current drinking , abstention , the distribution of alcohol consumption among current drinkers in standard drinks daily ( defined as 10 g of pure ethyl alcohol ) , and alcohol-attributable deaths and DALYs . We made several methodological improvements compared with previous estimates : first , we adjusted alcohol sales estimates to take into account tourist and unrecorded consumption ; second , we did a new meta-analysis of relative risks for 23 health outcomes associated with alcohol use ; and third , we developed a new method to quantify the level of alcohol consumption that minimises the overall risk to individual health . Findings Globally , alcohol use was the seventh leading risk factor for both deaths and DALYs in 2016 , accounting for 2·2 % ( 95 % uncertainty interval [ UI ] 1·5–3·0 ) of age-standardised female deaths and 6·8 % ( 5·8–8·0 ) of age-standardised male deaths . Among the population aged 15–49 years , alcohol use was the leading risk factor globally in 2016 , with 3·8 % ( 95 % UI 3·2–4·3 ) of female deaths and 12·2 % ( 10·8–13·6 ) of male deaths attributable to alcohol use . For the population aged 15–49 years , female attributable DALYs were 2·3 % ( 95 % UI 2·0–2·6 ) and male attributable DALYs were 8·9 % ( 7·8–9·9 ) . The three leading causes of attributable deaths in this age group were tuberculosis ( 1·4 % [ 95 % UI 1·0–1·7 ] of total deaths ) , road injuries ( 1·2 % [ 0·7–1·9 ] ) , and self-harm ( 1·1 % [ 0·6–1·5 ] ) . For populations aged 50 years and older , cancers accounted for a large proportion of total alcohol-attributable deaths in 2016 , constituting 27·1 % ( 95 % UI 21·2–33·3 ) of total alcohol-attributable female deaths and 18·9 % ( 15·3–22·6 ) of male deaths . The level of alcohol consumption that minimised harm across health outcomes was zero ( 95 % UI 0·0–0·8 ) standard drinks per week . Interpretation Alcohol use is a leading risk factor for global disease burden and causes substantial health loss . We found that the risk of all-cause mortality , and of cancers specifically , rises with increasing levels of consumption , and the level of consumption that minimises health loss is zero . These results suggest that alcohol control policies might need to be revised worldwide , refocusing on efforts to lower overall population-level consumption .

248,"BACKGROUND Self-harm and suicide are common in prisoners , yet robust information on the full extent and characteristics of people at risk of self-harm is scant . Furthermore , understanding how frequently self-harm is followed by suicide , and in which prisoners this progression is most likely to happen , is important . We did a case-control study of all prisoners in England and Wales to ascertain the prevalence of self-harm in this population , associated risk factors , clustering effects , and risk of subsequent suicide after self-harm . METHODS Records of self-harm incidents in all prisons in England and Wales were gathered routinely between January , 2004 , and December , 2009 . We did a case-control comparison of prisoners who self-harmed and those who did not between January , 2006 , and December , 2009 . We also used a Bayesian approach to look at clustering of people who self-harmed . Prisoners who self-harmed and subsequently died by suicide in prison were compared with other inmates who self-harmed . FINDINGS 139,195 self-harm incidents were recorded in 26,510 individual prisoners between 2004 and 2009 ; 5 - 6 % of male prisoners and 20 - 24 % of female inmates self-harmed every year . Self-harm rates were more than ten times higher in female prisoners than in male inmates . Repetition of self-harm was common , particularly in women and teenage girls , in whom a subgroup of 102 prisoners accounted for 17,307 episodes . In both sexes , self-harm was associated with younger age , white ethnic origin , prison type , and a life sentence or being unsentenced ; in female inmates , committing a violent offence against an individual was also a factor . Substantial evidence was noted of clustering in time and location of prisoners who self-harmed ( adjusted intra-class correlation 0·15 , 95 % CI 0·11 - 0·18 ) . 109 subsequent suicides in prison were reported in individuals who self-harmed ; the risk was higher in those who self-harmed than in the general prison population , and more than half the deaths occurred within a month of self-harm . Risk factors for suicide after self-harm in male prisoners were older age and a previous self-harm incident of high or moderate lethality ; in female inmates , a history of more than five self-harm incidents within a year was associated with subsequent suicide . INTERPRETATION The burden of self-harm in prisoners is substantial , particularly in women . Self-harm in prison is associated with subsequent suicide in this setting . Prevention and treatment of self-harm in prisoners is an essential component of suicide prevention in prisons .

249,"Granulomas are the pathological hallmark of tuberculosis ( TB ) . However , their function and mechanisms of formation remain poorly understood . To understand the role of granulomas in TB , we analyzed the proteomes of granulomas from subjects with tuberculosis in an unbiased manner . Using laser-capture microdissection , mass spectrometry and confocal microscopy , we generated detailed molecular maps of human granulomas . We found that the centers of granulomas have a pro-inflammatory environment that is characterized by the presence of antimicrobial peptides , reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids . Conversely , the tissue surrounding the caseum has a comparatively anti-inflammatory signature . These findings are consistent across a set of six human subjects and in rabbits . Although the balance between systemic pro- and anti-inflammatory signals is crucial to TB disease outcome , here we find that these signals are physically segregated within each granuloma . From the protein and lipid snapshots of human and rabbit lesions analyzed here , we hypothesize that the pathologic response to TB is shaped by the precise anatomical localization of these inflammatory pathways during the development of the granuloma .

250,"CONTEXT Recent animal studies have found that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A ( HMG-CoA ) lipid-lowering drugs ( statins ) substantially increase bone formation , but whether statin use in humans results in clinically meaningful bone formation or a reduction in the risk of osteoporotic fractures is not known . OBJECTIVE To determine whether the use of statins is associated with reduced hip fracture risk . DESIGN Case-control study . SETTING AND PATIENTS A total of 6110 New Jersey residents aged 65 years or older and enrolled in Medicare and either Medicaid or the Pharmacy Assistance for the Aged and Disabled program . Case patients ( n=1222 ) underwent surgical repair of a hip fracture in 1994 . Control patients ( n=4888 ) were identified at a ratio of 4:1 and frequency-matched to case patients for age and sex . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) of hip fracture by statin use in the 180 days and 3 years prior to the index date ( the earliest date of admission for surgery ) , adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics and health care utilization . RESULTS Use of statins in either the prior 180 days ( adjusted OR , 0.50 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.33 - 0.76 ) or prior 3 years ( adjusted OR , 0.57 ; 95 % CI , 0.40 - 0.82 ) was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of hip fracture , even after controlling for variables such as race , insurance status , psychoactive medications , estrogen and thiazide use , ischemic heart disease , cancer , and diabetes mellitus . No significant relationship was observed between use of nonstatin lipid-lowering agents and hip fracture risk . Clear relationships were observed between the degree of reduction in hip fracture risk and the extent of statin use ; there was no evidence of such relationships with nonstatin lipid-lowering agents . After adjusting for extent of statin use in the prior 3 years , current use ( on the index date ) was associated with a 71 % reduction in risk ( adjusted OR , 0.29 ; 95 % CI , 0.10 - 0.81 ) . The relationship between statin use and hip fracture risk persisted after controlling for variables such as the number of medications , the Charlson comorbidity index score , and hospitalization or nursing home stay in the last 180 days , as well as after excluding patients who were in a nursing home prior to their index date or who died in the year after their index date . Use of nonstatin lipid-lowering agents was not observed to be associated with reduction in hip fracture risk in any of these alternative models or analyses . CONCLUSIONS These findings support an association between statin use by elderly patients and reduction in the risk of hip fracture . Controlled trials are needed to exclude the possibility of unmeasured confounders .

251,"OBJECTIVE To assess the association between use of macrolide antibiotics in mothers and infants from pregnancy onset until 120 days after birth and infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis ( IHPS ) . DESIGN Nationwide register based cohort study . SETTING Denmark , 1996 - 2011 . PARTICIPANTS 999,378 liveborn singletons and linked individual level information on macrolide prescriptions ( maternal use during pregnancy , n=30,091 ; maternal use after birth , n=21,557 ; use in infants , n=6591 ) , surgery for IHPS , and potential confounders . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Surgery for IHPS by three categories of macrolide use : in mothers during pregnancy , in mothers after birth , and in infants after birth . RESULTS 880 infants developed IHPS ( 0.9 cases per 1000 births ) . Compared with infants with no use of macrolides , the adjusted rate ratio for IHPS in infants with use of macrolides during days 0 to 13 after birth was 29.8 ( 95 % confidence interval 16.4 to 54.1 ) and during days 14 to 120 was 3.24 ( 1.20 to 8.74 ) ; the corresponding absolute risk differences were 24.4 ( 95 % confidence interval 13.0 to 44.1 ) and 0.65 ( 0.06 to 2.21 ) cases per 1000 infants exposed to macrolides , respectively . The rate ratio for maternal use of macrolides for days 0 to 13 after birth was 3.49 ( 1.92 to 6.34 ) and for days 14 to 120 was 0.70 ( 0.26 to 1.90 ) ; the corresponding absolute risk differences were 2.15 ( 0.82 to 4.64 ) and -0.11 ( -0.26 to 0.31 ) . The rate ratios for maternal use of macrolides during pregnancy were 1.02 ( 0.65 to 1.59 ) for weeks 0 to 27 and 1.77 ( 0.95 to 3.31 ) for weeks 28 to birth ; the corresponding absolute risk differences were 0.01 ( -0.31 to 0.50 ) and 0.67 ( -0.06 to 2.02 ) . CONCLUSIONS Treatment of young infants with macrolide antibiotics was strongly associated with IHPS and should therefore only be administered if potential treatment benefits outweigh the risk . Maternal use of macrolides during the first two weeks after birth was also associated with an increased risk of IHPS . A possible association was also found with use during late pregnancy .

253,"Oct4 is a well-known transcription factor that plays fundamental roles in stem cell self-renewal , pluripotency , and somatic cell reprogramming . However , limited information is available on Oct4-associated protein complexes and their intrinsic protein-protein interactions that dictate Oct4 's critical regulatory activities . Here we employed an improved affinity purification approach combined with mass spectrometry to purify Oct4 protein complexes in mouse embryonic stem cells ( mESCs ) , and discovered many novel Oct4 partners important for self-renewal and pluripotency of mESCs . Notably , we found that Oct4 is associated with multiple chromatin-modifying complexes with documented as well as newly proved functional significance in stem cell maintenance and somatic cell reprogramming . Our study establishes a solid biochemical basis for genetic and epigenetic regulation of stem cell pluripotency and provides a framework for exploring alternative factor-based reprogramming strategies . Transcription factors , such as Oct4 , are critical for establishing and maintaining pluripotent cell identity . Whereas the genomic locations of several pluripotency transcription factors have been reported , the spectrum of their interaction partners is underexplored . Here , we use an improved affinity protocol to purify Oct4-interacting proteins from mouse embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) . Subsequent purification of Oct4 partners Sall4 , Tcfcp2l1 , Dax1 , and Esrrb resulted in an Oct4 interactome of 166 proteins , including transcription factors and chromatin-modifying complexes with documented roles in self-renewal , but also many factors not previously associated with the ESC network . We find that Esrrb associated with the basal transcription machinery and also detect interactions between transcription factors and components of the TGF-beta , Notch , and Wnt signaling pathways .

Understanding such tight control of host defense requires the elucidation of the transcription factors involved . By using an unbiased approach in the model Caenorhabditis elegans , we discovered that HLH-30 ( known as TFEB in mammals ) is a key transcription factor for host defense . HLH-30 was activated shortly after Staphylococcus aureus infection , and drove the expression of close to 80 % of the host response , including antimicrobial and autophagy genes that were essential for host tolerance of infection . TFEB was also rapidly activated in murine macrophages upon S. aureus infection and was required for proper transcriptional induction of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines .

256,"Age-related changes in the niche have long been postulated to impair the function of somatic stem cells . Here we demonstrate that the aged stem cell niche in skeletal muscle contains substantially reduced levels of fibronectin ( FN ) , leading to detrimental consequences for the function and maintenance of muscle stem cells ( MuSCs ) . Deletion of the gene encoding FN from young regenerating muscles replicates the aging phenotype and leads to a loss of MuSC numbers . By using an extracellular matrix ( ECM ) library screen and pathway profiling , we characterize FN as a preferred adhesion substrate for MuSCs and demonstrate that integrin-mediated signaling through focal adhesion kinase and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is strongly de-regulated in MuSCs from aged mice because of insufficient attachment to the niche .

257,"This paper seeks to establish the strength of association between contemporary tuberculosis ( TB ) in England and Wales and several potential aetiological factors . It presents an ecological analysis of standardised annual TB mortality rates for the 403 local authority districts between 1982 and 1992 , disaggregated by age and sex . Social , demographic and ethnicity measures from the 1981 and 1991 censuses and standardised annual AIDS-related mortality rates for young men are used to calculate Poisson regression models . A strong association was found between all TB mortality groups and overcrowding at the household level . For women , no other measures improved the explanatory power of the models . In multiple regressions , both poverty and AIDS-related mortality explained additional variation in the model for younger men . The link between ethnicity and tuberculosis notifications was not reflected in this analysis of mortality . For all groups no evidence of a positive relationship with ethnicity was found , once overcrowding had been accounted for . The significance of household as opposed to district level crowding suggests that prolonged contact is required for disease transmission . Regression analysis indicates that it is the overcrowding and poverty among ethnic populations that is significant for their tuberculosis mortality . The fact that the relationship between AIDS and TB is confined to the group most typical of AIDS patients provides evidence that AIDS has little influence on the level of tuberculosis mortality in the wider population . Explanations for the observed relationship include preferential certification , migration for treatment and shortcomings in health care provision . OBJECTIVE To examine the effect of ethnicity on the relation between tuberculosis and deprivation . DESIGN Retrospective ecological study comparing incidence of tuberculosis in white and south Asian residents of the 39 electoral wards in Birmingham with ethnic specific indices of deprivation . SETTING Birmingham , 1989 - 93 . SUBJECTS 1516 notified cases of tuberculosis . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Rates of tuberculosis and measures of deprivation . RESULTS Univariate analysis showed significant associations of tuberculosis rates for the whole population with several indices of deprivation ( P<0.01 ) and with the proportion of the population of south Asian origin ( P<0.01 ) . All deprivation covariates were positively associated with each other but on multiple regression , higher level of overcrowding was independently associated with tuberculosis rates . For the white population , overcrowding was associated with tuberculosis rates independently of other variables ( P=0.0036 ) . No relation with deprivation was found for the south Asian population in either single or multivariable analyses . CONCLUSIONS Poverty is significantly associated with tuberculosis in the white population , but no such relation exists for those of Asian ethnicity . These findings suggest that causal factors , and therefore potential interventions , will also differ by ethnic group .

DATA SOURCES Ovid Medline , Embase , and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to May 2012 , without restriction by language or publication status . REVIEW METHODS Randomised trials that compared ultrasound imaging with standard methods ( no imaging ) in the performance of a lumbar puncture or epidural catheterisation were identified . RESULTS 14 studies with a total of 1334 patients were included ( 674 patients assigned to the ultrasound group , 660 to the control group ) . Five studies evaluated lumbar punctures and nine evaluated epidural catheterisations . Six of 624 procedures conducted in the ultrasound group failed ; 44 of 610 procedures in the control group failed . Ultrasound imaging reduced the risk of failed procedures ( risk ratio 0.21 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.10 to 0.43 ) , P<0.001 ) . Risk reduction was similar when subgroup analysis was performed for lumbar punctures ( risk ratio 0.19 ( 0.07 to 0.56 ) , P=0.002 ) or epidural catheterisations ( 0.23 ( 0.09 to 0.60 ) , P=0.003 ) .

261,"Axons and dendrites differ in both microtubule organization and in the organelles and proteins they contain . Here we show that the microtubule motor dynein has a crucial role in polarized transport and in controlling the orientation of axonal microtubules in Drosophila melanogaster dendritic arborization ( da ) neurons . Changes in organelle distribution within the dendritic arbors of dynein mutant neurons correlate with a proximal shift in dendritic branch position . Dynein is also necessary for the dendrite-specific localization of Golgi outposts and the ion channel Pickpocket .

262,"The unique metabolic demands of cancer cells underscore potentially fruitful opportunities for drug discovery in the era of precision medicine . However , therapeutic targeting of cancer metabolism has led to surprisingly few new drugs to date . The neutral amino acid glutamine serves as a key intermediate in numerous metabolic processes leveraged by cancer cells , including biosynthesis , cell signaling , and oxidative protection . Herein we report the preclinical development of V-9302 , a competitive small molecule antagonist of transmembrane glutamine flux that selectively and potently targets the amino acid transporter ASCT2 . Pharmacological blockade of ASCT2 with V-9302 resulted in attenuated cancer cell growth and proliferation , increased cell death , and increased oxidative stress , which collectively contributed to antitumor responses in vitro and in vivo .

263,"Both rectal and vaginal mucosal surfaces serve as transmission routes for pathogenic microorganisms . Vaccination through large intestinal mucosa , previously proven protective for both of these mucosal sites in animal studies , can be achieved successfully by direct intracolorectal ( i.c.r . ) administration , but this route is clinically impractical . Oral vaccine delivery seems preferable but runs the risk of the vaccine 's destruction in the upper gastrointestinal tract . Therefore , we designed a large intestine-targeted oral delivery with pH-dependent microparticles containing vaccine nanoparticles , which induced colorectal immunity in mice comparably to colorectal vaccination and protected against rectal and vaginal viral challenge . Conversely , vaccine targeted to the small intestine induced only small intestinal immunity and provided no rectal or vaginal protection , demonstrating functional compartmentalization within the gut mucosal immune system . Therefore , using this oral vaccine delivery system to target the large intestine , but not the small intestine , may represent a feasible new strategy for immune protection of rectal and vaginal mucosa .

264,"IMPORTANCE Combining pharmacotherapies for tobacco-dependence treatment may increase smoking abstinence . OBJECTIVE To determine efficacy and safety of varenicline and bupropion sustained-release ( SR ; combination therapy ) compared with varenicline ( monotherapy ) in cigarette smokers . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized , blinded , placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial with a 12-week treatment period and follow-up through week 52 conducted between October 2009 and April 2013 at 3 midwestern clinical research sites . Five hundred six adult ( ≥18 years ) cigarette smokers were randomly assigned and 315 ( 62 % ) completed the study . INTERVENTIONS Twelve weeks of varenicline and bupropion SR or varenicline and placebo . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was abstinence rates at week 12 , defined as prolonged ( no smoking from 2 weeks after the target quit date ) abstinence and 7-day point-prevalence ( no smoking past 7 days ) abstinence . Secondary outcomes were prolonged and point-prevalence smoking abstinence rates at weeks 26 and 52 . Outcomes were biochemically confirmed . RESULTS At 12 weeks , 53.0 % of the combination therapy group achieved prolonged smoking abstinence and 56.2 % achieved 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence compared with 43.2 % and 48.6 % in varenicline monotherapy ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 1.49 ; 95 % CI , 1.05 - 2.12 ; P = .03 and OR , 1.36 ; 95 % CI , 0.95 - 1.93 ; P = .09 , respectively ) . At 26 weeks , 36.6 % of the combination therapy group achieved prolonged and 38.2 % achieved 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence compared with 27.6 % and 31.9 % in varenicline monotherapy ( OR , 1.52 ; 95 % CI , 1.04 - 2.22 ; P = .03 and OR , 1.32 ; 95 % CI , 0.91 - 1.91 ; P = .14 , respectively ) . At 52 weeks , 30.9 % of the combination therapy group achieved prolonged and 36.6 % achieved 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence compared with 24.5 % and 29.2 % in varenicline monotherapy ( OR , 1.39 ; 95 % CI , 0.93 - 2.07 ; P = .11 and OR , 1.40 ; 95 % CI , 0.96 - 2.05 ; P = .08 , respectively ) . Participants receiving combination therapy reported more anxiety ( 7.2 % vs 3.1 % ; P = .04 ) and depressive symptoms ( 3.6 % vs 0.8 % ; P = .03 ) . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among cigarette smokers , combined use of varenicline and bupropion , compared with varenicline alone , increased prolonged abstinence but not 7-day point prevalence at 12 and 26 weeks . Neither outcome was significantly different at 52 weeks . Further research is required to determine the role of combination therapy in smoking cessation .

266,"BACKGROUND Long-term exposure to pollution can lead to an increase in the rate of decline of lung function , especially in older individuals and in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , whereas shorter-term exposure at higher pollution levels has been implicated in causing excess deaths from ischaemic heart disease and exacerbations of COPD . We aimed to assess the effects on respiratory and cardiovascular responses of walking down a busy street with high levels of pollution compared with walking in a traffic-free area with lower pollution levels in older adults . METHODS In this randomised , crossover study , we recruited men and women aged 60 years and older with angiographically proven stable ischaemic heart disease or stage 2 Global initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease ( GOLD ) COPD who had been clinically stable for 6 months , and age-matched healthy volunteers . Individuals with ischaemic heart disease or COPD were recruited from existing databases or outpatient respiratory and cardiology clinics at the Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Foundation Trust and age-matched healthy volunteers using advertising and existing databases . All participants had abstained from smoking for at least 12 months and medications were taken as recommended by participants ' doctors during the study . Participants were randomly assigned by drawing numbered disks at random from a bag to do a 2 h walk either along a commercial street in London ( Oxford Street ) or in an urban park ( Hyde Park ) . Baseline measurements of participants were taken before the walk in the hospital laboratory . During each walk session , black carbon , particulate matter ( PM ) concentrations , ultrafine particles , and nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) concentrations were measured . FINDINGS Between October , 2012 , and June , 2014 , we screened 135 participants , of whom 40 healthy volunteers , 40 individuals with COPD , and 39 with ischaemic heart disease were recruited . Concentrations of black carbon , NO2 , PM10 , PM2.5 , and ultrafine particles were higher on Oxford Street than in Hyde Park . Participants with COPD reported more cough ( odds ratio [ OR ] 1·95 , 95 % CI 0·96 - 3·95 ; p<0·1 ) , sputum ( 3·15 , 1·39 - 7·13 ; p<0·05 ) , shortness of breath ( 1·86 , 0·97 - 3·57 ; p<0·1 ) , and wheeze ( 4·00 , 1·52 - 10·50 ; p<0·05 ) after walking down Oxford Street compared with Hyde Park . In all participants , irrespective of their disease status , walking in Hyde Park led to an increase in lung function ( forced expiratory volume in the first second [ FEV1 ] and forced vital capacity [ FVC ] ) and a decrease in pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) and augmentation index up to 26 h after the walk . By contrast , these beneficial responses were attenuated after walking on Oxford Street . In participants with COPD , a reduction in FEV1 and FVC , and an increase in R5 - 20 were associated with an increase in during-walk exposure to NO2 , ultrafine particles and PM2.5 , and an increase in PWV and augmentation index with NO2 and ultrafine particles . In healthy volunteers , PWV and augmentation index were associated both with black carbon and ultrafine particles . INTERPRETATION Short-term exposure to traffic pollution prevents the beneficial cardiopulmonary effects of walking in people with COPD , ischaemic heart disease , and those free from chronic cardiopulmonary diseases .

267,"CONTEXT While it is established that management strategies and outcomes differ by gender for many diseases , its effect on infection has not been adequately studied . OBJECTIVE To investigate the role of gender among hospitalized patients treated for infection . DESIGN Observational cohort study conducted during a 26-month period from December 1996 through January 1999 . SETTING University-affiliated hospital . PARTICIPANTS A total of 892 patients in the surgical units of the hospital with 1470 consecutive infectious episodes ( 782 in men and 688 in women ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Mortality during hospitalization by gender for infection episodes overall and for specific infectious sites , including lung , peritoneum , bloodstream , catheter , urine , surgical site , and skin/soft tissue . RESULTS Among all infections , there was no significant difference in mortality based on gender ( men , 11.1 % vs women , 14.2 % ; P = .07 ) . After logistic regression analysis , factors independently associated with mortality included higher APACHE ( Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation ) II score , older age , malignancy , blood transfusion , and diagnosis of infection more than 7 days after admission , but not gender ( female odds ratio [ OR ] for death , 1.32 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.90 - 1.94 ; P = .16 ) . Mortality was higher in women for lung ( men , 18 % vs women , 34 % ; P = .002 ) and soft tissue ( men , 2 % vs women , 10 % ; P < or = .05 ) infection ; for other infectious sites , mortality did not differ by gender . Factors associated with mortality due to pneumonia by logistic regression included higher APACHE II score , malignancy , diabetes mellitus , diagnosis of infection more than 7 days after admission , older age , transplantation , and female gender ( OR for death , 2.25 ; 95 % CI , 1.17 - 4.32 ; P = .02 ) .

We show that PKCζ deficiency promotes the plasticity necessary for cancer cells to reprogram their metabolism to utilize glutamine through the serine biosynthetic pathway in the absence of glucose . PKCζ represses the expression of two key enzymes of the pathway , PHGDH and PSAT1 , and phosphorylates PHGDH at key residues to inhibit its enzymatic activity . Interestingly , the loss of PKCζ in mice results in enhanced intestinal tumorigenesis and increased levels of these two metabolic enzymes , whereas patients with low levels of PKCζ have a poor prognosis . Furthermore , PKCζ and caspase-3 activities are correlated with PHGDH levels in human intestinal tumors .

The factors that determine the stimulatory potency of a pMHC molecule remain unclear . We describe results showing that a peptide exhibiting many hallmarks of a weak agonist stimulates T cells to proliferate more than the wild-type agonist ligand . An in silico approach suggested that the inability to form the central supramolecular activation cluster ( cSMAC ) could underlie the increased proliferation . This conclusion was supported by experiments that showed that enhancing cSMAC formation reduced stimulatory capacity of the weak peptide .

270,"Glioblastomas are deadly cancers that display a functional cellular hierarchy maintained by self-renewing glioblastoma stem cells ( GSCs ) . GSCs are regulated by molecular pathways distinct from the bulk tumor that may be useful therapeutic targets . We determined that A20 ( TNFAIP3 ) , a regulator of cell survival and the NF-kappaB pathway , is overexpressed in GSCs relative to non-stem glioblastoma cells at both the mRNA and protein levels . To determine the functional significance of A20 in GSCs , we targeted A20 expression with lentiviral-mediated delivery of short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) . Inhibiting A20 expression decreased GSC growth and survival through mechanisms associated with decreased cell-cycle progression and decreased phosphorylation of p65/RelA. Elevated levels of A20 in GSCs contributed to apoptotic resistance : GSCs were less susceptible to TNFalpha-induced cell death than matched non-stem glioma cells , but A20 knockdown sensitized GSCs to TNFalpha-mediated apoptosis . The decreased survival of GSCs upon A20 knockdown contributed to the reduced ability of these cells to self-renew in primary and secondary neurosphere formation assays . The tumorigenic potential of GSCs was decreased with A20 targeting , resulting in increased survival of mice bearing human glioma xenografts . In silico analysis of a glioma patient genomic database indicates that A20 overexpression and amplification is inversely correlated with survival . Together these data indicate that A20 contributes to glioma maintenance through effects on the glioma stem cell subpopulation . Although inactivating mutations in A20 in lymphoma suggest A20 can act as a tumor suppressor , similar point mutations have not been identified through glioma genomic sequencing : in fact , our data suggest A20 may function as a tumor enhancer in glioma through promotion of GSC survival . A20 anticancer therapies should therefore be viewed with caution as effects will likely differ depending on the tumor type . OBJECTIVE A20 is a TNF-inducible primary response gene , which has been found to have antiapoptotic function in several cancer cells . This study investigates A20 expression in human glioma tissues and four glioma cell lines , and its effect on tumorigenesis of glioma cells and a mouse tumor model . METHODS Human glioma tissue samples and cells were subject to reverse transcription-PCR ( RT-PCR ) , western blotting and immunohistochemistry . Glioma cells was tested by flow cytometry . A xenograft tumor model in mice was utilized to examine the knock-down effect of specific A20 siRNAs on tumorigenesis . RESULTS A20 was overexpressed in clinical glioma tissue samples ( 63.9 % ) and correlated with clinical staging . All four human glioma cell lines expressed A20 , among which U87 displayed the strongest expression signals . Inhibiting A20 expression by siRNAs in vitro reduced the growth rates of glioma cells and resulted in G1/S arrest and increased apoptosis . In a mouse tumor model , local administration of siRNA significantly suppressed solid tumor growth . CONCLUSIONS A20 was overexpressed both in human glioma tissues and cell lines , and inhibiting A20 expression greatly slowed tumor cell growth in culture and in mice . These findings indicated that A20 is involved in tumorigenesis of human glioma , and may serve as a future therapeutic target .

271,"Membrane attack complex/perforin-like ( MACPF ) proteins comprise the largest superfamily of pore-forming proteins , playing crucial roles in immunity and pathogenesis . Soluble monomers assemble into large transmembrane pores via conformational transitions that remain to be structurally and mechanistically characterised . Here we present an 11 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy ( cryo-EM ) structure of the two-part , fungal toxin Pleurotolysin ( Ply ) , together with crystal structures of both components ( the lipid binding PlyA protein and the pore-forming MACPF component PlyB ) . These data reveal a 13-fold pore 80 Å in diameter and 100 Å in height , with each subunit comprised of a PlyB molecule atop a membrane bound dimer of PlyA. The resolution of the EM map , together with biophysical and computational experiments , allowed confident assignment of subdomains in a MACPF pore assembly . The major conformational changes in PlyB are a ∼70 ° opening of the bent and distorted central β-sheet of the MACPF domain , accompanied by extrusion and refolding of two α-helical regions into transmembrane β-hairpins ( TMH1 and TMH2 ) . We determined the structures of three different disulphide bond-trapped prepore intermediates . Analysis of these data by molecular modelling and flexible fitting allows us to generate a potential trajectory of β-sheet unbending . The results suggest that MACPF conformational change is triggered through disruption of the interface between a conserved helix-turn-helix motif and the top of TMH2 . Following their release we propose that the transmembrane regions assemble into β-hairpins via top down zippering of backbone hydrogen bonds to form the membrane-inserted β-barrel . The intermediate structures of the MACPF domain during refolding into the β-barrel pore establish a structural paradigm for the transition from soluble monomer to pore , which may be conserved across the whole superfamily . The TMH2 region is critical for the release of both TMH clusters , suggesting why this region is targeted by endogenous inhibitors of MACPF function .
